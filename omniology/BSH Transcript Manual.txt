DVD 1 – Mentalization Techniques & The 
“Unfamiliar Room” 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Igor: 
Welcome everyone to the Beyond Self-Hypnosis Training. Who here is 
excited? I like to hear that. That’s good. This is going to be very similar to a lot 
of trainings you’ve been to before. It’s going to be different as well at the 
same time. 
 
 
Before we actually launch into the general things you can expect, let me just 
check who here has actually trained with me before? I see a lot of familiar 
faces. Who here has not trained in a live event before? Okay, great. Those of 
you who have not trained at a live event before, I presume you’ve got a DVD 
set or something like that. Is that correct? Who here has no idea who I am 
and you just walked in the room and thought, this looks all right? 
 
 
The reason I asked that is partly just to get a sense of who I have in the room. 
It’s also partly to give you a set of expectations. Those of you who have 
trained with me in my regular hypnosis trainings will know that it tends to be 
very fast action paced.  
 
 
You’re up in the room, you’re constantly talking to different people and it’s 
very appropriate in a hypnosis setting to do that because you need to talk to a 
lot of people because there will be different minds you’re interacting with to 
get the skills that you want to do. 
 
 
Here today and for the next five days, we’re actually working in a slightly 
different premise. This is all about you this time. It’s not about what you can 
do with other people. This is about what you do with yourself, which means I 
really don’t care whether or not you have any interaction with someone else 
in this room at all.  
 
 
You can do everything in the privacy of your mind, or I’ll show you when we 
get to the exercises that there will be an opportunity for you to work with 
someone else.

What I advise you to do, however, whether you decide to work with other 
people or not – if you don’t want to work with other people, that’s fine. Just 
do your thing and I’ll explain when we get to the exercise portion how to do 
that part. 
 
 
If you are going to work with other people, I strongly recommend you just 
work with the person sitting right next to you. The reason for that is because 
it will save you a lot of time – or it will save us as a group a lot of time – and 
that way we can just do more work rather than spend time trying to get 
people back from exercises and so on. Does that make sense? 
 
 
It doesn’t really matter who you’re talking to in these exercises. It’s all about 
you this time. It’s not about what other people are doing or responding. It’s 
just to get that idea of understanding into you. Rest assured for those of you 
who like their privacy or who are shy, you can do this all entirely in the privacy 
of your mind.  
 
 
It’s a little harder to do it on your own than with someone else. When we get 
into the actual content you’ll see why, but it’s perfectly possible and very 
doable. When I travel, I don’t talk to the little old lady on the airplane next to 
me and freak her out. I just freak myself out and that’s plenty of work. Thank 
you very much. 
 
 
The next thing that is a little different about this training is that in other 
trainings you may have come across, especially in the hypnotherapy type of 
trainings, we ask you to be responsible for your own learning and to be 
responsible adults and not go wailing off and doing all kinds of stuff. 
 
 
This idea of being a responsible adult is particularly important in this training. 
You may have noticed that our sign-up sheet looked a little different this time. 
You also put in a medical or psychological disclaimer. In other words, no one 
here is currently under psychiatric supervision and if you’re on medication 
you’re taking it. Is that correct? 
 
 
This is very important because the territory we’re going to go into here, if you 
enter the territory stepwise in progression as we’ll be doing, it is very safe. If 
you already have a very loose grip on reality, this will not help you – or rather 
it will help you but only after you’ve solidified the grasp on the reality.

So, if you’re going through a particularly tough time – and this is particularly 
for you at home if you’re watching this, which I hope you are – there are 
certain exercises – and I’ll identify them for you – that you do not want to be 
doing until you practice other exercises first that will help you build the 
resources, the brain architecture you need to do the more advanced exercises 
safely. 
 
 
One thing I can guarantee for all of you is if you go through the ASH 
Progression – this training is something called the ASH Method, which I made 
up so I guess it really doesn’t matter.  
 
 
If you go through the progression properly, you’ll be reaching parts of your 
own unconscious mind that you’ve never reached before and without the 
help of a very competent hypnotherapist, you probably would never reach in 
your entire lifetime either. 
 
 
That means great things for you, but it also means at some point your ability 
to face your own shadow, the dark side of your own personality, the thing 
that you’ve buried in the basement and don’t want to look at – we won’t 
necessarily be opening that particular basement whilst we’re here. We’ll be 
taking a peek at it for sure, but we won’t be going down into it. 
 
 
Here’s the reason why. Before you go into the basement to reclaim all the lost 
items that have fallen down the cracks into the basement and are mingled in 
with all the bogeymen down there, you need to make sure that your mind has 
lifelines and it can do it safely, which means we need to change the way your 
brain is built basically. 
 
 
We’re going to change the architecture of your brain, and the reason for that 
is it will create anchor points, safety mechanisms so that no matter what 
happens, no matter how bad things get, you always have an out and you’ll 
always know that you can deal with it safely. You’ll never get confronted with 
more than is safe for you. Does that make sense? 
 
 
Now hopefully you’re beginning to appreciate a little bit now why I asked for, 
especially in the live group, that medical disclaimer that you’re not crazy or 
whether you’re under some kind of psychological supervision because if you 
are currently in some kind of psychotherapy, it probably means that you’re 
more vulnerable, which means the areas we’ll go are more close to the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

surface and they may pop out before you’re ready to handle them on your 
own. 
 
 
With a therapist, that’s fine but you’re not going to be having a therapist here. 
I’m not going to be going around to each one of you and individually fixing 
you.  
 
 
The similarities with other courses you may have done with me before is that 
there will be a lot of onus on you to do work because the point of this seminar 
is not for me to show you how good I am at doing this. My mind is wonderful 
and I love it. Thank you very much. The point is for you to have a skill you can 
take home that will help you transform your life in some way.  
 
 
At this point I need to talk a little bit about how this is different from 
hopefully pretty much anything else that you’ve seen. To some extent a lot of 
the surface level things that we’ll be doing may look similar. Has anyone here 
done visualizations, guided visualizations and stuff like that?  
 
 
You’ll be very familiar with the rough topic of what we’ll be doing here only it 
will occur very, very differently. In other words, what’s happening underneath 
the surface will be much more powerful. It depends on really where you are in 
terms of your personal journey shall we say, but let’s put it this way.  
 
 
In the people I’ve taught this program to so far – albeit it was one-to-one 
rather than in a big group setting – every single person at some point 
throughout the program has burst into tears of joy, relief or gratitude, and 
that includes people who were pretty much dead from neck down. 
Sometimes up as well, who knows? 
 
 
Now I can’t make the same guarantee for all of you because working with a 
larger group, I can’t personalize each particular exercise and catch the 
moment as easily for you, but I will show you how to catch your own 
moments to achieve that, which means I fully anticipate that at least half of 
you will burst into tears of joy, gratitude or relief at some point during this 
seminar. 
 
 
I’m saying that not because I want to see you cry, although it would be 
gratifying in a positive sense. I’m saying that for you to understand that we’ll 
be doing something very powerful and it’s important that you follow through 
the progression each step as we go along.

There will be certain exercises you do for safety to build up some part of your 
brain architecture which will keep you safe through the progression. There 
will be certain exercises we’ll do in order to be able to dive into your own 
unconscious and find the material that you need to learn from to grow as a 
person, and they need to balance each other out. 
 
 
That balance will be very difficult to do in a large group because it will be a 
different mix for each one of you, which means what I expect you to do is if at 
some point an exercise starts getting to the point where you feel a little bit 
unsure about it like it’s getting too much for you, then either sit out the 
exercise or, more importantly, go back to one of the other exercises like the 
mindfulness stuff that we’ll be doing as part of this course, which will help 
build the mental muscle you will need to be able to go through that door that 
you weren’t quite sure of before. 
 
 
Now I can’t tell you which door is going to be problematic for you to go 
through and which one isn’t because I’m not working with each one of you 
individually.  
 
 
If I’m doing it on a one-to-one basis, it’s a lot of easier to tell because the rule 
of thumb is go through and if it doesn’t work out, I’ll help drag you out again 
with my other skills.  
 
 
That’s not the case here, so I need you to be responsible for yourselves and 
pay attention to what’s going on inside you so that you can make the 
decision, is this a place I want to go into right now or not? I will of course 
point out the exercises where this will be of particularly value to you, and 
particularly for those of you watching at home. 
 
 
For today, which is going to be the first four sessions, pretty much everything 
we do is going to be very safe. It’s going to be building up the foundations on 
which we’ll be working.  
 
 
From tomorrow onwards, we’re going to start going more and more to the 
unconscious level to the stuff that’s inside you, and that’s the point where you 
need to start paying more attention to yourself and decide do I go through 
this fully, do I just sit it out and do something else like a mindfulness practice 
instead to build up the mental muscle to deal with it, or do I just tip my toe in 
and try it out for a little bit and then withdraw and do something else.

That’s a mix that you have to decide for yourself because that’s why we have 
an emotional system. Your emotions tell you when something’s going right 
and when something’s going wrong, particularly in the kind of work we’ll be 
doing here. Do you understand what I mean by that? 
 
 
Rest assured there will be plenty of opportunities for you to ask questions and 
clarify. If there’s any doubt at all, then simply ask because that’s what I’m 
here for.  
 
 
If there’s any doubt about a particular exercise or any concerns about 
whether or not you’re ready for that particular thing, talk to me and I’ll ask 
you some questions about where your concerns are coming from, and I’ll be 
able to help you hopefully make that decision for yourself as well. Make 
sense? 
 
 
This is important because these safety aspects are very, very important. Let 
me explain what the problem is with regular visualizations, guided 
visualizations and so on. I started doing that sort of work when I was a 
teenager.  
 
 
Like most people do, I picked up a book and said oh this is great. I started 
trying it out and some things worked fantastic. I could relax so well that my 
mattress needed to be replaced because I was just falling through to the floor 
constantly.  
 
 
Other things did not work at all and I was always puzzled by this. How many of 
you have done visualizations and guided visualizations before? Let me just 
map out some of the difficulties or some of the problems that you may have 
experienced, and please let me know whether or not this matches your 
experiences. 
 
 
Number one, some of them are just impossible to do. Some of the things you 
have to try to visualize are so detailed and complex, it’s like what the heck, 
how am I supposed to do that? By the end of today or definitely by the end of 
tomorrow you should be able to visualize things as proficiently as a Yogi who’s 
been sitting in a cave for the last 20 years doing it. I kid you not. 
 
 
Some of you won’t necessarily get to that point by the end of today because 
you may have to spend more time on the stuff we’re doing today to build the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
12 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
mental muscle but once that mental muscle is built, then the problem will not 
be turning it on; it will be turning it off, which is why we’re building another 
mental muscle afterwards, which will be your off switch. Does that make 
sense? 
 
 
The second problem is you do these wonderful visualizations and they’re 
usually somewhere along the lines of this – there’s the cave of dreams and 
the fairy queen bestows a gift on you and you feel happy. No I don’t. Yes you 
do. No I don’t. 
 
 
The problem here is someone is putting their fish into your dream. It’s their 
symbology, which works great for them and when they think of the fairy 
queen, my God they light up like a Christmas tree. Of course they expect 
everyone else too, but symbolism doesn’t work that way. 
 
 
You don’t have other people’s dreams do you? When you go to sleep at night, 
do you call up your friends and check with them – which dream can I borrow 
from you tonight because the last time you seemed to have some really cool 
ones and mine are a little dull of late, so can I borrow yours? 
 
 
No, you don’t. Your unconscious furnishes whatever you need at that point in 
your own period of evolution, so you can’t start using other people’s symbols. 
You have to use your own. Then the other problem is what do we mean by 
your own?  
 
 
Most people when they try to customize symbols ask and say would you like 
this symbol? Oh, that sounds great. Then you try it out and it works much 
better than someone imposing one on you, but you have your conscious mind 
and you have your unconscious mind.  
 
 
Your conscious mind will select certain symbols that its familiar with and will 
like, and your unconscious mind will select other symbols that you will not 
consciously be familiar with and you may not even like some of them, but you 
will learn from them and that is the important thing. 
 
 
You have to allow your unconscious mind to do the work and then it becomes 
easy for you. The only hard part in the whole process is getting to trust your 
unconscious mind enough that the right symbols, the right archetypal forces 
will emerge from inside you to achieve whatever it is that you’ve been 
wanting to achieve in that particular session.

As you may have gathered by now, when we talk about the ASH Method – 
the A stands for Archetypal Forces. This is going more into the Jungian 
traditional. We’re talking about things that are inside us or rather tendencies 
that we all have as human beings that can express themselves in different 
ways. 
 
 
We’re going to create a Stable Mental Platform to allow those forces to 
express themselves symbolically to you so that they have meaning to you, so 
that they can actually have a chance to change you as a human being. That’s 
the S part of the ASH program.  
 
 
The H stands for The Hero’s Journey. How many of you are familiar with the 
idea of The Hero’s Journey by Joseph Campbell? The reason I brought up that 
term is because really it fits very much what we’ll be doing here. The hero in 
the Campbell style myth somehow has to go through a process where he 
enters an altered type of reality. The adventure begins there. 
 
 
He has to confront something, gain the boon, the power of some sort and 
then return with that power back to the regular world so that life becomes 
different. That’s a rough cut, the shortened version of the whole thing. 
 
 
That’s exactly the same process you’ll be doing. Whenever you’re going to 
work on yourself in this way, you’re going to basically enter the unconscious 
territory. You’re going to be entering it in a safe way.  
 
 
In other words, you’re going to be building up processes to allow you to enter 
safely so that whether the things that you’re interacting with are positive or 
negative, you’ll be safe regardless. 
 
 
The good news is your unconscious mind has a lifetime of practice protecting 
you. There is an amount of things that you have forgotten just because your 
conscious mind can’t handle it yet. There’s an amount of things you tried to 
get access to and been denied because your conscious mind is not ready to 
deal with it yet. 
 
 
Some of you maybe have seen a therapist or a hypnotherapist to deal with 
the problem and may even have failed, which is fantastic. I mean that because 
the fact that you failed is a sign that your unconscious mind didn’t trust that 
particular therapist enough to let that particular cat out of that particular bag.

You have protective mechanisms in place and whilst we’ll be showing you 
how to open doors to get around those protective mechanisms, you can only 
do that to the extent that you develop other protective mechanisms so you 
can do so safely. Do you understand what I mean by that? We have a 
question. 
 
Student: The first one is years ago I saw a hypnotist, and he was very experienced and 
with the intention of becoming better, but what happened is that I became 
worse and I didn’t even know why… 
 
Igor: 
Can I pause your second question a second? Let me give you a half answer 
and I’ll give you a fuller answer later because I know exactly where you’re 
coming from with this. In fact one of the people I taught this course to in my 
beta testing group had a very similar experience. 
 
 
We did a particular goal-setting process, which is quite different from the 
standard goal-setting – build it and the universe or achieve things, and 
sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t type things – and something very 
interesting happened. 
 
 
For about two months afterwards – he was building career goals. He just had 
a baby and needed to basically double his income. How many of you have 
children? For a little thing like a baby, it’s a lot of expense isn’t it? So, he ends 
up spending the next two months sitting on the couch watching TV and he 
just can’t get motivated to do anything, which is bizarre. 
 
 
So, we had another chat and again we used these processes. The reason I 
don’t want to give you the whole thing is because we need to have gone 
through a whole bunch of experiences to explain how that works.  
 
 
But anyway I showed him how to use the same things he was learning in the 
first place to tackle that particular thing and he had what he said was one of 
the biggest breakthroughs in his life at that point. His career is lifting off in the 
same way right now.  
 
 
He just sent me an email last night telling me about the people he’d been 
meeting, like the people who started Google and PayPal – so not small names 
– are getting involved in some of his projects, which is quite nice. This is from 
a person who couldn’t get off the couch from watching TV for a while.

The reason that happened is important, and that’s the bit that I won’t answer 
just yet because we need to set some foundations before we get there. So, I 
totally understand where you’re coming from. I can guarantee that to some of 
you the exact same thing will happen but – and this is the important thing – I 
won’t leave you there.  
 
 
I will show you how to deal with that because that’s just basically your 
unconscious mind inviting you to take the next step that you haven’t taken 
yet. Can I pause your second question for a moment because I want to just 
talk to that point a little bit? 
 
 
Those of you who saw the sales letter for this seminar may be familiar with 
this metaphor, but I want to give it to you anyway because it’s very important. 
Consider a person living in Bucket Land. It’s nicely bucket-shaped and it has 
whatever color you wish it to have, but it is a bucket. 
 
 
Inside of Bucket Land, there’s a little prison and this person’s caught inside 
the prison. Looking outside of the prison, he sees all the wonderful things that 
are happening in Bucket Land. There are little lakes and there are people 
having picnics and it looks fun out there.  
 
 
He doesn’t like it in prison, so he goes through what I would call traditional 
self-improvement methods – self-hypnosis for example and some forms of 
meditation, and meditations we’ll handle slightly differently when we get to 
the segment on that. 
 
 
There are a million different methods, and he learned how to break out of his 
prison and for a while he’s overjoyed. He’s running around the prairies 
dancing away and having a wonderful time until one day he hits something, 
some invisible barrier that he can’t quite understand. 
 
 
He’s come to the edge of Bucket Land where the bucket is, so what does he 
do? He turns to one side and walks around and for a while it’s fine because 
he’s constantly exploring new things and life is full of joy, but eventually 
Bucket Land being finite, he runs out of things to explore.  
 
 
He knows everything. Everything is usual. Nothing is new, so really Bucket 
Land becomes a new prison for him. He gets bored, frustrated, angry maybe, 
depressed. I know no one here has ever felt these things, right?

He feels like his life’s going nowhere, like he’s walking around in circles 
because he is, because he’s explored up to the limits of whatever map shall 
we say his mind’s allowed him to have, and this is where he gets stuck in a 
very frustrating place because any goal that you can conceive within Bucket 
Land is by definition limited to Bucket Land because your conscious mind can 
only work with what’s around it. 
 
 
The only time people leave Bucket Land in normal life is when something so 
dramatic happens in their life that turns it upside down, which basically spills 
Bucket Land over and forces them out, and for a while life is deeply 
unpleasant until they learn that they’re now in Bathtub Land. It’s much bigger 
but still has constraints. 
 
 
Do you understand the metaphor so far? What we’ll be doing here is we’ll be 
talking directly to that part of you that’s responsible for creating Bucket Land 
as a safe environment, and then Bathtub Land around that and then 
Swimming Pool Land around that, and you can carry on with larger vessels if 
you like around that ad infinitum. 
 
 
Whenever one type of reality, one way of being no longer serves you and 
you’ve outgrown it, you can engage in a process that will relatively painlessly 
allow you to go to the next stage in your personal transformation so that you 
can then go back to enjoying life’s riches and so on but in a way that you 
cannot conceive of right now, because if you could conceive of it right now 
then it wouldn’t be out there; it would still be in here. 
 
 
Do you understand the dilemma that we face in the self-improvement 
industry? Now if you’re working with a therapist, that’s a little easier to do 
because your therapist is not in your Bucket Land because if he’s in your 
Bucket Land, he can’t help you. 
 
 
If they have the same issues as you, it’s going to be very difficult for them to 
help you because they don’t have the insight of what it’s like to be outside of 
that.  
 
 
So, what a good therapist will say is I’m sorry I can’t help you with that, but 
tell me if you find somebody who can because I’ll join you; or if they stand 
outside of your bucket enough, they can say oh, you’re just stuck in Bucket 
Land and let me help you out of that. That’s what a good therapist will do,

whether it’s hypnotherapy or something else. Do you understand the 
analogy? 
 
 
The dilemma is when you’re doing it on yourself, you don’t have that external 
perspective, or rather you don’t have access to it consciously, but given that 
your unconscious mind can create the bucket – for your security by the way 
because it makes you feel safe, constrained it for safety – you can have a chat 
with the same one that built Bucket Land so that they can show you how to 
carve a hole in it and slowly and safely – that’s the important part – explore 
what happens outside of it. Do you understand that? 
 
 
That’s kind of what happened in your example. Someone took you outside of 
Bucket Land but life got a lot worse because you didn’t have the coping skills 
for dealing with outside, so your dilemma was stay here in pain long enough 
to figure out how this undiscovered country works, or go back in the bucket 
where it’s safe.  
 
 
I don’t know which choice you made and I don’t need to know, but the point 
is that is the choice where people tend to say I give up, I’m going to what’s 
safe and they become very small as people.  
 
 
That’s not a judgment call on them by the way. It is a natural phenomenon 
when you’re dealing with something that is overwhelming for you. You go 
back to what you know and what is safe, and that’s absolutely appropriate.  
 
 
What we’ll be focusing on here is how to explore that unknown so that it’s 
safe at each step of the way. It won’t always be comfortable by the way, but 
I’ll show you how to make that discomfort safe and useful. 
 
 
By the way, when I say I’ll show you how to make that safe and useful, it 
doesn’t mean that you can only change to discomfort. There are some things 
that will be amazing and you’ll just enjoy the ride all the way through, and 
there are other things where you’ll have to go through a period of discomfort 
because that’s part of where the learning comes from. 
 
 
So, there will be a grab bag. I’m not going to expect you to go home, bring 
your cat o’ nine tails and whip yourselves into enlightenment. That’s not this 
kind of school. Does that address some of your concerns? We’ll add more as 
we go along, so please keep the question in mind. You had a second question 
as well.

Student: It’s in the same mind. It seems to be part of my own nature that I always knew 
there’s this Bucket Land, so I’m not as descriptive as you, so my tendencies 
seem to be I will go into unchartered land even if I’m totally unprepared. 
Everything is better than staying in the bucket and that’s not safe. I will stay 
there until I’m totally burned out. 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly what we’ll be doing here. We have five days to do some work 
together. I have taught this process to some people in two very intense days, 
and to be fair at the end of those two days we didn’t finish the entire program 
because their mind had had enough and just switched off, but they got like 
95% of it in those two days, and this was someone who’s very, very used to 
making big changes fast. 
 
 
So, we have to spread the same amount of time over five days and even then 
I fully expect that some of you will decide I’ve had enough, I’m not going to do 
these more advanced things just yet, I’m going to go back to the more basic 
things and just get used to them.  
 
 
We’ll give you all the exercises and you’ll still have those available to you once 
you’ve built up other mechanisms to make it safe. The reason I can’t 
guarantee all of you will have this massive breakthrough in here is as follows. 
 
 
Let’s imagine that I was a personal fitness trainer, and I took you into a gym or 
whatever method of training we agreed on and for five days I put you through 
hell. You lift weights, you run, you do press-ups until you’re sick – you know 
the good healthy stuff that we all love, right? 
 
 
After five days all of you would suddenly be as fit and as strong as an Olympic 
athlete, wouldn’t you? Why not? Why wouldn’t you be as fit and as strong as 
an Olympic athlete? I’m working you harder than one. Why wouldn’t you be 
as strong or as fit?  
 
 
It’s because your body requires time to adapt. Your muscles don’t grow in 
seconds. You have to go through a period of training them to what they can 
cope with. Then your body goes oh my goodness, I better grow a little bit 
more and you grow a little bit more. That takes a bit of time. 
 
 
Then you go back and you do some more work at a higher level of intensity, 
and it goes oh, I better grow some more. It’s an incremental process, but if 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
19 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you understand that process you can grow at the rate that your body needed 
to grow rather than at some externally imposed rate. 
 
 
At this seminar here, we have a slight dilemma because I have material to 
teach you or to show you, but your mind – working with the analogy of the 
muscle – will only be able to grow at the rate that it can grow, which is right 
for you as an individual, which means at some point you’re going to have to 
take a timeout.  
 
 
You’re going to have to take a pause and just say I’ll listen to the exercise and 
I’ll record it and I’ll use it at some point, but not yet. I’m not doing it now. 
Even if you did all the exercises all the way through, you may still not get the 
entire results yet because it takes time to build up the mental strength 
required. 
 
 
Has anyone here ever done meditation? Hands up. Let me ask you more 
interestingly. Has anyone here ever tried meditation and gave up because it 
was just impossible to do? It’s hard, boring, frustrating – name whatever 
negative epitaph you want to put onto that.  
 
 
You see an experienced meditator sitting there for 10 hours a day going oh 
that’s just so good, and you’re doing it for two seconds and saying this is so 
bad. You have a differently sized mental muscle. They persevered long 
enough to build that muscle through sheer brute force. In the old school of 
weight training, you keep lifting that bar until you can’t lift it. Oh, I can’t lift it. 
Oh, I put my back out. Oh, I’ll try again. 
 
 
Eventually your body adapts but it’s a very painful way of doing it. We’re 
going to do a progressive version so you’ll say oh, this weight is easy. I’m 
bored with this weight, so I’ll go with another weight. You’re going to be 
incrementally increasing your mental capacities to cope with the intensity of 
the work you’ll be doing here. 
 
 
That means something. That means that for those who have larger problems, 
you’re going to take longer to build up more muscle to deal with them, unless 
already your life experiences have built those particular muscles, in which 
case you’ll be able to run with it as well. 
 
 
I’m not saying this to discourage you. I’m actually saying this to encourage 
you. The larger the issues that you’re facing – and this is particularly true of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
20 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you at home – the smaller the steps need to be at the beginning because you 
don’t have very much mental energy and strength left for other tasks. Most of 
your energy is used containing the problem. 
 
 
The more you build strength with what you’ve got left over, the more of that 
problem you can start cycling out, which means your resources start growing 
and growing.  
 
 
Along with your resources, because you’re using that mental muscle, you get 
mentally stronger as well, so you have more resources and more strength, 
which means that you can cope with more and more and more as time goes 
by. 
 
 
There’s one piece of advice I’ll give all of you, especially those of you who are 
doing this at home. Don’t rush. Don’t seek to be at the end straightaway. 
Nirvana will wait for you. It’s in no hurry, nor should you be.  
 
 
You’re better off working consistently and systematically and knowing where 
you’re going each step of the way - and you will by the end of this program by 
the way - and then letting your mind teach you how to progress, than trying 
to be at the end straightaway and ruining it all by having a very unstable 
platform and ultimately ending up in the middle of Bathtub Land in a very 
scary place. Maybe even at the drain where the spiders are crawling around 
and being afraid you’re going to be sucked down into Water Tank Land – I 
don’t know. Do you get the idea? 
 
 
You may have noticed I’m doing a lot of emphasizing around the idea of safety 
here. That’s because I know where you’re going. You’ll enjoy it and it will be 
great fun, but I need to warn you not to be in a rush to do anything. Just let 
your mind work at your pace because those safety mechanisms inside your 
mind are there for a reason. 
 
 
If you’re a reasonably stable human being – which most of us are – it will only 
release those safety mechanisms to the extent that it knows you can cope 
with it, which means you have other ways of dealing with whatever it’s 
protecting you from. 
 
 
The only people that don’t have that are people who have much larger issues 
like schizophrenia, psychosis and so on. Personally – and this will be a medical 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

disclaimer here – I’m not going to make any comments in terms of whether or 
not it can work for it.  
 
 
I believe the process that we’ll use here can work for that also, and I’ll explain 
why when we get to some of the mindfulness practices and so on but I have 
no medical evidence for it, so I’m not making a claim for that. It’s very 
important you understand that there’s a difference between what I believe, 
what I anticipate from my experiences and so on, and the complete absence 
of research on that point. You understand that there’s a difference between 
the two, right? 
 
 
So, we’re coming back to the idea of mental stability again. We’re always 
going to come back to the same point. We have two separate but importantly 
intertwined tasks to perform over the next five days. 
 
 
One task is to ground you, to keep you in reality, to keep you safe. That builds 
one type of mental muscle. Over a long period of time, those kind of 
practices, a lot of research has shown, can make wonderful transformations in 
your life, but it requires a lot of time and a lot of practice.  
 
To speed things up, we’re going to do other exercises and other practices that 
will help you fly; hence, the medical disclaimer here. If you’re already 
borderline, like a psychotic can’t tell the difference between one reality and 
another reality – that’s part of what psychosis is about – if you have problems 
with that, flying is not where you need to go first, it’s grounding. 
 
If you fly too high, then the old Icarus legend comes in. You may get a little bit 
burned by the sun. You need to be able to learn to fly and ground, fly and 
ground and that way you have the option of the fastest safest route to 
discovering what Bathtub Land is all about. Does that make sense? 
 
So, I’ve done a lot of talking so far. It’s time for you to do a lot of talking. This 
is going to be one of the few exercises we’ll do that we’ll do as a big group. 
What I want you to do, whilst taking care not to knock the equipment over, I’d 
like for you to go around the room and meet as many people as you can. 
 
Basically introduce yourselves, be socially polite – I’m whatever your name is, 
tell them a little bit about yourself and so on – but the two things I want you 
to really focus are: 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
22 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
1. Why did you come here? What do you think you want to get out of this 
program? What drove you to get on a plane and fly to Dublin?  
 
How many of you are from Dublin? That’s about five of you, so the rest of you 
came here. I’m not surprised. So, what on earth drove you to fly all the way 
here to learn this stuff? 
 
2. How has our little discussion to set everything up as an expectation 
affected your understanding or your hopes for what you want to 
achieve here? 
 
Do you understand the two things you’ll be talking about to each other? 
Because you know that I like to work at a faster pace because usually you can 
cope with it, you have eight minutes to do that with pretty much everyone in 
the room. Ready? Off you go. 
 
Welcome back everyone. How was that? Did you have fun with that? Who 
here is getting more excited now that they’ve had a little chance to think 
about what’s coming up? Who here kind of had to get a little scared into 
being more excited? A little bit of fear is actually very useful for two reasons. 
 
Believe it or not, in terms of how your brain architecture is built, if you want 
to build more connections inside your brain, you need a bunch of chemicals. 
Your emotional states will decide whether or not there is more or less of 
those chemicals running around your brain. 
 
As a rule, all the positive emotions increase the amounts of brain chemicals 
that your neurology has to wire together more efficiently. As a rule, strong 
negative emotions have the opposite effect. They inhibit it. In other words, 
they retard the learning process. They stop your brain from changing and 
learning and so on, except very small amounts of stress or anxiety actually 
increase it equally to the positive emotions. 
 
So, the first reason you still get a little bit worried is because your brain is 
learning better that way. The second reason to be a little bit worried is 
because you’re at the edge of your learning process at that point. You know 
something important is about to happen.

You understand the difference between just a little anxiety and a lot, right? A 
lot of anxiety looks like this. If I see that look, then we’ll have a chat about 
calming things down a little bit. 
 
Influencing The Unconscious 
 
Igor: 
Our first task is going to be to create a stable platform so that we can interact 
as a conscious mind with the unconscious mind. Allow me to present to you a 
metaphor for this.  
 
By the way, I’ll be giving you lots of metaphors or analogies, and the reason 
for it is because whilst the English language is very rich, it is very poor as a 
descriptor of the kinds of mental processes that we’ll be talking about. The 
English language is a great master of the external world – for example the 
word wade. The English language is one of the few languages that actually has 
a word for walking through water. That’s interesting, right? 
 
But when it comes to the internal environment, it doesn’t have the right 
vocabulary for it, you need to turn it into a very interesting language like 
Sanskrit or something like that because they focus more on the internal realm 
so they developed a vocabulary for it, which we haven’t done at least in the 
English world. 
 
So, we need to have a lot of analogies and anecdotes and metaphors that will 
help you understand an internal process because we don’t have language to 
refer back to it. One of the things we’ll be doing is going through some very 
controlled mental experiments so that we can have a shared language so that 
when I say do X, you understand what I mean. 
 
For example, if I told you to use benign attention right now, you might say I 
kind of get an idea of what he means by that, but you probably wouldn’t have 
really an idea of what it means, because you haven’t had an experience of it 
yet. Does that make sense to everyone? 
 
So, the first thing we’ll be doing is we’re going to start building up a shared 
vocabulary about our internal experiences so that we can use that to point 
out scenery in our mental landscape that will be of use and value to you.

The second thing we need to do, to use another analogy – has anyone here 
ever used a computer? Some hands haven’t gone up yet, so you’re either 
lying or you’re living in the Stone Age. If my vast understanding of IT is 
correct, then computers essentially work on binary codes – zeros and ones, on 
and off.  
 
There are millions of these zeroes and ones – these on and off switches – 
which then accumulate and allow the computer to perform a particular task, 
whether it’s word processing, emailing or whatever. I presume that few if 
none at all of you can read binary code and understand exactly what it means. 
Would that be fair to say? If you had a bit of binary code, you’d go oh yes, 
that’s a picture of the Mona Lisa in binary code. 
 
So, what does a computer do? We have a screen that becomes a translator. It 
becomes a platform so that the computer can speak to you about what it’s 
doing in a way that you can understand. So, when you see the picture of the 
Mona Lisa, the computer is actually just seeing ones and zeroes and you’re 
seeing the picture of the Mona Lisa and you’re both happy.  
 
When you draw a little mustache on the Mona Lisa, the computer sees zeros 
and ones and you see a mustache and you’re both happy. It knows what to do 
and you know what to do. Do you understand the process there? 
 
If we extend that analogy to the way your mind operates, most of your 
unconscious processes are a mystery to you. They’re the same as the zeroes 
and ones going on electronically inside a computer.  
 
So, if you want to be able to influence them, you’ll need to have some kind of 
a stable platform to translate your wishes so that it understands and vice 
versa, for it to present information to you so that you understand what you 
need to do to make things happen as well.  
 
This by the way is one of the reasons why imposed symbols do not work. They 
only work after years and years and years of study because then the 
unconscious mind goes all right I get it, this means that. Fine, we’ll work with 
that now.  
 
However, it requires a lot of effort to get your unconscious to accept that 
particular symbol to mean this particular thing for you, instead of just using 
what it wants to use already. Do you understand what I’m talking about here?

Now that’s going more to what we’ll be doing tomorrow and the day after. 
Before we can even get towards that, we need to have the ability to actually 
even turn our minds inwards and have a stable experience so that we can talk 
to our unconscious mind and know that we’re being listened to. 
 
Stable Mentalizations 
 
Igor: 
If you’ve tried things like visualizations in the past, it can be very difficult. I’m 
going to show you in a moment how to turn that on its head very quickly, and 
it will require practice, a little bit more from some than from others. 
 
Instead of using the word visualization, I’m going to use the word 
mentalization. That will be for two reasons. I want you to use a different word 
than what you’re used to so that it’s clean of associations, so that you only 
associate to mentalization the processes we’ll be doing here, so when I ask 
you to mentalize something you’ll understand I need to do this process. 
 
If I ask you to visualize something, you might accidentally end up doing some 
of the things you’ve done in the past, which don’t really have any bearing on 
what we’ll be doing here. Do you understand the distinction I’m trying to 
make here? 
 
Has anyone here ever failed at doing visualizations? It’s also useful for those 
things because it’s not that. Whatever you did to fail there, we won’t be doing 
here. One of the key things in terms of mentalizing things is we just want to 
be able to have access to a mental experience that’s stable enough for us to 
work with it. 
 
Does everyone here live somewhere sheltered outside of the streets? You 
don’t live under a bridge, is that correct? You live in a house, a home, an 
apartment or something like that and I presume you spend a reasonable 
amount of time there, so you know it well. 
 
If I asked all of you to describe your bedroom to me or your kitchen to me or a 
room that you’re very familiar with in your house, it would be easy for you to 
describe the room to me. Would that be fair to say? You could tell me the 
computer is there and this is here, and we’ve got a picture of so and so there 
because you’re there every single day. It’s just natural to you, right? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
26 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Now let’s compare it to another room that you’re less familiar with. You could 
describe it but it would be a little bit more difficult to think about it because 
you don’t know it as well. Would that be fair to say also? 
 
So, some rooms you know very well like the proverbial back of your hand, and 
other rooms you know less well, maybe like the front of your hand – I don’t 
know.  
 
What I would like you to do now – and this is going to be the first of many 
rounds – is a very simple exercise to kind of warm things up a little bit and to 
get an experience of trying different mental processes as a contrast. This 
makes it easier to understand the contrast of what’s going on then.  
 
I’d like you to choose very quickly someone who’s sitting next to you who’s 
going to be your partner for the next few rounds, and just stay with that 
partner because it really doesn’t matter. They could be a stone platform. As 
long as you think they’re a human being, it will work. 
 
If you want to do all of this in the privacy of your own mind – especially you at 
home who don’t have anyone that you can practice with, you can do it all in 
the privacy of your mind – what I’d like you to do is pretend or imagine that 
you’re going to explain or describe things that I’m going to ask you to explain 
or describe in a moment’s time to someone else. 
 
Think about being on the phone. You can either whisper it out loud if you 
want or you can do this on the bus. Just use your internal dialog, otherwise 
people will start shifting around you and giving you lots of leg room. So, you 
have a choice. I really don’t care which way you do it. 
 
You can either do it in the privacy of your own mind, but I want you to use 
internal dialog to describe things as though someone were present. You can 
whisper it out loud if you just want to do it on your own, or you can just turn 
to the person next to you and talk to them like you’re having a normal 
conversation.  
 
Has anyone here ever just talked to a friend about a holiday, a house or 
somewhere they’ve been? It’s just a natural thing that we do every day. Just 
very quickly make eye contact with someone who will be your partner for the 
exercise and then turn this way again.

Here’s the exercise. It’s very simple. What I want you to do right now in the 
privacy of your own mind is close your eyes and I want you to think about the 
room you’re very familiar with – your bedroom, the kitchen, the living room, 
office, a room you’re very familiar with.  
 
Think about that room and just note it – here’s where the computer is, here’s 
where the bed is, here’s where the couch is, here’s where the chair is or 
whatever. Just do a mental tour around that little room just to see how clear 
or stable that mentalization is. 
 
Now bring yourselves back. Put your hands up if that was easy just thinking 
about the room. You’re all pretty sure that those things are where you said 
they would be, right? The chair is where you think it’s going to be and the 
table is where it’s going to be and so on. 
 
Now I want you to compare and contrast that to a room you’re less familiar 
with, whether it’s in your house or someone else’s house. I want you to close 
your eyes again and just think about a different room that you’re not so 
familiar with, and just notice the qualities of that. Just think about that other 
room. 
 
Come on back. Let me ask you this? Was there a difference in terms of the 
two different rooms you were thinking about? Put your hands up if there was 
a difference. Let’s just get the whole group together on this.  
 
Now let me make a few guesses and then you can share your experience with 
me. Would it be fair to say that the second room was more difficult to keep a 
grasp of in your mind? Would it be fair to say that the objects in the second 
room were less stable – in other words they’d be here one moment and 
they’d be here another moment and they’d be here another moment? Would 
that be fair to say? 
 
Sometimes they’ll be a little bit more hazy and less easy to kind of identify. 
There’s kind of something there but I’m not sure what it is? Would that also 
be fair to say?  
 
If you compared that to your original room, that was a lot easier, crisper, 
clearer and surer, so there’s more certainty and stability in the room you’re 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

familiar with and there’s more uncertainty and instability in the room you’re 
less familiar with. Would that be a safe summary of your experiences? 
 
Is there anything else you want to say about that experience so far? 
Otherwise, I’ll just move onto the next exercise. 
 
Student: I had a really good visual memory. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I could not get to a place I couldn’t remember. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful. In that case you’re ahead of the program. We’re not looking 
for failure. The only reason for using that is to explain where failure comes 
from. You’ll probably find a number of exercises that we’ll do today a little 
less challenging because you’re already there. I’m helping everyone else 
develop what you’ve already got. So, just bear with us. It will still be useful to 
you and there will still be a nice learning point. Rest assured by tomorrow, it 
will start going AWOL for you too. 
 
 
Now we have a baseline reading. We have a room that we’re familiar with and 
a room that we’re less familiar with. We know that one is more sure and 
stable and the other one is less certain and less stable. Everyone is different. 
We have for example a person who’s blind and may I just double check with 
you? You also, Werner, could conceive or think about both rooms and one 
had more stability than the other. Is that correct? 
 
Werner: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. So, notice how visual sightedness is irrelevant. It’s got nothing to 
do with your vision. You may see it and you may not. I don’t care about how 
you do it. We’re calling it mentalization for a reason. You just need to 
conceive it. You don’t have to actually see it. That distinction will clarify as we 
go along.  
 
 
Now with your partner we’ll do two things. With your eyes open, I want you 
to just first of all describe the room you’re familiar with. Then close your eyes 
and without describing it, just mentalize it again and see what difference that 
makes.

Then I want you to do the same thing with the room you’re less familiar with. 
Describe it out loud to your partner and then close your eyes again afterwards 
and mentalize it, and see what difference that makes and then compare the 
two experiences to the ones you just had just now. Do you understand the 
nature of this exercise? Are there any questions? All right, it’s a relatively 
quick exercise, so just turn to your partners and off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I should describe the room. It’s a friend’s kitchen that I spent a lot of time 
in during this summer. There’s a small table, only two chairs. There’s a stove 
and the fridge and the freezer and a cupboard. There’s a sink and a checkered 
floor. 
 
Student: Now mentalize. 
 
Student: Do you want me to describe it to you? 
 
Student: No, it’s just your experience. 
 
Student: The other part was the unfamiliar room. Describe that room that’s less 
familiar. 
 
Student: It’s a room I was in a couple of weekends ago at another friend’s house. I’d 
only been there once. There’s a sofa, a stereo. It’s a living room, a dinner 
table and some book shelves. That’s about what I remember.  
 
 
So, I’m going to mentalize it now. Interesting. New details. I forgot about the 
balcony when I described the not-so-familiar room. I forgot the door to the 
balcony but while mentalizing it, a lot of details came out, a lot of details. 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How was that? Was that interesting? Let’s get a mic ready 
please. Let me just ask you, what did you notice between the first attempt at 
mentalizing the same rooms, and your second attempt at mentalizing the 
same rooms having warmed up with something else first? 
 
Student: I had the same problem in Toronto. I have the tendency to once I’ve seen 
something it remains with me. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent.

Student: The right-hand side of my brain feeds it to me, but I did notice the difference 
between eyes open and eyes closed. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: The fact that the eyes open you’re having a conflict between the right and the 
left-hand side of the brain and you’re picturing things, but when you close 
your eyes you just get a direct feed from the source. 
 
Igor: 
So, whether or not it’s the left brain or right brain is a debatable thing. That’s 
not the important part. The point is overall would it be fair to say that with 
your eyes closed, your mentalization becomes easier and more stable than 
with your eyes open? Is that correct? Was that everyone’s experience? That’s 
wonderful. 
 
 You found your first rule for stabilizing your attention internally. By 
closing your eyes, although the left and right brain may have 
something to do with it, one of the bigger reasons for it though has to 
do with your occipital lobe. 
 
 
If you just put your hand in the back of your head right there, that’s roughly 
your occipital lobe. That’s probably one of the largest processes inside of your 
brain. It’s vastly larger than the area that processes auditory or kinesthetic 
information and so on, so your visual process is incredibly fast. 
 
 
Even if you’re blind, that area gets used for other things. So, one of the 
reasons we’re using primarily the visual process – although it’s not exclusively 
the visual one – is speed of processing. It’s just a better computer. By closing 
your eyes, there is less input. There’s less interference and less stuff that 
computer needs to do, which means you have more freedom to do other 
things.  
 
 
When you get good at this – for example now I can do this sitting in a 
restaurant waiting for the waiter, and if you’re in South America you know 
that that’s a long time. So, I will tend to stare off in the distance as if I’m lost 
in thought – which I am – only they have no idea what I’m seeing and it’s 
good.

So, the first rule to stabilize your experiences is initially you’ll close your eyes. 
In time eyes opened or closed will be irrelevant. All these stabilizers are like 
training wheels on the back of a bike. They’re only there to help you along to 
start with. Eventually they can all be discarded.  
 
 
Now let’s turn to the second portion of it, which is the description. Who 
noticed there was a difference when they described the rooms than when 
they just tried to mentalize them without descriptions silently? Put your 
hands up. Who wants to talk a little bit about that? 
 
Student: When I was trying to describe the room where I was unfamiliar with, my brain 
was kind of filling in details. Just describing the hostel where I’m staying and I 
saw it in dark for five minutes last night. I knew there was a big wall on the 
left but I couldn’t tell if there was a mirror on it. 
 
Igor: 
Which is fine. We’ll come onto the filling in details in a moment, but for now 
let’s say the general rule is as you’re describing it the very things you found 
difficult when mentalizing it quietly became easier. Would that be fair to say? 
In other words, the haziness became less hazy. There’s still some haziness, I 
know, but it became less hazy. 
 
 
The stability increased. You were more certain. Let me ask you this. When you 
closed your eyes and mentalized it after having described it, was it easier or 
the same as when you did it earlier on out here without any speech at all? 
 
Student: When I had my eyes closed, it felt like I was kind of floating around the room, 
flying around it. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect, but overall it was easier for you to be aware of that room in your 
mental environment after having described it than when you just did it on 
your own earlier on without any warm-up, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Would that be kind of roughly matching your experiences overall?  
 
 We have a second rule for how to stabilize our internal environment, 
which is describing it.

Now this is going to get more sophisticated. I’m not sure if we’ll get onto it in 
this course or if we have to wait for an advanced course, but this idea of using 
language to stabilize things is very, very important.  
 
In the old world, they used to say things like naming a thing has power over it. 
Has anyone heard that sort of idea before – that name gives you a power over 
a thing?  
 
The act of naming uses part of your neurology, which is different from the one 
that we use when we’re mentalizing things. More of your brain is adding in 
information than you would otherwise have. So, the act of describing it helps 
you stabilize and become more certain with the internal environment.  
 
Again, these are training wheels. There will come a point – and you’ll discover 
it for yourself – when describing it will interfere. It will slow you down 
essentially, but that’s when you become very good at it. Until you’re at that 
point, describing it will stabilize and make it clearer for you, which will make 
the whole process easier for you. 
 
If you describe it to an actual person, more of your brain gets engaged than 
when you’re describing it to yourself. When you’re describing it out loud, 
more of your brain gets engaged than when you’re just thinking about it. 
When you’re using internal dialog, more of your brain gets engaged than 
when you’re just mentalizing it without that. 
 
So, the more brain you engage, the easier the task becomes. Do you 
understand the concept?  
 
1. As a rule going forward, we have when we’re doing any kind of mental 
practice, we’re going to close our eyes to increase our processing 
power. 
 
2. We’re going to describe it out loud preferably or we’re using our 
internal dialog if we don’t want to seem nuts in the bar, and that’s 
going to help us stabilize it.

Pantomimed Mentalization 
 
Igor: 
There’s a third thing I want you to be able to do, and I want you to 
experiment with that right now. With your partner, we’re going to do exactly 
the same exercise again, only this time rather than describing it out loud first, 
what I want you to do is do both the familiar room and less familiar room – 
although the less familiar room should elevate a little bit right now. 
 
 
Then I want you to describe here’s my bed and so on. Imagine that the person 
you’re talking to is actually with you in the room. Here’s my bed. Do you like 
the flowers on it? Do you get the idea?  
 
 
In fact let me just give you a quick demonstration of what I mean. I’m going to 
be in the kitchen right now. So, we’re standing in the kitchen, we’re facing the 
fridge, it’s black, it’s a large fridge with two double doors. As you open it up, 
you have the meat drawer over here, we have the two vegetable drawers 
right there, and there are one, two, three stacks going up here, so we have 
milk in a jug container there. We have orange juice next to it.  
 
 
Do you see what I’m doing right now? You are there kind of with me, and I’m 
kind of imagining you’re there and saying do you see that here, do you see 
this here? I’m pointing out the features.  
 
 
You’ll do that with the room that you’re familiar with first of all. Then I want 
you to do that with the room that you’re less familiar with so that you can 
compare and contrast two things: 
 
1. Familiar versus unfamiliar. 
2. This exercise compared to the other exercises. 
 
The extra thing I want you to do – and you may have seen me doing it. I don’t 
know if I did it consciously or not. If not, I’ll do it again properly – which is I 
want you to pantomime. Here’s the fridge. If you open the doors, over here 
we have a little drawer. There’s a milk jug there with the orange juice there. 
There are a couple of drawers above that. 
 
Do you see how I’m actually pantomiming the whole thing like you’re 
physically there? That pantomiming will do something and I want you to 
experience what that something is. Do you all understand the nature of this 
exercise? Once again, it’s identical.

We’re just adding the pantomime and we’re going to straight to the eyes 
closed version for both just so we have a contrasting experience. All right, 
turn to your partners and off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: All right, so we’re back in the familiar kitchen. The entrance to the kitchen, 
the door is just behind me or us, and when we enter the kitchen there’s a sink 
and cupboards both below and above, and there’s the dishwasher at the end 
just next to the sink, and on the right-hand side is the combo fridge and 
freezer with the stove next to it, and in between it’s the coffee maker and as 
we go deeper into the kitchen, it’s the kitchen table and a children’s chair and 
a regular chair, and something that would be called a sofa I guess.  
 
 
Beyond the stove there’s a big bench and a work area for the kitchen and 
above that are three shelves of glass with random stuff that has been tucked 
away there. The cupboards above the sink and next to the stove are wide and 
have three shelves in them where all the plates and glass and all that stuff is. 
 
Student: Let me pause you there. Visualize for a second.  
 
Student: Describe it? 
 
Student: Describe it. Pantomime it. Activate your visual cortex. 
 
Student: Yes. So yet again the entrance to the room is behind us. There’s a dining table 
to the left and behind that bookshelves, three or four maybe, packed with 
books. On our right-hand side there’s a stereo and it’s not tidy, and then 
there’s a chair and a sofa and a living room table in between, and the balcony 
door is beyond that outside the balcony. 
 
Student: Just mentalize that. 
 
Student: While mentalizing it, there’s furniture that I didn’t remember the first time 
around that appeared, furniture that I can’t really – I know they’re there but I 
can’t really figure out what it is.

Igor: 
How did that go? Was that fun? Was that interesting? Who’s starting to learn 
a little bit about their minds already, about how your mind operates? Put your 
hands up.  
 
 
What kind of experiences did you have during that last exercise? What have 
you learned from it and importantly about stabilizing what’s going on inside 
your mind? 
 
Student: The difference between before and this time was that by using the gestures, 
you’re actually living it, which gives you that feeling that you’re there; you’re 
doing it right now. 
 
Igor: 
It sucks you much more into the experience rather than being kind of 
disconnected, dissociated from it. Would you all be in general agreement that 
pantomiming it brings it more to life for you? Who found that the images 
were more vivid as a result?  
 
 
Who found that they started having feelings about things? Maybe they could 
almost feel what touching something in that room would feel like. Who found 
that the room that was less familiar started suddenly becoming a lot easier to 
do, especially compared to the very first time you mentalized it? 
 
 
Do you know the old saying practice makes perfect? Those of you who have 
worked with me before will understand of course that that is an incorrect 
saying. It’s correct practice makes perfect, because practice just makes 
permanent.  
 
 
One of the troubles I’ve seen with the classic way that things like 
visualizations are taught and so on is it’s just done by sheer dumb persistence. 
You just keep doing it until it works.  
 
 
The problem is what else are you practicing at the same time? What are you 
making permanent? Frustration, instability, self-doubt? Do you see why some 
people take years to get to that point and even then they have to undo all the 
bad stuff they did at the beginning, and most people just give up because it’s 
just too much effort. 
 
 
Even though we have no real content yet, we’re not really working with 
content, we’re just learning with the general structure of what we’re doing,

who’s finding it’s actually quite satisfying having a mentalization like this? 
Good. Are there any other questions or comments on what we’ve done? 
 
Student: I just wanted to ask about something you said earlier. When you’re in the 
restaurant and just visualizing, is that a trance state? 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for asking that. I want to make some distinctions here. We’ve 
looked at three stabilizers that are easy. These are everyday activities that we 
do, aren’t they?  
 
 
When you talk to people, don’t most people gesture even though some 
people gesture a little like this and some people are like this, but most people 
tend to gesture? 
 
 
When you’re actually doing things in the real world, we’re actually moving our 
bodies. When we talk, we’re doing another thing. So, here’s a rule of thumb. 
We’re using our external reality to teach our internal reality what we need of 
it because we don’t really understand either.  
 
 
Our perceptual mechanisms are designed to work well with a certain reality 
because this is stable. We have the same input. If I look at that mirror and I 
look away and then look back, it stays the same. So, I have learned, my brain 
has learned over time to trust my vision in a certain way, and I’m going to use 
that as a metaphor for my unconscious mind to do the same thing internally 
so that these wispy dream images that just float away don’t float away 
anymore when I need them to stay stable. They can float all they want when I 
don’t care about them. 
 
 
That’s kind of a preamble to answering your question. There will be other 
things that stabilize your internal attention. Altered states of consciousness 
will be one of them for example. Relaxation will be another. Focus will be a 
third. Why have I not added them to this list? Do you have any ideas? 
 
Student: They come in later. 
 
Igor: 
They can come in later and you’re welcome to add them in later, but the 
reason I haven’t added them is because you live your life every day doing 
these three things.

You close your eyes every night when you go to sleep and it’s an easy thing to 
do. You talk to people about your experiences constantly. You move your 
body through the world and so your mind understands all these things.  
 
 
How many people in day-to-day life physically relax on purpose? Not many 
people do. It’s a very good habit to have but let’s face it, if you’re not in the 
habit of doing that, then why use relaxation to stabilize your internal 
experiences if you’re no good at the relaxation part in the first place?  
 
 
If you’re trying to do both relaxation and visualizations at the same time, 
you’re doing two tasks that are both unfamiliar to you. So, you’re welcome to 
add relaxation into that process. It will help but I’m not teaching it that way 
because I want you to use what you’re good at already. 
 
 
Now let’s talk about the idea of trance state and let’s expand the concept to 
the idea of altered states of consciousness in general. If it’s true, if certain 
portions of your mind switch the way they operate – you’re all familiar with 
the idea of brainwave frequencies.  
 
 
A very brief overview is when your brain works in modes it will have an 
electronic signature that can be measured. These have very crudely been 
divided into beta, alpha, delta, theta and then the gamma was the new one 
they just recently added to it, and each one has been subdivided into SMR 
and all kinds of different things. 
 
 
Now this whole field is actually very complex and it’s made more complex 
when you realize that the brainwave frequencies that your brain is operating 
on is not universal. In other words, your frontal lobe can be operating on an 
alpha whereas your rear lobe might be more in delta or theta at the same 
time, and you have your hemispheric divisions as well. It’s very complicated.  
 
 
Then knowing which part of your brain to put into alpha and which one into 
delta and which one into theta so that it all works out perfectly is even more 
complex without a machine telling you you’re doing it. 
 
 
It gets even harder to know you’re actually doing it. Am I there? I don’t know. 
So, most people who think about am I in an altered state of consciousness to 
do this work spend so much time worrying about am I in the right place that 
they don’t do any work. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
38 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, we’ve removed all that. What we’re going to do instead is - the brain’s 
actually a very smart device. It will naturally optimize for the task that you’re 
doing. In other words, if you’re doing a task that is best served in an alpha 
state your brain will naturally slip into the alpha state whilst doing that task, 
and the same is true of the other states of consciousness also. 
 
 
So, instead of worrying about what state of mind are you in, you just do the 
exercise and in doing the exercise your brain will naturally over time switch 
into the optimal way of doing it because it saves energy. It’s called implicit 
learning.  
 
 
It just learns to do it naturally and hence becomes easier, which means that 
over time just doing these exercises you’re more likely to just feel more 
relaxed because that comes as a byproduct of the alpha state, but it’s a side 
effect rather than the cause. 
 
 
If you look for it for a cause, it can be very frustrating because when you need 
it most, it won’t be there. When you’re stressed and you really need to be 
there – relax, relax, okay, I’m relaxing. I can’t see anything. Damn it. It’s not 
working. 
 
 
I’m over-emphasizing it for a point. If you want it to be there for you, you 
train it every single day and it will be there for you when you need it. Most 
people don’t do that, so why not use things that you do every single day that 
you have full control of because it’s part of your normal socializing activities, 
which will have a very similar impact and through the back door all these 
other things will occur also? Does that make sense? Thank you, great 
question. 
 
Arthur: 
I found that when I was trying to describe the room that I was familiar with, it 
wasn’t hard but I know so much about it that I was only able to describe a few 
details. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Let me extrapolate from that. So, you’re going to spend an hour 
talking about that one room because you know it so intimately, versus the 
other room where you kind of run out after maybe five or 10 minutes. That’s 
perfect. 
 
 
You see, you’ve just demonstrated the exact reason why we close our eyes 
because your occipital lobe – your visual processing units – are so much faster 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

than your linguistic units. It will take you an hour to catch up to what you’re 
seeing, and ultimately the place that we’ll want to be at is where you intend 
something and it happens.  
 
 
You want a certain mental environment to occur, and you want certain things 
to occur within that environment, and they just occur naturally. These are just 
stabilizing factors, shall we say. It’s quite fine to not describe everything that 
you’re actually experiencing because you don’t have the time for it. 
 
Arthur: 
Right because I was feeling incomplete, unsatisfied describing the familiar 
room. 
 
Igor: 
It’s because you’re a perfectionist and you want to do it exactly to the letter – 
I’m describing every single item and the first book has 366 pages in it and an 
index. At this point we’re looking for more general things. In time that will 
serve you, but at this point we’re just going for the general approach, so well 
done for doing the task much better than is necessary. 
 
Student: An interesting phenomenon occurred. If I look at you and I’m focused on you 
and I’ve got the peripheral vision of the room, with super imposed peripheral 
vision I can see the whole room. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent, so you’re now going to the next step. If I were to do this in a 
restaurant, I wouldn’t be very well fed. They’re going to say what the hell is 
wrong with him? Security? 
 
 
If you see me doing this in public, all you’ll see is me doing this. Now I can lose 
myself in that mentalization as completely as with my eyes closed; only I 
won’t get arrested. So, what you’re experiencing is that process beginning to 
happen. As you open your eyes up, your mind is naturally super-imposing 
your mentalization on the external environment. 
 
 
One of the people I took through the beta group with this used to have a real 
difficulty experiencing Deep Trance Phenomena. He can now negatively 
hallucinate the whole world with his eyes wide open.  
 
 
He sees nothing out here and he’s fully immersed in the mental experiences 
he’s having as though he’s actually experiencing it, and importantly he knows 
that he’s currently having what a psychologist might call a psychotic break, 
but he has control over it.

In other words, he can dispel it and come back to this reality and go oh yeah I 
don’t really care about this, and then shut it down again and go back out 
again, but he’s had a lot of practice with that now.  
 
 
You’re beginning to experience that part of the process, but right now we’re 
still working with training wheels, which is why eyes closed is more useful to 
you but it’s good to know that your mind is already naturally beginning to 
adapt it so that you can do it in any kind of different format. Does that make 
sense? 
 
 
Does everything we’ve been talking about so far match your experiences? 
This is very important to me because if it doesn’t, I need to know so that I can 
help you take that step.  
 
 
Normally, I’d be coaching this one on one, but as a group I need to know what 
your mind is doing so that I can help make sure that you’re getting the main 
portion of the lesson out of this. Are there any other comments or questions 
before we have a break? 
 
Student: My question is it seems to me like with pictures and sounds and movements 
and everything just kind of interfaces between the subconscious, because 
when I was an engineer, for example, sometimes I knew the solution for a 
project but I was not yet able to really put it in words and pictures and 
everything. 
 
Igor: 
This will help make that transition. 
 
Student: Do we really need this? 
 
Igor: 
Let me address this later on in the week, but this is perfect. No is the answer 
to that. You do not need any of what we’re doing. What we’re doing right 
now are two things.  
 
1. We’re creating a shared vocabulary so that when I ask you to do a 
certain task you understand what I mean by it. The only way I can do it 
is for us to have shared experiences so we know we’re referring to the 
same thing.

2. I’m helping you create that interface so you can understand your 
unconscious mind better and have that interaction for those times 
when you don’t have that particular answer.  
 
Now in time where this will take you is where you have just one thing – you 
intend it and it happens. That’s it. That’s the magic, folks. Everything else is 
the Shaman rattling his rattle and banging his drum and doing things.  
 
These are all things to assist you when you can’t do that for yourself, but 
ultimately you’ll get to the point where you think I’m having a problem with 
this, gone, done; or I want to achieve this, sort it out. But most of us do not 
have that kind of relationship with our own inner environment, our 
unconscious mind, that we can do that. Would that be fair to say? 
 
If you did have that kind of relationship with your unconscious mind for all the 
things that are important to you, then I suspect you wouldn’t have bothered 
coming here. You say why would I bother coming to this? I can already do this. 
I can do better than that. 
 
So, this is an interface so that you can learn to do that, but ultimately you’ll be 
exactly at that point where you’ll say I just know, or I just do, or it just 
happened.  
 
Look at it at a slightly different perspective here. As you know I’m a hypnotist 
and Conversational Hypnosis is my big thing. I noticed that the times when I’m 
most successful with it is when for example I go into a meeting which is 
important and I need to achieve certain things. I have the intention. I have 
conviction.  
 
It’s very difficult to talk about this right now because we haven’t gotten to the 
intention part of the training yet; hence, you’ll have some misalignment about 
understanding but hopefully it will correct itself over the week. I just intend. I 
want this kind of outcome. I don’t care how it happens and I don’t think about 
it because I’m too busy talking to the other person. I’m not going okay, I’m 
going to use this phrase and I missed it. Where’s everyone gone? 
 
It just kind of comes out of me, which is exactly the same thing that you 
should be doing with your things. For example, let’s say someone has a 
phobia of heights.

You’re in the middle of a bridge and you say I’m a little bit afraid. I don’t think 
I want that anymore and conscious mind – thank you, off you go – but to get 
to that point you need a period of the interface so that you can have a 
relationship with yourself so you understand that when you intend it, it 
actually happens. 
 
It goes both ways. If you don’t really intend it, it shouldn’t actually happen 
either. Has anyone here ever had a revenge fantasy, where inside your mind 
you rip the beating heart out of the parking traffic warden and feed it into the 
mouth and say that’s what I think of your ticket? 
 
If you were to follow up on a revenge fantasy as though it were a genuine 
intention, then I would probably be visiting you in prison shortly before the 
needle comes in.  
 
The whole point of doing this process is so that you get to develop the kind of 
relationship you need with your own internal consciousness to achieve 
everything you want and in particular this is the main purpose of this course.  
 
You can get out of Bucket Land because you’ve been there long enough – or 
at least you can fix all the things in Bucket Land so then you can get out of it 
afterwards, but until then we need more and more stabilizing factors until you 
learn to trust that instinct, that intuition, that instant idea shall we say. Does 
that help? 
 
Student: I was trying to explain the scene and he was just imagine it very positive and 
this thing happened to me when he was describing it and that is not one time. 
It was three times. 
 
Igor: 
So, in other words when they’re describing their experience to you, you have 
a parallel but more fuzzy version of their experience? 
 
Student: Exactly. I tried so hard to understand every little detail. 
 
Igor: 
Don’t worry about understanding them. That’s not your purpose. The only 
reason for you to actual listen to someone talking out loud is so they feel less 
weird talking out loud to have someone actually listen to them, and secondly 
because when they know that someone’s listening, more of their brain gets 
activated. It’s just one of those neurological quirks that we have, so you’re 
helping them activate more of their brain.

They don’t actually need to talk to you at all. You don’t need to know anything 
about what’s going on inside their mind because after all this is all about you. 
You’re not training to be a hypnotherapist right now, so the fact that you’re 
already getting a hazy sense of what they’re talking about is just a very natural 
part of what language is about.  
 
 
That’s the point of having language. It’s so that I can share my internal 
experience with you, and if we can have that haziness be close enough then 
you’ll know what I’m trying to ask you to do. That’s the point of language.  
 
 
If you weren’t having a sense of what he was talking about, you’d be 
incapable of understanding him. Does that make sense? Thank you for that. 
Are there any other comments or questions? 
 
Student: I’ve heard a repeating theme you have of practice makes perfect… 
 
Igor: 
Permanent. 
 
Student: Permanent, yes. Maybe that’s the problem. Part of my whole structure with a 
lot of my life is that I have a habit of doing things for a while and then off they 
go. Is there a way to get it to where I get enough… 
 
Igor: 
We’re jumping ahead. There are a couple of things there. First of all, we’re 
now going to the practical part of this course, which will be the latter part. 
Right now we’re setting things up, so it’s a good question but we’re not there 
yet. 
 
 
Number two, you may have noticed that a lot of things that we’re doing are 
things you do every day anyway. Does anyone here talk to people? Does 
anyone ever move their physical body through space somehow? Not outer 
space, just space. Does everyone here close your eyes and open them from 
time to time?  
 
 
These are things you’re very capable of. Adding this extra little nuance is 
something very simple. You’ll have enough practice in here of doing that to 
begin to form some habits, some habituation patterns.

After that, then we get onto the actual practical parts of this, but before we 
get to the practical parts we’ve got to have some foundations to work with on 
that.  
 
 
Let’s take a break.

DVD 2 – How To Switch Off Fear, 
Mindfulness & Integration Breathing 
 
 
Mindfulness & Neuroscience 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back everyone. If you’re not back in the room, please raise your 
hand so I know not to continue yet. Did you have fun with that? Did you enjoy 
the exercise we did before the break? 
 
 
What we’ve been doing so far in terms of the mental exercises – we’ll call 
these mentalizations – that’s the bit where you get to fly. That’s where you 
get to explore, discover things about your inner landscape and get archetypal 
forces to emerge and the symbolic landscape you’ll be creating in due course 
and have some very powerful, healing and transformative experiences. 
 
 
But they have to go hand in hand with the grounding practices, the things that 
will keep you, for want of a better word, sane. You’ll need a balancing point so 
that you don’t get too lost in your own mental processes and ultimately have 
to come back to something practical and something useful. 
 
 
Very importantly, part of those grounding practices will be the safety valves 
that make sure that wherever you go inside your mind will be safe so that 
even if it’s a troubling thing – let’s say you want to resolve some kind of 
conflict from your past or an unpleasant thing that happened to you. 
 
 
If you want to free yourself from that at some level, you may have to end up 
facing it and you’ll need safety mechanisms to be able to do that and be 
absolutely certain that it’s going to happen in a healthy way rather than 
unhealthy ways, one we already mentioned at the start of the course. Do you 
understand what I mean by this?  
 
 
Now luckily there’s a roughly 3,000-year-old practice that has already excelled 
in this. Has anyone here heard of mindfulness? It’s of course one of the key 
Buddhist practices.

We need to talk a little bit about meditation, what it is and what isn’t and so 
on to be able to fit it into this method and understand the purpose of it within 
this method.  
 
 
The purpose is not the same as in Buddhism, for enlightenment and so on, 
although of course you can probably reach those areas in a similar way by 
doing the same practices. 
 
 
Primarily the reason for it is in order to get those big moments you have to do 
a lot of it. We’re talking about days of meditation, hours of it and intense 
focus and most of us don’t have that kind of time in our lives to do it. What 
we’re going to end up doing is stuff that takes you five or 10 minutes but it 
adds up because you’re doing it constantly.  
 
 
It becomes as natural to you as making sure you wear pants before you leave 
the house – or a skirt if you’re a woman or a man who likes to wear skirts. So, 
we’re going to use it for a slightly different purpose, but the reason it’s very 
useful is because mindfulness has a lot of research behind it. 
 
 
Essentially when you come to the Eastern meditation practices, you have two 
essential different types: 
 
1. The mindfulness or inside meditations. 
2. The concentration meditations. 
 
 
Most people tend to be attracted to the concentration meditations where you 
maybe look at a candle flame and just focus on that and focus on it intensely 
and build it up inside your mind and so on.  
 
 
Has anyone heard of Kim’s Game? I think Kipling wrote a book on that, where 
you look at objects and then you close your eyes and you intensely try to 
visual all the objects and so on. 
 
 
 
These require a lot of concentration, levels of concentration that most of us 
do not have. We can build up those levels of concentration, absolutely, but 
there’s a problem with that style of meditation. It’s the flight.  
 
 
It’s very intense. It gets all the weird phenomenon people want where they 
feel like they’re translocating, where they lose touch with their reality and 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
47 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
showers of stars come and hit them and they feel intense emotions and all 
kinds of stuff.  
 
 
Very intense experiences can be achieved relatively quickly if you have the 
wherewithal to stick through very arduous concentration practices, but they 
also have a tendency to detach people a little bit from reality. 
 
 
This is something that in meditation circles is not much talked of but there is a 
little bit of research on it. It’s very important research for our purposes here, 
and that is meditation-triggered psychosis. Because we have two different 
styles of meditation – one which is fast and hard and one which is slow but 
steady – most people go for the fast and hard route because they can do it. 
 
 
Unfortunately, a lot of the people that get attracted to the fast and hard route 
are the ones that have the bigger issues because they want to resolve them 
more quickly, so there’s a risk that they will detach from everyday reality, lose 
themselves in these concentration meditations and go to places where in 
traditional parlance they are mad because what they’re experiencing is totally 
disconnected from what the rest of the world is experiencing, and that’s not a 
very useful place to be in unless you’re doing it on purpose in a time-limited 
environment. 
 
 
Do you understand where I’m going with this? Again there is very little written 
on this but I did come across one Ph.D. who did a study on meditation-
triggered psychosis, and in particular how different meditation groups deal 
with it. Dealing with it, believe it or not, is through mindfulness. It’s more 
grounding. 
 
 
So, if someone is a little psychotic and a little nuts – to use a technical term – 
the more experienced meditation teachers will take one look and say no, this 
is not your practice, you go to this group and that’s going to be better for you; 
and once they see the signs that they’re more stable, then they can join the 
more intense group again. Do you see where I’m going with this?  
 
 
Now as it happens, mindfulness is also the most researched of all the mental 
practices. Psychoanalysis has no research behind it. It’s a lot of very 
interesting ideas, some of which kind of bear out in reality and some of which 
are just figments of someone else’s psychosis.

There are many psychotherapeutic practices that have more to do with a pet 
theory that someone has than with actual neurological stuff. By the way, I 
include with this hypnosis.  
 
 
As much as I love hypnosis and as many wonderful results as I’ve achieved 
with it, those results are purely anecdotal. They haven’t been researched in 
the more stringent scientific methods sense. Does that make sense to you?  
 
 
It’s important that you understand that. Just because something hasn’t been 
researched doesn’t make it valuable. It just means that you’re more prone to 
errors, which means your conclusions should be a bit more cautious than stuff 
that’s been researched more fully, if you get what I mean here. 
 
 
Let’s get back to the idea of mindfulness. This has been researched intensely, 
especially over the last 10 years. The reason I think it’s particularly interesting 
is because that research is both pragmatic research in terms of people who 
meditate are like this before, and after a certain period of time of doing these 
exercises they’re like this now.  
 
 
So, it’s a very strong correlation and by having other groups that aren’t 
meditating in that particular way who don’t have those same results, you can 
quite confidently ascribe the changes to the meditation practice. Do you 
understand? 
 
 
The other reason it’s important is because we actually have much better 
technology for actually seeing what’s going on inside the brain. PET scans, f-
MRI scans and so on tell you what’s going on inside, and that tells us that 
mindfulness meditation alters the actual architecture of the brain.  
 
 
If you look at the highways of the brain, the neurons connecting to each other 
and so on and you look at someone who’s done a lot of meditation, it will look 
different. 
 
 
Now here’s the bit that’s most interesting to us. Let’s talk a little bit about 
your brain just so you’ll understand why we’re doing some things. If you take 
your right or left hand – whichever you’re more comfortable with because 
you’ll be touching yourself right about there – place it on your forehead and 
let the hand wrap around.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

The area that your hand is covering, especially if it’s kind of open a little bit, is 
known as not the skull, but if you were to touch your brain directly – which 
would be unpleasant but it would be interesting – that’s called the frontal 
lobe or the frontal cortex. That’s the bit that makes you human. 
 
If you just hold your forehead now, this is called your prefrontal cortex. There 
are a whole bunch of different areas inside of here, and these areas are of 
particular interest to us. Within these areas, when these have been developed 
properly, you end up having various psychological benefits.  
 
They’re responsible for certain psychological traits, shall we say, that if you 
asked pretty much most psychologists in the world, they would agree that 
those are signs of a healthy stable mind.  
 
If you asked most everyday people and you translate that into everyday 
parlance, they would say yes that would be a person that is a good stable 
healthy person, mentally speaking. There are a number of functions that the 
prefrontal cortex runs.  
 
The one we’re particularly interested in right now, although we’re interested 
in several of them, but the one which is most important for the practice we’re 
going to do is these fibers called GABA fibers. Those of you who want to have 
the long version of it, it’s Gamma Aminobutyric Acid, and they link your 
prefrontal cortex directly to the limbic system. 
 
The limbic system is your mammalian brain, your more instinctual brain. It’s 
where your emotions are generated and things like that. The GABA fibers are 
interesting because the switch off fear. The stronger the GABA fibers, the 
larger the bundle of fibers becomes, the more easily you can cope with fear 
and frightening situations. 
 
Are you beginning to have a sense that developing this part of your brain will 
be particularly crucial to us if we wish to take flight into the more nether 
regions of our own minds?  
 
Another function of the prefrontal cortex which is going to be of great 
importance to us is they regulate our emotions. In other words, they keep 
them balanced.

Not too intense – which means basically you become an emotional wreck and 
wreck people’s lives around you at the same time because you can’t control 
your behavior, so your emotions end up overriding your frontal lobe, which 
means that you have no more control over your behavior. 
 
If you have too little emotion, your life becomes pretty sucky for starters and 
your decision-making gets worse. There’s actually a little bit of research that 
shows that when people completely alienate their emotions from their 
decision-making process, their ability to make good decisions totally gets 
destroyed, so we need our emotional health in order to make good balanced 
decisions, which is very important when you’re working with yourself. 
 
I’m a bit of a sci-fi fan. Does anyone here know of an old 1960’s movie called 
the Forbidden Planet? It’s an old classic. For those of you who are not familiar 
with it, here’s a spoiler alert.  
 
Essentially a spaceship lands on distant planet. There was a little colony there 
and everyone’s dead except for a scientist and his daughter and there’s a big 
mystery around it. 
 
As soon as they land, the area starts getting attacked by some invisible beast 
that no one can see, but who for some reason leaves the scientist and his 
daughter alone but he’s killed off everyone else and he’s now trying to kill off 
the crew of this place as well, so that’s the mystery. 
 
The mystery gets resolved at the end when the ship’s doctor breaks into some 
alien laboratory and puts on this weird mind device that boosts his 
intelligence through the roof, so much so that his brain can’t cope and he 
dies. 
 
The mystery is this. Where did that monster come from? All this is contained – 
and this is Freudian language – in what the doctor called monsters from the 
Id. The Id is the English Freudian version of the unpleasant parts of the 
unconscious mind. 
 
I think it’s got some accuracy to it but it’s inaccurate as a complete model, but 
this is very interesting. You see, what the doctor discovered was that as soon 
as his brain power gets boosted and he’s able to manifest all these weird 
things in the environment, the machines that basically turn their thoughts 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

into a reality, it’s not just your good thoughts that get amplified. It’s all the 
bad ones too. 
 
Now the stray little thought like oh, I could punch them, just becomes an 
obsession. It’s not necessarily the best way to live your life, is it? Now when 
you look in the mirror and say oh is that a blemish, it could be life-destroying 
instead of oh, it will go away later on. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
I won’t ask you to put your hands up on this one because you’re on record, 
but if anyone here has ever experimented with psychedelic – well, people call 
them drugs but we’ll call them entheogens; they just alter your perceptual 
experience in some ways – and had a so-called bad trip, then you know what 
it feels like to have the negative aspects of your unconscious mind run riot 
uncontrolled. It’s not a very pleasant thing. 
 
So, you’re beginning to understand that there are important safety valves that 
need to be put into here so that the monsters from the Id don’t get more 
power than you have over them so that your control of your life rises hand-in-
hand with your ability to deal and resolve these shadow parts of yourself so 
they don’t harm your life.  
 
They don’t leave you in the place that Winfried was, which is just sheer panic 
for however long until you either burn out and go back to who you were and 
are afraid to try again, or on rare occasions you learn to master that part of 
your reality and get through it, but not many people can do that part. Do you 
understand where I’m going with this? 
 
I see a lot of concerned faces now. Don’t worry. We’re not going to dive into 
hell just yet, but we do need to build mental muscles that will control the 
monsters from the Id, and mindfulness does that.  
 
Mindfulness & Fear 
 
Igor: 
It builds the physical fibers that switch off the amygdala, which is the one that 
shouts terror and panic, so the things that would normally terrorize you no 
longer do, which means now you get to face them, which means you can start 
accepting them. As the old adage goes, what you resist will persist. What you 
accept, you get the power to transform. Do you understand that? Do you 
have a question or a comment? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Winfried: Is it the same to build those GABA fibers up or is it necessary to have at least 
some experience of this? I’m talking from experience because from before 
and when my blood sugar gets very low, all kinds of things may happen and 
sometimes it’s sheer terror. It was the first time and the second time. The 
third time it was oh, I’ve seen this before. 
 
Igor: 
Winfried, you’re ahead of the game. You are ahead of the game. You see, 
there are two portions to the terror. One is the neurological, the 
neurochemical experience of there’s a dump into your system of adrenaline 
and noradrenaline and all kinds of other stuff, and the other one is your 
interpreter trying to make meaning out of it – which by the way is located in 
your left hemisphere. There’s a nice little bit of research on that one. 
 
 
The problem is if you have a sensation of panic and identify with it, then it 
becomes real for you. Then all there is; is panic and it’s not a nice place to be 
in. That’s what happened the first few times. When you can observe that 
particular experience – so you’re still having a neurochemical experience, but 
you know it’s not you – it’s a lot easier to cope with, isn’t it?  
 
 
Whilst you’re coping with it, guess what you’re building? Your GABA fibers, 
the bits that switch the panic off, which means the panic has never been as 
intense anymore as the first time you had it. Would that be fair to say? 
 
Winfried: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
It’s unfortunate training because you don’t want necessarily to be thrown into 
panic to be able to deal with it, but basically any function that you have the 
more you do it the stronger it gets. If you want a society that’s courageous, 
they need to practice courage.  
 
 
If we make life safe, we would be a society of cowards, not because we’re 
incapable of being courageous but because the neural networks that shut off 
fear and let us do things despite fear and so on haven’t been exercised. They’ll 
blow a fuse at a small amount of challenge, whereas with practice you would 
be able to tolerate much larger amounts of fear, problems and so on. 
 
 
If you want a good example of this, look at people who have just recently 
been in war. They have a very different understanding of the world than when 
they were trained to be a soldier and thought oh, this is good fun.

So, your ability to deal with fear is very important, especially in any self-
related work because if you cannot deal with fear, panic or terror, then how 
on Earth are you going to work with yourself? You can work with those things 
that are already strengths. That’s your light side the fun stuff like oh this is 
great and this is fantastic and so on. 
 
 
However, I suspect those things won’t get you out of Bucket Land because the 
walls of Bucket Land were put up on purpose to protect you from those things 
that were too terrifying for you to deal with. Do you understand? Thank you, 
Winfried. I appreciate that. 
 
 
Again, I don’t mean to do this to frighten you about what we’re doing because 
what we’ll be doing is going to be very safe and the chance of you actually 
confronting any kind of intense fear like that here is very, very low. It will only 
happen if you’ve already had practice building these GABA fibers and shutting 
fear off and then you’ll actually really enjoy meeting that challenge. 
 
 
For those of you who have less practice with that, we’ll get to the point where 
you will start building that strength so that in time you can face any terror 
your mind can present to you and it will be just fine, just another day at work 
for you but that will require time, it will require effort and it will require 
building a mental muscle that most of us have spent a lifetime avoiding.  
 
 
That’s me included, by the way. It’s only relatively recently that I’ve started 
facing my own fears and there’s a lot of it there. I didn’t know there was so 
much.  
 
 
We’re going to do it all step by step. You have this much strength in your 
ability to handle fears; therefore, you’ll only deal with this level of problems 
inside your mind and as you master that, this increases and so the nature of 
the problems can increase but you’ll always be in control of that process. Do 
you understand what we’re doing here? 
 
 
Let’s get back to the discussion of mindfulness because mindfulness is one of 
the most researched tools that does exactly this. We have an actual physical, 
neurological, traceable, observable architecture in the brain through these 
GABA fibers that gives us a mechanism for turning that fear off, allowing that 
emotional energy to transform into bliss, love and happiness; hence the

promise I made you at the start of this course, but we need to train it and we 
need to train it in a couple of different ways. 
 
 
Now that leads us onto a problem.  
 
Why Meditators Fail 
 
Igor: 
How many of you have ever tried to meditate before? How many of you fell 
asleep, got bored or gave up? This is a very common thing.  
 
 
The only people who stick with meditations are those for whom the dream 
has excited them so much that they’re willing to put up with boredom, stress 
and all the other stuff that comes with it until they actually learn the 
mechanisms of it. 
 
 
You see, the problem with meditation, especially in an English environment or 
in a Western environment – because I think German, Spanish and French are 
equally inept at describing mental experiences – if you ask any person who’s 
grown up for example in Tibet or in the Tibetan refuge with the Dalai Lama or 
something like that, it’s very difficult for them to translate something they’ve 
grown up from the age of 10 doing to a Western audience, so they give you 
metaphors and flowery language and a lot gets lost in translation, although 
it’s much better than that movie. 
 
 
So, we need to start looking at what’s going wrong. Why do most people who 
try to meditate fail? Why do they give up? What’s going on and how can you 
flip that around? Would that be of interest to you? 
 
 
Here comes in a nice little researched called Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi, apart from having an interesting name that most people 
cannot pronounce, is a psychologist who started changing the trend in 
psychology because up until that point basically most psychology was 
abnormal psychology. 
 
 
In other words, what do people do when things go wrong? You have an 
accident and your brain gets destroyed and you suddenly can’t speak 
anymore. Oh great, psychologists get excited. Come in and I’ll spend the next 
10 years torturing you to find out why you can’t speak anymore.

A lot gets learned about the brain, but the poor person being studied of 
course is a little less fortunate because it’s not as pleasant for them, but we 
learned a lot because of these things.  
 
 
So, for the first 90 years of psychology developing as a discipline – so for most 
of the 20th Century – psychologists were only interested in what happens 
when things go wrong. What happens when you’re sad, when you’re 
depressed, when you’re suicidal, when you have these physical problems and 
so on? 
 
 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi was one of the next generation of psychologists who 
started getting interested in what happens when people do things well. 
Shock! How do people who actually cope with life do things? How do people 
who are actually happy become happy?  
 
 
The crazy thing he found is that it was irrelevant what station in life they had. 
A factory worker could have a more successful and happy life within the 
confines of the factory than a CEO, but sometimes the CEO had that.  
 
 
Basically he had a huge study that was carried out across the globe at many 
different universities and so on, and he wrote a book called The Psychology of 
Optimal Experience. It’s a wonderful book.  
 
 
It basically repeats the same idea for all 200-plus pages of it, which he could 
have given you probably in the Introduction and you’d be done with it, so I’d 
like to give you the main idea here.

When people perform certain tasks in a particular kind of way, they 
automatically enter what we call the flow state. This is where we got the flow 
state from. Has anyone here heard the term flow state? He created it. Sports 
psychologists talk about the zone. It’s still a flow state. 
 
You know you’re in the flow state because certain things begin to happen. 
You lose your sense of self, your personal identity. You basically identify with 
the tasks that you’re engaging in and you lose yourself within it. You lose a 
sense of time. Time gets distorted for you. There’s an overall feeling of 
wellbeing and satisfaction whilst you’re experiencing it.  
 
He had a whole list of seven or nine points that tell you you’re in the flow 
right now. That’s a useful list to have. If you want, I’ll look it up for you and 
present it to you tomorrow, but that’s not the important part that I’m 
particularly interested in. 
 
What is interesting is how do you get into that flow where all this magic 
happens, where you suddenly become better at tasks than everyone else, 
where you’re happier, where your health actually seems to improve on its 
own? 
 
He came up with a very simple formula that will automatically get people into 
that flow state, and that’s what you’re seeing right here. He measures two 
things: 
 
1. What is the challenge that the task you’re engaging in presents to you? 
2. What is your skill level?  
 
If your skill level matches the task, you’ll be in the zone – that flow channel. 
It’s a channel. It’s not like a point. In other words, if your skill is a little lower 
but the task is a lot higher, you can still be in that channel. Remember what 
we talked about earlier – a small amount of stress is still useful for the 
learning process. 
 
Also if your skill is high and the challenge is lower, you can still be within that 
channel, but the thing that’s interesting is what happens when you pop out of 
that channel? If the challenge is higher than your skill ability to cope with it, 
you reach anxiety, stress, tension.

If the challenge required to do the particular task is significantly lower than 
the skill that you have, you basically hit boredom. For those of you that are 
ex-failed meditators, would it be fair to say that the reason you pretty much 
gave up on it is either you were bored or getting more stressed by trying to do 
it and figuring out I can’t do it. What do you mean silence my mind? I can’t 
silence my mind. Every time I try to silence my mind, look there’s my words 
again so I lose my mind. What do you want from me? 
 
That’s a little bit of the kind of things that have been going on there, right? I 
get this a lot. As you know I have a self-hypnosis course out there, and the 
amount of stress it’s caused some individuals who didn’t understand how to 
engage with a task, they increased what they thought was required of them in 
the task, so the challenge shot through the roof.  
 
Their skill level being tiny was no way commensurate with the challenge task, 
so they overloaded with stress and anxiety, and as a result some people want 
to give up. It’s not that they can’t do it. It’s that they’re doing the wrong thing.  
 
The analogy I like to use is it’s kind of like being in the ring with Mike Tyson. 
Without ever having done a single day of boxing in your life and let alone no 
fitness training, that’s going to cause a little bit of stress to most people, isn’t 
it? 
 
Now contrast that to getting in the ring with a five-month-old baby, gruesome 
images aside, you might get a little bit bored of beating up this poor kid 
because the challenge there is very low, and your skill level no matter how 
low it may be will still outrank the infant. 
 
So, the secret is to stay in that channel. You’ve got to make sure you break 
down the task that you’re doing so that what you can actually do – your skill 
level – matches what is required of you to succeed to some measure within 
that task, and that’s where mindfulness practices that I’ve come across so far 
and what most meditation practices I have come across so far have failed big 
time. 
 
They try to be gentle with you. Oh, be gentle with yourself. Be nice to 
yourself. What they’re really saying is take the pressure off yourself and lower 
your barrier so that you can do this.

Mindfulness With Flow 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do with you now is engage in a process of ratcheting up the 
intensity of mindfulness practice from ridiculously easy to increasing levels of 
difficulty, and somewhere along the lines you’ll find your level, which will be 
an enjoyable flow state and that’s where you can stay.  
 
Then you can go onto the next levels as you progress, as your skill level 
becomes more commensurate with what you’re doing. Now, inside you have 
a very simple thermometer or a barometer of what’s going on. The more 
stressed you become, the more you’ve taken on too much in that particular 
task – in this case mindfulness practice. 
 
On the flipside the more bored you become, then you haven’t set yourself 
enough of a challenge to deal with it. Expert meditators in mindfulness for 
example make very fine nuances, very fine distinctions with what they’re 
doing because it increases the difficulty so they don’t get bored.  
 
We’ll get into that as we’re doing it now, and I’d like for you to be able to do 
that for yourself so that you’ll find out where you start doing it, knowing that 
even just a small portion repeated frequently will build your GABA fibers and 
create that strength just as much as hours long of meditation would do, which 
you would never do anyway because you haven’t developed the capacity to 
do that yet. Do you understand where I’m going with this? 
 
As we did earlier, let’s have a baseline reading, something to compare against. 
I’m going to give you the most basic, simple meditation practice out there, 
mindfulness in particular, the one that actually builds that areas that we’re 
interested in just to see how you cope with it. 
 
Now I’ll warn you that most of you will not like it. I’ll just warn you right now. 
That’s okay. We’re just getting a baseline. Some of you might get very 
frustrated by it, and again just note it and just realize why that’s happening 
and don’t take it too seriously. This is a baseline and nothing else. 
 
I’ll show you how to start building up to that so that it becomes easier for you. 
So, whatever experience you’re about to have has no bearing whatsoever on 
your ability to do this task.

In the traditional mindfulness practice, you’ll hear people say just follow your 
breathing, just pay attention to your breathing. If you go to a meditation 
retreat like I did, you start at about 6:00 a.m. and you finish around 6:00 p.m., 
and the time in between apart from a very short break for lunch is just sitting 
cross-legged and watching your breathing. It’s not very easy by the way. 
 
That’s the hard way to do it. Then of course if you look to the forum and say 
help I can’t cope with 12 hours of meditating straight, what do I do? Then 
people say oh just start simple, start with five minutes. 
 
So, let’s see if it is that simple. Let’s just do one minute – 60 seconds.  A drop 
in the ocean – 60 seconds – and all I want you to do is close your eyes and 
follow your breathing. Notice your breathing. If you lose track of your 
breathing, come back to it. Just follow your breathing and see one happens 
for one minute. 
 
All right folks. I’ve released you. Come back and let’s have a little chat about 
your experiences. Good, bad and ugly, just share a little bit about what you 
noticed going on as that was happening. This is the interactive portion of the 
seminar. 
 
All right, let me ask you some questions in that case. Who here found it 
boring? Put your hands up. Just one person? Wow that’s unusual. Who here 
found it difficult to keep your attention on your breathing for a minute? Put 
your hands up.  
 
Who here kind of lost track of your breathing and had to come back to it more 
than a couple of times? Who here was a little frustrated about losing it and 
having to go back to it? Put your hands up? Oh, a couple of hands.  
 
These are very common things that are occurring in beginning meditation 
practices, and bear in mind you’ve only done 60 seconds of that. Now make 
that five times longer, so five minutes that people recommend you start with, 
and that’s not even the half hour that people recommend you do on a daily 
basis to kind of get the most out of it, and it’s nothing like the 12 hours that 
professional monks do, and it is a profession at that point. 
 
Maybe the Tibetans if they ever host the Olympic Games can make 
meditation an Olympic sport. It’s very intense but people don’t really get it. 
So, let’s have a look at what’s going on here.

If you were bored, it’s because your mind doesn’t know what to do with it, so 
you lose attention. There are other things. I have spare attention for other 
things and so this is getting boring now. I’m going to let my mind wander a 
little bit.  
 
If you’re getting frustrated with yourself it’s because you’re trying to be 
perfect and keep your attention on your breathing, and you can’t do that. Did 
anyone here get distracted, like the dinging of the streetcar outside and 
started thinking about that, or maybe you felt someone else kind of nudge 
you and you started paying attention to that? Did anyone have that sort of 
sensation going on? 
 
What we want to do are a couple of warm-ups to teach your attention what 
to do with it. The only currency that is of any value inside your mind is your 
attention. Everything else is a construct.  
 
Think about it. You need to attend to something for it to be real to you. Even 
if someone’s going to shoot you – just to use an extreme example – if you 
don’t see the bullet coming you won’t have any fear or any concerns. Your life 
just ends without you knowing why because your attention is what makes the 
reality real enough for you to be worried about it. Do you get the idea? 
 
Most of the time when people try to do mindfulness practice or meditation or 
something like that, what they’re doing is they’re beating themselves up 
because they’re failing at a particular task – in this case paying attention to 
the breathing – because they might get distracted by a sound that they’re 
hearing. 
 
So, the first thing we want to do is we want to start taking control of 
distractions. Meditating in a nice quiet room is not the really difficult task. It’s 
when you start sitting in a coffee shop and kids are blaring and shouting at 
you and needing and demanding and phone calls and all the rest of it.  
 
That’s when you need it the most and that’s when you can do it the least 
because other things are pulling your attention away. Does that make sense? 
Let’s define the magic juice that allows the prefrontal cortex to grow. All 
mindfulness is, is a practice of what people call metacognition or more simply 
put, it’s thinking about thinking.

More accurately, it’s thinking about your mental processes. It’s being aware of 
how your thoughts, your feelings and all these things are going on inside you. 
Are there any engineers in the room? What’s the first thing you have to be 
able to do before you can fix something in an engineering sense? 
 
Student:  Define the problem. 
 
Igor: 
And you’ve got to be able to measure it, don’t you? You have to be able to 
measure something to know what’s going wrong, and you have to be able to 
measure it again to know it’s gone right and that you fixed it. If you’re 
incapable of measuring something, you cannot solve any engineering 
problems. Would that be fair to say, engineers?  
 
 
So, in order to fix an engineering problem, you’ve got to be able to measure 
what’s happening so that you can tell now it’s not working right, and now 
we’ve added the changes and now it’s working better, so these changes are 
working. Do you get the idea? 
 
 
That’s the first point of metacognition. By paying attention to your internal 
experience, you’re learning this is how my mind does things. Now you can 
measure. If you think about it, this morning when we talked about stabilizing 
our mentalization processes, wasn’t that an act of metacognition? You were 
paying attention to how your mind does certain things, what’s improving and 
what isn’t. 
 
 
We need to go slow so that you have things that you can compare against 
each other so that you have a unit of measurement. Mindfulness is measuring 
being able to pay attention to your internal experience so that you can 
measure if something’s going on, something’s happening. 
 
 
Really you’re doing a portion of mindfulness even with the regular ASH 
practice. If you’re getting distracted, then you’re measuring something of 
course as well – the point at which your attention is being lost. Being able to 
direct your attention is the control element. 
 
 
If you want to control a system – again engineers – you need to know what 
you have to be able to direct to where to achieve what you want. If it’s a 
structural issue, you need to be able to direct pressure or forces so that they 
go to the places that can take them and not the places that can’t. If you’re an 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
62 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
electrical engineer, you need to be able to direct electricity – the current – 
through the circuits you need it to flow to get the results you want, etc.  
 
 
Do you get the analogy we’re going with here? Attention is our mental 
energy. It’s the mental forces, the mental electricity that we’re going to be 
working with. 
 
 
We’re going to do a couple of quick exercises to give you mindfulness 
practices that you can do when you can’t do your mindfulness practice 
normally. In other words, think about what distraction means in terms of 
attention flow.  
 
 
It’s not where you’ve decided it should be. It’s somewhere else, but here’s the 
key thing. It keeps going to that somewhere else, doesn’t it? So, your 
attention is still there. It’s not that you can’t concentrate.  
 
 
It’s that you can’t concentrate on what you want to concentrate on, so the 
first thing to practice is telling your mind when I want to concentrate on 
something, or focus on something, or attend to something or be aware of 
something, that’s where it will all go. That’s the muscle that you’re building, 
so why fight yourself? 
 
 
Let’s start off with a simple one. Everyone close your eyes for a moment. 
What I want you to do is pay attention to all the sounds. You can move 
around all that you want because we need some sounds of course. You can 
hear my voice.  
 
 
You can hear people breathing. You can hear maybe a slight hum of the air 
conditioning. You can hear some people clearing their throats. You might hear 
some noises from the street. 
 
 
That’s okay. I want you to be aware of how your attention flows from sound 
to sound to sound. The attention is constant even if the sound is not. What 
you’re learning to do is learning to gather your attention. At this point in time 
it’s through sounds.  
 
 
So, if you found sounds distracting in the past, it’s not distracting. You’re 
succeeding at a different task. What I want you to do now is you’re going to 
spend a minute just paying attention to sounds. All I want you to be aware of 
is which sounds are grabbing your attention right now. That’s it.

All right, bring yourselves back when you’re ready. Who found that easier to 
do than the breathing exercise? Put our hands up. Isn’t that interesting? You 
spent longer doing this exercise than the breathing exercise, but here’s the 
thing. Your task was first of all more clearly defined for you, which means it 
became easier because you were more certain of what you were doing. 
 
Secondly, we didn’t fight what your mind’s doing. We just jumped on its back 
and piggybacked it to something useful. Who here feels a little bit more 
centered, a little bit more focused having done that exercise? 
 
In other words, everyday life has a million distractions and it splits our 
attention in a million different ways, and that’s why we feel unfocused, 
unsettled, ungrounded and so on. By gathering all your attention or as much 
of your attention to one place, your attention starts growing. 
 
Remember, attention is the currency of the mind. Most people try to fight 
their attention, where it’s going, because it’s not going where they want it to 
go yet, but what you’re learning to do right now is essentially creating the 
attentional equivalent of a dam. 
 
If the river is flowing this way, that’s great. Let’s dam it up, let’s save up all 
that attention and then when we want to find a release for it, there will be a 
lot more attention at our disposal to do that, to achieve whatever we want to 
achieve. Do you understand where I’m going with this? 
 
This is the first rule of thumb you should keep inside your mind.  
 
 Whenever you do any kind of mindfulness training, if there is a 
distraction, follow it because having clear attention is more important 
than having it on a specific type of thing. 
 
Now it’s true having awareness on something like breathing has particular 
value for certain reasons, but what is the point of attempting that – even if it’s 
not a Mike Tyson for you, it still could be an amateur boxer and you still have 
no experience of it. Let’s get your mind doing what it’s doing well first and 
then we’ll start expanding to do what you need it to second. Do you get the 
idea? 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
64 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
The same is true of anything – physical sensation, sounds and things you’re 
seeing. Those are the three main senses that people get distracted by. 
Occasionally it smells and taste and so on, but it’s relatively rare unless you 
have a very sensitive olfactory sense or you happen to be eating whilst you’re 
meditating, which also is impossible. You can eat your food mindfully, which 
means you’re paying attention to the texture and the taste and so on. 
 
So, you get the idea that this is part of your daily life and the key here is you 
only did it for a minute or so. Did I ask you to do it for 10 minutes? An hour? A 
day? No. Why? Because it’s the equivalent.  
 
Doing this for a whole day is the equivalent of me taking you to a gym and 
doing lots and lots of workouts. You are capable of it but you’re so unused to 
it that you’ll need me to motivate you to keep going to do it. 
 
Just because you’re capable of it doesn’t mean you’ll want to do it, but can I 
say to you just pick up those weights five times and just put them down 
again? That’s a lot easier a task, isn’t it? It’s a much smaller proposition, so the 
chances of you popping into anxiety are much lower, aren’t they? 
 
Because the task is very clearly defined for you, the chances of you being 
bored by it are also much lower. If you are bored by it, by the way, then it just 
tells you let’s make the task more interesting. In other words, let’s refine it. 
Let’s find some nuances within it that are going to be more difficult to do. 
Does that make sense? 
 
Now I’ll give you an experience of what I mean. So far you did a very simple 
task, which is mindful. In other words, you paid attention to your attention. 
You paid attention to how your senses – in this case the sense of sound – 
sucked your attention towards a particular sound and then bounced to 
another sound and another sound, but the attention started growing and 
growing as you were aware of that attention. Is that correct? 
 
So, let’s make it more difficult. I’ll warn you that some of you will get bored 
with this and some of you will get frustrated with this, and that’s fine. Some 
of you will enjoy it because your attention can handle this.  
 
What I want you to do for the next minute is again close your eyes and trace 
the sounds like you did before, only this time I want you to pay attention only 
to sounds that are high pitched. Close your eyes.

All right, bring yourselves back. How was that? Was that easier or harder to 
do than the previous version of the same exercise? Put your hands up if it was 
easier. Put your hands up if it was harder. So, most of you found that harder 
and some found it a little bit easier. I suspect the easier part of it is because 
you’re already short of attention or maybe you’re more familiar with this sort 
of work, in which case you can do it. You’ve been warmed up for it. 
 
Most people find it harder because the task is more complex. You’re looking 
for a nuance rather than anything goes. The more bored you get with a 
particular meditation, mindfulness practice and so on, the more nuances, the 
more subtleties like this you pull out and make it a game for yourself, and that 
game is designed to keep you right here in the flow channel. 
 
Allow me to give you an analogy of this. This is from the Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi book. He found that certain workers were not only 
outperforming every other worker, they were better on an assembly line. 
They would do a better job. They’d be faster and get more done at a better 
quality level and so on, and here’s the reason for it.  
 
At some point these particular workers fell into the flow channel and they 
enjoyed it. It was a very pleasurable place to be. That’s why meditation, once 
you get good at it, is a little buzz. That’s something people normally have to 
take artificial stimulants for, because the flow channel is a very pleasant place 
to be in. 
 
So, here they are putting some gadget together and it’s boring. Why? Because 
when they first do it, it’s stressful. They don’t know how to do it so they’re 
trying to keep up. Then they learn how to do it and they’re in the flow and it 
feels good. Then it becomes routine and it gets boring. 
 
Now most people kind of give up – life sucks but you do it because you need 
the money or whatever. Some people on the other hand decide to play games 
with the assembly line to increase the challenge. They might decide that they 
turn every can just so, so the labels are all facing the same way. 
 
It’s irrelevant for the process but it’s more difficult, which keeps them in the 
flow and out of boredom. They might decide I did 10 units an hour yesterday, 
so let’s see if I can do 11 today. Once again, now time crunch becomes a thing 
and so they get out of boredom by crunching the time.

Now if that’s externally imposed, they get into stress. Doing 12? I can barely 
do eight. Are you crazy? Do you see where we’re going with this? They’ve 
been pushed into anxiety because their skill level is not commensurate with 
that yet, and sometimes it’s just because they’ve been forced – in other 
words they’ve lost control. That’s another issue right there. 
 
So, those people who excel at these particular tasks are excelling because 
really they’ve unconsciously intuited that it feels good to be in the flow state 
and whenever they get bored, they have to increase the challenge to stay 
there.  
 
It’s the same thing you do with this. You start off with whatever is actually an 
enjoyable process. As soon as you start getting bored, it means you’ve 
mastered that level and you need to add a nuance so that it’s more 
challenging to keep you in the flow state. 
 
Recall the breathing meditation you did for about a minute or so. Let’s see if 
we can turn that into something actually pleasant, something you’re likely to 
do every day because it’s easy to do and it’s fun to do. In other words, you 
have a built-in reward to the actual task, which is really what the flow channel 
does for you. 
 
Mindful Breathing Count 
 
Igor: 
Would you like to experiment with that? What I would like for you to do now 
is I’d like for you to select some portion of your breathing that currently grabs 
your attention. It could be the sensation of the breath going through your 
nostrils.  
 
It could be the feeling of your chest rising and falling or your belly expanding 
and contracting. It could be the sense of it coming down your throat or the 
back of your nose where the hair’s pulling in. It could just be the sound of 
your own breathing. 
 
I don’t care what you choose. Don’t try to regulate your breathing. Just let 
your breathing happen. Just choose some portion of your act of breathing 
that is easy for you to attend to. Once you have that, I’d like you to close your 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

eyes and just count 10 iterations of that – in other words 10 examples of that 
particular sensation occurring – and then come on back. 
 
When you’ve collected 10 breaths in whatever way you attended to it, just 
open your eyes so that I’ll know we can continue. Ten is all we need. Now let 
me ask you a couple of questions.  
 
First of all, who lost track of their numbering? Put your hands up. That’s fine. 
Do you know what that tells you? You don’t start with 10. You start with five 
or four or even one. If you’re having a really bad day, one breath. Okay, I’ve 
done that. I’ve succeeded now. Anything to keep you out of the anxiety level. 
 
Now here’s the interesting part. Believe it or not, that exercise lasted not 
quite a minute. It was less than a minute. I didn’t keep track of the time but it 
was at least 30 seconds. It was getting towards that minute mark, although it 
wasn’t quite as long as the other one. 
 
Those of you who lost count, wherever you lost count at is your new number. 
For those of you who didn’t lose count, 10 is still your current number. Do it 
again. 
 
Whenever you achieve whatever number you set out to achieve, don’t worry 
about going forwards from that. Just bring yourselves back with your eyes 
open so that we can discuss that a little bit.  
 
There are a few of you still finishing up and that’s fine. I’ll work with the rest 
of you for now. Let me ask you a couple of questions about your experiences. 
First of all, who found those two particular breathing exercises easy to do? 
Put your hands up. 
 
Importantly, who found those particular exercises interesting, fun, engaging 
or somehow pleasant to do? Put your hands up. If you didn’t find them 
pleasant, chances are it’s because you were bored or stressed, which basically 
means you simplify the task or complicate the task, depending on where 
you’re at. 
 
It does not matter what I do. What matters is what works for you. You 
understand the rule now, do you not? So, you can do this. Now here’s the 
cool thing. Do you recall all the way back at the beginning of this session that

we did a one-minute breathing exercise? Would it be fair to say it was 
relatively difficult to do? 
 
This one was easier to do. Would that be fair to say? You did more than a 
minute. You just did two goes of it. If you have a heavy case to bring up the 
stairs and you can’t lift it, what do you do? You empty it and you go twice or 
three times because you’re not strong enough to do it once. 
 
If you go some meditation retreat and this guy who’s been doing it for 20 
years and is obviously very good at it, why on Earth would you try to do it his 
way? His mental muscle for that kind of attention is so much more well 
developed that yours is.  
 
I’m not saying it’s futile but it’s a very painful way of doing it, and the chance 
that you’ll continue that practice is very low because it’s got a built-in 
punishment as opposed to a built-in reward. Who here feels rewarded by that 
practice that you just did? Was that nice? 
 
You had the same minute by the way. You just did it in your pace, in your rate. 
Who here thinks the chances of you doing a minute of mindfulness breathing 
like that in two little parts that are easier for you to do is something you’re 
more likely to do for the rest of your life than the first thing we did today, 
which was that one-minute, which was essentially the same time – or actually 
shorter – but all in one go and the experience you had as a result of that? 
 
Which of you thinks you’re more likely to do for the rest of your life this way? 
It’s because you have built-in motivation now because that flow state 
automatically rewards you for the task that you’re doing. You haven’t 
exceeded the skill level required of you. Does that make sense? 
 
Session Debrief 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s have some questions, comments or experiences that we can talk   
about  a little bit.  
 
Student: Hi. I had a problem with it. It’s really easy for me to go to sleep when I do this. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. Thank you. That makes four or five your number. That’s it. I know 
exactly what you’re talking about because I did the same thing, especially

because I’ve got the little self-hypnosis and my preferred way of doing self-
hypnosis is to totally crash out. 
 
 
Then usually I’ll come back at the end of the induction but sometimes I just 
don’t want to. I want to just stay there and it feels so good, but then I’ve 
trained my neurology to essentially fall asleep with the induction. It will still 
work but it limits my scope. 
 
 
So, I’ve had to undo that and just like yourself I had to go with like two or 
three breaths because I couldn’t go beyond that because my neurology kept 
trying to go down the sleep path and that’s no good.  
 
 
I said to myself, self 10 breaths, come on, what’s wrong with you? I’m 
training. Do you understand where I’m going with this? Do you understand 
why we’re just trying to break this stuff down to make it easy and make it fun 
because if it’s not easy and it’s not fun, you won’t do it. Boring is different.  
 
Student: I’ve got the power of self hypnosis. It’s great but I keep falling asleep. 
 
Igor: 
You and me both. We have exactly the same experience, and it works great 
for that approach but there are limitations built into self-hypnosis that we 
can’t supersede. We need a different approach to it and that’s what we’re 
engaging in here right now. 
 
 
Let me talk a little bit about the limitations of self-hypnosis. When you’re 
being hypnotized by someone else, they’re guiding and you’re just having the 
experience, so you’re separating awarenesses. There’s a guiding awareness 
that’s independent from the experiential awareness.  
 
 
When you’re doing self-hypnosis, you’re trying to do both at the same time 
and there’s a conflict because a guiding awareness is most likely to activate 
things like the critical factor and so on that block the experience.  
 
 
They can be circumvented. One way of circumventing is your experience of 
falling asleep to it, which basically is surrendering to the unconscious. It’s just 
the way your mind knows how to do it, and you’ll typically still get the results. 
Not always, but that’s when there’s a disconnect. That’s another issue.

The problem with that is you’re teaching your consciousness, your control 
factor, to get out of the way entirely. You can no longer direct things. You 
can’t have a dialog with your unconscious mind when you’re absent.  
 
 
Seeing as our whole purpose here, our whole premise is to say I don’t know 
how to get out of Bucket Land, but I need you – unconscious mind – to teach 
me how to get out of Bucket Land so that I can do it consistently and live my 
life this way, I need to be conscious of that process but in a way that I can’t 
interfere with it, and that’s the whole point of this training. 
 
 
Once you have that, you can do it any way you wish, but to get there we need 
to very slowly and methodically look at all the different nuances inside the 
mind, because if I just said to you all right let’s do some mindfulness practice 
follow your breathing, that will strengthen it and then I’ll get them to do some 
more visualization stuff – you guys would have been lost at the starting post 
because we don’t have a shared vocabulary. We’re now beginning to develop 
one.  
 
 
Is this making sense to you? You’re beginning to understand that when I say 
mindfulness breathing, I do not mean six breaths because you’ll be asleep by 
the sixth one. With you, I mean four. With you, I’d mean probably two. For 
others it would be 10. Some of you will be 20 or 30. It doesn’t matter what 
the number is. 
 
 
What matters is your ability to cope with it so that you’re in that flow zone. 
Does that help? Is this useful so far? By the way, is this beginning to explain to 
you why you failed in the past and how to overcome that particular failure 
when it comes to meditation practices? 
 
 
They are very useful? They build good solid neurology that is useful for you, 
but why do it the hard way?  
 
Student: Hi. I have a couple of questions. One of them is when we’re walking for 
instance, it’s automatic. You don’t have to put thought into it. It just happens. 
How do you get to do this so it goes in a normal flow, a natural flow? What 
does it take to get the permanent result? That’s the first question. 
 
Igor: 
The first thing is, like anything else, practice makes permanent. You’ll get to a 
very interesting point with practice, which is you automate your attention. So, 
you’re still attentive but it just wants to rest there normally.

Let me put it this way. Has anyone here ever watched a movie in a cinema? 
Believe it or not, you have to learn to be able to do that. Has anyone here 
ever taken a child to watch a movie in the cinema? Do they look the same as 
the adults in the room? They act up. Isn’t that what kids do? Why? Because 
their attention has faltered.  
 
 
When their attention falters, the experience is no longer there for them. They 
just have the images and sounds on the screen. It’s irrelevant to them, so they 
get bored. Their task gets altered. You and I have practiced going to the 
cinema so much that we’ve gone from 10 minute little video clips that mom 
shows us on TV, to half-hour clips, to one-hour movies.  
 
 
By the way, how long are movies for kids? Are they ever over an hour? It’s 
very rare, isn’t it? It’s because kids don’t have that attention span. Their 
attentional muscle isn’t strong enough.  
 
 
Now if you get something like one of my favorites, which is The Lord of the 
Rings, it’s four hours. It’s so long that they have to give you a break to go pee 
and come back again because otherwise I’d sit there and cross my legs and I’d 
still watch the thing. 
 
 
I have learned to habituate my attention to be locked on the experience of 
watching the movie and so on. The same is true of any other process. In some 
ways you could call watching a movie a form of meditation in some ways. The 
thing that’s missing from watching a movie is not the attentional stream. It’s 
clearly there and it’s clearly locked. 
 
 
The thing that’s missing is metacognition. It’s being aware that you’re doing it 
and that’s the bit that we’re training right now, but that needs to be built up. 
It’s something that we do not do as a culture. In fact the introspective 
movement – which was the original approach to psychology – started with 
introspective movements and then because they wanted to have scientific 
validity, they went to the external things. 
 
 
Behaviorism was a very large part of that movement – that’s now changed 
with the neuroscience of course – precisely because you can measure 
behavior but you can’t measure subjective experiences, which doesn’t lend 
itself to creating or establishing scientific validity.

Psychology is filled with problems like that, which personally I think it has 
solved very poorly. Because as a culture we don’t pay attention to our 
attention – where it goes and what it does – we are very weak in the skill of 
metacognition, but just like your attention has been trained so you can watch 
something for four hours solid provided it does the right things that fits your 
attentional gap. Like that, you can train both faculties equally. 
 
 
As some of you may know, I used to be a lawyer and lawyers do a lot of 
reading, a lot of proofreading and a lot of finding mistakes in documents. 
When I first started doing this, after 10 minutes I lost focus. It was like what 
the heck is going on? I felt frustrated, sleepy, like punching someone. I mean 
just all kinds of things. 
 
 
I had to go lock myself in the toilet at lunch break for an hour to sleep. It was 
that bad. The buggers removed the lid to the toilet seat just so you wouldn’t 
be able to do that, but I was so desperate I didn’t care. 
 
 
But in time I got to the point where I could spend six hours reading the same 
document and finding a typo 600 pages later. My mind would just attune to it. 
Any task that you perform sufficiently well for a sufficient length of time, you 
will improve at it. It just becomes natural. 
 
 
Metacognition is a weakness in our entire culture. There are very few people 
who can do it, which is why five breaths can be a challenge for someone. So, 
why on Earth would you start with five minutes? That’s crazy.  
 
 
If you want to do five minutes, do five breaths, reward yourself, acknowledge 
the success, tick something off on a sheet, record it in some way, jump up and 
down and say yay. Take a break and do whatever you want and then do 
another five breaths and another five breaths.  
 
 
When you get bored doing that, it means your attention or your 
metacognition has strengthened sufficiently that five breaths now has gone 
into the boring range. What do you do then? You do six breaths, seven 
breaths, eight breaths or whatever happens to be your thing.  
 
 
Do you understand where I’m going with this? Does this answer your 
question?

Student: Yes. The second question is going back to the GABA fibers. What is your 
opinion on using transcranial stimulation or psycho-nutrition for that matter? 
 
Igor: 
What do you mean by transcranial stimulation? 
 
Student: You know, right now they have this device that you can put on different parts 
of your brain and then have stimulation, and they’ve done some research 
with it but the results are not permanent. 
 
Igor: 
Of course and that’s the main issue right there. Remember, what are you 
training with metacognition? You are training your awareness of awareness. If 
you try to delegate your awareness of awareness to a machine, where’s your 
metacognition now? 
 
 
If the machine is doing the metacognition for you, it will reach nirvana before 
you do. I have no problems with it as a way for example of strengthening 
certain brain functions to kind of train them, but it’s the equivalent of putting 
a plaster cast on your leg when it’s broken.  
 
 
If someone has so many problems that their ability to stay focused for even a 
moment is dissolving, it can be a great stabilizer perhaps, maybe even 
meditation or psycho-nutrition as you would call it, which would be coming 
from more natural sources than the stuff that gives you weird side effects. 
 
 
That again can be a stabilizer factor and for some small minority who have big 
problems that is required for them to be able to be stable enough to do 
something with it, but you will never win a race with a cast on your leg.  
 
 
At some point it has to come off, and you have to learn to stand on the leg. 
You have to learn to walk on the leg and then you have to learn to run on that 
leg. So, is it useful? By all means. Yes, enjoy it. I think it would be fascinating. 
Can it assist? Absolutely. If it will assist the process, that’s fantastic, but never 
lose sight of the main skill that is required of you, which is metacognition. 
 
 
I’m actually delighted that Winfried is in this room because he shared the 
story about diabetes and terror before. Think about what he said without 
realizing he was saying it.

He’s saying I’m no longer terrified when my blood sugar goes too low because 
I have developed my metacognition. I’m aware of my terror in a new way and 
it’s no longer terrifying. Your body still does it, doesn’t it Winfried? 
 
Winfried: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
You’ll actually still probably shake. You should have the tension in the 
stomach. You have a desire to run and do something or hide or you have the 
emotional need to do something with it. 
 
Winfried: It’s worse than that. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. I’m just giving you a general thing there, but the point is it no 
longer affects you because you have a strong enough metacognition that the 
fear just does its thing. Oh, I’m terrified, let’s go eat something. That’s the 
new equation that your mind generates, isn’t it? Is this making sense to you? 
 
 
This is a very simple practice we’ve done so far, but if you doubt me please 
talk to Winfried on the break. This was not set up at all, and I’m just very glad 
you happened to be in the front. This is exactly what he needs to do.  
 
 
The problem is for someone in Winfried’s position he had to do it by default. 
He had to be terrified for long enough to learn to be metacognizant of it to 
then be okay with it. Because he has the kind of personality that hangs 
outside of Bucket Land no matter what the problems are, he has learned to 
cope with it quickly. 
 
 
Now I will guarantee you there will be other diabetics who have the same 
thing who are still terrified of that terror because they’ve never developed 
metacognition to cope with it. Does that make sense? Thank you for the 
question. Is this useful to you guys? 
 
 
The problem is we have to move at a very slow pace because you need to 
understand what to do with your mind. Otherwise it will look really 
complicated when it isn’t. It’s just that your mind is trying to do the wrong 
thing, and I’ve got to be as precise as I can with you so that you realize 
everything will be very easy and should be a lot of fun.

This is the weird part. We haven’t got there and many of you won’t get there 
on this seminar, but the skills you’ll develop will get you there, even to the 
point where you will be thrilled at being terrified.  
 
 
In fact you won’t even be satisfied until terror comes. It’s like oh come on, I 
was hoping for something bigger today, but it requires some work to get 
there and we need to understand how to work before we can do the work 
because otherwise you will practice the wrong thing and it will make the 
wrong things permanent.  
 
Student: I just wanted to share my experience because I think it’s the way I trained my 
mind in terms of multitasking. So, what I noticed was I could be 100% noticing 
the rise and fall of my chest, counting the breaths and also at the very same 
time as I had my attention there, I could also be attentive to maybe one or 
two other things and be both 100% attentive in both. So, I don’t know if this is 
normal. 
 
Igor: 
Well, what is normal? How are we going to know if it’s normal if we don’t 
even have a society that does metacognition? What I can tell you is this. What 
you’re doing is essentially the same thing as a hardcore Buddhist, which I 
know sounds very strange to use Buddhist and hardcore in the same 
sentence, but we’re talking about these people who do 30, 60 or 120-day 
retreats where all you do is you get up at 5:00 in the morning and you have 
your breakfast in silence.  
 
 
You don’t even make eye contact with other people. You meditate until 
lunchtime. You eat a very small amount and then you meditate until dusk. You 
go to sleep and it starts all over again for 120 days. Some people do six-month 
retreats. Actually some people go for year-long treats where not a word is 
spoken.  
 
 
If most of us tried that, we’d go nuts. Do you think they’re still following their 
breath in the same way as you are, just paying attention to right in front of 
their chest? Heck no. 
 
 
They’ve probably mapped out which rib is moving and by how much because 
otherwise they would be bored and they would not be able to do the task. Do 
you see where I’m going with this?

You’ve just discovered another way of doing that. The only thing I would 
recommend to you is the more you can constrain your attention to things 
involved with the actual task – in other words the rising and falling of the 
chest and maybe and the sensation of the nostrils as the air goes in and out; 
that would be more useful to you because it’s the same task – than rising and 
falling of your chest and the frequency of buses driving past outside, which 
has less to do with the actual task. 
 
 
So, the more you can constrain it to the task, the richer the task becomes as 
opposed to having two separate tasks, which have separate levels of 
attention. Does that help? All we’re really talking about here is once again 
being in the flow. 
 
 
It’s not enough for you to pay attention to the rising and falling of your chest 
because you’d hit boredom because your attention is more disciplined than 
that and if your attention isn’t there, who cares? You start wherever you’re 
starting. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Winfried: You were leading to this question already, although it was on my mind before. 
I don’t know if it’s part of this seminar at all, but isn’t it much more about 
intention than about attention because if you have intention, your attention 
will find something worthwhile? 
 
Igor: 
Tomorrow we’ll get into exactly this distinction. 
 
Winfried: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
But you cannot have intention without attention because attention is the fuel 
of the known. How can you intend something if you’re not aware of it? It’s the 
fuel.  
 
 
You may automate the attention so that your unconscious mind’s running it 
whilst you’re thinking of something else. That can happen. That’s the question 
Eugene was asking about, which is can you habituate the attention? If you 
habituate it enough, then certain intentions will happen automatically 
because they become unconscious at that point.

77 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Winfried: Yes, well, it seems to be its if I have the intention, I will make this, which I did 
in this case, but it will make this exercise worthwhile, but then the intention is 
finding something without myself even knowing it does. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. The mechanisms are irrelevant. That’s part of the unconscious 
processes that are involved. I think to some degree our disconnect is because 
we haven’t talked about intention yet, so we may be having a slightly 
different mental experience.  
 
 
Let’s just focus for the moment on the stuff we’ve actually shared experiences 
of and when you have some experience of intention, that’s when we can pick 
up the question again. Is that okay? 
 
Student: I want to clarify metacognition, where is the metacognition when you pay 
attention to your breathing? Is the metacognition into where you’re paying 
attention and breathing? 
 
Igor: 
Metacognition basically means thinking about thinking, although I think more 
accurately it’s thinking about or being aware of your awareness, what you’re 
experience is doing right now. 
 
 
When you’re paying attention to your breathing, that’s part of your 
experience. It’s a habitual experience because it’s happening automatically. 
You’re not trying to interfere with your breathing and have a special breathing 
pattern. That’s a very different kind of training. 
 
 
You’re just noticing something, a biological mechanism in action and there’s 
the metacognition. Now I appreciate there are no thoughts involved in that 
yet. Why? Because it’s simpler because keeping track of your thoughts is a lot 
harder than keeping track of your breathing. 
 
 
The beautiful thing about breathing is that it’s a semi-conscious process. In 
other words, both your conscious mind and your unconscious mind can run 
that process, which is why it’s such a wonderful doorway and why I believe 
that so many meditation practices use the breathing because it is the 
threshold between both controls. 
 
 
If I asked you to pay attention to your heartbeat for example, it’s a lot more 
difficult for most people to do because they don’t have the awareness of it 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
78 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
because they’ve never tried to control it, so it’s very rare that we’re aware of 
our own heartbeats.  
 
 
You can do it absolutely, but it’s a more difficult task because you don’t have 
any conscious involvement with it, so you don’t know how to sense it that 
way.  
 
 
To come back to the idea of metacognition, by paying attention to your 
breathing, you’re essentially doing the same thing you did when you were 
paying attention to the sounds around you, which is basically pure sensory 
experience without the layer of thought about it, which is why I define 
metacognition not as thinking about thinking, which would be a divorce level 
up here. It’s thinking about your experience. Your senses are part of your 
cognition and you’re constraining it to purely the breathing aspects, which 
have no beliefs, ideas, etc. around it because then you don’t complicate it. 
 
 
 
When we come onto things like terror, like Winfried had – let’s say you’re 
now engaging with terror. Terror has a lot of thoughts around it. This is bad. 
I’ve got to get away. I’ve got to hide. I’ve got to cry. I’ve got to hit something. 
I’ve got to take drugs. I’ve got to distract myself. 
 
 
There are a lot of these extra thoughts and then of course there will be 
thoughts about those thoughts – oh my God it must be because he said this or 
she did that and so on – and this is when you start creating a whole unhealthy 
worldview, which is terrible. 
 
 
A lot of people who are caught in terror by the way will do this. In your left 
hemisphere of your brain there’s a network, which tells you stories to make it 
seem like life has meaning. It’s a very useful network because it makes things 
cohesive. 
 
 
You have so many little machines running inside your mind that do different 
things that you should feel like the world’s best schizophrenic. It’s a very 
disjointed image and if you were to experience your mind as it is, most people 
would have a panic attack. 
 
 
If you doubt me, then go to Peru and take the magic brew called Iowaska, 
which will deconstruct every single thing you’ve got going for you and they’ll 
all happen independent of each other and it is pure terror until you figure out 
how to deal with this thing.

The metacognition is just the fact that you’re aware of sensory experience, 
which is part of the bigger framework of cognition but without the risk of 
putting extra thoughts on top of it. 
 
 
So, we’re not looking at it in the constrained form of thinking about thinking. 
We’re looking at the larger picture, which is thinking about your subjective 
experience. Let’s put it that way. Does that help? 
 
Winfried: Yes, so you’re basically taking the breathing as a physical metaphor to learn 
about when you think that you’re… 
 
Igor: 
And then when you get to the advance practice – this is why the classic 
Buddhist meditation has only got three things. You start with mindfulness 
breathing, which gets your attention sorted out, although it’s done in a very 
difficult way.  
 
 
Then you go to the inside meditation, which is the body scan that we’ll come 
onto later at the end of the week, and that’s your main practice. Then they 
have like a rounding off practice to do with meta and loving kindness and so 
on, which takes all that energy, which is basically meaningless, and gives it a 
healthy meaning. 
 
 
Those are the essential three maneuvers. I’m not a Buddhist scholar and I’m 
not going to pretend that I know all the different things. Go to a Buddhist to 
study that. I’m deconstructing the process as a hypnotist knowing what I 
know about the mind and neuroscience and all that sort of stuff. Does that 
make sense? 
 
 
So, the beauty about the breathing is it collects your attention, which is our 
currency. You can’t buy anything in the world in a mind without attention, 
and it does it in a relatively simple way so that you don’t get over-stressed by 
it, even though as we’ve already found out it can get pretty taxing just doing 
that, and importantly you’re not telling yourself stories about it. 
 
 
That’s an extra layer that you don’t have to remove now. If you try to keep 
track of your thoughts only, you’ll start having thoughts about those thoughts 
and thoughts about the thoughts about the thoughts, and the recursion gets 
very difficult to control.

Whereas with breathing, it is essentially meaningless other than there’s a 
biological process, but it’s still part of your sensory experience and so on, so 
you get to control that.  
 
 
Then when you come onto other things like terror, you don’t start letting your 
story machine inside your mind go wild on it and blame it on others and 
people doing things wrong and so on. You just realize oh that’s another 
experience that I don’t need to do anything with, and that’s where the control 
comes in. Does that help a little bit? 
 
 
Now a lot of things to a certain extent we’re jumping the gun a little bit 
because we’ve only started opening the door to the mindfulness practice, and 
we will build more on this as we continue. I just have to move very slowly not 
because you’re not capable of doing more. It’s because we need to share a 
vocabulary. 
 
 
If I move too quickly, we’ll fudge boundaries and then what I ask you to do 
will not be what you end up doing, so the lesson gets lost and what we’re 
trying to achieve can’t get achieved anymore because you’re off somewhere 
else. It’s not that it’s not valuable. It just won’t get you what we’re going to be 
doing here. 
 
Student: One thing that I came across with mindfulness recently that I thought was 
useful for me anyways was the concept of attending to the new in the same 
way that paying attention to normal day-in and day-out breathing can be 
very, very boring by either paying attention to how you breathe differently 
each and every time and whatever sense of subtlety you may have. 
 
Igor: 
This goes right back to the nuances. What’s different about that? You’ve 
made a task more difficult. Now the interesting thing is by adding a layer, 
what you’ve essentially done there is you’ve lifted yourself out of boredom. 
The problem is with someone who hasn’t got your experiences. They may pop 
into anxiety like it’s all new! It’s all crazy! I can’t keep track of it all because it’s 
too much. 
 
 
All I’m trying to say is there’s nothing wrong with that. In fact that’s a very 
valuable and useful practice because it adds difficulty to the task, which 
means that your skill level progresses and you need something like that.

It’s like when we talked with DeeDee about how expert meditators can feel 
each individual tip and portion of that tip, in which hair on their chest – if they 
have hair on their chest because some don’t – is moving. What they’re doing 
is they’re increasing the difficulty to stay in that zone, that flow state. That’s 
another wonderful way of doing it, but don’t do it if it’s too much for you. 
Obviously it’s not for you, so that’s where your zone is. Does that make 
sense?  
 
 
Hopefully, you’re beginning to get a sense now that in terms of mindfulness 
practice; it can be an infinite variety. We’re going to focus on the breathing 
partly because it’s a nice tradition because of the threshold we talked about 
and it will allow us to share a vocabulary with that, but it is not necessary.  
 
 
You can do mindfulness with any activity where your mind is involved, where 
you have senses involved, whether it’s thoughts or other things. It’s just by 
learning to do it with this you can extrapolate and do it with anything else, 
including the habitual walking. 
 
 
Instead of just walking – this is another mindfulness meditation – walking 
mindfully, but walking mindfully more than three steps is bloody hard to do 
for exactly the same reason as following more than five breaths is hard to do. 
Instead of getting frustrated that you can’t do what should be a simple task, 
people don’t appreciate that our subjective experience is actually a very 
difficult task to metacognize, especially because as a culture it’s atrophied.  
 
 
This is the equivalent of taking someone at birth, tying them to a wheelchair, 
tying their legs up so they never use them and 20 years down the line or 30 
years down the line – whatever your age group happens to be right now – you 
say okay let’s take straps off and now walk. 
 
 
The muscles atrophied. They have no sense of balance. Their basilar system 
hasn’t connected to their legs. Everything about walking is difficult for them. If 
anyone here has had an accident where you had to learn to walk again, you 
will understand what I mean. 
 
 
Walking is a difficult task to do. It is downright almost impossible. It is a very 
hard thing to do but you’ve been doing it for so long that it seems easy, but 
that is an illusion that your mind has created because it’s habituated 
everything else.

The same thing will happen with the introspective stuff we’re doing. In 
particular now we’re building the metacognition muscle, which is one of your 
safety valves. There’s no point doing these wonderful intense visualizations 
and all the other stuff if your mind can’t cope with it. It doesn’t get any value 
out of it. 
 
 
As long as you understand what you’re doing with it, I don’t care how you do 
it, whether it’s through the sound meditation or watching movement or 
paying attention to your breathing or paying attention to the growling in your 
stomach. I don’t care. It’s all valid as long as you’re doing it with 
metacognition.  
 
 
A boxer needs a punching bag. Not because he wants to go around punching 
bags. He’s not going to have to fight in a ring with a bag. It’s a tool to allow 
him to sharpen other tools that will then serve him when he actually needs 
them. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Being aware of your breathing is not important. It’s the muscle that you’re 
developing whilst being aware of your breathing. That’s the important part. 
We’ve done very slow progressions so far just so that we are on the same 
map and we’re talking about the same things so that you understand the 
same nuances. Does this make sense? 
 
 
 
We haven’t even touched on the mindfulness thing properly yet, but at least 
we know where to go with it now. Would that be fair to say?  
 
Integration Breathing (Sitting) 
 
Igor: 
I’d like you to do one last exercise before the break, again to do with 
mindfulness to take it one step further because I want you to experience this 
attentional dam that we talked about in action. 
 
 
We’re going to do two styles of mindfulness breathing, one that you’re 
already familiar with and people who meditate will be familiar with; and the 
other one which most meditators won’t be familiar with, except that they do 
it without realizing it. It will all make more sense when we discuss it. 
 
 
Here’s all I’m going to ask you to do. I’d like for you to follow your breath just 
as you did a moment ago. If your number was five, then five is the number 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
83 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you go for. If your number was 10, then 10 is the number you go for. If 10 was 
boring, go for 20, add some nuance to it. It doesn’t really matter. You get 
where we’re going with this, right? 
 
 
So, you’re going to start with a sense of breathing that’s metacognizant. 
You’re going to count. You’re going to be aware and so on. Once you reach 
your number, stop trying to do anything. Basically do the mental equivalent of 
coasting. 
 
 
Those of you who have a car with gears, when you take the car out of gear it 
just kind of rolls on its own. It’s called coasting, right? Do the mental 
equivalent. Do not attempt to do anything in particular. This is what 
meditators will be more familiar with, but this is why this practice is difficult 
because I don’t think people understand this as much. We’ll just call this 
sitting with it.  
 
 
So, you do your breathing and you continue to let your breathing do whatever 
it is, and you do as little as possible for 20 or 30 seconds or however long the 
time is.  
 
 
Then when you feel that it is satisfying enough, just open your eyes and come 
back. That period of time will be different for each of you. Some will go 30 
seconds. For others it will last a minute or two. In time it will last a half hour, 
an hour and sometimes even days or so, and that’s when we’ll get to the 
really big stuff but right now, baby steps. 
 
 
Do you understand the nature of the task? You will follow your breathing 
attentively, mindfully in the sense of metacognition, for whatever level of 
breaths was successful to you last time, whatever the number you found was. 
 
 
At the end of that process, you let your mind go and let it go whatever it 
wants and just sit with it. Just be aware of your breathing loosely without 
trying to do anything in particular. That’s the only task that you’re doing. We’ll 
discuss it and then we’ll have a break. Whenever you’re ready, start off. 
 
 
First of all let me ask you this. Who enjoyed that little mini meditation you 
just did? Put your hands up. Who found it easy to do? Put your hands up.  
 
 
Who found that when you stopped counting your breathing, keeping a loose 
awareness of your breathing was actually really easy to do, it just kind of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

hovered there anyway and occasionally you got distracted but you just 
bounced back to your breathing as soon as the tram passed by or whatever it 
was? Put your hands up. 
 
 
Do you know why I stopped that little mini exercise you just did there? 
Because you’d been doing it for two minutes, twice as long as the hard 
version you started with. In fact the shortest amongst you – because a couple 
of you opened your eyes earlier than that – did it for a minute and a half. That 
was the shortest amount of time you did it in and it was easy, wasn’t it? 
 
 
Was it enjoyable? Did you feel a general sense of wellbeing? That general 
glow of wellbeing is called the flow state. Why was it easy? Because your 
initial breaths, which were not too demanding – if you were a five-count 
breather, you did five counts and not six. If you were two, you went for two. It 
doesn’t matter.  
 
 
The thing is you collected your attention with the metacognition, the willful 
act of following your breathing to a point where your mind can naturally 
handle. You dammed up all the attention.  
 
 
We’ll do a little exercise after the break maybe about this. You’ve created a 
predisposition. You’ve warmed up. It’s natural to keep going like that. Has 
anyone here ever run on a treadmill? What happens when you turn the 
treadmill off? Don’t your legs want to still keep going? 
 
 
That’s what you’re experiencing. It is the afterglow of the attentional exercise 
continuing to glow. It’s continuing to move your attention unconsciously back 
to the breathing where you want it to be, back to the flow.  
 
 
This is traditionally known as sitting meditations, but the problem with sitting 
meditations is that people fall asleep because they’re just sitting. How are you 
sitting is a more important question that I’m asking myself. Does that make 
sense to you? 
 
 
So, you have effortlessly doubled the time that you can meditate by 
understanding the task that you’re engaged in, and then reaping the rewards 
of the side effect of engaging in that task – the task being counting your 
breathing and the side effect being mindful of your breathing effortlessly.

Wasn’t that a pleasant experience, folks? Doesn’t that beat damn it I forgot it 
again, what am I doing? Did you have any problems around those areas? 
People who normally fall asleep meditating, please put your hands up. Those 
of you who normally fall asleep meditating, did you fall asleep then? No. 
 
 
Are you beginning to get a sense of a small amount of control inside your own 
mind? I understand it’s only small but it is a very clear representation of 
where you can be as you practice this. It should give you also a very clear 
delineation of the path to take to get to it. 
 
 
Now the beautiful thing is that as a result of the training you’re doing right 
now, you will have other side effects that we haven’t even touched on yet 
that will be of great value to you, one of which of course is the prefrontal 
cortex, the nine core functions that are involved there, which are stabilizing 
and can be called mental health, will tend to grow. 
 
 
These are all side effects whilst you’re building the skill of metacognition, 
which will allow you to navigate your mind at will as you need or wish it to. 
So, there are a lot of skills you’re learning but in a very small dose right now 
because we can’t have the cool exciting things until we get control of our own 
minds. This is how we do it. 
 
 
Who enjoyed that? Who feels like they’ve learned something of great value 
now just from that point alone? Let’s have some questions and answers 
before we have a break. Do you have any questions or comments about your 
experiences? 
 
Student: I’m getting a bit confused about the breathing thing. I do quite a bit of self-
hypnosis and I’m to the point where I take five breaths and I’m sleeping. Now 
this is a lot longer. Should one breathe longer when they go into self-
hypnosis? 
 
Igor: 
The reason we called this seminar Beyond Self-Hypnosis is in part to try to 
sideline the kind of self-hypnosis practice you’re used to because they don’t 
speak to what we’ll be doing here.  
 
 
You’ll be able to achieve exactly the same things you achieve with self-
hypnosis using these tools once we get used to the slightly different way of 
working with things, and you’ll be able to achieve a heck of a lot more 
because you bypass all the limitations in self-hypnosis.

However, please don’t try to connect the two up at this point because the 
things that help you succeed in one approach – in other words the mental 
skills you’ve developed to become a successful self-hypnotist – have 
limitations built into them that we’re trying to currently bypass to go beyond. 
 
 
So, carry on with your self-hypnosis practice. It’s a wonderful practice and I 
still do it. For the things it’s good for, it will be fantastic. Do this practice as a 
separate beast shall we say, a separate creature which will give you additional 
skills that will let you move far beyond what self-hypnosis will allow you to do. 
Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, that helps a lot. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Are there any other comments or questions on what you’ve been 
learning or doing? In that case, it appears I’ve done my job well.

DVD 3 – Mindful Mentalizations & Accessing 
Your Inner World 
 
 
Recap And Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back again. How is everyone doing? Did you have a satisfying lunch? 
Did you have a mindful lunch? Did you taste every bite, or did you taste the 
first few and say that’s enough for now and now I’m going to enjoy the rest of 
the meal? 
 
 
Let’s have a microphone ready. Let’s do a little Q&A session in case you want 
to catch up with questions since the lunch break. Before we go into the Q&A 
session, I just want to recap a little bit about what we’ve been doing so far.  
 
 
In the very first session this morning, we kind of set the parameters for the 
trainings, so you know what to expect and why we’re doing the things that 
we’re doing.  
 
 
Then importantly we began to look at some very simple exercises or tricks 
shall we say that will teach you how to stabilize your mind for the kind of 
work we want to be doing, the kind of inner voyages we want to be taking in 
due course.  
 
 
We discovered these three keys: 
 
1. Closing your eyes. 
2. Describing things either out loud or with the internal dialog. 
3. Pantomiming. 
 
 
These three things help you incredibly in terms of mentalizing any kind of 
process inside. Would that be fair to say? That’s the beginning foundation of 
the ASH Method, but then we spent the next session looking at what is 
actually a relatively well-established industry – the mindfulness/meditation 
industry.

Hopefully I haven’t said anything particularly new. I haven’t taught you any 
new methods for meditating, and I couldn’t because I’m not the expert in 
meditation as such. This is not my specialty.  
 
 
I haven’t been a monk for 10 years, but knowing what we do know about the 
way the mind works, we can apply those very same lessons to meditation, so 
we can discover why does it go wrong for so many people and how can you 
make it go right more easily than most people make their life? 
 
 
You always see in meditation fields that the initial hurdle basically gets rid of a 
ton of people – most people in fact – and those people that get past that 
initial hurdle, they actually stick with it for a long, long time in their life.  
 
 
There are very few people who fall out of the whole meditation thing – there 
are some of course – but once you get past that initial hurdle, people tend to 
stick with it because they know what they’re doing now. It’s a sense of 
competence. 
 
 
What I’m trying to help you achieve is to develop enough clarity about what 
you’re doing, why you’re doing it and what you’re trying to achieve with it so 
that it’s easy for you to do every step of the way. You’re not trying to do too 
much, frustrating yourself or taxing yourself in a way that’s not going to be 
helpful to you.  
 
 
To recap what the key essential element is, we’re looking to find the flow 
state within the mindfulness practice because that’s what keeps it easy and 
has a reward built in from it.  
 
 
In order to be in the flow state, we need to figure out what are the tasks 
involved in a mindfulness practice and how can we reduce those tasks to 
something so small and easy that it will match your skill level, and then how 
can we start evolving the tasks so that as your skill level increases you don’t 
fall into boredom and then give up because it’s just become dull?  
 
 
You continue your practice but at more refined levels. Because your skill 
increases, you can also increase the difficulty. We’re not doing mindfulness 
practice for the spiritual payoff.  
 
 
By all means do it for the spiritual payoff. It’s a wonderful thing and there are 
a lot of people who have gone down that path, and the stuff that you’re 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
89 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
learning here will help with that process, but I want you to keep it in 
perspective of what its role is within the ASH Method – what we’re practicing 
here. 
 
 
The primary role of mindfulness within that bigger ballpark that we’re playing 
with now is it is the safety mechanisms. It builds the mental muscles you need 
in order to do either more difficult and in some respects psychologically more 
dangerous tasks, where the payoff that we’re looking for is going to come 
from. 
 
 
The mindfulness practice on its own of course will be its own payoff, but 
we’re doing it for other reasons as well. Hence, we’re going to be coming 
backwards and forwards from it, and it’s going to be an integral part of the 
whole practice that we’ll be doing, but I want you to understand what you’re 
doing and why you’re doing it. 
 
 
Then you have a choice whether you follow it for spiritual evolution or you’re 
following it for the neuroscience changes that happen inside your own brain 
architecture, which will allow you to do other things more safety, more easily 
and so on.  
 
 
In terms of everything we’ve covered so far, do you have any comments or 
questions in terms of your experiences or the concepts that we’ve discussed? 
 
Student: I was wondering where the idea of growth comes from stepping outside your 
comfort zone and staying in your flow state, and how those two relate? 
 
Igor: 
Stepping out of your comfort zones for personal growth – and what was the 
second part of that? 
 
Student: And staying in the zone. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s look at the flow state chart again to answer that question. You’ll notice 
that at the top we have anxiety. Basically whenever you get bored, you know 
that you’ve mastered the skills sufficiently that you’re no longer growing.  
 
 
Whenever you begin to feel anxious – which is what the idea of going out of 
your comfort zone means – it doesn’t mean you go into panic. You don’t go as 
far as this is terrifying and I can’t do any of this.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
90 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Remember as we talked about this morning, a small level of anxiety actually 
releases the right amount of neurochemicals to help your brain architecture 
grow. You’ll create connections between neurons more quickly than when 
you have larger levels of stress or a flat emotion or something like that.  
 
 
This idea of a comfort zone is just another way of saying the comfort zone is 
everything below the flow channel. The flow channel and below is the 
comfort zone. As soon as you go outside of your comfort zone, you’re working 
at the low bandwidth of anxiety, which is really where the greatest learnings 
take place. 
 
 
So, if you never got out of your comfort zone, you’re never learning at your 
optimal rate. It doesn’t mean that you can’t progress without leaving your 
comfort zone. You can, because boredom will warn you when you’re doing 
too little, when you’ve grown beyond the point. 
 
 
If you get bored on the other hand, you’re not growing. As soon as you’re 
bored, you have stopped growing as a person. Your brain architecture is not 
changing anymore and you’re no longer assimilating differences inside you 
and so on, so you’re basically just doing the mental equivalent of treading 
water. You’re marking time and getting very little done with it. You’re actually 
devolving in some respects. 
 
 
You’re either moving forwards or you’re moving backwards. Boredom is your 
sign that in that particular field, you’re beginning to devolve. Stress is your 
sign that you’ve taken on too much.  
 
 
Moving out of your comfort zone – in other words going through low levels of 
anxiety, very small amounts of stress, which a lot of people enjoy as a 
challenge – is your sign that you’re working at the optimal level of the optimal 
growth cycle.  
 
 
If you go a little bit beyond that, you get too stressed and it all shuts down. If 
you go a little bit beneath that, you’re still learning and growing but just not 
as fast as you’re capable of. If you go a lot beneath that, you’re back in 
boredom and then nothing’s happening. Are there any other comments or 
questions? 
 
Student: Is self-hypnosis still relevant within this whole program we’re running through 
here? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
That’s a good question. Does self-hypnosis affect what you’re doing here? No. 
They’re two parallel streams in many ways. Where does self-hypnosis fit 
within the context of this? I think of self-hypnosis as the little brother that is 
easy to get along with. 
 
 
So, it’s easy to learn, it’s quicker to learn and you’ll get results more easily and 
more quickly initially with self-hypnosis. The things that self-hypnosis is 
optimal for are fantastic, and I still use it for that because it’s just the quicker 
more effective tool for it. 
 
 
We’re now looking for something much larger. We’re trying to get out of 
Bucket Land especially. Remember that movie Escape From L.A. from way 
back when – or was it Escape From New York, which is an even older version? 
My sci-fi geekiness is coming out again. 
 
 
We’re doing essentially that in here. We’re looking to get out of that limited 
environment. Now in the process can you use this stuff for the stuff self-
hypnosis works for? Absolutely. 
 
 
In other words, everything you can do with self-hypnosis, you can do with this 
process as well, only you’ll be able to do much more also. The downside is, as 
we’re beginning to learn here, initially it requires more time as an investment 
because you’re getting much more particular in terms of what you’re doing 
with your mind. 
 
 
The beauty with self-hypnosis is there are only a couple of very simple skills to 
learn like getting out of your way, somehow switching your intellect off 
enough that the unconscious mind can do it, and then just having a check that 
the unconscious is doing it.  
 
 
That’s a much simpler task than what we’re talking about here. Hence, it’s 
quicker to learn. Self-hypnosis is easier to get started with and it’s easier to 
get results with, but it has a limitation built in.  
 
 
This, if there is a limitation, I don’t know of it yet. I haven’t really gone 
through Bathtub Land enough to find out what’s in the other end. I suspect 
this will get you past Bathtub Land into Swimming Pool country as well, but 
not having gone there yet, I can’t guarantee that.

It will do everything that self-hypnosis will do for you also, but initially it will 
take longer to learn this because there are more working parts in this. Think 
of it this way. It’s like a sundial compared to a pocket watch with all the 
intricate gears inside it. I kind of like that metaphor actually. Cliff, I hope 
you’re listening. 
 
 
Are there any other comments or questions? No?  
 
Mentalize – Mental Tour 
 
Igor: 
So, this morning we started to stabilize our intention. Could you look around 
and choose a partner you’ll be doing some more mentalization exercises with 
in a moment?  
 
 
We know the basic rules of stabilizing, which are: close your eyes, describe 
preferably out loud – but internal dialog works too – and pantomime. Those 
three are quick and easy ways of getting your mind to do what you need it to 
do. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is with your partner, I’d like for you to begin to 
describe a room you’re familiar with, maybe the room that you mentalized 
earlier on. Don’t spend too long, just enough to point out a few details and 
the general orientation, just enough so they know that you’re well oriented 
into that. 
 
 
If you’re like Arthur, you have a lot of details. You don’t have to tell them all 
of it, just enough that you know oh, this is all very clear to me. The key here is 
have you stabilized your mind enough that it’s all clear to you?  
 
 
Once you’ve done that, I would like you to do the next step, go beyond that. 
In other words, walk out of that room and give them a tour of your house. It’s 
a mental tour of your house.  
 
 
In the same way as you describe one room, you can describe various others. 
Of course you’re going to have a lot more clarity internally as to what’s going 
on than you’re going to be describing, because otherwise we’ll be here for an 
hour.

I’ve done various different versions of this exercise, one of which lasted three 
and a half hours. We don’t have that kind of time here today. So, we’re 
looking for a short exercise – two or three minutes, maybe five minutes tops – 
because we’re going to be going both ways, so you have to make a judgment 
call about how much detail do you actually describe, as opposed to how much 
you’re actually experiencing. 
 
 
You’ll experience much more than you’ll be able to describe, and that typically 
is the case with any kind of mental experience. There’s a lot more going on 
than your ability to describe it, or at least it may take you hours to describe 
minutes of an experience if you’re doing it properly.  
 
 
You’re going to basically extend your ability to mentalize from one room to 
your whole household giving someone a tour. I want you to notice what 
things are working easily and well in your mentalizations, what things surprise 
you within that mentalization and in particular the surprises because we need 
to talk about them afterwards. Just give them basically an extended tour of 
your home. 
 
 
If you don’t want them to know what your home looks like in case they’re 
burglars, choose someone else’s home that you’ve burglarized enough that 
you know the layout. 
 
 
Let’s restrict ourselves to five rooms in whatever place you’re in. If your 
apartment doesn’t have five rooms then just five areas. Let’s say you live in a 
studio apartment which basically has a bathroom, the bed and the kitchenette 
area. That’s three simple areas and I’m sure you get the picture here. 
 
 
Again, as with other things, I don’t care about the exactness of it. What I care 
about is what your mind is doing in order to be able to do this, so we can talk 
about that later. Do you all understand the nature of the exercise? We have a 
question over here. 
 
Student: Are we describing with our mouth and then mentalizing it? 
 
Igor: 
No, it’s all synchronous. You’re going to basically describe it as you’re doing it. 
Pick a continent – South America, North America, Europe. Europe, okay fine, 
go to Europe.

So, I’m going to go to my grandmother’s house because that was fun. It’s 
been a while since I’ve been there. I’m going to start off in my grandfather’s 
room, which became a spare bedroom and it was also an office.  
 
 
So, we have the desk over here with the phone. Next to the phone is an old 
baker light, we had this counter, which my grandmother plugged in, she had a 
guest house and we could see how much time people spent on the phone, so 
we know what to charge them.  
 
 
There’s a table in the middle – and of course all these things no longer exist 
because the house has been sold, so this is me in memory rather than the 
existence. Anyway there’s a table in the middle, which is nicely inlaid with 
different patterns of wood, and there’s a little doily with a vase of flowers in 
the middle. 
 
 
In the corner over here we have the bed. It’s a single bed. It’s got like a red 
rough blanket on it. There’s a lot more detail I could tell you here, but I’d be 
spending too long in here. Instead, I’m going to go out the door, which is over 
here. The wall is there with the desk here and the bed’s here. The door is right 
over here. 
 
 
There’s another door. That’s my grandmother’s room, but you’re not going in 
there. So, we go into the corridor now. It’s a nice long thin corridor. The first 
off to the left goes to the kitchen. Then there’s a bathroom over here. Then 
there’s another kind of a door which looks like a cupboard, but it’s actually a 
secret door that goes up to the attic.  
 
 
Then there’s another door on the far left-hand corner that goes into the 
dining room and then some long stone steps going down towards the – it 
depends on how you count. This is either the third floor or the second floor 
depending on if you count the ground floor as the first floor, which of course 
in Europe you do. 
 
 
So, it’s a long corridor and there’s a big mirror with kind of a black wood and 
it’s carved in kind of a twisted spiral with the mirror across it, and there’s a 
chest of drawers or something in front of that.  
 
 
Opposite that we have a long, long, long rack of coats and stuff – and there 
are a lot of them because there are a lot of people in the house. The floor has 
these huge flagstones, some are red and some are grey, and they’ve been

worn smooth. This has been around for hundreds of years, so they’ve been 
worn smooth with people walking on it.  
 
 
There’s a red carpet that’s made of a rough sort of material, but it’s all going 
down the centerline. Then we go into the kitchen. Do you see how this is 
starting to take up some time? That’s kind of the process I’m going to ask you 
to do. 
 
 
I don’t need you to do more. Five minutes is really the maximum, but I only 
want you to have a couple of minutes. The key is you’re expanding your 
mentalization abilities in a way that we’ll talk about afterwards.  
 
 
Do you all understand the exercise now? There’s a question – is it five minutes 
in total or is it five minutes apiece? Let’s stick to this as a pair being five 
minutes because otherwise, we’ll run out of time and the time is going to be 
relatively loose. 
 
 
Here’s your measurement. Once you’ve had a satisfying experience of going 
to at least three locations, then you’d make the choice whether you carry on 
for a little bit longer or not. Just don’t carry on too long, so the other person 
gets a chance to do it too. Easy to do? Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’ll describe my kitchen – or my friend’s kitchen actually who I lived with 
throughout the summer. So, I’ll start with that. As you know, when you enter 
the kitchen you have the fridge and the freezer and on top of the fridge is the 
toaster and the water boiler and stuff like that, but I described that room for 
you quite well, so I guess we’ll continue out into the hallway. 
 
 
A tiled hallway with tiles and if we turn to our left, we’ll go to the master 
bedroom and when we enter the master bedroom, it’s wooden floor, a big 
rug, a desk to the right with three bookshelves above it and a double bed. 
That’s pretty much all you can tell about that.  
 
 
If you go back into the hallway and take a left when you go outside, you come 
to another bedroom and there’s a wooden floor there as well and a big rug. 
The bed is to the side, some bookshelves, another desk.

On the desk is some kind of stereo equipment and you head back to the 
hallway and go to the living room, there are bookshelves on the left-hand side 
roughly the height of – I don’t know – not that big, but there’s a long table 
next to it with the – pardon? 
 
Student: Can you visualize it? 
 
Student: I can, and there are eight chairs around the long table and also there’s a 
wooden floor. There’s a sofa, a green sofa and a table in front of it. 
 
Student: Let me pause you there. Just picture that. Discover. 
 
Student: Something about the rug that I haven’t – something that changed in the room 
that I wasn’t anticipating. The table in front of the sofa is brown but I can’t 
really picture the rug. 
 
Student: Just hold that and pause there. 
 
Igor: 
All right, welcome back again. How was that? Was that interesting? First of all 
let me ask you who enjoyed that experience? Hands up. I’m not surprised 
given the amount of laughter and giggling and emotions coming through.  
 
 
Compare what you just did to the previous attempt – not necessarily today 
but in your previous life – to visualize anything, whether it was a guided 
visualization or it was to visualize a technical drawing or whatever it was. 
 
 
Which one was easier – what you did today just now, or the way you tried to 
visualize things in the past? This is the interactive part. Today? Which one had 
the most clarity – in other words which ones were you able to perceive most 
clearly inside of your mind, whether it was visually, or kinesthetically, or 
auditorily or probably a mixture of all three – what you did you today or the 
past visualizations you attempted in the past? Today? 
 
 
Was it the same for you guys? You probably had an elevated skill already. 
We’re just bringing people up to that level here. We need to make sure that 
we have that contrast and explain what’s happening at these different levels. 
 
 
Why was it so much easier than attempts to visualize have been in the past? 
Special attention? Familiar?

Student: We’ve grown up with each of us having a different perception of what 
visualization really is, and when you used the word mentalism earlier, it put 
aside all those preconceptions. Whilst I’ve always considered myself to be 
from the NLP world a visual person, I tried to put all that aside and use what 
you taught us this morning, and I found it so much easier to do the exercise 
than had you not explained that from a mentalization point of view. 
 
Igor: 
It’s one of the reasons we use different words, so that you don’t have it 
tainted with all the associations, absolutely. 
 
Student: A different label. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly and there’s a little bit more going on than just a different label. That 
frees you up to do what comes naturally. What does that word natural mean 
anyway? It means it is a function that your mind is already skillful at.  
 
 
Some things we call natural have taken a long time to acquire – in other 
words to learn and practice, like walking. Other things we call natural are just 
part of our instinctual brain mechanisms that we’re born with.  
 
 
One of these natural things that we’re actually born with is a whole part of 
the brain that is designed specifically for mapping out spatial locations. The 
men in the audience will have a slight advantage over women.  
 
 
It’s not always the case but in terms of the brain architecture, men tend to 
have that spatial locator ability more profoundly developed. Of course there 
are exceptions to the rule. There are some guys who get lost in their own 
bathroom and vice versa.  
 
 
Women have other talents that will kind of compensate on that level, but all 
of us fundamentally as human beings need to be able to locate ourselves in 
space. Otherwise we’d be complete failures in this version of reality. Space 
makes an impression upon us automatically. 
 
 
So, why not start with what is already there? How do you know where the 
bathroom is in your house? It’s because your mind had to make a map of your 
house to tell you where the bathroom is and how to get from A to B. In other 
words, you’ve already succeeded unconsciously with it.

Are you aware that when you want to go pee for example that your mind is 
automatically creating a mental route from the living room through the 
kitchen or through wherever else you need to go through to get to your 
bathroom?  
 
 
No, you’re so efficient at it and so automatic at it that you have no mental 
cognition, no awareness that it’s actually going on but it’s a very natural 
function. You need it to be able to survive in this world. So, we just tapped 
into that. 
 
 
By asking you to give us mental tour of your house, we’re asking you to do 
something you have already done over and over and over again. If I asked you 
to give me a mental tour of a house you’ve only been to once, that would be a 
lot more difficult to do.  
 
 
It’s still not impossible and in fact in time if you choose to make this into a 
memory organizing thing, it becomes very easy to walk into a place once and 
instantly know where everything is, but that requires training. 
 
 
In the absence of that kind of training, just go with your default. If you’re in a 
room often enough, if you’re in a location often enough, you will just get to 
know it and in order to get to know it, you have to have created a mental 
model of that external reality to be able to navigate through it.  
 
 
Do you understand what I mean by that? Really all you’ve done is you’ve 
made what was unconscious – the mental model – conscious. So, guess what? 
At a very low level you’ve already succeeded at the fundamental task that we 
want to do in the ASH Method, which is to get access to unconscious material. 
 
 
Now it’s not useful to us yet. I understand that. We’re not even close to 
making this practical yet, but I want you to understand what you just 
experienced going on. 
 
 
Something else occurred, which was different this time to the mentalizations 
that we did this morning, and that is you added something into it. Who here 
added emotion? Who here actually walked around their house? Hands up. I 
fully expected that to happen. 
 
 
Did I ask you for emotion? No. You could have very easily have done the 
exercise by being in the bedroom now, being in the kitchen now, being in the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
99 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
hallway now and just being there, but you didn’t do that. Why? This again is a 
fundamental premise in any kind of mental work you want to do. 
 
 
We understand our internal reality only by reference to our external reality. If 
someone has a problem, you go up to them and say it’s just not worth it, let it 
go. What the heck are they hanging onto?  
 
 
Is the problem in their hand? No. It’s the equivalent of saying why are you 
carrying that rock around in your hand, let it go. But it’s so heavy. Well, then 
open your hand and let it go. You don’t have to carry it around anymore.  
 
 
Can you hear these metaphors in your everyday life? Because our external 
reality is so stable and because we are constantly interacting with it – in other 
words practicing working with it – our external reality very quickly becomes a 
metaphor for our internal reality. 
 
 
So, even though you could have just been in the five different rooms, you 
walked through it because that’s natural to you. That’s how you understand 
everyday processes. In other words, you’ve created a symbolic landscape that 
matches onto a real landscape, and you’re navigating it using the ways you 
know how to navigate the real landscapes.  
 
 
In time you’ll be able to go beyond the physical limitations in the symbolic 
landscapes, but for now why do something that’s difficult? Why not do what’s 
easy? Do you understand where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Who found that mentalizing pretty much the whole house and doing a little 
tour of it was actually very easy and straightforward to do? Who found odd 
moments of clarity, like little details you didn’t even know would be there but 
when you walked past them they just happened to be there? Hands up. 
 
 
What do you think is going on there? Flow would be one of the reasons for it, 
but what do you think is going on? Why is that happening? It’s information 
coming from your unconscious. It’s things that you weren’t even consciously 
aware of.  
 
 
Even though you know how your house is constructed, if someone asked you 
where is the bowl with the apples in it, you’d say let me think. Of course what 
are you doing right now? You’re consciously diving into unconscious territory 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
100 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
to navigate your unconscious map until you find the location where the bowl 
is and you say oh it’s in the bathroom, that’s where I left it yesterday.  
 
 
But that’s the hard way to do it. Just now all you did is you walked through 
your mental environment and your unconscious mind makes offers – form 
here something, form here something else, here’s something else. You’re 
spontaneously creating additions and these additions happen to match 
reality, but they don’t have to. 
 
 
The carpet that I saw in my grandmother’s house – does it still exist? It’s 
probably been torn up and buried in some landfill years ago when the house 
got sold, I imagine. Does the bed still exist? It probably went the same way. 
Does the cover still exist? It probably went the same way, or maybe it’s been 
given to charity and some little old lady is now wrapped up in it. That’s my 
grandfather’s blanket. How could I see it in my mind if it doesn’t exist 
anymore? It’s because it doesn’t exist out there. It only exists in here. 
 
 
Where that blanket exists, other things will also exist that have no bearing on 
the external reality that mean a whole bunch of things to you as a person. 
This is how we start getting out of Bucket Land, but we’re not there yet. 
 
 
Who here is getting a sense that something important is starting to develop 
here? You’re learning to control your internal environment by using things 
that you’re already used to in everyday life.  
 
 
Someone here mentioned earlier on that they’re staying in a hostel around 
the corner. Can you just put your hand up a second? I’ll make you a promise, 
and tomorrow you can tell us if I’m right or not.  
 
 
When you walk into the hostel again tonight, especially if you’ve given people 
a mental tour of the hostel beforehand, as soon as you walk in you’ll see it 
more clearly than you’ve ever seen it before, and when you come back and 
tell us about it tomorrow, you’ll remember more things than you even 
thought you noticed today.  
 
 
We’ll see if I’m right tomorrow. Would that be a nice experiment to run? Once 
again for your unconscious mind, there is no difference between external and 
internal reality.

You have to add a little extra tag onto it so that you can tell the difference 
between what’s going on in here and going on out there, so people out there 
don’t think you’re crazy, which means going another step now. These are kind 
of the layers of the onion cake unfolding – or is it beginning to sound a little 
bit like that movie Inception? 
 
 
I’ll tell you this now but don’t get worried about this particular thing. Some of 
the students that I run through the beta program of this at one point or 
another lost track of external reality.  
 
 
They didn’t know if they were still actually thinking about it or actually 
experiencing it. It was very difficult for a moment, which is why some of the 
mindfulness comes back in to help ground you again afterwards. We’ll get 
some more elaborate practice for that later on today, but I need you to 
understand this. 
 
 
The only way you know what’s going on in here versus out there is because 
your mind has added a little something to it to make the distinction so you 
can function out there. Otherwise you’d be labeled a psychotic.  
 
 
A psychotic really has two problems. One is that he can’t tell the distinction 
between what’s going on in here and what’s going on out there, and the other 
problem is whatever that happens to be tends to be frightening. He doesn’t 
know how to deal with that frightening part of that imagery.  
 
 
I’ll give you an example of a psychotic episode that is most useful. This is a 
Milton Erickson story. Milton Erickson, for those of you who don’t know, was 
a psychiatrist who was probably one of the world’s greatest hypnotists. He 
was a phenomenal man. 
 
 
A woman shows up and she’s a psychotic, but she’s a functional psychotic. 
She can hold down a job, she’s married, etc. She shares with him whatever 
she does, but long story short she likes taking little holidays in her private 
kingdom under the sea, only it takes so long to get there that she sometimes 
misses a week from work and then she keeps getting fired. She doesn’t like 
that. 
 
 
So, Erickson teaches her time distortion. Now she can go spend a week 
getting there, spend a week there enjoying her subjects and having fun and 
then spend another week coming back all in about a minute of clock time. So, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
102 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
she sits at her desk, she’s frustrated and she says screw all of you, I’m going 
on holiday. Oh, you’re still here? 
 
 
Subjectively it felt like weeks and she had the full glorious experience of being 
on that wonderful holiday trip and so on. Is that a wonderful skill to have? If 
you speak to some psychiatrists, they’ll put you on medication.  
 
 
Do you understand now what we’re talking about here? We need to have 
things that are functional. We don’t want to start putting arbitrary labels onto 
this whether it’s healthy or unhealthy. What matters is, is it working for you, 
in which case knock yourself out. Do more of it. 
 
 
If it’s not working for you, then we need to figure out ways of how to make it 
work for you, how to change it in some way that’s useful to you. Make sense? 
Again, do you understand the importance of the mindfulness practice as a 
grounding experience to get more of a sense of which reality you’re working 
with right now? 
 
 
Over to you guys. Are there any comments or questions in terms of your 
experience?  
 
Student: I wanted to mention my experience only because it points out the power of 
the unconscious mind. So, when you said do the whole house versus a room, 
my mind kind of said oh I don’t have to pay attention to detail as much. So, 
listened to what happened. 
 
 
So, as I was going through the rooms, I wasn’t present or mindful, so I wasn’t 
taking my partner on a tour with every detail. The information was coming up 
but I noticed at some points I wasn’t seeing it, and the reason I noticed I 
wasn’t seeing it is because the times I did see it, my unconscious was so 
familiar with the old decorating that I realized that I wasn’t mindful because 
the old Chesterfield kept coming up in the room that had been transformed 
into a bedroom, and I thought whoa, what does this mean? 
 
Igor: 
You’re working an old pattern. 
 
Student: Yes, exactly.

Igor: 
It’s an old habit, an old map and that’s just fine. My grandmother’s house is 
no longer like it was, and I can still use it as a valuable tool, as a resource to 
help train my mind in other ways.  
 
 
What you just discovered is another aspect of the metacognition by becoming 
aware of your awareness. Now you’re not aware of your breathing. You’re 
aware of the mental maps your mind has made of your house. Now you have 
two sets of maps – the old house and the new house. 
 
Student: But the lack of mindfulness or being present in the moment… 
 
Igor: 
You go to a default. 
 
Student: It just reverted back to the old. 
 
Igor: 
You always go back to a default. When you’re not mindful, you’ll default back 
to what’s customary. If customary is good, that’s fine. But if customary is not 
good, if customary is eating that extra slice of cheesecake let’s say, or if it’s 
customary to get angry with someone who has upset you or who’s cut in front 
of you and so on, then you’re stuck and you’re not a human being anymore 
because you’re not making choices.  
 
 
You’re stuck at default. The world can push your buttons and you’re just a 
robot at that point. Mindfulness elevates your outer robot reality into true 
choice again but it’s a subtle thing and you just noticed it.  
 
 
Is it bad to see the old Chesterfield in the old room? No, for this exercise it’s 
absolutely perfect. You had an extra bonus out of that because you also 
realized there’s a tag here.  
 
 
How did you know that the Chesterfield is no longer there if you didn’t have 
an alternative map where it’s not there anymore, and that updated map has a 
different mental tag somewhere that your unconscious mind recognizes as 
now versus usual?  
 
 
Eventually now become usual and that’s what will come out of that. Do you 
see where we’re going with this? This is again a very subtle point, isn’t it? If 
we had described it to you, you wouldn’t be able to understand it because we 
don’t have the language for it, but having experienced it we can give it a label 
– that little mental tag thing – and suddenly the experience is much more real.

Thank you for that. I appreciate that. Are there any other comments?  
 
Student: So far this hasn’t been too radically different for me. I’m a screenwriter, so 
I’ve been doing exactly what you – I have emotion going because when you 
write or you create a movie, you’re looking through the eye of your camera, 
and so you’re either zooming in or zooming out, and you’re walking through a 
particular space because that’s where you’re guiding the audience’s attention. 
 
Igor: 
But you have to train that, right? 
 
Student: Yes.  
 
Igor: 
So, you’ll find most of the exercises that we’ll be doing very easy until we get 
to the point where we actually start using them and that will blow your mind. 
You have the strength there already, but you’re the equivalent of an acrobat 
who’s physically very strong and flexible and so on and you just haven’t 
learned that you can do this stuff outside of the circus too. 
 
 
Again, notice how we’re using our everyday reality to strengthen muscles. 
Other people who can do this stuff easily are people like architects. They have 
to visualize rooms before they exist. Interior designers have to be able to 
mentalize the way it will look when you match different things together and 
so on. 
 
 
Certain activities will naturally lend themselves more towards this, but I don’t 
care. All I care about is what is the activity in everyday life that will make life 
easy for us to succeed in? Make sense? 
 
 
Let me ask you one last question now. Who here discovered surprising 
elements in their journey through the house, things that they didn’t expect to 
be there? Hands up. Why is this important to us? It shows us a very important 
principle about trusting your unconscious mind. 
 
 
Let’s call this the Law of Reverse Effect. If you tried to make that object that 
surprisingly appeared wherever it was to be there, it would be difficult 
because the wrong part of your mind is doing it.

All you have to do as a conscious mind is show up and have a certain 
intention, although it’s a very weak one in the background. We didn’t set it 
very clearly yet. We’ll work more on intention in due course. 
 
 
 
But all you need to do as a mind is show up and let the unconscious mind fill 
in the rest for you. It gets difficult when you have to try and make it happen. 
Let’s see if we can do this.  
 
 
This will not be a clean experiment because we spent a lot of time building up 
mentalizations, but what I want you to do very quickly now is visualize your 
room in exact detail. Close your eyes and do that. Visualize every single thing 
in the place it belongs in exact detail, and when you’re ready come on back. 
 
 
Who found that difficult to do? Hands up. That’s just under half of the room. 
The reason some of you found it relatively easy to do is because we primed 
the pump so to speak, and you’ve learned how to let go and let it happen.  
 
 
The more you try to make something happen consciously that is not your 
conscious mind’s responsibility, the more you will block the process and it’s 
hard to do. That’s why traditional forms of visualizations are so hard to do 
because you’re not meant to do them that way. 
 
 
The guys who sit there for hours on end visualizing, checking, visualizing, 
checking, visualizing – all that they’re doing is exhausting their conscious mind 
until it gives up and they close their eyes and say there it is at last, but then 
they think about it making sure it happens again and it disappears, and they 
say damn it where did it go?  
 
 
Then they just look at it and think about, look at it and think about it. Then 
there it is again because they got tired. They stopped paying attention and 
stopped interfering with the process. That’s why the traditional methods are 
so difficult. 
 
 
It doesn’t mean you can’t achieve success that way. You can. It will just take 
you a lot longer and you’ll be building a whole bunch of other muscles first, 
including one like patience, which can be very worthwhile doing. 
 
 
We’re learning to work a different way so that we can get the same results 
more quickly, but the dangerous part of that is that we don’t build the 
muscles in quite the same ways, so we need other practices like the

mindfulness to build the muscles we’ll need to safely navigate other 
environments in due course. 
 
 
Does this all make sense to you? Good, because if I had said this to you at the 
start of the day today, you’d all have thought I was nuts, and now we’ll be 
nuts together. 
 
 
So, we like the idea of spontaneity because it’s one of the ways we learn to 
trust the unconscious because you never chose it. It chose you. It just 
appeared for you and that’s how all your mentalization practices will work. 
 
 
Think about what you just did there. All you did in terms of your conscious 
effort is created an intention. You intended to give people a mental tour of 
your home. You have no idea how you did that, do you? You don’t know 
where the pictures came from. You don’t know where that surprising little 
object that you didn’t know was there suddenly appeared out of. 
 
 
In time we’ll add some extra elements onto this, which will really twist your 
brain inside out a little bit, but the point is you show up as a conscious mind 
with an intention, and your unconscious mind delivers whatever you want 
provided you’re not blocking it. 
 
 
The more you do this, the better you become at it. Once you get good at it 
with stuff that’s concrete in your everyday world, then you can start building 
worlds that never existed before and then you can start doing some real good 
work, but we’re not there yet. 
 
Mentalize – Neighborhood Tour 
 
Igor: 
Let’s do another thing. Let’s see if we can expand that idea of a mental map 
and see if we can pull out another nuance that you probably won’t have got 
inside of your home.  
 
 
Not all of you will experience this because some of you are closer to this 
practice already than others, but enough of you should be able to experience 
this that you can see that this is a general principle and it will become more of 
a rule as we go into other territories as well.

What I want you to do this time is the same exercise, but just spend very little 
time inside of your house giving the tour. Just start somewhere and then 
move outside of your house by the shortest route or whatever route you want 
to take.  
 
 
Describe the route, of course. Pantomime the route but I want you to get out 
of your house, and I want you to give whoever your partner is – or if you’re on 
your own pretend there’s a partner there so you can describe it to them 
inside your own mind, because some of you are doing it on your own. 
 
 
I want you to give them a tour of your neighborhood. Walk them down to 
some local landmark – the post office, the park, the bus stop – but again in 
the same manner that you just walked them around your own home.  
 
 
There will be a lot of similarities and there will be some distinctions. There will 
be some differences, and I want to talk about those once you’ve had the 
experience. Do you understand the nature of the exercise?  
 
 
Because we’re doing a little bit more now, please spend a little less time 
hanging around inside your home. I know you like it but I want you to only 
spend enough time inside the home to get the ball rolling, and then head 
outside and see what the outside world looks like to you – or at least to your 
unconscious. 
 
 
All right, once again the time limit is going to be the same sort of time limits 
as before. The main point of course is you should have a satisfying experience 
of it before you switch roles. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I guess we left off in the living room. We can go back to the hallway with 
the tiles and that’s where the front door is, a wide front door. We’ll open the 
door and we’ll get outside in kind of a pathway into the whole house, and 
we’ll have to leave that through a red door and then we’re outside on the 
street. 
 
 
On the street, I guess in my mind it’s not freezing but it’s cold, and I want to 
take a walk down to the convenience store. So, walking on the sidewalk there 
are tram tracks in the road by the sidewalk and there are probably trams 
coming every now and then. 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

On the right-hand side we’ll pass by a barbershop, a rundown old barbershop, 
and then we’ll go through a tunnel. The tunnel is there because of railway 
tracks. It’s kind of dark, no lights in the tunnel, so it’s not that – I mean it’s 
maybe 25 meters or so to walk but you can feel the impact of the darkness 
from the tunnel. 
 
 
Then at some point we have to cross the road and the tram tracks, and on the 
other side of the road there’s a bus stop and also just next to the bus stop 
there are about 20 bicycles that the City of Oslo provides free of charge.  
 
 
When we walk down, we’re getting closer to the convenience store, there are 
usually like trolleys not for the customers but for filling up the groceries, 
trolleys outside.  
 
 
There’s a garbage bin as well, a green garbage bin. Usually one or two persons 
standing outside of the convenience store just hanging around for whatever 
reason, waiting for the tram or whatever. I got the sign from Igor to stop. 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How was that? Was that interesting? Who had some 
surprising experiences there? Who wants to have a little chat about the 
unexpected in that particular exercise?  
 
 
What were the differences between that and walking around your own 
house? Would it be fair to say there were some differences there? Let’s have 
a little chat about what those were. 
 
Student: I was wondering if I was going off script because I kept – there were things 
that I know are there, like dog poop. I told them don’t go over there because 
you’ll step in the dog poop because that’s where all the neighborhood dogs 
poop, and that was surprising to me because I was like turn right, but don’t go 
over by the trees. I was like it’s there but it’s not something tangible.  
 
Igor: 
So, there are details that are coming out once again that you didn’t expect to 
be there. They just happened to be there for you. In other words, it’s one of 
the details that makes something look real. What makes things look real?  
 
 
 
Has anyone here ever read a novel, for example? I’m a big fan of science 
fiction and fantasy novels and so on, and there’s a concept within both of 
those genres that’s called world building.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

The authors that can build a convincing world have little details that convince 
you it’s real. Have you seen The Lord of the Rings to come back to a classic, or 
even read the book? He has thought so meticulously about all the little details 
that belong there that they convince you it’s real.  
 
 
Compare The Lord of the Rings – the movie version – to one of those Robin 
Hood movies where the men are wearing tights and stuff like that. That’s very 
unreal. There are very few details, so you’re unconvinced.  
 
 
Whereas they went to such degrees in The Lord of the Rings that each 
different type of people, each different race had its own look, its own feel, its 
own art, its own types of weapons and so on. Those little details make them 
feel more real. 
 
 
Your environment became more real because of the little details, just enough 
details that convinced you oh this is becoming more real. Let me ask you this. 
When you found the dog poop area and you were surprised like oh my God 
that’s kind of funny and so on, right afterwards how would you describe the 
mentalizations? Did it become more vivid, less vivid or pretty much the same? 
 
Student: More vivid.  
 
Igor: 
More vivid. Did anyone else have that similar experience? As soon as your 
unconscious mind convinces you it’s more real, instantly you’ve given it 
permission back because you’ve been convinced and that creates a trust – I 
trust you now – so you’ve given it feedback saying well done. So, it goes great 
and like a happy little puppy, I’m going to give you more of that.  
 
 
There are times when I do this where I don’t know what country I’m in. I can 
do it in my hotel room and for a while I can be convinced I’m at home with my 
girlfriend and the family, and I expect the dogs to be coming in any moment 
now.  
 
 
Then I open my eyes up and say oh wait a second – and then reality just shifts 
and I’m back here again and I say oh that was a little trippy, and I didn’t take 
anything to make that happen.  
 
 
What else did you notice?

Student: Well, I noticed that when I was in the house, I know it so well that it was very 
simple to do and very easy, but then as I had to go out of the house, first of all 
I had to stop and put leASHes on my dogs, so that was like very important. 
And then, as we were walking through the neighborhood I noticed that there 
are some spots there that normally as I walk through them I’m not paying 
attention to them, so they were very spotty compared to my experience at 
home. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. This is the next point. Did anyone else notice this? The 
essence of that is there are some little details that pop up and make things 
more real for you. Would that be fair to say? But the reverse is also true.  
 
 
There are certain areas which you have blanked over, and when you go there 
it’s kind of fuzzier, greyer and you just kind of move through that. For 
example, if you had to walk down your street if it’s a long street, it might take 
you like a second to take two steps to get from one end to the other end, 
where in reality it might take you five minutes to walk it, but you’re so out of 
it, you’re paying so little attention at that point in time that you just didn’t 
even notice it. 
 
 
It feels like just a couple of steps have taken place, but really it’s just you 
zoning out so that you don’t have to bother with it. Did anyone else have that 
kind of experience where certain areas were patchy in terms of details and 
you didn’t quite get them? 
 
 
This is one of the things your mind does to create the illusion of coherency. If 
you’re walking down a straight road, there’s no need for you to turn left or 
turn right. You don’t have to make any choices on that road.  
 
 
If you have no choices to make, your mind can fade out and the map that’s 
created is very simple, which is go from point A to point B. Everything in 
between is very unimportant. 
 
 
So, you’ll probably vividly recall what the beginning of that route looks like, 
and you’ll probably vividly recall what the end of that part of the route looks 
like but have very little idea what’s going on in the middle because no choices 
are required. Does that make sense? 
 
 
It’s all about where your attention has gone, and that’s another form of 
metacognition now. You now are aware of how your mind processes 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
111 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
unimportant information when you have no conscious involvement, no 
choices to be made. 
 
 
If you want to make those other areas more vivid for you, the hard way is to 
struggle and think about it and say oh I know there’s something there, but 
that’s the hard way to do it. 
 
 
The easy way to do it is to walk down there and say gosh I never knew this 
was here. Oh my goodness there’s something else. Oh my God there’s so 
much stuff here.  
 
 
This is the irony. Since I’ve started doing this work, I’ve made a hobby of 
collecting countries where I go somewhere now by mentally walking through 
these areas. It’s just really to build my mental muscle. I’ve accidentally started 
collecting areas that I didn’t even know I had.  
 
 
Now I can visit all kinds of cool places. I can go to certain parks that I know 
very well. I can visit places vividly in my mind that I’ve been to before because 
my mind’s now filling in the details for me, and those areas that I’m sketchy 
about I’ll say I guess I get to go back there again tomorrow.  
 
 
I don’t try to do anything but details will jump out at me in the real world, just 
like the poop in the dog park jumped out at you in your mental world, and I 
can almost guarantee that those very details that will jump out at me will be 
there the next time I try to visit it again just in my mentalization.  
 
 
This is giving you a clue as to how to enrich your internal landscape.  
 
Perception Is Projection 
 
Igor: 
This goes to another topic. Has anyone here heard the term perception is 
projection? Let me explain a little bit about what we mean by this. 
 
 
Another way to put this is a quaint saying that people don’t see the world as it 
is; they see the world as they are. How do you know what you’re looking at? 
How do you know what’s going on around you? You don’t. This is all an 
illusion that’s going on.

Let’s just look at it in the visual sense. To be in this room and make sense of 
me sitting up in this chair, all that’s happening is light waves are hitting these 
little tiny things in the top of your eyes that we call an eyeball.  
 
 
Actually it’s not even that. It’s just that little black bit in the side of the 
eyeball, a tiny little hole. It’s not getting a lot of light into that, but that tiny 
little hole gets enough light going into it that when the light wave bounces off 
the retina, it sets off a little electric charge. 
 
 
That charge goes up the optical nerve and comes into a little gap. That little 
gap gets jumped over with some chemical. Those chemicals set off another 
little electric charge on the other side, and that process continues until it hits 
your brain. 
 
 
Then inside your brain the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for it. It’s this 
nice little part in the back of the head that we patted earlier on. The occipital 
lobe takes all these chemical/electrical signals and cooks up some magic and 
comes up with some of the parietal lobe understandings of what ought to be 
there.  
 
 
So, you don’t just see a mass of color. You see a person sitting in a chair, 
sitting on a blue stage, etc. There’s a whole complex set of activities that have 
to go on in order for vision to work.  
 
 
If you ask someone who’s into optics, they’ll tell you that one-way vision – in 
other words if you don’t know what the input source is, it’s impossible to see. 
Vision is impossible. In order for your eye to see, it has to make assumptions 
about the light source.  
 
 
That’s why for example when you’re in a fog where the light source is 
different to the assumptions – rather than being a light source from the top 
down from a single universal point, you now have a dispersed equal light 
source around you – it becomes very difficult to judge distances and shapes at 
that point because the assumptions your brains have to make in order to 
understand light have been broken and so it slowly starts deteriorating. 
 
 
Does that make sense? It gets more complex than that. We don’t have to look 
at it. I just want you to understand the main concept of this. So, you don’t 
really know what’s going on in this room. You have a vast amount of little 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
113 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
things going inside your brain that give you an experience, an illusion, a 
hallucination that certain things are going on in this room.  
 
 
That hallucination correlates to whatever kind of reality we can experience 
sufficiently for you to get a sense of I know what’s going on, I can navigate 
through this environment, I can succeed.  
 
 
I’m not going to step in front of a bus because that will kill me, I will eat the 
hamburger because it won’t – unless of course it will. You get the idea. It’s a 
very complex process that the brain makes in a snap. It just creates this 
illusion of the ease of this. 
 
 
What you’re beginning to start seeing now literally in your mentalization 
practice is how that illusion is constructed. Now what does this all have to do 
with the ASH Practice? Okay, this is an interesting phenomenon but unless 
you’re a hardcore psychologist studying perception for example, it should 
mean very little to you. 
 
 
So, why is this of interest to us? It’s because there’s more mental maps going 
on inside our heads than where the bathroom is in our apartment or our 
house. There are mental maps about what things mean. Some of them are 
useful.  
 
 
There’s a bus – it can get you to places. That’s a bus and it’s moving towards 
you quickly. You better get out of the way. They mean certain things that are 
of value and use to you.  
 
 
Some of those things mean things that aren’t of value to you – people don’t 
like me, I’m not attractive, I can’t do this, it’s too dangerous and so on. When 
you look at a scene, you’re actually not seeing the scene.  
 
 
You’re seeing the scene plus the sum total of your life experiences and all the 
conclusions you’ve reasoned from those experiences – or in many cases 
haven’t bothered reasoning from those experiences. That’s an unconscious 
form of reasoning. That’s the Law of Association at work there. 
 
 
So, you will interpret them one way and another person will interpret them 
another way. If I dropped you in the middle of a Rave, a lot of you in the 
slightly older generation would be there and say this is loud, this is noisy, I 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
114 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
hate this, this is like washing machines exploding everywhere, why would 
anyone want to be here? 
 
 
If you throw a teenager into the very same environment, they’d say this is 
crazy. Actually they’d probably use a different word that I don’t know. This is a 
word I don’t know! Yeah! More word I don’t know! More different word that I 
haven’t even heard about yet! 
 
 
It’s because they’re carrying a whole world inside of them and what they see 
out there is reflecting that world and therefore it is good, it is fun. If someone 
who’s not from that generation gets dropped in the same environment, 
they’re also reflecting a world and this world out here with washing machines 
exploding hasn’t got Mozart.  
 
 
What a lonely world that is. If only they just played Mozart and they dimmed 
the lights a little bit, like smoother, and had an armchair, then this Rave would 
be wicked. 
 
 
Of course that’s an amusing example but let’s take a really harsh example of 
that same thing. Two people come out of a concentration camp. One for the 
rest of their life will be fearful, terrified, hate the world and think it’s full of 
mean, ugly, bad people that are out to hurt you.  
 
 
They will be terrified. At every point, they will double check and verify and 
distrust. That’s a very unpleasant life that person has to lead isn’t it? Another 
person comes out and is determined to make the most out of life.  
 
 
They have a second lease on life. They don’t do a job that is soul destroyer. 
Why? Life’s too short. They could end up in this place all over again. Let’s 
make it count what I have left. 
 
 
The exact same experience – one comes out in Hell and the other one comes 
out in Heaven. The experience is not the important thing. It’s what you carry 
inside that’s important. Those mental maps decide your life.  
 
 
If your life in any way, shape or form sucks right now, if it’s unpleasant, 
frustrating, annoying, boring or whatever you want to call it, it’s because 
you’re carrying inside of your world where that portion of the world 
something unhealthy is going on there, and therefore you’re suffering.

If your life is marvelous, fun, fantastic, filled with delights and gifts, that is also 
nothing to do with the world out there. It’s all to do with the world in here. 
You are projecting it.  
 
 
You’re adding that stuff onto the sensory stimulation that your senses are 
getting because your senses have no mind. They will process data like a 
machine almost. It’s what happens in here that matters. It’s the way you 
make sense of things that matters. 
 
 
By the way, who here feels themselves stuck in Bucket Land to one extent or 
another? A couple of people are putting two hands up. I understand. 
Hallelujah, I’m getting out of Bucket Land. It’s not very helpful to tell you it’s 
your fault. You have the wrong maps. You live in the wrong world.  
 
 
It’s not very helpful to you. It may be true but that’s just more blame, unless 
of course your world goes yes I need someone who’s forthright and tells me 
the truth no matter how hard it is.  
 
 
Once again, am I harming you or am I helping you by telling you this? I don’t 
know. I can make predictions about what most people’s inner worlds look 
like, which will let me communicate with a large amount of people, but I’ll 
always get it wrong with some because I’ll never understand the nuances in 
everyone’s internal world. 
 
 
What we’re doing now is we’re working up to it slowly, incrementally, safely. 
How do we build the world inside ourselves that we actually want to live in? If 
you build it in here, you’ll start perceiving it out there. If you start perceiving it 
out there, you might even be able to change enough things to make it more 
permanent.  
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? Do you see how just a few relatively 
simple exercises are only there to give you a skill and to start letting you see 
the mental mechanisms in action, the metacognition, so that you stop 
confusing what you think is going on – there’s that word again; think is going 
on, that’s an extra step – with what would be useful for you to see. 
 
 
Of course there are some boundaries we need to come to grips with, which 
we’ll get into over the course of the next few days, so you don’t fall down the 
path of self-delusion. There are self-fulfilling prophecies and there are self-
delusions. What’s the difference? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
116 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
If you think about it, there’s a very small difference between one and the 
other. This is a question that has vexed me for years. Am I just being self-
delusional?  
 
 
I’m having all these wonderful things happening, but then again in other ways 
I am being self-delusional and there’s a very, very narrow boundary where 
you can go from self-fulfilling prophecy and just go down the path of self-
delusion where nothing happens.  
 
 
The difference between one and the other has to do with intent and 
expectation. A self-fulfilling prophecy happens. It occurs. Life changes around 
you. 
 
 
In a self-delusion nothing happening outside will ever change because you’re 
disconnected from it. So, you don’t change the world anymore. You kind of 
change yourself to stop the world from intruding on your delusion. Do you 
understand the difference? 
 
 
We all do it by the way. I do it as much as the next person, but the trick starts 
becoming how do you spot when something is a self-delusion and how do you 
convert it into a self-fulfilling prophecy, one where the things you want to 
occur start occurring. 
 
 
The answer lies in here. We haven’t come close to exploring that yet, but the 
experience you’re starting to have starts pulling back the curtain so that you 
can see the Wizard of Oz working his little machine, so when it comes to the 
point where you can do something with practically, you can start changing 
your internal landscape and that’s going to start filtering out and your 
external landscape will change, which means your behavior will change. 
 
 
As soon as your behavior changes, the reactions the world gives you will 
change, and then you’ve changed from a possible delusion to a self-fulfilling 
prophecy because things are no longer the same for you.  
 
 
In self-delusion your behavior doesn’t change, which means you don’t get 
different responses from the world, which means things stay the same but 
you think they’re not.

Again it’s a subtle nuance. Are you beginning to understand? Isn’t it 
interesting how a small thing, walking down the street and there’s kind of an 
area I’m hazy about, but I’m just going to let it be hazy for now.  
 
 
It creates the illusion of a reality for you, so you’re not afraid to walk from one 
end of the street to the other even though you have no idea what’s going on 
in between. That’s just part of the way your mind does that. We’re going to 
harness those effects in our favor but not just now.  
 
 
Enough talking from me for a little while. Over to you guys. Do you have any 
questions or comments on the stuff we’ve been discussing? 
 
Student: When I was listening to you, I couldn’t stop thinking about – I’m an engineer, 
so I’m used to deconstructing everything. It seems to me – I’ll give you an 
example.  
 
 
For example, this was years ago. I just started learning skiing and was in 
Austria and we were there – I don’t know, eight or 10 people and all of them 
were experienced skiers and I was the only one. 
 
 
So, the first half day they had patience with me, but then they wanted to go 
their way. They wanted to use their time and I fell behind and those damn skis 
and my body hurts. 
 
 
Well, two days later I was much better, to cut the long story short. Is it more 
prevalent because you said we have a lot of maps, not just one but then 
there’s one behind. I think we have lots of different worlds inside of us – at 
least in my case – they get triggered by emotions, so they are already there. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: And I understood you probably not correctly that we’ve got to construct new 
worlds, which to me is much more difficult. I’m sorry… 
 
Igor: 
Allow me to address the thought I think you’re having and then you can 
correct me if I’ve mistaken it. First of all, I disagree with you. I think you did 
understand me correctly. I agree, we have worlds within worlds within us and 
they tell us how to react and respond how to make sense and meaning of 
things.

Many of the things are great and very useful. The fact that you’re an engineer 
is only possible because you have an engineering world inside where things 
work, and as soon as you put something together that doesn’t work, your 
inner world looks at it and says it’s nothing like any machine we have in here, 
that can’t work. 
 
 
Sometimes it’s to your disadvantage of course because that’s how new 
machines get built on different principles. Then you have to expand that 
world to make it work.  
 
 
I agree with you also. Our task will be to create new worlds – brave new 
worlds if you like but without those connotations – that will allow us to have a 
more satisfying experience of whatever reality we happen to have around us; 
hence be more useful and so on. 
 
 
I also take your point that currently it appears that that may be very difficult. 
That’s only because we haven’t got to that yet. 
 
Student: Okay, what I wanted to say is since there are already a lot of worlds inside of 
us, to me it seems like emotions are like light switches. If you have one 
emotion, you have access to one world. If you have another emotion, you 
have access to a totally different world, totally different possibilities, chances, 
dangers and everything. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. So, now you’re talking about state-dependent learning. You know the 
earlier rooms inside your mind. Your happy room will have one world. Your 
sad room will have another world.  
 
 
If you’re habitually in the sad room, you can do sad very well and have lots 
and lots of wonderful worlds within that. It’s just they’re all really sad – and 
vice versa.  
 
 
Emotion is not the only way to navigate those worlds, and you can take parts 
of one world and put them in another world, but we haven’t got even close to 
doing that stuff yet. 
 
 
There’s no point going there because you’d be saying what’s he talking about 
right now? We need to build up those experiences and that’s what we’re 
doing right now.

You absolutely guessed correctly. This is where we’re going. We won’t be 
doing it the way you expect it. It won’t be as direct as you think it is. It will be 
a lot easier than you can think of right now, but let’s reserve judgment until 
we actually get to that portion. 
 
 
Right now we’re still learning the tools that will help us build worlds. We 
haven’t even got to building worlds yet.  
 
Arthur: 
I’d just like to clarify in my own mind, I found that when I was describing my 
neighborhood, which essentially is my backyard, that I could only do it in very 
brief detail because there’s a lot to see. 
 
 
I remember a few years ago at a meeting we had an exercise where we 
learned to tell a story, and I remember telling a whole story about opening up 
a drawer and putting on a pair of socks in the morning, and that was a 
detailed story for two or three minutes. So, I’m trying to understand the 
difference between those two. 
 
Igor: 
First of all, it comes back to your original question from earlier, which is how 
much detail do you give? You have so much detail in your internal reality that 
it would take you an hour or two to describe even the most significant parts 
of it, and that’s just one room for example. 
 
 
Again, we don’t need that. This is kind of training us for other things. The fact 
that you are aware of them is enough. Just do this for a second. Close your 
eyes for a moment and think of a room that you’re very familiar with, and 
then mentally just notice all the details as quickly as possible and then come 
back. 
 
 
Very good. How long did that take? A couple of seconds, right? His eyes are 
open now, just so you know. Now do the same thing and describe those same 
details.  
 
 
How long would it take you to describe all those details? At least 20 minutes, 
a half an hour or something like that. Maybe even more once you got into the 
flow of it. So, this tells you something very important. Your mind works much 
more quickly than your capacity to describe it.  
 
Arthur: 
Especially if told you about what’s in each of the books on the shelf.

Igor: 
Exactly, because each of those books becomes a reference point to a new 
world, which is another set of information and so on. This is very important, 
folks.  
 
 
Within the context of what we’re doing here, I don’t care about the 
descriptions. The descriptions are totally and utterly irrelevant. They’re 
merely training wheels to help you stabilize it. 
 
 
Let me just pick a room. I’ll go to the house I grew up in. I’m going to pick the 
front garden. I’m done. Why? Because my attempt to describe it to all of you 
has stabilized so much that I can see it vividly. I can see the tree right there. I 
can see the wall covering around there going straight over here, the gate over 
here. 
 
 
I don’t even have to tell you about the rose bushes. They’re all probably dead 
because in the wintertime it’s cold and they’re not there. There are flower 
bushes there. Oh, I can look into the living room.  
 
 
It’s all inside my mind already and I only need to describe it to you enough to 
make it vivid for me. Now there is a point to description at some point to 
create linguistic talent at bringing what’s inside out.  
 
 
There is a point to that, so describing is actually a useful skill anyways. It 
improves your linguistic talent. If you’re interested in writing for example, like 
screenwriting and so on – actually screenwriting will be different. You don’t 
have to be able to say it out loud for screenwriting but you have to be able to 
type it. 
 
 
Typing and speaking are different skills. They’re related but they’re different. 
So, if you want to be a writer, then you write out these descriptions. If you 
want to be a storyteller, then you have to speak out these descriptions 
because neurologically different things are going on at those points. 
 
 
For our purposes here, we don’t care about those things. Those are specialist 
uses that we don’t care about. As soon as your internal reality is stable and 
vivid, you’re done, which means I fully expect some of you as these exercises 
go along to say something like all right I’m in Paraguay. I’m there.

Good and then I’ll go down… good and then open… yes… good. So then 
there’s the… yes… good I go outside and. Do you have any idea what I’m 
talking about? It’s vivid in my mind.  
 
 
If you’re interested I’ll give you the tour now in a slightly longer version. So, 
I’m in Paraguay in my apartment. I’m in the guest bedroom. There are three 
beds against the wall. There are kind of green things there. The blinds are 
currently down.  
 
 
So, I’m going to turn around and there’s a mirror there and a little commode. 
There are some steps going down – that was my going down part, by the way. 
So, in front of me is a little kitchenette area. I’m going to open the fridge.  
 
 
These actions start making sense to you now but they’ve been making sense 
to me way, way before that. This is not a hypnosis training. It’s not a coaching 
training. This is not a communication training.  
 
 
I do not care if the person sitting next to you has any idea what is going on as 
you’re describing these things. You’re describing it for you, not for them. As 
soon as it’s vivid inside your mind, if you want you can move on.  
 
 
If you enjoy it, by all means describe some things, but then you’re doing it just 
for the amusement value or for the linguistic value to connect descriptions of 
your internal experience, which will be very important for those of you who 
want to be able to then describe metacognition to others.  
 
 
That way you can link language to experiences but don’t be surprised if they 
have no idea what you’re talking about or completely misunderstand you 
because they don’t share the experiences. 
 
 
Does this make sense to you? Incidentally if you do this exercise again, I 
recommend you use the other door – the one that goes to the outside world, 
the front door in other words – and walk about your neighborhood rather 
than your garden because there will just be more experiences there, 
specifically because you less time in them. 
 
Student: Would it be safe to say that a self-fulfilling prophecy versus self-delusion is 
that a self-fulfilling prophecy gets validated by the outside world?

Igor: 
Yes and no. See, I know it now. Now the challenge is turning this into an 
actual description, right? Let’s put it this way. A self-delusion can’t handle a 
world disagreeing with it and so it will do everything possible to avoid being 
aware of the disagreement, either because you remove yourself from those 
environments because they’re too challenging, or because a self-defense 
mechanism kicks in and you change external reality to suit what you think it 
should be doing because it will keep your illusion protected. 
 
 
YouTube is a wonderful place to discover this. If you want to see self-delusion 
in action, YouTube is a winner. There is an amount of people on YouTube who 
will tell you what their reality is – bless them – and in the same breath will 
demonstrate how it’s not true for them and they don’t even realize it. 
 
 
Let’s take anyone who is a fundamentalist, not just in a religious sense but at 
anything, someone who thinks this is the only way it can be and everyone else 
is wrong.  
 
 
I saw a wonderful video of a woman who was kind of a fundamentalist like 
this, who is possibly the most hate-filled person I’ve ever witnessed in my 
entire life. I mean she’s got the twisty eye thing going on.  
 
 
She’s got the rhetoric and the condemnation of everyone around her, and she 
can find fault in every single thing and it’s bitter. You can feel the emotions 
coming out of the TV screen and it’s hurtful and the person isn’t even there.  
 
 
This is the bit that gets me. At the end of this whole rant, she comes up with a 
comment to the effect of ‘but thankfully I’m the most relaxed, easy-going 
person there is.’  
 
 
That is a wonderful example of a self-delusion because she has no awareness 
of how un-easy-going she really is and if anyone ever held a mirror up to her 
and said look, what’s going on here, that’s not being easy here – one of two 
responses will occur. 
 
 
One is she’ll get angry with you, which is a defense mechanism to kick out the 
information, or the other one is she just won’t see it – what are you talking 
about? Look how nice I’m being to them. I’m telling them what their faults are 
so they can fix them. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
123 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That is the way self-delusion maintains itself. Now let’s turn this into a self-
fulfilling prophecy. A self-fulfilling prophecy maintains itself despite 
contradictions in reality. 
 
 
So, let’s take the same kind of hateful person who wants to be an easy-going 
person, and at the end of it let’s just change a slight nuance in her mindset. 
Instead of saying I’m the most easy-going person she might say ‘just watch 
me, in time I’ll be so easy-going that none of this will matter.’  
 
 
 
That’s accepting reality and being willing to change it, interact with it 
differently, and that’s when you start getting different responses from the 
world. Just by putting that little frame at the end there – that little admission 
that I’m not there yet – who here felt different about that woman as I just 
described her? Hands up. 
 
 
That’s how the self-fulfilling prophecy works. The first person is so hateful and 
can’t even see it. What will you likely do? Avoid them or fight with them 
depending on your mindset. Are you as likely to fight with the second person? 
Are you more likely to give them a second chance and hang out with them 
just in case it helps them out? 
 
 
That’s a self-fulfilling prophecy in action right there. They’re willing to engage 
with the reality that is other than the one that they know will ultimately 
happen.  
 
 
So, in a mixture – a symbiosis – there’s a feedback loop between themselves 
and the outside world. If they change their behavior, the outside world 
responds with a different reaction, which changes their behavior further, their 
reaction goes further and bit by bit, increment by increment depending on 
how far they have to go, they will start changing the course of their ship to a 
new position and then they’ll travel there. 
 
 
Let’s imagine we have a flat world theory, you know the one where you fall 
off the edge of the world if your ship travels too far. The self-delusional 
person will say no, the world is round by definition. I shall keep on sailing and 
when they get to the edge of the world they fall off.  
 
 
When the sailors say look there’s nothing there, we’re going to fall off, they’ll 
say don’t be silly, when we get to it you’ll see I’m right, and they go right off 
the edge.

The self-fulfilling prophecy on the other hand says all right we’re now going to 
circumnavigate the globe. We’re getting closer to the edge, so let’s stay right 
a bit more and right a bit more. Oh look, I found a whole new country. I told 
you we’d do it.  
 
 
Do you understand the subtle distinction there? We’ve spent a lot of time on 
this now and technically it’s not really part of what we’re doing here, but 
hopefully the experiences you’ve had so far today kind of feed into what 
you’re doing here. You’re beginning to start seeing your mental mechanisms 
in action. 
 
 
The next step will be to start creating safe environments to explore whatever 
delusions are keeping you the way you are right now. I have them, you have 
them, we all have them but the problem is we’re fish in water. We can’t see 
what’s going on and that’s precisely because we can’t change it. It’s a 
feedback loop. 
 
 
I don’t know it’s happening, so I can’t see it, so I can’t do anything about it. So, 
it happens again. I can feel the experience of it. I can only infer it and that’s a 
very difficult thing to do.  
 
 
Luckily, I have an unconscious mind that knows a little bit more about this 
stuff than I do, that sees things plainly without as many things added on top 
of it that I’ve added on top of that, and that’s the loophole that will give me 
freedom.  
 
 
Have you heard the phrase a psychotic insight? I’ll just explain that very 
briefly. Psychosis of course for many people is a very terrible thing. 
Incidentally if you look at Shamanic practices, the best Shamans tend to be 
psychotic.  
 
 
They’ve merely mastered their psychosis sufficiently to become great healers, 
which is an interesting point, which I think our model of medicine might learn 
from somewhat, but that’s neither here nor there for now. 
 
 
When someone is having a psychotic break, one of the things that tends to 
happen is their meaning-making mechanisms alter, they change. They’ll see 
reality almost without the filters that put meaning onto things, which is why 
things can seem really bizarre.

So, on occasion they’ll see something that no one else can notice because 
we’ve all filtered it out. We’ve all deluded ourselves it’s not going on and 
they’ll go right to the point and say this is going on, and people will say how 
the hell does he know that? 
 
 
It’s because we’re all so polite, we’ve deluded ourselves that we can’t see it, 
we’re not supposed to see it. Does that make senses? In some respects, you’ll 
be able to develop a kind of psychotic insight into yourself, into places where 
you are stuck and suddenly you’ll see it and say huh, wow, I never thought 
that was possible but clearly that’s why it was. 
 
 
Is this helpful to you? We’ve kind of fallen down the philosophy track a little 
bit. I’d like to be able to prove more of that to you in terms of your 
experiences, but that really is not going to happen until day four or five. 
We’re setting up reference experiences so that you’ll be able to do that kind 
of work. We’re not even close to that yet. 
 
 
Thank you for that. That was kind of an interesting discussion so far. Are there 
any other comments or questions on what we covered there?  
 
Mindful Mentalization 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s briefly do one last exercise and then we’ll have a break again.  
 
 
What I want you to do is I would like for you to repeat your neighborhood 
exercise a little bit briefer this time. Spend more time outside the house than 
inside of it – and not in your garden. Actually go around your neighborhood. 
Walk to the local park or the local post office.  
 
 
There must be some local features you know how to get to from your house 
and if you don’t walk, drive there. That’s fine. Different countries have 
different customs, right? 
 
 
But I’d like you to do something first to see if it alters the nature of your 
experience. What I’d like for you to do is start off with your mindful breathing 
– in other words count whatever your count was, whether it was four or five it 
doesn’t matter. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
126 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Do your four-count, your five-count or your 10-count. When you’ve reached 
that number, relax a little bit. We’ll call this integration breathing, you know 
when you just kind of let go and don’t even try to do anything particular. You 
just kind of settled your breathing. 
 
 
So, you have your integration breathing for a little bit, and then do the same 
exercise again. So, you’ve just done one little practice before beginning the 
same description essentially you just did a moment ago, and let’s what effect 
that has on your neighborhood tour. 
 
 
Do you all understand the nature of this exercise? We’re essentially putting 
together the last exercise we did in the previous session with the last exercise 
you just did. We’re putting those together in sequence and seeing if that 
alters our experience of it.  
 
 
Then we’ll discuss that and have a break. Does that sound good to you? Spend 
a little less time doing the descriptions, so you’ll have a little bit more time for 
the mindfulness. Off you go.  
Student Demo 
 
Student: We were at the convenience store, or outside the convenience store. I guess I 
could take you to the park. It’s just across the street. There’s a lot of big 
intersections but there’s an intersection outside the convenience store where 
the crowd is and all that. 
 
 
So, walking across the street – the convenience store is at a corner and on the 
other corner across the street is a sports pub, and I guess we should cross 
another street to get to a third corner at that intersection, and there’s a 
café/pub kind of place there and a grocery store. 
 
 
Passing the grocery store on the right-hand side, there are a lot of fresh 
vegetables and fruits outside even though it might be a bit cold. It’s a small 
grocery store run by an immigrant who’s usually – well, one of the family 
members is usually outside and maybe they might greet you. 
 
 
We continue to the park and on the left-hand side there’s a road. We’re on 
the sidewalk. On the right-hand side is a recycling station for glass, metal and 
what have you and also a thing you put disposable grills because a lot of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
127 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
people use those disposable – have their barbeque in the park, so they set up 
one of those as well. There’s a track to the… 
 
Student: But if we’re going to head to the park… we’d want to turn to the right and we 
head towards the university ... It has a great big football stadium, the Terrapin 
football team, it’s a small college. The other big football teams in Texas all pay 
them money to beat them up, to boost their record. 
 
 
So, it still has value and it’s funny it’s a huge stadium. It seats 80,000 people 
but they’ll draw a crowd of maybe 10,000 people. Things have changed since 
1922. The campus itself is lovely. It’s nice architecture. They commissioned an 
artist named James Turrell who does these experiential… 
 
Igor: 
So, who found that interesting? Hands up. Please have a little discussion with 
me about the differences between doing essentially the same exercise twice. 
We just front-loaded it with something.  
 
 
Did you notice some changes the second time around? What kind of changes 
did you notice? We’ll talk about what they were, so we can talk about why 
they were there.  
 
Student: We agreed – my partner and I – that not only was my experience richer but 
his experience of my experience – not only were my internal experiences 
richer but he saw tempo and tonality differences in his engagement as well. 
 
Igor: 
So, what do you think is going on there? Would that be generally true of you 
guys? Your experience got much richer and much more vivid, and if you 
happened to work with a partner, weirdly they kind of transferred as well and 
you kind of saw whatever they were seeing a little more clearly inside your 
mind too. 
 
 
This is an important point called the signal-to-noise ratio. Whenever you do 
any kind of task in life – and everything in life is a task, whether it’s being a 
particular way as an emotional state whether it’s focusing or it’s reading or 
whatever – it’s all task, right? 
 
 
There are elements around that task which are irrelevant to it. They’re 
distractions. If your attention goes towards them, needless things suck up 
your attention and you only have a certain finite amount of attention, and 
there are elements that give you a bigger payoff.

So, it’s like listening to a radio station – if it’s half tuned, you’ve got a lot of 
noise and a little bit of signal. You can kind of make out what it is but it’s 
difficult.  
 
 
Now if you learn to tune out the noise, either because your ear ignores it – 
has anyone here ever lived next to some loud place like a railway station or 
something like that? What happens over time is your mind adapts and it cuts 
out the noise.  
 
 
It realizes all this noise is unimportant to me, and you can have a perfectly 
comfortable conversation with someone who’s thinking what are you saying? 
Doesn’t this drive you mad? Doesn’t what drive me mad? Oh, the train. Oh 
yeah, go figure. 
 
 
Your brain is very good at this. It’s very important you understand that when 
tasks are difficult, it’s either because you’re trying to achieve the wrong task 
like we talked about earlier, or you’re putting too much attention on noise 
because you can’t distinguish between what’s noise and what’s signal. 
 
 
In terms of mastering anything, believe it or not masters at any task – 
whether it’s playing a game or sports or writing – their mastery comes from 
being able to do less, not more.  
 
 
They limit their choices so that when they’re confronted with this massive 
noise with a couple of signals in between, their mind ignores all the noise and 
knows what signals to pay attention to, to get a success. Does that kind of 
make sense to you? 
 
 
Now coming back to your point, it was more vivid, it was richer. Why? Your 
mindful count collected your attention. What’s happening now? Your 
attention is not distributed amongst random unimportant trivial things, and 
so there’s less noise and more signal.  
 
 
There’s more attention left to do the task and therefore it becomes richer and 
so on. You’ve built a dam up. The period of integration breathing where you 
didn’t do anything particular just kind of lets you go from one task to another 
– and we’ll use integration breathing for a different person later on in the 
course but for now we don’t need that.

So, you had all this pure unadulterated attention not being siphoned off on 
unimportant noise, so when you focus it on a signal – the task of walking 
around your neighborhood, mentalizing it – it became richer and more vivid 
for you. 
 
 
That’s a long-winded description of what I’m talking about. Think about your 
own lives. How many times when you’re really good at something are you 
totally able to tune out everything that’s irrelevant to it whilst you’re good at 
it? 
 
 
The things that you’re bad at – do you see where I’m going with this? You’ve 
now had a personal experience of the signal-to-noise ratio that helps with 
mastery. 
 
 
Let me tell you how good your brain is at this. You have to train it properly 
and very, very precisely. There’s a book I read – I can’t remember what it’s 
called now. I’ve got to find it again. It’s a great one. It’s about neuroscience 
and the things that we’ve been discovering and about neuroplasticity in 
particular. 
 
 
One of the examples is a lady who had to go through an operation. She had 
anesthetic, which for a very small percentage of people the anesthetic 
destroys their vestibular system. The vestibular system is a part inside your 
inner ear that allows you to be balanced. 
 
 
There are very few people who have this condition but it’s a very, very 
troublesome one. As a result of this, she cannot stand up straight. As soon as 
she tries to stand up, her vestibular system has so much noise coming in – 
98% of her vestibular system was destroyed.  
 
 
There was so much noise coming in that she doesn’t know if she’s standing 
straight or lying horizontal, so she’s constantly feels like she’s falling over, 
which may sound kind of interesting for now but if you ever have the 
experience it is frightening. She can be lying on the ground and still feel like 
she’s falling over, which is terrible for people who have that.  
 
 
In the late 1990’s, neuroscientists were convinced that it doesn’t matter what 
happens to a child as long as they don’t hurt his brain – you don’t actually 
damage it – he will turn out exactly the same way whether you mistreat him 
or not.

They were convinced about this. They didn’t say it quite as bluntly as this 
because of social whiplASH, but they were convinced that it doesn’t matter 
what happens, they will grow up exactly the same way because it’s all in the 
brain. The brain controls it all and the brain has fixed architecture. 
 
 
They used to believe that once your brain is formed, you start losing brain 
cells and they never replenish. It’s true and it’s not true at the same time. You 
can build vast neural connections. 
 
 
Fast forward a bit, a couple of scientists didn’t believe this. They had evidence 
to the contrary but they couldn’t publish it because as soon as they used the 
word neuroplasticity, it was a dirty word in so-called science at the time and 
people refused to publish it, or if they did publish it people wouldn’t take it 
seriously. 
 
 
So, they had to use code words and say look we did this experience and got 
some really odd results, I’m not quite sure how to explain it. They did this for 
20 years before someone had the courage to actually call it what it was. 
 
 
So, let’s get back to our lady here. Ninety-eight percent of her vestibular 
system is destroyed. She cannot stand up. She has too much noise going on. 
Have you ever woken up especially maybe after a night of heavy partying and 
you kind of try to open your eyelids and they’re all kind of caked over and you 
can’t really see straight. It’s like I can’t see anything and everything is a blur to 
you. 
 
 
Has anyone ever had that kind of experience? Maybe it’s just me. A bad 
analogy – I don’t know. So, imagine trying to navigate through the world 
when you’re so used to using vision and now that’s been taken away from 
you. It’s a very difficult thing to deal with, and even more so for the vestibular 
system because you cannot stand up. 
 
 
Anyway, she worked with a researcher who didn’t buy into the myth that had 
been propounded for the last 100 years or so before that. I think his name is 
Dareet or something like that. 
 
 
So, he creates a machine. It’s an electrode that she puts on her tongue. He 
puts a little thing on her head that has a gyroscope, so it can tell which way 
she’s standing.

When she starts tilting to the left, there’s a little electrical pulse that goes on 
the left side of the tongue. When she tilts towards the right, there’s a little 
electrical pulse that goes to the right side of the tongue – back and front the 
same way. 
 
 
It’s a very basic machine, very relatively simple to construct. He puts the plate 
on her tongue which can sense. He puts the artificial vestibular system on her 
head.  
 
 
Within minutes she’s standing up straight. The panic disappears. She breathes 
a sigh of relief because for the first time in actually years all this noise that’s 
driving her mad has disappeared. She doesn’t constantly feel like she’s falling 
over, which would of course be a terrible thing. 
 
 
Here’s the interesting part. She stands up for 10 minutes. They take the 
device off her. She can stand for another 30 seconds without the device, a 
little afterglow. Wonderful, isn’t it? But then it goes away and she’s 
devastated again. 
 
 
 
So, she goes home and comes back a day later or a week later – I’m not quite 
sure what the time interval was. She does this thing again. She builds up to 20 
minutes. The afterglow starts lasting longer, first 30 seconds and then a 
minute and then a little bit longer. 
 
 
The longer she can hold her balance using this thing, the longer her training 
continues, the longer the afterglow continues. First it’s minutes. Then it’s 
hours. Then it’s day.  
 
 
Eventually she puts the whole machine on and she takes it off. Years later she 
can still balance perfectly. What just happened? 
 
Student: The new experiences…. 
 
Igor: 
The signal-to-noise ratio has changed. Let’s take a room with 100 signals in it, 
of which 90 of them tell you which way to go and 10 of them are useless and 
you ignore them. It’s a very high signal-to-noise ratio.

One day someone comes in and, without telling you, gets rid of all those 
signals, so only two of those units of those little lights still give you useful 
information and the rest don’t only you don’t know which two it is.  
 
 
They all look the same to you. You don’t know which ones you pay attention 
to, so you’re going to get it wrong constantly, aren’t you? If you have 100 
tries, even if you were to systematically try every one of them, which of 
course would requires a significant amount of consciousness, which she 
hasn’t got in her vestibular system – you’d only get it right two out of 100 
times. 
 
 
But here comes this machine, this wonderful machine that is an artificial 
vestibular system and now her brain has a feedback loop. Look, when I’m 
balancing with this machine, only these few signals are giving this message. 
Everything is useless.  
 
 
She’s basically taught her brain to ignore all the other noises and only pay 
attention to the signal. Even though she only has a 2% working vestibular 
system, that 2% is enough for her to live a healthy, active life without 
constantly having the feeling of falling over. 
 
 
That’s a pretty significant thing for your mind to be able to do, wouldn’t you 
say? That’s what you experienced when you did the exercise and had some 
kind of mind-clearing beforehand but I didn’t ask you to clear your mind, did 
I? No, because how do you clear your mind?  
 
 
Some of you have to shake your head – get out! Some of you try to relax. 
These are all basically different methods for doing it. The mindfulness count is 
like a dam collecting attention.  
 
 
The integration breathing basically allows that attentional energy to start 
flowing smoothly and then when you give it a channel and you open up a 
floodgate somewhere, all that energy is going only towards where you want it 
to go, and that’s why it became more vivid and richer for you. Isn’t that 
interesting? 
 
 
You have just learned how to change your brain physically. The physical 
architecture of your brain is changing, in the same way as someone who loses 
their sight their occipital lobes still keep working. It’s just other information 
starts taking over from it.

They start processing tactile information for example, auditory information. 
So, a blind person can hear better and touch better than a sighted person, not 
because we’re not all capable of it. It’s just this wonderful computer is not 
doing anything, might as well use it for something useful. 
 
 
People who have had accidents and had this part of the language area 
destroyed, can learn to speak again because other parts of their brain take 
over the functions of the damaged part, but it requires training. 
 
 
During the break, I talked to someone here about the research of Dr. Jeffrey 
Schwartz, who’s another wonderful person who does the same thing. He 
takes people with OCD, the people who have to obsessively wASH their hands 
or close doors three times and stuff like that. 
 
 
By taking an FMRI scan and taking a photograph of the brain in action, you 
actually see a certain strange part of your neurology looping around, which 
the rest of us don’t have. That’s why they’re stuck.  
 
 
It’s not that they’re irrational or have no self-control or anything like that. No, 
their architecture, their landscape physically in their brain is different and it 
creates a very unpleasant condition. 
 
 
He goes through a form of metacognition with them where bit by bit they see 
their brain scans changing. They literally see the topography of OCD changing 
with every iteration of the exercise, which of course gives them more faith 
and confidence to continue the exercise. 
 
 
Eventually they get to the point where that neurological network is eradicated 
sufficiently for them to have total control, no OCD behavior, no compulsion 
left. Isn’t that interesting?  
 
 
So, right now you should be very excited about the capacity your mind has, 
and this last exercise was really designed in part as actually a training to build 
your mind up, but for now it’s more important to me that you understand 
another subtle nuance, which is your capacity to change in an instant.  
 
 
You had to do something for it, and just like the lady who had the vestibular 
problem the afterglow – which is what the integration breathing part was

about, that’s the afterglow and then going into the exercise – will be very 
short at first.  
 
 
You’ve got to do a lot of mindfulness before your attention is strong enough 
to have this rich experience again but the more you do the practices, the 
longer the afterglow lasts until you have the kind of control over your mind 
that you wish to have.  
 
 
Is this making sense to you? I kind of ranted on a little bit there. Let’s have a 
little break. I apologize to some of you. I know you have comments. We’ll go 
back to your comments and questions after the break. Let’s take 15 minutes.

DVD 4 – “Mental Gymnastics & Important 
Steps When Working With Your Unconscious 
Mind 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How are you doing? Who’s starting to feel a little cooked? 
We’re trying to combine a lot of conceptual frameworks with some of the 
experiences that you’ve had so that we can start teasing what your 
experiences mean and what they can teach us to fast track certain things. 
 
 
Whilst those concepts are interesting and they’re important, the really 
important part is the practical aspects. If it’s okay with you, we’re going to go 
back to this question and answer session and talk a little bit about your 
experiences you just had to pull out a few more concepts. 
 
 
Once we’ve done that we’ll spend a whole bunch of time learning variations 
of essentially the same exercise just so you don’t go into the boredom trap, so 
you have other ways of exercising your brain in similar ways so that you can 
build the muscle. 
 
 
To use the training equivalent, if all you’re doing is push-ups eventually you 
get bored with them and they stop having the impact, but if you can have 
different exercises that work the same muscle groups as a push-up does, then 
at least it will be more interesting and the chance of you doing more of them 
will continue. Does that make sense? 
 
 
We’re going to figure out ways of making these exercises more interesting but 
we need to set the foundation before we can do that, and that’s something 
we’ve been doing here. 
 
 
There were a number of you who still wanted to share a couple of 
experiences, or maybe make comments or ask questions. This would be a 
good time because after this we’ll basically just be doing a lot of actual drilling 
and a lot of work in the vein that we’ve been going down so far.

Student: I just wanted to share that when my partner was telling his story, he was 
much, much involved and he was more animated and he was more real, more 
alive. It was actually a very, very interesting experience. 
 
Igor: 
It’s because he was experiencing more of the signals and less of the noise, so 
he’s paying attention only to the mentalization part of the experience and to 
all the other stuff that usually fogs it out or gets it out of consciousness and so 
on. 
 
Student: It was like he was living it rather than telling it. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, and look how quickly that happened. I mean in terms of actual exercise 
practical time, how much have you done? Less than an hour, right? We’ve 
done mostly talking about your experience so that we can conceptualize what 
we’re trying to achieve, but actual practice – it’s been very little. 
 
 
When I’ve been teaching this to people – I usually teach this one-to-one – we 
progress much more quickly because I can just nuance each exercise very 
quickly and just go onto the next and the next one and the next. So, most of it 
is just exercises and then a little bit of it is explanation in between so they get 
to the point much more quickly.  
 
 
As a bigger group, we have to move more slowly because I need to make sure 
that we’re all on the same page, that we’re all trying to achieve the same 
things.  
 
 
Otherwise a couple days down the line, I’ll ask for something and you’ll say 
how the hell do you do that, because you’ll have missed something important 
here, which kind of goes there. Does that make sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: A couple of things happened. I get the twitches, like my whole body just 
shakes when I’m in a kind of meditative state sometimes, and my partner said 
that the same thing happens to him. What do you think that is? What’s 
happening? 
 
Igor: 
First of all, I don’t think anyone knows. There are all kinds of explanations. 
Some people say that it’s residual tension releasing. Other people say it’s the 
equivalent of having a dream but it’s a physical thing and your body just starts 
having spontaneous motion.

Honestly, I don’t think anyone knows what it is. The point is it’s benign. It 
doesn’t affect anything that you’re doing. The same thing can happen to me. I 
don’t always do it, but especially earlier on it would tend to happen to me. I 
go through phases when it happens and when it doesn’t happen. It can just be 
a good sign for you that the kind of attention that we need to do the work is 
there.  
 
 
Notice how you didn’t seek it. It just kind of happened as a result of other 
things that you were doing, which goes back to our earlier discussion, which is 
instead of relaxing in order to meditate, instead of focusing in order to 
meditate, instead of getting at alpha level in order to meditate and then 
having difficulties figuring out whether or not you’re doing it right, why not do 
a task which is so clear to you that in engaging that task it automatically 
switches your state of consciousness to the one that makes the task easy and 
hence you’re there? 
 
 
That’s what we just did essentially in the last exercise. Your breath count 
mindfulness was a task that’s very simple and very clear for you, which in turn 
allowed you to have the integration breathing – that very gentle relaxed 
attention on your breathing without any effort at all – which then in turn sets 
the right conditions for doing the actual mentalization process much more 
vividly and much more richly than you’re used to. 
 
 
Now I’m going to make all of you a promise. Tomorrow morning when you get 
up and you do a mentalization, it will be totally different. It will be a lot harder 
than it is now, guaranteed.  
 
 
But that’s okay because if you think back to the lady with the vestibular 
problem, right now you’re enjoying the afterglow of having done a certain 
kind of work, having taught your mind to be very precise about something. 
 
 
By tomorrow your mind will forget because it’s not a habit yet. So, you’ll have 
to recreate the same conditions and each time that you do it, it will get easier 
and quicker to get there and eventually you’ll wonder why people have a 
problem because you just close your eyes and whatever scene you need to be 
there will be there for you, which is kind of where you are semi-already 
because you already said you got very clear visualizations but maybe they 
aren’t.

You need to learn that this is a learning process and you’ll fall off the pony a 
few times. You’ll get back up again and eventually it will become totally easy 
for you and, importantly, it will be there for you under duress, which is when 
it needs to be there the most. Does that make sense? 
 
Student: Yes and the added part was that I felt more alive in my body. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: I felt the cells tingling. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Really, this is a cultural issue. Our culture ironically negates the physical. 
For such an externally oriented culture, we tend to neglect our bodies, our 
physical experience.  
 
 
Think about school. What do schools train you to do? I used that word very 
specifically – to ignore your body, but I have to fidget. Stop it, it won’t help 
your concentration. Actually, they’re wrong. I don’t know if you ever had a 
teacher like this. They ask you a question and you say well, um – and then 
what do they say? What are you looking up there for? It’s not written on the 
ceiling.  
 
 
That is the most unhelpful comment you can imagine because what they’re 
not realizing is as their eyeballs are moving up there, they’re actually 
accessing information in a different way than if they’re looking directly 
forwards.  
 
 
It’s an assistant to their thinking process, and when they’re ridiculed for doing 
something that makes thinking easier for them, they are inhibiting the 
entrance to the thought process and then they can’t think anymore. But 
because the teacher doesn’t do it that way, it can’t be done that way. Do you 
see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Our bodies are very similar in the sense that we’ve had almost a lifetime of 
experience of building our intellect if you’ve gone through this whole school 
process. Then we have to learn to ignore our bodies so that we can sit longer 
at the desk.  
 
 
I mean think about it. How many people have a 9:00 to 5:00 type of work? 
You turn up at the office in the morning and then you leave at 5:00, 6:00, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
139 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
10:00 or 12:00 at night depending on whether you’re a lawyer or not. That is 
the most unnatural thing you can possibly do. 
 
 
Go to any slightly older culture and you will never find an individual sitting in 
the same position for 10 hours straight, unless of course they’re the faqirs or 
the gurus who are doing something very different than you’d be doing in an 
office.  
 
 
It’s very unnatural and the only way we get away with it is by ignoring our 
physical bodies, which means our experience of life increasingly becomes 
more impoverished. We’ve learned to ignore the very machine that makes it 
so rich and vivid and buzzing and tingling and so on. 
 
 
We’re learning to reverse that a little bit now. The more mindful you become, 
the more it will reverse. When you start adding the ASH symbolism, the 
archetypal forces and the symbolic landscapes into that and you do a little 
hero’s journey through it – as we’ll get onto in due course – that just 
multiplies incredibly. 
 
 
One of the beta testers for this for example, on his wish list he just had a baby 
so he wanted to become more emotionally responsive, which I think is very 
responsible to want to be as a parent.  
 
 
He’s a very successful businessperson, so he’s friendly, fun and a good person 
but he’s not too in touch with his feelings and he’ll quite suggest that. Long 
story short, we went through a particular goal-setting process – which we’ll 
come onto with you – to help him build his business.  
 
 
He spent two or three months sitting on the couch doing nothing. His business 
was slowly falling apart to the point of getting desperate. Then we did a 
particular process and just as he was getting desperate and saying in his mind 
look we’re about to fail and I’m going to lose my family and my kid’s going to 
suffer and so on, do you know what his unconscious said to him? Good – 
which shocked him and got his attention. 
 
 
Then we did something else – and we’ll talk about what that was when we get 
to the appropriate segment for it – and his life has transformed now. He is on 
fire. Everything he was incapable of before is just like that’s child’s play, that’s 
kindergarten stuff compared to what to he’s doing now.

Now of course it’s new. It’s only just starting to form and evolve right now, so 
I can’t make any claims about the longevity of it yet, but I have no doubts 
about it and to be honest neither does he.  
 
 
Does that make sense to you? We’re not anywhere near doing that yet. We’re 
still building tools. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: Just a practical question. On the average for the ordinary untrained mind, 
how long do we have to do this mindfulness stuff so that it’s more than just 
an afterglow? 
 
Igor: 
So then the question is this: How long would an average person have to work 
out in the gym in order to become an Olympic sprinter? It’s impossible to 
answer because some people will come better equipped than others 
 
 
Some have a genetic predisposition to athleticism and others do not. Some 
people have already trained more, so they need less work than others do. 
Honestly, I can’t even begin to give you an answer to that.  
 
 
Maybe once I’ve been teaching this program for 10 years, then 10 years of 
actual students giving me their feedback will give me a better answer for you, 
but I’m not there yet. I haven’t got that kind of experience to give you an 
honest answer to it. So, my honest answer is I do not know right now. 
 
 
As far as you’re concerned, you just keep doing it and you’ll notice. It will get 
longer and longer and longer, and one day you’ll forget about it and you’ll 
realize oh, it’s kind of just there. 
 
 
My suspicion is, just like physical exercise, you will need to continuously 
reinforce it, just like if you become sedentary you could be the world’s 
greatest athlete, but great athletes also become great Santa Claus figures 
over time.  
 
 
Thank you for that. I will also say, especially if you combine it with the ASH 
Practices that we’ll come onto, it will be significantly less than if you only did 
mindfulness training.  
 
 
Remember, we’re not doing mindfulness training primarily for this afterglow 
that we just discovered. We’re doing mindfulness training primarily because 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
141 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
it’s your parachute. It’s your safety valve for when you start facing the really 
big stuff in your life, and we haven’t even come onto that yet. 
 
 
The fact that you have this afterglow and life gets more exciting and so on – 
that’s just a wonderful side effect. Are there any other comments or 
questions on that? 
 
 
All right, I think what it’s time to do now is it’s time to just start rehearsing 
something, get some practice in to get more of this out there. We’ve got a 
combination. You’ve seen there is a progression from room to house to 
neighborhood. Is that correct?  
 
 
The neighborhood one is technically the most demanding of them all because 
there are scenes or scenery that you’re not aware of, so it gets kind of grayed 
out, but who’s noticing that even that scenery that unconsciously you 
couldn’t quite make out earlier is starting to get more vivid now? Is anyone 
starting to notice that? 
 
 
It’s because it’s there. You walk past that street, you walk past that house all 
the time, it’s registered unconsciously but it’s so much further removed from 
consciousness that accessing it is more difficult. That’s one of the ways the 
memory works. 
 
 
You’ve just noticed that by doing something else with your mind, the 
unconscious information becomes more accessible. What I want to do now is 
just rehearse that aspect of it.  
 
 
What I’d like you to do is either with your partner, or if you want to have 
more practice do this on your own – in other words pretend there’s a partner 
and actually have a talk out loud or mentally do it that way, because if you’re 
doing it on your own you get two go’s. If you’re doing it with a partner, you 
have to switch roles, but it’s up to you.  
 
 
If you like doing it with a partner, if it’s motivating for you to do it with a 
partner, if you’re enthusiastic about doing it with a partner, do it with a 
partner. You have the opportunity right now.  
 
 
When you get home, maybe someone in your life will help you do that as well, 
but eventually you’ll have to wean yourself off your partner so that you can 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
142 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
do it just for yourself because that’s when your personal practice starts 
happening. 
 
 
But that doesn’t have to be today. It doesn’t have to be in this particular 
week. It’s just a point that you will want to aim to reach eventually so that 
you’re no longer dependent on external circumstances to do this work.  
 
Double Tour 
 
Igor: 
We’re now going to reverse, to split the cycle up slightly. What I want you to 
do is sit down with your partner and tour the neighborhood in just a few 
minutes. At the end of that whole cycle, just do five comfortable breaths – the 
breath count. So even if you can do 10, just do a couple fewer.  
 
 
If you can’t do five, of course just do two or three or whatever you can do, but 
if you can do five comfortably just stick to that just so that it builds a little bit 
of pressure on your dam. 
 
 
Then just settle into some integration breathing for 30 seconds, a minute or 
whatever feels natural to you, and then pause the exercise. Then you can 
have a discussion with your partner if you want. Let them have a go and then 
you’ll do it a second time after they’ve had a go. 
 
 
If you’re doing it on your own, you’ll just pause, stretch, get a drink or 
whatever it is, and once you’ve had a break from the exercise, you’ll go back 
and do the same exercise again, only this time choose a different 
neighborhood. Give someone a tour of somewhere else. 
 
 
Now call me foolish, if you will – just not in front of my face – but I suspect 
that more than one of you in this room has the ability to navigate more than 
one neighborhood. You know how to walk around your office. You know how 
to walk around your home.  
 
 
You probably know how to walk around your old home. You probably know 
how to walk around the home you grew up in, and I suspect – especially the 
older ones in this room – that it’s not the same place that you’re living in now.  
 
 
You’re not still living in mommy and daddy’s house and the same bedroom 
with the same posters you had when you were 12 years old, but you still have 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
143 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
access to those environments in terms of your mental map. Would that be fair 
to say? 
 
 
Each time you repeat the exercise, see if you can come up with a different 
neighborhood, a different tour to take. If you want to you can use the same 
neighborhood that you’re in, just go a different route, go somewhere else.  
 
 
The post office is on the left but the bus stop is down to the right, so let’s go 
to the bus stop. Does that make sense to you? We’re going to change the 
environment each time but the task is identical, and of course the simplicity is 
identical because it’s something that’s still very familiar to you. 
 
 
Do you all understand the nature of the exercise? You’ll all be doing it twice at 
least with a partner. If you’re doing it on your own, you get to do it four times 
because you get to be your partner. All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, now we do the countdown or the count in between them.  
 
Student: Tell me about neighborhood one. 
 
Student: All right. Well, as I told you, when you get out on the sidewalk from the 
apartment we were in, if you turn to the right and continue down the 
sidewalk, you cross the street and you go through that tunnel, and on the 
other side we cross the street. We can do that again. 
 
 
We cross the tram tracks and get to the bus stop and the bicycles as I move 
along to the convenience store and at the intersection we cross the street to 
the sports pub at the other corner.  
 
 
We cross another street and we end up at the corner by the café/pub, and 
then it’s the grocery store on the right-hand side and past the recycling 
station, and we’re at the park with the road to the right and the possibility of 
going through the row of trees. We follow that line of trees down and we’ll be 
at the bus stop, and now I think I will do my count. 
 
Student: Tell me about a different neighborhood.

Student: I’ll tell you about the same neighborhood but a different route. So, we’re 
outside the apartment. Instead of walking through the tunnel, we take a right, 
still on a sidewalk.  
 
 
That road is smaller, a lot of parked cars along it. On the left-hand side there’s 
a – what do you call it – the electric car charge station for two or three cars, I 
guess, provided free by the city, and as the block continues, on the right-hand 
side there’s – that’s apparently it according to Igor. 
 
Student: Your breath. 
 
Student: My breath? 
 
Student: Five counts. Integrating but forgetting the close. 
 
Student: Oh, afterwards as well? So, I could tell you about the way from my job I had 
earlier in the northernmost civilization in the world and all that. So, I would 
leave my job and the job was – the department I was managing was in the 
same building as the grocery store. So, I would leave the grocery store and 
take a right and there would be a statue in the middle of a small square or 
plaza, a sculpture or a statue of a coal miner. That’s why people are there in 
the first place, mining for coal.  
 
 
And walking across that square on my way back home, there would be – the 
post office and bank would be on the right-hand side and on the glass doors 
to the entrance to the bank and the post office, there would be a sign telling 
you that you’re not allowed to bring your guns inside the bank or inside the 
post office. You should use the gun rack outside or inside the bank or the post 
office. 
 
 
And if you continue down, on the left-hand side there’s a hospital, a small tiny 
little hospital situated. On the right-hand side on that road there would be a 
Kindergarten, and the Kindergarten is grey, which is kind of weird since 
another block not far from there has a lot of different colored houses and it’s 
weird. It’s a weird detail that the Kindergarten is grey. 
 
 
When you continue down on the left-hand side there’s a hotel with a bit of a 
different architecture. It’s got a pointy – a lot of points and edges all around. 
And now you’re actually on the top of a hill and when you go – you go to the 
right after the hotel and you’ll see some kind of fence.

I knew why it was there before but I don’t seem to be able to remember, 
because a lot of the tourists who come think that fence is for the polar bears, 
and a defense for polar bears – a fence wouldn’t do much at all. I guess it 
could be to block snowmobile traffic. That makes sense. 
 
 
But standing on that hill it suddenly appears so clear that I’m in an arctic 
desert because there aren’t any trees at all on that group of islands, and there 
are only bare mountaintops and flattened snow and it is a desert. That’s 
dawned upon me again. I think I want to sit with that moment for a while. 
 
Session Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How was that? Was that interesting? Who’s noticing your 
practice is starting to improve exponentially – in other words it’s getting 
easier and easier, and becoming more and more vivid and more and more 
rich?  
 
 
Who’s also noticing that you’re getting more involved in your internal 
imagery? In other words, it’s becoming more demanding than your external 
reality is. Who lost track? Who kind of forgot that you were in a seminar 
room?  
 
 
There are a few hands starting to go up. That’s an excellent sign, by the way. 
As long as you don’t do it whilst you’re crossing the street or something, 
you’re good to go.  
 
 
Over to you guys. What kinds of experiences did you have? What surprised 
you about doing it that way – in other words repeating the same structure of 
an exercise with different content a few times – and things started emerging? 
What kinds of experiences did you have? 
 
Student:  I found it quite disorienting at the end because I live in Germany and I flew in 
from Munich last night, and I’m at a seminar with people I’ve never met 
before. I described my neighborhood in Munich the first time and then my 
neighborhood in Belfast where I grew up, and when I opened my eyes it was 
like where the hell am I? 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.

Student: I had no idea where I was. 
 
Igor: 
Isn’t this interesting? You’re describing the effect similar to people who have 
been in deep hypnotic trances, where you’re literally losing connection to 
your external reality. Look how quickly you did it, and wasn’t it easy to do? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Your mind is capable of a lot of things, a lot of very fast changes. Rest assured 
when you do this exercise again tomorrow morning, it will be nowhere near 
the same, nowhere near as easy because your afterglow is not there 
anymore. 
 
 
 
 
Then we’ll start all over again, from baby steps you’ll build it up but we’ll 
reach this point more quickly tomorrow. We’ll reach it within the first session 
again, which means we can build on that to go to more advanced material, 
which is what tomorrow is all about, but I can’t even go to the advanced 
material until we’ve revivified, until this springs back to life again. 
 
 
You need to understand this because in our self-improvement field, I think 
there is very poor meme, a very poor idea that circulates around and it really 
is harmful to us, and that is the idea that look I’ve changed, I’m cured forever, 
yay. Then you wake up in the morning and say I’m just going to be depressed 
for life, it didn’t work. 
 
 
That’s not how it works. It’s like going to the gym, lifting up the barbell – I’m 
pumped, look at the blood flowing through these muscles – and then the 
adrenaline wears out and you say yeah that was good.  
 
 
Then the next day you come back and you try again and say God this is heavy, 
or you wake up in the morning and say where the hell did my muscles go? It’s 
crazy because it requires time for your body to adapt. 
 
 
We are doing something to change the physical architecture of your brain. 
That is no mean feat folks, and that’s going to require persistence just as 
changing the physical structure of your body requires time. There are no quick 
fixes.

You don’t have the mental equivalent of shoving – you know how they have 
butt implants and for guys they have pec implants? Look, I don’t lift weights 
but I have pecs, which amuses the hell out of me. 
 
 
It’s because we don’t want to work. Here’s the thing. The reason people are 
afraid of working is because it hurts, it’s painful, it’s frustrating and the only 
reason it hurts, it’s painful and it’s frustrating is because they’re either 
working at the wrong pace or doing the wrong thing. 
 
 
Think about your experiences here today. Before today most people in this 
room have had visualizations and at some point have given up on them 
because they were just too hard, too much effort. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
You didn’t get the bliss that the big realization gurus have, like I think of the 
purple turtle and it feels great, power is everywhere, now you do it, think of 
the purple turtle. 
 
 
You can’t even think of a purple turtle let alone feel the power flowing 
through you because it’s not in your symbol, but look where you are right 
now. You’re doing a relatively complex task. You were there for at least 10 or 
15 minutes. That’s a long period of exclusive focus on this. 
 
 
You were so intent that you lost track of real reality as we would call it, but 
now you’re beginning to sense that maybe calling this real reality and that 
not-so-real reality – it starts getting more arbitrary, doesn’t it? What’s really 
real? You’re now starting to learn to navigate different types of realities, and 
that is when you start unlocking the keys that will make your mind do what 
you want it to, when you want it to.  
 
 
The key to this is it was systematic progression and it was easy all the way, 
wasn’t it? Thanks for that. Are there any other comments or questions?  
 
Student: One thing I noticed was – one of the places I went to was an office I haven’t 
been to for quite a few years, and when I first went there it was a complete 
mess. There was a train somewhere in the distance but it was paused in 
motion. Bits of the office were contracted, bits were ridiculously large. As I 
kind of walked around and changed my rotation, things kind of squeezed out 
and became more real. 
 
Igor: 
It started resettling itself and reality starts coming back, right? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
148 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: So, by the time I’d left the place, everything was back to normal. It was the 
right dimensions and the train was moving again. 
 
Igor: 
Now I can’t begin to tell you just how much wonderful stuff has come out of 
that particular experience. Allow me to share a few neurological facts you’ve 
just discovered. I call them facts. They’re true enough that we can call them 
facts because once you start doing this for a while, the question of what is 
really true starts to become very tricky. 
 
 
The first thing is you’ve noticed that motion somehow changes the nature of 
your internal environment. We’ll be playing with this idea of movement more 
tomorrow and definitely on the third day. 
 
 
You’ve also discovered the nature of memory. You are literally re-membering 
your memories. You’re recreating it out of constructed portions of your past 
and there’s some kind of algorithm that your mind uses to make it real. If you 
haven’t used that particular memory for a while, what you end up having is 
like you said this jumbled mess that’s kind of right but not quite. 
 
 
When people struggle at that point, it falls apart further and disappears but 
when they do something different like walking around motion – because 
motion is so fundamental in our everyday experience, I think it has something 
to do in our internal experience as well – it settles things down and suddenly 
the memory traces reconnect themselves. They reconfigure and it becomes 
the memory again. 
 
 
Notice you may have made a mistake in your memory – in other words 
perhaps your desk wasn’t really pink, it was maybe blue. It doesn’t matter. 
The rest of it is true enough that that minor detail is irrelevant. Do you 
understand what I mean by this? 
 
 
You’ve also discovered one other thing and I wish more people knew this. If 
you know someone who has Alzheimer’s or some other disease that 
degenerates the neurology of the brain, the exercise you’re currently 
engaging in will slow down the damage that disease does.  
 
 
It won’t stop the disease. You will have degeneration going on. You need 
other therapies to do that, but what you’re doing is you’re stabilizing the very 
connections that are being destroyed.

Think of it this way. Imagine you lived in a city where there are earthquakes 
constantly destroying roadways. There’s like one of those sinkholes where 
lanes are disappearing from your highways.  
 
 
If your main highway of memory only has two lanes and you lose one of those 
lanes, that’s half your memory gone. You can no longer go down that 
highway. If you lose another lane that’s it, done, no more access to that. You 
can no longer remember anything in relation to that particular part of your 
city. 
 
 
 
What if you built a 7 or 10-lane highway instead? Now if you lose one, it’s not 
such a big deal. It’s not good but it’s not such a big deal. Traffic continues to 
flow. If you lose two or three, you can still continue to function. The more 
lanes you have, the longer it will take to destroy that. 
 
 
If we go with the idea of neuroplasticity and you recreate the lanes that are 
broken down, you can rebuild them again and that process slows down even 
further. Will it halt the disease? I don’t know. I doubt it. I could be wrong. 
Maybe you could do it intensely enough that it could reverse all the negative 
conditions of it, but I personally doubt it. 
 
 
However, I can guarantee you that someone who does this, who works with 
their memories in this sort of way, reinforcing the important memories will 
slow down all the debilitating aspects of that disease and the disease will 
advance much more slowly.  
 
 
So, the really frightening things like losing your sense of self – what is your 
sense of self if not a reflection of the memories that you treasure and value 
and take lessons from, and even the painful ones because they’re part of the 
lessons? 
 
 
If you lose connection to those memories, how do you know who you are? 
How do you know what you think? Do you understand how someone can find 
that kind of disease very frightening? One of the therapies I’ve seen for 
Alzheimer’s – or at least for people coping with Alzheimer’s – is just 
storytelling. 
 
 
It doesn’t work with all people, but they encourage them to tell stories about 
their life. Aren’t you telling a kind of story here without a point really? The 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
150 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
more you are reactivating the neurological circuits, the more they get 
strengthened.  
 
 
The one-lane highway goes to a two-lane highway to a three-lane highway 
and so on, which means you have more there. So, whatever damage comes 
isn’t as damaging. Do you understand where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Again I just want to point out some of the potential of a relatively simple 
process and it’s enjoyable, isn’t it? Thank you for that.  
 
Donna: 
I had two odd experiences. In one of them, I was working with my partner and 
I was describing just the closest landmark, which was a park near my house. 
The park’s nice but it’s got high-tension power lines, which I find creepy.  
 
 
So, I was describing the area and I looked both ways and I thought to myself 
okay I’m done describing this, do I need to be here anymore, and I snapped 
myself out of it because I didn’t want to be into the power lines anymore. So, 
that was one weird thing. The other thing… 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you because you’ve actually jumped probably to the third 
day here in some respects and actually the fourth day in other respects, but 
how would you know? It’s all in my mind. 
 
 
Has she at any point today been exposed to those power lines? Yes or no? Has 
she physically been present in power lines? Is the electromagnetic radiation 
surrounding power lines affecting her in any ways? No, but yet that 
experience has come to symbolize something for you, something unpleasant. 
 
 
In doing so, it has basically contaminated part of your inner landscape. Do you 
mind if we go off topic for a little bit just for the fun of it? Do you want to play 
with something? Is that okay with you, Donna? 
 
Donna: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
What I want you to do if it’s okay with you is I’d like you just to close your 
eyes for a moment – standing or sitting is up to you, I don’t mind. Whatever is 
more comfortable is fine. I’d like you to go ahead and take yourself back to 
the park with the power lines and notice that unpleasant feeling that you 
have.

As you do, do not try to do anything with that feeling. Don’t try to get away. 
Don’t try to do anything. Don’t try to judge it. Just sit with it like you’re doing 
the integration breathing.  
 
 
Remember that flow you had during integration breathing where there’s 
nothing required of you? It’s just you, the park, the power lines and a 
particular feeling but none of this is of any consequence. You’re just curiously 
benignly interested in whatever your mind is creating for you, and just sit with 
that for a while. Just sit with it. 
 
 
When something occurs that is significant for you, please open your eyes and 
we’ll discuss that. Until then just sit with it without any attempt to do 
anything, no attempt to change the scene, no attempt to judge the scene.  
 
 
Let the discomfort be there if it’s there. Let it change if it wishes to change. 
Just sit with it, a nice calm integration type breathing. When something 
happens that maybe surprises you or is somehow significant, just open your 
eyes and we’ll have a chat. There you go. What was that? 
 
Donna: 
I just left again. 
 
Igor: 
You just left again, right? 
 
Donna: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Let’s have a little chat about what’s going on there. What was your 
experience? Just talk me through the experience as you were experiencing 
there? 
 
Donna: 
Those power lines are where I found one of my pets. I found a dog there that I 
had for eight years, and that dog died of cancer last year. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see an extra negative association beginning to build here?  
 
Donna: 
And I’m not sure if the power lines had anything to do with the cancer 
because I live very close to them. 
 
Igor: 
It doesn’t matter. The point is your mind has connected the two. Whether it’s 
real or not is irrelevant. So, it becomes a place of sadness or grief of some sort 
to you. Is that correct? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
152 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Donna: 
Correct. 
 
Igor: 
Let me have this little stab here. As much as you tried to do your integration 
breathing, as you sat there the emotion became almost intolerable, which is 
why you had to leave. Is that correct? 
 
Donna: 
It was more like it was unpleasant but it wasn’t intensifying.  
 
Igor: 
It was hanging out. 
 
Donna: 
I just didn’t think it was going to change unless I left, so I just left. 
 
Igor: 
You just left. Did you want it to change? 
 
Donna: 
I was expecting something to happen but nothing happened. 
 
Igor: 
So, one of two things happened. You’ve actually done the right thing. 
Tomorrow we’ll come onto a little bit more of the rules that we start doing 
with inner landscape.  
 
 
Notice how we started off with just normal stuff and it’s already beginning to 
turn into something actually very symbolic. Can you hear that? Can you feel 
that? The question is what do we do with that symbolism so that something 
healthful can occur as a result of that? 
 
 
To an extent we haven’t developed enough of the neurology around that, so 
now we’re going to really take time to deal with the actual therapeutic 
content, but if it’s not intensifying, if it’s not too much emotion, see if you can 
do the same thing tonight but begin with just the breathing count to shore up 
your dam so to speak. 
 
 
Do your integration breathing. Just relax and enjoy it and then go back to that 
scene and hang out in there. Set your time limit. Say it’s for 10 minutes or 
whatever it is. So, you’re not expecting it to happen within that time limit but 
if something does happen, that’s great. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. 
 
 
If nothing’s happened, repeat it again in the morning before you come here 
and we’ll have another chat. Is that okay with you?

Donna: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
We’ve kind of skipped ahead to the fourth day in some respects, but you’re 
very close to doing something which is really where you can start getting out 
of Bucket Land.  
 
 
You’ve found a loophole out of Bucket Land but it’s only a small one because 
there’s only a small emotion, and getting back out of it will tend to be a 
smaller thing but that’s perfect because it’s not as overloading. Does that 
make sense? 
 
Donna: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that and thanks for playing along. I appreciate that. Give her a 
nice round of applause for that.  
 
Mentalization Games 
 
Igor: 
So, unless there are any other comments, what I want to do is just finish 
today off with a round of fast-paced exercises that are based on exactly the 
same premise, but I’m going to show you how to do this in a way that’s going 
to be less boring over time. 
 
 
In other words, when you get accustomed to doing it one way – which is the 
way you’ve done it so far – after a while it just becomes tedious. So, I want to 
start showing you how you can get creative to take the tediousness out by 
increasing the difficulty, but only in a way that’s commensurate with your skill 
level. Is that okay with you? 
 
 
To do it, I’m going to challenge all of you to do it just sitting in your chairs 
right now with no interaction with your partners for now. For those of you 
who enjoyed doing it that way of course it’s just adding another little extra 
element of skill to the whole thing.  
 
 
Of course eventually you’ll have to do it on your own anyway. Well, I guess 
you could always do it with other people but you have more control if you can 
do it when you want to, where you want to.

Here’s what I’d like you to do. Go ahead and close your eyes everyone and 
think about whatever the room is in your mind that you find the easiest. If 
you’d like to stabilize it, go ahead and point things out to me and mentally 
describe it.  
 
 
Don’t use your external voice now. Use your internal dialog to mentally 
describe it and use your hands and gestures if you need to, to help stabilize it 
even further. 
 
 
This is going to be the most familiar room inside of your house. Your mission 
right now is to start walking around your house, everywhere around your 
house just searching until you find an object that is red. As soon as you find 
the red object, bring it back to your starting room, leave it there and then 
open your eyes and we’ll have a chat. 
 
 
Keep walking around your house until you find an object that’s red. It doesn’t 
matter what it is. It can be as mundane as a sock or as deep and spiritual as an 
apple. As soon as you’ve found one object that’s red, bring it back to your 
starting room and then open your eyes. That’s the only thing you need to do.  
 
 
We’ve got about half of you back so far. All right, I think we have enough 
people back that we can pretty much continue. Who found that interesting? 
Who noticed a different quality to doing that version and the previous ones 
we’ve done so far? Put your hands up please. Let’s have a little chat. What 
was different about it for you? 
 
Student: When you said a red object, it just was right there. I knew which room and it 
was just right there instead of walking somewhere. 
 
Igor: 
So, it was like you teleported straight to the room it was going to be in and 
you could find the object. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did you walk back or did you teleport back to your own room? 
 
Student: I just teleported back. 
 
Igor: 
So, you’re saving time. Good. You’re starting to control your internal 
environment. Notice he doesn’t need the movement, the motion anymore. 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
155 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Sometimes you’ll need the motion to stabilize it but if you don’t need it your 
mind’s taking a shortcut, so you’re learning to no longer be stuck with 
external reality as the only way of maintaining internal reality.  
 
 
Are you beginning to see this? Who else had something similar? Hands up. 
That’s about a third of the room roughly, maybe just a little bit more. Thank 
you for that. What else did you guys notice? 
 
Student: I found that I was quickly walking and scanning every area until something 
popped out and then it was something bizarre that I would have never 
thought of. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. You guys are right on cue. How many people here also discovered 
that you were surprised with either how or what it is that you found? Hands 
up please. That is very gratifying and you’ll understand why tomorrow. 
Excellent. Thank you for that. Who else has something? 
 
Student: Two things happened. The first is just when you said to find the right object, 
something red – a red bowl popped up. I knew it was something I had 
ordered, something that got there when you suggested it, so I discounted it 
and then I found the mixer in the kitchen so now it’s staying in the living 
room.   
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Actually believe it or not of the two, the bowl is more important 
than the mixer. Tomorrow we’ll explain why. Did anyone here notice that they 
were given something that you know doesn’t belong in your house, but your 
mind offered it to you anyway as a quick solution? Hands up. Just a handful of 
you? Excellent. 
 
 
Notice how those are judgment calls. This is not what I want, so I’ll do 
something else, which is fine in terms of the game itself. No big deal there, 
but actually we’re beginning to erode a certain boundary inside your mind 
that we started with today to make things easy. 
 
Student: Actually I took it as a game, so when I noticed it was not… 
 
Igor: 
It just wasn’t in the rules. Exactly. 
 
Student: I said thank you for that, now let’s find something that’s really in the house. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
156 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. In terms of the game, you’re correct. In terms of the skill, the 
bowl has much more use than the mixing bowl. This should be a little mystery 
right now. It’s like a detective novel. We’re slowly starting to work up how 
that works. Did anyone else have an interesting experience like that? 
 
Student: At the beginning I was getting – the whole wall in my house is red, so I put it 
on the washing machine but I thought that’s not an object, so I went back to 
the clothing closet to find a red shirt. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Let me pause you before you carry on from here. I hope you can 
start seeing the unconscious reasoning process in action. His conscious mind 
and his unconscious mind disagree on the rules of this game.  
 
 
His conscious mind and his unconscious mind also disagree on the rules of the 
game. His conscious mind was surprised with how his unconscious mind 
disagreed with the rules of the game but it went with it anyways by 
teleporting. Does that make sense to you? 
 
 
We’re trying to get at the unconscious games we’re playing, because if they 
were conscious then they wouldn’t be a problem for you. It’s all those things 
you don’t have access to consciously – those are the ones that define your life 
in a way that you can’t get past. 
 
 
So, if you’re going to get out of Bucket Land, where are you going to find the 
door out – where you expect it to be or where you don’t? Are you beginning 
to see the value in some of these games? That’s the only reason I’m pointing 
these things out.  
 
 
It’s not because I care whether you bring a wall to your bed. Actually when I 
played this game, I ended up having a fridge on the bed and a TV on top of 
that and all kinds of bizarre stuff, and I thought my God I’m going to have to 
push the ceiling up because there’s no space left. 
 
 
The point is what are the skills you’re developing whilst playing this game on 
the side? I won’t tell you what those are until tomorrow. I just want you to 
notice how your unconscious mind and your conscious mind reason 
differently, as a result of which both of you heard the same instructions, but 
you decided to play the game differently. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Because you’re beginning to have a workable interface with your unconscious 
mind, some of you are beginning to be surprised because your unconscious 
mind is giving you something that you didn’t expect, that you didn’t even ask 
for, but your unconscious mind thinks I asked for it, that’s what the rules of 
the games are, so screw you conscious mind we’re playing it my way. 
 
 
Do you get the idea? This is a very important transition you’re getting to. 
We’re approaching it delicately just so you can tell the nuance. Does it 
invalidate the other experiences you’ve had if you just kind wandered around 
until you found something? Not at all.  
 
 
How many of you were surprised when you finally found the red thing? You 
weren’t actually hunting for it. You were just looking around and eventually 
you found something and you went okay that’s good enough? Hands up. How 
many of you knew ahead of time what you would look for and you just had to 
walk there to find it? Hands up. Excellent. 
 
 
Those of you who found red things spontaneously are doing the same thing in 
a more subtle manner. It just took you longer to basically get your conscious 
mind kind of engrossed in the game enough for your unconscious mind to say 
go in this room next.  
 
 
These are very subtle distinctions that you’re starting to make but they’re the 
important ones. Do you understand what I’m trying to say? Thank you. Did 
you have a follow-up to that? 
 
Student: Yes, I did. The thing that has changed is that it feels like I’m flying through the 
house. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. 
 
Student: I was like a bird that kind of flew very quickly off the house, flying and looking 
in the neighbor’s house and everything.  
 
Igor: 
He’s looking in the neighbor’s house. Now you see because I’ve introduced 
the format of a game, different rules apply and a different world’s been 
opened up, hasn’t it?

Notice how quickly you went from visualizing to mentalizing and a different 
world can be built around that, which was none of the failures that 
visualizations include. 
 
 
Now we’ve turned it into a game, which again changes the rules and you 
spontaneously are adapting your internal environment to win at the game. 
Isn’t that what we do? We win at games. As long as we understand what the 
rules are, we get better at them. 
 
 
If we’re told one set of rules but actually the game is played by a different set 
of rules, that’s when it gets really nasty. That’s where people get really 
confused. Do you know the triangle game? No?  
 
 
If I make a triangle from him to him to myself, whose triangle is that? It’s 
mine. If I make a triangle from over here to that pillar to the screen, whose 
triangle is that? That’s mine as well. If I make it from the door all the way to 
the back wall and all the way to the window, whose triangle is that? It’s yours. 
 
 
Who here is now hopelessly confused? This is how the game of life works. 
Tomorrow if you ask me very nicely, I will play the game again with you and 
eventually I’ll tell you the actual hidden rule behind the game. In a lot of life 
you’re told a certain set of rules will make you succeed, but the actual rules by 
which that game is played are different. 
 
 
So, the harder you try to play by the rules you’ve been given, the more you 
will fail. Those people who actually work out the actual rules underneath it 
will have enough of a psychotic insight to say oh those aren’t the real rules; 
those are the rules that everyone else is playing by.  
 
 
That’s when you suddenly start succeeding. That’s something else that your 
unconscious mind can give you but let’s have some fun with it and play more 
tomorrow on that one.  
 
Student: It’s probably irrelevant because you talked about it, but what happened to 
me, like one red object ended up on my table and then on its own there was a 
pile of them without me doing it. 
 
Igor: 
They multiplied by themselves, correct? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
Once again your unconscious mind really wanted you to win this game. 
 
Student: My question was the moment you said the word red, I knew exactly which 
object I needed and it’s on the top of a high clock, and I found myself reaching 
for it and then I realized I was hovering and my mind went that’s not right. So, 
I suddenly found myself back on the floor walking to the kitchen knocking a 
chair over, but then I thought hey,… 
 
Igor: 
Why am I bothering? 
 
Student: Exactly, and I’m hovering up again. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just re-describe what you just told me without the content. I was 
engaged in the process where my conscious mind and my unconscious mind 
were conflicting. My conscious mind decided it knew better, so it decided to 
make life really difficult for myself by doing it the way I consciously thought it 
was meant to be done.  
 
 
Eventually, seeing that I have a good enough rapport with my unconscious 
mind, I got out of my way and let my unconscious mind do it, and it became 
so much easier and actually more fun too. Would that be fair to say? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Now if you apply that principle to different areas in your life that are 
problematic, I suspect your life would be a lot easier and a lot more fun 
because you already know the solution. It’s just you think you know better. By 
the way, I don’t mean you. I mean me and everyone else in this room as well. 
You understand that, right? 
 
 
Isn’t this a wonderful way to discover some very important psychological 
truths to the extent that we can call it a truth, rather than sitting through a 
Freudian lecture for 12 hours where you’re really worried about whether or 
not you really do have unhealthy desires about your mother? 
 
 
There are only two purposes of this these mentalization games.  
 
1. To build a certain mental muscle. 
2. To begin detecting nuances on how our minds operate.

My job is to help you spot them so that they don’t get lost in the metaphor 
and you start understanding what’s actually going on, and you start getting 
empowered by it because then you start trusting your unconscious mind, 
don’t you? Wasn’t it a lot easier the first time round when you hovered?  
 
 
We’re going to wrap up in a minute but what I want to do before we do that is 
just a couple of quick extra games, just to give you some ideas of how you can 
extend this so that you don’t get stuck on one level of this – and maybe we’ll 
play some more tomorrow morning. 
 
 
Everyone close your eyes. Start in whatever room you wish to again. By now it 
should be so familiar and so easy to do. This time you want to hunt around 
the house until you find whatever object that begins with the letter A. Go. 
 
 
Open your eyes when you’ve found it and brought it back to your starting 
room. That was quick. Nice. You’re speeding up now. This is great. Very good. 
All right, about half the room is back so far. Okay most of you are back now, 
so carry on hunting if you want but kind of listen in the back of your mind as 
we’re doing this. 
 
 
Overall would it be fair to say that essentially the same game was faster the 
second time around than the first time around? It wasn’t for everyone, I 
know, but we’re only looking for tendencies; we’re not looking for absolutes 
because there are very few absolutes in life.  
 
 
Secondly, this game was actually harder than the previous one. Who noticed 
that also? Who noticed that it was easier to make associations to red and find 
things and think of them ahead of time, whereas with the letter A you were 
more forced to wander around until something jumped out at you? 
 
 
Who noticed that jumping out process? Let me get your version of it instead. 
Talk to me a little bit about how you discovered something that starts with 
the letter A. How did you find it? 
 
Student: I found I had to do a sort of conscious process first to find an object that 
began with A, and then it was like A is for apple.

Igor: 
And then it was easy. So, you first had to consciously translate it to make it in 
a way that’s easy for your unconscious mind to discover. Would that be fair to 
say? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s one way to cheat and you can work with it. It’s absolutely fine. Who 
knows? I didn’t define the rules, and that’s actually a good way to do it 
because now you’re using co-consciousness. Your conscious mind does part of 
the game and your unconscious mind does another part of the game. 
 
 
Who had the opposite experience? Who just walked around until something 
just jumped out at them and they discovered oh this is great? Stand up and 
let’s have a chat. 
 
Student: You said just an object with A and immediately an apple popped up, and then 
I thought well that’s a bit boring and was annoyed with myself and I just took 
it. 
 
Igor: 
Once again do you see the conscious/unconscious dissociation going on here? 
That’s not good enough. But then once you accepted it, that’s all that we 
required. 
 
 
This is the important thing. Notice how you treated your mind – and this is not 
a judgment call, by the way, because we all do this. I do this as much as 
anyone else. There are a couple of you here who within seconds had it and 
came right back.  
 
 
You could have been one of them. Your unconscious went great this is a 
game, I know how to play it, here’s an apple, go quickly, get it, get it – no 
that’s too boring. 
 
 
Now let us suppose that you were a child and you were playing a game. Your 
parents said let’s play a game and you’re so excited. Then they say something 
with the letter A – oh an apple. No that’s too boring. What’s just happened to 
the child’s enthusiasm? How good is this game now? 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Please, I do not mean this in any way as 
a judgment call because we all do this to ourselves. The reason I like that

example is because it demonstrates exactly how we really fuck up our 
relationships with ourselves because we’re mean. 
 
 
If we treated other people the way we treat ourselves, most of us would have 
no friends and some of us would be in prison. This is so important but it just 
seems like God no, no, no, not good enough. Do you see where I’m going with 
this? Did you understand? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
By the way, there’s no difference. Everyone in this room has done this in one 
way or another, but isn’t this a much more friendly way of discovering and 
seeing the pattern so that you’re not locked into it? 
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll discuss more of why that damages us so much. Even though 
that’s a very small and minor thing, the nature of that damage can be 
extrapolated in other areas of our life where we do much more of this. 
 
 
I also want to show you – which is kind of where you’re going a little bit and 
we’ll see how the exercise I’ve asked you to do tonight is going to work out 
for you. It may work out and it may not. I honestly don’t care. It doesn’t 
matter. It’s an experiment. 
 
 
Whether or not it works out tonight with the parameters I’ve given you so far, 
by the time we come onto the idea tomorrow, I can almost guarantee it will 
work out with this. Then it’s just a question of time, but that’s for tomorrow. 
It’s not for today. 
 
Student: First of all I visualized where I was standing in the room, and then my 
conscious mind kicked in and I’m thinking apple, no, I haven’t got any of 
those. Africa, that won’t work. Agile? Then I thought no, this isn’t working at 
all for me. I started looking around and saw my amplifier right behind it. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Are you beginning to see what I’m talking about now? Are you 
beginning to understand the symbolic landscape? Can you sense the 
symbolism – conscious mind failed, conscious mind failed, conscious mind 
failed. Unconscious mind, you do it. I’m going to look around – in other words 
I’m going to trust you. Would you have thought of an amplifier in a million 
years consciously?

Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
No and that’s the power of learning to trust your unconscious. This is a silly 
game. I understand. This will not transform your life. I totally put my hands 
up, you’re right, you caught me. This has failed as far as hitting nirvana goes, 
but that’s not the important part of the game. It is doing several things 
spontaneously.  
 
 
Who’s having fun? Did everyone enjoy that game? Are you more likely to play 
that game if it’s fun or if it’s serious? So, you’re enthused to do more of it, 
which means you’re practicing. 
 
 
Secondly, you’re building a certain kind of muscle. You’re building your 
mentalization skills. You’re building your focus, your attention, your 
awareness.  
 
 
Thirdly, you’re beginning to heal, learning where am I violating my 
relationship with my unconscious mind, with myself essentially, so that I can 
start stopping it, which is exactly what you did. 
 
 
Now it’s okay to rack your brains and say hey a little help here please. Oh 
there we go. That’s just fine. That’s how life works because your conscious 
mind does have a role to play, and more so today than in more traditional 
hypnosis type settings. 
 
 
The point however is you’re beginning to learn to trust your unconscious. 
Wouldn’t that be fair to say? You’re beginning to learn that you are good 
enough just the way you are. You just haven’t realized it yet and when you do, 
all those things that aren’t good enough will suddenly not be there anymore 
because they were.  
 
 
It’s one of those strange paradoxes that very few of you right now kind of 
understand. You’re just going to say what the hell is he talking about but he’s 
up there and I’m sitting down here, so he must know what he’s talking about. 
 
 
My hope is that by the end of our time together in five days’ time, you will all 
have had an experience of that paradox in action and you’ll realize it’s not 
one. It’s just your thinking has to change.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

You have to go to a different style of consciousness for you to resolve the 
paradox. Does that make sense to you? The appropriate answer is no but I 
trust you. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: Is it thinking if it just jumps into your mind? 
 
Igor: 
Did it work for you? 
 
Student: It did. 
 
Igor: 
There you go. You just got it. You’re learning to trust your unconscious in 
other ways. Some of you will walk around. Like the amplifier, it just jumped at 
you didn’t it? How it jumps at you is a different matter.  
 
 
For you, the thought or the word might be in your mind, like the apple. Did 
you see the apple in your mind or did you see the word in your mind? 
 
Student: Both. 
 
Igor: 
So, it was like a voice and an object at the same time. Perfect. Some people 
will just have the word, which is what you were thinking implies. I suspect 
that’s what happened to you. You had a little bit of both – a visual. 
 
Student: Written and... 
 
Igor: 
Oh, it was written and the actual object. So, it wasn’t actually the sound of it, 
right? Notice how many different ways you can start getting messages from 
your unconscious that can be of great value to you, not the traditional ways. 
 
 
I presume yours was visual. In other words, you looked around and it just 
arrested your attention. Let me make another guess here because this is how 
it typically works.  
 
 
When your attention was arrested on it, at first you didn’t know why you 
were looking at this thing, and if you had gone down the other path you 
would have ignored it and said this is no good, let’s carry on, I need something 
with an A. It’s there. Why am I looking at this? What the hell am I look at the 
amplifier for? I need something that starts with an A. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
165 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
I’ve done this by the way. This is not a joke. I need something that starts with 
an A, God damn it. You know, like an apple. There’s no apple in this house. 
What else starts with an A? Amplifier? 
 
 
That by the way is the self-delusion chain in action, to answer the question 
from before again. Do you see how very small experiences have buried within 
them the microcosm of very large problems in our lives? Who’s enjoying 
themselves? Has this been valuable? Do you have a follow-up to that? 
 
Student: I do. The apple was in another country. 
 
Igor: 
I never said you can’t leave the house, did I?  
 
Arthur: 
When you said that, I thought of apple also and then I realized that I didn’t 
have any apples, so then I thought accordion. I knew I have an accordion but I 
couldn’t remember where the heck I put it. So, I started looking all over the 
house to see where it was. 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you a second? Did you end up finding something else with the 
letter A? 
 
Arthur: 
No, I’m still looking for the accordion.  
 
Igor: 
You guys are so good. I love this. So, how do you resolve this dilemma? Who 
here can see his dilemma? I know you can’t yet but I’ll explain what it is. Can 
anyone see what the dilemma is right here?  
 
 
It’s the same dilemma as over here. He’s stuck on the accordion. He’s doing 
the reverse. Apple is not good enough. His unconscious mind is saying 
accordion, that’s lame I’ve got something better waiting for you. But whilst 
he’s stuck looking for the accordion, his unconscious mind is saying nope, 
nope. Listen to me. Look around. What are you talking about? 
 
Arthur: 
I was thinking should I drop the idea of accordion and find something else 
with an A, but I was sort of upset that I couldn’t remember where it is. 
 
Igor: 
Who is starting to appreciate how much you can learn from simple things? 
You just have to understand symbolism and this is very low level symbolism. 
You understand this, right? It’s very low level symbolism, but it’s enough for 
us to start appreciating just how rich our minds can really be.

There are many variations of the game that we’ll play as we go along, but I 
just want you to start appreciating your minds a bit more because we 
disrespect them enough.  
 
 
When they work well, we ignore them. When they don’t work so well, we 
hate them. Is it any wonder that we sometimes have troubles in life when we 
put that kind of stuff on ourselves? Thank you for that, Arthur.  
 
Student: I thought you said H, so I’m standing in my living room and I’m looking at the 
coat rack and there’s a hat sitting on the coat rack. This was all within two or 
three seconds. Then something said to me was it H or was it A? Then I looked 
on the table and I saw a bowl of apples. I thought what’s happened there? 
 
Igor: 
And you had no idea why you had apples, except when you came back and we 
started our discussions, it suddenly started making sense. Once again do you 
see the unconscious mind in action?  
 
 
It corrected a conscious mistake, which is partly an unconscious mistake, by 
the way, because in order to process language and so on – I know it gets very 
complicated, so let’s not worry about that too much but just notice how our 
minds – if we learn to trust them – start doing things.  
 
 
The more we learn to trust that, especially when it’s unexpected, surprising 
and maybe even a little bit unwelcomed – that’s when you start realizing this 
is pay dirt. We’re hitting the material we need to have. Let’s call this the 
process of discovery. 
 
 
The process of discovery is one of the key rules for the work we’re going to 
do. Tomorrow I want to introduce you to the seven rules of Flight Club, the 
seven things that you can do whilst working through mental landscapes, 
through symbolic landscapes that will not only build the relationship with 
your unconscious, but will allow you to start doing other things that are even 
more powerful. 
 
 
Let me give you a quick example of what I mean, just to wax lyrical. This is 
something I was saving for later but this is such a great example, I just want to 
give it to you anyways.

Again, a member of the beta group – when I was teaching this one on one, I 
taught this individual a combative exercise. It’s kind of like if you take the idea 
of martial arts and took away most of the stuff that doesn’t work so well, 
you’re left with some very simple rules. 
 
 
This is an exercise that is simple. It takes five minutes to explain. It takes 
about 20 minutes to kind of get the hang of it, and then we spent about two 
hours just practicing it just for the fun of it, just because it amused me and he 
was interested. 
 
 
Then disconnected from this, later he became a part of my beta group for the 
ASH Method. A game that we developed, which we won’t be playing here just 
because it was just relevant because I knew his interests, is a game I call 
Zombie Apocalypse.  
 
 
As you can imagine, zombies were coming and he was playing the combative 
exercise with them. We’ll go more into the nuances of that in due course, not 
the particular game but just how to play it. So, he played it to amuse himself 
because he enjoyed the training and he wanted to continue to some degree. 
 
 
So, he played it just to amuse himself whilst he had five minutes waiting for a 
phone call or whatever it was. He’s just playing five or 10 minutes at a time. 
Sometimes when there’s a longer period, he might play for half an hour but 
really it’s just mostly five or 10-minute slices. 
 
 
Over the course of about three months, he played it in total less than 10 
hours, so it was not very long. Literally two weeks and three days ago – it was 
on a Sunday – I got the email on a Monday. He has to go to work. He’s got to 
pick up a couple of things. He promised some people some things.  
 
 
He walks out of his office and goes to get in his car, and it’s in an abandoned 
car park, one of these big parking lot things – because no one goes to work on 
the weekend in his particular area. 
 
 
He hears a woman shouting and she sounds frightened, so he dials for the 
emergency services. He doesn’t call through. He doesn’t know what it is yet 
but he gets his phone ready just because it sounds a little worrying and he 
goes to check it out.

What he sees is a woman lying on the ground, a man on top of her and some 
very bad things are about to happen and it’s very obvious, and she’s terrified. 
So, of course he gets the emergency operator and explains what’s going on. 
She says the police are on their way, they’ll be there in three minutes or 
whatever, do not get involved! He says you don’t have to tell me. 
 
 
The man hears him, stands up and says who’s there? So, he’s very quiet. He 
approaches my student and he’s getting really worried. He starts backing off. 
He says what are you doing? He said I just called the police. You’d better go 
because they’ll be here any minute now. 
 
 
He’s on something. His pupils are dilated and all that sort of stuff, so he’s not 
being very rational. This is my favorite part. He’s backing off further because 
he really doesn’t want to get involved. He just wants the police to come, so 
they can deal with this because this guy’s a little bit nuts. 
 
 
That must have primed something in his mind because he turns around to him 
and says I know Kung Fu and I’m crazy! I swear to God he actually said this. 
Maybe he said I’m a black belt and I’m crazy or something like that, anyway 
the guy doesn’t care. He comes in to attack him. 
 
 
I won’t shock you with the details but long story short he broke his leg and 
broke three ribs. The police arrive and as far as he’s concerned, time just 
slowed down and he was totally calm.  
 
 
Everything is just lighting up for him. He knows exactly what to do. It’s over in 
a split second but it feels like half an hour. He has all the time in the world. 
He’s totally relaxed. The police come and time crashes in on him again. He 
goes off to a corner to have the adrenaline dump. 
 
 
When adrenaline hits your system and then it comes out again you get the 
shakes, you get very emotional, tears come out and so on. So, he asked for a 
moment to let that happen. The shakes go, the tears come out, he’s relaxed 
again and he talks to the police. 
 
 
A simple game he played inside his mind saved both his life and another 
person’s life, but to get to that point he wasn’t just visualizing a fight. He was 
trusting his unconscious, and his unconscious filled in all the other details 
because once the adrenaline dump kicks in, it’s almost impossible to separate 
yourself from it enough to be so clear and so lucid.

His mind defaulted to that despite the lack of experience. Isn’t this 
interesting? Are you beginning to have a sense that on the surface the 
relatively trivial but fun games we’ve been playing so far have a lot of 
potential value?  
 
 
And we haven’t even scratched the surface yet. We’ve only been preparing 
you for the stuff that we want to do tomorrow. Is anyone here a little bit 
excited? Good. 
 
 
We’ll take two questions here and then we’ll save the rest for tomorrow so 
that we can go home because it’s starting to get quite late right now. So, go 
ahead. 
 
Student: You were talking about whose rules you are living your life by, so that hit 
something inside me because sometimes I’m making decisions for my life and 
I’m visualizing and dreaming about yeah this would be really great, but then I 
say no you’re not allowed to. That is a family member I have. It’s my older 
brother. So, then I have a big conflict in my mind. 
 
Igor: 
What you just described and what’s very interesting is the way the walls of 
Bucket Land are maintained. Some of those walls are maintained for your 
protection.  
 
 
Some of those walls are maintained because there are other constructs that 
are limiting – self-limiting beliefs, conclusions and stuff like that – and I’ll 
show you how to get past them. 
 
 
Remember the student I told you about who is now just on this massive 
career track? Remember him? He had exactly the same problem and that’s 
why he was sitting on his couch.  
 
 
I’m sure he won’t mind me saying this, but it was also his brother who was the 
one that said good, fail, and he said it in a very nasty unpleasant sort of way.  
 
 
That is the doorway out of Bucket Land, only we haven’t discussed how to 
deal with that yet. I appreciate that and I’m not going to do it too soon 
because we need to build in lots of safety mechanisms first. You need to be 
able to navigate the layers as we go through.

We’ve just gone through the first level. Tomorrow I want to get to the second 
level of learning, and when we’ve got three levels clear then we can start 
doing something practical with it. Does that make sense to you?  
 
 
We’ll take one last thing in the back and then we’ll come back to you 
tomorrow. Otherwise we’ll be here forever but I am glad to see the 
excitement.  
 
Student: I just want to say that the exercise for A – because it was pretty amusing. 
When my eyes looked around for the A, it looked at the vacuum cleaner and 
that’s called an aspirateur. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: And then my mind said that’s cheating. [laughter] 
 
Igor: 
Are you beginning to see how this works? We are defining our own limitations 
by those very kinds of thoughts – I can’t do that, that can’t work, that’s not 
realistic. Do you see where I’m going with this?  
 
 
Even though we’ve only started scratching the surface of the ASH Method, 
who here feels they have learned something of tremendous value just today 
alone? Put your hands up. 
 
 
So, even if you were to go home today, would you feel satisfied that you’ve 
learned enough that it’s been worth your coming here? Hands up. Good, but 
come back tomorrow. [Applause] All right, you can come back tomorrow now.

Igor: 
I hope you noticed that what we did yesterday, especially the last game – the 
sort of treasure hunt where you looked for something that was red and 
something that starts with the letter A and so on – these are just games you 
can play with yourself in order to increase the challenge to some degree. 
 
 
As soon as you find yourself getting bored with it, what do you do? You 
change the nature of the game. If you want, I can give you some ideas around 
how to do that but really these are just examples of how you can create your 
own games to work with your own mind. 
 
 
I’m sure that all of you will find many ways to amuse yourselves whilst doing 
this sort of stuff over the course of the next years which aren’t necessarily on 
this list.  
 
 
This is more of an example of the kind of things to do, rather than an 
exhaustive list – at least these are the kind of games I played with myself 
whilst practicing these myself. 
 
 
Of course we’ve got the treasure hunt in terms of color. We’ve got different 
things of color and that just gives you an unconscious cue as to which things 
to look for. We can go with textures. Things like hard or soft. You can go with 
materials – metal, glass, wood. 
 
 
Notice that these are different ways of organizing information. One of my 
favorite games takes a long time to play. I call it the Alphabet Game. You see 
where I’m going with this now, right?   
 
 
I wouldn’t necessarily recommend starting with the Alphabet Game because it 
took me a long time to finish it the first time, but if just hunting for letters is 
getting too simple for you, then hunt for two or three. There are all kinds of 
different variations you can have with it.

The point is you’re constantly challenging your mind to do a little bit more. 
You don’t have to be stuck at this level. This is just the first level of the 
training. We’ve got about five that I want to introduce you to.  
 
 
The point of being able to vary each level is so that if you want to improve a 
particular aspect of your skill – let’s say in this case it’s just the visualization 
part of it, the mentalization part of it to stabilize the images – then you need 
to play the games. The more you play the games, the more the skill will 
develop. 
 
 
It’s important in my mind to make it more game-like because the reward has 
been built in. You’re more likely to do it. Let’s take an example. Let’s think of 
children, for example. Are they more likely to sit down for an hour and think 
of nothing or play a videogame?  
 
 
If you extrapolate that to adults, I think most people are more likely to play 
videogames for an hour to amuse themselves than to sit down and think of 
nothing, which is the traditional way that meditations are perceived, although 
I could say misperception. Do you all get the idea of how to expand your first 
level of mentalizations?  
 
 
So, let’s start this morning off by doing some more work. Then I want you to 
contrast today’s work against yesterdays. We’re going to go at it cold at first 
and then we’re going to find ways of warming things up. I’ll show you what I 
mean in a second. 
 
 
You’re welcome to do this with a partner again as you did yesterday, or if you 
want to do it on your own you’re welcome to do that again. It’s true for the 
whole course – you’re welcome to do it with a partner or on your own. I 
recommend that as the course progresses, you become increasingly self-
reliant – in other words you work less with a partner and more with yourself. 
 
 
However, if that starts becoming too difficult or tedious for you, then go back 
to working with a partner because again it just helps stabilize things a bit 
more. Talking with your internal dialog is a little less stable than talking out 
loud to an actual person. It’s just the kind of makeup that we have. 
 
 
The first thing we’re going to do is if you want to work with a partner today, 
please turn to someone next to you and see if they want to work with you 
also.

We’re going to go at the first exercise cold just to see a contrast between 
yesterday, and then we’ll see what happens when you do to a warm-up. I’d 
like you with your partner or on your own to do a tour of your neighborhood, 
just as you did yesterday. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, we’re already out on the sidewalk. We turn right and there’s actually a 
small gallery on the corner with different kinds of artwork all the time. We 
turn around the corner and we can see the charging station for the electric 
cars. 
 
 
When we continue up the street, there’s actually a gate into the house that’s 
connected with my house that has a lot of warning signs. What would you call 
it? It’s apartments for people who serve their sentence and are about to get 
released into society. That grabbed my mind. 
 
 
If we continue up the street, we’ll get to the park – the Park of Ruins it’s 
called, old ruins from the 12th Century or the 13th Century, old stuff. If we walk 
into the park and still around my block, around my neighborhood, there’s a 
playground, some ruins, not much to see really but if we turn right again, we’ll 
go down a slope in the park and soon if we continue down the road we’ll be 
back at my home. 
 
Student: That’s a good stopping point. Take a breath.  
 
Igor: 
Comparing the way you did this yesterday – you’re basically just repeating an 
exercise from yesterday, correct? How do they compare, just now versus 
yesterday?  
 
Student: It was just dimmer oddly enough. 
 
Igor: 
Dimmer, right? 
 
Student: It was just dimmer. There was less detail. It was like the day was darker. 
 
Igor: 
Did anyone else notice something like this? Hands up. Very good. Who else 
wants to say something? Go ahead.

Student: After I got halfway through – I was doing it on my own today – and I got very 
bored with what I was doing and I started listening to the lady behind me and 
paying more attention to her. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, the boredom is a sign that it’s too easy for you, so you start 
adding… 
 
Student: It wasn’t interesting exploring the neighborhood because it’s too familiar. 
 
Igor: 
In that case, you go through something which is a greater challenge – for 
example a neighborhood you’re less familiar with or a treasure hunt or 
something like that. 
 
 
For the moment, we’re just trying to get some baseline readings for 
comparison. Did you have the same experience but overall it was a little more 
difficult than yesterday, like dimmer and not as vivid? 
 
Student: Not really. It was just too familiar, I think. It was too easy. I should have done 
something more difficult. 
 
Igor: 
Fine. We’ll get a whole bunch of things happening here over the course of 
today. I just want to point out a few things. You’re learning a skill. Like with 
any skill, once you kind of get into the groove of it you’re very good at it, but if 
it’s a new skill then if you get away from it for a while and come back to it, it 
will initially be rough, so you need to warm up again – and we’ll do a little bit 
of a warm-up in a moment for that. 
 
 
Once the skill starts getting engrained – habituated if you like – it starts 
becoming easy and that’s when simple exercises like the neighborhood start 
getting boring. That’s when you start having to add things to it to keep your 
interest level up. 
 
 
I’ve come up with dozens of different types of games, different treasure hunts 
and so on just because of that same thing. Later on I’ll show you how to do 
some more things with it and go to a different level but it’s always good to 
come back to basics again. 
 
 
For example, we’re going to the second level today where we’re going to be 
doing more spontaneous work. By the way, a warning to you at home, if 
you’re just watching this and not actually doing the exercises, you’re going to

get quite lost today. By tomorrow you’ll have no clue what’s going on and 
forget the fourth day. 
 
 
You need to have the reference experiences for the stuff that we’ll be talking 
about to actually make sense, so I strongly recommend you actually do the 
exercises. Otherwise you’ll just be watching very bizarre things going on here. 
 
 
As they start becoming boring for you, I want you to really remember this 
diagram from yesterday. I will leave it up to you to add something into the 
mix to make it more interesting for yourself – either you go through a 
different neighborhood or you add a little challenge to yourself. 
 
 
For example, the first version I did is I walked through the regular 
neighborhood and instead of doing a treasure hunt, I just started counting all 
the things that were a certain color – for example red and so on – just to keep 
the challenge level up. Does that make sense? Thank you for sharing that. 
 
Student: I found it quite easy. It was almost images that I was seeing more than 
discussing something with myself. I got three-quarters of the way around and 
I started to lose interest. So, I went back to my breathing and then I free-
wheeled and then my interest was there again and I could on. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Very good. 
 
Student: So, I did. 
 
Igor: 
We’ll talk about how to include the breathing count and the integration 
breathing a little later today but you’re a little ahead of the game, so that’s 
excellent. I like to hear that. 
 
Arthur: 
I woke up this morning about 3:00 o’clock and so I decided to do this exercise, 
but I did it in great detail. So, I went through every room in my house and it 
took about an hour.  
 
 
Then I went through every room in my parents’ house where I grew up, and I 
realized first of all I’d never done anything like that before and I saw it in an 
entirely different way and that took about an hour. So, it was about two hours 
of actually detailed going through each thing and trying to remember if this 
was there or not. Then after I was all done, I started having visual 
hallucinations.

Igor: 
Awesome. It makes sense because you’d been priming it. There are a whole 
bunch of things going on there. The first thing is because it’s nighttime and 
because you’re half asleep, your whole brain chemistry is already altered, so 
you’re much closer to dreams and the ability to have what’s called a lucid 
dream – you’re really fudging the boundaries there. 
 
 
In fact one of the ways to induce a lucid dream in yourself from the conscious 
state is the kind of stuff that we’re doing here. For those of you who don’t 
know, a lucid dream is a dream where you wake up in the dream and you 
realize you’re having a dream.  
 
 
You’re actually totally conscious and you know you’re having a dream, and 
basically at that point you just do whatever you want. It’s a great place to be. 
When you start getting good at this practice, you will be able to create a lucid 
dream in any state of consciousness. 
 
 
In other words, you can be sitting on the bus with your eyes open and totally 
enjoy it. You can be going to sleep and enjoying it or any context whatsoever. 
That’s when we start using it for actual practical purposes. So, 
congratulations. 
 
Student: Did he find his accordion? 
 
Igor: 
There’s a little music shop down the road.  
 
Student: When I did this tour of my neighborhood, I started actually to follow my 
intuition more and I started to deviate from the way I was going. So, I started 
to go into houses where I have been years ago and that was interesting. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Now you’re slowly starting to build the relationship with your 
unconscious and learning to pay attention to certain things. That intuition that 
you’re talking about is actually part of what the prefrontal cortex does.  
 
 
Remember we talked about the prefrontal cortex yesterday? The nine 
functions, the nine different specialties shall we say, the different areas of the 
prefrontal cortex – which is this part of your brain over here – does are: 
 
1. To regulate your body. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
177 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
2. To build emotional connections with others – have a feeling of 
rapport. 
 
 
If you ever felt alienated or you don’t know someone, that’s this thing here. 
I’ll give you a quick example. There’s a particular condition when a part of the 
prefrontal cortex is injured where people will see their loved ones but think 
that they’re imposters.  
 
 
The reason they think they’re imposters is because their rapport part of the 
brain has broken down and they see the person, but because they can’t feel 
the feelings they normally have – which they remember having in the past – 
their mind reasons that it must be because they’re fake, that they’re aliens or 
imposters or spies or whatever it is and it can be very traumatic for them. 
 
 
Sometimes it’s only a visual thing. For example, when they hear them they’ll 
feel connected and when they see them they don’t. It’s a very complicated 
piece of machinery there but you get an idea of what we’re talking about 
here, right? 
 
3. Then we have emotional balance. 
 
 
This is one of the big keys to self-mastery. Just doing the kind of work that 
we’re doing here – especially the mindful breathing stuff – is going to help 
you with your emotional balance.  
 
4. Extinguishing fear. 
 
 
We’ve talked about this before. That’s your safety valve for all the work we’ll 
be doing in the next few days. 
 
5. Pausing before you act. 
 
 
This is a huge one. How many times have you done something you regretted 
afterwards? This is one of the ways that we learn that it’s important to pause. 
Some people don’t have that mental pause button. They just do whatever it is 
and then afterwards tell themselves oh, I wish I hadn’t done that. 
 
 
Interestingly enough, when children were taught to meditate in a very basic 
way – for example one of the fun ones that I really enjoyed hearing about was 
in preschool, like four-year-olds and five-year-olds and so on. 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

They put a teddy bear on their belly and told them to rock the teddy bear to 
sleep. So, they’re watching the teddy bear intensely whilst their breathing 
goes up and down, but of course a form of metacognition is going on.  
 
 
The interesting thing is when something like that occurs, those children – the 
level of bullying in that preschool age group goes down dramatically. Why? 
It’s because two things are happening.  
 
 They’re pausing before doing something. 
 
 Popping down a few ones, their empathy, reading other people’s 
emotions and predicting the social impact of that starts coming in. 
 
 
So, very simple things can actually have very positive effects on people. The 
next one is: 
 
6. Ethics. 
 
 
Believe it or not, your sense of reality is again in the prefrontal cortex. People 
who have had that particular area injured don’t suddenly become depraved. 
What they become is amoral. In other words, one action is as good as 
another. 
 
 
Crossing the street is as useful as kicking someone in the shins or shooting 
them. The only reason that they would conform to ethical behavior at that 
point is because of the legal system. If you think about what a psychotic is, 
one of their deficiencies is they have no ethics. Their moral code doesn’t exist.  
 
 
It’s just that their brain is defective in some way that doesn’t allow them to 
have the same kind of moral check that we have. Some people define the 
ethics thing as an eye for social consequences.  
 
 
Finally, we have: 
 
7. The intuition portion. 
 
 
This is really what I was talking about here. If you imagine your spinal column, 
you have a whole bunch of little threads going through, which go to different 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
179 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
parts of the brain. One of those threads is called lamina one. You know you 
have three different brains. 
 
 
You have the reptilian brain. You have the mammalian brain, which is your 
emotional brain. Around that you have what people call the human brain – 
the cortex and neural cortex.  
 
 
The lamina one goes through the body. It attaches to the hollow organs – the 
heart, the lungs and so on – and it touches on all three brains – the brainstem, 
the mammalian brain, the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex. 
 
 
This is the place where we get our intuitions from. Your hollow organs have 
nerve clusters around them that work very much like small brains, so when 
you have an intuition it almost is as though another brain has processed 
information in a way that you don’t normally process things, and it’s giving 
you information that you don’t normally have access to. 
 
 
Once again, these are all very useful both for mental balance and also for 
success in life. Can you see how that would work? 
 
Student: What are the hollow organs? 
 
Igor: 
The hollow organs are the heart, the lungs and the intestines – in other words 
the organs that are hollow. Don’t worry. You’ll get a set of these notes. I just 
want you to get a sense of how much is being activated by just very simple 
practices.  
 
 
As long as you keep them amusing and interesting for yourself, you’ll keep 
doing them and if you keep doing them, you’re slowly starting to build mental 
muscles. Make sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I had a bit of resistance initially to doing the whole neighborhood thing. So, I 
thought okay I’ll take the dog out for a walk and just let him take me 
wherever he wants to go. We went to a field that he likes to play in. 
 
 
In one moment I was there watching him playing in the field and suddenly I 
was a child in India, but I could hear my mom in the background going you 
have to be careful of the dogs because they’ve got rabies and you have to run 
like hell. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
180 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That kind of went on for a while until suddenly I thought hang on a moment, 
I’m in the wrong place. Then suddenly I was back in the field and carried on. It 
was just very, very bizarre. 
 
Igor: 
Welcome to the world of the bizarre. You have actually preempted the next 
two days of work so well done. I’m serious. What you basically had is a pure 
unconscious experience.  
 
 
You started it consciously with a particular intention and your unconscious 
mind took you somewhere else. Now where it becomes useful, where it 
becomes important is when you find that co-conciousness, the idea where 
you both get to decide what’s going on.  
 
 
You set the theme if you like, and your unconscious mind goes down that 
particular path. Sometimes it will tell you no; in order to achieve this you need 
to go down a different path. It’s a very subtle skill that you have to start 
learning and a lot of you are starting to get this. 
 
 
Some of you got it yesterday when you were hunting for an apple and ignored 
your intuitions first of all. Some of you embraced it by just teleporting 
somewhere or floating.  
 
 
These are all a sense of getting aware of intuition, your body awareness, and 
slowly building up that trust so that your mind takes you where it needs to 
takes you to places you can actually cope with and so on.  
 
 
Does that make sense?  Rest assured things will get a little bit more bizarre. 
Are there any other comments before we move on? 
 
Student: I had a strange experience. I started and I was following the jogging route that 
I used to do, and then as I started the jogging route, it was like I was looking at 
it from a camera, from behind in the third person, but then when I was 
wanting to look at details like watch shops I was passing or something, I kind 
of zoomed on into it and I was looking at it from the first person.  
 
 
 
Then I turned a corner and I actually became still and everything else was 
going past me rather than me going down the street. I’m not sure why those 
three modes happened.

Igor: 
That’s wonderful. You’re actually learning to do some very interesting mental 
phenomena. The ones you’re describing are association and dissociation. Both 
are very useful skills.  
 
 
The third one, which is where you were still and everything was moving 
around you – I guess that’s a new version that psychiatrists haven’t even 
thought of yet. 
 
 
What I find more interesting about that isn’t so much the actual experience 
that you had – although it is an interesting one. Notice how starting with a 
relatively mundane exercise, because you’ve gotten so good at it now, your 
unconscious mind is spontaneously starting to fill in things, unexpected things 
that didn’t happen yesterday. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
How many of you are beginning to notice that stuff’s happening that you 
didn’t really necessarily ask for? It was interesting but unexpected in some 
ways. Put your hands up please. Good, because that’s where we’re going to 
go today. 
 
 
One of the main features that we want to focus on today is having 
unexpected experiences start to occur. Why do you think that might be? It’s 
because it’s unconscious. If it’s unexpected, it means there is no conscious 
filtration. That means you’ve got to write down the material that you’re 
actually looking for.  
 
 
Now we don’t know what to do with that material yet, so we’re going to work 
towards that slowly, but actually reaching it is the important part. That’s the 
key to this whole method. Do you get the idea? 
 
Mindful Mentalization 
 
Igor: 
Before we go down that route, I’d like you to have another couple of 
experiences now. Overall would it be fair to say that whilst your ability to 
mentalize has improved since before you came to the course, this morning 
was a little less vivid, a little harder than yesterday for most of you?  
 
 
For some of you it was just very easy to do. It became almost a no brainer to 
you, right? The no brainer guys basically have the skills already, so just 
increase the challenge a little bit. For the rest of you, you’re in the right place. 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
182 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Let’s now contrast that to doing something else. What I’d like you to do now 
is once again move through a neighborhood. We’re going to use this as a 
check of experiences, but before you do that I want you to do your mindful 
counting – breathing and counting, five breaths, 10 breaths or whatever is 
comfortable to you. 
 
 
Once you’ve done your mindful counting, do your little tour of the 
neighborhood. At the end of it, I want you to do an integration breathing. In 
other words, go back to the breathing in some respect, but don’t try to do 
anything with it. 
 
 
Do you remember how yesterday we did the mindful counting and at the end 
of it you just hung out with your breathing without trying to do anything in 
particular?  
 
 
So, you’re going to start with the breath count, do the actual mentalization 
and then end with a kind of a freestyle breathing integration. Does that sound 
good to you? Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: This time around I think I’ll take a tour of my childhood neighborhood. There 
were two-story apartment buildings and yellow bricks. So, when we’re 
outside my apartment you would have a playground on the right-hand side 
with some swings and some other stuff. 
 
 
Beyond that there are some hockey goals, and there are actually six two-story 
apartment buildings in three rows and in between there are rows, so you can 
access all of those. 
 
 
Just around my building in that gap between the two buildings, there are a lot 
of bushes and a paved road up to a graveyard actually. Interesting, I haven’t 
thought about that. Actually my window when I grew up faced a graveyard. 
 
 
So, we could take that tour I guess. If we just go around my building where I 
grew up, you would have two maple trees on the left-hand side and then the 
graveyard and a soccer field. I think I’m satisfied with that for the moment.

Igor: 
Was that a little bit different to the previous version of the same exercise? 
How was it different?  
 
Student: I benefitted from our colleague that had this speed sensation. I decided to try 
it, so when I came out of my apartment in Germany – many years ago there 
was a comic strip character called The Flash and it just flashed past me and 
then I was at one point, but then I found that everything that I’d flash past 
was coming back to me. 
 
 
So, it was as though I was faster than that and it was just following me. Then I 
did that over four or five different places and it continued to do that. For me, 
it was almost as though when I got to the point of counting the breathing and 
the free flow afterwards, I was aware of different conversations. 
 
 
Now I have a problem with my hearing from working in industry a lot but I 
could hear them clearly as though they were pinpointed coming out of 
nowhere – here, there and there – and it was strange, but then I came out of 
it a long time before everybody else did. I thought that’s it, I’ve done it, I feel 
okay and I came out of it. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: That’s what happened for me. 
 
Igor: 
Remember the signal-to-noise ratio we talked about yesterday? That’s 
probably why your hearing is improving. Have you changed your actual ear? 
Probably not.  
 
 
I don’t think you can actually change your inner ear in that way, but what you 
can do is change which parts of the message is coming from where your brain 
pays attention to and which part it ignores. So, you can create the 
hallucination or the illusion of better hearing, which really is better hearing. 
Isn’t that interesting? 
 
Student: I have a question if I’m communicating with myself correctly. I went to a place 
where I stayed in Germany for like one and a half years and it was quite a long 
time ago. I could remember some of the neighborhood but not everything, 
like it didn’t come, so I just let it be and moved to different areas but there 
were places where it was very hazy. So, was it correct to try to persist and to 
just let it be there and then wait?

Flight Club 
 
Igor: 
I’m glad this came up. Remember I promised you the seven rules of Flight 
Club? Well, here’s the first one of them. All of you are doing it, so we may as 
well start to talk about it. 
 
 
The first rule of Flight Club is: 
 
1. Discover, don’t create. 
 
 
What the difference between discovering and creating?  
 
Student: I think it’s already there. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Think about your mindset. If you’re creating it, then you’re 
consciously choosing it, and there are times when that’s of course useful. 
When you’re discovering, you’re letting your unconscious mind do the work 
for you. 
 
 
So, not only is it easier but, importantly, you’re showing trust in an 
unconscious process. Also the things you discovery tend to be more 
meaningful or important to you. It’s all the stuff that you’ve not been paying 
attention to in the first place, so when it comes out that’s where the payoff 
tends to be. 
 
 
There are a couple of corollaries to this idea of discovery, to answer your 
question here. What do you do if a portion of your experience isn’t the way 
you want it to be? You have two choices: 
 
1. You can leave. 
 
 
In other words, if it’s too much for you for some reason, you can always leave 
and that’s a skill that we’ll be developing tomorrow. On the other hand, the 
choice is: 
 
2. Just sit with it. 
 
 
Notice I’m not trying to do anything with it. For example, if there’s a hazy 
area, if you try to fill in the blanks consciously all you’re going to do is start 
creating something, and it won’t necessarily be what you need it to be.

If you just hang out there and are okay with it being hazy, just sit there – you 
don’t try to make it more hazy and you don’t try to change it – then what is 
that saying in terms of your relationship with your unconscious?  
 
 
Let me give you a scenario. Let’s say you’re tutoring a little child in math – a 
lot of kids have math phobias nowadays – and you ask them what’s two plus 
two, and the little kid just turns almost to tears and says I don’t know, I don’t 
know, what is a more useful approach?  
 
 
Come on, think, think. You can do it, think. It’s four. What we just did there or 
say it’s okay, I know you don’t know yet. Take your time. Relax.  
 
 
Which of the two approaches is more likely to be useful for the relationship – 
not necessarily with the math skills but just for the relationship you have with 
that child? The second one, right?  
 
 
Are you beginning to understand the idea behind just sitting with something? 
This is very easy. This comes onto the fifth rule, which we’ll talk about now, so 
we’re going to jump around a little bit. 
 
 The fifth rule of Flight Club is the equanimity rule. 
 
 
In other words, whenever you have an emotion, sit with it. If it’s a good 
emotion, sit with it, enjoy it and appreciate it. If it’s a bad emotion, sit with it, 
appreciate it and let it be the way it is.  
 
 
This takes us back to one of the other sayings or the rules we talked about 
yesterday: 
 
 What you resist will persist and what you accept you gain the power 
to transform. 
 
 
Now you’re getting to that point where you’re beginning to sense the 
boundary area between the conscious and the unconscious. You’re beginning 
to sense the veil in terms of some things are hazy, or something’s going on, or 
I had an intuition or this came up but it wasn’t good enough. 
 
 
Are you beginning to get a sense where that boundary is starting to lie for 
you? Of course it will change on a daily basis depending on your mood and so 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

on, but over a period of time you should be getting better and better at 
sensing that boundary and better and better at moving that boundary 
backwards just by the nature of the relationship you’re having. 
 
 
Let me ask you this. If you had a friend and that friend can never be angry, 
upset or depressed around you, do you really have a friendship or is it an 
acquaintance? When it comes to your own mind, would you like to have a 
friendship or an acquaintance? Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
 
By the way, the equanimity rule is one of the most healing portions of the 
Buddhist meditation practices. This, alone, in terms of the mindfulness 
practice that has been researched has had huge healing effects on people 
over a period of time, so it’s very well worth doing. Tomorrow we’ll really look 
at the equanimity practice in a much bigger way, but for the moment just 
follow the general rule. 
 
 Discover, don’t create. 
 
 If it’s not what you want or it is what you want, just sit with it and 
appreciate it. 
 
 
This takes us to another version of the Law of Attention. Remember we talked 
yesterday about attention is the currency of the mind? The Law of Attention 
is basically where attention goes energy flows. A lot of you may be familiar 
with that already.  
 
 
The idea is that whatever you focus on, you tend to get more of. What do very 
angry people focus on? All the happy moments in their life? What do people 
who are happy focus on? Everything they’ve messed up in their life? No. 
 
 
So, wherever you put your attention, your psychological energy goes and 
more of that tends to come back. On a purely psychological level, this is 
expressed as the ideodynamic response, in the physical sense the ideomotor 
response and so on. You’re welcome to go and read up on that if you’re 
interested in that area. 
 
 
However, there is a corollary to the Law of Attention that isn’t talked about 
much, and that is the quality of attention you put on something. We all know 
that children crave attention. Can we take that as a given?  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

I don’t know if you’re aware of this but if a child can’t get positive attention 
like love and affection, they crave attention so much that they’ll take negative 
attention too. Have you ever seen a child acting out? 
 
 
The quality of attention will change the nature of an experience. Let’s say two 
different people have the same experience. Let’s say they’re walking down 
the street and a bird poops on their shoulder. It’s not necessarily an 
experience you’d choose for yourself.  
 
 
The first person gets upset and feels embarrassed. The second person laughs 
and moves on. Now the day passes and they’re in company and someone 
brings up this event from the other day. The first person gets embarrassed all 
over again. The second person laughs out loud and says yes that was funny, 
wasn’t it? 
 
 
This continues over a period of years. Eventually the first person has a bird 
phobia. They become so afraid of being embarrassed because they’re adding 
more embarrassment. All those emotions are kind of surrounding the original 
memory and every time they think of it, the emotion intensifies.  
 
 
Now whether that emotion is positive or negative is irrelevant. It just 
intensifies. So, if you think about those areas in your life where you have been 
stuck and can’t move on from, at least one of the things that’s going on there 
is that every time you think about it, what is the quality of your attention? Is it 
overall positive or negative? I can guarantee it will be negative.  
 
 
Now think of those areas in your life that used to be a problem but aren’t 
anymore. At some point in your life didn’t you learn to change the quality of 
your attention? Some people call it laughing at themselves or shrugging it off 
or being kind to themselves or understand themselves. 
 
 
You have lots of different labels for this. The quality of the attention you give 
something will change its nature, especially when it comes to your internal 
self; hence the equanimity rule. We’ll play with that a little bit further.  
 
 
If you’re confronted with something hard to deal with, a tough psychological 
symbol and you reject it, you beat yourself up about it, you blame it, you’re 
angry about it and so on, what quality of attention are you putting on it? 
What’s the shell that’s going to be going around it? What kind of pearl are you 
going to be developing from this little seed?

If on the other hand your attention is overall benign, what’s likely to happen 
then? How many hypnotherapists are in the room? If you think about the 
work that you do, in some respects can you not simplify it to the point where 
you get them to be able to look at or think about a difficult situation or 
context whilst feeling or having a different kind of attention or attitude 
towards it than they used to have? Wouldn’t that be a simple definition of the 
therapeutic process? 
 
 
So if you’re going to do self-therapy, equanimity is one of the simplest ways of 
doing that to slowly start eroding whatever happens around a problem. When 
we come to the idea of a scenery that’s a little bit vague, if you get upset with 
yourself what do you think is likely to happen? Are you likely to have better 
scenery next time or worse? 
 
 
If on the other hand you can just be okay with it and say that’s fine, is it likely 
that it’s going to resolve into something clearer over time or at least more 
likely than if you beat yourself up about it? Do you get the idea? 
 
 
These are the two basic rules we’re going to start with.  
 
 Discover, don’t create. 
 The equanimity rule. 
 
 
The third rule we’re going to explore in a slightly new way, if that’s okay with 
you. Let me ask you this. In the tour of your neighborhood, how many of you 
went through basically a landscape where just you exist, there are no people 
at all? Very good.  
 
 
Of course if you actually were to walk through your neighborhood in real life, 
you’d probably see one or two people at least or maybe a couple of cars or 
something like that. Would that be fair to say? So, you’ve done the exercise 
but it’s not entirely true to life yet.  
 
 
How many of you saw actual people walking around, doing their thing, 
shopping or whatever? Good.

Generating Interactions 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do now is we’re going to do the same exercise again.  
 
 
We’re going to start with the mindful count. By all means challenge yourself 
to pick up the count a little bit. If it’s getting very easy to count to at the point 
you’re doing right now, add a couple of numbers. Go to the point just before 
it starts getting tricky for you. 
 
 
Then as you do a tour of whatever neighborhood you choose, all I want you to 
do is start spotting people. Actually to make it even easier for you, spot 
anything that is in motion. When you spot it, hang out with it. Sit with it. Try 
to interact with it. 
 
 
Don’t force it. Just be very aware of it. I understand my instructions are 
currently a bit vague, but that’s because I don’t want to put my fish in your 
dream too much. I’d rather talk about your experience once it’s happened, 
and then we can discuss a little bit more about how to use that. 
 
 
Then of course at the end of the process, go back to your integration 
breathing, that general breathing without much effort, and in due course we’ll 
talk about what the value of that is at the end. 
 
 
Do you have any questions about the exercise despite its vagueness? Again, 
either with your partners or on your own – whichever you prefer – start with 
the breath count. Just add one or two to it if you can.  
 
 
Then walk through whatever neighborhood you wish and, importantly, spot 
motion of some sort and when you do, become more aware of it, hang out 
with it or try to interact with it but don’t force any interaction. Just see 
whatever happens.  
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, we’re in front of my childhood home again. We take a right and on the 
left-hand side there’s a playground, some swings. I think we’ll go back the way 
we took the last time. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

So, we take a right at the corner of that building and pass through the paved 
road in between the bushes that leads up to the graveyard. When we take a 
right at the next corner, we’ll see the maple trees and the soccer field.  
 
 
There is some kind of movement on the soccer field. I can’t really say what it 
is but there is some kind of movement. So, the building is on our right-hand 
side at the moment. 
 
Igor: 
Let me pause you there for a second. The movement, you can’t quite make 
out? Go ahead and go back to it and just sit with it for a while. Don’t try to do 
anything.  
 
 
Just be aware of it. Be curious or whatever you want to be but just sit with 
that for a while. Once you’ve done that for a little while, carry on your way 
but just give it a moment. 
 
Student: So, still the soccer field to the left and the building to the right. Now we pass 
the apartment I grew up in on the right-hand side because it’s facing both 
ways, both the graveyard and soccer field and the other side – the entrance 
and the window to my room as well. There might actually be some movement 
in that window as well but it’s all very unclear. 
 
 
It’s all very unclear in the way that it’s more movement of colors, nothing 
distinct, no characteristics. It’s red, white and blue. There is something 
unpleasant with it but not entirely. There’s something good with it as well. 
 
Igor: 
Once again, seeing it’s an unusual thing like that, just sit with that. Don’t try to 
make sense of it. Just sit with it for a while and then bring yourself back. 
 
 
Okay, welcome back. How was that? Was that interesting? Talk me through 
that. What did you notice? What have you learned so far?  
 
Student: What I noticed this time because I chose for the second time to take a tour of 
a childhood neighborhood is that my mind kept slipping into transderivational 
search mode.  
 
 
So, if I found myself in the playground in this one particular school that I went 
to in the country, then all of the sudden I’d be in the city remembering that 
playground or even events that happened where I had certain mindsets.

For example, I remember I was on a highway riding my bike and all the gears 
broke and I got so mad I threw it in the ditch, but then as I was just getting 
close to work – I’m 14 years old – a gang of bikers decides to stop and hassle 
me. 
 
 
So, it’s the kind of situation where you get a feeling that maybe this could be 
good or bad, but to be alert – which then my mind went to a time in Tijuana 
when I got stopped at 1:00 o’clock in the morning. To be alert could be bad. It 
kept looping on those searches. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s pause and have a little chat about what’s going on there. The first thing 
you did there is you discovered what’s called the affect bridge. Affect is a less 
used term for basically emotion.  
 
 
One of the ways our memories are coded is through emotion, through states 
of being. So, you basically traced memories according to different states of 
being. The exercises we’ve done up to this point have been using a different 
kind of bridge. We’ve linked a different kind of emotions linked spatially. 
 
 
The tour of the neighborhood is to give you stability by moving through a 
stable physical environment, so you’re using your spatial locator shall we say 
to help stabilize it.  
 
 
The reason we’re bouncing around so much is because now we’re starting 
introducing the idea of emotions, and your emotions started hijacking your 
memories and you’re following the affect bridge, which is not a bad thing by 
the way. It’s a very useful thing. It’s a good discovery to have.  
 
 
If you want to remove yourself from the affect bridge – in other words you 
don’t want to keep bouncing around from one memory to another memory 
and another memory; in other words, you want your environment to be 
stable again – then you just need to be aware of it. I’m not following the 
emotional track rather than the spatial track.  
 
 
Remember the spatial track, because of the way we’ve all grown up, is more 
stable. Our emotions are constantly changing, so we’re naturally bouncing 
around.

All you need to do is whenever you have a memory and you decide I don’t 
want to be bouncing around anymore then just add the next rule. If you wish 
to do it, you can try it right now if you want. It’s up to you. Move. 
 
Student: Physically move? 
 
Igor: 
You can do physically moving as well if it helps you. That’s one of the ways we 
stabilized yesterday, but I mean move inside of the memory. Move inside of 
the location.  
 
 
It doesn’t matter if it was actually what happened in the memory itself, but 
put yourself back there riding your bike, your brakes, you’re angry and so on 
and the bikers are coming.  
 
 
Try the following if you want to do this as an experiment. Can you put yourself 
there? Now instead of following the emotion, move. The place to move of 
course is the place you don’t want to move, which is just walk towards the 
bikers and just hang out there for a moment. Just with that. What happened 
there? 
 
Student: It’s okay. 
 
Igor: 
It’s okay. Do you want to play a little bit more just because it could be a useful 
thing? There are the bikers? Close your eyes. Now realize there’s a memory 
and then there’s a symbol. Of course this is now getting into more symbolic 
territory. You’re now okay just standing there and they’re standing there. Are 
they doing anything? 
 
Student: They’re concerned. 
 
Igor: 
They’re concerned. Just pause and just sit with that for a moment. Now try to 
interact with them in some way, maybe it’s a pleasant hello. Now I take it 
from your smile that something just happened there. 
 
Student: No, it was okay. 
 
Igor: 
It was okay. So, an emotion came up, right? Just sit with that emotion. Just let 
it be.

Student: I’m sorry. Just to comment, again I’m bouncing around from biker to military 
in Tijuana.  
 
Igor: 
So, go back. This is great. It’s just your mind destabilizing because you’re used 
to following the affect bridge. So, go right back to the bikers again and as soon 
as you find yourself trying to bounce somewhere else, go back and put 
emotion in.  
 
 
Walk around the other side. Walk to the left. Walk to the right. Maybe touch 
one of the bikers on the shoulder and notice what happens then. Does that 
stabilize the image? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, this is very important. This is giving you control of your internal 
environment. How many times are you plagued by memories you do not want 
to have? How many times are you trying to think of something but you keep 
being disrupted by another thought? 
 
 
Creating this kind of mental stability is actually very important, and this is a 
really nice metaphor that’s going to teach you how to do that. It’s not the only 
way to do it but it’s one of the easiest ways.  
 
 
The other thing I want to point out is notice how you went from a position 
where at first it was dangerous but you were okay with it, and then there was 
this idea of concern, and actually then the emotion kind of polarized to 
something a little bit more positive. 
 
 
Let’s put this aside as a memory and look at this as just a symbolic transaction 
with your unconscious. What do you think has just happened, even though it’s 
just to a very small degree?  
 
 
Could we call this a small amount of healing? You’ve been carrying around a 
little bit of fear, and now that little fear has turned around into a little bit of 
care perhaps. I don’t know what label you put onto it. Do you see where I’m 
going with this? 
 
 
Now is this going to change and transform your life? Not necessarily but we’re 
still doing training wheels. We’re still trying to figure out how do we interact 
with our own internal environment instead of going to our default position – 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
194 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
which is the affect bridge that you’re very familiar with? Is this making sense 
to you? 
 
 
Again, let me emphasize there is nothing wrong with following the affect 
bridge provided you’re doing it for a purpose and if it’s doing it for you, if it’s 
part of your purpose – which is show me what I need to see – then you’ll jump 
around and you’ll see those things, but if it’s more a question of I need to 
complete some interaction, you can say thank you for that, let’s get back to 
the bikers and then you move and that stabilizes you within that environment 
– and it did, did it not? 
 
 
So, do you want to say anything about your experience on that side? 
 
Student: When I again bounced back to the situation with the military in Tijuana, again 
I had that sense of relief. 
 
Igor: 
In other words, the thing that you’ve learned in one memory started 
occurring in the next memory as well. This is how we create both problems 
and solutions by the way because memories chain. They chain on the affect 
bridge. Now if you release the affect in one memory, it tends to follow 
through another.  
 
 
Is this useful to you? Are you beginning to learn a few things here? Just 
because it came up, it’s a useful thing, so I appreciate your doing this with me. 
If you want to do some healing with it then you’ve healed one situation, and 
you know because your affect bridge already pulled to other memories like 
the Tijuana moment, and then you can say great, my work’s done here, I feel 
complete, now take me over here. Oh, look it’s happening here as well.  
 
 
Usually what happens is with each iteration the release happens more and 
more quickly. Once you’ve learned to do that on a small scale – which is this – 
then when you start getting into the bigger things, the things that are a big 
deal in your life, you’ll be able to handle them and cope with them. 
 
 
Notice how none of that actually happened until you did something first. You 
made a choice consciously, didn’t you? The choice was I want to stay. I’m 
going to show you I want to stay by engaging with my environment.  
 
 
This is the next rule. They’re all interlinked in some way.

 Interacting with it. 
 
 
A simple way to interact with something is to move. I’m interacting with a 
landscape by moving through it, by touching it. How do you interact with 
people? By touching them, by speaking to them – sometimes mentally and 
sometimes physically – but this is how we interact with people. 
 
 
Do you get where I’m going with this? These are all rules that are going to 
help you not only stabilize your internal environment but do something 
healthy with it as well. So, you’re learning about yourself and growing at the 
same time. Does that make sense to you? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I had a similar experience. I had two experiences. In one experience I went 
back to this place in Germany and to stabilize I thought I’d go into the house, 
and I was expecting some emotion there.  
 
 
I saw myself as a little kid, smaller than I was when I was there. I was very 
small, so I took myself by the arm and it started to vanish, like it started to 
dissolve, and like the head fell off and turned into a ball and it went all crazy. 
The ball went out. It was huge and I was hazy suddenly, and then I was like on 
a lawn. There were cows and suddenly I was going down on a boat 
somewhere.  
 
 
It was like crazy stuff. I just went with it but I didn’t know – am I supposed to 
do something with this, or should I go back to trying to explore my 
neighborhood? 
 
Igor: 
Are you beginning to get a sense that we’re getting into a little bit more 
unconscious territory than we explored yesterday? Before you came to the 
seminar, most of you had problems visualizing and then yesterday that just 
went away. Would that be a fair thing to say? 
 
 
But today we’re going to a different point. Now we’re starting to interact with 
the unconscious mind more, trying to learn from it and grow with it. In the 
same way as you had instability – which made visualizations hard at first and 
then you made them easier – so in the same way interacting with your 
unconscious mind is going to destabilize things to a certain extent, but as you 
learn how to work with that it will become more stable again.

Of course one way to work with it is to just follow the imagery and see what 
symbolic things come out. It doesn’t do much for stability but it does a lot for 
train of associations shall we say.  
 
 
Just like with Edie next to you, if you want stability added into that, then you 
just add emotion. So, go back to the idea of the baby dissolving in your arms. 
Can you kind of recapture that moment? All you need to do is as that’s 
occurring, just take a step and then just sit with it. Be curious about it. Then 
take another step in the same environment. Take another step.  
 
 
Maybe look around but let whatever is occurring in terms of that child 
dissolving, let it occur in any way that it wants – whether it dissolves or 
solidifies, it doesn’t really matter. Just hang out there and take another step. 
Tell me what’s happening now as you’re doing all that? 
 
Student: The environment still changed, like the baby dissolved and it was like this ball 
and I took a step. So, I stayed in the imagery. The ball didn’t move away. It’s 
right in front of me but the environment changed and now I’m more stellar 
like feeling and imagery and before it was like my flat where I lived there. 
 
Igor: 
Overall is it feeling more stable or less stable than the first time you did it? 
 
Student: It’s definitely more stable.  
 
Igor: 
And that’s the thing we’re looking for. Remember, the key here is stability. 
There will be times when your unconscious mind takes over and says no, you 
need to see this or you need to go here but as long as you have stability, 
that’s your interface.  
 
 
If your computer screen was constantly changing configuration, it would be 
very difficult to know what’s going on. You don’t want it to be static because 
that’s called a picture. You need it to be able to change, so how do you 
change it in a stable way?  
 
 
That’s the key that we’re trying to figure out here, and that’s the one we’ll be 
working on for most of the day today. Has this been useful to you so far? It’s a 
little harder to talk about these things now because we don’t have the 
vocabulary for it, and the more we go towards unconscious territory the less 
our vocabulary will suit us.

So, we’re going to rely more and more on your experiences to be able to draw 
these lessons out, if that’s okay with you. 
 
Student: As soon as I came out to the neighborhood there was a car traveling down, so 
I started following the car. At first I was flying and then I didn’t feel 
comfortable, so I was on a skateboard holding onto the car. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, good. 
 
Student: But it took me way beyond the part of the neighborhood I was aware of, and 
then at one point the people got out of the car and they needed to confront 
me about… 
 
Igor: 
Hanging onto the car, right? Let me ask you this. This is important. What did 
you do at that point? 
 
Student: I sort of stood my ground and then tried to talk them down from it, but then 
at that moment they… 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you here for a moment? Do you mind if we try something? 
Can you recapture that moment when they come out and start telling you off 
or whatever it is? Can you get back to that moment? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. What I want you to do now is as they’re doing that – let them be 
angry, let them do whatever they do – just sit with it as benignly as you can – 
in other words curiously or kindly or compassionately, whatever is easiest for 
you to generate in terms of the benign version of attention. Just hang out 
there benignly like that. What happens? 
 
Student: I feel a lot more comfortable. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Once again, we’re getting to a very tricky stage here. You see, the 
problem we have is we take our inner landscapes too seriously sometimes. 
We think they are real. Remember, if perception is projection then we take 
the outer world too seriously as well and we think it’s real. 
 
 
Now I’m as guilty of it as you are. If something happens that upsets me, I’m 
sitting there and I think it’s very real and I get really upset, and I’ll get angry

and I’ll go home and I’ll say I know better than that. But notice what happens 
as soon as you change the quality of your attention. 
 
 
Over here we had it about stability but here we had it about the quality of 
attention, and it changed the nature of the experience for you, didn’t it? 
Something that was mildly unpleasant has now become mildly pleasant, 
hasn’t it? 
 
 
Rather than locking into our old patterns which create unpleasantness, we 
now get to choose, we now get to train our minds to find new patterns, new 
ways of interacting with things that are more pleasant, and the starting point 
is sitting with it, the non-judgment thing, the benign attention part. 
 
 
That starts the liberation process. Of course as we progress, we’ll do more 
with that but right now that’s the key thing. Instead of resisting – which is 
standing my ground, you’re wrong, I’m right – you’re accepting and benign 
attention helps immensely with that. Does this make sense to you?  
 
Student: It does. What I was going to say is that at that point, spots started appearing 
in my vision and then my vision just sort of tailed out. 
 
Igor: 
Was that just now or earlier on? 
 
Student: At that point earlier on when there was that confrontation. 
 
Igor: 
So, when you had the confrontation, you kind of lost the scene. Whereas now 
when you just sat with it, what happened to the scene then? 
 
Student: It was continued. 
 
Igor: 
Once again this is the point of stability. Remember the apple yesterday? If our 
unconscious mind gives us something – here’s an opportunity to learn 
something, maybe you learn about conflict – and then I say yes I know all 
about conflict, I’m going to fight you – now there’s a sense of resistance and it 
destabilizes a lot of the memory, so it’s actually harder to stay onto it. 
 
 
The alternative thing can happen as well. When I was studying martial arts at 
the university, I was given an exercise by my instructor, which was as you’re 
walking down the street imagine what would happen if someone attacked 
you and how you would deal with it and so on.

I got so good at this exercise that I was having fights all over the place. So, 
then on Guy Fawkes Night, which is like the 4th of July in the U.S., there are 
fireworks everywhere and so on.  
 
 
I’m walking down the street and a fireworks goes off. I’m just talking to some 
friends. I spin around in a full circle. My friend freaks out and runs across the 
road and says what’s wrong with you? You see, I have worked my landscape 
at that point, but what have I done with that landscape? I’ve created one of 
fear and confrontation. 
 
 
Do I want to live my life in fear and confrontation? No, but don’t we do this? 
Those things we have the biggest problems with, don’t we loop around the 
problem solidifying it, making it more, as opposed to learning how to release 
it? 
 
 
You learned to release it. You just learned to release it. You don’t know quite 
what happened yet but at least you stabilized it. Is this useful to you? Are you 
beginning to understand the importance of the rules of Flight Club? 
 
 
They’re teaching you how to interact with your unconscious mind in a way 
that’s going to be healthier for you overall as time goes by. Does that make 
sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I was wondering how do you draw the line or how do you actually find the line 
between flight and just mere dreaming? To give you an example, I might stray 
a little bit. I once had a dream and it was one of those dreams where 
somebody follows you – wild animals or bad people or something like that. 
 
 
I was a big fat Sumo guy and I ran and he ran even faster than me and at that 
moment I realized well that’s impossible. Okay, he might kill you but only in 
your dream. Okay, so I turned and he stopped and I said but why did you 
follow me then? Well, because you ran away. Since that day, I never again had 
a dream like that, but the other possibility would be… 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you before you add the other possibility? Let us imagine that 
instead of dreaming that particular incident, you actually just mentalized it in 
the way that we’ve been doing so far – and we’re actually going to develop 
more.

Would there be any difference in terms of that experience to let’s say his 
experience where instead of fighting the people who came out of the car, he 
just sat with them in a very benign sort of way and then transformed the 
whole situation?  
 
 
Doesn’t that sound very similar? Winfried, instead of starting with saying I had 
a dream where this was happening, if he had told us – and we’ll be getting 
onto the more freestyle exercises soon – that oh I was mentalizing the scene 
and then suddenly this guy was chasing me, so I ran away and then I stopped 
and I asked him why are you chasing me and he said this – doesn’t it sound 
really identical to what you were saying? 
 
 
In that sense is there really a difference between a dream, whether it’s lucid 
or not, and what you’re doing here? We’re working in the same unconscious 
territory in a way, aren’t we? Does that make sense? I know you have a 
follow-up, so please continue with that. 
 
Student: So, this was in a dream and my conscious-unconscious did all the work and 
found the right solution for me. I’m not sure if I could do it while mentalizing 
consciously. I think there would be a tendency either to take it too seriously 
and get caught in the situation or dreaming like I could fly away from this, 
which is not ... 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Really the distinction between a dream and a mentalization is 
irrelevant at this point. It’s more a question of how you respond to more 
problematic situations like that. That’s really the more interesting part, isn’t 
it? 
 
 
We have a couple of rules here. Let’s see if we can work with them. Let’s 
assume your dream was a mentalization instead just to answer the question 
behind the question there. Did you discover things? Would it be fair to say 
you discovered stuff and you didn’t actually create it, right? 
 
 
Did he move within the dream? So, it became more stable, and by the way 
that’s one of the reasons why running away actually gets you chased even 
more because you’re moving in the dream. Did he interact with the sumo 
chasing men? 
 
 
That’s the point of transition, isn’t it? This is interesting. Had he kept on 
running, would he have been interacting? That’s why he kept getting chased.

We haven’t talked about the fourth one yet, so we’ll skip that one for the 
moment.  
 
 Equanimity 
 
 
Did he present the benign attention to the sumo chaser? Note before the 
transformation whilst he was busy running away, flying away, avoiding or 
escaping whatever was happening, he was not being equanimious, was he? 
He wasn’t sitting with it.  
 
 
He wasn’t staying with it because there was something saying get away, and 
instead of staying with the feeling of get away, he was trying to actually act it 
out. In other words, instead of resolving the feeling of being chased by 
something, he’s practicing it. Do you understand what I’m saying here? 
 
 
Even though we haven’t got all our rules sorted out yet, just by following of 
our seven rules he had a transformation so that he was never ever again 
plagued by one of those chasing dreams.  
 
 
If we look back on all the cultures, there are a number of cultures that work 
with dreams. I believe the Shamanic culture – I can’t remember what they’re 
called now, but they have a particular practice where if children have a 
nightmare – for example being chased by monsters is a very common one – 
the instructions are very simple. 
 
 
If a monster is chasing you, you stop, turn around, catch it – which is kind of 
the equanimious and interaction part right there – and demand a gift. Let me 
give you an example of this from some of the people who went through the 
beta group with this one. 
 
 
We’re getting into a process that we’ll come onto this afternoon, so I’ll just 
skip ahead a little bit. One of the guys was swimming in the ocean and a shark 
attacks him.  
 
 
He’s terrified and he feels the fear, by the way – this is one of the reasons 
we’re going to do more mindfulness before we get to the afternoon – and he 
tries to swim away.

I told him to stop, just stay there, sit with it, just let the moment happen and 
let whatever happens happen. If it wants to bite you, let it eat you. If it 
doesn’t, it doesn’t. Let it do whatever it does. 
 
 
So, he just hung out there and the shark stopped dead in its track and then – I 
can’t remember the exact thing but it was something like the fear 
transformed to the feeling of power, and the shark ended up giving him a lift 
and he had a feeling of exhilaration.  
 
 
Now let’s just think about this for a moment. In terms of developing a 
symbolic landscape, let’s take two scenarios. In one scenario the spontaneous 
event occurs, so he’s discovered for sure. He’s frightened and he tries to swim 
away.  
 
 
What’s going to continue? What’s he building there in terms of an emotional 
experience? Fear, right? What’s he creating in terms of intellectual 
understanding? That you run away from fear and you get more fear. So, he’s 
practicing getting more fear in his life in some respects.  
 
 
Now let’s take the other path where he stopped and let the shark do 
whatever it wanted to. Let’s face it. In your mentalization it can’t actually 
physically harm you. The harm that’s being done is actually believe it or not 
when you’re running away. 
 
 
So, what happens when he stops? Whether or not the shark eats him, 
eventually he gets to a point of transformation. What’s he practicing now – 
exhilaration or fear?  
 
 
 
At the end of the two sessions – one where he’s been busy swimming away 
for his life and the other one where’s he’s being exhilarated getting a ride on 
the back of a shark – which one going forward is going to enhance his life 
more? Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
This is why we have the hero’s journey as part of the ASH Process. Do we have 
an archetypal force there in the chasing dream? Yes. In the shark dream – fear 
again, yes. These are common things.  
 
 
Do we have a symbol? Yes – a big sumo wrestler chasing us is symbolic. I’m 
not sure what it’s symbolic of but it is symbolic. The shark is also symbolic. 
The last step is the hero’s journey.

Remember, the hero’s journey is when you get sent into the underworld, you 
face your death, your fear or whatever it is and you come back with a boon, a 
gift, an extra power – in this case exhilaration.  
 
 
Do you see how those three simple ideas expressed within these rules – which 
we haven’t even completed yet – start cleaning up your internal landscape? If 
your internal landscape is free of fear, if your internal landscape is full of 
excitement and exhilaration and happiness and comfort and so on, what do 
you think the chances are of your experience in the outside world being that 
much more benign?  
 
 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re trying to achieve here? Do you 
also have a sense that we’ve just fundamentally made a switch from the kind 
of work we were doing yesterday to the kind of work we’re starting to do 
today.  
 
 
We’re still in the transition period. We haven’t entirely made the switch but 
we’re starting to make that transition. Do you have a sense of that? Thank 
you for that. Is there a follow-up or was that good? 
 
Student: Not at the moment. 
 
Igor: 
Not at the moment. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I’m a bit confused because when we started the exercise, we were going 
while it’s mentalizing going about the neighborhood, and now I see that we’ve 
actually switched from that into discovery. Now if I’m in discovery mode, for 
sure I’ll discover something. Now how real is that because I’m looking for it? 
 
 
So, is that a discovery if that pops out or is it me creating it because I’m 
expecting it? The question is do I keep with the exercise of discovery of going 
around the neighborhood, or do I just use that as a pretext to discover 
something? 
 
Igor: 
It’s a great question. Once again, the reason there’s a confusion there is 
because we don’t have a shared reference experience yet to make it clear 
what the differences are. Let me see if I can use some of the experiences 
you’ve already had to distinguish them.

The nature of the exercise is almost irrelevant. I’ve taken essentially the same 
exercise but I’m starting to shift its direction. In other words, what you’ve 
changed or what you’re starting to change today compared to yesterday is 
you’re beginning to change your intent, your expectation. 
 
 
In doing that of course your unconscious mind dutifully performs by adding 
things in that you wished. Now the subtlety that you need to start learning 
about – and that’s something that’s going to take a little bit of time, hopefully 
you’ll get it today but I cannot guarantee when you’ll get this – the subtlety 
you’re trying to elucidate is when are you forcing something and when is it 
coming to you? 
 
 
Take the example of the Alphabet Game we played yesterday, finding the 
letter A. I want an apple, I haven’t got any apples. What do I look for? Here’s 
the amplifier. He’s looking for an A. He’s not quite aware of the amplifier as 
an A category type thing yet but at some point he makes that realization, so 
he’s succeeded at it.  
 
 
At other times you may say there’s an apple, it’s boring, let’s look for 
something else. So, you now have refused an unconscious act. As long as 
you’re aware that you refused it, then the next time the lesson of course is 
learning to be able to accept it again.  
 
 
It doesn’t matter how long that takes of course. It’s once again learning to 
build the ability to trust that mental process. The exercise on the surface may 
sound identical to yesterday’s, but actually it’s already very different because 
I set a different set of expectations, which means you’ve changed your 
intention going in, in the first place. 
 
 
So, it’s no longer the same exercise. The idea of intention will make a little bit 
more sense as we go onto the next session. We’ll be looking more at 
mindfulness and intention and stuff like that then, and then we’ll build on 
that throughout the day. 
 
 
Maybe to help answer the question behind the question, in terms of what 
should I do in terms of my practice, the question is what are you trying to 
achieve? Do you want to achieve merely a more stable and vivid mental 
platform mentalization? That’s what yesterday was about. That’s the first 
level.

Or do you want to start having interactions with deeper unconscious material, 
even though you don’t necessarily know what to do with them yet? That’s 
what today is about. 
 
 
If you want the former, you stick with the intention and expectations you had 
yesterday. If you want the latter, you start doing more of the things we’ve 
been doing today.  
 
 
This afternoon I’ll give you clearer exercises that will distinguish what we did 
yesterday from what you’ll be doing today, but we’re in that transition phase 
right now, so it’s easier to transition from what you know and go straight to 
what you don’t know. 
 
Student: So, to make a reference to Star Trek, that would be the holodeck.  
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: Okay, good. So, once you discover something, the move part is to stabilize. Or 
is it the third stage basically in the exercise, as I said? 
 
Igor: 
What do you mean by third stage? 
 
Student: The first time you establish the holodeck, the second time you discover 
something and the third step is moving, so you kind of desensitize that, if you 
will. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. The seven rules of Flight Club just allow you to engage with unconscious 
material safely and in a way that’s going to be overall healthy in your life. So, 
what does the movement do? The movement helps you stabilize the 
unconscious portion of that experience. 
 
 
You already know how to stabilize the memory parts because that’s how your 
memory works, so that was the easy part from yesterday. Do you need 
movement in that? Not necessarily but again movement will help equally 
there. 
 
 
The more you get towards unconscious stuff, the more amorphous it is, the 
more shapeless it is and the more changeable it is. It’s kind of like a fever 
dream where this happens, this happens and nothing quite makes sense.

That’s not very useful to you to learn from, so if you have something that 
makes sense and you can learn from it and grow from it, you need to 
constrain all that into something more practical and more useful; hence the 
stability, and movement is one way to do that but actually all seven rules will 
help you do that. It’s just we haven’t uncovered them all. 
 
Student: One last thing. Would you say it’s safe to consider this as a method to deal 
with your own abreactions?  
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
We’ll come onto more of that today and especially tomorrow, but these are 
training wheels. I can’t throw you into what we’re doing tomorrow because 
otherwise you’ll just have the abreaction. 
 
Student: So, by reaching a situation, a sensitizing event – if we talk about that – moving 
around it would actually desensitize it and give you a different point… 
 
Igor: 
Don’t worry about the practical aspects yet because now you’re getting stuck 
on a technique – in other words I’ll clean up this memory this way. What 
you’ll be able to do will be so much more than that. 
 
 
What you’re saying is absolutely correct, only don’t commit to that idea just 
yet because by the end of tomorrow you’ll have a very different idea of the 
whole thing. Okay? Thank you very much. 
 
Student: My scene was in Mexico. Some men from the jungle had come down with a 
wild cat that they wanted to sell on the beach. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Wonderful. 
 
Student: I love cats. I love animals. I was very attracted to it. It was very wild and I was 
also really distressed about the cat and angry with the man. So, I sat with it 
but I realize now I had an intention for something to happen, to get rid of the 
bad feelings. Then I got a crashing headache, which is gone now but I’m very 
dizzy. I feel very dizzy.

Igor: 
Has anyone ever woken up from a bad dream and it’s kind of bad? I 
remember as a teenager I woke up from a really bad dream about my brother 
doing something really nasty to me. I woke up and I was so upset with him but 
I couldn’t say anything to him because it would sound ridiculous saying you 
really annoyed me in the dream when you did this. He’d say what the hell is 
wrong with you? But I felt really upset the whole day. I was fuming. Have I 
learned anything from that experience? Not in the moment, right? 
 
 
That’s kind of what you experienced there. This is why we’re starting to load 
the way we’re loading today. Really it will make more sense tomorrow, I 
promise you. We’re in a bit of an ambiguous stage today. 
 
 
What you’re learning is not to take your symbolic landscape as seriously as 
you’ve done in the past. You do take it seriously – this is important – but it’s 
not important in the way that you think it is. By taking it the wrong way – 
literally almost – then you’re left with a headache, some of the 
unpleasantness and all the rest of it. 
 
 
 
Really you’re using your microcosm, your internal landscape to learn how to 
work out those problems that you can’t work out, out there. When you work 
them out in here safely, when they occur out there you’ll say oh, that’s okay, I 
know how to deal with this. Does that make sense to you? 
 
 
Let’s take your example of the wild cat. Do the men in her symbolic landscape 
really exist? No. Men like that exist, it’s true. But those particular individuals 
do not exist except inside her mind, so when she’s really angry at them, who 
is she really angry at?  
 
Student: Herself. 
 
Igor: 
Where is that anger going? 
 
Student: Back into self. 
 
Igor: 
Right. This is where it gets really trippy. Whenever you’re angry at someone, 
especially if they’re not physically present, who are you really angry at? 
Where is that anger directed towards? 
 
Student: Yourself.

Igor: 
But it’s so tempting to get angry anyway because you’re right, you’re justified. 
It doesn’t make your life any better. Do you see where I’m going with this? It 
is again a subtlety that most people don’t ever get.  
 
 
They’re so wrapped up in their emotions and they’re so wrapped up in 
treating a symbol as something real that they create a massive amount of 
pain for themselves and live a very painful life.  
 
 
If you want to live a pain-free life then you have to stop treating these things 
as seriously, and it’s not always easy. Your mind will test you. Right now we’re 
going to go through some simple exercises, which will be easy to master.  
 
 
So, whether you’re running away from a sumo wrestler or having an 
altercation with some drivers, it’s relatively easy to kind of get the 
transformation from that moment, but once you understand the mechanics of 
it you get bigger and bigger moments, and you’ll know it’s working when you 
meet someone in real life who would normally upset the hell out of you and 
you say I’m actually okay with this, and the other person is totally confused. 
 
 
Let me tell you an amusing story of this that I heard once at a seminar. 
Whether or not it’s true, I don’t know and I’m not going to recommend this as 
an actual course of action, but I think you’ll understand the symbolic nature of 
this experience in terms of what you’ve just been doing here. 
 
 
I think he was working at customer service or something like that at a big 
department store, and a guy comes in and he’s furious and he’s just tearing 
everyone apart. So, he’s been brought in as the manager and he comes out. 
The guy’s ready getting his guns out and his sabers up to start cutting and all 
the rest of it. 
 
 
He recognizes the anger in him, so he leans over and kisses him on the 
forehead. The guy’s like what? So, what happened? The guy’s totally 
nonplussed, totally lost. He just explains very calmly what happened, they 
resolve it and he goes away. 
 
 
You’ll understand what I mean when I say I don’t necessarily recommend this 
as a strategy but if you think about it, once you’ve cleaned up your internal 
landscape, if you think about the benign attention you presented to the angry 
person, it made the situation easier to resolve. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

It won’t always resolve out there because they’re carrying their own 
landscapes, but if you jump into their dream with them and you help them 
continue the fight, then both of you are now in the same dream. If you don’t 
join that dream whilst knowing how quickly they can be stabilized, many 
people will suddenly lose their thread. 
 
 
Can I give you another example of this? My brother is driving and he’s not 
paying attention, and he basically bumps into the car in front of him. It was a 
traffic light stop and he bumps into the car in front of him. It’s not a serious 
bump but it’s enough for the other person to get out of their car unhappy. 
 
 
The lady who comes out of this car is more than unhappy. I mean she’s 
furious and she’s obviously had a very bad day. So, my brother gets out, spots 
some kids in the back seat, looks at her and says oh my God, are your children 
okay? She stops in her tracks, looks and says yes thank you. They exchange 
details, no problem there. 
 
 
Are you beginning to see how daily interactions are not dissimilar to our 
symbolic interactions, but if you can’t cope with them in the outside world it’s 
probably because you can’t cope with them in your inside world either.  
 
 
So, why not start inside yourself where it’s easy to transform and you have 
some rules where you can start with really small things and build up from 
them before you start facing the big things out there? Do you see where 
we’re going with this? 
 
 
I know there are lots more questions and comments and it’s been very useful 
hopefully, but I would like to take a break now because otherwise you guys 
will blow a fuse. Let’s be back in 15 minutes.

DVD 6 – How To Dial Up Your Experiences & 
The Power Of “Benign Attention” 
 
 
Igor: 
How’s everyone doing? In the last session we did a series of exercises, which 
on the surface sounded pretty similar to what we did yesterday, and yet 
somehow something of it changed and consciously it might not be quite that 
easy to put your finger on what it was but significantly different things started 
happening, and you can tell from the nature of the discussion that we had. 
Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
I realize not all of you went down that path. We’re just starting shift directions 
a little bit. You also noticed how not all the experiences that were coming out 
were 100% positive either. Would that be fair to say also? 
 
 
 
That’s because in the unconscious mind you have both Heaven and Hell. You 
have all the good things and all the bad things that you haven’t dealt with yet. 
These rules – although we haven’t got through all of them yet – will help you 
to start navigating through that inner landscape in a way that’s going to be 
benign, like an inner gardener that allows you to nurture the plants and pull 
out the weeds, but of course you have to recognize which one is which.  
 
 
 
That’s part of the experiences that we’re trying to build up here. Because of 
the potential for unpleasant things to come, in other words the unconscious 
mind is going to start using opportunities to say oh you haven’t dealt with this 
for a while; here, go for it. We really need to make sure that we have a mental 
practice or a mental muscle built up that’s going to help us do that. 
 
 
In particular that fifth point – equanimity – you can see the value of it, can 
you not? Can everyone see the value of that? The question though is how do 
you practice equanimity when all Hell’s breaking loose? Of course the answer 
is you do it when Hell isn’t breaking loose. 
 
 
When you’re good at it, then you let the minor Hell come out and you slowly 
start challenging yourself with bigger experiences. Do you get the idea? Really 
the muscle that allows you to remain calm, remain equanimious, is the

So, I’d like you to go back to some of the mindfulness training we did 
yesterday and see if we can build some extra things that we’ve been talking 
about today into it. Is that okay with you? 
 
 
Let’s start off with just the classic mindful count, followed by the mindful 
breathing or the integration breathing. Remember those two? Whatever 
number you had yesterday, I would like for you to just go beyond that. If it’s 
just one or two that’s just fine. Just go beyond that. 
 
 
If you get to the point where it starts getting difficult, you can just pause there 
and the next time you’ll know your count is one or two numbers less than 
that. Does that make sense?  
 
 
See if you can stretch yourself to go to the point where you start losing it a 
little bit and your focus kind of departs a little bit or starts feeling a little hard 
and so on.  
 
 
That will tell you this is my new ceiling, step back one or two numbers from 
that and that will be your new number to work with for the rest of today, 
unless of course you decide to go even further. Does that make sense to you? 
 
 
Let’s start off with that for now. Please settle down, eyes closed, on your own 
and practice the mindful count followed by mindful breathing. When you’re 
done, please open your eyes so that I know that we can continue as a group 
again. 
 
Benign Attention 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do now is see what we can do with this idea of benign 
attention, seeing as we’ve talked about it so much and you’ve had some 
rough experiences here, from fighting with your inner dream world to 
benignly attending it and it transformed, from running away from a sumo 
wrestler and benignly attending it and being transformed, from being wary of 
the bikers to them actually being concerned and so on. 
 
 
Do you get the idea of where I’m going with this? For those of you who are 
less familiar with the English language, benign is an unusual term for many 
people. Benign just means overall positive.

You can use things like kindness, curiosity, interest, anything that has a 
generally positive overtone as opposed to the opposite – the maligned 
attention would be rejecting, disgust, dislike.  
 
 
So, there is a very mild kind of judgment going on in the background but it’s 
overall kind of like yes this is good, let it be, this is the way things should be 
and so on. Do you get the idea?  
 
 
I’d like you to practice it now by doing the mindful count again, only this time 
your metacognition is tracking two things. One is of course the count that 
you’re counting, and the second thing is how benign is your attention on your 
object of attention – in this case your breathing? 
 
 
If there’s a little bit of frustration there, it’s not benign but you can be 
benignly aware of the frustration. Do you understand how metacognition 
allows you to free yourself from the cycle where you get sucked into 
unpleasant experiences? 
 
 
The experience may continue and you may even have thoughts about the 
experience, but ultimately your higher level of metacognition will be benignly 
observing or witnesses or being aware of – those are just different ways of 
saying the same thing – the actual experience. Do you all understand what I’m 
asking you to do? 
 
 
To test yourself a little bit, whatever your number was in terms of the mindful 
count – did you find whatever level was comfortable for you? – I’d like you to 
exceed it by one or two. Just exceed it by a little bit but maintain your benign 
attention. 
 
 
If it deteriorates, that’s fine. All you’re doing is you’re trying to get sensitive 
about what quality of attention do I put on things normally? If it deteriorates 
and you catch yourself, that’s great. Do you understand where I’m going with 
this? 
 
 
Do you all understand the nature of this exercise? It’s not very long, just like 
the last one, but I want you to focus on the benign quality of your attention, 
whether it’s through curiosity, through a genuine interest, through kindness, 
through compassion, through sympathy.

Each one of us will have a different strength. I don’t care which one you 
choose provided it’s one that you can use relatively easily. Whenever you’re 
ready, off you go. 
 
 
How was that? Was that interesting? Could you compare and contrast for me 
this exercise to the one you did immediately before it? They were almost 
identical but with just that additional benign attention and a slight extra 
challenge shall we say in terms of the length that you’re doing it. How would 
you compare the two experiences? 
 
Student: I feel like when my attention was positive, I felt like I was focusing the right 
way taking the deep breath. I didn’t feel the need to have the benign 
attention. The moment I felt like I got frustrated or I felt like that somehow 
my attention got divided. That’s when I reminded myself to have the benign 
attention and be like it’s okay, don’t worry, it’s going to roll back. You’re going 
to be able to focus correctly in no time. 
 
 
Whilst I was having the benign attention, if I was feeling positive and then I 
was trying to have the benign attention, I was kind of dissociating from it, so I 
wasn’t liking it but I wanted to associate with the positive. When I was having 
a negative thing, I was using the benign attention to dissociate from it. 
 
Igor: 
Here’s an interesting thing. Here’s what I heard you say. When I had benign 
attention, I didn’t need benign attention but when I lost benign attention, I 
got benign attention onto the things that I lost my benign attention on and it 
was actually a lot better. 
 
 
All that you’ve done is when you had benign attention naturally shall we say, 
then by thinking about it what you had was thoughts about benign attention, 
and that’s the dissociation you described. You’re already there, so why mess 
with it? Do you understand what I’m saying? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Really the more you do this, the more natural it starts becoming to you and 
ultimately it should come to the point where you don’t notice that you’re 
having benign attention. You’re just attending. It just happened to be benign. 
It’s a very subtle distinction.

You’re trying to be a fish in water. You’re trying to be a fish that swims in the 
benign ocean so that everything that happens has benign attention to it 
automatically. It just becomes your default setting. It just isn’t a default 
setting that most of us have developed over time. We’ll practice some more 
and hopefully it will clarify it. 
 
Student: When I’m thinking about my benign attention on my attention, I’m thinking of 
it like a derivative. It’s a second thing which is looking on that attention. It’s 
hard to explain but basically... 
 
Igor: 
I understand. 
 
Student: … so when I’m on the first part, which is my first kind of attention, and when 
it’s good I don’t see the need to… 
 
Igor: 
I understand exactly where you’re coming from because when it’s good, when 
it’s benign, your attention is already benign and there’s no need to add an 
extra level, but when there’s something unpleasant happening like frustration 
and so on, then you take it an extra level so that you’re removing yourself 
from the frustration but you’re still being attentive. 
 
 
You’re really doing the same thing. You just have two things you’re tracking. 
In one you’re tracking just the breathing – it happens to be benignly – and in 
the other one you’re tracking your breathing and the frustration, which just 
happens to be done benignly. 
 
Student: So, you’re just like observing the body the way it’s happening? 
 
Igor: 
You’re observing whatever happens and it’s all good. It’s a very difficult thing 
to describe and in doing it there are many different variations and 
possibilities. You can be very dissociated. You can be equally associated. You 
can be both at the same time. 
 
 
This where we lack a vocabulary and all we can do is try different mental 
experiments to see if we can approximate, and then your life will start 
teaching you oh this one’s working better, and you’ll start intuiting more and 
more profound ways of doing this for yourself. Thank you. Are there any other 
comments?

Student: I hope I’m not getting too romantic here. To me it was a strong feeling of just 
– I didn’t have to add the being benign. It was more like falling back into how 
life is meant to be.  
 
 
When I was younger I was a farmer and so I know animals can feel it within 
seconds. Children can feel it. Old people can feel it and young people. 
Everybody can feel it. This is good for everyone, so it might as well be good for 
myself. 
 
Igor: 
Right. I agree with you 100%. Remember from yesterday, if we treated the 
people around us the way we treat ourselves, most of us wouldn’t have many 
friends. So, what makes them so special?  
 
 
Why not send some of that kindness or benevolence of curiosity or interest – 
whatever strengths you have – onto yourself as well? I remember one 
definition from a hypnotherapist.  
 
 
He said your job as a hypnotherapist is to pay attention to those qualities, 
those experiences in the client’s life that they’re disowning, that they’re 
hating or rejecting and accept them kindly or compassionately enough for 
long enough for them to realize they can do the same. At that point the 
transformation takes place. 
 
 
I kind of like that as a definition. It doesn’t have to be yours but hopefully 
you’re beginning to get a sense of this could be useful to me as an individual 
practicing it on myself.  
 
 
Think of it this way. If perception is projection and your inner landscape is a 
mirror of how you experience the world outside, then would you like to live in 
an inner landscape that’s pleasant, kind and interesting or one that’s deadly, 
hostile and unpleasant? 
 
 
If you’re living in the middle of a war zone, it doesn’t necessarily stop the war. 
I’m not trying to suggest that it radically changes the external reality. What it 
will change is your perception of external reality and, therefore, your ability to 
cope with it. Do you understand the distinction I’m making? 
 
 
Very often it can also change external reality because you’re no longer playing 
the same part. Have you ever watched those cheesy black and white movies 
where the hero is put on a conveyor belt with a chain saw that’s going to cut 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
216 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
them apart, and then at the last minute they manage to stick a pin inside the 
machine and it just grinds to a halt and it can’t continue cutting? 
 
 
Do you know the kind of cheesy movies I’m thinking about? Relationships 
work the same way. By relationship I don’t mean just personal relationships. It 
could be a stranger on the street also. They’re reacting to you. You’re reacting 
to their reaction of you. Then they’ll react to your reaction of their reaction, 
and that’s constantly going back. 
 
 
Provided you continue that process, it will continue going down the same 
track and if the track is not one that you find particularly pleasant or useful, 
then they’re probably not going to change because most people don’t have 
enough insight to. If they already have the insight to change, the chances that 
the interaction will be unpleasant are pretty low, so why not be that person? 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Benign attention really is the fuel that 
starts building it.  
 
 
It puts the fuel into all the other things that you’re doing, and in time of 
course it will save your bacon big time when we start going into the shadow 
land, the dark side of your personality, the one you’ve disowned and where all 
your power is being locked up. 
 
 
How many people here feel that there’s more to them that they can currently 
express? How many people here have the secret suspicion that there’s a lot of 
power in there somewhere, it’s just that you have to figure out how to get to 
it? 
 
 
Would you like to know where it is? It’s in the place you don’t want to go. One 
of the things that we’re doing here is we’re learning how to develop the 
strength and the stamina to go to the place that you don’t want to go so that 
you can go there safely enough to reclaim whatever it is you lost there. Do 
you get the idea? Are there any other comments on what we’ve done so far? 
 
Student: When I did the counting this time around and I came to nine, I went to the 
default mode. I go to when I feel confused in your seminars – fuck it. Just fuck 
it.  
 
 
So, I continued – 10, 11 – and at 12, I heard my voice as in the Batman TV 
series – and meanwhile in the unconscious mind – and it was completely 
blank.

Then I realized all right this is a good place, I’ll stay here. It had so much 
positivity in ‘meanwhile in the unconscious mind,’ and I didn’t really realize 
my intentions were benign. 
 
Igor: 
That’s when you know you’ve got it. When your attention is just naturally 
benign, that’s when it’s working the best and sometimes you have to remind 
yourself like when you’re feeling frustrated.  
 
 
That’s why you have to pull yourself back to remind yourself but actually the 
better version is the one you started with, which is you’re just doing it 
naturally because really that’s the best kind of attention to have in general 
life. 
 
 
Notice how his expression of benign attention is one that most people would 
normally say oh yes this is it, you just have to say fuck it and you’ll be great. 
You’ve got to find your own expression of it and it will take you to great 
places. 
 
 
The other that I really liked that was charming about the example there is 
once again do you see the symbolic landscape in action and how our external 
reality is used to symbolize our internal reality? He’s used the cheesy TV – the 
Batman quote – as a metaphor for his unconscious mind to express actually a 
very important thing to him. 
 
Student: I guess that’s the Bat Cave for me. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Student: My unconscious mind. 
 
Igor: 
And now suddenly we’re all the way back into a new hero’s journey. Can you 
hear it happening? Do you understand where we’re going with this? Let me 
just double check with you.  
 
 
When you did the breath count, the way you described it, it sounded like you 
were saying that you went much further than you would normally go on the 
breath count. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Student: Oh yes, I’d go to 10 but now I choose 12 and I didn’t know what would 
happen at 12, but something happened. Also my attention shifted because 
I’m counting the feeling of the nostrils when I take a breath, and they were 
suddenly more visual. I could see my nostrils turn into circles and then went 
from there and just had some extreme tranquility and calmness to it. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Again, now your senses are opening up. Technically it’s called 
synesthesia, when you can see a feeling. It’s a very natural thing. It’s just 
we’re not allowed to experience it normally because that’s not how the world 
works, and only people who have very strong synesthesia overcome the social 
conditioning against it. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: When there was noise outside when I’m trying to do the breathing, I was 
feeling annoyed and then I suddenly felt very protected with my breathing 
and calm and reassured. I just felt it’s okay, it’s fine, it’s going to be fine, just 
think about it. 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you here for a second? Can you hear in her voice the quality 
of benigness that we’re talking about? Could you hear it in his voice as well? 
There’s a different energy to it, there’s a different quality to it but they’re all 
overall positive or overall benign. Can you hear that in the way they’re 
speaking about these things? 
 
 
That’s how you know it’s working, and it’s going to be personal to you 
because why not play on your strengths? You don’t want to of course be the 
YouTube video that says yeah I have benign attention, I can breathe and it’s 
fine, yeah it’s good. 
 
 
 
Do I have benign attention at that point? You laugh because you can hear the 
incongruity, right? You’re starting to become very aware of yourselves and it’s 
interesting, isn’t it? You can actually feel frustration in part of your body 
whilst overall as a person still being positive and benign about it. 
 
 
That’s the wonder. That’s where the magic starts happening and that’s where 
things start transforming, but not because you want them to transform or 
you’re trying to force them to transform, but just because that’s what they do 
when you don’t hold onto them. 
 
 
One of the things that anger, frustration, fear and all these things do is they 
hold onto things the way they are, like the dream with the sumo wrestler.

Until he turns around and embraces him and interacts with him in a positive 
benign way, it’s going to keep chasing. You’re maintaining it. Thank you for 
that. 
 
 
Who’s enjoying themselves so far? Are you starting to learn something? Are 
you starting to appreciate subtleties in your own mental landscape? Not the 
same kind of subtleties as in mentalization. It’s a different kind of subtlety. 
Would that be fair to say?  
 
Preview (Intention) 
 
Igor: 
Would you like to take that process of discovery a little further and learn 
some more subtleties within that? 
 
 
Let’s see if we can take this general experience that we’re having and make it 
more positive without having too much effort. Would that be of interest to 
you? Here’s where we use another wonderful function of the prefrontal 
cortex, something that makes us humans relatively unique, and that’s: 
 
 Our ability to plan things. 
 
 
Whenever you do a task, unless the task is so familiar to you that it’s 
automatic, if you want to do a good job of it you mentally plan it first. You say 
okay this is what I need to do and then you can go off and do it. If you just 
start doing it, it’s like what am I doing and where am I going with this? 
 
 
Both have their value, by the way. There are different kinds of things you’ll 
discover from each one. Up until this point, you’ve just done an exercise, so 
you just dived into it and learned in the process of it.  
 
 
Now that you’re beginning to understand some of the subtleties within what 
you’re doing, why not see what happens when you plan ahead of time – in 
other words you intend for it to happen? 
 
 
What I’d like all of you to do for a moment is think about how it would be if 
you were to repeat the last exercise – the benign attention, the breath count 
and the integration breathing at the end – if it was just going to work out even 
better than before, how would you like it to work out for you?

I’d like you to just mentally rehearse that. Just think about that for a moment 
and once you’ve thought about that for a moment, then go ahead and do 
what it is you planned to do beforehand. Do you understand the instructions?  
 
 
You’re going to plan, then you’re going to do it and it’s going to be the same 
exercise as before, only the version of it that you’d really like to experience, 
and see what happens with that. Whenever you’re ready, off you go. 
 
 
Was that interesting? What happened? What kind of things happened? 
 
Student: I had a very amusing experience because I’ve been counting my breaths, but 
this time I decided with every in-breath I’m literally going to breathe in 
positive symbols up my nose like plusses. 
 
Igor: 
You’re ahead of the game. I like that. 
 
Student: And then breathe out negatives on the out-breath, and I found myself smiling 
and I was almost smiling to the point where I nearly burst out laughing. It was 
very nice, very pleasant. 
 
Igor: 
A powerful mood enhancer, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
You’re ahead of the game with the breathing thing you’re doing. I like that. 
Overall would it be fair to say this last practice was a little more intense than 
the previous ones? Was it a little bit more pleasant? That’s the wonders of 
having a prefrontal cortex. 
 
 
Who here was surprised by anything that happened? In other words, you 
rehearsed it one way, you planned it one way but when you actually did it, it 
wasn’t quite the same? Put your hands up. Excellent. Did you just go with 
whatever was happening rather than what you planned? Good. 
 
 
There’s another distinction I need to draw out here, which is we’re now 
starting to work at the level of intention. Did you notice how with the last 
session that we did when we did the mentalization processes strangely more 
stuff was coming out than yesterday and it was more unconscious than 
yesterday? 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

That’s not just the function of the fact you’ve been doing it for a day because I 
could stay on the same level and it would just become tedious. The reason 
more unconscious stuff was coming out is because I very subtly shifted the 
intention for you. Some call them expectations. Some call it a force of will. 
 
 
Again, the words don’t really matter because we don’t have the right 
vocabulary for it yet but somehow your mind through expectations, through 
intention and whatever changed the nature of the experience that you were 
getting back.  
 
 
This little mental preview that you’re doing is a very crude way of setting an 
intention of putting your willpower into action, of creating the kind of 
expectation that your unconscious mind responds to. 
 
 
You may notice I’m repeating myself in different ways. I’m just trying to get a 
message across because once again we don’t have quite the right language to 
describe it properly, but there’s a key to an intention.  
 
 
If it’s too rigid – in other words when you start engaging in the actual practice, 
here’s the breathing but later on it could be at a business meeting or 
something like that – if you’re too rigid and it has to be the way you fantasize 
about it, that’s when you start having trouble. 
 
 
When the external world doesn’t meet your expectations, you can either get 
frustrated or you can change it. A lot of people get frustrated because they 
think you shouldn’t be this way.  
 
 
Has anyone here ever been in a long-term relationship of some sort? I realize 
you have never had thoughts of the equivalent of you shouldn’t be this way, 
you shouldn’t act this way or speak this way or do these things, which tells 
you that you had a perfect idea inside of what they should be like and they 
violated it. They dared to be different to what you want them to be. 
 
 
 
The same is true of a lot of things. How many people here have rehearsed 
conversations and tried really hard to make it go exactly as they planned? It 
doesn’t really work that way, does it?  
 
 
So, the value of setting an intention, previewing something, creating an 
expectation and so on is not in that events unfold in exactly the way that you 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

planned them - for example people in competitive sports could not prepare 
themselves through visualizations. 
 
 
Think of a boxer trying to visualize a championship match. He comes out in 
the ring and says what the hell are you doing, you’re supposed to come to the 
left. Do you see where I’m going with this? Yet it’s not the content of the 
intention where the power is at. It’s the kind of format of it. It tells you to 
expect generally this type of thing. 
 
 
Would it be fair to say that all of you, even though you didn’t have quite the 
experience that you prepared for, had an equivalent experience at the very 
least, if not a better one? That’s a very important thing to understand about 
intentions, plans, preparations, expectations and so on. 
 
 
These are all in my mind synonyms for the same idea I’m trying to present to 
you. Imagine you have a mountain with various different channels and they’re 
all dry. When the rain falls they’ll fill up. If you block off some channels and 
leave one open, you’re making it very likely that’s the one that will fill up.  
 
 
All intention does is it creates a predisposition, it makes it easier for the kinds 
of things you want to have happen to happen, but the world isn’t one that 
you run with your mind – or if it is, then I’ll have a list of things that I’ll discuss 
with you.  
 
 
The world is full of people who have their own agendas, their own needs, 
their own intentions and so on, so then you have to be able to navigate 
through those – in other words be flexible in the moment whilst still having 
that vision shall we say driving you forwards. 
 
 
I’m very pleased to hear that none of you fought your intention. A lot of 
people will do that. When you think that someone should be one way but 
they act another way, what you’re really doing is you’re fighting your own 
intention. 
 
 
When you have planned a particular kind of conversation and it all starts 
falling apart because they’re not saying what you want them to say, what 
you’re doing is you’re actually violating your own intention. There are two 
ways that people fall foul of an intention. We’ll practice the other one in a 
little bit.

The first one is when they get so rigidly stuck on one way of expressing it that 
then the actual reality of expressing it – which is just as good if not better 
than it – gets blocked. 
 
 
The other way is when they have what I call the Walter Mitty Syndrome. Have 
you heard of Walter Mitty? He was basically a daydreamer who just escapes 
into a fantasy where he’s James Bond or some visionary revolutionary or 
something like that, but meanwhile in real life he’s this meek little man who’s 
kind of henpecked and his wife is domineering and he doesn’t really dare to 
do very much. 
 
 
That’s an example of someone who is dissociated. He’s divorced his intention 
from his actual action, from his real life. His inner life has been tagged as 
whatever happens; don’t do any of this in the outside world.  
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? It’s fine to have some fantasies like that 
but there’s a huge difference between a fantasy and something you can 
create a reality out of. 
 
 
It goes back to a point from yesterday – the difference between a delusion 
and a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s a very subtle thing that hopefully you’re 
beginning to get more of a feel for now. Would that be fair to say? Do you 
have any questions or comments on what we’ve done so far? 
 
Student: I actually ran into the thought of oh I can’t do that; that would be socially 
unacceptable, I can’t go there. Then I milled along and ran into that a couple 
of times. 
 
Igor: 
Whilst you were doing it here or just in general life? 
 
Student: Yes, just going through the breathing exercise. 
 
Igor: 
I’m not sure – what’s antisocial or asocial about counting your breathing 
benignly and then just sitting with it? I’m just confused as to where you’re not 
allowed to do something socially. 
 
Student: It would be like if it would display too much to the outside world. They would 
actually know what I’m thinking and who I am.

Igor: 
Oh, you’re thinking about the way you’re moving and so on. I’m not entirely 
sure what it is that you’re asking. Maybe we can talk about this more on the 
break, but the simple thing this might be is something that when we get to 
more of the symbolic landscapes, something that you can start resolving 
there. 
 
 
Maybe it’s something that you have to act out or maybe it’s something you’re 
creating on your own. I don’t know. I don’t fully understand it yet, so I’d have 
to sit down and talk to you a little bit more to figure out what’s going on 
there. 
 
 
What I’d like to do now is to see if we can take that another stage further. By 
the way, let me just point one more thing out to you. Has anyone here 
noticed how much longer your mindfulness practice is becoming today? Is it 
easy?  
 
 
 
If you think back to yesterday where doing a very short one was kind of 
frustrating and getting to be too much and you had to stop it and so on, and 
now it’s starting to increase. Why? It’s because of the quality of your 
attention.  
 
 
Your intention helps to feed into the quality of your attention. Do you 
understand that it will be easier to continue the path?  
 
Review 
 
Igor:  
So, let’s see if we can start doing more with this because really we’re talking 
about a learning process, and a learning process requires us to have material 
to learn from. 
 
 
Right now we’re using our personal experience to learn from. So, instead of 
having me pointing things out to you, how about having yourself point things 
out to you?  
 
 
What we’re going to do now to see if we can experiment with that – and 
there are a couple of versions of this that we’ll try – we’ll do the same thing as 
before.

You’ll preview this whole mindful practice where you count your breath and 
you have the integration breathing afterwards. Then you’ll do it with benign 
attention. You’ll observe your breathing going on in whatever way you wish 
to. You’ll take your count. Maybe you’ll take it a little bit further than normal 
or maybe you won’t. It’s up to you. 
 
 
Then you’ll have your normal integration breathing cycle at the end where 
you do nothing in particular. You just kind of hang out there and let your 
attention go where it needs to.  
 
 
 
At the end of it, I would like for you to mentally review what just happened. 
You may notice I haven’t given you a lot of parameters as to how to review it. 
I will in due course but I’d rather you just do whatever you do naturally first, 
and then we’ll see if we can contrast it against a different version of it. 
 
 
Just to clarify, you’ll preview, you’ll have benign attention on your breathing 
count and then you’ll have your integrative breathing where you’re just being 
aware of your breathing in whatever way comes naturally. In other words, it’s 
the exact same exercise as before.  
 
 
The only thing you’re going to add at the end now is a review where you look 
back on what you just did to evaluate it somehow. Make sense?  
 
 
She was saying in the last exercise there was intention. The preview is the 
intention. By seeing how you’re going to do it, that’s one way of setting an 
intention of how you’re going to do. It’s really the same thing, isn’t it? There 
are just other ways of doing it. 
 
Student: What do you want to achieve? 
 
Igor: 
This is nothing about what you’ll achieve in life. The only intention I’m asking 
you to do, the only preview is how benignly you’re focused on the actual 
exercise. That’s the only thing your intention is going to be focused on. 
Whenever you’re ready, go ahead and start.  
 
 
How was that? Was that interesting?

Benign Review 
 
 
Igor: 
What did the review do for you? What kind of reviews did you do and did you 
get anything out of that? Or, are you not quite sure how to answer that 
question? 
 
Student: I had a sort of feeling of not quite recursion, but I could see myself reviewing 
where I’d gone before in all of the things were floating downstream where I 
was above it or just aware of the ones that happened before. It was unending 
almost. 
 
Igor: 
It would be because there’s the past and then there’s the future, and you can 
do a lot with both. Thank you for that. What else did you guys notice? 
 
Student: Before I got to the review, I noticed a couple of times there was like a flash of 
something, like a feeling or like with a picture associated with it, and there 
were different things I found myself sort of making a decision and it was 
something quite scary like dropping into a grave or something like that, and 
when I tried to put the… 
 
Igor: 
The attention or the benign attention? 
 
Student: Thank you. That’s it. 
 
Igor: 
The labels aren’t important but I understand what you mean. Go on. 
 
Student: When I tried to put that on them, they kind of dropped out of my memory 
quite quickly, like I couldn’t sit with it like we did in the previous things, so I 
wasn’t sure what that meant. 
 
Igor: 
First of all we’re doing a slightly different practice. This is the pure 
mindfulness part of it, so the flashes that you had coming in were kind of 
intrusions in some ways. It just shows you how benign attention allows you to 
settle your attention back on your task. 
 
 
 
Your task at this point wasn’t to do a mentalization, to walk through our inner 
landscape. Your task was to be aware of your breathing. When you had your 
benign attention, did it assist that or distract from it? It helped you go right 
back to it, so it’s absolutely appropriate.

Had you done this of course in a mentalization process, then chances are the 
image would have stabilized enough for you to be able to release something 
because you’re doing something different at that point.  
 
 
Either way is fine. Either way works great because you’re still learning not to 
be affected or get sucked into a negative experience or another experience 
and so on. That’s good. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I had a very interesting experience. In the review I had a review in the review, 
and the review in the review was actually very benign. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. So, you had your whole thing, the review of the actual work. You 
did the whole session, at the end you reviewed the session and at the end of 
the review you actually reviewed the review because that’s part of the whole 
thing, right? How did it feel to have that final benign review? 
 
Student: It felt very pleasant. It felt very much like I can choose where to go. 
 
Igor: 
What we’re trying to do now is we’re starting to create a feedback loop. I 
realize that I gave you very little instructions about what kind of review to do, 
but just as you can have benign attention in the moment, why not extend that 
idea of benigness to the whole practice of it? 
 
 
Are you more likely to continue doing this when it feels good, it’s overall 
positive and you feel like you’re succeeding at it, or when it’s frustrating, you 
have to persevere and you’ve got to push through it? Which is going to keep 
you most likely motivate?  
 
 
I don’t know if you know this but there’s a little bit of research on this idea. 
Let’s take three different people learning a new skill. Let’s say it’s playing 
tennis.  
 
 
One person has an over-estimation of their abilities – in other words they 
think they play much better than they do. Another person has a very accurate 
assessment of their abilities – in other words they play just about as good as 
they think they do. The third person has a pessimistic view of their abilities – 
in other words they play much better than they think they do.  
 
 
Of the three, which do you think is going to learn tennis the quickest and get 
the best results? The one who’s got the accurate insight in terms of the skill 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
228 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that they have? Believe it or not, it’s the first one – the person who’s slightly 
delusional about how good they are. It’s the expectation again, folks. 
 
 
The unconscious mind says you want to be that good? Okay, why not? On a 
purely physical level, who’s most likely to practice – the guy who thinks he’s a 
tennis god or the one who thinks I’m just a beginner, I’m okay; or the guy who 
thinks I’m really bad? 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Are you beginning to see another 
nuance of this? Again, the difference between a delusion and a self-fulfilling 
prophecy, the difference between an intention and an expectation – let’s call 
this the New Year’s Eve Syndrome. You know where you make a New Year’s 
resolution. 
 
 
How many people actually stick to their New Year’s resolutions? If you have 
100 people making New Year’s resolutions, how many of them do you actually 
think follow through for the whole year? Two, if you’re lucky.  
 
Student: My resolution is not to make a resolution. 
 
Igor: 
Your resolution is to not make resolutions anymore and by failing at that, I 
win! So, we’re exploring a very tricky part of the psychological territory to 
understand, which is the nature of intention.  
 
 
Why do we intend some things and then fail at following up? Why do we 
make promises we can’t keep, including to ourselves? Why do we have some 
things where there is no way come hell or high water that we will fail at it? 
How does your mind make the distinction, because you think you’re doing the 
same thing but clearly you’re not? 
 
 
We want to start training our minds so that when we intend something, we 
get exactly what we want, not necessarily in the form of it but it gives us the 
nature of the thing that we’re asking for. Why is this important when it comes 
to our ASH Practice – the mentalization stuff we’ve been doing? 
 
 
Let’s say you’re having a tough day and you want to have just a mental break, 
and you like the idea of our nice psychotic woman who spends a week in a 
city under the sea that she’s the queen bee of, and you’re saying yeah I’ll do 
that. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

So, you start that but because you’re having a bad day, your unconscious 
mind defaults to the affect bridge and instead of taking you to the kingdom 
under the sea, it’s a full burn revolt? It’s giving you a tougher day now. We’re 
just following the affect bridge it’s used to. 
 
 
There is a clear disconnect between what you intended and the experiences 
you got, is there not? If you want to be able to control how you’re running 
through our inner world, you need to have some kind of way of ensuring that 
your mind actually listens to you when you ask for something. 
 
 
There is a very delicate balance because you could force it on it and then it’s a 
fantasy. A fantasy has a mild benefit, unless you go down the whole Walter 
Mitty road, but it has a mild benefit of releasing tensions and frustrations and 
so on. 
 
 
But we’re not here to have fantasies. We’re here to transform our lives, aren’t 
we? We’re here to get out of Bucket Land and you cannot get out of Bucket 
Land by fantasizing. Fantasizing is one of the ways to deal with staying in 
Bucket Land. 
 
 
So, we need to start understanding what do I need to do with my mind so that 
when I intend something, it actually happens and I get the quality of 
experience I need to have occurring at that point in time?  
 
 
It’s a very subtle thing. I find it very difficult to even talk about it, but slowly as 
you start doing this sort of stuff you’ll start noticing oh okay, I’m beginning to 
start tracing this idea of I wasn’t quite serious about it in my preview and so I 
only had a mild experience of it, or this time I really meant it and it really 
happened. 
 
 
Most of you experienced it this morning when we started doing the same tour 
of the neighborhood that you did yesterday, but by tweaking a few things and 
changing an expectation here and there, your unconscious mind starts 
spontaneously adding things to it. 
 
 
You didn’t have to force it. You didn’t have to say okay I’m going to have a 
person be there, be there, no across the street, there. You just kind of 
expected something to happen.

How many of you were surprised by what kind of movement or what kind of 
people you ended up finding inside of your mentalization? That surprise is 
good. It shows you that your unconscious mind is doing it for you, but here’s 
the key thing. Who chose for that experience to actually happen? 
 
 
It was a co-conscious decision. You chose the nature of the experience. It 
chose the actual version of it to present it to you. That’s when you have a 
good relationship, isn’t it?  
 
 
Think of a captain of a steamboat. Actually it could be any kind of ship, but 
let’s stick with the steamboat because I just had a funny metaphor for it. Is his 
job to shovel coal so they can go faster? Is his job to wash the deck so people 
will have a nice experience of it? Is his job to go in the galleys and cook the 
meals so everyone can feed? 
 
 
No, because whilst he’s busy trying to clean the ship and fuel it and all the rest 
of it, the ship’s running aground on an iceberg. Your job is to be the captain, 
to send instructions. The rest of your mind’s job is to act out on those 
instructions, but you have a very delicate relationship. 
 
 
Just as you can have an overbearing captain who basically causes a mutiny, 
you can be so unpleasant to yourself that your unconscious mind decides to 
say screw you buddy. We’ve all had an experience of that, have we not?  
 
 
Again, we’re talking about a very nebulous relationship that we’re not very 
used to, and we’re starting to eke out experiences to get us more attuned to 
that. Do you get a sense of that? Are there any other comments or questions? 
 
Student: I just wanted to say that I found it very useful – this exercise – because usually 
when we are in conflict with people it’s very verbal and it will bump back and 
forth and you don’t get anywhere. I was relating to a group of people and I 
know it’s related to something from my childhood. 
 
 
Still I struggled with it, and I discovered in this exercise that they kind of lined 
up around me. I was surrounded by them. I discovered also that I could just 
make an action just with this benign attention, just give a symbol instead of 
using any words and it was very much a relief.

Igor: 
Really in terms of going into a symbolic landscape here, you have learned the 
value of these two steps – respect and equanimity. Instead of engaging in the 
fight, you aren’t part of it.  
 
 
You’re present but you’re not engaging in it. Instead of disrespecting the place 
– of course all inside your mind – by showing respect, by giving a gift of some 
sort will flesh these things out a little bit more as we continue, it changed the 
nature of the experience and that’s giving you a fighting chance to actually 
end the fights that you’ve been having in real life. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: A wonderful way of making a shortcut. 
 
Igor: 
So, I’d like to do another version of this before we have a lunch break. Is that 
okay with you guys? By the way, have you noticed how much longer your 
meditations are becoming now? How natural is it becoming to do that? Is it 
natural, isn’t it? 
 
 
That’s the way I think it should be. I don’t think anything should be forced. I 
know there are some people who disagree with me. They’re the hardcore 
Buddhists who say no, a 30-day retreat, no food, go. I prefer to win. I prefer to 
actually be able to maintain the practice, so building up incrementally works 
very well for me and hopefully it does for you too. 
 
 
Even if you want to race ahead, by all means do so, just make sure you take 
some of these lessons with you to assist you in that process. Does that make 
sense to you?  
 
 
In the last version you had that little review of the mindful breathing, and 
hopefully you started paying attention to the kind of the things that worked 
and the kind of things that didn’t work and so on. From what I hear you guys 
saying, you probably did this already but in case you did not, all I want to do is 
add a quality at the end here. 
 
 
Instead of just reviewing your mindful count, your breath count, your 
integration breathing and your preview beforehand setting the intention, 
make sure you review it with the same kind of benign attention that you’re 
applying to the actual exercise itself.  
 
 
The quickest way to habituate something is to use it a lot, so the more you 
use a benign kind of attention on something the more it’s going to actually be 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
232 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
there for you when you actually need it. Does that make sense to you? Are 
there any questions on the exercise? In that case the best thing to do is to not 
talk about it. Off you go. 
 
 
Who’s starting to feel the whole process intensifying? That last session was six 
times longer than the way we started yesterday. Do you see how natural it is 
to progress? You’re progressing from success to success. You’re not 
progressing from failure – fight, fight, fight – failure – fight, fight, fight some 
more.  
 
 
That’s why that last review is a benign review. This is called the Law of 
Successive Approximations. If you want to walk a mile, you don’t take a one-
mile step. It’s very hard unless you have very, very long legs or you have those 
magic seven-league boots, but then it’s more than a mile.  
 
 
The easiest way to succeed at something is to just keep succeeding and 
building on your successes, whatever those are. Yesterday we learned about 
how to scale down the difficulty of something so that we can start succeeding 
at it and then build it up slowly but surely. 
 
 
By adding different tasks that we’ve been doing, can you see how as the skill 
has been progressing, you’ve still been staying in that flow channel more or 
less? How many of you got bored in the last few sessions? One person? Two 
people? You got bored whilst actually doing the meditation parts?  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And then you added something and it took you back out of it. This is how you 
measure your own progression. As soon as you find yourself popping into 
boredom, you add something to it – the benign attention, the subtlety in the 
breathing and all that sort of stuff.  
 
 
The rest of you are clearly within that channel. If you start getting stressed or 
frustrated, you know that you’ve added too much, so you can scale it back 
again. This is one of the ways that you can keep yourself on track very easily. 
Are there any questions or comments so far? 
 
Student: Towards the end after the breathing, I started having like flashes and pictures 
popping into my head, like I would jump off the Toronto Tower suddenly, and 
then some other voice or I’m telling myself no this is not supposed to happen, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
233 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you’re supposed to review it, so we will switch it off now and then perhaps 
we’ll come back later, or this is not part of the exercise, now you must review.  
 
 
I had it several times in the last two exercises. I even would open my eyes, 
look around and see people still with their eyes closed, and then I’d close my 
eyes and just get back into the current. 
 
Igor: 
Your experience is pretty much the same as the lady over here who had other 
flashes of things coming up. You can resolve it anyway you want by saying no 
actually this is the one that I want to focus on here, which is a fine response. 
The only question I would ask you to ask yourself is how benign was your 
focus when you really focused?  
 
 
In other words, were you being judgmental of these flashes coming in or were 
you like oh this is pretty cool, now let’s get back to what I’m here to do? I’ll 
make you a promise, I guarantee this – and it doesn’t really matter which way 
you did it of course. I’ll make you a promise though.  
 
 
The more benign your switching your focus is, the easier it will be to make the 
transition back again. In fact typically, just like this lady over here 
experienced, they just disappear and then you say okay fine, I’ll wait for 
another time. 
 
 
What the integration breathing is doing for you is it’s basically opening the 
door up to the unconscious. You’ve done lots of mental work, stuff has been 
accumulated and, because the integration breathing is basically where there’s 
nothing really going on, your unconscious mind has an opportunity to do stuff 
with it. 
 
 
It would be very useful to us when we start going back to the ASH Practices – 
the mentalization and so on – because it will make you better at it, or at least 
those portions of it you wish to improve. 
 
 
But if you fall into the trap of being judgmental about it – and by judgmental I 
mean judgmental in a negative sense like oh, I shouldn’t do this, this is bad, 
this is no good and so on – then you’re going back to the idea of frustration. 
You’re adding a negative spin on what you’ve done and that’s going to taint 
the experience.

If you think about once again which of the activities you look forward to 
actually do engage in – the ones that you feel a little bit frustrated about and 
annoyed with or the ones where you feel like oh this is great, I have a great 
time with it. 
 
 
So, you’re creating future positive expectations, which once again is another 
way of dealing with intention. Do you see how the idea of an intention has 
lots of different subtleties? There’s the idea of preparing for something going 
forward. There’s the idea of having the experience in a way that you can 
predict future positiveness as well, so you want to be motivated to it. 
 
 
When your review is positive as well – benign shall we say – then once again 
you’re pulling things of value out of that rather than looking at all the things 
that aren’t working.  
 
 
You can look at those negative things – for example when I did a review, I 
looked at the mistakes I made, very benignly saying as soon as you get ready 
for it, that’s the bit where you’ll have another chance to improve and I 
enjoyed it. I kind of smiled at myself.  
 
 
I’m actually looking forward to doing this exercise again when you guys have 
gone home – so, everyone go now – because I know what I want to do next. 
I’m enthused by it. Part of the intention is also part of your motivation, and it 
all starts linking together.  
 
 
By the way, that’s one of the reasons why people fail so often to follow up on 
their intentions. It’s because they don’t have motivation behind it. Now 
you’re learning how to put the right spins on your intentions so that they can 
grow. It’s like a little seed planted in the ground. You want to make sure that 
you water it properly so that it grows and becomes useful to you.  
 
Student: I had less of a question than a comment. I appreciate your use of benign as 
opposed to positive. I know you are saying positive sometimes but benign, 
malignant, positive, negative – I find that much more helpful. I feel like doing 
the exercises.  
 
 
I feel much more at ease with your utilization of those words, plus the 
mentalization is even more relaxing because sometimes it’s positivity on 
steroids, which I don’t find very helpful to me, nor if I do it to someone else it 
isn’t very helpful.

Igor: 
I agree. Thank you for saying that. I chose the word on purpose because the 
word positive is somewhat overused in our culture, and a lot of people have 
an association along the lines of yeah! Let’s be positive in our review. Yes, I 
did it! 
 
 
That’s fine. It’s a form of positive but there are many others and that version 
doesn’t really fit everyone. So, thank you for saying that and for noticing.  
 
Student: When we first did the exercise, I set my intention as I want to experience joy 
when I’m doing this, and I didn’t experience joy but what I experienced was 
peace, and what came into my mind was actually this is good. So, I just went 
with it. 
 
 
When we went through it this time, I said my intention was I want to 
experience a positive feeling. So, I went through it but what I actually 
experienced was sadness and I felt a bit bewildered, but I thought okay I’ll just 
go with this. Then when I was doing the integration breathing, what came into 
my mind was the experience was positive because you’ve released an 
emotion. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you, and you’ve just hit the heart of what I mean by benign. Again this 
is where people get sidetracked with the idea of positive because they think it 
has to be upbeat, it has to be joyful, excited, exhilarated or something like 
that.  
 
 
There are actually a lot of good things that can happen when it’s negative. The 
difference is in your mindset. Did you hear the benign attention there? What 
was the benigness? Oh, I’ll just go with this.  
 
 
Did you hear the quality of benigness? It was a very accepting, very relaxed 
part of it and as a result of it you received a gift, shall we say, from your 
unconscious that you didn’t know you’d get. Are you beginning to get another 
nuance with what we’re doing here? 
 
 
It’s a very difficult thing to describe and it’s very often missed, but hopefully 
your experiences are starting to shape towards what we’re talking about. 
Thank you for that. Are there any other questions or comments?

Student: To me it seems when at first or still when we do this first meditation, we go 
astray and then come back. This might be the natural learning process of it’s a 
bit too hard, so the unconscious takes a break and then it comes back and 
what screws it up is a negative command. So, the benign attention is letting 
the unconscious do what it was trying to do to help us all our life long. It was 
not oh no, I have to concentrate. Oh no, I didn’t concentrate. Oh no, I’m so 
bad and all this.  
 
 
The natural way of learning fast or accomplishing things fast is in doing a little 
step and then waiting a little, and then the next little step and waiting a little, 
and not keeping at it all the time. This actually is the slower way and most of 
us were taught it’s the other way. 
 
Igor: 
There’s a nice phrase one of our trainers came up with which I like, which is 
you can do things the slow-fast way or the fast-slow way. We’re currently 
going the slow-fast way. Do you know the saying what you resist will persist; 
what you accept you’ll get the power to transform? 
 
 
That’s just another way of saying benign attention, isn’t it? Do you see how 
we’re trying to come at the same idea from various different nuances, 
because once again our vocabulary is inadequate for describing precisely what 
we want?  
 
 
So, we need to shape experiences and learn from them to understand things 
in a slightly different way. If this was just written as a text that you have 
benign attention, you’d all have all kinds of different illusions about what that 
might be.  
 
 
For example, you might have been frustrated with yourself for not feeing joy. 
What the hell am I feeling calmness for? I want joy. But actually it doesn’t 
matter. Then you have true equanimity.  
 
 
Whether it’s sadness, whether it’s joy, whether it’s calmness, your mind still 
navigates with that pure thread of awareness, which allows the general 
healing process to occur and your learning process and so on.  
 
Student: I have a particular reference experience that I’ve been working with, which is 
that I have a young baby at home. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations.

Student: I spend a lot of time watching her do things, and of course she can’t really do 
anything right but she doesn’t do anything wrong from my point of view. So, 
I’m trying to take that same quality into my own self-observation. 
 
Igor: 
I love it. In fact I think I’ve rarely heard a better description of benign 
attention. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: Many years ago, I was on a plane from Canada to Britain and it was so many 
years ago that we were invited into the cockpit.  
 
Igor: 
Wow. 
 
Student: There was a huge array of dials. I mean it was mindboggling. I said to the pilot, 
how do you deal with this and he said oh we don’t look at them, but if 
something moves it gets our attention because they have like soft gaze or soft 
eyes or benign attention. 
 
Igor: 
Basically as long as it’s all working okay, they don’t even have to pay 
attention, but as soon as something changes they’ll know where to look and 
what it means, right? 
 
Student: Right. So, what I’ve discovered for myself is that I have this wonderful pilot 
with me and I started out with a good intention of really counting my breaths 
and being very present. Of course it doesn’t happen.  
 
 
I mean there’s a huge space between the breaths where all kinds of hell 
breaks loose, but the pilot is there to say there’s something happening there, 
so bring it back. 
 
Igor: 
There you go. 
 
Student: That was my experience and it was wonderful. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for sharing that. It kind of reminds me of an old story I heard about 
the Founder of Aikido, one of the martial arts. It’s all flowing and nice. He was 
just berating a student for losing his balance again, and the student in 
frustration turns around to Ueshiba – the Founder of Aikido – and says well 
it’s all right for you. You’re the big grand master. You never lose your balance.

He laughs at him and says look, I lose my balance as much as everyone else 
does. The only difference is that when I lose my balance, I catch it again 
before anyone else notices. That really is a great skill to have in life and one 
that you’re beginning to develop here again. 
 
 
Do you see again how a lot of things are happening but it could be easily 
missed because they’re very small and very subtle? They’ll become larger and 
stronger as you pay attention to them because of the Law of Attention of 
course, but for now I think you’ve had enough and I think you deserve a nice 
break for lunch.

DVD 7 – Mindful Movement, Diving Into 
Spontaneous Unconscious Content & The 
Strange New World Exercise 
 
 
Mindful Movement 
 
Igor: 
This morning we started a set of mentalizations, which looked very similar to 
what we did yesterday but actually had very different results, and the reason 
for that is because your expectations, your intentions started changing and 
your mind always gives you what you intend if your intention has been shall 
we say properly aligned – in other words it hasn’t learned to ignore you when 
you want something because you’ve basically abused it in some way. 
 
 
Then right after that when we did the mindfulness training, we started adding 
this idea of intentionality to it, and your mindfulness work started becoming 
significantly better. You started having longer time with the sessions, they 
were overall more comfortable, you had more insights and you started being 
aware of more of the nuances within that.  
 
 
What I want to do now is to see if we can start moving away from or start 
breaking free from the very structured mentalizations that are based on your 
personal memories of a spatial environment, which is a very strong way your 
mind has for creating these mentalizations.  
 
 
You’ve already gone into the idea or territory of memories to a certain extent 
and accidentally, shall we say, have gone through memories. What I want to 
do now is if we can actually start creating symbolic landscapes that will have 
value to you, which will be blank canvases that the unconscious mind can fill 
in with you so that it has more freedom to fill it with symbols that are of value 
to you. 
 
 
Whilst we’re doing that, we also want to see if we can actually use our rules of 
Flight Club and put that into those sessions to see how that improves our 
performance.

Let me ask you this. Who here has had quite a good lunch? Who here has had 
a bit too much lunch and you feel that little after-lunch – if you make me be 
mindful today, I’m going to be so mindless that I’m going to fall asleep? This 
brings up an important point, which is going to be important for our 
mentalization practice. 
 
 
You see, it’s all good doing it in here where we’ve created an environment 
that is relatively benign and relatively easy to do this work in, but how do you 
do this work when you really can’t, when you’re stressed, when things are 
loud and noisy outside, when you can’t quite seem to focus properly?  
 
 
We need a mechanism to start collecting enough attention to be able to do 
the work, the mentalization, with enough competency for it to start becoming 
more and more intense for us.  
 
 
So far of course you have the mindfulness practice, which is very good, but if 
you’re anything like me you can get to the point where things are just so 
hectic that even being mindful of a single breath is like what was that again? It 
becomes very difficult. 
 
 
What do you do at that point? Would you like to have a simple solution to 
that? What I’d like you to do is just put your pens and papers on the floor for 
a moment. Maybe leave your eyes open for this one. I’m going to break your 
expectations.  
 
 
If you would, just stand up for a moment. I want you to very carefully, without 
looking, without touching and so on – but for Werner of course it will be a 
little different for you and I’ll work with you in a second separately – I’d like 
you to sit right back down again but just keep your weight on the chair very 
lightly and then stand right back up again. 
 
 
Oh, Werner, very good. I like that – and then right back up again. Is that easy 
to do? How much mindfulness did you have whilst you were doing that? 
Middling? Let’s see if you can actually do this mindfully.  
 
 
To help or to assist you in your mindfulness, instead of doing this at your 
normal pace, I would like you to at least half it, if not slow it down even more 
than that. In other words, however slow you think it is to sit down slowly, I 
want you to go slower than that but when you touch the chair, I don’t want 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
241 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you to sit on it. I want you to barely hover on top of it before standing back up 
again equally slowly. 
 
 
It will be something that’s nice and simple and dramatic. I’ve got a bar stool so 
I have a much easier time than you guys do. Then all the way back up again. I 
want you to be aware of all the sensations that your body is generating as you 
do that. Please go and do that now. 
 
 
Some of you may have noticed that the point when you start leaving the chair 
is a lot faster than everything else. Have you noticed this? That’s because 
that’s the point that requires the most effort. So, let’s see if you can do it 
again and just hover at that point where you’re about to leave the chair and 
just wait there for a moment, and see how slowly you can make that 
transition.  
 
 
If you go straight up it’s not very easy, but if you start tipping your weight a 
little bit it starts getting a little bit easier. Again just pay attention to what 
your body does. Off you go. 
 
 
Those of you who are settling back in your chair noticed that the idea of 
sitting down accelerates you at the end there. Then just sit down normally, so 
we can have a little discussion about that. Most of you are looking at me 
thinking what the hell is going on here? This is so wrong, physical work at a 
mental training program? 
 
 
What I want you to pay attention to for a moment is how does your body feel 
right now? Energized? A little bit more simulated? A little bit more energy? 
How does your mind feel right now compared to earlier on? Is it a little bit 
clearer? 
 
 
You know how we talked about using the external environment to control our 
internal environment? Moving your body through space physically is an 
important part of that. Exercise is a very loaded term for us. By exercise I 
mean basically moving your body through space against some form of 
resistance – is very important to us.  
 
 
Who here had to actually focus quite a bit to make sure they didn’t fall over 
whilst trying to sit down, and then when you were sitting down you kind of 
lost it a little bit because you were relaxed, and you had to catch your 
attention again and then stand back up again? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Did you notice that kind of thing going on? Some of you of course actually sat 
down and barely hovered over the chair, which means your attention had to 
stay locked before you started standing back up again. Whenever you exert 
yourself physically, it collects your attention. 
 
 
You can take an empty box up the stairs and chat to your friend and not think 
about it. As soon as that box is heavy, can you talk to your friend as easily or 
do you say something like oh, just give me a minute, let me just take this 
upstairs because it’s a little heavy? 
 
 
Is your brain in your arms? Do you need your biceps to be able to think? No, 
but you do need attention on your biceps in order to hold the weight that 
you’re unaccustomed to. Notice it doesn’t even have to be a heavy weight. It 
just has to be a weight that’s heavier than you’re accustomed to holding 
habitually. 
 
 
If you’re used to working with heavy loads, this won’t be as useful to you. You 
have to go up another notch. Whatever that motion is, is unimportant. You 
can do a push-up against the wall – what you just did there by the way is 
basically a beginner level squat. You can do yoga. You can do any of these 
positions. 
 
 
The point is: 
 
1. It has movement.  
 
 
This is where yoga is not as useful unless it’s something like Ashtanga because 
it holds postures, although actually I guess you could do it that way too. You 
want to have movement. 
 
2. You want the movement to be more arduous than you’re normally 
accustomed to because it collects attention. 
 
 
If you then use that movement and use it to do it mindfully – in other words 
you do the movement very slowly, so your mind is attached to it and very 
slowly to complete moving the other way – it has an effect of both energizing 
you because your body is really what creates the physical energy, and 
stabilizing your attention at the same time.

For example, if you’re having trouble falling asleep at night, one of the things I 
like to do is I’ll do maybe 10 push-ups against the wall – not against the floor. I 
don’t want to be so amped up that I can’t sleep anymore, but I want to have 
enough that all my mental attention can no longer be on the thoughts 
spinning around in my head. 
 
 
As soon as that attention is focused onto the task that I’m doing, the physical 
task, I’ve collected it enough that I can then re-channel that attention into 
whatever work I want to be doing. Do you understand the idea behind this? 
 
 
This sounds a little abstract right now. Would that be fair to say? So, what I 
want you to do is have an experience of it. I’d like for you to just create first of 
all an intention – in other words think about doing this standing up, sitting 
down, standing up again and sitting down.  
 
 
So, do two rounds of it as a setting of intention thing. Then I’d like you to 
actually perform it, do it. At the end up that, I’d like for you to close your eyes 
and go through a mentalization process. I don’t care which one you do – a 
tour of the neighborhood, a treasure hunt for a color or a sensation. It doesn’t 
matter. The point is I would like you to notice how your experience is. 
 
 
Let’s do a comparison of that. Quickly just close your eyes and choose a brief 
mentalization that you can do right now of any of the ones you’ve done so far. 
Not a mindfulness practice but an actual mentalization where you’re actually 
walking through your house or the neighborhood.  
 
 
You can do it as the Alphabet Game. You can do it as a treasure hunt. You can 
do it as just a tour. You can do it at a familiar or an unfamiliar location. I don’t 
care which you do. Just briefly do that just to get a sense of what it’s like.  
When you’ve done that, just come on back with your eyes open. It’s a very 
brief quick one. 
 
 
You noticed roughly how easy that was, right? What I want you to do now is 
mentally prepare yourself – in other words think about slowly standing up, 
slowly sitting down but not actually putting your weight on the chair, just 
touching the chair with your backside, slowly rising again, slowly coming back 
down again and then you can sit properly.

After that second iteration, I’d like for you to close your eyes and repeat the 
same exercise you did now so that you can contrast the two. The key is on 
slow. Off you go. 
 
 
When you’ve finished that, come on back so that we can have a discussion. 
What did you notice? How did the two versions of pretty much the same 
exercise compare to each other?  
 
Student: Between the two, the first one was fuzzier and much quicker because there 
was less detail to see, and the second time it was just like I could just go 
around and there was so much more detail that it sort of slowed me down. 
 
Igor: 
Right. Did anyone else notice this sort of thing happening? Overall was the 
quality of the second one – the one which was preceded by some form of 
mindful movement or mindful exercise – more satisfying, more vivid or a 
richer quality to it than the first version? 
 
 
We saved this particularly until after the lunch break because we kind of 
loaded the distinction for you a little bit more. It’s very hard for me to give 
you a really hard time in here and put you under pressure so that you can 
actually see what it looks like in real life. 
 
 
The problem with just trying to do a mental exercise when everything is going 
on is unless you’re experienced with calming your own mind, controlling your 
mind and so on, you need an external metaphor to show you how to do it.  
 
 
Here’s what people do when they’re rushed. Okay, done it. That’s my physical 
equivalent of mentally seeing something and it’s done. It’s erratic, it’s not 
centered, it’s not settled and so on.  
 
 
By using your physical body – which you have much more control over, or at 
least most people have more control over their physical mechanisms than 
their mental mechanisms – it not only becomes an analogy for how to work 
within the mind, but it automatically does it because it collects your attention 
and the slow movement, the calm movement allows that focus to be slower 
and calmer, and it also – as you noted – starts energizing you. 
 
 
In other words, you’re creating more physical energy, which has nowhere to 
go. What are you going to do with that energy you just created by moving 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
245 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
your body? You can start using it in your mentalizations. Hence, they become 
more vivid, richer, calmer and so on. 
 
 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re doing here? In some respects it’s 
actually the same thing you did earlier when you did the mindful breathing – 
the breathing count – followed by the mentalization, only this is a more vivid 
version of that. This is mindful movement. Breathing is a movement. It’s just a 
much easier movement. 
 
 
So, the rule of thumb for you is this: 
 
 The more distracted you are, the more mindful movement will help 
you refocus again. 
 
 
In other words, I tend to go for more strenuous. Some of you instead of go 
strenuous may go for more iterations – in other words instead of doing one or 
two, you might do five or 10. 
 
 
Note we’re not doing this for body building, strength training and so on – 
although the two are very closely related. We’re doing it specifically because 
of the impact it has on your mind and the two are very strongly related.  
 
 
Some doctors, for example, are now waking up to this wonderful idea that 
instead of medicating people as your first port of call, they give them a 
prescription of exercise. 
 
 
I don’t know if you know this, but if the whole world were to do 30 minutes of 
aerobic exercise every day with their heartbeat elevated, the use of 
medication would probably drop by 90%.  
 
 
That’s my guesstimate. It’s because most of the things that people go to 
medications for, their body will do for you when it’s allowed to move 
regularly, which our culture really doesn’t really allow it to do. We’re using it 
to stabilize our attention to allow us to be able to do our mental 
concentration more easily. 
 
 
So, for the rest of today for the exercises, can I ask you to use some kind of 
slightly strenuous, slow movement? You can use the chair squat if you wish 
but if you want to do something different, by all means do so, but it has to be 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
246 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
a slightly strenuous, slow movement so that you can do it very mindfully as 
your centering practice, and then do your mentalization as well. 
 
 
Later on we’ll have another chat about other things that this can do for you, 
and this will at some point be a wonderful lifeline to you guys, but we’ll talk 
about that a little bit later on when we get to that point. Over to you guys. Are 
there any comments or questions on that? 
 
Student: On a very similar note, for the past four months I’ve had a daily yoga practice 
of about 30 minutes and that has done absolute wonders for actually stilling 
and giving silence to my mind, and doing meditation afterwards. 
 
Igor: 
In some ways, you can think of your mind as being like a pet dog. If you don’t 
walk it then it will go nuts in your house. Unfortunately our culture has made 
it so convenient not to move that most of us don’t. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: And I’ve learned some new things here too as well. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I wanted to precede that for the practice we’re about to do 
because you’re going to require a little bit more of the right kind of attention, 
so this will help you a lot to do the kinds of things we’re going to do now. 
 
 
You have a choice. Do you want to go into the deep end and then work your 
way backwards, or do you want to start at the shallow end of the pool and 
work into the depths? Which do you prefer? Hands up if you want to go to the 
deep end. Hands up if you want to go to the shallow end. Oh, the deep end 
has it. Sorry, folks. Don’t worry. We’ll end up getting wet one way or the 
other. 
 
Strange New World 
 
Igor: 
All right for the deep end, let’s do this. I’d like you to start off with a bit of 
mindful movement like the sort of thing you’ve done here. I don’t care how 
many repetitions you do. I want you to pay attention – hence the mindfulness 
part – until you have a sense that your mind is calm and focused enough for 
you to do any internal work.  
 
 
If it’s one iteration, that’s great. If it takes five, that’s great. You get to decide 
for yourself because how on Earth would I know? Once you’ve done that, you 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
247 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
have a choice again whether you work with a partner or not. Again as time 
goes by, I encourage you to increasingly do it on your own but you can do it 
any way you prefer.  
 
 
Once you’ve done that, what I want you to do is sit down, close your eyes and 
without thinking, just find a place you’ve never seen before, a strange new 
world shall we say, and start describing it. Do you understand the exercise? 
Do you wish a demonstration or do you just want to do it? 
 
 
I’ll give you a quick demonstration. I see an ocean. There are waves kind of 
rolling in. I’m standing in a boat. It’s a wooden decking. It’s actually a very low 
railing. It’s almost up to my ankles or something. It’s very flat with wooden 
boards going down there. The ocean seems to be calming down. It’s actually 
one of these very crystal clear kind of almost reefs.  
 
 
It’s kind of light blue and I see kind of little fish with yellow and black bands 
kind of darting around. There’s one over there with a little red nosey sort of 
thing, so that’s good. I’m looking around.  
 
 
Actually, over there I can see the beach kind of – there’s a beach kind of as 
the beach kind of comes in, so I’m actually very close to the beach there, so I 
could actually step out and wade towards it but I don’t do that right now. 
 
 
Then I can see – I want to say a ship but it’s actually more of a boat. It’s flat 
bottomed. There’s a flat thing. There’s a little post in the middle with square 
sails. It’s a very small thing and there’s a little seat in the back and it’s got 
some strings you can pull so that the sail will kind of turn this way, and there’s 
a little rudder there so you can steer a little bit as well. 
 
 
Do you get the idea? I don’t need you to do anything with it. It’s just 
someplace you’ve never been or seen before. With or without your partners, 
off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m on top of a tennis ball. I’m on the pattern around the tennis ball. It’s 
turning into a forest down the horizon. The sun is a red golf ball and the sky is 
purple and the clouds are pink. It’s a strange feeling to walk on rubber. The 
sun rose and turned black.

There are some trees to my left that must have sprung up from that weird 
material that the tennis ball is made of. There’s something else and I guess I 
can’t really say what it is but I’ll stay with it for a while. That’s a shoe. Yeah, 
it’s a shoe. The shoe turned into the boot from the monopoly game.  
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting? Talk me through it. What kind of things happened?  
 
Student: Previously I would hear people talking or water pouring and things that would 
annoy me a little bit because it would distract me, and I found that this was 
more like a dream. I started incorporating it in.  
 
 
You know how when you have to go the bathroom in a dream, you dream of 
toilets? So, I thought that was rather interesting that my mind was working as 
though I was in a dream. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, a lot of our frustrations are basically the pent-up-ness of not having 
moved our bodies properly, and by discharging some of that it makes it a lot 
easier. Your mind’s more likely to work out with you.  
 
 
Do you see the value of just collecting your attention in this way and working 
some of your frustrations out before you start the mental practice, so you 
have that little bit of an edge in terms of the clarity and the ease with which 
you do it? It’s like a more intense version of the breath count. 
 
Student: You see when I sat up and down, I fell down four times. I was panting. So, 
when I sat down and I got this vision of standing at the edge of a cliff and then 
I dove from there – I made a dive. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I went swimming to an island which was close by, and I found that my panting 
was actually synchronous with after swimming how I was panting. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. It’s the same point here again. This time your body’s incorporating 
what you’re doing into your practice. The thing I really like about this idea of 
mindful movement is it’s such a useful thing, not only because it actually 
gathers your attention up but actually it prevents a big problem in the self-
improvement field in general.

Most mental practice trainings spend all their time focusing on visualize this, 
imagine that, do this, think about these things and so on. That’s all wonderful 
stuff, but what’s happening to their bodies whilst they’re doing it all? They 
neglect their very physical bodies, and we are physical beings as much as we 
are mental and emotional and other beings. 
 
 
This makes sure that it reminds you not to neglect your body. Who enjoyed 
doing that little mindful movement thing? Who here dislikes doing exercise 
normally? That’s surprisingly few of you.  
 
 
In our culture we have a very negative set of associations to exercise. We 
think of the gym. We think of it as boring and hard. It’s this, that and the 
other. That’s why people don’t do it. Whereas this is relatively enjoyable, isn’t 
it? It’s kind of like the mindful training we did on the very first day where we 
started counting your breaths rather than going for an arbitrary target, like a 
minute or so, so that we can have a very precise sense of what we’re doing. 
 
 
One of the things that I hope very much for you and one of the things that I 
definitely focus on myself for, is how do we get back into our bodies, because 
our culture really pushes us out of it? A lot of problems that we have can very 
easily fix when we’re happily, back inside our bodies. 
 
 
So, this ensures that whatever mental practice you do also incorporates 
enough physical practice that you don’t lose touch with it, which means it can 
be very grounding. Are there any other experiences? 
 
Student: The only way I could make friends with my subconscious because it was just 
pretty smart-assed and told me that there was no place that I hadn’t already 
been because I’ve already been there and it just seemed to lead me in pretty 
amorphous-land. 
 
Igor: 
Have you been to Neptune? 
 
Student: No, it was red, kind of like the images you see on the back of your mind. 
 
Igor: 
Again, when I say a place, it doesn’t have to be a real place. I imagine there 
are a lot of places you haven’t even imagined yet. Just use that as a filter 
maybe for the next round because we’re going to start collecting landscapes 
that are going to be of value to us.

Right now we’re just doing some world building. It’s a very crude world we’re 
building but we’re going to get used to that.  
 
Student: In mine there were large toadstools and then a door and then a place with 
large fish oil tablets and then – I mean it doesn’t have to have any real… 
 
Igor: 
It’s definitely a little different, right? 
 
Student: Yes, it doesn’t have to have any… 
 
Igor: 
Let’s have a little chat about why we’re doing this. I mean this is just an 
imagination game, right? In fact this particular exercise – not the sitting and 
standing thing but this strange new world exercise, a friend of mine Robin 
Manuel, the hypnotic storyteller – I think he came up with this one. 
 
 
He uses it to get people’s creative juices flowing for storytelling in general. So, 
why are we doing it? We’re not here to do storytelling. We’re not here to play 
imagination games. It’s not improv theater. What’s the point of doing this?  
 
 
 
Remember, we’re trying to instill in us the seven rules of Flight Club – the five 
that we’ve already acquired here – so we can start developing inner 
landscapes that will let us do things of value in the next few days when we 
actually get to that point. 
 
 
Let me ask you this. How many of you discovered the landscape that you 
popped into rather than creating it? In other words, how many of you chose 
ahead of time I’m going to do this; and how many of you just decided I don’t 
know what it’s going to be, close my eyes, oh this is interesting? Who was 
surprised by it? Excellent. 
 
 
So, the first rule of Flight Club is being adhered to. The unexpected is always 
more valuable than the expected because it’s more unconscious. My hope for 
you is as you do your practice that you’ll constantly be surprised by what 
happens.  
 
 
Every time you’re surprised, it is a sure sign that whatever has happened is an 
unconscious thing rather than you choosing it, because how can you be 
surprised by stuff you’ve actually chosen?

Student: I was having trouble in the beginning seeing anything and then I saw like this 
tropical forest, and then I was standing in front of a river and then there was a 
waterfall. It was like this huge waterfall coming down and then there were all 
these gold coins in the stream.  
 
 
Then the stream went down and I looked down the stream and at the very 
end of the stream there was this giant pile of gold coins, and like off in the 
distance kind of a city.  
 
 
Then there were some stairs walking down the stream, so I walked down the 
stairs and then there was a corner I turned down, and I went to a city. As I 
carried down the road, the road got to be kind of scary. It was really dark. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here a second. When the road started getting kind of 
scary, at that point did you just sit with that? Did you pause and let that 
scariness sit there or did you just continue your journey? 
 
Student: You know what? I was actually okay with it but I found that it was unusual. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Well, it definitely sounds surprising. I personally haven’t found a 
river of gold, and I’ve looked. 
 
Student: So, I carried on through the sketchy part of town. Anyway I got to a theater 
and I went in the theater and I sat down in a chair, and when I was watching 
the screen it was black and then all of the sudden there was a white kind of 
background with black writing, and it said follow your unconscious mind. Then 
I went outside of the theater and then all the gold was there – a pile of gold. 
 
Igor: 
Symbolically speaking, that’s actually a pretty cool thing. Give him a round of 
applause for that. Here’s what I liked about that particular example. Did he 
discover things? It was unexpected. He’s not trying to create them. He’s not 
saying I would like this and it comes. He just waited and it kind of came to 
him, right? 
 
 
Did he move around inside of that landscape? Of course that creates a little 
bit of stability. Did he interact with something? You could call maybe the 
cinema screen having a form of interaction, but there was nothing really there 
to interact with, but again that’s one of the things we’ll be starting to look at.

Respect – we haven’t really figured out what we mean by respect. We’ve had 
kind of amorphous stuff there. We’ll look at that a little bit more in a moment. 
The equanimious practice, when the moment was a little bit afraid – 
whenever there’s an emotion whether it’s positive or negative; just pause 
what you’re doing.  
 
 
Just pause the action for a moment and sit with it. Let it be. Sometimes it 
transforms and sometimes it doesn’t, but before you move on, before you 
ignore the emotional aspects, just hang around there for a while. Why do you 
think I need to say that?  
 
 
There are two reasons. When there is any kind of emotion, if you start sitting 
with it what are you practicing? You’re learning to handle emotions, especially 
the negative ones.  
 
 
What do we normally do when there’s a negative emotion? We try to get 
away from it. When the sumo comes after us, we run away; or when the 
people have a fight with us, we stand our ground and fight back.  
 
 
What we’re not doing is just being ourselves. In other words, we stop being 
the way we want to be at the point when the negative emotion comes in. So, 
if you’re having a negative emotion in the experience, hang around with it for 
a while. Be yourself despite it and you’re practicing a mental muscle – be it on 
a very small level – that in time will become a very powerful thing. 
 
 
Here’s another little secret to it. Did anyone here have a part of it which was 
slightly unpleasant, kind of like the slightly dodgy part of town or something 
like that? Do you want to talk about this? Bring you mic up here please. I’m 
sure this is something that’s easier to show than to talk about. 
 
Student: I was on a landscape on a field and suddenly the whole landscape dropped. 
 
Igor: 
The whole landscape dropped? 
 
Student: Except the spot where I was standing.  
 
Igor: 
What was the emotion that came with that or was that not the point yet? 
 
Student: Well, I had no real emotion and it happened and a bridge formed into the fog, 
and when I went into the fog I suddenly was walking over a lake and there 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

was some tribe from some ancient country I don’t know, with red faces 
staring at me, so I had no influence on the surroundings, so I couldn’t control 
the landscape dropping. 
 
Igor: 
Which is exactly what we want because it’s unexpected, but was it unpleasant 
in some way? 
 
Student: It was a bit scary. 
 
Igor: 
At which point did the scary bits start coming in? 
 
Student: Not controlling it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the bit when the thing dropped away. Okay, great. Do you want to play 
with this for a second? Hopefully this works out. If it doesn’t, that’s fine too. 
Just close your eyes for a moment; go back to that landscape, go back to the 
moment when the landscape just dropped away except for the bit in the 
ground. Do you still get a bit of that scary feeling? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. All I want you to do is just stay there and do nothing. Just be aware 
of that slightly scary feeling and aware of the slight dropping of the thing and 
just do your integrating breathing. Just hang out with it. Just sit with it. Don’t 
think about it. Don’t try to judge it or evaluate it. Just be with it and just talk 
us through what happens. 
 
Student: Well, it looks like I can now control the landscape. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s just pause here. Did you just notice what happened? Again, these are all 
very small increments because we’re only working at a very light level right 
now so that it’s safe.  
 
 
Let’s say we took the emotion that you had, the slight fear, and we scaled it 
up by say 100. That would be getting close to panic, terror or something like 
that, right? 
 
 
If he could hang out at that point and then have that sense of control again 
afterwards, kind of having gone through a similar cycle, what do you think 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
254 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that would do for him in terms of his personal empowerment? Would that be 
useful? Is that a useful reference experience? 
 
Student: Definitely, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see where we’re going with this? But there’s no point going straight to 
the big things if it’s going to terrorize you. You have to practice with Tyson’s 
little sister, and you have enough of a reference experience here now that 
you’re beginning to understand this is how it happens.  
 
 
 
Every single time a negative experience arises in these mentalizations, it’s an 
opportunity to practice that equanimity bit. Do you want to take another step 
with this just so we can see if we can work more with these five steps here? Is 
this useful to you guys? 
 
 
Go ahead and close your eyes. You’re there, the land has dropped away and 
you’re standing there. You’ve had the fear but you have more of a sense of 
control now, correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is there anything around you at the moment yet? Just talk me through it. 
 
Student: I can reverse the dropping. 
 
Igor: 
You can reverse the dropping. Excellent. So, you can move it up and down at 
will, correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
This is an odd way to do it because normally there’s another figure attached 
to it, but there’s some movement going on there, so let it drop up and down. 
This may be a tiny bit bizarre just because there’s an extra symbolic level, but 
hopefully you’ll go with this. 
 
 
I’d like for you to imagine the ground is in some way conscious and now it’s 
responding to your control efforts, and offer it a gift. What does it want? 
 
Student: I actually saw a gift like a Christmas present. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
255 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Close your eyes because we’re not finished yet. Put the Christmas 
package on there and now comes the big payoff. Ask for a gift in return. 
What’s that? 
 
Student: It’s offered me the bridge that I had earlier on. 
 
Igor: 
It offers you the bridge and how do you feel? 
 
Student: Excited. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you very much. Give him a round of applause for this. This 
seems like a relatively trivial event. If we just did it as a game, you wouldn’t 
think twice about it. Would that be fair to say? But again I want you to start 
paying attention to some symbolic landscape because we’ll be using this very 
small toolkit later on for very big things. 
 
 
Symbolically speaking, would you say in terms of the idea of respect, is there 
more or less respect going on now between him and his unconscious mind? 
How do we form friendships with people? There’s a give and take, isn’t there? 
There’s an exchange. 
 
 
If it’s one-sided as a friendship, is it really a friendship? Does anyone here 
know an acquaintance – we won’t call them friends – who just takes, takes, 
takes and never gives? Are they great friends? Are they great hanging around 
with? Have you got a deep and powerful bond? Do you know you can rely on 
them when you need them? 
 
 
We understand intuitively what the path to friendship is. It is you give and you 
take. They offer you something and you offer something in return. It’s not as 
clinical or business oriented, like buy this and you’ve got yours deserved and 
so on. You’re doing it out of a genuine spirit of friendship, so there’s that 
emotion that’s supplied as well. 
 
 
So, why not take that relationship building thing that we’ve spent our lives 
developing and apply it to yourself so that whilst you’re doing this practice 
which develops your concentration, your attention, your mindfulness and all 
these other things at the same time, it also helps you develop a relationship 
with your own unconscious on a symbolic level, which is of course the level 
that you’re working at? 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
256 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It’s a small step but it’s a step in the right direction. If we were doing this 
more one-to-one so that I could kind of show you more of what’s going on 
there, then you would very quickly see an exponential growth in the way the 
unconscious mind responds because it likes to be treated well.  
 
 
For some of us, it’s a novelty. Do you understand that when I say respect, 
we’re not just talking about benign attention, although that’s part of it? We 
can actually symbolically act out acts of respect. Does that make sense? 
 
 
Of course we see the equanimity there, and even though there were no actual 
figures there – there wasn’t an animal or a person to interact with – by 
assuming that motion has consciousness, which is one of the assumptions 
we’re going to start making with the unconscious, there’s an interaction with 
the unconscious as well, isn’t there? 
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? Now let’s just map out what 
happened here on a technical level, and let’s see if we can map it onto the 
experience we had earlier on from a dream that prevented an unpleasant 
recurring dream – we’ll call it a mild nightmare – from recurring.  
 
 
When Winfried had the sumo wrestler chasing him over and over and over 
again, think about the nature of the relationship that he had. Isn’t it very 
similar to this? The only thing he hadn’t done at that point was to demand a 
gift or an exchange of gifts. 
 
 
 
This is where it gets interesting. Once you get used to this point, your 
unconscious mind will start returning some of the stuff. You know how we 
talked about all the power that’s buried in the basement somewhere along 
with the stuff that terrifies you?  
 
 
If you start doing this at small scales, you start reclaiming bits of that and the 
more comfortable you get with that, the more your unconscious mind will say 
great, you can deal with more and that’s how you start reclaiming things. 
 
 
It’s like the person I told you about who has tripled his income, and another 
one whose business career is just going through the roof with the kind of 
people who are interested in his work now who two or three weeks ago 
weren’t even interested in talking to him.

Do you get the idea? Are you beginning to sense a bit of potential here? Are 
there any questions or comments on what we’ve covered so far? Okay, so 
now it’s time to practice. 
 
Flight Club Rules 
 
Igor: 
We have those five rules. Let me give you some actions that go with each rule 
just so you can start incorporating them into your practice. Is that okay with 
you? First of all, 
 
 The idea of discovering. 
 
 
Well, this is not an action. It’s a refrain of action. You can intend but don’t 
actually try to make something happen. Don’t force something to be there 
that’s not there and so on. 
 
 
In time we’ll show you how to call things or evoke things from the 
unconscious without interfering with it, but if you’re prone to interfering with 
it it’s best not to interfere. 
 
 In terms of movement, we’ve already talked about how moving 
through a landscape helps to stabilize it and allows more things to 
happen. 
 
 
In terms of interaction, here are a couple of basic rules that I want you to 
follow: 
 
1. If it moves, follow it. 
 
 
Isn’t that what happened here? There was a moving ground that was both the 
source of the mild fear and it was also the source of his sense of control 
afterwards.  
 
 
Would it be fair to say that they both match each other? In other words, you 
feel as much more in control now as you felt afraid before, roughly speaking. 
That tends to be the thing.  
 
 
In other words, the greater the terror is you’re willing to face, to sit with shall 
we say, the greater the reward will be afterwards, and fear is not the only 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
258 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
one. It’s sadness for some, fear for others, anger for someone else, and there 
will be a mixture in all of us of course as well. 
 
 
That’s the interaction. First of all, if it moves, follow it.  
 
2. If it moves, assume consciousness. 
 
 
It’s the unconscious mind in some way in action because you didn’t move the 
ground, did you? So, who did? Again do you notice how it’s very simple to 
wash over what these things can mean? If he didn’t consciously move the 
ground, who did? Hence, there’s something that you can interact with there. 
 
 
You can talk with it. That’s the simplest way. Some things won’t want to talk 
back with you. What if you have a figure that refuses to talk to you? What do 
you do then? Sit with it because that’s the bit at which I would get frustrated 
or I’m going to try to force the experience 
 
 
Instead of forcing the experience, the option is very simply if anything is going 
other than as you would wish it to, sit with it. Find out what is the real lesson? 
The lesson here was to have a sense of control, and you have more of a sense 
of that, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see where we’re going with this? In terms of the interaction element, 
you can talk with it, you can touch it or you can sit with it but if your attempts 
to interact with it start invading it – for example one of the trainees was in a 
river boat, he jumped in the river and some kids kind of held out a stick to 
kind of pull him out of the water, and every time he tried to grab the stick 
they pulled it away. 
 
 
So, at first he tried to force the experience. He tried to actually grab onto it. 
He’s starting to create a conflict – can you see that? – and of course they 
vanished, which made him feel very sad.  
 
 
Then we talked about this idea of interacting and not forcing the experience, 
and I think in the very next exercise he did he had something like a goat or a 
sheep or some four-legged animal which is furry and eats grass, and he had 
the same problem. It basically ignored him when he tried to interact with it. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
259 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, instead of forcing the interaction, he said okay good, this is a good place to 
be so I’ll sit with it – benign attention. He gave it benign attention and guess 
what happens next. The Billy goat approached him.  
 
 
I’ll have to listen to the tapes again to give you the exact version but the gift 
he got as a reward for waiting, for being patient, was an overwhelming sense 
of love. He actually had to pause for a while to integrate that, to sit with that 
emotion because he didn’t expect it. It came out of the blue for him. 
 
 
Do you see where we’re going with this? We have to stop and start a little bit 
here because we’re in a large group, so I can’t show you the continuity as 
easily, but I want you to have some appreciation of what we’re doing so that I 
can then let you go for a while and do several versions of this, growing at each 
step. Does that make sense? Is this useful? 
 
 
 
Do you understand what I mean by interacting? There are lots of different 
little things you can do with that. Are there any questions on that point?  
 
Student: It seems that a few people here have had some quite abstract visualizations, 
especially in this last round. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, they have. 
 
Student: Something I did myself – I don’t know if you’re familiar with Guillermo del 
Toro the sort of fantasy horror filmmaker.  
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: I had a lot of that kind of stuff going on in my head. It’s like there was a bit of 
fear intention there that I couldn’t really place on one particular thing. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. Then just sit with the emotion. Technically speaking, if it’s all kind 
of hazy, you have two options. One is to realize you probably haven’t 
stabilizing something enough. It’s kind of like the lady who was following the 
affect bridge everywhere. It’s just unstable, so you go back to some stabilizing 
practices. 
 
 
Remember, I promised you guys yesterday that whilst you’re working 
progressively, some of you may have to go back to some earlier lessons 
before you can move on a little bit further.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
260 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Some of you will have to go back to the mentalization stuff we did yesterday 
to become very comfortable with that practice so that when you start coming 
into more things like what we’re doing today, they start getting easier for you. 
They’re more stable for you again. I’m trying to contain it as much as possible 
in one seminar so that everyone finds a particular level within that. So, that’s 
one possibility. 
 
 
The other one is even in the absence of that, an emotion has still arisen. 
Where do emotions come from – the conscious mind or the unconscious? The 
unconscious, so you already have a chance to interact.  
 
 
Even if your landscape is unstable, you can still interact with the emotional 
aspect. It’s not necessarily as easy because you haven’t got a symbol like the 
ground coming up and down, like the sumo wrestler chasing you, like the 
people that started a confrontation with you.  
 
 
It’s a lot easier to work with symbols that way but in the absence of symbols, 
the emotions are still worth sitting with and a similar resolution can be 
obtained.  
 
 
Of course don’t get addicted to the idea that sitting with it creates a 
resolution because then that in itself creates interference and it’s no longer 
sitting with it. It’s no longer accepting it. It’s just pretending to accept it so it 
changes. Again it’s a very subtle nuance, isn’t it? Does that answer your 
question? 
 
Student: Yes. Thank you. 
 
Arthur: 
This is very similar to Dynamic Mental Imagery. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. In fact, I told some of the trainers during the break that you’ll see 
more and more correlations with doing the Dynamic Mental Imagery process 
and what we’re doing here.  
 
 
The main difference or distinction here is it’s very difficult to run the Dynamic 
Mental Imagery process on yourself. You need someone else to keep you 
stabilizing that part of reality until the meaningfulness of it pops through.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
261 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
We’re going to be doing that ourselves by first stabilizing the landscape and 
then learning to deal with that. It will become clearer as we go along, but DMI 
is the root through which this grew. 
 
Arthur: 
So, you can be pushing the person to try to have them come up with 
something. For example, I came up to a point where there were three forks 
you might say to take and I… 
 
Igor: 
Let’s just handle that, although it’s kind of a bit more abstract conversation 
for people who haven’t learned DMI, but very simply it’s this. When you’re 
doing a DMI induction process – you used the word pushing.  
 
 
I personally wouldn’t use that word because whilst you put pressure on the 
symbol, if you push too much you’ll actually create the Law of Reverse Effect. 
You’ll actually push them away from getting the resolution. 
 
 
The trick as in everything – it’s as true here as it is there – is how can you put 
pressure on something without forcing it?  
 
Student: You put pressure… 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Think about what happens when someone asks that question. Isn’t 
that focusing benign attention on it? What’s that over there? Oh, I see 
whatever it is. That’s wonderful. Do you know what it means? No. I wonder 
what it means. It must be something special. Oh yeah. 
 
 
These are all ways of putting benign attention on the symbol. You can do this 
yourself but because you don’t have a hypnotist redirecting you back to the 
symbol over and over again, you have to learn to do that yourself and that’s 
what the landscape is all about. That’s why we’ve spent so much time 
stabilizing the landscapes. Do you understand this? 
 
 
From time to time it will get amorphous, but then you just realize okay we’ll 
just go back to re-stabilizing. You can still work that, absolutely. That’s going 
into more classic mindfulness practice.  
 
 
In classic mindfulness practice, for example, people will do their meditation 
for a half an hour or whatever it is and suddenly an emotion will burst over 
them.

Let’s say it’s grief and they’ll cry and have no idea why they’re crying, or 
maybe they do have an idea why they’re crying because a memory has just 
popped up, and they’ll carry on doing their mindful breathing despite the 
emotional turmoil, at the end of which they come back saying this is the most 
amazing thing, I feel like a million dollars, because they’ve had the same kind 
of relief. 
 
 
The difference in mindfulness practice is there it happens spontaneously. 
Here, we’re learning to create a landscape so we get to choose what kind of 
experiences we will resolve and when – and it’s about resolution alone.  
 
 
For example, we’ll be able to do skill building and break through on skills that 
have eluded us for many years. It will be about generating ideas. There will be 
all kinds of different things that mindfulness does not allow you to do, at least 
not directly. Does that help? Hopefully that was useful. Are there any other 
comments or questions? 
 
Student: I was just curious. We use movement and description to stabilize an image. 
Would that also work in DMI? 
 
Igor: 
As a hypnotist, absolutely, but as a hypnotist you’re providing the language 
for that if you think about it. 
 
Student: Well, I just thought I’m not really looking forward to this exercise because I 
know regardless of what landscape I’m going to find, within minutes there’s 
always this huge black hole opening underneath me and sucking me in, and I 
was just thinking what could I do to move with it or to interact? What kind of 
interactions will I have? I have no choice. I’m just sucked in and I lose control, 
and I can’t talk to it.  
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here for a second. You’re in a great place. Are you 
willing to work with this? 
 
Student: I’m not sure. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the first question you have to ask yourself. Can you all hear in the 
quality of her voice the mental state that we’re talking about? This is the key 
right here. Is it okay with you if we use this? It’s obviously a very important 
thing to you.

So, the first thing is whatever emotion has come up, just sit with that for a 
moment. Remember the benign attention? Don’t try to make sense of it. 
Don’t try to make meaning out of it. Just let it sit and let it do its thing, which 
means initially it will probably intensify, if that’s okay with you.  
 
 
If it isn’t, let me know and you can make a choice not to go there yet but if it is 
okay with you, let it intensify for a moment. By resisting it, it’s being very 
persistent. Now I don’t know what this hole thing is about, but the first thing 
you can have a chat with your unconscious mind about – are you in a 
landscape there?  
 
 
Close your eyes this time. Can you see a landscape with that black hole and so 
on? Because we haven’t done the full mindfulness part of the training yet, 
what I’d like you to do just as a safety precaution is kind of interact with it like 
it’s a person and tell this little black hole thing that you’re about to let it do 
whatever it wants to do; however the deal it gets in return is it will only do it 
safely with you. 
 
 
If there’s more behind it, just only do a small amount just so you can learn 
from that. Go ahead and do that and let me know what happens.  
 
Student: It’s an agreement… 
 
Igor: 
It’s an agreement. 
 
 
Can you hear the change in her tone? Again the benign attention is starting to 
come back. Now that you’ve made an agreement, keep it. Let it suck you 
down. That’s it. Let the emotion come through because you’ll know whatever 
it is, you can tolerate it because that’s the agreement.  
 
 
It will be safe for you, so let it arise and as all emotions have a way of doing it 
will come in waves. It will get intensified and it will pass. It may even come 
back or it will come back with a lower intensity and that too will pass.  
 
 
Your job is to only sit there and witness it benignly, curiously, compassionate, 
kindly or whatever way you do it. You’re doing a good job of that now. There 
you go. There you go. You feel that, right?

When you feel it’s kind of complete, do not open your eyes, stay in the 
landscape but just let me know that it sort of has a sense of completion, but 
take your time for that.  
 
 
Do you see how quickly the unconscious mind can start taking advantage of 
the symbolic landscape you’re creating for it? In this case it seems that it was 
a very persistent message. There you go. How was that? Was that interesting? 
 
Student: You have to go at my pace. 
 
Igor: 
That’s just fine, but isn’t this starting to sound like a proper relationship now? 
This is important. The only reason for not going all the way through with it is 
because there’s a safety element involved. You need to make sure that you 
can get through with this in a safe sort of way. 
 
 
In this coaching environment, I can help you through that more, but you have 
to determine how much you’re ready to handle. Do you have a sense right 
now that your relationship with whatever that thing symbolizes is better or 
worse than before you did this little exercise? 
 
Student: Well, if they have an agreement, leaving each other alone, it’s okay. 
 
Igor: 
It’s okay, right? 
 
Student: Yes, it doesn’t want me if I don’t accept its speed, and I can’t accept the 
speed. 
 
Igor: 
So, he stopped bugging you. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Notice what happened. This is how you start working with your unconscious 
mind. At some point you realize you’re going to have to go through that at its 
own speed. You realize that, right?  
 
 
Well, let me take that back. You never have to do anything in your life you 
don’t want to. However, as terrifying as that black hole may seem to you right 
now, once you’ve let it do what it does, the transformation you’ll receive from 
it will be equally intense.

The payback you get will be equally large, but I understand that right now you 
may not feel ready to handle something like that, and that’s why we’re doing 
this work. You, I think more than everyone else in this room right now, 
appreciate the importance of the mindfulness part now, right? 
 
Student: Certainly. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Honestly it doesn’t matter to me what you choose, but if you at some 
point decide to choose to go through that and get the payoff that you will get 
as a result of that, of course I think you’ll be very happy with the results of it. 
 
 
What you need to do between now and then – if there is going to be a then – 
is develop the skills so that you can do that at a pace that is safe for you. If 
safe for you means it’s got to go at that particular speed, that probably means 
you’ve got to do some kind of mindfulness training, so you can go there with 
equanimity.  
 
 
One of the exercises we’ll do tomorrow on equanimity will help you a huge 
amount, and of course you want to practice lots of other little things. 
Sebastian’s thing was a very small thing, which is a lot easier to handle, and 
the more of those you have the more trust and faith you’ll have that you can 
make it through. 
 
 
That’s why we’re doing this. We’ve gone to two opposite extremes now. 
We’ve gone from very small but handle-able – and you got a little bit of value 
out of this but it’s not going to change your life in a massive way – and we’ve 
gone to something that’s obviously very large and will have a huge payoff but 
you’re not quite ready to handle yet. 
 
 
So, instead of ignoring it, rejecting it, adding more fear into it by adding your 
actual fear into it, you have instead an agreement. Isn’t that progress? Isn’t 
that better? How do you feel about that? 
 
Student: Having the agreement to leave it for now and it’s okay, but for the whole of 
my life I’ve known about this hole, and for the whole of my life I’ve known 
that one day I could go there. 
 
Igor: 
And now you’re building the skills to actually be able to go there but knowing 
the intensity of what you’ll have to go through, you’ve got some work ahead 
of you, don’t you?

Student: Definitely. 
 
Igor: 
Whilst we still have more stuff to build, just based on the experience you’ve 
had here so far, do you think you have a decent idea of what kind of work to 
do that eventually will let you go through that hole safely? 
 
Student: I suppose so, yes. 
 
Igor: 
We’ll add more but remember it’s kind of like the weight lifting example. If 
the weight you have to lift is very heavy, you have to spend a little bit longer 
preparing yourself for it. Thank you for that. I appreciate you bringing it up. 
Give her a round of applause. Did you have a follow-up? 
 
Student: Yes. I feel a bit left out I have to say, because I just can’t create or discover 
landscapes, so everybody’s having scary or beautiful experiences and I just 
see nothing. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. That’s because you’ve jumped in the deep end. Remember, we 
gave you two choices?  
 
Student: Actually I didn’t say anything. I didn’t vote. 
 
Igor: 
That’s what happens when you don’t vote. Rest assured before the end of 
today, I will give you easier ways to develop those landscapes. They’re not as 
dramatic as this but they will ease you into it more gently.  
 
 
We’re going to go from the bigger pictures downward for a bit, so you may be 
a bit lost for a little while but when we get towards the end you’ll know how 
to build back up the other way. Whilst they make less sense to you now, 
they’ll make more sense to you later.  
 
 
You’re welcome just to do your mindful breathing instead. It’s not you’re 
wasting time. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.

Student: I had a sneaking suspicion that I would be dithering if I didn’t get some help, 
so I asked the partner that I had yesterday if he would listen to me to force 
things to give me some pressure.  
 
 
So, I started out with a mountain and it was off in the distance and it was like 
okay I have to go there. I have pressure. I didn’t want to bore him with this 
walk, so I just zoomed to the mountain. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I got there and I’m looking at it and it was really steep, and I went okay I guess 
I’ll climb it, and I got to the top and went I don’t want to do this. I looked up 
and I thought I can jump that far and then I went no, I can’t. 
 
 
Then the other part of me that suggested it went yeah, you can and I didn’t 
want to bolt; I’m like I’m going to jump? Then I did and I’m like okay that’s 
new. So, having the pressure of somebody listening to me forced me to come 
up with some ways to travel. 
 
Igor: 
There are a couple of things – if you don’t me kind of playing with that. First of 
all, do you once again notice the nature of the conscious-unconscious 
interaction going on there? This time the unconscious mind was the coach – 
yes, you can do it. No, I can’t. Yes, you can. 
 
 
Secondly, notice what we talked about yesterday, when you describe a scene 
to an actual person more of your neurology lights up than if you describe it 
internally. Describing it internally more neurology lights up than if you don’t 
use any description whatsoever. 
 
 
So, that might be something you want to try as well, which is actually to work 
with a person for that. It won’t guarantee the result but that’s okay because 
part of what you need to learn is how to stop blocking the interaction.  
 
 
Let’s face it. You dream and you don’t sit there and script your dreams out 
every night beforehand and say maybe I’ll watch a movie and just steal some 
plot lines from it. You just dream it and it just happens, and they’re all pretty 
bizarre usually, aren’t they? 
 
 
So, you’re capable of it. In other words, you’re doing something extra that 
prevents it. There are secret entrances that will get you there anyway, which 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
268 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
we’ll cover later on today, but in the meantime something like that can work 
great for you – and also for you by the way. Did you listen to the voice? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
And did you get a payoff? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Was it emotional? 
 
Student: I’m pretty happy about it, so yes. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Again by trusting the unconscious, a little portion of yourself is 
reclaimed and the emotion that’s usually the way that you can tell. It’s not 
always the emotion. Sometimes it’s an insight. Sometimes a problem in your 
life resolves itself without knowing. 
 
 
I’ll give you quick example of this if I may. One of the people I did this with – 
this is a process we’ll come onto in a couple of days’ time.  We’ll use these 
things for an emotional healing.  
 
 
So, he did this not thinking very much of it and he started to heal an old 
relationship issue just because he was going to get around to it eventually 
anyways. This thing moved him so profoundly that first of all he refused to tell 
me what it was, which I’m fine with of course. 
 
 
Then shortly afterwards he emailed me back saying that the strangest things 
had happened since he resolved this particular issue. Not only does he feel 
lighter, better and happier and all of that sort of stuff, but within 24 hours or 
so a mole that was growing on his back fell off. He just woke up one morning 
and it fell off.  
 
 
I can’t of course say it’s a complete correlation or a causality shall we say. We 
need a lot more instances before we can say that, but anecdotally it’s still 
pretty persuasive, isn’t it? Notice how bit by bit in all of you guys little bits are 
beginning to happen. We’re getting to somewhere much more profound than 
we did yesterday.

As a group, is that relatively accurate? As an individual, you may not be there 
yet and that’s fine. As we said yesterday, we need to do some training cycles, 
some building up.  
 
 
Some of you will spend longer on the first level. Some of you will spend longer 
on this level. Some of you will spend longer on the next level before you can 
do the other things, and that’s fine. You have the rest of your life to go and 
find out who you are. Make sense? Thank you for sharing that. Are there any 
other comments or questions? 
 
Student: At first I got caught up in this benign attention thing and I found that for me it 
was much better if I call it benign intention or benignly being with it. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. 
 
Student: Don’t lead me. Don’t follow. Just stay beside me. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. I think you just put your finger right on the heart of it again, which is 
we do not have an adequate vocabulary for what we’re doing here. It’s 
inadequate. My best attempt at it is to shape experiences for you from which 
you can learn, and you can call it whatever you wish.  
 
 
The important thing for me is that you get the essence of the lessons, and 
benignly being with something is fantastic. Usually I would just call it sit with 
it, but that means a lot of things to me and I can describe that to a client and 
help them get the nuance right. Use whatever terminology works best for 
you. 
 
 
The important bit is there’s that overall sense of benevolence, positiveness, 
kindness and so on and you have no attempt to force any change on the item. 
It does it by itself. Make sense?  
 
 
I think we’ve talked enough for now. It’s time to do some more experiencing. 
We’ve talked about discovering. We’ve talked about movement. We’ve talked 
about interaction and the whole idea of sitting with it. 
 
 
Let’s talk a little bit about: 
 
 Respect. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
270 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Relationships are based on respect, aren’t they? Once again if we turn back 
on ourselves and we assume our unconscious mind – which by the way is just 
another symbol – is a relationship that we have, then it’s a relationship that 
for many of us is not really based on respect. 
 
 
As I say, I’ve treated myself far, far worse than people I don’t even like. I 
thought I liked myself. What do we do when we treat people with respect? 
Well, we usually greet them and when we’re done we usually say a kind of 
farewell. It’s kind of an entry and exit ritual. 
 
 
So, if you’re going to interact with some figures, why not go with what you’ve 
done your whole life – greet them and when you’re finished say thanks and 
goodbye? It’s just common courtesy, isn’t it? Or nowadays maybe uncommon 
courtesy. 
 
 
The next thing is of course: 
 
 Be polite. 
 
 
Treat your internal symbology as something real and it becomes more real. 
This is where you get into interesting territory. What if you don’t like what 
you see? Should you reject it? Should you just curse at it? Should you kick it in 
the ass and tell it to get away? 
 
 
That doesn’t really do very much for your relationship, does it? Remember, 
what you’re angry with is you, so why on Earth would you treat it 
disrespectfully, even something as intense as that black hole? It’s still you, and 
that’s the word right there – unfortunately. Do you see how easily you fall 
into that?  
 
 
Now I’m not going to tell you how you create the relationship inside yourself, 
but every time we put a little negative connotation to that, whatever that is 
gets worse because it gets added to it. Do you want that?  
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
Do you mind trying something? It’s just an experiment. You have your 
agreement, so you don’t have to go down that route yet, but could you call up 
that black hole that you had the agreement with for a moment and just try 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
271 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
something really unusual? Apologize sincerely for your parts of the 
interaction. What happens? Is it okay to talk about this? 
 
Student: Yes. Well, it’s laughing. It doesn’t accept my apology. 
 
Igor: 
Would you if someone has been mistreating you for most of your life? This is 
the point. This is very important. Again remember the guy I told you about 
who transformed?  
 
 
The same thing happened as well. He had a symbol that wanted him to fail 
and when he tried to create a positive interaction, its first response was screw 
you buddy. You’re getting right back what you’ve given to it but that’s okay 
because you’re only at the first step. In two days’ time, we’ll show you 
something that will help a lot with this part of the process as well. 
 
 
Notice how even the fact that you’re willing to do it – it’s laughing at you, 
right?  
 
Student: Yes, it’s laughing at the attempt. It’s not that it isn’t listening. It’s also making 
fun of it. It’s ridiculing it. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, which is actually great. 
 
Student: No! 
 
Igor: 
It doesn’t seem that great because you’re at the butt end of it this time. 
 
Student: It makes me angry. 
 
Igor: 
Now that’s the bit that you need to be benign about. Do you see how there’s 
a vicious cycle going on? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
When you get that, instead of engaging with the anger just sit with that. Just 
stick with the anger. Not with it, but stick with your anger. Just pay attention 
to it benignly. 
 
 
Think of it this way. Think of yourself as a kind parent looking on a willful child 
being angry at something really petty.

Student: Well, my children are sitting next to me, both of them. 
 
Igor: 
Which is wonderful, but does that change the experience for you? 
 
Student: Yes, I think it does. 
 
Igor: 
The anger can still be there. That’s just fine for it to be there. Are you 
beginning to see the importance of the mindfulness now? It is the thing that 
prevents you from being sucked into the trap of making things worse.  
 
 
We haven’t made things better yet, I know, but the first step to making things 
better is to stop making it worse. In other words, we’re stabilizing it and then 
it will be easier to get back into it. Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
 
Of course this is a more complex thing. This is something that you’ve built up 
your whole life to get towards, so it’s going to take a little bit of effort to get 
through as well. The question is are you willing to do it and are you willing at 
least to stabilize things so that things don’t get worse? 
 
Student: It’s fine looking at me now. I don’t have any anger or anything at all. I’m just 
relaxed, looking at... 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. How do you get there? It’s because instead of engaging with the 
anger – identifying with it – you had benign attention and said okay. There’s 
anger there. What did the anger do? It disappeared again. 
 
Student: The hole stopped laughing at me. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, a relationship is a two-way street. You react, it reacts back, you 
react back and so on. You didn’t react back. You just broke part of the cycle. 
Have you changed it yet? No, but you’ve stopped making it worse and that’s 
really crucial. I hope you really appreciate how important that part of it is. 
 
Student: I do, yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s coming back to what Sebastian said about control. That’s the real 
control that you have. The control you have with your unconscious mind is to 
stop making things worse, and then you start getting to the point where you 
can start making things right bit by bit.

Has this been useful to you guys? I want to thank your unconscious mind for 
being so unpleasant to you. I hope you appreciate the benigness of that 
statement. 
 
Student: I certainly do. 
 
Igor: 
Good. When you guys go home you can say, there we were and Igor said I’m 
so glad your unconscious mind was unpleasant to you. What? What kind of a 
trainer is that? Thank you for playing along. I appreciate that. Did you all learn 
something from this? [Applause] 
 
Student: So, what you really sit with is not a situation but you’re looking to sit with 
emotion? 
 
Igor: 
The emotion is your trigger point. It shows you that this is something to sit 
with, and typically it’s an emotion that includes some form of aversion. The 
aversion that we have here is either the anger or I don’t want to make friends 
with it or I want it to go away. 
 
 
All these things are signs of resistance, which is one of the reasons it persists 
because you’re fueling the dynamic. You’re giving it more meaning by making 
it more real.  
 
 
Something that starts off as a very small problem can grow and grow and 
grow into a very large problem because you’re compounding that error and 
you’re worsening the relationship by being more and more unpleasant 
towards yourself or that part or that aspect of yourself. 
 
Student: Right, so when you get to the point, like the point I went through where it 
says interact, you’re interacting with something or someone, so there’s a 
situation and when the emotion comes up you’re not sitting actually with the 
situation or with someone, but you’re sitting with the emotion. 
 
Igor: 
You’re sitting with all it. All that emotion does is it sucks you into it to want to 
have a fight. It’s kind of like the example we had here where the people came 
up and started getting angry with him for tailgating. Then he starts standing 
his ground. Now you have an interaction. It’s just not a positive one. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
274 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The emotion is what sucked him in. Would that be fair to say? If you had felt 
like oh this is great, my unconscious mind is working with me, look it’s still 
working with me, would the whole scenario have worked anywhere near the 
same way? No. 
 
 
Yes, you’re sitting with the emotion but you’re also sitting with the situation 
and you’re also sitting with the symbol because guess what? They’re all the 
same thing.  
 
Student: Well, I’m still not clear between the sitting with it and moving or interacting 
with it. I’m sorry to use this example, but here you said okay don’t sit with 
that, sit with emotion and then interact… 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I didn’t say don’t sit with that. The thing that came up was the emotion of 
anger, and that bit is what’s going to create the next cycle of the interaction. 
So, to break the negative cycle interaction, she needs to deal with her own 
anger first.  
 
 
Once that’s disappeared, then you can get back to being with or sitting with 
or being kind to whatever – in this case it’s the black hole experience. In fact, 
she already did that. She already said I don’t feel angry now and in fact the 
black hole’s gone away.  
 
 
It shut its mouth, which is a difference. It’s a change in terms of the way that 
she would normally interact with it, and that’s the thing we’re looking for. 
We’ve now made a small positive change and the positive change is it’s no 
longer getting worse, but she couldn’t make the positive change if she was 
absorbed by her own emotions. 
 
Student: She’s interacting. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, but the emotion – for example the anger – was a second step 
removed from the actual hole. This is how relationships complicate 
themselves.  
 
 
In Sebastian’s case, the emotion of fear of being out of control was a very 
direct relationship to the ground moving. So, by paying attention to the 
ground, he was also paying attention to his fear. They’re both that 
interrelated.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
275 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It’s just that this is more complex. There are extra emotions because there’s 
the anger towards the response, then there’s the response and that’s what 
the whole black hole thing may mean symbolically and all the things behind 
that.  
 
 
There’s a maelstrom of emotions. I’m just helping her to separate what’s the 
easiest one to not get absorbed by – which was the anger. Once that’s dealt 
with, now we can go to the next one, which is the black hole sort of thing 
shutting its mouth.  
 
 
Eventually she’ll get to the point where the black hole can be there abusing 
her and she’ll say that’s okay. By the way, when you get to that point, that will 
be the one step before – going through it will be easy. You realize that, right? 
 
Student: Yep. 
 
Igor: 
See what I mean? Can you see the congruency in the way she said yep? It’s 
just going to take some effort to get there because she has a lifetime of 
experiencing not doing that. When you find your own black hole, you’ll 
understand this much more easily. 
 
Student: So, you say I’ve had one? 
 
Igor: 
I wish I could say no, but if you didn’t you’d be the Buddha. Do you want to 
come up here and teach the rest? Thank you. All right, so you get the idea of 
respect. Do you see how important this little thing is? I apologize for taking so 
much time with it but it’s very important, especially when these emotions 
come up because that’s when it’s so tempting not to do this, but that’s where 
the greatest healing and the greatest transformation will come. 
 
 
It’s where the greatest power that you’ve lost will be reclaimed. By power, I 
mean personal power, charisma, ability to influence others, ability to do 
certain tasks or skills that you haven’t been doing before, the ability to 
overcome fears so that you can be the greater you, the person you always 
knew you could be. 
 
 
 
That’s what I mean. I’m not talking about being one with the universe and 
then life still sucks. This will concretely, practically change the life you live on 
a day-by-day basis, but it requires skill and that’s something you have to learn. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
276 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 The other part of the idea of respect is the exchange of gifts. 
 
 
 
We talked about it here a little bit. For example, the more useful one is 
actually to talk about Winfried’s version of the sumo wrestler confronting 
him. Once the interaction has changed – in other words why are you chasing 
me? Oh, because you’re running away. Great, I’m not running anymore, so I 
guess you owe me a gift. 
 
 
Then in exchanging the gift, it cements the relationship but it also reclaims 
some power. Allow me to give you an example. This is actually from dream 
work, which is very related to what we’re doing here, which will hopefully 
clarify this. 
 
 
I can’t remember if it was a man or a woman now, but a patient comes in 
who’s got repeating nightmares, the classic chase nightmare where 
someone’s chasing them, some monster. It’s nebulous and they don’t know 
what it is. It’s just they feel terror and they run and it happens night after 
night after night, and they can’t get a night’s sleep. 
 
 
Of course eventually they come to a therapist. The instructions are very 
simple. The next time it happens, instead of running from it, turn around and 
catch the monster that’s chasing you. Oh, I don’t know if I can do that.  
 
 
Eventually he persuades her that she can do that – I think it was a woman. So, 
the next recurring nightmare occurs and she remembers inside the dream 
vaguely the words that they agreed on. So, she turns around and runs 
towards whatever is chasing her and she’s terrified still.  
 
 
When it gets there, it’s some crazy beast that’s just terrifying to her and she 
hugs it. As she’s hugging it, it transforms. It becomes the symbol or the image 
of her dead father and the message that came back was something along the 
lines of I just came to tell you I love you. 
 
 
Can you see in that little symbolic transaction how people lose their power? 
The running away portion is kind of like people running away from grief and 
fear and so on, and behind that is all the positive aspects of the relationship 
they’re losing by not dealing with the grief of the relationship that they’re 
running away from, symbolically speaking.

That’s a very complex psychodynamic theory. The actual event is it’s chasing 
you, catch it and then demand a gift. The gift is the father telling her I love 
you. Do you see where we’re going with this?  
 
 
Have I given you enough metaphors to understand what I mean by the idea of 
respect and the exchanging of gifts? Sometimes it’s more mundane – you just 
give it a little present. Other times it will be more profound but if you do this 
routinely, the more profound versions will come more often. Does that make 
sense to you? 
 
 
The next step is: 
 
 Equanimity. 
 
 
I think this is a great example of it right here. Notice how she was getting 
sucked into that emotion – in other words she was losing her equanimity – 
things got worse.  
 
 
When you find your way back to balance, even though sometimes it’s a 
struggle, I realize, things started getting better or at the very least they 
stopped getting worse enough that you can do something about it.  
 
 
It actually got better because things never stay the same. They get better or 
they get worse. That’s really the only choices you have, so they’re not getting 
worse. They may not feel like they’re getting better but they have to be.  
 
 
It’s kind of like in your life you’re either moving forwards or you’re going back. 
There’s no standing still because the rest of the world will continue on. 
Enough of me talking. It’s time for you to do some action. 
 
The Rules In Action 
 
Igor: 
Again if you want to use a partner, by all means do so but if you want to do it 
on your own do that again. Start again with a simple kind of mindful 
movement and again find a new landscape, this time with these five rules in 
mind.

Rules Of Flight Club: 
 
1. Discover 
2. Move 
3. Interact 
4. Respect 
5. Equanimity 
 
 
You may have a landscape where you can’t do much interaction but the 
interaction part is always to do with follow the movement. If it moves, 
interact with it.  
 
 
On occasion there will be things that aren’t moving but you have a knowing 
sort of sense of like there’s something here, which is fine, but for the most 
part if it moves it’s worth interacting with. If you have more than one thing 
moving, then you get to pick.  
 
 
Do you understand the nature of the exercise? All you’re going to do is 
practice these five rules with something in your inner landscape in a small 
way or a large way, whatever you want to deal with, which means you’re 
going to do your mindful movement. 
 
 
I’m in an icy desert, so it’s like Antarctic or something. It’s just snow and ice 
everywhere. It’s just going down. Oh, and we have a Yeti. It’s actually the 
plants versus zombie Yeti. It’s got a little hat on with the flowers, which is very 
nice.  
 
 
So, it’s trying to kind of grab me and my instinct is to move away, which is why 
I won’t. I’m going to step into it. Okay, I feel a little pressure here. It’s a very 
small amount of panic. It’s very, very light.  
 
 
So, it had this sort of kind of grizzly mouth with kind of rotten teeth. The 
mouth actually seemed much friendlier. It’s actually almost like a little gawky 
figure, kind of a fun figure. 
 
 
So, now we’ve done this part. I’m going to say okay, can you please give me a 
gift? So, it gives me like an old phonograph and it plays nice music. It’s 
actually quite pleasant.

So, now it’s my turn. Was there anything you want? All right, why not? It 
wants balloon animals, so I’m going to make him a balloon animal. Here you 
go. Done. 
 
 
It wasn’t massively profound. However, the relationship is the bit that I’m 
interested in. Did I discover something? Yes. Did I move within the scene? Yes. 
Did I interact with it? Yes. Did I treat it respectfully? Yes, and including the 
exchange of gifts there. Was I equanimous – in other words was the 
interaction overall with a benign intention/attention or whatever? Yes. 
 
 
Do you get the nature of the exercise? It can be as fast as that. It can be 
longer. It can be shorter. Who knows? Just enjoy it. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m on some kind of field, looks like wheat. There are rows of wheat. There 
are tractor tracks in the field. There is something to the right that is pleasant 
and something to the left that isn’t that pleasant.  
 
 
I’ll stay with that. Yeah, I’ll turn around and look to the left. There’s a globe 
with long colors like a kaleidoscope and it’s taking over the whole landscape, 
which I think is fine for the moment. 
 
 
We’re going to try and walk around it. There doesn’t seem to be a back side of 
it. There’s a door. Not a door. It’s completely black, a rectangle, and when I 
look into that black rectangle there’s absolutely nothing there except a lit 
match. 
 
 
I wonder how I can interact with a lit match. I wonder what I could give the lit 
match with the red bright lights.  
 
Student: Ask it. 
 
Student: It says what haven’t you given me? 
 
Student: Is the match for you? 
 
Student: It’s changing now. It’s more intense. It’s more like a close-up of the sun. 
There’s a lot of heat coming out from it and there is some fear attached to 
that image.

Student: Sit with that. 
 
Student: I guess I’ve already given it everything. I guess it’s time for that to give me 
something. Oh, a green cube. There’s something red trying to come out of the 
green cube. It’s a tongue like from a cartoon, a red tongue.  
 
 
The cube is transforming into some kind of cartoon character. It hasn’t 
opened its eyes yet. It’s smiling. Oh, it got ears suddenly and eyebrows. Oh, 
and black hair. 
 
Student: Just take that with you and take a breath. 
 
Igor: 
All right, folks. Welcome back. Was that interesting? Who’s noticing that more 
or stranger or more profound stuff is starting to happen now as you’re 
progressing, as you’re starting to learn to navigate that? Tell me a little bit 
about what’s going on. Just tell me a little bit about what happened. 
 
Student: This is the first time in this exercise that I’ve actually discovered something. I 
appeared to be walking on some sort of lunar landscape and I was passing a 
rock and this little green creature came out with what looked like a nose in 
the shape of a bugle, and he kept poking his nose at me.  
 
 
So, I just instinctively grabbed his nose to shake hands, and I found my hand 
cemented to his nose. Then he started backing away from me and was pulling 
me in a pulling motion as though he wanted me to go with him.  
 
 
So, I went with that and we went to a cave. When we went into the cave, 
there were four little miniature models of this person, animal or whatever it 
was, but they were blue – his children perhaps. 
 
 
He beckoned me to sit down and I sat down, and then a red version of this 
person or this animal or this creature came in pushing a trolley with a full 
silver service on it for cups of tea and coffee with strawberries and scones. 
 
 
So, we sat and we partook of these things and then after a while they all 
stood up, all together, which indicated it was time for me to leave. That’s 
what I took it to be. So, I backed out. I walked out of the cave and I walked 
back to what appeared to be a spaceship and climbed the ladder, and then 
that was it.

Igor: 
It’s amazing, isn’t it? Does this sound like a dream? Does someone normally 
talk about this? This sounds like a dream, doesn’t it? People don’t normally 
fantasize in this way. This is pure unconscious content coming out. 
 
 
Overall what would the emotional tone of this experience have been for you? 
What would you say that was? Did your emotions kind of go on any kind of 
experience there? 
 
Student: It was a happy experience. 
 
Igor: 
It was a happy experience, which is as it should be when you make friends 
with your unconscious mind. Again notice we haven’t done anything 
massively therapeutic or skill change and so on. 
 
 
What he’s doing, however, is building a relationship with the unconscious 
mind. There’s wonderful symbolism there – the idea of following where 
they’re leading. They’re sharing a meal – that’s the sharing of gifts in some 
respects and so on. 
 
 
This is the important thing. The skills you’re building right now are the ones 
that can be turned into actual practical valuable things. You realize right now 
we’re not yet at a practical stage, right?  
 
 
Has anyone here actually received some kind of practical benefit – in other 
words they released something or something like that? We’ll talk about that 
in a moment, but that is not the point of this exercise.  
 
 
These are still training wheels, and the skills you’re learning here will be of 
great value to you in a couple of days’ time when we start turning this 
towards a practical purpose. I hope you can separate the two. 
 
 
Even though you may be getting some value out of it now, you’re still doing 
training. The actual application of it – which comes towards the end of it – will 
rest on the ability to do this stuff first, and that is a wonderful classic thing. 
You had no idea that that was going to happen did you? 
 
Student: No, I had no idea and I’m curious as to why I would suddenly conjure up 
something so strange.

Igor: 
Well, let’s put it this way. For starters is there any doubt in your mind that 
your unconscious mind was involved in that? 
 
Student: Absolutely not. 
 
Igor: 
That’s quite useful, isn’t it? If you’re going to establish a relationship with 
someone, knowing that it’s real helps, doesn’t it? There may well be all kinds 
of other symbolism there that you’ll understand better than me but that’s all 
that matters here. 
 
 
Right now remember all we were doing is those five simple steps and at least 
four of them – actually the equanimity bit also. Even though it was a little 
strange, you still went with it without being disturbed by it, so I guess you did 
that too. 
 
 
Can you hear all five of those steps in that little interaction that he had there? 
That’s all we want to do here. If you happen to get some therapeutic benefit, 
if you happen to come up with an idea, some creative benefit, if something 
else comes out of it that’s fantastic. Well done. That’s a bonus. 
 
 
But we’re not there yet on a specific purpose. We’re still building skills to 
allow us to do that. Does that make sense to you? Thank you for that. I 
appreciate that. That’s a wonderful thing. Give him a round of applause. 
 
Student: I found mine to be interesting and at moments I wondered if I was making it 
up so to speak, but when I began I started sort of soaring and I thought oh, 
let’s just go with this. 
 
 
So, as I continued I went upward motion and then it sort of opened up to like 
a bright sky sort of, and then what seemed at first like a bird kind of big came 
and hit me and I thought wait, be gentle with or don’t harm me. It was an 
agreement. So, once I said that it turned into my mother, who passed away, 
and then… 
 
Igor: 
I think we kind of get the picture at this point.  
 
Student: She held my hand and we started flying together. Then at some point when I 
said the gift, she gave me what was a Christmas ball that I actually have in my 
house and I thought this?

283 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Then she said that’s because if you hold it then you won’t have to hold onto 
my hand. Then when I held it and she sort of waved, it turned into a balloon 
and it sort of assisted me down. Then she said that’s from me to be gentle 
with myself.  
 
 
Then also as she was going away, I thought remember something that I felt 
guilty about because she wanted to go to Israel and I never went with her, so 
she never got to go.  
 
 
So, I went to apologize and she said I’m okay. So, then I kind of came down 
slowly and gently and then as I kind of ran to get my grip, I sort of reminded 
myself to be gentle. That’s pretty much it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful. Wow. Awesome. This is almost a rhetorical question at this 
point, but are you glad you had that experience? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Was it of value to you? 
 
Student: In many ways. 
 
Igor: 
In many ways, right? You can feel the emotion coming off here, right? Do you 
see how this experience epitomizes the kind of stuff that we’re trying to do 
here?  
 
 
All that you had to do is create a landscape that was stable enough and not 
force things to be there so that your unconscious mind could create things. 
What I particularly liked again is notice the way the symbolism works.  
 
 
At first the unconscious mind usually gives you a little hesitant opening. That’s 
the bird kind of hitting you in the face, which is like what the hell are you 
doing with this?  
 
 
 
It’s kind of like a test. If you react to it well, that’s when other things happen. 
So, that’s when it transformed and of course you had what sounded like a 
very healing or therapeutic moment with your mother, which released other 
things from your past.

If this had happened inside of a hypnotherapy session, wouldn’t you have said 
oh that’s a good bit of therapy right there? She did it all by herself, no need 
for anything. She didn’t have to guide it. She didn’t have to construct it. She 
didn’t have to force it.  
 
 
You didn’t decide it was going to happen ahead of time. It just came for you, 
and that’s the value of what we’re doing here. Are you beginning to 
understand the importance of these five rules?  
 
 
There are a couple more that we’ll play with in a moment. You can see the 
potential of the stuff that you’re doing here, even though we’re still 
technically doing training wheels here. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: One of the things that I discovered as I landed was that – I don’t know if I 
struggled but I beat up on myself quite a bit about weight because I’ll go from 
one extreme to the other. I’ll do well and then do… and one of the things that 
I reminded myself of was that it would be much more effortless if I were 
gentle with myself. 
 
Igor: 
Which again this is a great lesson. Do you see how we get to learn from our 
unconscious? Thank you very much. Give her a round of applause for that. 
That’s fantastic.  
 
 
Now let’s see if we can use that to address what we had over here 
somewhere yesterday, the idea of the difference between a self-delusion and 
a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is one of the ways you can convert one to the 
other. 
 
 
What is a self-delusion? I will force myself to lose weight. There’s a great 
quote in one of the books, which is basically the solution is the problem. It’s 
people’s attempt to resolve a particular issue or problem that’s maintaining it. 
This is a classic example of it. 
 
 
Could she get that kind of insight on her own? Maybe or maybe not, but isn’t 
this a much easier and actually a much more emotionally pleasant way of 
doing it? Do you see the potential within what you’re learning to do here? I 
appreciate that. Thank you. 
 
 
Before we go onto other things, I noticed we’ve been doing this for a while 
now. Can we just pause here for a bit, have a quick break and then come back

and then discuss it again? Please keep these ideas fresh in your mind because 
we will address it again, all right?

DVD 8 – How To Create Vivid Landscapes With 
Remembered Journeys & Unconscious 
Symbols 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
We had a bit of an interesting moment in the last session, so I’m guessing that 
a few of you still have some comments to make. 
 
Student: I have a question. The imagery I got, I expected I would feel some kind of 
emotion but nothing really happened. To explain a little bit, it was like a snake 
or some snake kind of thing crawling up my arm and then basically eating my 
heart. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. I love it. 
 
Student: It was fine with me. It transformed and everything but I didn’t really feel 
anything connected to it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. First of all, you felt somewhat of a transforming moment or some 
change occurring there.  
 
Student: There was change occurring but I didn’t feel it. I just noticed it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s good. A couple of things – first of all let’s not get addicted to how a 
change should occur as long as it occurs. Just let it happen. Allow me to ask 
you this. How emotional a person are you normally? 
 
Student: Not very but I have my emotional moments. 
 
Igor: 
Of course. Everyone does. The reason I’m asking this is because – do you 
remember one of the beta testers that did this whose specific purpose for 
learning the program was he was having a child and he wanted to become 
more emotional so he could be a more emotional positive father?

He’s a wonderful person, very positive, a great person to hang out with, 
friendly, chatty and all that sort of stuff but he’ll be the first to say that he’s 
not got as deep and emotional experiences as he would like. That all changed 
in one of the exercises we’ll be showing you in a couple days’ time, and it was 
a very big thing. 
 
 
It was something in similar scope to the kind of black cycling thing. I’m just 
using it because it’s a reference experience people can share in. It was not an 
easy transition for him to make. It’s a transition he wanted to make, and it’s a 
transition he was very glad to make and it’s a transition he was very good at 
avoiding even in the symbolic landscape. 
 
 
Once it pointed out where the avoiding was happening, he went oh, and 
that’s when the whole transformation came. I suspect that’s going on here. 
On things that are already in some respects safe or you’re accustomed to, 
you’ll get a lot of transformation within that, but that will be mostly within 
Bucket Land. 
 
 
The big change that will happen for you – much as the other thing happened 
for him – will come with certain fireworks, which will be unmistakable and I 
suspect you’re not quite ready for them yet because we still have some tools 
to build up. 
 
 
I’m not saying this to be glib. It’s just that you remind me very much of the 
similar circumstances, so take what you can get for now because when the 
fireworks come, you won’t have a chance to think about it much more. 
 
Student: All right. Thanks. 
 
Student: I seem to have started off like the hare and the tortoise. In the first few days, I 
seemed to be ahead of the game. Well, I’m the tortoise now because I’m no 
longer ahead of the game. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I found nothing. All I had was blackness, darkness, nothing and then I had a 
flash of a yak – no, the one from South America but I’ve forgotten the name.  
 
Igor: 
Alpaca?

Student: The bigger one. 
 
Igor: 
Llama. 
 
Student: Llama. I went over to the llama, I stroked it and then there was darkness and 
then there was a mountaintop and then there was darkness and then there 
was a cave, and I was at the front of the cave – darkness. Then all I had was 
sort of flashes of light, nothing else. I couldn’t distinguish anything 
whatsoever. I thought okay, I’m going to go with it. 
Igor: 
I like that. 
 
Student: But I came out of it when you said come on back, and I thought well that was 
an interesting trip because I didn’t see anything. 
 
Igor: 
It sounds like you saw quite a bit. It just was more disjointed in between. 
Allow me to make a little comment on you experienced there. First of all, we 
talked about earlier on about people who were having some kind of 
amorphous experiences. 
 
 
Really what it sounds like is it’s not a question of you can’t see things and do 
things. You clearly did. It’s more a question of stability. Recall, yesterday was 
the day that we trained stability. Today is the day we’re training on conscious 
responsiveness. Tomorrow is the day we train control. 
 
 
We’ve got different stages that we have to go through and every one of you 
will falter at some point in that process. I did, everyone does. So, don’t take it 
too seriously. 
 
 
Secondly, don’t let one exercise determine what all the other exercises will 
give out because it could be the exercise. It could be a fluke. You could do this 
10 times and get one amorphous one and nine like this is totally on. That’s 
great. That’s a good average to be batting. 
 
 
Let me remind you of what we talked about yesterday, which is to say 
everything single one of you can do all this. Every single one of you will 
succeed at least in the initial stages, and I fully expect that for some of you – 
not for all of you – I will lose you somewhere along the way, and that’s 
because you’ve got to practice the more fundamental things first and get 
good at the skills, build the brain power, build the skill that will allow you to 
do the next level more easily.

I sympathize with you because I’ve been in exactly the same boat that you’re 
in right now. 
 
Student: I haven’t actually been able to follow or get these wonderful reactions since 
the first thing this morning. The first thing this morning I was okay. Since then 
it’s been wow, where am I? 
 
Igor: 
This is where you have an opportunity to practice a form of mindfulness with 
some stuff you’ve been doing. Just remember, I’m moving you through 
content at a particular pace, which may not suit you yet.  
 
 
Really what the Law of Successive Approximations is basically if you want to 
succeed at something, succeed in increments. Go from success to success. 
Each success will allow you to make bigger steps and still succeed the next 
time around. 
 
 
Any time you fail, you take back a step and go back to your previous point of 
success. Of course you lost today because you had a small disconnect and that 
continued to increase throughout the course of today. So, it’s just a question 
of going back to your point of success and building up there. 
 
 
Unfortunately – and this is the limitation of a big group training like this – I 
can’t work at everyone’s pace because if I worked at the pace of the slowest 
member of this group, it might take weeks to get through the materials. 
 
Student: I’m prepared to do that. 
 
Igor: 
You are and some other people here are, but I’m not. 
 
Student: Of course not. I understand. 
 
Igor: 
Please don’t beat yourself up about it. It does not matter where you are on 
that scale. There will be some things that will be easier for you and there will 
some things that will be harder for you, so just go with it.  
 
 
The point of having lots of exercises – and I’m writing them down for you – is 
so you can keep doing them on your own time. Tomorrow hopefully I’ll try to 
bring it down. I have a whole bunch of note sheets where I’m ticking off all my 
reiterations.

For example, just the stabilizing day – yesterday – to test myself once I’ve 
gone through the same training that you guys are going through, I decided I’m 
going to visit 100 rooms just to test myself out and I recorded it. 
 
 
It took me over three and a half hours to do it. I was sore. My throat was 
parched at the end of it, but things became very stable at that point. The 
same is true of this stage. This is the stage where we have spontaneity coming 
in.  
 
 
We want the unconscious mind to come in. We want it to discover, we want it 
to be spontaneous, we want it to be unexpected and so on and spontaneity is 
another skill that we’re still learning to navigate.  
 
 
It’s a more subtle skill and a lot of you have noticed when you’ve fallen off the 
edge, something you’re over-controlling and suddenly it all shuts down and 
becomes meaningless. Sometimes you have too little control and it becomes 
amorphous and starts falling apart, and that skill is somewhere in the middle. 
 
 
You’re close to it because you did have flashes of things. It’s just not stable 
yet, so you’ve got to bring some of what you did yesterday into what you’re 
doing today and stabilize it without interfering too much.  
 
 
That’s a skill that will develop over time. I can’t do it for you. I wish I could but 
that’s your neurology you happened to adapt. You’ve got to change your 
architecture.  
 
 
It’s like someone saying I went to the gym and lifting the five-pound weight 
was great but can’t seem to be able to lift the 50-pound weight. That’s 
because you’ve got to build up to it.  
 
 
So, continue your best with the exercises and treat that as an exercise in 
mindfulness so that you can keep your equanimity anyway regardless of 
what’s happening, and then you’ll always have the previous things you can go 
back to, to go back to the stability part of it and then mixing in the 
spontaneity. 
 
 
Recall yesterday evening we started getting more spontaneous with our tours 
of the neighborhood. We had people coming and different things and you 
were okay with that, right?

Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Even this morning. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Which tells me exactly where the disconnect is. Whilst you start with a stable 
environment, it’s easy for you to bring spontaneous in for you to change it a 
little bit.  
 
 
Now we’ve gone the other way. Remember, I did tell you we’re going into the 
deep end first, so that’s too much spontaneity, which is harder for you to 
control, to keep stable.  
 
 
In this session we’ll start looking at what are other ways of getting to that 
spontaneity which are a little easier to get to? It’s the longer path but it may 
be the faster route. We went through the faster route in the last session, but 
for some people it’s the longer one because they’re not ready for that kind of 
step yet. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. I’m glad you asked this. I appreciate it because I’m 
presuming that for every question like that that I get, at least 10% of the room 
wasn’t willing to ask the same question and I can see a few people sighing 
with relief and thinking I’m glad he asked that because it was really driving me 
crazy. I appreciate that. Thank you. 
 
Student: I’m going to ask a question that I think some people might be wondering as 
well. I’m wondering if rather than discovering, I’m creating the experience 
more. 
 
Igor: 
I can’t tell because I haven’t been in your mind. 
 
Student: Yes, I know. 
 
Igor: 
I need a little more information. What makes you suspect this?

Student: My intention going in, I said to myself what kind of landscape do I want to 
create this time? 
 
Igor: 
I understand. That’s tomorrow. You may or may not be over-controlling that. I 
don’t know yet. I haven’t heard enough yet but the reason we haven’t asked 
ourselves what kind of landscape do I want for myself right now is because 
the temptation to over-control it is much higher.  
 
 
Notice in the exercises all I asked you to do was to close your eyes and find a 
place you’ve never been before. I didn’t ask you to determine it ahead of 
time. Every single one – like the boat I was in – I had no idea it was going to 
come. 
 
 
In fact it started off as a blank void at first and it just emerged from that. The 
snowy landscape with the Yeti was the same deal. I just saw kind of a blank 
white space and it folded into a snowy landscape. 
 
Student: You just answered my question then because I went into thinking I had to 
create something and then see what happened.  
 
Igor: 
That level of control is useful but I want you to learn spontaneity before you 
have control because the temptation when having control like that is to over-
control and that interferes with the spontaneity part. 
 
 
I’m trying to teach you a very delicate mental skill, which is how do set the 
balance point between not controlling – in other words spontaneity – and 
being in control anyway? It’s a controlled spontaneity. It’s a very delicate 
place to be on. 
 
 
Has anyone here done improvisational theater, or maybe improvisational 
music or jamming with music and so on? It’s the same issue there, isn’t it? 
Let’s take the example of music.  
 
 
If you are jamming with other people and you over-control, you’ll ruin the 
tune because you’ll mess it up because you’re trying to do too much with it. 
You’ve got to find that blend. You’re on the opposite aspect of Larry.  
 
 
Larry is under-controlling, so it’s unstable. I don’t know because I haven’t 
even heard yet, but you’re possibly over-controlling, so it’s more like the 
things you did yesterday in terms of it’s very stable but it’s uninspiring.

Student: Yes, the reason I wondered if I was trying to create it is because I decided 
okay, I’ll be in this certain landscape and as I was there, the things that were 
bringing up the images were more like I wonder what it would be like if. 
 
Igor: 
And that’s a wonderful state of mind to be in and it actually works very, very 
well. In time that very mindset will go to just classic spontaneity. Once you 
habituate that, it actually can work very well.  
 
 
However, if you want to get to the unconscious material a little more quickly, 
we’re going to go for a hybrid of what we did in the last session and what 
you’re doing right now in this session, and hopefully that will help balance 
things out for you. 
 
 
Do most of you understand the discussion we’re having here? It’s a very 
subtle point. If we just talk about it as a theory, it just loses people, but having 
an experience with it hopefully helps put it in perspective. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Arthur: 
I’d like to know something about how we determine what occurred – what it 
means. 
 
Igor: 
Right now the meaning of things is of no value whatsoever because we’re still 
training things. Does it have meaning? Quite possibly but if you get wrapped 
up in the idea of what does it mean, what value is here right now, how can I 
use this, well then you’re not paying attention to the actual training part of 
the cycle, and you’re trying to do too much. It’s an extra step, an additional 
part of the skill. 
 
 
Rest assured by the end of tomorrow or the beginning of the next day, that 
side of things will start coming in more naturally. To give you kind of a 
placeholder, if you get stuck on something’s meaning it’s because in some 
respects you’re over-controlling because you’re trying to avoid and you’re not 
quite sure about hanging out with it or whatever.  
 
 
Let’s take an example of where that didn’t happen. This lady’s example over 
here when she was flying and her mother came and so on, she had no idea it 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
294 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
was going to happen and you can tell in the nature of the story – the bird 
transformed into her mother and of course the emotion that comes with it – 
that it was spontaneous and the meaning and the value of it became very, 
very apparent very quickly. 
 
 
If the meaning is not instantly apparent, it’s because at some level your 
conscious mind is doing a little bit too much. It’s trying too hard, so if being 
okay with ambiguity is unnerving it’s currently the best thing you can do.  
 
 
You’re asking in some respects the same question just in a different format. 
You should get to the point where whilst the meaning may be mysterious at 
first, eventually it clarifies and it becomes very obvious, or you have enough 
of a sense that you can feel the change happening even though you don’t 
know what it meant or what it was about, and your life still gets better 
anyways.  
 
 
It just depends on the individual, so feel free to carry on with that question 
unless that’s helped answer it. 
 
Arthur: 
The specific instance that I had was I was on a desert island and I saw a rabbit. 
I followed the rabbit. It went down a hole. I followed it down there but there 
were bars there, so I couldn’t get past but it stayed there to talk to me. I 
asked it what it would like and it said I want to have a human foot.  
 
Igor: 
As rabbits do, right? A little bit of revenge, right? 
 
Arthur: 
And I was a little concerned about that since I was the only person around, 
and I said to it… 
 
Igor: 
Let me pause you here. This is the point at which you probably lost the 
meaning. Can you hear what he said? I was a little concerned, so I did 
something else. 
 
 
Let’s put it this way. This is happening inside of your mind. If you were to chop 
off your mental foot and give it to your rabbit, one would come right back 
afterwards. You’re not going to lose your real foot because you’ve done this 
on a metaphorical landscape. 
 
 
What’s interesting here is the point at which you avoided the offer. Can you 
hear that? The offer of the interaction with the rabbit was here’s a gift I want 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
295 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
from you, and then you were saying oh I don’t know if I’m going to give that 
gift. 
 
Arthur: 
What happened after that was I said how about if I teach you English instead, 
and the rabbit said that would be fine, I was just testing you anyway. So, how 
do I know what that means? 
 
Igor: 
Well, in many respects remember you went into this not because you have a 
specific outcome in mind. You went into this because what are you trying to 
do? Build a relationship with your unconscious. Did you do that? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did it help? 
 
Arthur: 
Did what help? 
 
Igor: 
Did the experience you had, help build a better relationship with your 
unconscious? 
 
Arthur: 
I guess because the whole thing was unconscious. 
 
Igor: 
In that case, it’s done what its needed to do. Just because other people are 
having spontaneous therapeutic moments of healing and so on doesn’t mean 
that’s what we were searching for. That happened by accident.  
 
 
The unconscious mind hijacked an exercise to get something else it wanted or 
something it was time for and so on. I’m very glad it did because it makes my 
job easier to demonstrate what we were trying to achieve here but it wasn’t 
the purpose.  
 
 
The purpose was not to heal anything in your life. The purpose was not to 
overcome a problem or an obstacle or come up with a solution to things. That 
happens in two days’ time roughly. 
 
 
 
The purpose here was purely to learn to navigate a stable but spontaneous 
unconscious landscape. Did you do that? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes.

Igor: 
There you go. You succeeded. I’m sure there may be other elements that can 
be of value within that but they’re not important right now. You’re making life 
harder for yourself than you need to.  
 
 
Once you’ve done little journeys like this often enough, then the bigger 
journeys suddenly start making much more sense and become more 
spontaneous because you’ll learn how to work there. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I haven’t met somebody to interactive with. I have been in three different 
beautiful places. In one of them it was like castle and it was a big, big door and 
I tried to open the door but it was closed, so I must be very careful and very 
friendly to the door. I will go around. I’m going around and I saw a table and it 
was hot, food and everything but nobody around. 
 
Igor: 
No people, no movement, right? 
 
Student: No animals and I was looking for them. 
 
Igor: 
Usually when that happens it’s another variation of the kind of problem these 
two were having in terms of over-controlling. Your unconscious mind is still 
waiting for the opportunity to present that, and you still haven’t found quite 
the right point at which it clicks where you can just do it spontaneously. 
 
 
What do you think the message is if you’re looking around, something’s 
happening, you knock at this door, I’ll be very kind, you go in and there’s food, 
very kind, but where is the action? Where is everyone else? 
 
 
What have you just done to what you’ve received? There’s a form of dismissal 
there, isn’t there? Instead what I recommend that you do is you sit with it. If 
the door is locked, can you see a symbolism there? Are you surprised at the 
outcome of it? 
 
 
The door is locked. I didn’t do anything with it. So, it stays locked. Now if you 
try to unlock it or if you try to break it down, that might be a different kind of 
violation – in other words a different kind of fantasy may evolve at that point. 
 
 
 
So, my recommendation instead is if the door is locked, sit with it. Great, 
you’re locked. Do what you want. I’m just going to hang out with you for a 
while.

Student: I was touching that beautiful lead but I see it isn’t pushing.  
 
Igor: 
It doesn’t push, it doesn’t change. 
 
Student: I remember the exercise that we should be kind. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. So, you’re almost there. Then give it time. Instead of leaving 
straightaway, just hang out and give it time. That doesn’t guarantee it will 
change but if it doesn’t change this time, your mind realizes oh this person’s 
serious. Maybe the second time it doesn’t happen. Maybe the third time it 
doesn’t happen, but over time it will begin to happen. 
 
 
Here’s an example. In fact you heard it and you probably all missed it. I didn’t 
actually do it because I was dealing with these five steps yet, but remember 
when I was in the boat and I was looking at the water and there were these 
fish floating by? I ignored then when I went onto the land, didn’t I? 
 
 
There was motion and I didn’t follow it. My interaction would have been with 
those fish but I walked away. I did partly because it was time for you guys to 
do an exercise as well, but that’s where going back and doing the review you 
can say yeah, that’s the point at which maybe next time I’ll try something 
different. 
 
 
I can’t tell you how to symbolically walk through your symbolic landscape 
because that’s your job. I can just point out where either over-control or 
under-control is happening and give you some ideas as to what to do at that 
point. 
 
 
 
The simple answer by the way is if in doubt, sit with it. If it’s frightening, don’t 
run away. Sit with it. Let it do what it wants. If it’s pleasant, sit with it, enjoy 
and just absorb it. If it’s dull, sit with it and see if something happens. If it’s 
locked, sit with it and wait and see if it unlocks and something else happens. 
Maybe something comes round. 
 
 
If after a period of time it hasn’t happened, great, say thank you very much – 
still paying your respects – and just move on and try something else. You’re 
learning a very sophisticated, a very subtle skill and you’ve only been at this 
for about two days so far.

So, give yourselves a chance to adjust. It will take some time for some of you, 
and some of you are already ahead of the game, in which case you’re already 
there. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I just thought that maybe the subconscious is trying to tell you something 
when there is no action because I had two times something similar when 
there was no action but a beautiful landscape. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Student: And I was melding through there were houses but no people, no details and it 
actually felt to me like this is my subconscious helping me to go into an empty 
space to be in the state of meditation. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly and that might be actually its intent. Maybe it is exactly the fact that 
there’s nothing there that you get to relax, chill out, have your own private 
space without anyone wanting anything from you, which is fine. 
 
 
Again unless we’re doing it one-to-one and building up incrementally and so 
on, as a group all I can do is present you with the skills and I can present you 
with exercises to get the different skills, and then you have to go off and 
practice all kinds of different variations. 
 
 
Don’t expect to get it all in two days or three days. It took me months to be 
able to do this stuff. Some people get it quicker. Some people get it in less 
time. So what? It will happen eventually. Are there any other questions or 
comments? All right, this has been good.  
 
Spontaneity Progression 
 
Igor: 
In the last session we kind of dove in the deep end. We went totally 
spontaneous and most of you had at least form of experience from it. For 
some of you it wasn’t as perfect as you wanted. Either it was unstable or it 
was empty landscape and so on, which again is fine. 
 
 
How many of you actually had something interact with you and you actually 
had a chance to do all these five things in there? That’s excellent. That’s just a 
little bit over half the group.

Now what I want to do is see if we can approach the same place from a 
different angle, which is going to be a slower approach but hopefully an easier 
way to get there. Would that interest you? 
 
 
Here’s what I want you to do now. With this one, it will definitely help if you 
have a partner. It just helps you do this. We’re going to partner mode because 
that’s part of the stabilizing thing.  
 
 
Again you’re more than welcome to not do it with a partner and just have a 
mental partner that you describe these things to, but especially those of you 
who feel that you’ve been a little bit weaker in the last session, it will be 
worth your while having a partner so that you can more easily get the result. 
Does that make sense to you? 
 
 
It’s not necessarily. I’ve done it without partners but if in doubt, it will be 
another way of shoring up and making it a little easier for yourself. Those of 
you who want a partner, would you please stand up and look around so that 
you can actually find someone to work with? There’s only a few of you, which 
is good. 
 
 
We’re going to go through a round of exercises. If you have a partner, all I 
want you to do is turn to your partner and I want you to just out loud – you 
don’t have to close your eyes or anything – and like having a discussion, 
imagine you’re on the phone for example. 
 
 
I want you to describe this scene to them – a simple path. Just describe it to 
them. If you don’t have a partner, you can just close your eyes or just look off 
into space and imagine you’re on a phone call or something like that and 
describe this scene to someone. 
 
 
Please don’t actually call someone because when I call you back, you’ll have 
to hang up abruptly and that’s not so nice. Do you understand the exercise? I 
expect nothing other than a simple description of a photograph that you are 
seeing of a simple landscape. All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, there’s a road or a trail wide trail filled with leaves. I go through a forest 
with the sun shining in it and a lot of green grass, leaves from the trail, it looks 
like autumn leaves.

Igor: 
Okay, was that easy to do? Well, it should be easy. You have a photo and 
you’re describing it, right? Here’s what I’d like you to do now just as an 
experiment. All I want you to do now is close your eyes and see how easy it is 
to mentalize it. 
 
 
Remember, you can use all your stabilizing factors. You can still describe it 
inside your mind and still use your pantomime and so on. Just notice how 
easy it is to mentalize something approximating this particular image right 
now. We’ll just do it for a minute or so and then we’ll come back and have a 
chat. 
 
 
When you’re ready come back up, eyes open. Was that interesting? Who 
found it easy to mentalize that? Who found it was okay but it was a little 
difficult at times? Who found it was a little hazy? So, overall it was easy but 
there were some hazy bits, right? 
 
 
Let’s see if we can intensify that. Let’s see if we can get an easier, more vivid 
mentalization of this picture. With your partners again – or again if you did it 
on your own earlier on, just mentally use yourself as a partner.  
 
 
What I’d like you to do is again describe this picture to them, only this time I 
want you to add metaphors, similes and so on – in other words it’s like this, 
this tree reminds me of this, it’s kind of like a hand crawling up to the sky, etc. 
I don’t want to give you too many of my versions. I want you to have a chance 
to have your own ones. 
 
 
So, you’re describing it. First there’s a path, there are leaves, grass and that 
sort of stuff, but then you’re going to embellish it with some kind of 
metaphors, similes, etc. as you’re describing it. 
 
 
Once you’ve done that, then I want you to close your eyes again and 
immediately notice the mentalization that occurs, and compare it to the 
previous one you had. Is it more vivid or less vivid? 
 
 
If you have a partner, switch roles after that and they’ll have a go too. Do you 
understand the exercise? Off you go. 
 
 
So, eyes open. Just describe it, like there’s a pathway and there’s kind of a hill 
coming down on the one side, and it’s a slightly shallow slope that the path is 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
301 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
following. There’s a tree growing in front of us and so on. That’s the first 
version. 
 
 
Then once you’ve done that, just close your eyes and go oh, I can kind of see 
that a little bit. That’s good. Then the second round, which is the version 
we’re doing right now… 
 
Student: The first one is the forest? 
 
Igor: 
That’s the one we just did. The second one is identical. The addition we’re 
going to put in is metaphors, similes and so on. It’s just like you’re talking to 
someone again. There’s a pathway. There’s kind of a hill sliding down.  
 
 
The hill reminds me of the color of someone’s shoulder, and then there’s a 
tree on the left-hand side that’s reaching up as though there’s a clawed hand, 
but it has leaves on top of it. It makes it look very friendly. It’s kind of like just 
resting on the tips of his fingers.  
 
 
So, I’m using similes and metaphors to embellish the experience of that 
particular photograph. Once you’ve done that description for a bit, you’ll 
close your eyes and mentalize. You’ll close our eyes and then go oh look, it’s 
become a little more vivid. I can see the pathway better. 
 
 
Just compare the second mentalization to the first one. It’s the same image 
but do you see there’s a progression?  
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, there’s a road through a forest. The road is like the path of death and the 
leaves and all the green around are all the good things that could happen if I 
went off that track, that given track. 
 
 
So, there’s a picture of the forest with a road in it, around it. It’s almost like 
death occurred along that road and there’s life all around it. The autumn of 
life is making its way through the beautiful forest, and there are trees 
reaching towards the sky. 
 
 
There’s a picture of a pathway to something unknown. There’s a picture of a 
road through a forest, a green forest with the sun shining down and giving 
light to parts of the forest.

Igor: 
How did that go? Was that interesting? How did the first and the second 
version of mentalization compare to each other?  
 
Student: The first time I tried to visualize it, actually I remembered what it was like but 
I had a blank screen. I was actually going through the memory of the 
photograph. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here for a second because this is very exciting. Listen to 
what he said – I remembered the photograph but I had a blank screen. Isn’t 
this strange?  
Student: In my mind. 
 
Igor: 
How can you remember a picture when you’re not seeing it? What he’s 
describing there – and I appreciate you doing this. A lot of people have this, 
myself included, and I know this because for many years I could see no 
pictures in my mind but they’re there. 
 
 
The problem is there’s a veil of consciousness. It’s almost like the unconscious 
mind has drawn a curtain across it and saying I can see the picture but you 
can’t.  
 
 
That’s the bit you hang out with, you sit with, you integrate or whatever 
benevolent attention or whatever you want to think about – that’s when you 
do it because it’s working and you know that it’s working. It just has no 
awareness of it. 
 
 
By being that kind of gentle, kind, compassion – or whatever metaphor works 
for you – it allows time for the curtain to unveil itself again. Does that make 
sense to you? Thank you. That’s a wonderful description. Please continue. 
 
Student: And I sort of was able to describe it again but using the memory. The second 
time round I had more of a vivid realization of it. I didn’t see it like I’m seeing 
it now, but it was more vivid because the detail was there for me. The trees 
on the left seemed to have more branches. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Let me ask you this. Did you look at the picture first, then close 
your eyes, mentalize it and start describing it; or did you describe it with your 
eyes open seeing it, and then close your eyes and try to mentalize it? 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Student: I described it first to myself with my eyes open. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That’s exactly what I’m looking for. Good. So, let’s take the idea of 
the veil of consciousness aside for now. Overall you found the experience 
more rich and vivid than the first version of the experience. Is that correct? 
 
Student: Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Did anyone else have the same experience? Hands up. Wonderful. 
We’ll talk about that in a second but first I believe you had a comment you 
wanted to make as well. 
 
Student: Yes, I looked and I glanced and then I tried to describe it with closed eyes. I 
saw many things from a person standing… 
 
Igor: 
Let’s just pause a second. That’s a useful exercise to do but it wasn’t the 
exercise we were doing here. Just to be very clear on the exercise, just to help 
you, let me just do the exercise very briefly in front of you guys so that you 
can see it. 
 
 
Here’s the first version. I see a path. I’m looking at it and I’m describing it to 
you. I see a path with leaves on it. There’s a hill coming down one side. There 
are dozens of little trees, very thin trees on the right-hand side.  
 
 
The left-hand side trees seem to be a bit bigger and there’s a clump of three 
or four of them just to the left-hand side very close to me, and there’s more 
of a green leafy ivy type thing going down on the left side. 
 
 
I’ve described it out loud with my eyes open whilst looking at it. Now I close 
my eyes and I say oh I can see this. Then I’ll describe it to myself internally 
with my indoor voice.  
 
 
So, I see the path. I see leaves there. It’s kind of snaking around a little bit. 
There’s a hill there. I’m mentalizing it. The second version, once again eyes 
open. So, there’s a path. I can see the hill coming down. The path curves 
slightly. It kind of reminds me a bit of like a coral reef or a wave on a gentle 
ocean. 
 
 
Do you see the metaphor coming on here? Now on the left-hand side there’s 
a clump of like three or four trees. They kind of look almost like soldiers 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
304 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
standing at attention but not real soldiers. It’s a little bit menacing if you look 
at the bottom part of them. They’re a little more like highway robbers or 
something like that, but strangely when you look up higher, the whole thing 
looks like a cathedral. 
 
 
So now with my eyes open, I’m still describing it, and now I’ll close my eyes 
again and see what mental image comes up. The order is about as important 
because we’re doing something with the encoding process by looking and 
describing and then closing our eyes to see what impact it has on our inner 
reality. Does that make senses? 
 
Student: Okay, but I can’t stop thinking where’s the rest? 
 
Igor: 
Where’s the rest? We’re coming to that? So, you’re ahead of the game. Thank 
you for that. Do you all understand the nature of the exercise? Overall, was 
the second version more vivid and intense for you than the first version?  
 
 
What we’re doing is we’re beginning to interact with in this case the 
photograph, but we’re beginning to interact with it at increasing levels of 
depth.  
 
 
A pure description is one thing. A metaphoric description on top of that 
requires different kinds of brain circuitry to operate and so it gives you a more 
rich and detailed experience. The longer you spend doing that, the more vivid 
this image becomes. Does that actually track the experience of most of you in 
the room as well?  
 
 
Now we’re going to do a third version of the same exercise and the first two 
versions still count. So, you’ll still describe it just literally. You’ll describe it 
metaphorically in terms of the things you’ve seen symbolically and so on. 
 
 
The third level of description that I want you to add into it is to talk about the 
emotional or the mood-ness of it. For example, it feels friendly and 
welcoming, except that little tree. The third tree on the left-hand side looks a 
little menacing, like a little troll ready to attach. But overall, I feel quite safe 
walking down that path. There’s a bit of sunlight coming down, which is 
almost like the hand of God saying you’ll be okay here. 
 
 
Do you see there’s a mood, there’s a feeling on top of the metaphor, on top 
of the pure description of it? Do you understand the nature of the exercise?

Once I’ve done it with my eyes open, I will close my eyes again and once again 
mentalize it and enjoy it. Do you understand the next exercise? Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, there’s a picture of a road through a forest, and there’s a hill on the right-
hand side that makes the trees – there’s a road through a forest, a green 
forest that gives hope, yet the road is so very dead. The hill on the right-hand 
side symbolizes challenge and on the left-hand side there’s a wall of trees. 
 
 
There’s a road through a forest. The trees are all reaching for the sky while 
the road seems so drained of life. While the trees are reaching for the sky, the 
road tries to force itself on its visitors.  
 
 
The picture doesn’t give any options to deviate from the road. You have to 
follow the road, but there’s also a shimmer of light from the sun that gives 
hope to the image, hope that you will and should explore. 
 
Igor: 
How was that? Was that interesting? How was that third version of the 
mentalization process? Was it more vivid or less vivid than the previous two? 
It was more vivid, right? Did you say more rounded? There was more view in 
that image, right? 
 
 
Did you notice any progression as you started making a place that was just a 
photograph become more real for you? Here’s the kicker. This is the payoff 
now. Are you ready for the payoff? 
 
 
All of you just do this on your own for now. All of you just close your eyes and 
I want you to mentalize the same pathway in whatever way comes natural to 
you. Once you’re standing on that pathway, just look to your left and look to 
your right. What else do you see? 
 
 
Then decide to move somewhere. Just add motion forwards, back, up or 
down – I don’t care which way – and notice the landscape changing. How do 
you feel as that happens? By feeling, I mean it can be both physical sensation 
like a foot on the ground, or an emotion like it’s happy, it’s pleasant, calm or 
whatever. 
 
 
I’d like for you to keep traveling down this path until you come across 
something you did not expect. When you do, pay your respects. Say hello, say

thank you. Sit with it for a while pleasantly and benignly and then come on 
back. 
 
 
Once you’ve sat with it for a while, just come on back and face the front so 
that I know to continue. There are about three-quarters of you back so far. So, 
how was that?  
 
 
This is the interactive portion, just so you know. You get to stand up and tell 
me about all four experiences, and please compare them, especially that last 
one compared to the other three. Tell me a little bit about what happened. 
 
Student: Ever since we did the – way back, four back – I was feeling like it was very 
prosaic, just really prosaic, nothing like anything. When we had to do that last 
one when we went into the forest, it started to feel like a Google map and it 
was doing the whole everything first of all. 
 
 
Then secondly when you said to see something you didn’t expect, I was 
walking down the path and somebody like when you’re at sea and you’re 
going to drown and they throw down the raft and the package, and you kind 
of blow it up and everything. Then I found one on the floor next to me. 
 
Igor: 
That would definitely be unexpected. Excellent. How many people here found 
unexpected things? Hands up. How many people tried to do it, or did it just 
happen? Did it occur at an unexpected point in your journey? That’s the point. 
 
 
Not only have you collected a new place, but you also have transformed it 
into a place where spontaneous things can occur. So, this is a hybrid between 
what we did earlier on with the strange new world – in other words over-
controlling and under-controlling. Does that make sense to you? What other 
kind of experiences did you have? 
 
Student: The first time when we just described it to ourselves, I just tried to walk in it 
and I couldn’t go anywhere and then when we got progressively more and 
then I scrambled up the hill at the end. 
 
Igor: 
How realistic did that hill seem to you? 
 
Student: Too realistic because I was like why did I go up the hill?

Igor: 
This is important. Again, does this describe the general experience in the 
room?  
 
Student: The first picture was very pleasant, very nice and I felt very comfortable with 
it, but all of a sudden it took speed and everything was going past me, flying 
by maybe 100 miles an hour by me, and it was getting darker and darker and 
closing in and closing in, and then I saw these old slate buildings, low buildings 
and like old cobblestones and doors were opening. This woman appeared in 
black and she was trying to take me through these gates. 
 
Igor: 
How did you deal with it? 
 
Student: I went with it. I was scared at first because it was a little intimidating, but I 
went with it. She was taking me through these very old-looking wrought iron 
gates and then I stopped and I thought no, I don’t want to know anymore.  
 
 
But the picture in my mind went backwards at great speed. It was like coming 
through a tunnel at great speed, and that happened the three different times 
that I was doing it, so it was quite fascinating. 
 
Igor: 
So, clearly there was something there, right? 
 
Student: It just took me. It was like a vacuum. 
 
Igor: 
Here are a couple of things just to point out the kind of lessons we’ve been 
talking about today. First of all, did you notice the balance between conscious 
and unconscious interaction? The surprise is the unconscious. We just used 
this as a starter fire to get things going. It’s like the spark to let the 
unconscious mind then have something to work with. 
 
 
Notice how it’s irrelevant where you start to where you end up. This has 
nothing to do with a low walled city with wrought iron gates and so on, but 
that was clearly the message her unconscious mind wanted to provide, so it 
just borrowed this as something to get started with and then moved it onto 
something else. Does that make sense? 
 
 
The other that’s important here is did you also notice the level of control? At 
first when it was only mildly scary, you went with it, which is great. As the 
creepiness or whatever you want to call it intensified, you decided that’s it, 
I’ve had enough and then stopped. You had control at that level, correct?

Student: I did. 
 
Igor: 
The final thing – and this is just an addition to what you did there, just to get 
more out of this for yourself – when you get to the point where you’ve had 
enough and say I don’t want to go any further, instead of retreating from it 
just sit there and say I’ll just stay here, and again with benign breathing and 
the integration breathing and so on. That’s what you do there with that 
feeling of insecurity or that feeling of fear. 
 
Student: I did a little bit of that.  
 
Igor: 
You did that? 
 
Student: I said I’ll stay here because there was a white wall as well as all the grey dark 
ones and it was like underground, so then I thought no, I’m going back in. The 
feeling I got from looking at the picture was it was too innocent looking and 
there was something behind it. 
 
Igor: 
And that’s where the intention comes in. Do you see how subtle – you just 
noticed the subtly in the intention and as soon as your mind went there’s 
something else, it gave it to you. It was like fine, you want to distress it, I’ll 
show you exactly what you expect. 
 
 
Notice again the subtlety of that. We’ll call it an expectation but it’s still an 
intention in that sense because you weren’t fully aware of it consciously, so 
you didn’t understand its impact until you had it. 
 
 
This happens a lot in our lives, by the way. We have these little sneaking 
suspicions in the back of our mind. Some of them bear witness in reality but 
some of them we’re just not aware of enough until we’ve made them real. 
 
 
It’s that person we think really secretly about and then we do something that 
really upsets them and we prove ourselves right. Look how he’s treating me. 
That’s part of how we our own little self-fulfilling realities, our own little self-
fulfilling prophecies as well. Make sense? 
 
 
But if you’re aware of it, if you notice that little moment, then you know 
where the cause is, and then you can start thinking instead of going down this 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
309 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
track, I’m going to sit with that intention. Do I really think that this is too 
innocent?  
 
 
That’s the point where you get to change the intention and say actually this is 
a better intention. What if it were and suddenly you go to a light place, a 
happier place, a more comfortable place?  
 
 
Either place is fine with me, by the way. Good and bad both have their value. 
What I’m interested in is the subtleties of navigating through your inner 
landscape, and I think this is a very wonderful example of doing that. Was that 
useful for you? 
 
Student: Yes, I understand.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you very much. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: We’ve already spoken about my one, two, three and in this one what 
happened was the path was just a different color in sepia. The rest was all 
black and white and I can move more closer, I thought it was a bad thing. 
Basically, what happened was I could see the path and then it was like wood 
wisps were appearing. It would appear like a little man or a stick or something 
– white, way far away and disappeared. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now given what you said before, I’m not surprised. You were right 
on the cusp between the control and the spontaneity. You stabilized that 
picture but then the spontaneous bit is just more on the edge of it, so you’re 
right on the cusp of letting the unconsciousness comes through into that 
territory. Can you kind of see that happening? 
 
 
It’s a little bit on the side of more over-control, which is why it’s disappearing 
again, but that’s fine because if you hang out there long enough and benignly 
enough, it will clarify. Will it do it the first time around? Not necessarily. The 
second time? Maybe not. The third time? Who knows? 
 
 
But if you’re patient with it, eventually your unconscious mind learns to trust 
you and says great, I can present all these things without him interfering too 
much with it.

Student: What I did is I apologized to myself and said thank you very much and I’m 
sorry that I treated you bad and I apologize. I said thank you very much for 
whatever you’ve given me. It doesn’t matter if it’s small. That’s when I started 
to get the wisps. 
 
Igor: 
Again I’m not surprised. Can you hear the normal relationship dynamic that 
happens in the outside world and that happens in a dynamic, where you have 
a problematic relationship with someone and you’ve apologized sincerely, 
and they say I accept that but I’m still wary? I’ll give you a little leeway but I’m 
still wary. 
 
 
You’re slowly building that relationship back up again. Do you see where I’m 
going with this?  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I appreciate that. That’s a very useful thing. Was this a useful 
exercise for you guys? Did you learn something from it? Are you beginning to 
notice there are lots of little subtleties or nuances going on inside your mind?  
 
 
In that case, I think this is enough for us today. You’ve worked hard. I’d just 
like you to remember the five basic rules we’ve gone through so far that will 
help you navigate these landscapes, and that important point where there’s 
an element of control and an element of letting go of control, and when you 
find the right balance point your unconscious mind will come up. 
 
 
You’ve seen enough instances of powerful and moving and important events 
happening, enough instances of seeing the exercise seems trivial. They’re 
both equally valid because what’s important is the way you build the 
relationship with your unconscious, and that’s really the important thing of 
today. 
 
 
Tomorrow it will be more about control, but then again knowing what you’ve 
experienced about over-control and spontaneity, some of you will do much 
better at it than others.  
 
 
Do not concern yourself in which camp you are. What’s important is that you 
have a nice simple pathway to go from the beginning – walk around my 
neighborhood – to where we are here where some much wilder, much more 
creative and spontaneous things are occurring. Would that be fair to say?

Do you have any questions? In that case, I wish you a very good night. Think 
about Dublin, the city that you’re in, and I wonder if you can collect some of 
the streets that you’re living around. Just take them home with you and really 
explore them properly in the comfort of your own home. With that happy 
thought, I wish you goodnight and I’ll see you in the morning.

DVD 9 – How To Control Mental Experiences 
Without Over-Controlling And Blocking 
Unconscious Content 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Once again, good morning everyone. How’s everyone doing? Is everyone 
having fun? Who slept well last night? Who felt their brain was really 
exercised, kind of worked out and it’s like yeah, quieting my mind today is 
really easy because it’s too much effort to think? 
 
 
We’re going to intensify in some respects the work we did yesterday, and 
there are a couple of things I’d like to know before we even go down that 
road.  
 
 
 
The first thing is, especially for you folks at home, if all you’ve been doing is 
watching the DVD’s and not doing the exercises, then you may well get lost. 
I’m just saying that so that you understand – you guys already from yesterday 
noticed that it’s starting to get more demanding of you. 
 
 
The beauty of this course is that I don’t expect you to do everything perfectly 
in here. You have time to do that. When I put myself through this process, it 
took me about a month or two to be stable at all the different levels, so you 
have time. 
 
 
All I want you to do is know how to do it so that when you go home and you 
can decide okay, I’m going to work on this set of skills for a while and I’m 
comfortable with that, and then I’ll go through this set of skills, and I’m going 
to do this set of skills and so on. 
 
 
As a rule of thumb, you know that you’ve become proficient at a skill when 
you start getting bored with it. If I asked you all to just do a simple tour of 
your home right now, you’d say yeah I can do it but it’s not very exciting, 
because you’ve become proficient at that very quickly. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
313 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
If I asked you to start going to strange new worlds and exploring them, some 
of you can do it and some of you are still a little hazy about it, but I suspect 
few of you are actually bored with that exercise yet. Would that be fair to 
say? So you may be competent at it, but you’re not quite proficient at it yet 
and that tells you where to keep practicing.  
 
 
The same is true of today’s skills. If at some point you feel like oh I really can’t 
get this, I’m not sure what to do with now or I’m not getting the results that 
he’s asking for and so on, then do not concern yourself about that.  
 
 
Honestly, do not concern yourself about that. Just note the nature of the 
exercise and realize that the stuff you did in the last two days will build you up 
towards it, so when you go home you’ll be able to spend more time doing the 
first day’s mentalizations and yesterday’s mentalizations and so on, and by 
the time you get onto the stuff that we’re doing today it will be much easier 
for you too. 
 
 
I want to emphasize this point because I don’t want anyone here to feel like 
oh I’m failing, I can’t do this and so on. I’m moving at a steady pace but that 
pace may not be the right pace for you.  
 
 
For some of you it will be perfect, for most of you it will be a little off kilter 
and for some of you it will be a little while before the material will actually be 
of use or value to you. So, treat yourselves nicely when you get to that point 
and realize you have the progression. You have the ladder that will get you to 
this point in due course. 
 
 
Before we launch into the content this morning, what I want to do is just 
throw the floor open for a general question and answer session just to get a 
sense of your experiences, what you’ve been doing and if you have any 
questions about all the stuff that we’ve been doing so far. 
 
Student: I just wanted to say that the walk here was enjoyable because I could look at 
the architecture and all the details and it was like it was filling my mind with 
things for the future today. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Welcome to my world. I did the very same thing. In fact, where’s 
our friend who lives in the youth hostel from the first day? Do you mind 
standing up a second just to do discuss this? This is something that you’ll all 
experience.

Yesterday’s exercise with the photograph, the landscape – do you remember 
that one? That’s an artificial way of doing something, which much more 
naturally happens – like Dave discussed and we discussed the other day. Do 
you want to say a little bit about how after trying to hazily mentalize your 
hotel room on the first day, what happened when you went back and actually 
looked at your room? 
 
Student: After I got back into the hotel it immediately started filling in the details that I 
wasn’t sure about. 
 
Igor: 
Did you have to make an effort? Did you have to remind yourself oh I’ve got 
to look at this window, oh I’ve got to memorize this, or did it just kind of 
happen? 
 
Student: The first thing that popped into my head was I walked into the room. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: And on the left-hand side on the floor there was either a big mirror or it was a 
big white wall but I couldn’t remember. So, I was immediately confirming 
okay there’s a big mirror on the left and I wasn’t sure whether it was a desk or 
whether it was a shelf. Obviously I immediately confirmed that as well.  
 
 
I thought the first day as well that there were yellow curtains, but I discovered 
there were actually no curtains in the room. It was kind of like a net curtain, 
but it was a yellow streetlight outside, which was projecting a yellow light into 
the room. 
 
Igor: 
This is the thing that I want to emphasize to you guys. The details fill 
themselves in on their own accord. You didn’t have to make any effort with it, 
and that’s the beauty of the mentalization process the way we’re doing it 
here. 
 
 
If you have difficulty with the landscape, all you have to do is sit in it and your 
mind will automatically fill the pictures in. Because you’ve gone through the 
effort to try to mentalize it and you’re not sure about some details, as soon as 
you walk the landscape your mind will automatically grab those details, 
provided it’s been within a certain period – like 24 hours or so – of you doing 
that practice.

That makes your life very easy to collect things. It makes your life a lot easier 
also when you go on holiday because you can go there for less time and enjoy 
it for longer. I appreciate that. Thank you for much for that. 
 
Student: One of the other things I wanted to mention was that I usually don’t really 
look at the floor when I’m walking, but I was wearing heavy boots, and other 
signs as well where it kind of filled in. 
 
Igor: 
Basically as we grow older as a rule we tend to ignore our senses more and 
more because we habituate. One of the things that this process is doing is 
opening you back up to your senses again. Doesn’t it make your life a little 
richer? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The more you do this in your own neighborhood, your day-to-day life and so 
on, the more things you’ll notice which will be of interest. Then it gets to the 
point where it’s really interesting actually. Please don’t do this until you’ve 
been doing some mindfulness for a while because otherwise you’ll lose track 
of reality.  
 
 
I can walk down the road and I can put myself in it as though I were actually 
mentalizing it and then for a while I have no idea – am I mentalizing it or am I 
just walking down the road? Which is going on?  
 
 
I’m comfortable with the ambiguity to be fair, which is why it’s important to 
do some mindfulness practice before you get to that point so that you can 
distinguish between reality. That’s an important thing to be able to do in this 
world. Thank you. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: I want to share what happened yesterday. I was in a circus and I saw a clown 
sideways, a very colorful typical clown, and it’s moving like sideways, very 
powerful. So, I start to look around in the circus but there are not so many 
people there. So, I see my brother sitting on the stands and I’m thinking oh no 
not again, but then I thought I have to do the good feeling towards everything 
that’s coming.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
316 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, I’m moving towards him. I’m going to sit next to him and I thought that 
was a gift to him to welcome him in the circus. So, I asked for a gift from him 
but later on I thought maybe that was a little bit too soon. 
 
Igor: 
It’s worth asking, right? 
 
Student: Yes, and I could give him more. There was an internalization afterwards, but 
he gave me the gift that actually would be the answer of my “blockage” 
because he said if you welcome me, then I’ll let you completely go. You can 
do whatever you want, so the internal dialog that says I can’t do stuff with 
you disappeared.  
 
 
Immediately I started to get sad and I thought oh God don’t go. So, he said 
yeah but you want me to go and then you don’t want me to go. Then I 
thought okay now I have to deal with this sadness, so I was just floating 
around with the good feeling of equanimity around that sadness.  
 
 
Then I thought well maybe that is not really the biggest transformation I need 
to make. Maybe there was something else that will make me grow even more 
than what I was thinking it was holding me back. So, I wanted to share that. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. I appreciate that. Give him a round of applause for that. There are 
a couple of things I want to note from that experience. Hopefully a lot of you 
are already having similar experiences. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
We’re not actually at the “self-therapy” or the healing stage yet. That’s 
actually stuff for tomorrow. We’re still at the let’s build some skills today, but 
already a lot of you are spontaneously using the skill that you’re developing 
here for bettering your own lives. 
 
 
Even though that’s not the stage you’re at yet, it’s already immediately 
apparent how even the five rules we have of the Flight Club make life a lot 
easier on you, especially in your internal environment.  
 
 
It helps you clean up your inner landscape so that it’s a healthier, happier, 
more vibrant place and of course then the outside world becomes a healthier, 
happier, more vibrant place for you.

The one thing I will add to that is, don’t be in too much of a hurry to do that 
cleaning up process. If it’s little things, it’s fine for now. We haven’t actually 
come onto the full actual methods for that yet. We’re still building some skills.  
 
 
Secondly, in terms of the actual material that you handle, remember that 
mindfulness is your safety harness. Your ASH Practice should go hand in hand 
in terms of the depth you go to with your mindfulness training. 
 
 
So, the more difficult the problem is that you’re facing, the more mindfulness 
you’ve done beforehand to make sure that you go through it in a safe sort of 
manner. I can’t tell you how much that’s going to be. You have to know it for 
yourself. It’s your mind. 
 
 
Occasionally you’ll scare yourself a little bit because you’ve gone too far, in 
which case you’ll say okay, a little more mindfulness. Then at other times you 
get bored, which tells you that you’re moving too slowly. 
 
 
Really that stress/boredom line is always going to tell you are you working too 
slow or too fast? That’s going to be your speedometer shall we say. Thank you 
for that. That’s very useful. Does anyone else have a comment? 
 
Winfried: Well, just a quick question. Yesterday and the night before going to sleep, I 
wanted to go over the exercise before and the last exercise before that partly 
but I could not remember the instructions. The exercise worked wonderfully 
though. 
 
Igor: 
What we had was yesterday before we collected our landscape, first of all we 
did that neighborhood tour and we started looking for interactions within it. 
Remember that one? We started looking for people to interact with.  
 
 
We had a gentleman over here who followed a car and then had a nice 
argument with himself and the car. A couple of people were having 
amorphous things and so on.  
 
 
After that, we played the strange new world. The strange new world is very 
simple. Basically you close your eyes and ask your unconscious to present a 
landscape to you that you have never seen before. It could be a real 
landscape or an imaginary one.

When it comes to collecting landscapes, which we did in the final session with 
the photograph, that’s just a steppingstone to doing it freestyle and letting 
your unconscious mind fill in the details for you. 
 
 
So, you can either do it by collecting landscapes and then going onto the 
strange new world, or if you want to go in the deep end you can do strange 
new world and then shore it up from time to time with new landscapes. It 
doesn’t really matter so much. 
 
 
The importance of both of those – the strange new world and the collecting of 
a new landscape – the main thing I’m going to encourage you guys to focus on 
there is practicing the core five rules for Flight Club. I’ll come back to this in a 
moment to show you the rules again. 
 
 You want to discover things rather than creating them, which means 
the more unexpected or surprising it is the better.  
 
 You want to move through the landscape. It will help you stabilize it 
and you want to follow movement. 
 
 You want to interact with it. In other words, if something’s moving 
you’ll follow it. We’ll talk more about that in terms of animism and 
stuff in a little bit. 
 
 You want to talk with a figure there. You want to maybe touch it and if 
it doesn’t let you interact with it, then you want to just sit there 
mindfully, so you’re being aware of it but not trying to force 
interaction. You want to offer an interaction without forcing 
interaction. That word ‘forcing’ is a very important concept to avoid.  
 
 Respecting of course. That means you have your normal social 
manners, which is be polite, say hello, say goodbye. 
 
 In particular when you’ve done some kind of work like with your 
brother, for example, give a gift and ask for a gift.  
 
 
That’s kind of the symbolic opportunity for your unconscious mind to release 
material that it’s had held repressed along with the negative stuff as well. 
Once you release the negative stuff, why not reclaim whatever positive stuff 
was linked to that as well? Do you get the idea?

Of course sometimes when you ask for a gift, it will tell you that you just got it 
because you had a feeling of exhilaration or a sense of empowerment or an 
insight or an idea, in which case that’s good. Thank you very much. Move on. 
 
 
Other times it will give you something extra, in which case that’s wonderful. 
You get a double bonus. But if you don’t ask, you don’t get.  
 
 Finally we have the main five rules. 
 
 
 
We have the idea of equanimity. That’s so important. It’s more important 
with the negative stuff than with the positive but it’s also important with the 
positive stuff. The importance with the negative stuff is that you don’t make 
things worse.  
 
 
Remember the rule of thumb: 
 
 When it comes to your internal environment, you’re either making 
things better or you’re making them worse. There’s no real status shall 
we say. 
 
 
If you turn up and you’re frustrated and angry with it and so on, you’ve just 
added that anger, you’ve added that frustration to the mix, and the armor 
holding that stuff back gets a little thicker.  
 
 
If you’re there with that benign attention, that benevolence, the kindness, the 
compassion, the good feeling – however you conceptualize that or whatever 
works for you – then that emotional atmosphere surrounds it and it takes a 
little layer of the pain away. 
 
 
Those are the rules. We’ll come up to the last two rules today and of course 
here are the exercises again for your enjoyment. Does that help you, 
Winfried? 
 
Winfried: Yes, very much. 
 
Igor: 
Good.  
 
Student: Is it that you first give a gift or ask for a gift?

Igor: 
It doesn’t matter. That’s up to your mind. You’ll develop your own habits.  
 
Student: Do you mind clarifying the equanimity? 
 
Igor: 
The rule of equanimity is very simple. There are three core things that can 
happen that can throw you off your stride.  
 
1. Something very good happens, something exciting, something joyful 
and that’s fantastic.  
 
 
When something like that happens and you feel that sense of joy – for 
example when your mother came – a lot of people want to rush through it. 
They’ll say oh it’s great, now what am I going to do next? So, then the 
equanimity part is just sit with it. 
 
 
Sit with the excitement and the joy and absorb it, appreciate it, appreciate the 
fact that your unconscious has just done something like that. If you appreciate 
it – in other words put benign attention on it – then the chances of getting 
more of that are much higher. That’s one possibility. 
 
 
The next possibility is that: 
 
2. Something bad will happen. 
 
 
You’ll feel fear, pain, anxiety, stress, sadness, grief and all kinds of negative 
emotions, and each one of us will have our own coping mechanism with these 
things. 
 
 
Typically when things like that happen, we want to leave, we want to avoid or 
we want to fight. You know the fight or flight response? Really there are 
actually three responses – fight, flight or freeze – and you don’t want to do 
any of those three.  
 
 
With the gentleman who followed the car and the people came out and had 
an argument – that’s fight. Then I believe there was the gentleman where the 
ground dropped away and he left – that’s flight.  
 
 
On occasion you’ll have freeze where you get overloaded and you don’t know 
what to do – that’s freeze. There may be attention on it but it’s not benign. If 
something negative happens, your job is to sit with it but again with that 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
321 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
sense of benign attention. It’s like okay you’re here you’re doing your thing, 
that’s good, that’s just fine.  
 
 
I like Martin’s description very nicely with his brother. Clearly it symbolized 
something unpleasant for him but instead of avoiding – which is flight – 
instead of fighting with him or confronting him – which is of course fight – he 
just sat down with him and welcomed him. 
 
 
So, for him the idea of welcoming was that benign attention. Notice that you 
might do it differently. You might do it with joy. You might do it with kindness. 
You might do it with patience. You might do it with sympathy or empathy.  
 
 
I don’t know how you will do it. That’s your strength. That’s your 
responsibility, but you understand what I’m saying here. That’s where you 
start peeling layers off the layer cake there. 
 
 
The third thing that can happen is – and this is really the same as the bad in 
some ways but it’s more disguised: 
 
3. The scenery doesn’t give you exactly what you want in some ways. 
 
 
For example, you may turn up, and like the lady yesterday with the door that 
was locked, she can’t get through. Or with this gentleman over here when he 
saw like a hazy wall and wasn’t sure if it was a mirror or a wall or something 
like that.  
 
 
Instead of getting frustrated with that, instead of trying to push and force it – 
which of course is then negative attention, it’s frustrated attention, that’s the 
third type of situation – then just sit with it. It’s like okay I can’t quite make 
out what’s there, so I’ll just sit for a while. 
 
 
Either it will clarify, in which case you say thank you very much or it doesn’t 
clarify, in which case you say great, now I’ll move onto something else. The 
point is you haven’t rushed past it and left a pebble in your shoe so to speak. 
 
 
Those are the three key things that tend to happen and all of them are 
treated the same way, which is with benign attention. Does that help? 
 
Student: Thank you.

Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: I had a question actually between two of the exercises we did yesterday. 
When we were doing the inner landscape, I found I really enjoyed that. 
 
Igor: 
Do you mean the new landscape, the photograph or the strange new world? 
 
Student: No the one where we just discovered what was there. For me, that actually 
was a wonderful experience. It made me feel like I was eight years old when 
you’ve just got an amazing imagination, no judgment. It was fantastic. 
 
 
When we did the photograph, it was a completely different experience for me 
because the moment I closed my eyes, it was black clouds. It was almost like a 
complete refusal to show me anything.  
 
 
When we did the bit with the emotion in it though, I could completely sense 
the picture but I couldn’t see a thing. For me it felt like my subconscious part 
was out of the way in the earlier experience, but for some reason – and I 
don’t know if it’s my conscious part was too involved or is it a case of my 
unconscious mind didn’t want to interrupt. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. Let me preframe the answer by saying the most important 
thing, which is I don’t know because I’m not sitting inside your mind, but I can 
give you some likelihoods.  
 
 
First of all, your unconscious mind may have just enjoyed one exercise more 
than the other, in which case it said just do this one. Why waste your time 
with the other one?  
 
 
They may both have value but the strange new world one is actually more 
useful to you in many ways because you’re no longer dependent on external 
reality for your internal reality to become enriched, but for some people that 
will be reversed. In other words, they loved collecting new landscapes – the 
photograph – but they had a problem working with the other one. 
 
 
These are just exercises, training wheels to get you to be able to do something 
mentally. In time you’ll be able to walk down the street and collect 
architecture, walk into a room and it will collect it automatically, look a photo 
and say I’m going to keep that one. It will say you can’t, it’s mine. No, don’t

worry. I’ve already made a copy, and of course do the whole strange new 
world were, you create your own versions too. 
 
 
These are just different skills that you can work with. Whenever something 
unexpected happens, you can pretty much bet on the fact that your 
unconscious mind is involved with that.  
 
 
If it’s unexpected and unpleasant in some way – which it sounds like it was a 
little bit with the dark clouds and so on – then you can almost guarantee that 
it’s something you’re being made an offer to resolve something. 
 
 
Again, I don’t know what that is, so my default setting for that is usually to sit 
with it for a while. Sometimes that clears up. Often that will clear it up. It 
depends on the nature of things. Sometimes it doesn’t but if it doesn’t that’s 
okay.  
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll come onto skills of handling what happens if things don’t 
clear up on their own. For the moment, the general rule is sit with it use your 
equanimity, your benign attention.  
 
 
I’m just using different metaphors to hopefully catch all the things, and it 
sounds very much like you actually did. You didn’t get stressed about the 
darkness. You were curious about it, like all right that’s fine, it’s here.  
 
 
As to what it actually means, only you can answer that and I suspect you will 
answer that once you’ve gone through the dark clouds to whatever is behind 
that and have resolved whatever block was there. Then you’ll know it for 
yourself and it will make total sense to you, and we’ll still stare at it like how is 
that clouds? What? 
 
 
Does that help you a little bit? I wish I could give you a clearer answer but 
unfortunately – well, actually fortunately – everyone is different and you have 
to learn to work with your own mind rather than just with mine. Thank you. 
That’s was a good question. I appreciate that. Are there any other questions 
or comments on what we did yesterday? 
 
Student: For instance, in that last experience I found as I was getting through the 
forest, I realized that I was dressed in a different way and I knew what was 
around the corner and had all these memories and experiences of things I’d 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

done there when I was very… small. I’ve done quite a bit of improv theater, 
because you always need... 
 
Igor: 
Not anymore, exactly. In some respects, your improv partner here is your 
unconscious, which is really the best partner to have anyways. Did you notice 
what he said here? When he entered that picture, not only do you know 
what’s coming or what had happened before, he also was dressed different, 
somehow appropriate for the scene. 
 
 
That’s the steppingstone into something we’ll be doing this evening, towards 
the end of today, so you’re ahead of the game. Well done. Thank you for that. 
I appreciate that.  
 
Mental Warm-ups 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s start with the warm-up with a mindful practice. You have various 
options for mindfulness now. You can do the mindfulness movement. At the 
end of each mindfulness practice, I always encourage you to do the 
integration breathing, where you just let whatever tension you’ve built up just 
settle in whatever you’re doing.  
 
 
For example, if you do mindful movement or you then do a sitting practice 
afterwards – the mindful breathing – you will probably be more aware of your 
body.  
 
 
If you do it with the breath count, then when you do the sitting practice 
afterwards – the integration type of breathing – then you’ll be more aware of 
your breathing. It typically will rest on whatever your attention was on. 
 
 
I don’t care which practice you do. All I want you to do is spend a minute or 
two doing something mindful to begin with to kind of prime the pump and 
charge it. Then just bask in that afterglow and sit with that for a few minutes. 
That’s going to get your minds into the right space. Off you go. 
 
 
So, that’s kind of like the warm-up act. It’s a nice way to settle your mind 
done before doing any work. Remember, the more turmoil is in your mind the 
more strenuous physical movement will help you collect that attention back 
in again, but it’s not the only way to do it. The breathing is good and so on 
too.

What I’d like you to do now is just to warm up your mentalization muscle by 
visiting any location you want inside your mind. It could be in your home, it 
could be a place you’ve been before or it could be a street. I don’t care what it 
is. Just visit it, look around, note it, do the whole pointing and discussing it 
and so on. 
 
 
Here’s the thing I want you to do at the end of that. Just do that as a warm-up 
and then we’ll come back and we’ll add the second later in a moment. Off you 
go. 
 
 
Going forward, I would like to encourage you to develop a personal ritual for 
doing the mentalization practice. This will help to again stabilize the work that 
you’re doing and also importantly create distinctions between when you’re 
working on the inside and when you’re doing stuff on the outside. That’s an 
important distinction to be able to make.  
 
 
The ritual I’m going to encourage you to do is start off with some kind of a 
warm-up. The breathing count or the mindful movement are the best. I 
personally like the mindful movement because it counteracts my tendency to 
fall asleep.  
 
 
I spent many years training my conscious mind to get out of the way, and then 
after that being lazy when I’m doing self-hypnosis to drift off into sleep 
afterwards because I enjoy that. Now I have to undo years of doing that kind 
of work. 
 
 
You may prefer something different. It doesn’t matter to me. The point 
though is you’ll start your practice with some kind of centering type thing. 
Whether it’s the breathing count or whether it’s the mindful movement, it 
doesn’t really matter. 
 
 
Then you’ll do your mentalization work. In this case it was a very simple thing. 
At the end of it we’ll add a few more pieces but for the moment all I want you 
to do at the end of it is have a period of integration breathing, where you 
don’t attempt to do anything.  
 
 
It’s not the same as saying clear your mind out or stop your internal dialog or 
anything like that. If that happens to be the case, then fantastic, well done. 
But that’s not the point. The point is you’ve done some work.

Imagine you’ve gone to the gym and you’ve just run and you’re tired and 
you’ve worked out. This is the equivalent of at the end of it you sit down and 
just bask in that glow.  
 
 
Does anyone here do yoga? I don’t know if you’re aware of this but in yoga 
the most important posture is the shavasana, the relaxation or the corpse 
pose afterwards and ironically is the one that a lot of gyms completely forget 
about because it’s not strong. It’s not like moving and doing stuff. So, it’s the 
mental equivalent of that.  
 
 
It’s three simple steps. You have your warm-up, do your mentalization and 
then you have a period at the end as your kind of cool-down. For the moment 
it will just be the integration breathing, but in time we’ll add a few more 
pieces onto that. 
 
Room Zoom 
 
Igor: 
With that thought in mind, let’s do the next exercise. You’ve just done any 
room as a mentalization just to kind of warm up. What I’d like you to do now 
is go again to any room inside your mind, anyplace, and spend just a few 
moments there. Again point them out and show where they are, and then go 
anywhere else only – here’s the thing – be surprised by it. 
 
 
In other words, you can go to any other room you know but don’t choose 
which one it is. The only other thing I’m going to say about this is do not move 
there by any means you would normally be able to do physically.  
 
 
In other words, you’ll zoom in, you’ll teleport in or you’ll zap yourself there. I 
don’t care how you do it. It just has to be as close to instantaneous as possible 
and disconnected from the way you’d normally physically move. There will be 
no time lag. You’ll be in one room one moment and another room another 
moment. How you do that – well maybe you’ll find out in a moment. 
 
 
Once you’ve gone to the second room, you’ll stabilize it again by the 
pantomime pointing things out and describing it. Then go back to your 
integration breathing at the end and then come on back. That’s the whole 
little cycle. Do you all understand?

My preference now is that you do it on your own. If it helps you to work with 
a partner, by all means do so but the further we progress the better it is for 
you to do it on your own so that you’re independent with it, so you can do 
this anytime, anyplace, anywhere. Whenever you’re ready, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’m back on the sidewalk outside. I take a right and there should be a park 
out gallery on the corner. I’m walking by the charging station and at the next 
corner I’m going to go somewhere different and see where that will be, but 
I’m walking up the street and on my right-hand side is the penitentiary or 
whatever you want to call it. 
 
 
I’m by the ruins now, don’t really know how I got there. The ruins are a bit 
different than -  I think they’re thicker and higher and they’re suddenly made 
of more modern bricks. 
 
 
I guess I’m just going to stand by the wall for a while. There’s some urge to 
turn around. I did turn around. This huge tree is actually in the park. There is 
some kind of movement, something red on the far left. It isn’t really coming. I 
guess it’s about to take form and shape. 
 
Student: For now, let it go, it will come back later. Turn around and let it all go. 
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting?  
 
Arthur: 
I just have a quick question. I have had times where I’ve had actual visual 
hallucinations where I could see things, but in this particular case – in fact 
most of these mentalizations – I can’t see anything. I mean I know where 
everything is. I can describe it but I actually can’t see it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. 
 
Arthur: 
I’d like to know the difference between those two situations. 
 
Igor: 
Less conscious involvement. In other words, I suspect when you had a 
hallucination, you didn’t choose it on purpose consciously. It just kind of came 
up on you. Your unconscious mind surprised you with it. There goes that 
discovery thing again.

Now you’re specifically going hunting after it. We have a very delicate balance 
inside our mind. To make this work easy, fast, effective and powerful, we’re 
balancing between over-control on one side and letting go on the other side.  
 
 
If you let go too much, you have this amorphous, wispy, there’s not much 
going on and it’s hard to tell and it just keeps changing and so on. If you over-
control it, it will become rigid, static, dissatisfying and it sometimes even just 
disappears entirely because you’re blocking yourself. It’s the Law of Reverse 
Effect. 
 
 
Between those two extremes, you have ever more narrowing balance shall we 
say, but that balance is not a tightrope. It’s a little beam. At the one end edge 
of the balance point – so maybe it’s over-control – you will get some of it but 
not all of it.  
 
 
On the other side of the balance – on letting go too much – you’ll get some 
amorphousness or some haziness or things will shift unexpectedly, but mostly 
it stays stable. Then of course the closer you get to the center, the more 
realistic, more vivid and so on it becomes. 
 
 
All that tells me is that you’re probably trying a bit too hard and that’s okay. 
That’s just part of the learning process but provided you keep doing it and 
importantly maintain a benign attention about it and don’t get frustrated 
about not seeing things and so on, then that frustration is likely to create a 
more intense block because you’re adding on top of it.  
 
 
If your benign about it and say that’s fine, as long as I know where everything 
is and how it works, I’m good to go, then over a period of time that veil of 
consciousness will release as your unconscious and your conscious mind work 
out how to co-consciously mentalize them into the landscape. 
 
 
It’s just a fine tuning of that control mechanism. I know exactly where you’re 
coming from because I’ve had the same.  
 
Student: The continuing story – this time I decided to go back to when I was 16 in 
Venezuela, and I came out of the place where we were living in Venezuela. I 
turned the corner and I was like again in another place we were in, in 
Venezuela. 
 
Igor: 
Disconnected.

Student: Totally disconnected. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And then I started looking at that and then I was in another place and I kept 
jumping like that movie Jumpers. 
 
Igor: 
Two comments. One is well done. That was exactly the exercise. Two, make 
sure that if you’re jumping like that, you’re jumping on purpose. In other 
words, if the jump occurs without your volition, that’s going towards 
instability again. That’s letting go too much.  
 
 
You should only be jumping when you choose, when you decide it’s time to 
jump, or if you’ve asked your unconscious mind to show you something in 
particular or something important, and it has to take you to a certain place for 
you to be able to answer your question, shall we say. 
 
 
Other than that, you want to have enough control to determine it will be just 
be two jumps. If you keep jumping it’s fine. Just realize you have the opposite 
problem to Arthur. You’re letting go a bit too much and so your unconscious 
mind is taking over a bit too much. It’s liking the exercise probably and having 
a go that way.  
 
Student: The places were related. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. All memories are related. Sometimes you follow the affect bridge. 
There was a lady here a couple of days ago who was following the emotions. 
You may be following a memory trace in terms of fanatic memory. Other 
places are linked by location. Some places are linked by something as bizarre 
as color.  
 
 
That’s how memory traces work. There’s a thread that combines different 
types of memory according to that thread. So, I’m not surprised they were 
connected to each other. As far as the exercise goes, you did exactly the bit I 
needed you to do.  
 
 
 
The only thing I’m warning you of just so you understand where you are on 
this balancing point is you’re tending on a little bit more of the letting go side, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

so there’s a bit of instability there. To bring back the stability, just say no we’ll 
just have the two and I’m fine with that. 
 
 
Of course we’ll add more in time. Again, the English language is not ideal for 
this, but it’s a very nuance thing to be able to direct without forcing. You’re 
asking for things. I like the word evoking. When someone says this imagery is 
very evocative, what are they saying? 
 
 
They’re saying that when they look at it, it makes them feel things. It makes 
them think about things. In other words, they’re blaming the picture for their 
thoughts and feelings.  
 
 
Their thoughts and feelings are inside them. What’s really happened is 
something, some symbol within that picture let’s say, has sparked a train of 
association inside them and the unconscious mind likes it enough to bring the 
emotions and the ideas up. 
 
 
The same is true of music, for example. Music works for us because it does 
the same thing. It evokes usually an emotion. For people who are really into 
music, it can evoke whole landscapes and scenery.  
 
 
We want to take this idea of evoking scenery or evoking places, evoking 
symbols, because the unconscious mind is responsible for that but you’re still 
in control. For example, let’s take the idea of music, which is an artificial way 
of evoking things. 
 
 
You can always change the music and thereby change the emotions and 
scenery that you evoke with it. You can stop looking at one picture and look at 
another picture and thereby change what it evokes inside you, but those are 
artificial stimulants, a bit like sugar and caffeine and whatever because 
they’re external to you. 
 
 
It doesn’t mean it invalidates them. They have their place and their value as 
we saw yesterday. What I’d like you to be able to do – and this is what I’d like 
for you.  
 
 
If you choose to do this or not is entirely your choice but what I do for myself 
and what I would like for you to do be able to do is to evoke any kind of 
landscape, any kind of symbolic content within that landscape that is of value

to you no matter what is happening in the external landscape because that 
gives you ultimate control. 
 
 
Control isn’t I’m going to hold on so tightly my death grip is going to crush this 
pen. That’s what most people think control is about. Control isn’t letting it go 
and saying oh I haven’t got it.  
 
 
Control is something more like this. You don’t even think about it because 
you’re holding it enough for it not to escape, but not so hard that you’ll 
probably get arthritis by the time you’re 14. Do you understand what I’m 
saying? 
 
Student: Thank you, yes. 
 
Igor: 
I hope that was useful to you. I’m saying this not so much to you. It’s also for 
the rest of the group to understand because I want you to really understand 
this balance point – letting go, control and then somewhere in the middle 
you’ll meet at that sweet spot.  You have to keep doing these exercises to find 
where that sweet spot is. 
 
Student: Could you just go over a snapshot on what sort of musical mechanics would 
be if you feel like you’re flying off onto out of control, and if you’re too much 
control, how do you rebalance? 
 
Igor: 
So, how do you rebalance yourself when you’ve gone to one of the two 
extremes, right? The first thing to say is the progression we’ve gone up to so 
far is designed to teach you that.  
 
 
In other words, the first day or the mental tour of the house and so on is a 
very robust exercise, which means that even if you over-control it, it’s not so 
bad. Even if you under-control it, it will be more forgiving. It will be a little 
more unstable. 
 
 
Then yesterday of course the nuances came out of it more fully, and today of 
course they’ll be even more so. In the moment what can you do? If you’re 
over-controlling, the simple solution is to sit with it. Just be mindful of it. 
 
 
If you’re under-controlling – in other words you’re not evoking, you’re just 
letting go too much – sitting with it can be of value as well, especially whilst

you figure out what’s happening. It’s better to sit with it and let it continue 
being vague than to get frustrated.  
 
 
That’s the first thing, but then to counterbalance that, there are a couple of 
variations. You could insist – in other words take a little bit more control and 
say okay thank you very much for taking me there, but I want to go back to 
this place now. You’re re-evoking the original imagery.  
 
 
If you find it difficult doing that, that’s when exercises like the collecting a 
new landscape like we did yesterday are very useful because you’re using 
something that’s already stable – in this case a photograph, in the sense of 
this morning the actual walk you had around town to re-stabilize it. 
 
 
I’ll give you an example of this. When I was doing what I guess would be the 
alpha test or the beta test – in other words before I got my beta test group, I 
had to go through it myself.  
 
 
I was in Paraguay at the time and there was a square. I only saw the 
Parliament building, which of course I can see it very clearly now, but at the 
time it just kept escaping me. I could get all of the Parliament building and I’d 
get the square, and the trees jumped around and things were happening and 
so on. 
 
 
So, I spent an afternoon just sitting in the square. I sat on a bench on this end 
and I sat on a bench over here. I sat on a bench over there, and you can 
already see me making my mental tour through the whole place.  
 
 
Each time I just looked around, closed my eyes, mentalized, looked around, 
just very relaxed, and it started stabilizing more and more to the point where 
now I can happily walk around that little square, walk around the ring on the 
outside and walk around behind it and down the steps. There’s a nice big 
thing which looks like a ballroom, which is weird because it’s outdoors. It has 
two benches on either side and it looks across Castaneda, which is like an 
artificial lake there, but they’re very clear to me now because I spent time 
stabilizing it. 
 
 
Something in that process of learning to stabilize what was unstable let my 
mind click with oh here’s how we stabilize things in general. Don’t get me 
wrong. This is still a new practice for me also, so I’ll still under-control or over-
control from time to time.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

These are the solutions I use when that happens. If you can’t stabilize the 
actual imagery that you’re working with at that point in time, that’s okay. Be 
mindful of it and then go back to a different exercise to learn the principle of 
how to stabilize things, which really the first day was all about. 
 
 
Hence, this is a progressive process. The level one was day one. It was all 
about stabilization, so it was all about over-controlling but to keep things 
stable.  
 
 
Yesterday was all about letting go enough for some spontaneity. Today it’s 
going to be about the loose tie principle – how do you get control without 
going back to over-control. 
 
 
I appreciate that not all of you will be in the same place, so do your best as 
you can with it. Be mindful if it doesn’t quite work out and realize that if you 
go back and begin the progression all over again, it should automatically start 
fixing some of these issues.  
 
Student: In my case it’s just play nicely. You don’t want to be the kid who says I’m 
going to play bank heist. I’m going to be a police officer and you’re going to be 
the gangster. On the other hand, don’t play around with well let’s do this. This 
is also not playing nicely because your attitude is different. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. That’s a nice metaphor for this loose tie principle. You don’t want 
to be overbearing and you don’t want to be a wet fish cloth either who just 
gets walked all over. You need that fine middle point.  
 
 
Let’s face it. Aren’t those the people we like the best anyways – the ones that 
are confident without being overbearing and are pleasant enough without 
being just a pushover?  
 
 
Hopefully it will help your personality as well, whichever end of the spectrum 
you’ll be sitting on. Are there any other comments or questions on that? Did 
you enjoy the exercise?

Themed Scene 
 
Igor: 
So, we’re going to do something very similar again. We’re going back to this 
idea of evoking mentalizations. This time I’d like you to find three different 
landscapes.  
 
 
The difference between the version we’re going to be doing now and the one 
you just did a moment ago is that a moment ago you used your memory. In 
other words, you went to a place you knew and you went to another place 
that you knew; only you let your unconscious mind surprise you. It all worked 
reasonably well for you. Hands up if it did. Good. 
 
 
This time we’re going to go from a place you haven’t even thought of yet to 
another place you haven’t even thought of yet to another place you haven’t 
thought of yet. 
 
 
To make life easier for you – because that’s a very vague instruction – what I 
want you to do is ask your unconscious mind to give you a particular kind of 
landscape. For example, don’t ask for the type specifically, but say take me to 
a natural scene. 
 
 
One might be a forest. One might be a lake. One might be a mountain. You’ve 
given a theme, which is a natural scene. You may decide that you want an 
industrial scene or it might be a factory or a sign slab or something else. I find 
personally that natural scenes are the easiest for me to evoke. You may find 
differently. I don’t know. 
 
 
All I’m going to ask you to do is to set a theme and ask your unconscious mind 
to take you to another example of that theme. I would recommend you start 
with natural scenes. With all the people I’ve work with so far, they tend to be 
the easiest, but I’m not going to impose that on you because it might be 
different for you. Do you understand the nature of the exercise? 
 
Arthur: 
 Are these scenes that would be familiar to us that we would know about? 
 
Igor: 
First of all, the idea is to be spontaneous. In other words, you shouldn’t know 
what you’re entering until you’ve entered it. My personal preference when 
doing this exercise is to do the strange new world and come up with scenes 
I’ve never seen before. However, I’m not going to limit you to my practice. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
335 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
All that I care about is that you set a theme, which is a part of the control, and 
then your unconscious fills the content, and that you – we’ll call it teleporting 
for now but you don’t have to just teleport. You can zoom in. You can zap in.  
 
 
You can do it however you want to do it, but the point is that you very quickly 
in a split second switch from one scene of this type to a very different scene 
of the same type to a very different scene again of the same type. 
 
 
Essentially Larry just did through his memories in the last exercise. That’s 
what he described. But I want three iterations. Not five, not seven, just three. 
So, you’re setting the parameters to evoke and your unconscious mind is 
delivering the content. 
 
 
That’s really the co-conscious relationship there. Do you understand the 
nature of the exercise? All right, remember our practice starts with some kind 
of a mindful practice, the mentalization practice and then we’ll finish up with 
the integration breathing at the end. All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’m back outside on the sidewalk. I think I’m going to take a stroll around 
the block, but I know that after the first steps I’ll suddenly be somewhere 
else, but I’m going down to the art gallery and I’m looking through the 
windows. There’s some kind of exhibition going on.  
 
 
I go to the corner. I’m back in the scene from yesterday where I was walking 
on the surface of the tennis ball. It actually is the tennis ball and a red golf ball 
as the sun and the purple sky. In a moment I’ll suddenly be somewhere else. 
I’m excited to see where. 
 
 
It’s a forest. I’m standing very close to a tree, staring into the tree. There’s 
some kind of rabbit hole, an old rabbit watching me. I guess I’ll be somewhere 
else soon. I wonder where that will be. 
 
 
It’s my childhood playground. I’m by the swings. They’ve repainted the 
swings. I don’t know if this is the new color or the old one. The swings are 
moving but they’re empty. I’m going to sit for a while with the emotions I feel 
towards the empty swings and then I’ll reintegrate. I wonder what I haven’t 
learned yet on the swings that will take me even beyond. I’m going to bring 
myself back now.

Igor: 
How did that go? Was that interesting? What kind of experiences did you 
have? Did anyone actually leave enough to talk? 
 
Student: I had a completely weird experience. When I first closed my eyes, I couldn’t 
see anything except black and I just saw an eye looking at me. I thought I’d 
just go towards it and I went to the side and I ended up taking tour of my 
internal processes. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, wow.  
 
Student: So I saw what was going on. 
 
Igor: 
I love having people like you in the class because you’ve gone to the next 
session already. Well done. Honestly, this is very good. 
 
Student: It was really fascinating. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Excellent. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: This time I chose something that I thought would be a little more exciting, 
which is sci-fi. So, what happened was I found myself on another planet, and 
the distracting thoughts come in, like oh I wonder where I’ll go for lunch? 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here for a second. Again, can everyone hear her tone 
changing when she talks about the distracting thoughts? So, how did you cope 
with them? 
 
Student: I said that’s it. So, I told myself no, you’ll think of coming back to the exercise, 
but then again I don’t know if it’s over-control where I was on the planet and I 
said I wonder what they have for lunch here? 
 
Igor: 
So, your unconscious sneaked back in again, right? The question ‘I wonder 
what’ is actually a very useful question. Whether that’s over-controlling or 
not, I cannot answer for you because it depends on the emotional 
undercurrent that comes with it. 
 
 
It’s like I wonder what this is the lunch you’re having right now versus I 
wonder what lunch I’m having right now. It’s as though you’re not feeling

particularly in control of the mental process – the thoughts that come with it 
– and that’s something that your mindfulness practice will help with. 
 
 
Remember, mindfulness is another form of stabilizing. It builds more 
attention that you can channel where you want. Have you noticed that when 
you do your mindful breathing count, that afterwards when you just do your 
integration breathing, it’s very natural just to keep paying attention to your 
breathing without distracting thoughts coming in? 
 
 
Let’s do this very quickly. Would you all stand up for a moment please? Now 
this is going to be a little awkward from here. Those of you standing near a 
pillar or the wall will find it easier if you use the pillar or the wall.  
 
 
Otherwise what I want you to do is take one hand and grab your pants. If 
you’re wearing a skirt, don’t do this because you may expose yourself. 
Hopefully the material will be nice and strong. If you’re standing next to a 
wall, just put your arm against the wall. 
 
 
This is a kids’ game everyone’s probably played. I want you to try lifting your 
hand. Hold onto your pants and really lifting your arm all the way to the side, 
but of course it won’t lift because you’re holding onto something. Really 
struggle and strain. 
 
 
If you’re against the wall it’s easier because you just push against the wall, 
and really keep holding it, holding it, holding it. You should be struggling. You 
should be sweating at this point. You should be wanting me to stop talking so 
you can finally let go. 
 
 
Just keep holding it, holding it, holding it and then relax. Relax everything. You 
should notice the arm starting to lift. Do you feel this – the ghost arm effect? 
Let’s sit down and talk about what that means. 
 
 
This specifically relates to your question, by the way. So, what’s happened 
here? This is a childhood game that you may have played before. When 
you’re trying to lift the arm against resistance and you can’t move it, you’re 
hyper-stimulating the whole neurology involved in lifting the arm.  
 
 
That means your musculature and, importantly, the motor cortex – the things 
that move your arm and I think it’s the parietal lobes involved in there 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
338 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
somewhere as well – this whole area is being lifted up and because you’re 
putting a lot of strain and effort into it, it’s being lifted up a lot.  
 
 
Do you remember those old-fashioned TV sets that when you turned them off 
and watching for a while there was kind of this fading glow that continues for 
about a half an hour, and you just wonder how much radioactivity is entering 
your room?  
 
 
Your neurology works very similarly in the sense that when you’ve been trying 
to lift and trying to lift and you’re struggling to lift it – it actually works the 
same if you’ve been carrying heavy objects – your mind continues to want to 
follow up on the motion because it was so intense beforehand. 
 
 
In this case, your arm just wants to lift by itself and it feels like someone else 
is lifting it for you, doesn’t it? That’s why I call it the ghost arm effect. When 
you do your mindful breathing count and you go right up to the edge – if you 
lose track at six if you’re counting to five or four, you’re getting close to your 
edge – you’re doing the mental equivalent but with your breathing. 
 
 
So, when you go to your integration breathing, it just very naturally settles in 
your breath. That afterglow for people who meditate a lot can continue 
constantly. In other words, they’re constantly physically aware of themselves 
and whatever task that they’ve been engaging in, but it leaves no room for 
anything else. 
 
 
So, if you’re doing an intense practice of mentalization, your words will 
eventually drop out because your neurology is being activated that way. If you 
collect attention with your mindful breathing and then go into mentalization 
practice, then your inner dialog should also start quieting down because if 
there’s any spare attention left over, it will tend to go into for example 
following your breathing or being aware of your body. 
 
 
I like the body version – the physical movement – because when I’m aware of 
my body within the landscape I’m creating, and actually it puts me more in 
the landscape. I’m using now the picture of me last night. I can actually feel 
the slight sponginess of the ground where there are leaves there. 
 
 
I could pick up a leaf and my hands can almost feel the texture of them as I 
crumble one of the leaves and feel it falling between my fingers. So, by doing 
a physical practice like the squat – personally I like to do push-ups against the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
339 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
wall but we haven’t got enough wall for all of you – then it puts me more into 
the mentalization and there’s very little room left for my inner dialog. 
 
 
Those are two solutions there for you. The third solution is to hijack your 
inner dialog. If it’s going to be there anyways, make it do what you want it to. 
Hence, describe the scenery. 
 
 
If you’re describing the scenery, you’re using internal dialog and there’s 
nothing left to wonder about lunch. If you find that doing it just purely 
internally is still difficult because you have conflicting internal dialog, then 
verbalize it out loud. That will tend to override the internal dialog which is to 
the contrary. 
 
 
Of course if you need a little bit extra help, then maybe call up a friend on the 
phone and describe it for them. Don’t just call up and start talking because 
they’ll think you’re very weird. Tell them what you’re about to do. Play a 
game with them or something. That will stabilize it even further. 
 
 
Does that make sense to you? So, all you’re telling me really is that you have 
spare attention and that spare attention is going into habitual thought 
patterns, so you either take the spareness by increasing the difficulty or you 
hijack it by using that very problem – the internal dialog – to stabilize the 
imagery further. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you for that. What else happened? 
 
Student: What I noticed was that the anticipation of three new scenes stabilized 
everything else. I wasn’t trying to force to see all the details. I knew this would 
be just for a moment and I’d suddenly be somewhere else that helped me 
stabilize the environment I was in. 
 
Igor: 
Let me speak to that for a moment. Did you understand the point he was 
making? He’s played a mental trick on himself because he’s told himself I’ll 
only be here for a while. I’ll only be here for a short moment, so I don’t have 
to make a desperate effort to figure out what is all here, so he’s trying less, 
which means there’s less interference, so the scene’s more vivid for him.

Actually in the end, he could probably stay there longer than you would 
normally do because it’s kind of a mental trick to find that balance point. 
Because he hasn’t got to give an answer right now – it’s going to be only for a 
second – he’s gone from over-control to more balanced control and so the 
imagery stabilizes more vivid and so on as a result of it. Thank you. That’s a 
very good lesson to have learned. 
 
Student: I actually had the opposite effect.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, let’s have a look. 
 
Student: I was asking myself – so, I’m only staying here for a minute or so, so why make 
the effort? 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Can you hear the difference in tone? This is not like it’s a universal 
trick that you can all play on yourselves. It goes back to the benign attention. 
For him, the idea that he’s only going to be there for a moment takes the 
pressure off him, so his attention becomes more benign.  
 
 
For him, the fact that he’s only going to be there for a moment – I will mind 
read a bit – is sort of disappointing. It’s like oh shucks I’m going to play 
properly, so there’s a slight negative spin on it, so the pressure actually goes 
up, which means interference goes up as well. You could hear it in their tone 
of voice, could you not?  
 
Student: I think there’s more thinking involved, so more consciousness. 
 
Igor: 
This is why I can’t give you a general rule for all of you. What’s important is 
the balance point. So, you’ll know that when you’re doing this kind of exercise 
at home on your own or with friends that you’ll give yourself more time 
between teleporting. Just say I’ll be here for five minutes before I teleport. 
That gives you more time and, therefore, it will be more vivid.  
 
 
You on the other hand will take the pressure off by saying I’ll only be here for 
a few moments. When it’s vivid, you might hang out for a while and you might 
now. It’s your call. 
 
 
The timing here is a bit artificial because I have content to get through with 
you and so it’s not optimized to your pace, but then you get to take all this 
home again and over the next few months, years or maybe your lifetime, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
341 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
you’ll continue to hone this, refine this and practice it and find the way that 
works for you. 
 
 
I’m giving you general guidelines. You’ll have to practice these guidelines to 
find which of the nuances are the ones that your mind best responds to. Make 
sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I can’t remember where I was in the second place. 
 
Igor: 
Fine. 
 
Student: The first place I was at and then I flew to the next place – I know it was 
somewhere totally, totally different but I can’t remember what it was or 
where it was. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. The purpose of this exercise is not to remember something. It’s 
merely to have an experience. Whilst you were there, did you have a sense 
that you were having a decent experience and it was different? 
 
Student: Yes, it was perfect. 
 
Igor: 
That’s all that matters. What you’re starting to do now is you’re starting to 
enter a similar territory that you’re entering when you’re dreaming, and just 
the same way as when you wake up, the dream could be totally vivid and you 
wake up and as soon as you move an inch, it’s like oh damn it, but it was so 
clear a moment before, right? 
 
 
Because we’re engaging a similar mental circuitry, you may end up having 
that from time to time. Rest assured over time it should stabilize out so that 
you can recall what you’ve done, but even if that doesn’t happen the 
important bit is not recalling what occurred inside. The important part is what 
is the after effect?  
 
 
In other words, if you’ve gone on a healing journey, then have you resolved 
the issue that you wanted to resolve? If you’re trying to solve a problem, do 
you come out knowing what the solution is? If you’ve gone in to practice a 
skill or improve a skill, when you come out has that skill improved? Does that 
make sense?

The way I created the whole ASH Method, it was designed to be a practical 
tool. If you want to remember things more, then as you practice it just make 
that part of your intention, saying to your unconscious mind I want to get to 
the point where eventually I’ll remember all the stuff I’ve been doing as well. 
 
 
What will help immensely for that point is keeping a journal, a diary where 
you just jot down the experiences you’ve been having. The fact that you’re 
willing to write them down, even if there are gaps inside of it, tells your 
unconscious that you’re very serious about it, and you’ll tend to increase your 
recollection of it because you’re making an effort consciously now. 
 
 
I don’t bother with it because I’m not interested in that side of things. My 
interest is does it make my life better and that’s it. 
 
Student: It’s not that I can’t remember it, it’s just a strange phenomenon.  
 
Igor: 
It is, and I’m speaking to it less for you but just so the people here and the 
people at home understand the nuances of what we’re trying to do here too. 
Thank you. 
 
Student: After getting myself ready to do this, I just asked my conscious mind to take 
me somewhere interesting, and I found myself moving in a valley. The mist 
had settled and the mountaintops were clear and the pine trees were 
everywhere and very vivid colors.  
 
 
I stayed there for a little while and then I said take me somewhere else, I’m 
bored now, and the next thing I knew I was in a jungle and I was trying to get 
ants off me from the vines that were all around me.  
 
 
Again the colors were very, very vivid and the jungle was very jungle-ish. I said 
okay, come on, I’ve got to go somewhere else. Okay, let’s take you to the 
beach. So, it took me to the beach and I could see the cliffs and the houses on 
the cliffs and the sea crashing against the cliff walls. None of these places I’ve 
been before. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Perfect. That’s a textbook example of the exercise, absolutely. 
 
Student: Okay, good.

Student: I found the last two exercises difficult, what I thought versus what happened 
and what I thought should happen. So, when we did the one for being at a 
scene, I found myself at a pond full of swans and I gave a gift but the gift was 
candy corn. Then I remembered it’s real corn, so then when it gave me back a 
gift it gave me a golden egg. I was sitting there and I have it and I thought 
okay cool and I left. I said thank you, so I went back and the egg opened up.  
 
 
I thought something would be in the egg like a baby but when it opened it was 
golden light and being there I had a wave sort of sadness but relief came, and 
then some kind of tears. So, it wasn’t very instructive for what I thought 
versus what happened. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. That’s actually very, very useful. Did you find use in that? This is 
again where your conscious mind – or in this case your conscious mind – was 
about to interfere but you were still balanced enough – in other words you 
weren’t so invested in it – that instead of interfering, your unconscious mind 
said no here’s where we’re going. 
 
 
The more you do this practice, the more you’ll be able to get these nuances. 
We’re getting to a very nuance place now. Are you sensing this? It’s okay to 
fall off the wagon from time to time because you have lots of exercises to 
build back up to this.  
 
 
What’s important is that you find where that balance is for you, and it will be 
different for each one of you because you have different life experiences, 
expectations and so on. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: I had a different type of experience. I just told myself that we have to visit 
three places and starting with nature. Then immediately I walked into a place 
where I’ve never been before.  
 
 
It was a nice tranquil place and I was sitting there enjoying it, and then my 
mind tells me it’s a beautiful day, so I don’t want to go to sleep. He says fine, 
you want to go to another place. Immediately I was taken to the edge of a cliff 
and he says now you see, you wanted to see another place, it’s a beautiful 
place, I said there’s nothing here. There’s mist, mountains, a cliff and all I 
wanted was to move to another place. Next time I found myself on a beach 
and there’s this huge tsunami wave coming at me…

Igor: 
Thank you for that. That’s a great story. Again can you see the relationship 
forming here? It sounds like it was a playful kind of mini conflict, but this is 
why we have the benign attention. It says this is not good enough? Okay fine 
I’m going to give you something else. Oh, I don’t want that either. Fine, I’m 
going to give you exactly what you want. 
 
 
Do you see the more you can build that relationship where there’s a lot of 
trust and friendship and so on, the more accurately your unconscious will 
interpret your intention into something actually useful for you, and that’s why 
it’s very important to handle that relationship with yourself very carefully. 
 
 
One of the golden rules in terms of developing trust is always things like keep 
your promises. So, you keep your end and it has to keep its end, and the more 
you do it the more you’ll be able to evoke exactly what you want in exactly 
the way you want, but letting it go enough so that you can really do things 
that are wonderful for you, kind of like the golden egg opening up and giving 
her some sense of relief and so on. 
 
 
That’s a wonderful story – I appreciate that, thank you – and there were some 
valuable lessons from that, right?  
 
Student: I’m in a bit of a conflict, because first of all, being loyal for me is very high 
value. It’s actually so high that I think most of the things, if you’re not loyal is a 
waste of a lifetime. My unconscious made me the start to get to a very deep 
conflict that I’ve neglected for so long, and it was very clear, I understand of 
course this is a seminar and there isn’t enough time for everybody, but I feel 
that this is important. 
 
Igor: 
Would you like to do something with that? Close your eyes and go to the 
point of conflict but keep the mic up because we need to talk about this. So, 
are you at the point of conflict? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, now your turn is to make an agreement with the unconscious. In 
other words, say something along the lines of this conflict will be resolved and 
I will focus on it, and maybe even give a date for it, but I need to acquire some 
skills to be able to focus on that.

Now I will promise you that tomorrow you will learn what those skills are. I 
can’t promise you whether you’ll be good at them yet or not. I suspect you 
will be but I can’t make that promise.  
 
 
So, the deal you need to make with your unconscious is as soon as I have 
acquired and tested my skills to be able to resolve this kind of conflict 
sufficiently, we’ll come back and we’ll focus on that, but allow me to make 
sure that I don’t botch it up by developing the skills first and just see what 
happens. 
 
Student: I don’t see pictures but it’s a feeling, sort of a benigness there. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. In other words, the conflict you were getting into has been 
resolved. The loyalty issue is no longer a problem, is that correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Again thank you for bringing that up. Do you notice again that because 
we’re getting into something very profound and very unconscious within us, 
we need to manage that relationship with a great deal of respect, but respect 
goes both ways. 
 
 
Just like the lady yesterday who wasn’t ready to go into the black hole thing, 
you can’t be forced into it. By the same token, if it needs something from you, 
for example, to resolve or resolution of the conflict, it needs to know that 
you’re serious about dealing with it at some point too, so it’s a two-way 
street.  
 
 
That’s how agreements get made. If you were to externalize this conflict and 
pretend your unconscious was an actual person and you’re another person, 
isn’t this the way we healthfully resolve conflicts anyway?  
 
 
Like I know you need this from me. I don’t know how to do that yet but give 
me a couple of weeks. I’m currently learning the skill set for that and then I’ll 
come back and then I’ll fix it. Is that okay with you? Sure. 
 
 
That’s how we do relationships normally anyway, isn’t it? That’s one of the 
things you need to start applying to yourself because the more you do it, the 
more things will open up for you. Thank you. I really appreciate that.

Student: I’m finding that I always end up with everything trying to kill me. So, the first 
time I was flying above the land and I knew it was going to fall and it did, so I 
said okay I’ll just sit with it. I fell into the river. That turned into a different 
landscape, it was a mountain and I knew it was going to come spiking up, so I 
said okay and then he stopped the exercise. So, I don’t know what to do. I’ll 
sit with it and come out in a different place and try again and again and again. 
So, what do I do to stop it? 
 
Igor: 
Why would you want to? 
 
Student: Well, it’s a bit boring after a while. 
 
Igor: 
Let me put it this way to you. There’s another version of this exercise we 
haven’t done yet and we don’t have time for it right now – we’ll hopefully get 
onto it later – where you ask for a different kind of scene. Instead of saying a 
scene of nature, you ask for an emotional quality. 
 
 
It gave you what you asked for. You may consciously not appreciate it but 
that’s the problem. You know the benign attention part? Going with it was 
fantastic. That’s part of it but afterwards you’re now judging the experience 
and that’s of course taking away from it again. 
 
 
It’s that judgmental factor which is being tested, shall we say. Let’s put it this 
way. Let’s imagine I’m a 10-year-old boy and I’m living in a big house and I’ve 
upset the owner, so he’s kicking me out into the cold.  
 
 
I’m trying to get back in and I’m sneaking in the basement or whatever, and 
he’s trying to keep me out. Eventually he lets me back in again. Now at this 
point our relationship has been damaged.  
 
 
As I get back into the house, I’m going to go hide down in the coal bunker or 
something like that, and if that person calls me there’s no way I’m coming 
back in case he kicks me out again. This is normal standard psychology. This is 
very natural. You can all see that, right? 
 
 
So, now let’s say the owner of the house that kicked me out is feeling sorry 
and says let’s make up for it. Let’s say I gave him just a little bit of trust. I’m 
not going to give him a lot of trust yet because he just kicked me out in the 
cold and it was not very nice.

So, I’ll probably test him. I’ll maybe do something to annoy him, not 
necessarily on purpose – this happens unconsciously anyway – to see if I 
annoy him will he kick me out? 
 
 
As a rule of thumb the worse we’ve treated ourselves, the more we have to 
prove to ourselves that we didn’t really mean it and things will be different 
before the more pleasant scene will come through with it, so just go with it. 
 
 
I know someone who spent a month having dreams where they basically died 
in all kinds of just horrific ways. At first they were terrified to the point where 
they’d wake up in a cold sweat, and then it kind of got boring and then 
eventually they kind of started enjoying it. It was like wow, I never thought of 
dying that way. That’s amazing. 
 
 
When they got to that point, that’s when the dreams changed. Do you 
understand? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: So, just keep on dying then? 
 
Igor: 
Or not. 
 
Student: Okay, thank you. 
 
Igor: 
The point is as long as you don’t know what’s coming it doesn’t matter if it’s 
dying or not dying or whatever. We haven’t actually set out specifically to do 
something yet. The point is you’re still learning to navigate your internal 
environment. 
 
 
If you specifically don’t want to die, then say take me somewhere where I 
won’t die. Then maybe you’ll get a tsunami wave, which will wASH you away 
but you’re not dying. Who knows, right?  
 
 
This is the bit where the relationship starts coming in and the really important 
part is that judgmental factor. If you say this is not good enough, I don’t want 
this, I don’t like this, then you’ve popped out of equanimity. Even if it’s in 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

retrospect, you’re still projecting it back onto the experience, and that’s how 
we create problems for ourselves. 
 
 
Think of the example yesterday with those two people with the bird poop. It 
wasn’t the moment that got them terrified of birds. It’s all the subsequent 
thoughts about it that lay on top of the thing that started escalating in a bird 
phobia in case he got pooped on again. 
 
 
Because the day right afterwards they’d be fine. It’s a year or two afterwards 
when they’d built up enough negative charge in the experience – that’s when 
the phobia kicks in. I’m just pointing out to you where in the moment you did 
the exact right thing, but afterwards you kind of slipped into bad habits shall 
we say. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. All right, just one last question and then we’ll have a break 
because otherwise we’ll be here all day. 
 
Arthur: 
I went to three different areas. They were areas I knew and I found that in 
each of the areas I was associated with someone that I had spent a lot of time 
with in the past and then hadn’t seen in a very long time. 
 
 
During the integration period, that’s when I started realizing there was a 
common theme. They were three different people that I’d spent time with 
that I hadn’t seen. So, I thought that was interesting. 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly what the integration period is about. The integration period is 
allows the process to settle in. If you rush off, then there are things that are a 
little undone.  
 
 
Imagine going to watch a movie and leaving 10 minutes before the end, so 
you never know how it actually ends. It would feel incomplete. The 
integration period allows things to settle in, so they can complete. So, you 
have an experience but the experience itself is meaningless.  
 
 
You have to make meaning of that experience, and the integration period 
hopefully will help you to put enough positive spins on it that when you 
reflect back on the experience over time, the meaning will become overall 
benevolent as well. Thank you for that. I appreciate that.

DVD 10 – Advanced Mindfulness, Grounding 
& Having Profound Deep Trance Phenomena 
 
 
Mindful Warm-ups 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. Is everyone having a good time? Who found the morning 
sessions interesting so far? Again I want to remind you that as we’re 
progressing and things get a little bit more intricate, don’t take what you’re 
doing too seriously because you have simpler exercises in the last few days 
that you can go back to, to shore up certain skills and abilities and come back 
to these things. 
 
 
I want to introduce you to as many of these exercises as possible so that when 
you go home, you can take yourself through these things at your own rate 
and pace.  
 
 
As you know of course mindfulness practice is a very important part of this 
whole thing. It’s both a stabilizer by amping up your mental wattage. It allows 
you to collect more attention.  
 
 
It’s also your safety harness when you start meeting things that are more 
intense, less pleasant and would otherwise make you want to hide under the 
bed and cry like a school girl. It’s a great thing as a mental muscle that can 
cope with these sorts of things. 
 
 
You as a conscious mind get to decide whether you feel ready to handle a 
particular thing or not. The advantage of having a large group like this is that 
we get to see different minds reacting in different ways, and you get different 
nuances based on wherever they’ve either tripped up or whatever successes 
they’ve had and so on and I hope you’ve been paying attention to other 
people’s experiences and have learned from them.  
 
 
Would it be fair to say you’ve kind of learned from what other people have 
done as well, and it’s helped you in your own practice? Good. So, what I want 
to focus on now is some more mindfulness practice, and in particular how do 
you expand on it?

We’ve pretty much done most of the principles for mindfulness. There’s one 
more kind of mindfulness practice that will be useful to us, which we’ll come 
onto later on in this session, but before we get onto that I’d like to give you a 
sense of progression with mindfulness too. 
 
 
How are you going to practice this when you go home is a big question, right? 
Of course you’ll probably start off with just a minute or two, not because 
you’re going by clock time but because you’re going by task.  
 
 
Going by clock time is difficult because unless you have a very attuned inner 
clock, it doesn’t mean so much to you. You can develop that of course but 
that’s another skill. If you go by task, you know very clearly when you’ve 
completed it and it’s very simple to add onto tasks to elaborate on them. 
 
 
Your aim should be to make the tasks interesting and sophisticated enough so 
that you can do at least five minutes, but 20 or 30 minutes a day would be a 
really valuable practice in terms of building power. Five to 10 minutes is a very 
valuable practice in terms of maintaining the kind of state that you’re in. 
 
 
Of course if you can do more, feel free to do more. I’m not going to knock on 
your door and tell you you’ve been doing it too long. The good news about 
mindfulness is it can only benefit you.  
 
 
The only way that doing too much mindfulness might harm you is if you 
neglect your family in the process and get fired from your job and stuff like 
that, but the chances of that happening I think are slim to none, I hope. 
 
 
I’d like you to have an experience now of how to challenge yourself with the 
mindfulness stuff you’ve done already, and remember the core is that 
mindfulness count is you count to whatever number you can get to and then 
importantly afterwards you have the integration cycle, the integration 
breathing to let that attention you’ve built up do some good. 
 
 
If you want to intensify it, you of course start with a preview, some kind of 
intention that rehearses the mindfulness practice before you do it, and you 
end with a review, which will reinforce all the good work that you’ve done so 
far.

It’s a nice way of expanding the same practice and each one is a different kind 
of mindfulness, so by switching tasks the mindfulness again should have a 
higher level interest. 
 
 
So far this should be nothing new to you because that’s the stuff we did 
yesterday. Would that be fair to say? Here are some ways you can challenge 
yourself. 
 
 
Just in the same way as you could do a treasure hunt or play the Alphabet 
Game on the basic level that we did on the first day, you can do similar things 
with mindfulness to challenge yourself to greater heights, and I’d like to 
introduce you to some of those games now so that you can kind of play with 
them. 
 
 
The first one we’ll do is just very simply, just to get yourselves back in the flow 
of things, is start with the breath count and go to whatever your current 
number is and then do some integration breathing afterwards. Then we’ll 
come back.  
 
 
This is our warm-up piece, and then we’ll actually start the progression 
properly. Make sense? Whenever you’re ready, sit yourselves down and start 
your count. 
 
 
How was that? Pretty straightforward by now, right? Notice how a relatively 
long period has gone past a few minutes, and it actually seems 
straightforward compared to the first day. In other words, your skill – your 
mental muscle – is building. 
 
 
How many people got bored at any point within that? Two of you? For the 
rest of you it’s a good comfortable practice so far? Excellent. Remember, 
what’s boredom a sign of? Boredom is a sign that the task is too easy for you. 
The skill level required and the skill you have are mismatched. 
 
 
There are two ways to increase the difficulty. The first way I want to explore 
right now may not affect the boredom level right now, but we’ll see in a 
moment. The first way is: 
 
1. To exceed the count. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
352 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
In other words, if your count was five breaths, see if you can go to six or seven 
and so on. Just keep going. What I’d like to do now is the same process again, 
but I’d like you to keep going until you get to the point of failure.  
 
 
In other words, you get to the point where you lose a thread. When you 
suddenly realize that you’ve forgotten to pay attention, instead of coming 
back to your breathing, all I want you to do is ask yourself what is the last 
number I remember breathing? 
 
 
Let’s say that number is five. It may well be that you actually counted to seven 
but you forgot the last two numbers. That’s five. Five is that number. So, let’s 
just go to the point of failure, ask yourself what is the last number I remember 
breathing and then we’ll do the integration breathing at that point, knowing 
what that number is, and then we’ll come back, have a little chat and then 
we’ll add the next layer to the exercise. 
 
 
Right now, you’re just going to challenge yourself to go beyond the number 
you’ve got and you’re going to just keep going to the point of failure where 
your mind gets distracted.  
 
 
As soon as you remember that it’s happened, think back, find the new 
number, do your integration breathing, come back and we’ll have a chat, and 
then we’ll do a fun exercise. 
 
 
 
 Mindfulness 
 Warmup – Breath Count 
 Calibration – Breath Count To Failure 
 
 
Was that pretty straightforward? The point of breathing to failure is to test 
how much is your muscle growing? How much has your attention grown now? 
If you get stuck on the same number, you become complacent. 
 
 
In other words, you get stuck in the zone and started getting bored, and that’s 
going to be one way of finding out. The other way is just on regular intervals 
go to the point of failure and see how far further it takes you.  
 
 
Of course realize that it will change on day to day. If you have a really hectic 
crazy day, the number will probably come down. When you have a very 
peaceful calm day, the number will probably come up. So, you need to keep 
that in mind as well.

Personally I would not recommend that you go to the point of failure every 
single time you do this because then you’re practicing failure. The point of 
breathing to a failure is to find out where is my current level at? It’s just a 
sense of how can I challenge myself? 
 
Arthur: 
I don’t exactly understand because I don’t know what you mean by failure. 
 
Igor: 
I will demonstrate it out loud. I’ll speed it up just for the sake of speeding up. 
One, two, three… or a butterfly. What was I thinking about? Oh, I’m supposed 
to count my breath. Okay, what was it again – two or three? I’ll go with two. 
Two is the number. 
 
Arthur: 
I’m past 100. I mean I could have just kept going. 
 
Igor: 
Some people are very good at that. Hence, I said those of you who are better 
at that, come on back. The indefinite part of course is great because then you 
can carry on. This is just training wheels for people who are less used to it. 
Once you can do a half an hour or an hour of this sort of stuff, the number 
becomes irrelevant. 
 
 
Then you’re just paying attention to your breathing and you can drop the 
number portion, but I’m presuming that you’re not all expert meditators. 
Hence, we need to give you simple goal posts that will clarify what you’re 
trying to achieve. 
 
Arthur: 
That actually was one of the questions I had for you because I was wondering 
was there a specific purpose of counting because then instead of just focusing 
on your breathing, counting sort of inhibits focusing on your breathing.  
 
Igor: 
It’s a stabilizer in very much the same way as talking out loud and 
pantomiming. It’s a stabilizer for your mentalization and it’s training wheels. 
Once you can get to the count of 50 or 100 – in other words the numbers 
become meaningless at that point – then you can drop them away and just 
focus on your breathing, but most people give up before they get to that 
stage. 
 
 
So, instead of giving up, having a progression to build towards will make their 
life a lot easier. If you’re already there, a lot of this stuff will just be redundant 
for you. Just enjoy yourself. Just do your normal practice.

This is to show people how to build up to the level that you’re already at. The 
same is true for a number of things we’ll be doing here for the moment. This 
is getting us to a common ground. 
 
Student: I have a question, like if you could breathe redefine failure, because I can 
count my breath for a very long time but I can have thoughts at the same time 
I will not lose it. So, every time I’ll come back at the right time to count it. So 
basically could I breathe and then at the first thought stop? 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Exactly because I know some of your personal history. You’ve done 
a lot of meditation. So, what you’ve just asked is can I just add a nuance to it, 
an extra challenge to it to make it more interesting for me? Absolutely.  
 
 
For those of you beginning, I don’t recommend that because you may be 
adding too many extra challenges. Remember, these are all training wheels. 
The point of training wheels is to give you an objective that is reachable and if 
your objective is getting in the way, then you get rid of the objective. You just 
improve it. 
 
 
We can give you some ways of elaborating on the objective from this way. So, 
yes that’s a great way of adapting it. What I’d like to do now is to see if we can 
add some more challenges so that we can extend our period of mindfulness 
without getting into the trap of boredom because we’re being too repetitive. 
 
 
This goes back to the idea of playing games and having challenges. Who here 
found the counting really helped them to stabilize their attention and actually 
have something to do with this? That’s part of what it’s for. 
 
 
Once you get to a certain point, you can drop the counting and go to other 
things. You of course are now working with your thoughts as part of that 
because you’re now using that as your mechanism for it.  
 
 
What I want to introduce you to now is something I call pyramid reading. This 
is a way of cheating so that you get more meditation time in whilst still having 
that muscle relatively weak. 
 
 
Let’s assume you’re going to do five counts. It may be 10, 15 or 20 in reality, 
but let’s assume five as the number to demonstrate this with. There’s a way 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
355 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
of cheating to extend that practice significantly without having the mental 
muscle to do that. Would you like to know how to do that? 
 
 
It’s called pyramid breathing. Off you go.  
 
Pyramid Breathing 
 
Igor: 
So, you have all your numbers, right? Let’s for argument’s sake assume my 
number is five. So, I’m going to start at the bottom of the pyramid with one. 
I’ll speak it out loud so that you can all see it. 
 
 
One – I completed my first task. Eyes open or closed is up to you. Just make 
sure you don’t lose your balance. I’ll stand up very slowly. I’ll do one mindful 
movement just to change things around a bit. The next one is two. One, two. 
Then comes three, four and my target number of course is five because that 
was the last point of success I could remember. Does that make sense to you? 
 
Student: I would like to address the issue I’m having, because what you do very simply I 
cannot do at all. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. Once again, the key phrase is mindful movement. What that 
movement is, is irrelevant. The reason we used the chair squat here is 
because it’s easiest in this particular room to do it because we all have a chair 
and we can all stand and sit down. 
 
Student: Could you use an example for someone then who was in a wheelchair, or had 
a mobility problem? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. Absolutely. Any particular movement. Let me address this. Remember, 
what we’re looking for is a movement that’s under some form of pressure. 
The simplest thing to do is called dynamic tension, where you’re using your 
own musculature or isometric tension against each other. 
 
 
Here’s something I do for example in an airplane, where they might put me in 
plastic cuffs I keep getting up all the time and speaking to myself. On an 
airplane, especially because my back needs more of a workout as well, I’ll use 
a movement where I’m going a slight arch. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
356 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, I’m going to arch my back out. It’s kind of a stretch, if you like, but I’m 
actually tensing my muscle at the same time so that I’m slowly stretching into 
it. I’m going to tense my back up, arch my back through and then I curve 
around and then I’ll bring my arms into it. 
 
 
That releases a lot of tension in my spine on airplanes and people don’t think 
it’s too weird, plus because I’m moving with tension it does exactly the same 
thing as standing up and sitting down.  
 
 
This is not an exercise program. This is purely about mindful movement, 
which means we need some form of resistance, some simple movement you 
can accomplish with relative ease, but the resistance adds a level of difficulty 
and you can acclimatize.  
 
 
It doesn’t matter. My preference when doing this sort of work is I stand up, go 
to the wall and do a simple wall push-up normally. That’s because it’s the best 
thing for me to counteract the tendency I have to pass out, which my self-
hypnosis training has given me and I usually do this sort of work lying in bed, 
so it forces me to get up. 
 
 
It gets my upper body really engaged and I can sit down again and carry on. 
Does that help? You’re welcome to do it any way you wish. In here I’m going 
to encourage you just to do the chair squat just because you happen to have 
it handy here.  
 
 
If it’s difficult for you, by all means choose another motion. You’re just looking 
for some form of resistance for it. Do you understand the nature of pyramid 
breathing?  
 
 
You’ll start with one breath. You’ll do one mindful movement. You’ll go to two 
breaths, one mindful movement. Three breaths, one mindful movement. All 
the way to your target breath – in this case it will be five.  
 
 
You can choose to do a mindful movement or you can go straight into 
integration breathing. I don’t mind at that point. The only thing I want to add 
to that is if you find in your practice you’re getting more lost as the pyramid 
increases, add more mindful movements between each iteration. That will 
help clear your mind and really focus you again. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

That’s the only extra little tip. Do you all understand the nature of the 
practice? The mindful movement shakes things up a bit for you whilst keeping 
you in the same flow and then your count goes up. 
 
 
If you really want to challenge yourself – we won’t do this today – you can 
count back down again afterwards and it’s all within range of what your mind 
can do at that point. Do you all understand that? We’re only going to count 
upwards today. We’re not going to bother with the other side of the pyramid.  
 
 
We’re going to count up to your target number. Then just go to your 
integration breathing. If you are more experienced and your target number is 
more than 15, then please leave it at 15. Otherwise we won’t carry on with 
the course. This is a training exercise for you. Do you all understand the 
exercise? All right, off you go. 
 
 
If you haven’t done so already, start your integrating breathing now. Just 
pause it where you’re at. Go to your integration breathing for a little while 
and then come on back into the room please. 
 
 
First of all, how was that? Was that interesting? Notice how much longer your 
practice becomes without actually demanding more brain power from you. In 
other words, you can use your same mental strength but for more work and, 
therefore, achieve more entrainment than just having to stop and then do 
something else instead. 
 
 
So, it gives you choices. Do you want to do it for a longer time? Here’s a 
simple way of doing it whilst practicing success each time. Do you have less 
time? Well, then you just do a shorter version and just fit it in between things.  
So, over to you guys. Do you have any questions or comments? 
 
Student: I found it very interesting because you said that you can do other movements 
other than the up and down in the chair. Because I’ve been a proponent of 
dynamic tension for many years, I can now do a workout and do a month’s 
training at the same time.  
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. In fact, one of the guys in my beta test group is a fitness fanatic. 
He loves doing fitness work and he does calisthenics for it, which is a 
wonderful workout. He does both at the same time also.

The only difference is because he’s training for strength and this is very slow 
and is a time-consuming moment, he either has to do it the whole day to 
actually get a physical workout that will challenge him to physically grow 
strong, or he separates mental strength from physical strength. 
 
 
There’s a warm-up workout for mental strength and then when it comes to 
physical strength, he just ends up doing the more demanding physical work 
because he’s already got to the size that he needs to challenge himself 
further. That’s the only distinction I would put in there.  
 
 
Now let me just add something to this. Please feel free to experiment with 
this. There are two different versions of the whole tension exercise. There’s 
dynamic tension and there’s static tension. Static tension is something like 
you press your palms together and you push. That’s static tension. There’s no 
movement. 
 
 
What I want you to be aware of is how easy it is for you to sense your body as 
you’re doing this. Dynamic tension is exactly the same, only there’s 
movement involved.  
 
 
To use this example, let’s say you push this to the left and then you push this 
to the right. I just want you to be aware of your body and notice how easy it is 
to be aware of your body now. 
 
 
Whatever makes it easiest for you to sense your body, that’s the one for you 
to do because remember we’re doing this for metacognition. The whole point 
is the muscle that we’re developing is a meta-cognitive muscle. That’s the one 
that trains the GABA fibers and all the other stuff. 
 
 
If it makes your job easier to add motion or be more static, do the easier 
version because in terms of sensing your body, there’s the metacognition. 
You’re aware of your body’s sensations. That may be pleasant or unpleasant, 
but you’re benignly attending of course. 
 
 
Once it becomes easy doing one version – for me for example, I sense it 
better with dynamic tension – then switch to the other over time because it 
becomes more of a challenge again.

You’re just looking for different ways of adding challenge to the things that 
you’re doing. I’m really just giving you some ideas, some principles should I 
say, so that you can develop your own practice in any way you want. 
 
 
 
 A year from now I hope that if you all came together again and were to do 
some mindfulness practice together, it would look totally different because 
you all get to put into it what appeals to you and what starts you off on a 
success track in the first place, and then you can evolve it into more 
interesting territory for yourself. That you for that.  
 
Student: As I understood it either, the pyramid or the regular one, then get a 
mentalization and then the integration breathing. 
 
Igor: 
There’s no mentalization right now. We’re just doing mindfulness right now. 
 
Student: Correct, because I found it very easy to just get into some world after one 
count. 
 
Igor: 
I’m not even vaguely surprised because we’re building up attention. This is 
the whole mindfulness portion. We’re building up attention, which makes 
mentalization easy.  
 
 
The actual exercise – the pyramid breathing – was very simply if you’re 
number is five then you’ll count one breath, do one movement; count two 
breaths, do one movement; count three breaths, do one movement; four 
breaths, one movement; five breaths, integration breathing.  
 
 
There’s no need to do any mentalization for this segment because we’re just 
focusing specifically on the metacognitive function, the mindfulness training. 
If you then combine it with mentalizations, you’re basically building up a 
reservoir of attention, like the dam metaphor we used yesterday. 
 
 
You’re letting the dam fill up and when it’s full enough, then you release the 
valve in the direction of mentalizations and it will make it easy. Some of you 
will only need a little bit of water in the dam because you’re good enough at 
mentalizations that that’s enough attention for you to do work with. 
 
 
Others of you will have to fill the dam up more to make it easy or easier to 
mentalize. Does that make sense? You just have to find your own place within 
it. Thank you.

Student: So far the mindfulness seems like it accumulates over time. Is there any way 
to get it… 
 
Igor: 
Condense it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, just do more of it. You’re asking the same question as someone go to a 
trainer and saying how long will it take for me to look like Arnie? It depends 
on your physiology. Some bodies will build muscle faster than other bodies – a 
genetic advantage.  
 
 
It depends on where you’re starting. If you start off as a 100-pound weakling 
versus if you’re a 200-pound strong man, you’re already starting with 
different starting points and then your progression of course will be part of 
that as well. 
 
 
The key to getting stronger is to do more of it. Do more of it or with more 
resistance. By adding more resistance – in other words when the exercise 
becomes too simple, you add conditions to make it more difficult.  
 
 
That for example is what happened over here when he said I can count my 
breathing forever, but instead of counting my breathing what if I call it failure 
as soon as a thought comes in? Can I call that my point of failure?  
 
 
Then he’ll probably go down to five breaths from 100 breaths but that’s fine 
because he’s adding a layer of skill to it. In fact, that’s something we’re going 
to come onto in a moment.  
 
 
The harder you make it for yourself, the faster the mental muscle will build 
but the tradeoff is by making it harder for yourself, you’re more likely to de-
motivate yourself as well.  
 
 
If you’re the person that rises to challenges, who wants to be kicked in the 
mud and then say I’m going to do it anyways, then great. Make it as hard as 
possible for yourself and you’ll advance more quickly, but it will just be 
tougher and with my mindset personally I get de-motivated and I just 
wouldn’t do it.

Does that answer your question? You just increase the load basically. Are 
there any other questions or comments on that? 
 
Student: During integration, you just had to count breaths. 
 
Igor: 
No counting. You just let the mind do whatever it does. I will demonstrate out 
loud what I mean. I’m going to start with a mindful count and then I’ll go to 
integration breathing, so number one. I’m going to do it out loud so that you 
can see it. 
 
 
One, two, three. Other than my general awareness of this area, there’s very 
little else going on right now. That second portion was integration breathing. 
It’s simple. 
 
Student: The final integration? 
 
Igor: 
The final integration was at the end. That was it. I did three counting breaths 
and then I did about three integrated breaths, no counting. I just let my 
breathing do what it wants. I just let my attention do what it wants. It just 
tends to go towards the breathing. 
 
 
It’s very, very simple and it’s basically very much like the exercise we did 
earlier. The counting is the equivalent of pulling and pulling and pulling. You 
of course carry on breathing. There’s no in stopping.  
 
 
The integration breathing is the equivalent of letting go and then your body 
can do whatever it wants to do. Let your attention do whatever it wants to. 
Does that help? 
 
Student: Also, pay attention to what your body feels. 
 
Igor: 
You’re not paying any particular attention. 
 
Student:  Not any particular, you just kind of let it go. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. It’s kind of like this. When you let go of this, where does your 
attention naturally go? It naturally goes into the arm, right? I could think 
about my toes if I move my attention there but my attention wants to go to 
the arm, and that’s what the integration breathing does. You let it go where it 
wants to go, which will tend to be on the breathing. Thank you.

Are there any other questions? Very good. Is this useful so far? Good.  
 
Detailed Breathing 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s do the next bit. So far we’ve managed to basically cheat so that we 
can extend our time even if our mental muscle is not ready for it yet, which is 
good because we reinforce it. We get more practice at it. 
 
 
But then how do we do what you were asking about, which is how do we 
increase the intensity so that the muscle gets stronger, not just last longer? 
So, you have endurance training and you have strength training, and they 
don’t work the same way.  
 
 
With endurance training you need to endure, you need to increase time. With 
strength training you increase the load. Ideally you’ll do a bit of both – 
increasing time, increasing load, increasing time, increasing load. Stepwise 
you end up going to a much healthier place, both mentally and physically. It 
works both ways. 
 
 
How can we increase the load to this training so that you don’t get bored in 
the middle of it, so the boredom isn’t coming towards the end because in the 
middle of it it’s usually because you’re not doing enough inside of it and you 
have spare attention, and that attention is going towards things? 
 
 
To increase the load, you basically make your task more difficult. By that I 
don’t mean that you wear a tutu and stand on a tall building and try not to fall 
off whilst breathing. Think of it this way. Everyone just become aware of your 
breathing for a moment.  
 
 
Then just become aware of the breathing coming in and out of the nostrils. 
Then become aware of just the front bit of the nostrils, just where the outside 
part of the skin of the nostril is there.  
 
 
Then focus only on the lower half of that outside part of the skin of the 
nostrils and see if you can identify maybe is there a hair or just a little tiny 
corner of your nostril where the air is coming in and out. Bring yourselves 
back whenever you’re ready.

I suspect that some of you could do all versions of it. Some of you kind of said 
what? I can’t the difference between my whole nostril and half the nostril. I 
just can’t tell the difference. That basically tells you what the load is. If you 
have to pay attention to the whole gross movement of breathing – which is 
basically the general passage of air through your nostrils – that’s a big thing to 
pay attention to. It’s easier to grasp it. 
 
 
If you refine it and bring it down to something simpler – like for example just 
the front parts of your nostrils – that’s less awareness there. There’s less 
things to be aware of, so you have to put more attention on it to kind of 
magnify it. It’s kind of like a magnifying glass. 
 
 
If you’re only going to pay attention to one of the two nostrils, then that’s 
even less area, less neurons being activated so more attention has to go on it 
to intensify it, to magnify the sensation that’s going on. Do you see where 
we’re going with this? 
 
 
By making the task more difficult – in other words by choosing more subtle 
things to pay attention to – your load increases, which means it becomes 
more difficult. Then you have to just figure out through trial and error and 
experimenting what makes things more difficult for you.  
 
 
When I say difficult of course I mean what increases the challenge enough to 
be interesting again. For example, some of you might think I don’t care about 
my nostrils, that’s just boring. There you go. So what, right? Then maybe 
you’d want to pay attention to your ribcage rising and falling. 
 
 
If it’s your ribcage, that’s a big movement. So, what if it’s just the two ribs in 
the middle here? What if it just comes down to your sternum? What about 
just the point on the sternum? Can you make that point even smaller? 
 
 
Do you see how by refining it, more of your attention is required to be able to 
magnify the sensation enough for you to be aware of it? The level of 
refinement is irrelevant. What is important is that you’re increasing the load 
enough to maintain your interest. 
 
 
If you increase the load too much, you will generate disinterest through 
distress. You’ll get frustrated, angry or I can’t sense it. Those aren’t useful for 
you in this type of training. We’re trying to develop a skill at this point, so

we’re going to go back to something that you can succeed it relatively easily, 
and then incrementally build the thing up. 
 
 
Incidentally, another way of getting good at this quickly – this is the 
traditional Eastern method – is to make it so hard that you do get frustrated 
and you don’t sense certain things, and then you have to sit with the 
frustration so you’re already coping with that, but I have an easier exercise for 
you for that part. 
 
 
That’s the Eastern method. If you want to try that, go to a good passion 
retreat – 10 days of silence and just doing mindful breathing and the exercise 
we’re about to do in a moment – and it should be so easy but then every little 
ache, every little creak, suddenly you become aware of everything and 
distractions start multiplying. 
 
 
It’s a useful practice to do it that way. It’s just that after I left, I didn’t carry on 
with my training just because it was too hard. Whereas with this, I do and I’m 
incrementally better. I’m actually getting my reward because each time I get a 
little better, I say oh look I’m at the next level now. It’s just like a videogame. 
We build in the rewards. 
 
 
So, we’re going to try that now. Now we’re going to do – let’s call it the 
detailed breathing. Of course your point of failure will probably be earlier 
now than it was with just regular counting of your breathing, which is fine. It 
doesn’t matter. Just find out where is your point of failure on more detailed 
breathing and then come back. 
 
 
I will not choose for you what to do with it. You may in fact want to spend the 
first couple of breaths experimenting with different details to pay attention to 
until you find one that is subtle enough to be satisfying and yet still 
challenging. 
 
 
When you find that – whether it’s your belly moving, your chest moving, the 
sensation of air on your top lip or it could be as subtle as just feeling one little 
nostril hair moving – whatever that one is, just experiment until you find one 
that’s both satisfying and challenging. 
 
 
Then stick with that one and see how far your count will go until the point of 
failure. That’s basically increasing the load at that point. Do you all 
understand the exercise? In that case, whenever you’re ready, begin.

Arthur: 
Does it need to be a physical item that you’re paying attention to, or could 
you be counting backwards from 100 by three’s at the same time you’re 
keeping track of your breaths? 
 
Igor: 
It’s preferable if you do it on a physical item and here’s why. If you’re 
counting backwards by three’s from 100 whilst doing that, what you’re 
actually doing is splitting your attention. Half of your attention is involved on 
one task – counting backwards. The other half of your attention is involved in 
sensing your body. 
 
 
The point of the mindfulness breathing is to be aware of your awarenesses. 
Counting backwards doesn’t add anything to that. It adds nothing to 
metacognition. It just adds difficulty. It’s maybe an interesting party skill to be 
able to have but it doesn’t add.  
 
 
Hence, I would stick with something physical because again the skill you want 
to practice in mindfulness is metacognition, being aware of awareness itself, 
being aware of sensations, being aware of thoughts, being aware of 
movements, being aware of sounds and so on. 
 
 
Anytime that you’re aware of any kind of sensation where there are things 
you’re seeing, things that you’re hearing, things that you’re feeling, things 
that you’re thinking, you’re practicing some form of metacognition as long as 
it’s done with that benign attention, so you’re not getting involved in it. 
You’re just being aware of it. 
 
 
If you get sucked into it, you’re no longer practicing metacognition. You’re 
now in the experience and so no mindfulness is taking place. You’re just 
having an experience.  
 
 
If you add other experiences like counting backwards, that’s a mental task but 
it’s not adding to mental cognition because you’re not becoming aware of 
what is there. You’re putting something there to be aware of.  
 
Student: I do the – breathe a lot but I was a little blocked in my right nose or whatever, 
so I was focused on one hair. Unfortunately, I don’t think that you should do 
that. I mean most people I don’t think should focus on one side or the other 
because I actually got a little too focused on that, but then it settled down as I 
kept doing it.

Igor: 
Just to address that, remember we talked about experimenting to see what 
works for you. Seeing as we’re on that topic, you are of course aware that the 
right side of your body is run more or less by the left side of your brain and 
vice versa, right? 
 
 
So, if all your attention is on one side of the body exclusively, then there will 
be an imbalance in the brain because you’re basically activating neurology on 
only one side of your brain. If you find just focusing on one nostril for example 
distracting, then don’t do it anyways. 
 
 
If you are going to do it, then make sure that each time you practice you 
alternate so that you’re building both sides equally. Otherwise you’ll be the 
equivalent of a bodybuilder going to the gym, lifting only with his right arm so 
it’s stuck like this whilst there’s this puny arm over here. It’s like I can’t do 
much for that. 
 
Student: I only wanted to mention that. 
 
Igor: 
I think it’s a good point for people to be aware of. Are there any other things? 
 
Student: I don’t know if this is related. When I was concentrating on one nostril, 
immediately it was like my other nostril was trying to get attention, I guess to 
try to balance itself out. 
 
Igor: 
It may be. As I say, if it’s too distracting at this point, then do something else 
that works for you. Hence, I gave you a choice. Try out different versions of it. 
I personally prefer focusing on both at the same time, just less of them, and 
experiment. Just don’t do exclusively one side for the very danger that we’ve 
just discussed. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other comments or questions? 
 
Student: It might be because I’m changing my breathing, but what I found – the 
distraction for me wasn’t so much what was going on in my mind, but I found 
myself very spaced out. I felt myself disconnecting from my body, at which 
point I thought I’ll just go to my integration breathing now.

Igor: 
If you feel yourself disconnecting from your body or spacing out, then you’re 
no longer being mindful because where is your mind going? It’s an equivalent 
of someone having a thought about dinner, for example. It’s just only a 
different way. 
 
 
If you find yourself repeatedly disconnecting from your body like that, then 
mindful movement is the solution as far as I’m concerned. Technically 
breathing is mindful movement. It’s just very subtle movement.  
 
 
So, if you find that’s not challenging, then go to the more gross movements 
and then come back to the breathing side of things. There are other ways to 
increase the load. It doesn’t have to be just with the breathing. There are 
other ways to do that too. 
 
Student: I find out the more you decrease point of concentration, the more difficult to 
take breaths.  
 
Igor: 
You’re exactly right. That’s exactly the purpose. The more difficult it is, the 
stronger the load, the heavier the concentration has to be and so you’re 
building more muscle. You have to find the balance point. 
 
 
Remember this diagram right here? If the load is too high, you’ll get into some 
kind of stress or distress and that may be what happened to you. Your sense 
of spacing out and disconnecting might be in the way your mind coped with 
the task being too difficult. That might be part of it. 
 
 
If you’re getting bored and it’s just the task that you’re doing, just paying 
attention to a gross part of your breathing, it’s too easy and so it’s kind of 
boring your spare attention. 
 
 
The whole purpose of this little progression we’ve done here is for you to 
become sensitive to the fact that you can increase the difficulty by decreasing 
the area of focus, and then you have to figure out where am I going to focus 
that’s going to be pleasant for me – in other words it gives me good feedback 
– and how much do I focus – in other words what’s the constraint I’m going to 
put myself under?  
 
 
I don’t want to do too much because I’ll go into some kind of stress or 
distraction. I don’t want to do too little because I’ll get bored and distracted

through boredom. I want to get just like Goldilocks – just right. Are there any 
other comments or questions on this? 
 
Student: I’ve had a problem from day one with this breathing thing. Basically I get 
pretty bored very easily. One breath, two breaths – I’m thinking I can’t be 
asked for this. So, I thought I’d just go along with it everyone is doing it. Then 
when you suggested to take in something that’s challenging, I started realizing 
I can actually count my heartbeat. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: But the only trouble is my heartbeat beats really fast, so it’s one, two, three, 
four, five, six, seven. I’m trying to concentrate on the heartbeat and the 
breathing thing. So, I decided to just leave it, just concentrate on the 
heartbeat thing. 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you for a second? A simple way to make it easier to have a 
steady count with the heartbeat is to only count every other beat, for 
example, and that will slow it down again or you can do sets of every third or 
fourth one that I’ll count. You can still increase the interest factor of it. 
 
 
I really like this example by the way because I have absolutely no investment 
at all in you paying attention to your breathing. None. To me the only skill that 
you want to be practicing is metacognition. You can do it with physical 
movements. The mindful movement does exactly the same thing, just in a 
different way. 
 
 
The heartbeat is a wonderful one if you can sense it because as long as it 
keeps your interest, it’s easier for your attention to go there. At some point in 
the future, you may decide that you want to try it with the breathing or 
something else as well. That’s fine. 
 
 
All I care about is whether you’re engaging in metacognition. Is your mind 
aware of the way your mind’s working – in other words are you aware of 
thoughts, or are you aware of a sensation, or are you aware of a sound or 
something you’re seeing? That process is the one that builds the muscles. 
Please continue.

Student: Okay, basically I stuck with the heart beating thing, but what I notice was the 
less I concentrate, the less I can hear it. When I concentrate on it, I can really 
hear it loud.  
 
 
When I get to the integrative breathing part, that’s when I get really – 
because I start to think of something else and I have a very loud mind just 
jumping on things. My question is how do I stay in the flow because I just find 
the breathing thing just too boring? 
 
Igor: 
In terms of the integrative breathing, take that word away for you and just say 
to yourself just sit with it. Let me be you for a moment. I don’t have the same 
connection to my heartbeat but I’ll try anyways.  
 
 
So, I’ll pay attention to it for a little while. I’m going to count the heartbeats 
and then I’m going to decide okay I’ve done this enough. I’ve hit my target – 
whatever it was. Then all I do is I just kind of soften my attention a little bit 
and I just sit there.  
 
 
The interesting thing is I’m kind of aware overall of my body but it feels like 
my attention is leaning towards my heartbeat. It’s not as strong as with the 
breathing for me but I don’t have the same connection to the heartbeat.  
 
 
So, I’m just aware of it. I’m not trying to count. I’m not trying to do anything. 
I’m just aware of it and that’s enough. Yes, stray thoughts come in again but 
the irony is as long as I don’t engage with the thought, it kind of like zooms by 
like a car and then my attention kind of goes back towards that. Does that 
work for you? 
 
Student: So, the idea is just to always bring myself back to it. 
 
Igor: 
The integrated breathing is only breathing because you start with mindful 
breathing. If you’re not doing mindful breathing, the integrated breathing is 
irrelevant for you.  
 
 
The moment is just whatever your focus was on before, then you stop trying 
to do the focusing part and you just let your concentration just kind of 
become softer. There’s a tendency for it to naturally want to go there.

Let’s just use this example again. This is a form of mindfulness if you think 
about it. I can feel the muscles in my arm straining. When I release it, it wants 
to lift up.  
 
 
I can ignore that sensation and think about my left hand or right hand or 
dinner and so on, but there is a slight tendency for my mind to want to pay 
attention to the arm. I’m just going to allow that tendency to sit there and 
that’s enough. That’s all. Does that help you? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you so much for saying that because I would hate for people to have 
the sense that breathing is the only entrance to it. The skill that we are 
practicing is metacognition, it’s mindfulness, and it can be of anything. The 
breathing is the traditional one and a lot of people find it useful, but if it’s not 
useful for you or for you folks at home, then change it to something else. 
 
 
You already have of course the mindful movement as another alternative, and 
the heartbeat, if it works for you, perfect. Thank you. 
 
Student: I was actually getting quite upset when trying to do the mindful count to 
failure, because there was so much noise out there at that time. I found it 
impossible to do it. I was just like oh God, how is everyone else managing to 
concentrate? I count nothing as a breath here and there, and then I did find 
that the pyramid breathing was absolutely brilliant. That’s worked for me 
completely. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for saying that. Again, I’m trying to expose you to different 
methods, not because I’m invested in a particular method – I personally do 
the mindful breathing because it works for me – but because I want you to 
understand the principles behind the methods and then you find what works 
for you. 
 
 
I’m not going to push the boulder uphill. I’m going to start with the one that 
goes downhill first but when that’s no longer fun then I’ll start pushing 
boulders uphill again because my mind will be at a level where it can cope 
with that now. 
 
 
If you find yourself distracted in your daily life by noises, for example, then 
just go back to the hearing meditation. Remember that one, where you’re 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

listening to sounds or listening to pitches and frequencies or rhythms in the 
sound? 
 
 
That does the same thing again. You’re being mindful of a sensation. This time 
it’s an auditory sensation. Some people do mindful breathing by actually 
listening to their breath. They can hear the intake and outtake of their 
breathing. That works for them too. 
 
Student: I couldn’t hear anything. 
 
Igor: 
I understand. Well, you can hear them, so there’s a potential version of a 
meditation too. So, if you like premier breathing, by all means go for that but 
if everything is not working, whatever you’re being distracted by is your point 
of attention. I challenge anyone here to give me a distraction that does not 
have a point of attention, so just attend to it. Your mind’s already going there. 
Hijack it to start building mindfulness. 
 
 
Of course, over time as you get more experienced with it, you may specifically 
choose to do something other than what the distraction is kind of calling out 
to you in order to make that your challenge because it’s too easy to follow the 
distraction now. 
 
 
Then you might do something else but then you’re building a muscle. Now 
you’re getting into a routine and the core skill – which is the mindfulness or 
the metacognition – is still being practiced. That’s the key piece here as far as 
I’m concerned. Thank you for sharing that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: I want to ask if I did something wrong because in the last exercise instead of 
being mindful of my thoughts, I did the opposite. It seems there was some 
kind of background consciousness that’s just there, so I put my conscious 
attention to that background instead of from the background to the facts. 
 
Igor: 
In terms of the exercise, we were actually looking at the sensation of your 
nostrils and so on. You can do mindfulness equally by just observing your 
thoughts passing by without getting attached onto them and just letting go.  
 
 
If you’re paying attention to some semi-conscious awareness you have in the 
back of your mind, that’s still being mindful because it’s still something 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
372 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
happening with your mind. It’s still a sense of awareness and you’re being 
aware of the awareness. Meta cognition is still growing. 
 
 
Do you see how many ways you can do this now? You can do this whilst 
writing, painting, walking or talking. It can be done in pretty much any way. 
I’m not going to present to you a specific method you have to use.  
 
 
Of course for the sake of training, I’ve got to limit myself to certain methods. I 
want you to understand enough of them to realize this is what these are 
doing, and I can do the same thing in an environment that will be more useful 
to me and go for it. Thank you for that. 
 
The Body Scan 
 
Igor: 
All right, let’s now go to the next step. We’ve got a nice idea of how to extend 
your practice and how to intensify it so that your muscle gets stronger. Would 
that be fair to say?  
 
 
Just keep that as a principle in mind so that when you start getting bored with 
what you’re doing you can increase the intensity and you’re not stuck at this 
level. I’d like to introduce you now to another type of mindfulness training.  
 
 
This one in particular will be very useful for us in terms of the mentalization as 
well. It’s related to the mindful movement but it’s different. If you’re wearing 
glasses, you may want to take them off or you may just want to watch first of 
all and then do it. I’ll take my glasses off because it makes it easier for me. 
 
 
This is known as the body scan or some people call it the passion of 
meditation. The way we’re going to start with this is you’re going to take your 
hand – because you’re very used to sensing things with your hand – and I 
want you to place it somewhere on your body. 
 
 
We’re going to start systematically. I’m going to start on my forehead and I 
just want to sense my hand touching my forehead. It automatically pulls my 
attention to it. 
 
 
Once my attention is there, I can remove my hand but keep my attention on 
that sensation on the forehead because it’s very easy for me to be aware of 
that. Make sense?

Once I’ve done that, I’ll move to the next point. I’ll move up and maybe go up 
to the top part of the frontal lobe up here. I’ll remove the hand and then be 
aware of it again. Then I can go to the parietal lobe area, be aware of it for a 
while and so on. 
 
 
You can move all the way across your head, your face, your jaw, your throat. 
You can start doing your shoulders. It depends on your flexibility. You might 
be able to get your back or not get your back. It depends on how flexible you 
are. You can slowly start focusing on each part of your body. 
 
 
If that’s too tedious for you, you can do the same thing without a hand. You 
can just be aware of your forehead, the top of the head, the crown, the back 
of the head, one side, the other side, eyes, cheeks. I’m doing one draw across 
here, another draw across here. 
 
 
I’m just slowly scanning across my body and basically it’s the surface, the skin 
level of the body. You’re just scanning across it and being aware of the 
sensations that are there. Do you understand the nature of this? 
 
 
Whether you go for the really easy crutch approach where you touch to be 
aware of the sensation or you just do the mental scan, I don’t mind. Feel free 
to choose either. 
 
 
You may find that certain areas of the body are difficult for you to sense. For 
example, I find my back is sometimes difficult to sense, so then I have to move 
my hand there. I can sense it, I remove my hand and the sensation is there.  
 
 
Then I’ll move down a little bit and sense it and so on. Do you get the idea? 
The body scan will be of great value to us. You can either use body scans or 
mindful movements for achieving a particular thing, which we’ll talk about 
after we’ve done a few versions of this. If you have any questions about this 
exercise, now would be the time to ask.  
 
Student: Is it okay to mix like instead of touching every part and doing it… 
 
Igor: 
That’s what I do. I will tend to scan the areas that are weak. Those I touch. As 
soon as I get to an area where I can sense easily again, I’ll just scan through 
that.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

The touching part is just a way of becoming more aware of something that 
you’re less aware of currently. It just helps you connect to that part of your 
body. That’s really the reason I’ve shown it this way. I don’t expect you to 
touch your forehead now, but this is my forehead, this is my nose, this is my 
head. 
 
 
I guess kids would like that. By the way, kids aren’t just learning language at a 
time, are they? They’re also learning some form of metacognition at the same 
time. So, yes that’s exactly what I’d encourage you to do. Do you all 
understand the nature of the next exercise?  
 
 
I’m going to give you this one on a time-based thing. If you scan through your 
whole body and you finish, then start again. You can either go from the top to 
the bottom or the bottom to the top, or you can go up and down. Whichever 
way you want to do it is irrelevant. The point is that body awareness. 
Whenever you’re ready, close your eyes and begin. 
 
 
Most people tend to enjoy this. Some people really don’t like getting in touch 
with their body but most people tend to enjoy this. I’ll explain in a moment 
what’s important about this exercise but you all understand the idea of 
mindfulness. 
 
 
You have lots of different ways of being mindful. This is an extra feather in 
your cap. There’s a specific reason I’m doing this as well, which we’ll talk 
about shortly, but first over to you guys. What were your experiences? What 
kinds of questions do you have? 
 
Student: For those of you that don’t enjoy it, it’s a wonderful feeling. I don’t use the 
tactile side because I always have this vision of me coming out of water and 
the water level going down, just like an MRS would be the modern version, 
and it just scans everything down and it scans everything back up, and I use 
that in normal hypnosis as well for people to relax. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a very nice metaphor. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. 
 
Arthur: 
I just wondered how does this relate to for example if you tell your body to 
relax your feet, and you relax your… 
 
Igor: 
Oh, the progressive relaxation induction?  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Arthur: 
Is that similar? 
 
Igor: 
It is similar, so let’s just put that in context. For those of you who are not 
familiar, he’s referring to something that was done back in the 1940’s or 
1960’s called the Jacobson Relaxation Progressive Relaxation Method. So 
relaxation is a very healthy thing for the body and he basically decided that if 
you have people just squeeze their fist and relax it, squeeze their arm and 
relax it and so on, they can progressively relax each part of their body. 
 
 
Then he found that when people do this – they squeeze their fist and relax it, 
squeeze an arm and then relax and so on – after a while they didn’t have to 
do the squeezing anymore. They just focus on the arm and it relaxes. They 
focus on their shoulder and it relaxes. 
 
 
A lot of health benefits come out of physical relaxation. The difference purely 
in terms of whether or not you are relaxed is of no importance for this 
exercise.  
 
 
Of course if you want to add relaxation to it, that’s great, but the importance 
that we’re focusing on here is metacognition. The thing that the progressive 
relaxation method is focusing on is actually relaxation.  
 
 
For example, right now my spine is quite tense. I’ve been sitting up here in 
strange postures and so on, and I can still scan up and down my spine. I can 
be very aware of it but I don’t have to make any attempt to add relaxing it.  
 
 
My only purpose here is to be mindful of it. Who here feels more in their body 
right now, more kind of rooted, more present? It’s kind of the antidote to the 
problem you had before. That’s the importance of it. Does that help or do you 
have a follow-up? 
 
Arthur: 
Does that mean that if instead of doing this exercise, if you progressively relax 
your muscles, are you not doing metacognition? 
 
Igor: 
If you’re progressively relaxing your muscles, you are probably doing 
metacognition. You just have to be aware of them. For example, I can talk to 
you and just squeeze my muscle and relax it and not have much awareness of 
this and it will still relax physically, in which case I’ve succeeded with 
relaxation but I’ve failed with metacognition.

For the most part they go hand in hand. Most people will actively have to 
focus on the hand, squeeze it, relax it and be aware of the relaxation 
occurring. The awareness of the change of sensation is metacognition. Does 
that help? 
 
 
I’m just making it a level simpler for you right now for our purposes. If you 
want to add layers of difficulty like the relaxation element, by all means do so. 
The other thing that tends to happen with progressively relaxation – it’s not 
always the case but many people find that they’re relaxing so much that they 
space out and start falling asleep and go that way, which is again 
counterproductive for what we want in terms of metacognition. 
 
 
We want more awareness, not less. That’s why we’re not going down that 
particular road, but if you can keep the awareness and the relaxation, so 
much the better. You get a two-for-one there. 
 
Student: What you said about body scan, it put me in mind of the movie Elysium, and I 
found myself on that sort of healing bed or something and I think the light 
goes like that on the scan, but my light was going from head down to foot, 
foot back up to the head. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. 
 
Student: It felt like it was a warm light and it felt like heat going through my body. 
 
Igor: 
It’s similar to what he was doing here. If you think about it, all that’s 
happened is you’ve mixed metacognition with mentalization. It’s a powerful 
symbol that the unconscious obviously found attractive. Much like Arthur was 
asking about the health benefits of relaxation – can you do the two together? 
Absolutely.  
 
 
You can be relaxed and have metacognition. It’s just they don’t necessarily go 
hand in hand. It’s the same thing here. You can have this body scan 
symbolically do some very good things for you, but if you lose awareness 
whilst unconsciously you might still do the same work, you haven’t done 
metacognition. If that metaphor helps you, keep going. You’re just doing two 
things at the same time. 
 
Student: I also found it useful because I’ve tried that relaxation technique before to try 
to go sleep sometimes, where I’m like relaxing the muscles, but I always end

up falling asleep when I get to my knees or something. This scan, because it’s 
going down and up and down, it keeps your focus and it prevents you from 
falling asleep. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate that. Thanks for sharing that. What I like about what you guys are 
saying here is you’re beginning to understand what is the principle of what 
we’re trying to achieve? You’re not getting too attached to the actual method 
or the technique. 
 
 
 
The technique is just so we can have a shared vocabulary, but what your 
practice will end up being should be very different because we’re going to 
start off with what is easy for you to succeed at, and then when that gets 
boring you will add layers of challenge.  
 
 
I’ll talk a little bit about that in a moment before we go to lunch. So, I 
appreciate that. Thank you for that. Are there any other comments or 
questions on the exercise? Overall useful, yes? 
 
 
Let’s first talk about what you can do to increase the load on this in case you 
start getting bored with one version and you need that variety or more 
intensity to make it more interesting. 
 
 
So far we’ve done the body scan, focusing on the layer of skin. The reason I 
put the word ‘assisted’ in brackets there is because some of you will want 
some assistance to help get in touch with certain parts of the body or maybe 
you just enjoy doing all of your body this way. Either way is fine. 
 
 
Just as with the breathing we had two directions to go, we have several 
directions we can go with this. One is you can change your layer. For example, 
once you’re accustomed to going through the skin layer, the easiest one, then 
you could start focusing on the layer of muscle. Which muscles are working? 
 
 
That’s going to be for many people a little harder to get used to. Then the 
progressive relaxation will actually be quite useful. By tensing your muscle, 
you’re more aware of it and when you relax it you’re not focusing on the 
relaxation part. You’re just focusing on the fact that you can pay attention to 
your muscle.

Another layer that’s even more subtle than that – and most people don’t 
manage to do this straight off the bat, but once you’ve been working with 
other things it will get easier – is your organs. 
 
 
I think it was you who mentioned earlier on that you had a journey through 
your own eyeball. You can do eyeballs; you can do lungs, the heart, liver, 
kidneys, pancreas and all that sort of stuff. 
 
 
Another layer then is bones. That’s for a lot of people very hard to sense 
unless you’ve broken a bone or had a condition like arthritis that makes you 
more aware of bones and joints. We don’t tend to be aware of them but 
they’re there and they have sensation.  
 
 
Anyone who’s ever broken a bone knows that when cold weather comes, 
their bones ache. You know what a bone feels like at least when it’s not 
feeling so healthy. 
 
 
These are different layers you can go through and really whilst you may have 
other benefits from doing this kind of work, the main reason is so that you can 
challenge yourself. If one version of the body scan is getting too easy, you can 
challenge yourself with more subtlety so that you maintain your interest 
levels. 
 
 
So, you’re not thinking how quickly can I get to the bone level? Can I do it two 
weeks? Can I do it in five days? There is not some metaphysical advantage 
you’ll get out of it. It’s purely so that you have a regular progression to keep 
your interest level up. Does that make sense? Are there any questions so far? 
 
Student: It just occurred to me how about feeling your heartbeat go through as 
you’re… 
 
Igor: 
Yes, if you’re feeling reverberations from your heartbeat in other parts of your 
body, is it still metacognition? In other words, are you aware of some form of 
sensation? Whether it’s mental or physical, you’re still doing it, right? Do you 
get the idea? 
 
 
Another variation of this – and this is what the Buddhists like to do – is reduce 
the area. This is quite a big area to be aware of but it’s a lot easier. This is less. 
This is less. Can you do it at a pin prick?

The Buddha is said to have been so good at this that he could focus on 
individual atoms in his body. Whether that has become a mentalization or is 
an actual physical fact, I do not know, but for our purposes it’s not important 
because all he’s doing is he’s increasing the level of awareness or intensity 
each time, and the metacognition – that muscle that’s being built – is really an 
important muscle that we’re focusing on. 
 
 
Do you all have an idea of where to begin and places you can go with this to 
increase the interest level for you or the challenge for you if it starts getting 
too easy for you?  
 
Student: Can we do this through the nerves as well? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, the nervous system, absolutely. In fact, your nervous system is the one 
that does most of the feeling. 
 
Student: Because we can go to the brain… 
 
Igor: 
Oh, for sure. This is not meant to be an exclusive list. I’m just trying to give 
you sense of direction where you can go with things. Remember, what’s the 
rule of metacognition? If you’re aware of some form of awareness – whether 
it’s a thought or a feeling or a sound – you’re practicing metacognition. 
 
 
Initially you start with simple things because you can do them, but when you 
get bored with them you do more challenging things. If we were just focusing 
on metacognition of sound, we’d just listen to sounds like the bell ringing and 
someone opening the door and other sounds and I just jumped from sound to 
sound, but then that becomes boring because it’s easy. 
 
 
So, then I start listening to only the low frequency sounds. Although the bell’s 
going on, underneath it is this little rumble. I can hear a rumble. Then I get 
better and better at hearing things.  
 
 
Some people like to meditate to music because they’re doing this with the 
music. The skill we’re interested in is metacognition. We may as well talk 
about this now and we’ll address it more after the lunch break. 
 
 
How many people feel more inside their body now having done the body scan 
than before we started the exercise? That’s the reason. It’s more grounding. It 
has a grounding effect.

Remember, mentalization is more about being dislocated from this physical 
reality. How many of you when you were doing mentalization got so involved 
in it that when you actually came back to this room, you kind of got confused 
for a moment. It was like where am I? Oh, Dublin. That’s right. Hands up. 
That’s about a tenth of the group or something like that. 
 
 
The more you practice this of course, the more this dislocation phenomenon 
will occur because you get very good at being in your mental reality. It’s very 
important then that you have a mechanism for getting back.  
 
 
One of the people I did this with – the beta group with – I gave them an 
exercise. It was done more over time, so I gave him some exercises to do in 
between the sessions, and he came back after one of the sessions and he was 
a little freaked out because he a reality break.  
 
 
He came back, opened his eyes and he had no idea whether he was still in the 
meditation or not. Then he did some integration breathing but it didn’t quite 
feel right again. The body scan helped him to get back into his body again and 
be aware that this is the physical reality and he’s back in the right place. 
 
 
Another thing that you can do – which he ended having to do as well – is the 
mindful movement. He ended up going to the wall. I think he did 10 wall 
push-ups but very mindfully and very slowly, at the end of which it just kind of 
clicked and he said oh I’m good, I’m back, I’m fine. Because you’ll be going 
out, we want to have methods for coming back in again efficiently and 
effectively. Do you understand what I mean by that? You can do just the 
mindful movement. That will work just as well for you.  
 
 
Most people just like doing the body scan – or at least I like to do it the body 
scan because if I’m sitting at a restaurant just staring off doing my thing, I can 
just do my body scan. I don’t suddenly have to say oh the waiter’s here, take 
my order. It’s just a little less weird for me. 
 
 
That’s why I use the body scan but I don’t want you to get locked into this is 
the way you have to do it. The purpose of it is to get grounded, and that is 
what this seventh rule of Flight Club is: 
 
 Ground yourself at the end of each mentalization.

4. Respect

6. T… 
7. Ground  
 
 
The stronger your mentalization skill becomes, the more important having a 
grounding practice at the end will be for you.  
 
Arthur: 
So, in hypnosis after you’ve finished with a patient and you want to see 
whether they’re still hypnotized or not, you may have to ground them and 
you do that by giving them some water to drink. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, there are other grounding practices. Other kinds of grounding 
practice could be consuming food and drink, especially if the food is more rich 
– for example protein.  
 
 
I’ll give you an example. As I told you, I was on that passion retreat many 
years, and whilst this did not happen on my retreat, but at the end of it 
people kind of shared stories and so on. So, this had happened on a previous 
retreat that I wasn’t present on. 
 
 
One person who had been doing a little bit too much of the old flying type 
meditations was totally out of it, just disconnected and acting very weird. So, 
part of what they do to assist the meditation process is you cut down on food 
and you only eat vegetarian and like the food, keeps you less grounded. 
 
 
So, he decided to fast – the more advanced practitioner tends to fast because 
it takes you further – and he kind of lost the plot a little bit. So, the first thing 
that they did is the assistants took him, put him in a car, took him to a local 
restaurant and bought him a big fat steak.  
 
 
Halfway through his meal, he was like oh yeah, sorry about that folks. So, 
consuming things is also very grounding. Sometimes talking to people who are 
sane is very grounding.

Talking to people who have psychotic episodes in the middle of the psychotic 
episode can be a little less grounding. In fact, it has quite the opposite effect. 
So, you’re correct. Sometimes it might be something like a massage or a self-
massage. You know how you can massage your face and your hands?  
 
 
If you think about it this is just an everyday example of a body scan, isn’t it? 
To address your point, in hypnosis you sometimes see this with people who 
start going into a trance and are afraid of it, they will soothe to reground, so 
they can dispel the sensation of the trance taking effect. 
 
 
All right, let’s go have lunch.

DVD 11 – Transformational Training & Deep 
Trance Identification 
 
 
 
Igor: 
This morning when we were doing our mentalization practice, we learned 
how to teleport, how to move from one location to another very quickly. Who 
noticed that when you were doing that, it actually strangely became easier to 
do the strange new world and get an environment than when we were just 
doing the strange new world the other day? Good. 
 
 
There are a couple other things you can do with teleportation, which we may 
come onto or we may not. It’s less important. You’ve got the key idea. There’s 
something that happens within each mentalization, which is important for 
you to know first of all that it can happen and second of all learn how to. 
 
 
This is going to access a very important part of your neurology, which we’ll 
describe after you’ve had a few exercises. We’re going to start this process off 
slowly again with a quick warm-up first of all. I’d like you to do a mindful 
exercise, a brief one, just a minute or two just to get your brains settled, and 
then we’ll go onto the mentalization process again. 
 
 
Choose whatever you wish to do. I have no investment in it. Just make sure it 
only lasts a minute or two as a warm-up and then we’ll come back and we’ll 
do some mentalization. Off you go. 
 
Transformation Training 
 
Igor: 
This exercise is going to be similar but quite different to the collecting a 
landscape that we did yesterday. You may find it initially easier again to do 
this with a partner. You’re welcome to. You’re welcome to do it o your own as 
well.  
 
 
Choose if you want to do it with a partner – which will make it a little bit 
easier – or if you just want to do it on your own – which I think is still within 
your range of competency.

If you have a partner, you’re going to describe out loud to them, just as you 
did yesterday – what is the image – just very briefly; and if you’re doing it on 
your own, just describe it internally inside your own mind using inner dialog 
as though you were calling someone up on the phone and describing the 
picture. 
 
 
So, it starts off pretty much the same as what we did yesterday. Don’t take 
too long, just 30 or 40 seconds is fine. Just describe what you see there and 
then we’ll come on back. Off you go. 
 
 
So far it’s still easy, right? It’s really the same thing we did yesterday with a 
strange twist because there’s no landscape. It’s just an object so to speak. 
What I want you to do now is again describe it briefly in terms of technically 
there’s a leaf with water, there are some veins and that sort of stuff, but 
that’s just very brief just to get used to kind of get oriented. 
 
 
What I want you to do now is describe the mood of it as well, just like you did 
yesterday. What does it feel like looking at this photograph? What is the 
overall sensation of that? The mood or the emotions of it is the thing to focus 
on, and you only use descriptions around it as a way of getting yourself into 
the mood a bit more. Again only spend about a minute or so doing that so 
that we can get onto something much more interesting shortly. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: There’s a leaf of some kind. A big water drop in the center of the leaf and 
small water drops surrounding it. It’s a peaceful picture, a centered picture. 
The composition does make the picture peaceful. 
 
 
 
It’s a leaf with a big water drop on the middle with different shades of green. 
The object of the picture is in the center. The object is the big water drop. 
There are several other water drops around it. There’s a depth in the picture. 
 
Igor: 
All right, just settle down and come back to the front. I appreciate your 
working with me on this because this is an unusual exercise. We’re going to 
start off again with exactly the same things you started with. In other words, 
you’ll describe the scene generally. Don’t take too long on that.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Start describing the mood a little bit. Again this time you don’t need to take 
too long on that. That’s just to help you set your mental scene. The next thing 
I want you to do is answer the question how does the leaf feel in this picture? 
 
 
Once you’ve discussed that for a little while, ask yourself how does the drop 
of water feel? Then discuss that with the other person. Just give it two 
minutes, most of which you’ll be discussing how the leaf and then the drop of 
water feel. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: The leaf feels… 
  
Student:  Nurturing, offering itself to the support. Water, and also taking nourishment 
from it. Supporting and giving and the water, lit by the sun, held in place is…  
 
Student: The leaf feels like a fundament, a platform for others, yet it’s not annoyed 
feeling that at all. It’s satisfied with its function in the world. The water drops 
knows that their lifespan is a lot shorter than the leaf and they feel content 
with that as well. 
 
Student:  To be transformed. 
 
Igor: 
What was interesting about the exercise for you? Did you notice anything 
happening as you were making these different styles of description? This is 
the interactive part of the day, by the way. 
 
Student: My impression was that the leaf felt tickled by the water drops. Kind of like it 
wasn’t by them but maybe a little ticklish, and the water drop is like unstable 
and what’s happening next? 
 
Igor: 
Very good. The thing I want you to pay attention to is do you see the change 
in his physiology – his facial expressions, his body language and so on? What’s 
going on here? 
 
 
Something’s going on here that he gets to describe this in a way that is 
affecting him at some level that is something we don’t normally think about in 
everyday life. We’ll get into that specifically shortly, but first is there anything 
else you guys want to comment on in terms of your experiences here?

Student: In order to decide how the leaf felt about things and how the water drop felt 
about things, I actually put myself in the position of the leaf and the water 
drop. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you very much. Who else did that? Hands up. Congratulations. In order 
to be able to have a sense of how the leaf felt and how the water drop felt, 
she had to put herself into the position of the leaf or the position of the water 
and basically merge it all and become them at some level to be able to answer 
the question. 
 
 
Now you’ve hit the nail on the head. You all had to do that at some level. If 
you think about what you did, in order to be able to answer the question, you 
had to have the capacity to not be yourself long enough to be able to 
appreciate what it might feel like to be one of those objects. 
 
 
Here’s how it’s going to affect our mentalization practice. What I’d like you to 
do is spend about 10 or 20 seconds just describing it again – there’s a leaf, 
there’s the mood, the leaf feels this way, the drop feels that way – but choose 
one or the other, either the leaf or the droplet, to focus on. Don’t describe the 
other one now. 
 
 
 
Once you’ve spent about 10 or 20 seconds doing that – that’s just to get 
yourself in the right place – close your eyes and allow a landscape to appear 
where that exists.  
 
 
Once you have the landscape, whichever you chose to focus on, merge with it. 
Become the leaf, become the drop – that sounds so West Coast, doesn’t it – 
and have that as an experience and see if that helps you answer the question. 
 
 
Then unmerge, come back to yourself, and we’ll come back to the room and 
we’ll discuss that. Do you all understand the exercise? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Once again, you’ll spend 10 or 20 seconds setting the mood for yourself by 
describing the scene, describing the mood and describing how either the leaf 
or the water droplet feels. You get to pick whichever you prefer. 
 
 
Once that’s happened, you’ll close your eyes and you’ll mentalize a scene. I 
have like a farm scene with a fence here and so on and if I zoom in here, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
387 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
there’s a tree over here and there’s kind of a leaf coming out and there’s that 
drop of water right there. 
 
 
I’m going to choose the drop of water. I’m going to become the drop of water 
and I feel like a domey thing I can kind of see all around because it’s gets them 
crystal clear, and I have the sensation of resting on something. It’s actually a 
very comfortable, calming sort of thing. 
 
 
Then I’ll step back out of it. There’s the leaf. There’s the drop. The scene fades 
and I come back to myself. I just did the whole thing. It doesn’t take 
necessarily very long. Just move from different kinds of perceptions. Does that 
make sense? Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: There’s a picture of leaf with five water drops on it. It’s a peaceful photo. The 
leaf has channels in it that are yellow, the leaf is the platform and the reason 
that the droplets can survive. The leaf is in a forest, a rainforest. It has roots 
and is providing nurture to other creatures in the rainforest. 
 
Igor: 
Whenever you’ve had an interesting experience, come back to yourself and 
then come back to the room. Was that interesting? Did you enjoy that? What 
did you notice? What happened?  
 
Student: You said to think about the leaf and the droplets of water, so I thought that 
and then I said get into the leaf and move myself to a different place around 
with the leaf, and then I found that I will bond with the water’s rippling. 
 
Igor: 
Very nice. 
 
Student: And after I transformed myself into a locus and my both hands become two 
leaves. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And in one of the leaves I can feel cold drops of water on my hand. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. 
 
Student: Then I brought myself back.

Igor: 
Excellent. I love that. Did you all have similar experiences? How is he able to 
do that? What happens?  
 
Student: He’s tripping. 
 
Igor: 
He’s tripping, yes. He had a mushroom pizza at lunch. So, how do we 
understand what’s going on in the world around us? In particular, how can we 
be social beings? 
 
 
When you look at someone, you have to be able to tell how their life is going 
to respond to you? Are they happy? Are they sad? Is he going to hit me? Is he 
going to run away from me?  
 
 
You have various circuitries in your neurology to help you do that. The two I’m 
particularly interested in is: 
 
1. Your prefrontal cortex, which are the empathy circuits that allow you 
to read other people’s emotions. 
 
 
People who have got this part damaged are incapable of reading other 
people’s emotions. They don’t understand how that works. Related to that – 
and it may even be part of it, I’d have to look up if that’s actually true or not, I 
don’t know because I’m not going to make that as a claim – there’s a part of 
our neurology called the mirror neurons. 
 
 
How many of you have heard of that idea? What these mirror neurons do is 
whenever you see someone doing something purposeful – in other words 
when they’re pantomiming something or just play acting, it doesn’t engage – 
but as soon as they engage in some task, to some degree or another those 
mirror neurons activate. 
 
 
What they’re doing is they’re modeling what you’re seeing. In other words, a 
little mini version of them is happening inside of your brain so that you’re 
actually having the experience that they’re having, and that allows you to 
either understand their actions or be able to copy it or learn from it and so on. 
 
 
In order for him to become a lotus flower, he has to look at that scene and 
activate that set of circuitry for the emotional component, and sometimes 
even for the behavioral component, and he’s going to change his sense of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
389 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
neurology to fit his preconceptions about what a leaf is, what a water droplet 
is and so on. 
 
 
Do you understand the technical description we’re trying to get here? Don’t 
worry too much about the actual technical aspects of it. The upshot of it all is 
he can become the leaf with relative ease and give us a convincing 
performance of it. 
 
 
It’s convincing to us as opposed to say a dog because we are doing the same 
thing, so we can verify that what he said was correct, it fits. If he said he 
turned in the leaf floating on the pond and it was all smooth and everything 
was jagged and jumping around, and that jagged jumping around thing 
doesn’t fit because this image doesn’t trigger that inside you. 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? A very important skill when you’re 
doing mentalization is how do you become things? How do you become your 
own symbols? We’re going to explore this skill in much more detail 
throughout this session, but for now I’d like for you to just have experiences 
of this. 
 
Teleportation Transformation 
 
Igor: 
Do you remember the teleportation game we played earlier today? What I’d 
like for you to do is play it again. Just three scenes is fine and in each scene, I 
would like you to find some object.  
 
 
It can animate or inanimate. Inanimate is just fine for now – in fact maybe 
even preferable for the moment – some object to merge with, to become and 
the lotus flower or whatever it is. 
 
 
Get your experience of the same landscape from the point of view of that 
object – be it a rock, or a tree, a leaf or a drop. Once you have a sense of that, 
merge back to yourself and then go to the next scene. Find some object of 
interest, enter it, experience the same mentalization from that point of view, 
come back to yourself and so on. 
 
 
Do you get the idea of the exercise? Are there any questions on this so far? 
No? I appreciate this is a little unusual. Rest assured you’ll be very happy 
you’ve done this exercise when we start using this practically.

Student: I just didn’t get it. 
 
Igor: 
You didn’t get what? 
 
Student: The instruction. 
 
Igor: 
In the last exercise, you became the leaf, you became the drop and you had a 
sense of that, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. I’m asking you to do essentially the same thing. We’re just going to 
elaborate on the context of it. Step one is to find a scene, any natural scene. 
Your mind will take you somewhere, hopefully unexpected. Let’s say it’s a 
forest. 
 
 
So, I’m in a forest. There are lots of tall trees. It actually looks a little bit like 
that forest from one of the Star Wars movies – huge trees and stuff like that. 
So, seeing as it’s so big, I’m going to become one of the trees. 
 
 
So, I focus on a tree. I get a sense of the mood. I get a sense of how it would 
feel to be that tree, so I’m now going to enter the tree and become that. Now 
I’m going to sense the same forest but I’m actually the tree at this point, and I 
have sense of like my arm is getting branches, my hair is kind of the leafy 
forage on the top but I’m very up and everything is very low down. 
 
 
I see a little Igor down there. That’s nice. Now I’ve got a sense of the forest as 
a tree-like structure, so now I’m going to come back and reverse the position, 
go back to this Igor looking at this big tree in front of me and then the rest of 
the forest. That’s my first landscape. 
 
 
I’m going to teleport. I’m in water now. This is kind of a Caribbean beach with 
a blue/green ocean. Oh, there’s a hermit crab shell. It’s empty and that’s kind 
of caught my attention, so I’m going to focus on that. How does it feel? A little 
lonely. That’s good.  
 
 
Then I’m going to become that, so now I’m the shell. This is the shell. This is 
the opening which is empty right now. This is the body going through. There’s 
lots of sand.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
391 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Actually the sand is much larger and it looks kind of like little rocks and 
boulders around me but very square, very straight-edged things there. There’s 
a lot of water. It’s actually almost too much at that point.  
 
 
So, now I’m going to step back out again, and then there’s that little shell 
again. I’m myself watching it and here’s the scene again and then I’ll just 
come back to end it there. Do you understand the example? Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I just want you to practice stepping in and stepping out and perceiving things 
from an alternative point of view, and do that three times in three different 
scenes. I just did it twice just for the sake of speed. 
 
Student: Do I decide where I want to go? 
 
Igor: 
Don’t decide any decisions ahead of time. It’s just like the teleportation game. 
Just ask for a scene. I recommend a natural scene. I find it more agreeable. 
Once you’re in the scene, find something that attracts you. It was a tree for 
me in one. I didn’t choose that ahead of time. I just liked it. 
 
 
 
Then the shell was the other one in the next one. I could have been in the 
ocean. Do you see where I’m going with this? It doesn’t matter what it is as 
long as it attracts your attention. You’ll become that, have that point of view, 
return back to yourself and you’ll go to the next scene. This is a lot easier to 
do than to talk about. Believe me. 
Student Demo 
 
Student:  So, I guess I’m going to ask my unconscious mind to give me a landscape. I’m 
in Svalbard in the arctic. Snow everywhere, mountain tops, it’s an arctic 
desert. There’s a polar bear there looking to my left, his right. He’s looking at 
a marble. I’ll become the marble, I guess. 
 
 
The reason I couldn’t see one side of the polar bear is because that side was 
flesh and bones and not covered in fur. I’m stepping out of the marble and 
asking my unconscious mind to take me somewhere else. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
392 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
I’m looking at a palm tree from a frogs perspective. There’s a coconut up in 
the tree. I’ll become the coconut and apparently a coconut is afraid of heights, 
which I’m not. Interesting. There’s a frog on the ground with piercing eyes, 
interesting.  
 
 
I’ll step back and I’m watching the coconut. Now I’ll ask my unconscious mind 
to give me a new landscape. 
 
 
I’m in a bucket, a plastic bucket with water in it. It’s the marble again. I’ll 
become the marble. I can see the bucket around me, but there’s a lot outside 
the bucket. Stepping back, looking at the marble, it’s blue and red. I’m just 
going to sit for a moment with my new experiences. 
 
Igor: 
How was that? Was that interesting? I heard a few heavy sighs of like wow. 
Who didn’t expect what happened to have happened? Hands up. Just talk 
about it please. 
 
Student: It was a strange trip. I heard the accordion outside and it kind of threw me 
into Paris and there was a mime performing.  
 
Igor: 
Very good. 
 
Student: It caught my interest. 
 
Igor: 
So, just to recap, you heard the accordion outside and it zoomed you to Paris. 
Then a mime caught your interest and you became the mime. Is that right? 
 
Student: Well, it’s kind of interesting because at the same time I was watching him and 
was him, so I was… 
 
Igor: 
So, you had two perspectives. 
 
Student: Both through the inside and the outside. I was looking at other people and 
kind of laughing. So I said why the hell are they laughing? I’m really stuck in 
this box. Then I kind of zoomed out on a country road and there were 
crossroads, dirt roads going across and there was a rock right at the end of 
the intersection.

It’s a reddish boulder but further across and it became the rock. So, cars are 
coming through and I just see the dust and the bottoms of their tires but not 
the cars.  
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Did you expect it or did you plan oh if I’m a rock… 
 
Student: No, I was kind of surprised I was a human being, then into a rock and when I 
was the rock, I said here’s my buddy – the grass. 
 
Igor: 
I like that. 
 
Student: And then I just kind of sat there chilling out. I came out of it and then all the 
sudden I wound up on some beach. It was a long beach with a solitary palm 
with some coconuts on top. I said oh that’s neat. So, I became this palm that’s 
like 70 feet tall with coconuts for eyes. I looked around and I see the ocean. 
 
Igor: 
Very cool. 
 
Student: I see people sun tanning and the waves and then I came back out and back 
here. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Let me ask you this. In terms of just the pure creativity – although 
this is not a creativity exercise, this is building a skill which you will thank me 
for tomorrow – if someone had sat you down and said I want you to be very 
creative about how a coconut in like a person, would you even in a million 
years have thought about the coconut eyes and all that sort of stuff? 
 
Student: No. That’s just a total surprise. 
 
Igor: 
Was it hard or was it just effortless? 
 
Student: It just happened. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. This is very important. It’s effortless – which means it becomes 
unconscious, which just means that the value of the work is actually valuable. 
If you’re sitting there working out well it must be this and it must be that and 
it must be the other, you’re over-controlling again. Make sense?

Whereas if it just happens and, importantly, just happening matches logically 
afterwards the experience. A rock would literally just see tires going by and it 
would see dust coming by.  
 
 
It makes sense now but I wouldn’t even have thought of that before. That’s a 
very important point. I appreciate that. Thank you. Did you enjoy the 
exercise? 
 
Student: Yes, it was fun. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent.  
 
Student: I was trying to go into the desert and I saw a rattlesnake and a cactus plant. I 
was getting a little bit afraid of seeing that snake because it was pointed to 
me, but then I thought okay remember about the good feelings have 
protected me. 
 
 
So, I thought I’m not going into the snake, right? I’m going in to the plant. But 
I decided to go into the snake. It was just a movie in my mind, so let’s find out. 
So, it was a very intense experience to go into the body because the vision of 
the snake – it can see very far.  
 
 
I went out of it and then I went to an old cartoon that came to my mind from 
my childhood. It’s a little man who’s going to the moon in a rocket. So, the 
moon feels conscious and the guy who was going to the moon is a little bit 
unconscious. I went into the moon and it felt very relaxing.  
 
 
Then I went to the jungle and the Wizard of Oz was there with a big hat on. 
So, I went inside him and he felt powerful. So, I was looking all the way 
through the jungle with a nice feeling too, so it was quite a heavy experience 
for me to be honest.  
 
Igor: 
Importantly, it sounds like it’s just maybe almost like a children’s fairytale. 
Isn’t that kind of one of the ways things happened? What I’m interested in is 
particularly that intensity. Did you expect it to be that intense? 
 
Student: No. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
395 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
So, if you were just play acting or just making fun with kids, it would have 
been one thing. But the intensity just like the spontaneity tells you the 
unconscious mind is in action.  
 
 
If you think of intensity as a form of emotions, again we don’t generate 
intensity. We wish for it but it tends to happen on its own. Make sense? 
Thank you. I appreciate that. Was it valuable for you? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I started out on the moon and I sort of went okay this is powdery. I was on the 
moon and I was looking at the dust on the moon, and I found a rock and I 
became the rock and decided I was a sentinel on the moon checking out what 
would end up there. Then I moved to the next place and it was the sun. I’ve 
been to the sun twice today now but the sun was the only thing in the image, 
and so after sort of solidifying a little bit, I went okay I’ll be the sun.  
 
 
So, I popped into that and there was this wave of energy that burst all 
through my body. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: I went oh fuck. Then I dialed it down because that was too intense. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Again, let me just pause you here a second. I appreciate this story. You 
particularly now from an experiential point of view understand again the 
importance of the mindfulness practice now because that intensity – again 
mindfulness – shields you from being overwhelmed by it. It was totally 
unexpected, wasn’t it? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Once again do you see the unconscious mind in action here? Carry on. 
 
Student: So, after I turned off the sensation but I was still there, I kind of went well I’m 
not prepared to do this right now, so there’s no reason to stay. Then I went to 
the Alps and I became a snowflake.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
And that was much more calming for you, was it? 
 
Student: I started going it’s better to burn out than to fade away and then melt. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. Are there any other comments in terms of your 
experiences? 
 
Student: I had kind of an unsatisfying experience to begin with, and I thought to myself 
I shouldn’t think that. I should just go with what’s happening but I did want 
something to happen in my body. I wanted to have an experience in my body. 
 
 
The final thing that I saw was a stump of a tree that had been cut very badly. 
It was really rough. You could see the rings and it had been cut a while ago, so 
water and wind had eroded the soft tissue and there was something very 
lonely about this stump. 
 
Igor: 
Can you hear the emotion? Carry on. 
 
Student: And then there was kind of a branch that came out and I thought this is like a 
record. I could play myself. It just started going through the history of itself 
and that was it. That was really fabulous.  
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: I got to the feeling I wanted. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. I really like that particular example because you’ve just 
demonstrated once again at least the first five rules in action. Actually you’ve 
demonstrated all seven but we don’t know what the sixth one is yet, so you 
wouldn’t know about that yet. Thank you for that. 
 
 
Importantly, the transformation happened at the point where you decided 
I’m okay with the experiences I’ve had, and then your unconscious mind 
trusted you enough to do the next step.  
 
 
Do you see this pattern emerging over and over again? When people resist, 
then the persistence is not necessarily the problem. It’s the inability to access 
content as well.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

When they accept even the meager content, then other stuff comes out and it 
becomes surprising and positive and so on. Make sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: What I found most in this moment was the feeling of gratitude because when 
I felt the rock get inside me and that put the heat… all over me. A few 
moments ago I go to drop it. 
 
Igor: 
So, you had a sense of continuity going through rather than just being stuck in 
one place, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Notice how there are a lot of symbolic things going on within that 
that will be missed if you just walked through landscapes. There’s a deeper 
quality to that as a result of it. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. 
 
 
Whilst tomorrow you will be using it for a practical purpose, which I think 
you’ll really like, even on its own can you see the value for it? For example, 
let’s say you’re feeling a little bit lethargic. Being the sun at that point might 
actually do something valuable in terms of the energy levels.  
 
 
This is another way we can start using our unconscious mind or our mental 
landscapes in order to acquire qualities that are of value to us. We have the 
transformation of sadness into a form of joy and learning and self-expression. 
We have the sense of energy. We have the intensity of the experience. 
 
 
We can do all kinds of things with this but for the moment we need to first 
rehearse the skill so that it’s there for us when we need it. Do you have any 
questions about what we’ve done so far? No? 
 
 
In that case, let’s just describe the purpose of this next thing first and then will 
look into the content.  
 
 
 
Recommended Process For Mentalizations 
1. Mindful Movement 
2. Mentalization 
3. Grounding (Bodyscan) 
4. Integration Breathing (Sit)

This, I recommend to you, should be your general practice when you’re doing 
mentalizations.  
 
 
You start with some kind of mindful practice that helps you gather attention, 
which is going to be the fuel you’ll need to send you off on your journey. Then 
you’ll engage in whatever mentalization you have chosen for yourself in an 
exercise or for whatever purpose that you need it. 
 
 
When you finish, because you’re starting to get into more unusual and 
sometimes difficult territory, I’m going to ask you to make a routine of some 
kind of grounding practice. 
 
 
Remember we did the body scan before to make sure that you’re back and 
you’re not still a little bit of a sunshine or a little bit of a tree stump and so 
on? Make sure you ground it so that you’re back in this version of reality 
rather than the mental version of reality. Of course the body scan is just one 
example. If you recall the student I told you about before, he had to go and do 
wall push-ups as his grounding practice because he needed a bit more to get 
back to his sense of self. Make sense? 
 
 
Finally do the integration breathing again. That’s just the general learning 
phase. That’s the point at which consciously you get to let go, and 
unconsciously the learning takes place just like in the ghost arm. You’ve set 
the conditions for that already. 
 
 
That should be a very simple practice and if there were any lessons there that 
actually could turn into a nice acronym, I would use them but sadly there’s 
not. Do you understand the general process? 
 
 
By adding the idea of transformation into your seven rules of Flight Club, you 
now have a complete system for navigating your inner world.

You don’t have to transform every time you mentalize something but it is an 
additional option, just like you don’t have to teleport or anything like that. It’s 
an additional option that will help you get a different quality out of the 
experience that you would not otherwise get. 
 
 
Would you have gotten the same quality out of just watching the sun? Not 
necessarily. It becomes symbolically a way of saying to your unconscious mind 
I need a quality, whether it be energy or a conversion of thing to another and 
so on.  
 
Spontaneous Transformation 
 
Igor: 
So, in the next version all that we’re going to do is you’re basically going to do 
the same exercise again, only this time instead of choosing something to 
transform into, I’d like you to move through three or four landscapes and just 
be curious about whenever you enter your inner landscape will I become 
something in here. 
 
 
It may be and it may not be. Maybe in the next one or the one after that. In 
other words, instead of choosing I’m going to be the rock, I’m going to be the 
tree or I’m going to be the sun, just go somewhere, hang out there mindfully 
for a little while and if it begins to happen spontaneously, allow it to instead 
of refraining from now that you know what the overall sensation is. Do you 
get the idea? 
 
 
It’s a subtle point but hopefully you can start feeling that subtlety, which will 
be of great value to you when your unconscious mind wants to show you 
something of use to you? Do you understand the exercise of spontaneous 
transformation? 
 
Student: How many scenes? 
 
Igor: 
I’m not going to give you a specific number. I’d say do at least three and once 
you’ve got at least one transformation, it’s up to you if you want to continue 
or not. Keep going up to five or six if you want. It just depends on how fast 
you’re working.

I’ll pull you guys back when we’ve had a bit of time doing this. I won’t call you 
back too soon, so just keep going if you feel like it, but if you feel like you’ve 
had enough feel free to come back on your own. You have to start making a 
little bit of a decision on that one as well now. Okay, begin. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’m back on the sidewalk again. I wonder what the next landscape will be 
because this is boring. Let’s continue. The first thing I saw was white and black 
geometrical figures, and I realized when I would take a step back you see 
them up in that modern art. 
 
 
I wonder if I’m going to transform into something here or just change 
landscapes. Oh, I became the painting watching the visitors of the museum 
and the other paintings. The other paintings are older work. This is a newer 
painting I’m becoming. 
 
 
I guess I’ll step out of it and just look at the painting for a while before I 
change landscapes. So, now I’m back at the playground. There’s a red bucket 
there, a slide and swings. I wonder if I’m going to transform into something 
here or if I’m going to change scenery, change landscapes. 
 
 
Apparently I’m in a spider web, there’s a spider that’s kind of cartoony, a 
black widow. I wonder if I’m going to transform to something here. So, I’ve 
become the spider watching the fly that apparently – that’s what I was 
before. The spider isn’t hungry. I’ll step out of it and ask my unconscious mind 
to find me a new landscape. I’m just going to sit with the feeling I’ve got right 
now. 
 
Igor: 
How was that? Was that interesting? Who enjoyed that? Who had some 
surprising experiences? Let’s have a chat about that. 
 
Student: Well, on the third landscape I saw that black hole that I mentioned yesterday 
and before I had time to be afraid of it, I just became the hole. 
 
Igor: 
You became the hole, oh, wonderful. 
 
Student: Sorry, it’s my heartbeat. Anyway, I looked at myself being terrified of the hole. 
Initially I was thinking, how stupid. And I pitied her. I thought how can she be 
so stupid and be so afraid?  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
401 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Eventually I thought there must be a way of sort of reaching out my hand to 
her, trying to get her to be less afraid of me. I really felt sorry for her and I 
didn’t want her to be afraid of me anymore, but the more I reached out to her 
the more she sort backed off and I can’t get in touch with her, but now I see if 
from the other side. 
 
Igor: 
How do you feel about that? 
 
Student: It’s really a strange feeling because I can see how panic-stricken the other side 
was now, I mean right now I can see myself. I think although I might not 
sound like it, I am becoming quiet or I’m beginning to feel calm. I feel ever so 
sorry for the me on the other side. 
 
Igor: 
I see a couple of things here. Notice how the place you couldn’t reach in 
terms of the equanimity before, you’ve reached doing this. Are you beginning 
to get a sense of the value of this exercise?  
 
 
Importantly also notice how her equanimity, her benign attention a different 
quality. It was feeling sorry for it. It was compassion I guess is another way of 
putting it that allowed her to have that moment of transformation. 
 
 
I know that whole thing isn’t resolved yet but when is it more likely to get 
resolved – the way that you were feeling yesterday when interacting 
yesterday or the way you feel right now? 
 
Student: The way I feel right now providing I can get both together. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely and I understand that. We haven’t come to that yet. The point is 
you’ve just gone through a psychological maneuver that’s put you in the 
position where at least you have confidence that you can at least be capable 
of doing it, even though you don’t yet know how. 
 
 
You have all the pieces. You just have to put them together again. That will 
come tomorrow. 
 
Student: Funny enough I’ve got to be that black hole to be able to reach out, which is 
really weird. 
 
Igor: 
I know. Are you glad you did this? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
402 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Student: Yes, I never expected this to happen. I never expected that thing I was so very, 
very horrified of to actually reach out to me. 
 
Igor: 
I know. Do you understand the importance now of the first rule of Flight Club 
– to discover, don’t create? Could this possibly have happened if she decided 
I’m going to do this now? It wouldn’t be the same, right? You could fantasize 
or you could experience. Once again, on the first day we asked the question 
what’s the difference between a self-delusion and a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
That is the difference. 
 
 
The person that’s saying oh yeah, I did that, I visualized myself as a hole and  
they’re actually divorcing themselves from it. They’re creating a fantasy to be 
separate from that. By surprising yourself and having the strong emotions 
that come with it, that’s when you start hooking into in this case the shadow 
part of your personality where some very power things have been buried, and 
she managed to reclaim a part of that and she needs that part. 
 
 
 
That’s the dilemma I suspect, that you needed a part that was in the hole to 
get through the hole, so how could you be in that hole if it’s in there in the 
first place? Do you see where we’re going with this? Congratulations. Well 
done. 
 
Student: Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
What else did you guys experience? 
 
Student: I wanted to ask some classes I have had experience before and now also of a 
picture. I have had the same experience when I started to imagine something 
and I see a picture. I feel pain in my heart. I tried dealing with it but it’s not 
like I’m sad. It’s not like I’m something, but just feeling pain in heart. The 
more I think I tried to do in there, the more it became erased.  
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause here for a second. If I understand you correctly, there are 
certain things you might have done in the past or imagined. When you 
thought about those things you had a physical sensation in the heart. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
403 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
And then the more you tried to get rid of that pain, the more it remained. Is 
that what you said? 
 
Student: I don’t even right now these exercises – I didn’t try even to move. I tried to 
stay with it to see how it will be, but it’s continued to pain. The point is that I 
have had three visions. The first was very, very pleasant, very nice. The 
second was in the middle. Let’s say it was dark beautiful boat but completely 
in water and it was a little bit fear of sharks. 
 
 
Then I said I have all kinds of equipment and I put some kind of light to it and 
they became even friendlier. Next it was like I imagined like the Tower in 
Toronto and that was like so high in comparison to the other things. People 
inside and outside, all around and they started the pain. It’s not like anything 
possible. 
 
Igor: 
So, a couple of things. First of all what did that pain mean? How could I know? 
I’m not you. The experiences you had were great. Tomorrow when we come 
onto some of the healing things, you might be able to do some resolution 
about that.  
 
 
 
What I’m very happy about hearing is that when you were present with the 
pain, when you sat with it, when you were mindful of it you didn’t try to get 
rid of it. You didn’t try to heal it. Whether or not it resolves is not important.  
 
 
 
Remember, you’re either making things or worse. So, by not making things 
worse, by default they’re becoming better. Does that make sense? Just like 
with this lady over here when she had to go various iterations of meeting the 
black hole before at this point you got resource from it, you may have to 
revisit the same idea several times before you can start reclaiming a part of it. 
I don’t know. 
 
Student: I have had that before and sometimes I have hit and sometimes I feel it’s not. 
Even about the same subject. 
 
Igor: 
That’s basically your unconscious mind in action. I can’t say what it is. The 
point though is you did the right thing by not making it worse, and in time 
we’re still developing times. You’ll have a toolkit that you can apply 
specifically for whatever resolution comes.

Remember, as I said to you all on the first day, our first three days are training 
wheels. We’re developing skills to actually let us do the real work, which we’ll 
start tomorrow.  
 
 
There are two pieces. This piece and the bit we’ll do later on this afternoon 
are the two final pieces in the foundational model. Then we can start our 
work. Then we can start resolving things. Then we can start transforming 
ourselves as people and so on. Congratulations on the experience. 
 
Student: Thank you. Small question, extra for that because most people have some 
unpleasant feeling – let’s say we get some fears – but when I don’t get any 
unpleasant feeling but just physical sensation, what does it mean in the same 
situation? 
 
Igor: 
It’s the same thing. Your unconscious mind works in any one of your senses, 
so you might have the symbol that’s the picture. It might be a symbol that’s a 
physical sensation. It might be a symbol that’s a sound. 
 
 
Has anyone here heard sounds in their mentalizations, especially unexpected 
stuff? Did anyone have a taste or a smell? That’s a little rare but there you go. 
You have a whole bunch smells and tastes as well. 
 
 
So, it can come in any of your senses. Anything you’ve ever experienced in 
your life is fair game because your unconscious mind experienced it too and it 
can do that too. 
 
 
The interesting part is – and I think Werner can attest to this because we did 
this at the Ericksonian Hypnosis course – sometimes your unconscious mind 
can extrapolate from experiences you’ve had and create an experience you’ve 
never even conceived of having before. 
 
 
In Werner’s case he was seeing a color that because he’s blind of course he 
hadn’t ever seen before. He has some basic colors that he remembered from 
childhood, which he could see at the time. But then your unconscious mind 
created new colors for you. Is that correct, Werner? 
 
Werner: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The unconscious mind is very powerful and what we’ve been working so hard 
to do over the last two and a half days is to get access to that power. By the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
405 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
way, who feels that they’re starting to get close that, they have convincing 
experiences that they can start doing that? 
 
 
I understand not all of you will be able to do it in here because each one of us 
has to do a different level of mental weight training before we have access to 
all that, but you have a system for it now. 
 
 
Not tomorrow but probably on the final day, we’ll talk a little bit about how 
you progressively go through this system in your own time to know I’ll be 
working with this now and I’ll be working on that then and so on. Make 
sense? 
 
Student: Thank you very much. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate that.  
 
Student: Mine was really interesting because I ended up out in the desert and there 
was a little adobe house and I became a fly. I was just buzzing around 
frenetically, just buzzing around and then all the sudden this big fat sweaty 
man enters the picture and he’s swatting at me, and I’m frenetic and avoiding 
his fly swatter. 
 
 
Eventually, I get tired of that so I decide to go way up into the corner of the 
room and sit. Then of course I hear Eric over here mention something about a 
spider web, so I decided to land into the spider web. I thought isn’t this 
interesting. I’m stuck. I can’t move. 
 
 
But I wasn’t responding as a human. I was just this fly and I thought okay well 
I’ll just sit. The spider comes along and he’s wrapping me up and he’s up to 
my head now, and I figure okay well this is the end. He’s going to snuff me 
out. No big deal, right? So, before he snuffed me out I kind of laughed. 
 
Igor: 
Let must pause you here for a second. I’m really charmed to see you guys 
picking this up so quickly, how this attitude of equanimity is starting to seep 
into everything you’re doing. It’s like yeah no big deal, I’ll go with this. 
 
 
Whereas your initial reaction might be a sense of fear or of anger and so on. 
This is a wonderful thing because your neurology is spontaneously reacting to 
the situations you’d normally react to like danger and so on. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
406 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
By having a chance to practice the equanimity within these sets, you’re 
basically telling your whole neurology let’s be more relaxed in life in general. 
Out there these are all symbols as well because they’re just projections inside 
your mind anyways, so you get to be more calm and relaxed, which is not the 
same a sitting there and saying that you’ll never feel fear again. 
 
 
If someone puts a gun to your head, I’d feel fear at that. If I’m walking across 
the street and some crazy person is driving a bit too fast towards me, I’ll get a 
little fear and jump off the street, but those appropriate fears as opposed to 
most of the fears we carry around, which have no relevance at all to our 
physical survival. Thank you for that. Is there anything more you want to add 
to that? 
 
Student: Yes, actually it gets even better. 
 
Igor: 
Please carry on. 
 
Student: So, I’m snuffed out and I decide okay I’ll take a few integration breaths and 
just let whatever pop up because up until now I’ve been a little concerned 
about being over-controlling.  
 
 
Then all of the sudden I see this dark alley and zoom down and there’s this 
rotting carcass and I’m like God I’m a maggot. This is great. I’m in the thick of 
this goo, I’m well fed, everything’s like hunky-dory and the slime is great, the 
moisture is perfect. 
 
Igor: 
Allow me to pause you because this just priceless. I love this. This is a good 
sign that the unconscious mind is taking the exercise seriously. If I asked you 
guys to just imagine being a maggot, what would be most of your reactions?  
 
 
Whereas she’s given the absolutely appropriate response in exactly the way 
as he saw the wheels spontaneously in the dust, which you would have done. 
That’s the unconscious mind taking the transformation seriously. The maggot 
would be having that kind of response. 
 
 
Now whether clinically speaking that is correct, whether a snake can see long 
distances or a stone is capable of visual perception or a maggot actually 
perceives a rotting corpse in that particular way is not relevant. That is not the 
important point. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
407 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It’s that the unconscious is taking it seriously enough to let you fully 
experience and appreciate that symbolic transformation. Does that make 
sense? Please continue. I apologize for interrupting. 
 
Student: No problem. So, then I’m content and then all the sudden I realize I turn into 
something else and I pop out as a fly and I realize holy cow I just got reborn. 
 
Igor: 
Wow, it’s the whole circle of life thing. 
 
Student: Consciously I forgot that flies come from maggots. They do come from 
maggots, right? 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 
Student: But it’s not like I consciously knew that. I was kind of a surprise to me that I 
was reborn and that I realized I was reborn. 
 
Igor: 
All kinds of levels of symbolism there, isn’t there? Thank you for that. That’s 
awesome. Well done. Are there any other things you guys want to share? 
 
Student: So, this was my first experience of something bizarre in this mentalization. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. Give him a round of applause for that. 
 
Student: I had a few boring scenes I just didn’t like, so I thought okay let’s do 
something funny here. So, I was transported to a scene in the Wizard of Oz. I 
think I was one of the little men, just singing. I thought okay, what am I going 
to be now?  
 
 
So, I thought Dorothy, Glenda and out of nowhere I became the Wicked Witch 
of the East. I was dashing through on my broom teleporter going through and 
scaring everyone. I don’t know if you guys know the movie but she makes a 
really annoying sound, and it kept getting louder and louder and I was feeling 
it and just wrecking everything. 
 
 
I was really getting that yak, yak, yak sound. I started feeling the scene 
shaking because everything was shaking around me, and I willing myself to 
stop because I was worried that I might make the sound and embarrass 
myself. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
408 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
I kind of opened my eyes just to make sure I wasn’t going to make it and I 
wasn’t sure if I could stop myself. I seriously wasn’t sure whether it was real. I 
had to look around to make sure I didn’t actually make the sound, so nobody 
saw it. Now it’s really bizarre. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful and you just had a perfect example of this whole translocation 
thing we talked about. Did you guys enjoy the exercise? Are you getting a 
sense that the power of it is beginning to develop?  
 
 
Each one of you will have these kinds of moments on different exercises at 
different points in your life at different times, but if you keep practicing, 
eventually something like this or that will start happening to you. 
 
 
How many people had an experience of a similar magnitude at some point 
over the last few days? The more you practice this, the more your mind will 
get an excuse to suddenly go this is the one, now he’s ready to go for it. Do 
you get the idea? I appreciate that. Thank you so much. That was a wonderful 
example of it. 
 
 
We have time for another quick exercise if you want to do this. I’m going to 
do a slightly shorter version of what I was going to do, but we’ll make up for it 
other ways. 
 
Animal Transformation 
 
Igor: 
We’ve had the spontaneous transformations and who learned something 
from it. We’ve had the ability to step into a leaf and that kind of started the 
whole process off. 
 
 
Then the question is how can you use this for example to start acquiring 
qualities that will be of value to you but somehow are eluding you or maybe 
you need more of? 
 
 
I’m presenting this to you not as a technique but just as an idea of the kinds of 
things you can do with this to kind of get you started in thinking about what 
else you can do with this. This is one my favorite things to do. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
409 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
You have a choice. I like animals. I just seem to resonate that way. Notice how 
there’s a different emotional quality here and here and here and here and 
here. 
 
 
These are just scenes from life, aren’t they? This is a very bizarre one. The 
beauty of this is now you can either borrow through imagery or you can do it 
spontaneously. Either way, however, you’re unconscious mind can start 
feeling content like this in. 
 
 
So, which of these images overall do you guys like the most? I’ll leave one up 
here so you’ll have one experience of this. Hands up for the tiger. All right, 
hands up for the cat. Hands up for the owl. Oh, the owl seems to be quite 
popular here. The strange large creature? Only one. Squirrels are good. They 
climb trees. The pelican?  
 
 
 
All right, it seems to me so far that this is going to be the winner, so let’s bring 
this guy up. Just for amusement value, just to do it quickly, did you all 
remember to do your mindful practice to start with, then the mentalization 
and then grounding and sitting afterwards to let it all sort of settle in? 
 
 
You now know the method, which in terms of this picture here is you will 
describe it to yourself. You’ll describe a mood to yourself and then you’ll 
describe how it is feeling right now. That’s just a way of kind of attuning your 
unconscious to the content. 
 
 
Then at the end of it, step into it and enjoy yourself. You all understand the 
method already, right? Whenever you’re ready, off you go. 
 
 
How was that? Interesting? This is a very useful skill. Tomorrow it will really 
come into its own, but for the moment if all you learned was this on its own, 
it’s a really useful way of acquiring qualities, is it not?  
 
 
Hands up if you enjoyed the experience. Hands up if it was a little surprising – 
in other words some quality of it was not what you expected. Well done. 
Congratulations. Do you have any questions or comments for me before we 
have a break? 
 
Student: What seems to happen for all the exercises is I can get where I want to be 
very quickly but then instead of becoming the thing, I drag myself into it and I 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
410 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
start with kind of a housekeeping list, like I see what qualities that are 
available to me and which ones are not.  
 
 
For example, I became a nun and I did the full inspection first. So, it’s like my 
shoulders narrow and this thing is no fun. I can’t hold my phone. It’s like no 
shoes now. It’s like pretty amazing to me because I thought that I’m not such 
a hoarder, but it seems that I need to go through conveniences I get used to 
and I would imagine that it’s not as useful regarding the purpose of this 
exercise. 
 
Igor: 
Do you go into more slowly bit by bit? 
 
Student: No, instead of becoming a thing and living through her eyes and through her 
body, and I do that too, but I do a mental comparison of what I have now and 
what I got there. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. That can be a relatively natural thing. It’s just basically your mind 
trying to cope or adapt to what’s going on here. It might even be part of the 
control mechanism. Who knows? Like with most things, the solution to it is to 
sit with it. 
 
Student: I don’t object to it. I’m not saying oh damn, I won’t be able to do that but 
before I explore what’s happening, I need to like… 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. If you need to do it right now, then carry on doing it. It’s obviously 
working for you. In time don’t be surprised if you don’t need it anymore, in 
which case you probably won’t be doing it.  
 
 
My suspicion is if that’s the case, you’ll probably stop doing it long before 
you’ve realized you’ve stopped. That tends to be the way. By the way, just to 
show you what I mean, did anyone here start out on the first day where they 
couldn’t really see any images at all, specifically visual, and then somehow 
somewhere in the last three days pictures started popping up.  
 
 
You didn’t know how it happened. It just came out of nowhere. Hands up. It’s 
a very standard thing to happen. For those of you that that happened to, how 
many of you had the following experience. 
 
 
You couldn’t see any pictures at first but you kind of went with it. Eventually 
you realized you could see pictures but when you thought back on it, you’d 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
411 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
probably been seeing pictures for several exercises before that and you just 
weren’t aware of it. Would that kind of match your experience? Put your 
hands up. 
 
 
That’s exactly what happened to me. It’s the most bizarre thing. I know it 
sounds strange but initially I could not see pictures at all. After a while of 
working with visualizations and so on, I realized I could see pictures actually 
quite clearly and I’d been doing so for the last couple of weeks, only I had no 
idea I was seeing them whilst them I was seeing them. 
 
 
It’s a very strange experience to describe to people who haven’t gone through 
that, but basically it’s because I’ve been seeing them all along. It’s just the veil 
of consciousness was there.  
 
 
My conscious mind wasn’t allowed shall we say to be involved in it. By the 
time I got over whatever block that was, I had to succeed unconsciously first 
before my conscious could catch up. 
 
 If there’s one rule of thumb in terms of what you’ve been doing here 
all along, it’s your unconscious does it first and eventually your 
conscious mind catches up to the fact. 
 
 
Thank you for that. I appreciate that. Are there any other questions or 
comments before we have a break? 
 
Student: I just wanted to share a bit of a funny story. The picture resonated with me 
because we were on a family holiday in Tuscany and we were all asleep and 
this massive owl flew into the house that we staying in. So, I thought I’m going 
to become that owl and check out what that’s like. 
 
 
Then I remembered it perching on the windowsill at the top of the stairs and I 
saw my sister running into the bedroom where I was sleeping screaming 
Simon come here. Help. She’s like there’s something in the house.  
 
 
Then my father had came out and he was trying to get the owl onto a mop or 
something but it wasn’t happening. I just turned into that evil owl and I’m 
screaming and then I go and crap all over the table. Eventually my father 
caught the owl and put a big sack over it because it was very big, surprisingly 
big. I thought it would be a bit funny to share that.

Igor: 
Thank you for that. I appreciate that. Who’s kind of enjoying these journeys 
now? Isn’t it kind of fun?  
 
Student: So, it was kind of interesting. I became the owl and I could feel my body 
transforming into the owl. I was looking around and doing the actions of the 
owl’s head, didn’t quite do the 360 thing and I found I really like it, but what 
was more interesting was at some stage the owl just flew away and then I was 
doing the body scan afterwards and I got to my hands. 
 
 
I looked down and there was a feather in my hand and it was very, very clear 
and very, very vivid.  
 
Student: That’s one of the reasons we have the grounding practice because if you 
hadn’t done that – I mean will there be any harm it? Not necessarily but when 
start using this more practically, you want to make sure you bring back with 
you only what you want to bring back and not accidentally leave some 
symbolic transformation that won’t serve you in life.  
 
 
That’s one of the reasons for the grounding practice. It’s also for those of you 
to start translocating, so your body is in this room of course but your mind has 
completely gone somewhere else. It helps you to reintegrate back into your 
body as well, so there are lots of reasons for that. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I did become the owl and I had my eyes closed, and something happened 
outside and I thought I can see better with my eyes closed. Then I opened my 
eyes to see what had happened, and you had done something to your screen, 
so it changed image. 
 
Igor: 
So the quality of life was coming different. 
 
Student: Yes, but when I put my hands in front of my eyes to see what that would do, 
nothing happened. So, there was some other kind of perception happening. 
Maybe mirror neurons with my friend here. So, that was really amazing. 
 
 
Then the whole thing of the owl – the way the feathers are laid out around 
their eyes is actually a hearing device. So, I felt I was hearing cellularly on my 
body. It was really amazing. It was beautiful. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Thank you. It’s a powerful practice, isn’t it?

Student: It is, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, what we’re really doing here is these are all qualities that we 
posses but are somehow buried, either through social conditioning or through 
disuse and so on, and we’re starting to find them within ourselves again.  
 
 
Remember, the signal-to-noise ratio we talked about yesterday? You’re just 
letting your mind tune into different signals that normally are as treated as 
noise. Do you get the idea? 
 
Student: It seems like my unconscious hijacks every single exercise you offer. 
 
Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: When I finally managed, I just waited and said it didn’t really work and then I 
turned into the owl and I flew straight into a plane and died again. 
 
Igor: 
That will be your theme for a while, right? 
 
Student: Yes, the exercise before I got stabbed and I turned into the machine and 
stabbed myself. So it doesn’t matter what you offer. I seem to find something 
special. 
 
Igor: 
Here’s the thing. First of all congratulations to your unconscious for being so 
creative and persistent. Congratulations to you for just going with it with a 
sense of humor. Honestly that’s the best thing you can do because you are 
succeeding at every single exercise.  
 
 
It’s just your unconscious mind has obviously got another agenda on top of 
that and you might as well enjoy it. Who knows what it means. We’re not at 
that point yet. You may not find out on this seminar. You may have to go 
home and keep doing it for a while before it comes to you. 
 
Student: I found interesting ways to die. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Good for you. All right, let’s take a nice 15-minute break. Thank you 
very much

DVD 12 – Equanimity & Putting The Entire 
Beyond Self Hypnosis System Together 
 
 
Mentalization Warm-ups 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. How are you doing? We’re coming towards the tail end of day 
three. Does it feel like you’ve only been here for three days? We’ve covered a 
lot of ground, haven’t we? 
 
 
This is one last thing that I want to cover with you today, which will be the 
final skill in your foundational program, and then we can start looking at the 
practical applications. 
 
 
Of course I realize that many of you have already had some practical results. 
How many people have had a personal transformation just in the last few 
days? Hands up. How many of you were close to one and you know that if you 
just keep going this way, you’ll just have it spontaneously? 
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll start doing the practical stuff. It’s just the nature of the beast. 
Because we’re working with the unconscious mind and we’re doing it in a 
respectful way with the seven rules here, I expect that a positive 
transformation, a healing of some sort of will occur spontaneously because 
that’s the nature of a good relationship. 
 
 
 
Before we can dive into specifically seeking out things that we can resolve and 
have focus on how to do that, we need to have one last safety mechanism. 
We spent a lot of time on mindfulness and hopefully you appreciate the value 
of it in the sense that it builds your attention and also it helps build a lot of 
the mental architecture that’s going to be your safety harness if something 
unpleasant should happen. 
 
 
I want to introduce you to an exercise that will combine both your 
mentalization and your mindfulness training. Would that be of value to you? 
In particular if you put them together, if there’s only exercise you do out of all 
the things that you’re learning here, this one will probably take you the 
furthest in the whole of your life.

We’re going to start this up with a nice couple of rounds of warm-ups. Let’s 
start as we did everything before just with a minute or two of whatever 
mindfulness practice you wish. 
 
 
Remember, at the end of the mindfulness practice you’re going to have a few 
moments of the integration to just let things kind of hang out there. Whether 
it’s through integration breathing or just through a relaxed awareness, it’s up 
to you. So, just warm yourselves up. Do that and we’ll come back and start 
the progression slowly. 
 
 
The next step as we’ve done before is just a warm-up round, so we’ll make it 
easy for you. I’d like you to go into your mentalization practice. Remember, 
we’re going to go through this whole process of mindfulness, mentalization, 
grounding and then finishing up with an integration at some source. 
 
 
Go through a full cycle of practice. In the mentalization stage, let’s just go 
back to an exercise we did earlier today – the teleportation game. Just 
teleport through some random scenes. Just set the theme for it and see 
where it takes you.  
 
 
Go to maybe three or four places. The number is not too important. I’ll call 
you back when we’ve had a nice time to do that. I’d like you to go to at least 
places. Three or four would be better but see how much time you have for 
that. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m in a forest and I like that and I know I won’t be here for long. Now I’m on a 
beach. The color of the water is very intense and it changes all the time. I 
know that when I turn around I will be somewhere completely different. 
 
 
There’s some kind of factory. It’s quite dark and a lot of wheels turning. 
There’s a feeling here I’m curious of. I’ll sit with that for a while until I’m 
somewhere else. I’m suddenly a miniature of myself and a mountain made of 
red plastic. The mountain changes and turns into a castle. Everything is made 
out of red plastic. There’s a river blue oil paints leading up to a brush, an 
artist’s brush. He’s painting a self-portrait. 
 
Igor: Wherever you’re at, use your closing procedure. Who’s enjoying that? Is it 
starting to get easier again? The more you rehearse these things, the easier 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

they become. You should have lots of things you can do to fix the individual 
pieces along the way if you need to. 
 
 
If you understood me correctly, the exercise that you just did was something 
along the line of you set a theme – in other words scenes of nature, sci-fi, 
fantasy or whatever. You ask for a landscape and your unconscious mind 
takes you there. You have an interaction and then you teleport to another 
place of a different landscape but of a similar theme and so on.  
 
Mood Themes 
 
Igor: What I’d like you to do now is the same exercise again, only I would like you 
to change the nature of the theme. The theme I’d like you to ask for is – let’s 
go general first and then we’ll get specific after.  
 
 
I’d like for you to ask generally for a positive experience – in other words a 
landscape that will make you feel somehow positive and you don’t know what 
that is. It could be excitement. It could be calm. It could be anything.  
 
 
Rather than the theme being something substantive in the sense of trees, or 
nature or building or whatever, your theme is going to be qualitative in the 
sense of the mood or the experience that can be had there, which means you 
might stay with nature, you might go from nature to a city to a space station 
or to whatever. It doesn’t really matter.  
 
 
However the theme in terms of the mood will continue to be positive. Do you 
get the idea? Are there any questions on that exercise? No? It’s the same 
thing as before. We’ll start with mindfulness practice, the mentalization; we’ll 
be teleporting on a theme and the theme being a positive mood. 
 
 
Then we’ll go back to the grounding and integration practice at the end. As 
before, go to at least two places. Four or five would be ideal but go for at least 
two. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I want to be in a forest now that has a positive impact. It’s a forest of 
candy. There’s a red house, snow or sugar. I wonder what the next positive 
forest will be. This is an actual forest I’ve been to in Cambodia, it’s a positive

417 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
experience. There’s a fox’s tail, a red tail. I wonder what that means or what it 
wants me to do with it. I’m just going to sit with that.  
 
 
I wonder what the next positive landscape experience will be. This is another 
forest I’ve been to as a kid, playing with my friends. It’s dark and it should be 
frightening, but it isn’t. It’s still a positive experience. The trees are huge and 
there’s that tail again. I wonder what would happen if I transform into that 
object? I can see a weird version of myself, kind of a combo between me as a 
kid and me today. It’s still a positive experience. I think I’ll become myself 
now. 
 
Igor: 
Was that fun? That’s one of my favorite exercises. I like this one a lot, so I 
joined you. Share what kind of experiences you had or if there are any 
insights. 
 
Student: I found myself in a restaurant eating delicious spaghetti. It was like well that’s 
great. I love spaghetti. Of course two men came in with black masks and shot 
me. I was a bit surprised because I said well it has to be positive, so I was lying 
on the ground dead looking around, and I realized that I saw the scene as 
clear as I ever did before and I was really happy. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. Give her a round of applause. Awesome. Well done. Here’s 
the interesting part. Who says that death has to be a bad thing? We associate 
that. That’s something we’ve learned culturally and so on, and believe me I 
don’t want to die either, but the interesting thing is, especially with the 
landscape, with the mentalizations, you’re beginning to have more freedom 
of choice. You can die and still be really happy. Isn’t that weird?  
 
Student: That’s great. 
 
Igor: 
Isn’t it? Congratulations. Well done. What other kind of experiences did you 
guys have? 
 
Student: Igor, at the moment I have a little bit of confusion. Everything I discover, my 
subconscious discovered. I have a very creative mind. I always have.  
 
Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: As soon as I go to discover any scenery, I have to create my own version inside 
that discovery.

Igor: 
How do you mean? 
 
Student: For example, if I’d gone to the rose garden, suddenly I start to organize how 
this rose garden has to be, the way I like it to be, and I’m not quite sure if this 
is right or this is wrong. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, that’s really a tricky one. Remember, we talked about if we’re over-
controlled, we let go. It’s hard for me to say because if it’s interfering with it, 
then of course you want to step back a little bit and let things be, but then 
maybe the fact that you’re changing it to suit your taste actually is working for 
you and may continue to do that. 
 
 
What I recommend is the only way you can really find out is at some point – 
not whilst we’re here but maybe when you go home tonight – do the exercise 
like this again and do it both ways.  
 
 
Decide to go to a scene and leave it exactly as it is when you arrive, and other 
times go to a scene and organize it to suit yourself, and then go to another 
scene and leave it exactly as it is, and then another scene and organize it as 
you wish. 
 
 
Between them with practice or doing enough of them, you should get a sense 
of which one suits what kind of purpose better for you. Does that make 
sense? 
 
Student: Yes, I’m already doing that because I wanted to be in control not to let 
everything get underway after this lesson I’m learning. I realize I’m doing that, 
but I didn’t know do I have to really control it, not control it or what is the 
best way?  
 
Igor: 
Ultimately there is no answer to that question. It’s almost like saying how long 
is a piece of string? What matters is; is it working for the kind of work you’re 
trying to do? 
 
Student: Oh yes, I enjoy every little detail. 
 
Igor: 
Apart from that there will be some types of work that you’ll need to do where 
you need to let go more so that your unconscious does more of the heavy 
lifting.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
419 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
There will be other kinds of work where you don’t need it as much and you 
can put more structure in so that you can contain your unconscious mind 
more towards the kinds of things you want to do. 
 
 
It’s going to be a balancing act. Sometimes you’ll need more control and 
sometimes you’ll need less control, so being able to go between the two is 
going to be very valuable to you. 
 
 
What I can’t tell you is which one is always going to be better because I don’t 
think that’s the case. My tendency is I try not to change things at all in the 
environment. I’ll just take the environment as it is.  
 
 
If I don’t like that particular environment, I’ll sit with it, I’ll let it be as it is, I’ll 
benign towards it and then I’ll clarify with my unconscious that I’d like to go to 
another place like this, only I’d prefer it if you included these things too or 
made these adjustments because they make me happy. Then I’ll just see what 
happens there. 
 
 
Again, I’m not going to try to do it. I want my unconscious do to all the work 
for me. 
 
Student: I’m not doing it consciously. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. 
 
Student: Subconsciously it just creates it for me. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, it adjusts itself as you go along? 
 
Student: It just comes. I see the rose garden and suddenly the roses became beautiful 
big red… 
 
Igor: 
That’s all I need to hear. You’re in a good place.  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
The way you can tell is you can hear by how she’s describing it – the benign 
attention. That’s all we need to hear. Well done.

Arthur: 
There are two points I’d like ask. One is I find in this and also in some of the 
other exercises that it’s almost like a dream, in that as soon as I finish it, I 
don’t remember what it was or I only remember one of the things and not the 
others. 
 
 
The second thing is in this particular exercise I went to four memories that 
were pleasant, so that was all right. It didn’t have to be a… 
 
Igor: 
Did you unconscious mind do what you asked of it – take me to four scenes 
that are pleasant? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Then it’s doing exactly what you asked for. 
 
Arthur: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
The purpose of this is not necessarily that it has to be a memory or landscapes 
or anything like that. It’s the pleasantness that’s important. It will become 
more apparent as we go along. 
 
 
As to the memory part and the dream part, I think we spoke to that earlier on 
with someone else who came up and forgot the middle teleportation that 
they did. It is very dreamlike and some of us will forget some things and not 
others. That’s just fine. 
 
 
If you want more memory of it, start running a mentalization journal where 
you write down the essence of what happened each time, and that will show 
your unconscious how serious it is for you to remember, and eventually you’ll 
start remembering more of those things.  
 
 
By the way, the same is true of dreams. If you want to remember more of 
your dreams by keeping a dream log or a dream journal, you start 
remembering more of your dreams. It’s just one of those chicken and egg 
type things. 
 
Student: I had a really funny experience. 
 
Igor: 
Good.

Student: I just went to where my mind led us explore someplace, and surprisingly I was 
taken to four restaurants even though I’m not hungry, and at least two of the 
restaurants I have to check out because it took me to places which I know and 
I was not aware that they were restaurants over there.  
 
 
So, I want to check those out but it was surprising. The moment I sat down 
and had food I want they said come, let’s go somewhere else, so I went to 
another place. Progressively they started with a Greek food restaurant and I 
landed up at a five-star restaurant.  
 
Igor: 
It sounds like a food court. 
 
Student: Then I came back. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Good job. Well done. Now we know a resource for you, right? 
 
Student: When I was getting scenes, I was reminded of an exercise we did in Chicago of 
that’s great because. A lot of the scenes were fairly benign but it’s like that’s 
great because. That’s how I was able to keep the positive bent on the scenes. 
 
Igor: 
The enthusiasm, especially behind the question, is the more important part, 
right? Well done. 
 
Student: I don’t know if I’m the only one here… 
 
Igor: 
Well, there are several other people in this room. 
 
Student: No, let me rephrase that again. I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again was an old 
series actually. I went through what I thought was the way we were supposed 
to go through it, and I spoke to my subconscious but I don’t think it wants to 
talk to me because the only thing that happened after a long, long time was – 
everything is like night. There are no lights. There’s nothing. 
 
 
Then I had the sensation that I was flying but I didn’t know where I was flying 
– I mean I didn’t see anything – but that was the only sensation I got and then 
you came in and said now start grounding yourself.  
 
 
I thought I only just took off. Maybe it’s going to take me a little bit longer. I 
do appreciate that it’s going to take me longer.

Igor: 
It can do. As long as you can take it in stride with a big smile on your face and 
say I’ll get there… 
 
Student: That’s the only way. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the whole point, right? We’ve been working hard and we’ve been 
working at quite a pace. Some people pace suits, some people it’s a little slow 
and some people it will be way too fast. That’s not the important part because 
we have limited time here, so I’ve got to the best I can with you guys here. 
 
Student: I agree. 
 
Igor: 
You know the exercises. You know how to get there and on the fifth day I’ll 
walk you through the kinds of progressions that will allow you to recreate the 
experiences when you go back home again. 
 
Student: Good. I just wanted to stand up in case there are several of us here that 
maybe think the same way and think no I’m not going to say anything. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate you doing that and I want to keep reemphasizing this. This is 
going to be very important, especially as we do the more practical stuff in the 
next few days. 
 
 
Some of them may not work out for you in here because you’re missing some 
background skills first. So, just take it in stride and just think great, once I’ve 
had these other skills, this stuff will really work. There will be enough proof of 
that in the room to help give you some hope about the future.  
 
Student: I had a bit of a bizarre afternoon. Somewhere in the middle of two when I had 
to go to a strange new world and things were going on. I couldn’t figure out 
what they were, so I thought you don’t know what you’re trying to do. I go to 
another one, same thing. 
 
 
Then I couldn’t make it out, so I thought well give me something I can 
understand. Everything is absolutely blank from there right through to the 
spontaneous transformation – nothing. I can’t remember anything.  
 
Igor: 
Do you remember nothing or you don’t think you experienced anything? 
Those are two different things.

Student: I don’t know. I have no idea. It’s just blank. It’s gone. But what happened 
when I did the mammal, I did the owl, I thought well I kind of apologized and 
said if I ticked you off and didn’t like what you sent me and so there was this 
owl and I was thinking about of what described it. 
 
 
Then all the sudden it was like there was a panoramic photograph all around 
the room about six inches high and that’s what I could see, and I was flying so 
I could look around and see this, but that was the vision I got and that’s all. No 
more, no less. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. 
 
Student: Then the last one I think I appeased my unconscious mind because it took me 
to a place and it was, there were Indians, now they’re First Nation in Canada. 
We were doing a night, dark, doing a dance, beautiful, no sound and it was 
very enjoyable and then right away I went to this light in the corner, and it 
was like a glass, it was just still and just gorgeous. So, I went somewhere that 
time. I could remember it. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. First of all, congratulations. Give him a round of applause for that. 
Again, whatever you like hearing about that whole process is you’ve seen the 
reason why we have those seven rules in action, especially that equanimity 
rule. Do you see how important that is, and then building that relationship? 
 
 
It makes perfect sense. You invalidate the relationship. Fine, I’m not playing. 
Then you apologized to it, okay we’ll test you out with this little owl thing. 
Okay, Topanga grace so you can have a little bit more. 
 
 
In some respects it’s a similar experience that you were having over here, 
which is it takes time to develop that relationship and the skill and to 
navigate. You’re doing some very complicated things, some things that our 
culture does not do – in fact something that our culture punishes in some 
respects. 
 
 
Little Johnny wakes up and says mommy, I’ve had a nightmare. Oh, it’s only a 
dream. Only a dream – diminishing it. It’s pejorative, right? Little Johnny 
comes in the kitchen and says mommy, Dave told me that we should go to the 
park now. She says how many times did I tell you Johnny, Dave isn’t real. Do 
you see where we’re going with this?

Our culture does not know how to incorporate unconscious material into it, so 
we’ve been punished growing up and we’ve put in a lot of checks against it. 
What we’re doing now is we’re slowly dismantling that machinery whilst of 
course building up other machinery for the sake of safety, and it’s going to 
take time. For some of us it will take more time than for others but that’s 
okay. Why rush? Go ahead. 
 
Student: Tying in with what Arthur said about it being like a dream, and sort of literally 
maybe to an extent too. My last place that I went to was a bright white light 
thing. I had to actually work my way back, but I write down my dreams and I 
obsessively have been writing down all my mentalizations.  
 
 
So, I was able to work my way back through everything I did, but it was really 
very, very dreamlike. Just because you may only remember one, you may 
have been to any number of places.  
 
 
It’s just that unless you’re used to working your way backwards through your 
mind, you may have just remembered the last thing that you did. That doesn’t 
mean that you didn’t do a lot of things. It just means that a lot of things didn’t 
necessarily come back with you, but that’s just my fish. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. It’s a skill we’re learning and each one of us has a different aspect of 
that skill to learn, and we didn’t give you the overall package. For some of you 
some parts are obvious and other parts are less obvious. The more we do 
these exercises the more we’ll discover what that skill is. 
 
Student: I actually went back to the seminar in the Bahamas and it was actually the day 
before and I was going magic for the bartenders, and some of the tricks that I 
did I forgot that I actually did for them, but I had a bit of confusion with the 
senses. 
 
 
We’ve all seen old JFK movies and all that stuff. It was grainy on the edges, so 
I thought I just had to ground myself a little bit more. I remember grabbing 
the bar. I could feel it, the temperature, the texture but it just looked grainy 
on the sides, so the conflict between the visual and the other senses – is that 
normal?  
 
Igor: 
What’s normal? I’ll tell you what’s normal is a bunch of psychologists getting 
into a room and voting no whether we should have a new mental disorder or 
not.

The only important thing is this how your mind is operating? If it’s working for 
you, it’s good. If it’s not working for you, then figure out where you have 
violated some of the rules of working with your own mind and stop it. 
 
 
In this case, I see nothing at all wrong with it. You had a full tactile experience. 
You had at least enough of a visual experience to be worthwhile. There are 
people in this room who have had no visual experiences at all. Hands up if 
you’ve had no visual experiences at all in terms of the things we’re doing. 
 
 
Still they have satisfying things. You have someone dying constantly but you 
can’t see yourself dying.  
 
Student: I guess it could be worse. 
 
Igor: 
She’ll be very happy about it too. So, the visual part of it is not the important 
element. That’s why we call it mentalizations. What’s important is the overall 
experience. Is it producing what you want it to, what you need it to? Over 
time I can almost guarantee that your whole senses – all five senses – will 
start activating more and more and more fully the more you use them. Make 
sense? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Thank you for bringing that up. It’s useful. 
 
Student: For me yesterday I had been trying to give the experience joy and I’m not 
experiencing that but experiencing things that were not far off. I set the 
intention of having the positive experiences and I did jump from scene to 
scene, and as I jumped from scene to scene the experiences got happier, 
more joyful. 
 
 
Then I stopped being me. I was a fish at one point in the ocean and there was 
lots of turmoil at the top but hey it was great where I was. Then right at the 
end, I actually became a sound wave. 
 
Igor: 
Wow. 
 
Student: And I was zipping around and I was feeling this incredible joy, and I heard this 
voice say it’s time to give something back, and I thought I’m a sound wave, so 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
426 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
I can go tinkle bells, I can a little child’s rattle. So, I was just zipping around all 
over the place making lovely little sounds for people. It was just the most 
wonderful experience. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for sharing that. That’s awesome.  
 
Student: Hi. I’m just curious. I find myself every time somebody says my unconscious is 
playing tricks on me thinking how do you know it’s not giving you exactly what 
you’ve looked for but you don’t yet understand it?  
 
 
When I hear you, I think gosh almighty maybe that’s just been consciousness 
itself without form. How do you know? I find myself and I do it as well. When 
I’m listening I’m thinking there’s an assumption that your unconscious is not 
giving you what you want, but actually your unconscious gives you what you 
want every time, but maybe we don’t understand it consciously yet. 
 
Igor: 
If I may make a slight adjustment to what you said, I agree 100% with the 
sentiment. Instead of saying your unconscious mind always gives you what 
you want, maybe it just gives you what you need, to quote some famous 
particular people. Thank you for that. Thank you.  
 
Student: The last few exercises have been a bit frustrating because it was like my 
conscious mind couldn’t figure out how to integrate itself into the different 
visualizations that I was creating. 
 
 
But then this last time, it was like I was just playing and at one point I 
challenged my unconscious to see who could get through the sun the 
quickest. I was flying and I was winning, and then I noticed my unconscious 
disappeared at one point, and then just as I was right at the edge of sun, it 
reappeared again just in front of me. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, your unconscious can cheat like that, right? 
 
Student: It was a reminder that my conscious can play a part and it can do what it 
wants, but ultimately I’m in the realm of the unconscious and that’s the one 
that’s going to have the best stuff. 
 
Igor: 
You’ve just nailed the entire purpose of this process, of the ASH Method in 
general. I totally agree with you. In fact you see all kinds of things there. You 
see the value of the equanimity practice. Whilst there’s frustration with so

much going on. Then I decide to just go and play with it. Play is your 
benevolent or benign attention. Then of course we have the unconscious 
mind letting you win for a bit and then reminding you at the end that really 
it’s running the show there, which is perfect.  
 
 
What you’re describing again – and this is the main theme of our first three 
days here – is how do you become co-conscious and how do you get to that 
narrow path of co-consciousness where you’re not overbearing or under 
bearing so that it becomes useful to you, but your unconscious mind still plays 
along with you as well? So, thumbs up for you. Well done. Congratulations. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
I realize it’s late in the day and people are getting tired, so we’re going to do a 
couple of quick things and then we’re going to do the final couple of 
exercises. They’re all variations of the same theme. 
 
 
For the sake of energy, why don’t you all just do some mindful movement to 
kind of get your energy back up again and then we’ll actually do the final 
exercise.  
 
 
You can do any version that you wish, but just take a minute or so doing some 
mindful movement to get your focus and your energy back up to a useful 
level, so we don’t fall asleep. 
 
Mentalization Warm-ups 
 
Igor: 
All right, so where are we now? You’ve learned a lot of skills and we kind of 
put them together into this exercise. The important thing is you can now with 
relative competency – I know you may not be as proficient as you’d like, but 
with relative amounts of competency – you can teleport between scenes 
based on the mood of the scene. 
 
 
Now I want you to put that together into an actual practice that in my opinion 
is possible one of the most valuable practices in the whole ASH Method, even 
though in terms of what we’ll be doing tomorrow and the day after, there will 
be some very cool practical things there too.

This is really the heart of the engine that drives it all, and in particular in terms 
of the safety valves that we’ve been trying to build. So, if you can teleport 
from a pleasant scene to a pleasant scene to a pleasant scene and have joy 
become real joy and then joy-joy or whatever variations you have, then you 
really have the capacity to intend a quality of experience. 
 
 
Now we’re going to use that to practice our equanimity, to develop the 
muscle that will keep you safe no matter what happens inside your mind. This 
one’s really worth building, by the way. 
 
 
The practice is actually really simple. It’s exactly what you just did a moment 
ago. We’re just going to change one little thing. I call this good place, bad 
place. In other words, you’re going to start off with your mindful practice to 
set the energy up. 
 
 
Then you’ll ask your unconscious take me somewhere really pleasant and 
then enjoy it for a while. You’ve just done that, right? Once you’ve enjoyed it 
for a while, ask your unconscious to take you to a slightly bad place. Let me 
emphasis that word again – slightly.  
 
 
In time, yes you can make it awful but right now let’s keep it slightly so that 
you can get a nice easy win. When you get there, it should be mildly 
unpleasant and your task, just as your task in the pleasant place was to sit 
there and appreciate it and kind of wallow in the pleasantness, when you get 
to the unpleasant place – the bad place or the slightly bad place – your job is 
to just sit there with equanimity, with benign attention. 
 
 
With the exact same quality of attention that you had whilst you were in the 
good place, you will transfer that into the bad place and just let it be. Do not 
attempt to resolve it or attempt to change it. If it does, that’s great. If it 
doesn’t, that’s fine too. Just let it be. 
 
 
You’ll hang out there for a while. Once you’ve done that for a bit, ask you 
unconscious to teleport to a good place again, and once again you get to 
enjoy it and once again you’ll sit with the goodness, the joy, the peace or 
whatever it is you get from that place.  
 
 
Then you’ll go through your grounding practice and you’ll finish up. Do you 
understand the nature of the exercise? This time it’s specifically three places – 
a good place, a slightly bad place, a good place – and then finish up and we’ll

come on back and we’ll discuss that. Does that sound good to you – or slightly 
bad? All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m looking at the light shining down on a lake, a lake in the mountains. It’s 
Lake Como. It’s beautiful, still, clear blue water and this time it’s fun. George 
Clooney is there and my friend Kenny and we’re going to go swimming, and 
there’s a lot of wine and laughter, a gentle breeze and I’m wondering if I can 
find somewhere that’s pleasant where I can be with my family, and we’re 
flying to Thailand. 
 
 
It’s a beautiful beach, clear and blue water, an island. There’s a little villa with 
wood and drapes. It’s open for the breeze out over the water. My children are 
smiling and laughing and there’s wonderful food and kind people.  
 
 
I’m going to somewhere slightly unpleasant. We’re having an argument and 
there are hurt feelings, and there’s inner turmoil. We’re in a hotel room and 
we’ve lost money where there was a lie, and there’s pain and shame and guilt, 
fear. 
 
 
I want to go somewhere pleasant. I met these wonderful people from Dubai. 
There’s bright sunshine and this beautiful pool and there’s laughter. There are 
beautiful tall buildings. It’s such a new and exciting city.  
 
 
There are so many smart people, and it’s pleasant to take a journey and 
discover new ways to find charm and enjoy people that you meet. I see my 
friend Kenny, a world traveler. We are to go everywhere, like a guide, and I 
can have my family there and be happy sharing these lessons and discovery, 
and we’re all waiting to see them discover their own surprise, and that’s really 
pleasant to see it arise naturally. 
 
Student: I guess something unexpected happened. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. 
 
Student: My mentalization – because this was supposed to be the part where you go to 
something slightly unpleasant, it turned out I went to something very 
unpleasant but I’m just laughing at the whole thing now. I’ll explain my 
mentalization.

First for the happy part, I was walking through a forest and it was a nice 
forest, a nice scene, a chipmunk passing by. A dolphin actually flew by me but 
he’s my friend from a previous mentalization.  
 
 
So, the path led to a series of steps that went up and up and up, so it went 
higher and higher and higher. When I got to the top, I was at the top of a very 
big mountain slope with snow on the ground, so I decided to ski down it 
because it looked very nice. 
 
 
So, I started skiing down it and then I found oh it’s getting quite steep, and it 
was getting steeper and steeper and steeper. Eventually it turned into sort of 
a big dark place and I kept going faster and faster and faster. 
 
 
I can’t say I was scared. I just know that it was getting faster and faster and 
faster. Then I started mentalizing. There were all these people around me 
who were also caught up in this place going faster and faster and faster.  
 
 
So, then they started banging into each other and so it seemed to be getting 
pretty dangerous, but then what happened after that is I tried to maintain my 
benign sense of everything and then it just started getting comical because 
people started bouncing into each other and going ow, ow, ow. 
 
 
Then people started tumbling over each other and it was just a big sort of 
bunch of people falling over each other but in a comical sense. Then the 
mountainside opened up into a big – like we went off the mountainside, but 
we all turned into birds and now we’re in the very pleasant part, and we just 
floated down to a green pasture and we stayed there, and that’s it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fantastic. 
 
Student: Yes, now the afterglow is it’s just a funny sort of scene. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. I love the symbolism with that alone, which is phenomenal. The 
other thing that’s really importance about this is notice how although we 
weren’t looking to make a resolution, symbolically that’s already beginning to 
happen.

More importantly in terms of what’s going on in here – your prefrontal cortex 
– the fact that you were experiencing fear calmly or humorously or whatever 
your benign version was – is already growing your GABA fibers.  
 
 
Your amygdala which is the one that switches fear on and off is being turned 
off, so as you use your GABA fibers, just like when you use your muscles, it’s 
turning it off.  
 
 
There’s a small fear – no big deal – so it’s a small amount of muscle you’re 
building, but as you get used to the process you can put the load higher and 
higher – in other words face bigger and bigger things – and the same thing will 
happen. Thank you for that. I appreciate that.  
 
 
That’s a wonderful description and it’s picture perfect. That is a classic version 
of good place bad place in terms of the mentalization process. Thank you for 
that. 
 
Student: I also had a very good experience. Actually, it was unusual I guess because like 
day one or two, actually it’s something like this because I already saw that and 
it made sense to set the intention to have some small fear or something, to 
strengthen this GABA fiber and have this mindfulness in there. 
 
 
But then it didn’t really work out this way now because probably the 
relationship wasn’t strengthen to the degree that I could handle even this 
small degree of discomfort. It worked out actually very nice. 
 
Igor: 
Isn’t that interesting? He’s saying it’s worked out really nice and I got some 
discomfort. Yay, I succeeded to be in pain. But that shows the idea that 
benign attention is being attached to it, right? Isn’t that a much more pleasant 
way to live life? Please continue. 
 
Student: So, I went to the first good place and there was like some Native Americans 
dancing around and I went on to discomfort and it was like some wolf or dog 
barking at me because he was pretty angry. So, there was discomfort there. 
 
 
Then I remembered the seven rules – interact and respect and stuff – so I 
asked him what do you want, and he was like well I want to be free. Right, 
he’s probably going to eat me up or something.

So, I just paid attention to it and it was like just try it out. Let’s see what 
happens. So, I freed him and actually he turned into some small animal 
running onto the top of my head and laughing. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: Afterwards I went to my second good place, and this was actually interesting 
because I was on a mountain climbing and I was going on a very small edge, 
and I start to fall and it was like come on, you’re supposed to be positive. 
 
 
But then I let go and I fell down and I landed in this cloud-like city, but I got 
distracted because I was thinking about something, so I was back on top of 
the mountain falling again. I was like oh wow, I can let go this time. I’m going 
to land there. 
 
 
So, while I’d fallen, I fell through the clouds and it was like oh, I guess that’s 
the punishment for being distracted, but it still ended up good because I 
landed in an ocean and I was looking up and it was very beautiful and calming, 
so the whole scene was very good. I actually think it’s a very smart move 
having those pleasant scene, bad scene, pleasant scene as a set up. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, it’s an important one. Let me explain why this set up is important while 
there’s a good scene bad scene. The way the memory works is it works with 
contexts. If you think about something that makes you feel bad, you probably 
zoomed into just that moment when things really went wrong. 
 
 
If you think about things in your own life that went bad but you can laugh at 
them now, you probably have seen a wider context. In other words, you’re 
seeing the badness of the moment but you’re also seeing some funny thing 
afterwards. There were some pleasant things afterwards as well.  
 
 
Maybe you see yourself laughing after this and so on, so your context is 
bigger. Your context is from a happier scene to a happier scene with just a blip 
in the middle, which is why it’s easier to deal with the unpleasantness of it 
safely. It’s just one of the ways our memory works.  
 
 
You were recreating the same thing you do anyways to make yourself feel 
good or bad about events doing this. Simultaneously of course you’re also 
practicing turning off the fear response, which build your GABA fibers, and 
that’s going to be one of the most crucial skills and powers that you can

develop when doing this kind of work. So, thank you for that and a great 
journey again. Fantastic. Well done. What else did you guys notice?  
 
Student: I had time to do the exercise twice, and the first time I did a pleasant place 
and then a slightly unpleasant place and then a pleasant place again. I went 
okay.  
 
 
Then I realized that I was going to have a lot of time waiting, so I decided to 
do it again and I did the mindfulness practice and before I was even done, 
something washed up that started as a pleasant experience. It was a picnic 
table and it was kind of dull but I was like okay a picnic table, I’ll take it. 
 
 
That didn’t go anywhere, so I went okay unpleasant time. I found a cave and I 
went in the cave and it had a high dome ceiling that might be three meters 
wide and crouched up there bunched up was a giant spider.  
 
 
Normally when I have an unconscious visualization of bugs – normally dreams 
– I panic, and I kind of went well I feel good now and there’s no reason not to 
feel good, and if I don’t do anything it won’t do anything to me, so I just sat 
there and watched for a little while and it didn’t do anything. 
 
 
I’m like this is going well. Hi. It didn’t say anything and then I said can I be 
you? So, I became the spider looking down at me, and the first thing that 
went through my head was I want you to leave me alone. Why won’t you go 
away? Okay, can I come see you?  
 
 
So, as the spider, I went down and started rubbing up against the person like 
a cat. Then I became the person with this giant spider rubbing up against me 
like a cat and I’m going this is fine. Then I sort of drifted off and when I got 
back to another pleasant place because that actually wasn’t bad, somebody 
was cooking me food. 
 
Igor: 
Very nice. A wonderful journey. Thank you for sharing that. Again, notice how 
you’re deflating symbology that’s actually very painful to you by doing this 
sort of work. I won’t be too surprised if the quality of your dreams change as a 
result of this. 
 
 
In fact, I won’t be surprised if you keep doing this sort of stuff, your whole 
experience around dogs in general changes, which is quite liberating, right? 
Congratulations. Well done. That’s awesome.

Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: I had kind of a nice experience, then it was a bit unpleasant and then it was 
nice but I think it was related to an event that happened about two years ago. 
I was snorkeling off Panama and had been snorkeling too deep, and I didn’t 
have enough time to go up to get a breath and I sucked water in and got a bit 
panicky.  
 
 
Anyway, the place I went to was a beach. I think it was also close to where I 
was. I was sunbathing and it was nice, cocktails and whatever. Then I went for 
a swim and I’d swum too far and I got out of my depths, and then I realized oh 
this isn’t good, I’m too far out. 
 
 
I felt uncomfortable and then I thought okay just go with this, just lie on your 
back and float a little and relax. Then a couple of dolphins came along and 
they were making that stupid dolphin sound – whatever it is. So, I started 
interacting with them and then for some reason I just thought well it would 
be a good idea to take a ride with the dolphins. 
 
 
So, I grabbed one arm on each fin on the two dolphins and they took me way 
under the water but for some reason I needed need to breathe anymore. I 
was just going deeper and deeper and deeper into the deep ocean, into the 
deep blue. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: I was just traveling around and seeing these beautiful corals and everything. 
Then you said come back and I was just going back up again. I felt totally 
secure again in the water. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Do you notice again the journey going through – it seems like you 
did it twice. How do you feel having done that?  
 
Student: I feel like I’ve gotten over that panicky stupid irrational fear of the water. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just speak to that if I could because remember with your unconscious 
mind everything is a symbol and everything’s real at the same time. This is 
how we can create problems in our lives.

Something shocking happens, we kind of bury it, we don’t really think about it 
too much but that shock is still there. It hasn’t been released. Sometimes it 
releases through other things through symbology and you don’t even know 
it’s happened, but sometimes it just festers in the background and can create 
real problems. 
 
 
Maybe you’ll go to a beach someday and that association triggers and you feel 
uneasy and you don’t know why. Because you don’t know why, you start 
getting more worried about what’s that uneasiness for?  
 
 
Do you see how the opposite of the equanimity practice – in other words 
instead of having benign attention, you start putting malignant attention on 
something and it starts growing and festering in an unpleasant way and 
you’re just doing the opposite of that.  
 
 
You’re making sure that things don’t trap you. Congratulations. Well done. 
That was an awesome journey. Hands up if your journeys are all pretty 
symbolical – in other words there’s no memory, the stuff that happened 
didn’t actually happen in your personal history. 
 
 
Now put your hands up if at least some of the experiences you had were 
actually working through some kind of memory like the snorkeling and stuff 
like that? Excellent. 
 
 
The reason I’m mentioning this is because you can use the good place bad 
place in all kinds of ways. I usually like to go freestyle just to see what 
happens, but you can actually target specific events. For example, you can say 
take me to a good memory or a bad memory and then a good memory again, 
so you start clearing up your memory repertoire.  
 
 
If there’s something more specific, you can say take me to a memory of a 
positive relationship and then a negative relationship and then a positive 
relationship, so you can start clearing up issues you have around 
relationships. Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
 
This is not necessarily the therapeutic part of it – how to use the inner healer. 
That’s actually something more sophisticated that you can do with that but 
just based on this alone, do you see how different aspects of your life that you 
may have neglected or didn’t know how to deal with can be incorporated so 
that you’re doing several things at the same time?

Your mentalization practice is strengthening, your mindfulness practice is 
strengthening, your GABA fibers are growing and simultaneously you’re 
managing to heal some kind of personal wound or whatever you want to call 
it from your personal history, so it multitasks very nicely and it’s all one 
experience. This is the beauty of symbolism. One little thing, one little 
experience can mean so many different things at the same time. I appreciate 
that. Thanks for sharing that. 
 
Student: I’m in the positive experience in Acapulco in a hotel watching over the big 
ocean with a beautiful blue sky, which is obviously a nice feeling. Then I asked 
my unconscious mind can you bring me now to a slight negative experience? 
So, I’m at the eating table with my mother and her husband, which is normally 
very nice, so I don’t understand why this comes up. 
 
 
So, suddenly my mother starts giving a lot of criticism, which she does to her 
husband. Then I thought all right, now I understand why it’s slightly 
uncomfortable. 
 
 
The point is that the whole blue sky is at the same time in the picture at the 
eating table, so I’m getting confused that it’s not a slightly negative 
experience because the whole blue sky is there. It feels good, so my 
unconscious already changed it and I didn’t let it. 
 
Igor: 
You’re like no I’ve got to suffer a little bit more first, right? 
 
Student: Yes, actually I did. Then I went into the critic of her and I thought yeah that is 
really a negative. I started to get critical of myself and then I went back to the 
good feeling to observe it with a good feeling. Then it became more quiet. So, 
that’s what I wanted to share. 
 
Igor: 
Then afterwards you probably ended up in a positive feeling again. 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Wonderful. What I’m really liking is how you’re spontaneously 
adapting the core method, the basic idea to things that suit you and it should 
be that way. This is not a rigid process.

These are just experiences so that we can have something in common to talk 
about, but ultimately it’s your mind. You have to work with it the way you 
work with it. That was awesome. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: There was a very funny and not funny, a pretty bad thing that I did towards 
the end of this whole thing. So, I had positive, negative and then the last one 
was supposed to be positive and I turned into a shark.  
 
 
I though oh my God it’s horrible, I’m a shark, but I’m like floating and they had 
blue sky and it’s all cool. I look at the fish and it’s all very enjoyable, and I’m 
saying to myself oh I’m not so sure about a shark. I’m like behaving. A human 
being is floating by and I just viewed it nonchalantly.  
 
Igor: 
Well, if you’re the shark … 
 
Student: Everybody had a conversation, wonderful things. 
 
Igor: 
Hey, it works, right? If in doubt you can always ask for another place right 
after that. This is the thing. You get to adapt it in the way that you want to. Do 
you understand the nature of what we’re doing here? The idea is you’re 
actually exercising your own neurology through the symbolic inner landscape 
here.  
 
 
There are some sects of Buddhism who for their equanimity practice they will 
basically contemplate a death in all kinds of gruesome possible ways. Some 
will even bury themselves in a graveyard to get into the mood a little bit 
better. 
 
 
With this kind of symbolism, you don’t need to bury yourself in a graveyard. 
You can quite easily access terror once you’re capable of handling it, and I 
strongly recommend that were you test that one out because I didn’t and I 
regretted it. 
 
 
Any emotion you’re capable of, you can have within the symbolic landscape 
once you start being used to the ideas of this. The important thing about 
today is learning how to have control within it.  
 
 
Not the kind of control you had on the first day, which is a more rigid version 
of control. This is more having a sense of choice in the sense of all right I’ve 
been in the bad place long enough. I’ll move on now.

So, you still have choice. It doesn’t follow you. It doesn’t choose for you; you 
get to choose how long, when, where and so on. Do you get the idea? Well 
done. Awesome.  
 
Student: Just a really short update on my dying and I had two good scenes, obviously I 
died, and something really surprising happened. In the bad scene, I didn’t. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. Give her a round of applause for that.  
 
Student: Another update here for you. My sensations have changed. I don’t visualize 
anything but when I asked my subconscious, I said look let’s do it. Let’s go 
somewhere. Take me someplace nice. Basically what happened was that I 
started to see – when you’re at night you certainly on the horizon lights 
coming up. Not pinpoint but general light.  
 
 
This is what I saw and there were a few funny signs that appeared and 
disappeared. When I said take me to a slightly bad place, it went dark and 
nothing.  
 
 
So, I said take me to a slightly darker place and basically what happened is I 
started to get various forms of dark shadows coming but nothing that I could 
discern. So, I take it that my subconscious is telling me I’m not ready yet to 
see something. 
 
Igor: 
It may be, yes. 
 
Student: And I said take me to a good place and then I had the same feeling again. I 
had the flying and a light in the distance, a general light. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: I said take me to a 50% bad place and that was it. There was nothing. There 
was just darkness and changing shades of darkness happening around me as 
though I’m in the dark, and as you are in the dark you certainly see shadows 
flying around.  
 
 
Then I though well it’s about time to get back to a good place, and once again 
it repeated the distant light. I then grounded myself and at that point a funny 
shape appeared, disappeared and then you spoke.

Igor: 
Fantastic. Awesome. 
 
Student: So, I’m making progress. 
 
Igor: 
You are making progress. Again, can you see symbolically that he’s getting 
exactly what he wants, what he needs, what he’s asking for and does it matter 
that he’s not having these vivid surround-sound multi 3-D things happening? 
No. He’s still exercising his neurology in exactly the right way. 
 
 
Remember, you always get to go back and start the whole process again from 
the beginning and build up step by step to get to that full sense around that 
experience. That’s what you’ll do on your own time, so congratulations and 
well done. 
 
Student: I think of what I tend to call my inner mind, I like that better. But I think my 
inner mind is now being very cautious with me. I asked to go to a nice positive 
place and it’s always up high and looking down and it was like a cartoon 
forest, and I think Bambi would be in there or something. 
 
 
I looked at that for a while and it brought a smile to my face. It was very 
pleasant, and I said now I just want to go to a slightly bad place, so it turned 
grey and then all the sudden a movement and it was a like they were 
transformers and they were coming in the old Roman – I forget, the Legions 
was it?  
 
 
Anyway then the whole army comes but they were all coming at me, but they 
were like transformers. They were plastic things and the very front row of 
them was going sideways, which I thought was kind of cool and I watched that 
for a while, and then I went back to a pleasant place and again it was like a 
cartoon – very safe – but in the distance this time there was a waterfall. 
 
 
It looked something like Victoria Falls and it was this great big falls in the 
distance, so I guess it’s being very protective of me now. 
 
Igor: 
Which is just what you want. There’s a reason we have these safety 
mechanisms in place, and we only want to remove them as our ability to cope 
increases. So, I salute your unconscious or your inner mind for being so kind 
to you.

Student: Yes, cautious. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. Okay guys, you worked hard today. We’ve gone through quite a journey 
so far. You’ve had the first day where we focused on just stabilizing the inner 
world, the inner landscapes, and doesn’t that seem like child’s play now? 
 
 
Then yesterday was all about getting spontaneous, letting your unconscious 
mind have some free rein to do stuff and it kind of went a little wild 
sometimes. It kind of went off track sometimes but you kind of started 
stabilizing that spontaneity as well. 
 
 
Today you’ve really started getting a little bit more practical, a little more 
depth into what you’re doing as well, but that’s just the nature of what we’re 
doing. Importantly, you’re learning to have control in a different sense. Not 
the stabilized control which is more rigid, but control in the sense of all right 
this is the quality or type of experience I want, off you go, wow me. 
 
 
All these sort of skills you have to continue practicing and refining and they’ll 
get much better as time goes by. This is the foundational part of the program 
and that’s the stuff that I’m going to encourage you to do a lot of practice 
with as you go back to your daily life. We’ll talk more about that on the last 
day. 
 
 
The next step will be how do we take these tools that we’ve learned and 
combine them into such a way that we can reach practical results in things 
that fit our daily life? 
 
 
Now that you have the skills – which on their own will do a lot of good for you 
– let’s see if we can start tweaking them towards something worthwhile. 
Would that be of interest to you? So, you’d better be back here tomorrow 
then. All right, see you in the morning.

DVD 13 – Skills Review & Putting The Beyond 
Self Hypnosis System Into Action 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Good morning everyone. How’s everyone doing? Did you have a fun evening 
last night? Who is finding themselves doing some kind of mindfulness or 
mentalization practice when they go home? Are you enjoying this? 
 
 
It’s important that you enjoy it, at least for me it is because if you enjoy it 
you’re more apt to keep doing it, and if you keep doing it you’ll get good at it, 
and when you get good at it then you’ll start getting big payoffs. 
 
 
The payoffs you’ve had so far are very, very small compared to where they 
can end up being. Hopefully they’re indicated of where you can go. Has 
anyone here already had some decent payoffs in terms of stuff that’s come up 
and things they’ve learned or insights they’ve had and so on? Good. 
 
 
I’d like to just throw the floor open for comments or questions on what we’ve 
done so far. We’re going to do a little bit of a general recap this morning, and 
then we’re going to start using all the stuff you’ve learned so far in a more 
practical sense. 
 
 
Before we do that, I need to make sure we’re all on a relatively level playing 
field. Stand up if you have a question and we’ll get over to you. Go ahead. 
 
Student: I was wondering in some of your other courses – for example Beyond Self-
Hypnosis and even the Conversational Hypnosis course – there are these 
sometimes independent tests that you can use to determine if you’re really 
talking with your subconscious mind. 
 
 
For example, in Beyond Self-Hypnosis you have the idea of the convincer. Also 
in the Self-Hypnosis course, when you were using the power pendulum you 
sort of asked it a question that it should reply yes, and you just say in your 
head no, no, no.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
442 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Even in Conversational Hypnosis there are ways you can check for an 
unconscious response. Is there anything equivalent here? 
 
Igor: 
That’s an excellent question and your acid test, the one that is about as noble 
as you can get is surprise. If you’re surprised, if you think it’s bizarre, if you 
think where did this come from, that’s an unconscious response because 
there’s no way you can plan that. 
 
 
Now you may not understand what it means yet – that’s another matter – but 
as soon as you’re surprised, it is a genuine unconscious response. If you’re like 
oh yeah I kind of expected that, then it may be or it may not be. You don’t 
know until you get that nuance. 
 
 
The advantage of this work over all the ones you’ve talked about so far is that 
in time as you get more used to working with your own mind you’ll have, for 
want of a better word, it’s kind of a felt sense about when you’re pushing too 
hard and it’s more you wanting and wishful thinking and when it’s genuinely 
unconscious. Initially you won’t necessarily have that and some of you will 
have developed that over life already but most people don’t because as I say 
our society discourages introspection, and so we don’t really know if we’re 
just wishful thinking or if we’re doing it for real. 
 
 
Until then, the initial test – which is the fail safe test – is surprise. If something 
surprising occurs the unconscious is there. Have you studied the 
Conversational Hypnotherapy program? Yes? Do you remember the Dynamic 
Mental Imagery induction?  
 
 
Remember how we set it up when we have that nice little landscape to orient 
in, and before they go towards the actual therapeutic symbol, what do you 
do? You say oh what’s that over there? Then you see if something just pops 
up unconsciously. 
 
 
That’s the surprise element and that’s your first check to make sure that the 
unconscious mind is working. That’s in a more sort of a defined context, so it’s 
easier for people to understand, but in here it works exactly the same way. If 
it’s surprising, it’s unconscious. That’s the general rule of thumb.  
 
 
The other one is emotions. If you have a strong emotional response, it’s 
unconscious. Did anyone here draw up an emotion at will, or do you have to 
think about an event or a scenario that will evoke the emotion for you?  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
443 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Emotions are part of the language of the unconscious, so if you have a strong 
emotional response you’ll know it’s an unconscious one again. The thing you 
won’t know again necessarily is what it means, at least not straightaway.  
 
 
 
So, the idea of drawing meaning from something is going to require some 
time to adapt the skill to it but you’re developing tools, and today we’ll talk 
more about additional tools to help you do that. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, that’s good. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you very much. 
 
Student: I have a question around symbolism. It sounded as though most people were 
experiencing some kind of symbols. For me in the very last exercise we did 
yesterday, it was more like a sledge hammer. It was very direct and actually it 
was a voice. It wasn’t my voice. It was a male voice but the message was 
extremely direct. Does that happen under different circumstances? Is it 
perhaps that there was more of a surface level there and maybe get symbols 
when it’s deeper? 
 
Igor: 
Actually, that’s an excellent question. It’s actually what we’ll be coming to 
today, so I’m going to give you a little bit of a head start and then we’ll 
actually experience it in terms of the work we’ll be doing today. 
 
 
The unconscious mind works with symbolism. It loves symbolism. It’s just a 
part of the language, it speaks it. I think it’s got to do with the Law of 
Association. You know that in a dream you can have a figure that represents 
multiple people and experiences in your life. There’s a felt sense about this 
portion is that part of my father, this portion is that part of my pet and this is 
my friend, and they’re all kind of combined into one symbol that you can 
interact with and that element will always be there. 
 
 
However, as you get more used to trusting your unconscious, the message 
you can get back from it can be very direct. The advantage of training 
someone one-on-one versus in a group is that I can help them just pause at 
the moment where they can have the real discovery to learn from it.  
 
 
As a group, I just have to try to set the exercises as best I can for you to have 
the experiences and then we can talk about them, so it’s not quite as ideal but 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
444 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
more of you get to have that rather than not right. But, eventually you’ll get 
to a very, very direct point where you end up having a normal conversation 
with your unconscious and the symbol will bounce right back, sometimes just 
the voice but very often you’ll actually have a landscape with a person, and 
you’ll sit down for a nice honest chat and you’ll be surprised.  
 
 
It will be emotional and all the hallmarks that this is an unconscious response 
rather than a made-up conversation and it can be very, very direct, and I 
prefer that and I set it up for that because sometimes I’m very stupid. I 
haven’t gotten it, I’m like what do you mean, just help me out with this? So, 
having a direct answer can help a lot but you won’t get the direct answer until 
you have the relationship. 
 
 
It’s kind of true to life anyway, isn’t it? With acquaintances, you’re not quite 
as direct with them you’re more polite and standoffish and sometimes we 
holler back because it’s not worth potentially getting into an argument or 
something like that. 
 
 
With close friends, members of our family and so on we are more willing to 
express our genuine sentiment politely in terms of the relationship, but we’re 
more willing to risk conflict for the sake of the honesty or the truth or the 
value that comes out of that. Does that help? 
 
Student: It does a great deal. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: My question is how important is it that the experience is really emotional and 
in the real life like a full blown hallucination for the efficiency of this work? 
 
Igor: 
You’ve asked two separate questions there, so let me separate them for a 
moment. The one question is how important is it to have a strong emotional 
response, and the other question is how important is it to have a vivid 
experience?  
 
 
They’re related but they’re not the same. Again this is a difficult one to 
answer. That said, the simple answer is it’s not important and it’s very 
important. It’s one of these strange paradoxes. I’ve tried my best to explain it 
but your experiences will d a better job when you get to that point.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Initially, it’s unimportant because we’re developing a relationship. We’re 
developing a set of skills. We’re getting a sense of how we navigate with this 
and so on, which means that whatever experience you have is the right one.  
 
 
As we talked about earlier, having emotional responses is important partly for 
the sense of this is working, I know this is kind of happening right now; and 
partly also because that’s where the catharsis comes in.  
 
 
A catharsis for those of you who are not familiar with the word – I know there 
are a lot of non-English speakers here – is basically that process where we 
have emotional release of the things that are all trapped inside us. We release 
those emotions. We purge them so that they no longer come back and haunt 
us. 
 
 
You don’t necessarily have to have emotional release for a catharsis. The 
tricky part here – and this is why I hesitated – is those amongst us – and I was 
definitely one of them and to some extent I still am – who have died from the 
neck down, we’ve repressed our emotions. Do not expect that emotional 
content to come out straightaway. 
 
 
Is it still working without the emotions? Absolutely. If I had permission to, I 
could play you some of the tapes of the people I put through the beta 
program, some of whom had precisely this problem – no emotional response.  
 
 
In fact when we did something that we’ll do with you guys later on today that 
specifically targeted the emotions, it was blank. No landscape and no emotion 
until the breakthrough moment came and when that happened, there was a 
lot of emotion. 
 
 
Did it invalidate all the work beforehand? No. You see, the work beforehand 
put him in a position where he could have the breakthrough for starters, and 
secondly there are a whole bunch of things that he managed to improve upon 
that had no need for that emotional response – for example building a skill. 
 
 
For this person, building the particular skill that he was interested in didn’t 
require access to that part of himself, so he had lots of success with that. Of 
course on the other side of things, the blockage of course was part of the 
problem, which is where we had to help him get through. So, that’s the 
emotional side of it.

446 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Now let’s turn to the vividness of it. The idea of vividness of experience is 
again related to the emotional part of it. Initially vividness is totally irrelevant 
because we’re doing two things.  
 
 
We’re repairing our relationship with our unconscious or our inner mind – 
ourselves essentially – and secondly we’re developing skills. We’re learning 
how to navigate our own mind.  
 
 
Let’s take the idea of you’re going to an art class and you want to learn how 
to draw all these wonderful cathedrals and so on. It would be very, very, very 
remise of your instructor to get you to draw a perfect copy of the Sistine 
Chapel on your first day. 
 
 
Some people may have the latent talent right there to be able to do that, but 
most people could not and then they’d be discouraged and think I can’t do 
this and they’d leave. 
 
 
If all you can do is make an X on the page, that’s a starting point and that X 
can be developed into something more and more and more elaborate over 
time. Hence, vividness is of no importance when you begin. 
 
 
In time it will automatically become more vivid. It will just consume and arrest 
your attention or suck you in. Let me give you an example of what I mean by 
this.  
 
 
In terms of our group here, how many of you started off with mentalizations 
whether images were present or not, and then at some point – not 
necessarily consistent but at some point – one of the exercises just grabbed 
you and just sucked you in, and you went oh my God I can’t believe this is 
happening? Then afterwards you were surprised with the intensity, the 
vividness, etc. of the experience. Please put your hands up. 
 
 
That’s the place we’re heading towards but you can’t start there. Most people 
can’t start there. So, are they important? Yes, but no, but yes. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. So, before we start getting into the more practical content today, I 
want to do some general cleaning up on the ideas to make sure that we’re all 
in the same place.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

The first thing is that a lot of people have asked about the official logo or coat 
of arms or whatever you want to call it. There’s a lot of symbolism in here that 
may be of interest to you. The first thing you’ll notice is the motto at the end, 
which is Magna Est Bis Mentis. Does anyone here speak or read Latin? No? 
There you go. That’s more like it.  
 
 
Essentially that means great is the power of the mind, and hopefully you’ll 
agree with me that this is an appropriate motto for the work that we’ve been 
doing here. 
 
 
The double-headed eagle has lots of different meanings. There are several 
levels to this but the one that is of immediate interest to us is – for me the 
idea of double-headed eagle represents the idea of co-consciousness. 
 
 
 
Notice how they’re both looking in different directions because both our 
conscious mind and our unconscious mind have different reasoning 
processes. We look towards different things. We have slightly different drives. 
They’re looking in different directions but really it’s the same bird, the same 
eagle. 
 
 
The spread wings is traditionally a symbol of protection and the ASH Practice 
– the shield itself which relates to the ASH thing, which we’ll talk about in a 
moment, is contained in the middle of that. The idea being that your co-
consciousness – both your conscious mind and your unconscious mind – are 
working together to make sure you’re protected within the practice that 
we’re doing here. 
 
 
The tree is of course an ASH tree, and for those of you who either weren’t 
here on the first session on the first day or have since forgotten – which I 
understand – ASH stands for three things: 
 
 
 
ASH 
1. Archetypal Forces 
2. Symbolic Landscapes 
3. The Hero’s Journey 
 
 
Most of you experienced some kind of strong unconscious force coming out, 
some symbolism that’s very potent, whether you necessarily understood it or 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
448 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
not. That’s the archetypal forces. The way it presented itself was in the form 
of a symbol within a symbolic landscape.  
 
 
The hero’s journey is all about going to the places you don’t normally want to 
go to and overcoming whatever fear or pain or whatever was there, and being 
left with a gift or a result that you can come back to the normal world with 
and be empowered by. 
 
 
In the traditional Joseph Campbell camp shall we say it’s called a boon. The 
hero goes to the underworld, he has to either die a death or face his death of 
some sort, as a result of which he gains a boon and he brings that boon back 
to his people as a gift to the world. 
 
 
So, this is your hero’s journey in the sense that you’re going to sometimes 
difficult places. You are facing the test of confronting the fear or the pain or 
the sadness or whatever is there, as a result of which you gain a boon, a gift, 
an empowerment, a skill, an ability, an insight or a way of being, which you 
then bring back into the normal outside world – in other words you’ve 
changed as a person – and that will be your gift to the world, being a better 
person shall we say. 
 
 
Do you understand the symbolism in terms of the ASH – archetypal forces, 
symbolic landscapes and the hero’s journey? We have a golden key there, 
which is a traditional symbol for keys unlock things, and it’s also a traditional 
symbol for finding the hidden meaning in text. Particularly theologists who 
are reading through scriptures and so on use this symbol a lot. 
 
 
Once again the ASH Practice is all about finding the hidden key that will allow 
you to understand your mental symbolism better, and you’ve all got a better 
sense of that. Would that be fair to say?  
 
 
The final symbol in the middle is the waxing moon. The moon is a symbol for 
the unconscious content, for the emotional. The reason it’s a waxing moon 
instead of a waning moon is because it’s beginning to get revealed. Our work 
here is to reveal the unconscious mind in action so that you can start working 
with it, and then use the golden key to understand it better and get the 
results that you want. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Do you understand the rough symbolism contained within this and why it fits 
the work that we’re doing here? That was just because a bunch of you were 
asking about what it all means, and it wasn’t just a nice picture. 
 
Skills Review 
 
Igor: 
I’d like to spend a little time doing a quick review of the skills we’ve been 
doing so far. Let’s do a quick tour through our three days together so far. 
Does it feel like it’s been three days? It always amazes me how much you can 
pack into something like this.  
 
 
On our first day we just found some very basic mindfulness practices to collect 
our attention. Then we used that to help stabilize our internal environment, 
to just take a tour around rooms, houses, neighborhoods and so on. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do just as a quick recap is just go through that whole 
process. Ground yourself wherever you want – in other words do some 
mindful practice to collect your attention. 
 
 
Then take yourself on a tour of a room you know well in your house. It will be 
a very easy thing, so you don’t have to spend too much time on that. It will be 
a lot easier than your first day of course. Then bring yourself back. 
 
 
I would encourage all of you to do this in the privacy of your own mind now 
because you should be good at that by now. All right, whenever you’re ready 
do some mindful practice, then do a little tour of a couple of rooms or your 
neighborhood – whichever you prefer – and then come on back.

Student: I’m going to the house in the neighborhood where I grew up. It has a big open 
foyer. No it doesn’t. It has a small entryway and then a large living room. It 
had a formal dining room that we never used. It had mirrors on the back wall 
and to the left were the bedrooms.  
 
 
My bedroom was the first one next to the bathroom and I could look out the 
window. There were two small windows facing the front of the house and a 
large one facing the side, and I would sneak out that window sometimes to 
explore the neighborhood.

At night I could hear the sound of a train coming through the window. If I go 
out that window – the larger one – sliding it, I could crawl out. I could go and 
climb a tree in the front yard and watch all the people go by, the cars, children 
on bicycles with a great big banana seat and it’s very quiet watching them, a 
gentle breeze. 
 
 
I could come down and hear the birds, dogs barking and I could walk to the 
left but I’m being pulled to the right, so I’m going to go that way. I pass by a 
house with an engineer.  
 
 
It’s red brick and white and my friend lives two houses down, and there’s a 
guy that I didn’t get along so well with on left. I wasn’t sure, so I’m going to go 
there and he’s all right. Just into a business, I don’t really want to be 
associated with but a friendly guy, and then there’s a house on the corner and 
that man likes to fix up older cars. 
 
 
He had a ’57 Chevy. He had a red one and he had another one that wasn’t 
that model but similar that was light blue and I’m impressed with those, shiny 
chrome, different colors.  
 
 
This is also the way to school. I could walk to the end of that block and turn 
right and go to my elementary school. I always liked school. I didn’t always 
like school but I did in elementary school. It’s a place of fun and learning and 
occasionally there was some incident. 
 
 
I’m remembering now there was a time I couldn’t skip and all the classes were 
supposed to skip in the parking lot on little circles painted on the ground, and 
they call my parents to let them know that there was this great problem in my 
development. 
 
Igor: 
Wrap things up and bring yourselves back. That was pretty straightforward, 
right? This should be old hat, old news by now. The thing that amuses me is in 
about two or three minutes just now, you basically did everything we did on 
the first day. 
 
 
The essence of the first day has been encapsulated in those two or three 
minutes right there. Of course if you want to explore the nuances more and 
understand and refine your skill level a bit more, you go right back to all the 
exercises we did on the first day and you’ll be sent a copy of the notes.

With that, you’ll be able to just have more practices at developing that level 
of skill. Remember, what was the first day all about? It was about being able 
to mentalize, to stabilize your mentalizations so that you don’t have to work 
too hard at it, and it’s the beginning of your mindfulness practice, which 
develops both mental muscle in terms of the attention and the safety 
harness, which you now have come to appreciate hopefully how important it 
really is.  
 
 
The difference between the first day and the second day is that on the second 
day we were beginning to focus now on spontaneity. We want to hand over 
more to the unconscious. We’ll have a couple of exercises around that later 
on today as well, but for the moment the essence of the second day comes in 
two forms. 
 
1. That strange new world exercise where you’re going to a random 
landscape or maybe a couple of different landscapes. 
 
2. The opportunity to interact with symbols within that landscape. 
 
 
That is really the core skill. In other words, instead of you determining the 
landscape like choosing a room to walk through, choosing the home to walk 
through and so on, you’re letting your unconscious mind choose the 
landscape whether you set a theme or not. These are all nuances. 
 
 
Once again, what I’d like you to do is start with whatever mindfulness practice 
you wish to collect your attention. Then have your unconscious mind bring 
you to a scene that you haven’t chosen.  
 
 
You may choose the type of scene, whether it’s a scene of nature. I’d like you 
to see a forest of some sort. Just don’t choose a specific example of what that 
scene is. Do you understand what I’m saying here? 
 
 
Whilst you’re in that scene, choose some form of interaction. The key of day 
to, other than the spontaneity part, was the first five rules of Flight Club. 
Really the interaction is important, the respect, the equanimity, having some 
movement within this unconsciously generated territory, and we have lots of 
ways of doing that.

I think for the moment most of you should be familiar enough with it that you 
can just dive into the deep end of it. Would that be fair to say? So, let’s 
experience the essence of day two all over again.  
 
 Do a little mindfulness practice to gather your attention. 
 
 Then let your unconscious mind create a scene for you. Whether you 
let it do it freestyle or you choose a topic for it is entirely up to you. 
 
 Once you’re in there, explore the scene somewhat and see how many 
of the five rules you can use in your interactions so that you’re basically 
practicing the essence of the second day. 
 
 
Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m going back to my house and this time I’m turning right. At the end of the 
block is a field that hadn’t been developed and behind that is a forest, a forest 
that led all the way through a lake and I’m going across that field. 
 
 
It’s someone who owned a lot of the land and had a barn. It was open on both 
sides. I’m going into that barn. It’s very dark inside. I remember once in that 
barn there was an owl that suddenly appeared and flew over my head. I then 
turn around and when I step out of that barn, I’m going to be in a different 
place. 
 
 
I’m by a lake. It’s not the lake that I lived near. There are pine trees and wind 
on the water. The sun is setting in the background. There are sail boats 
moving across the lake. There’s an animal nearby, some kind of mountain cat 
or mountain lion that’s smaller, a lynx or bobcat. 
 
 
I’m going to talk to it and see what he has to offer. What do you have to offer 
me? I see its claws and its teeth. He had a strength, and there’s no reason to 
be afraid of my own symbols. It’s a force of nature like the force of the wind 
on the lake. I can feel this power, a force of nature or just be quiet and be 
with inside while doing the same method. I’m going to sit with that for a little 
bit. There’s someone there, someone that I want, a guide, company, some 
woman.

She has white, the kind of white and his hand linen, a shirt and skirt and it’s 
blowing in the gentle breeze, dark hair, someone I admire, someone I’m 
looking to her as a guide in this practice meditation. It can seem a lonely 
journey and it’s good to have an example to show the way. 
 
Igor: 
Now just calmly start winding up what you’re doing and bring yourselves 
back. 
 
Student: And I’ll let that scene fade. 
 
Igor: 
So, if we can characterize the kind of exercise that we did on the first day 
were about stability in terms of your internal mental environment, including 
that interface with the unconscious.  
 
 
Then day two was all about surprise or spontaneity. Surprise or spontaneity – 
these are all kinds of different ways for saying letting the unconscious mind 
do the lifting for you, which by the way makes your life a lot easier anyways. 
 
 
The exercise you just did once again in about three or four minutes, you 
encapsulated the essence of the second day. Would that be fair to say? So, 
then day three rocks up, which was all the way yesterday. The purpose of day 
three – I’ll write it like this, although I’ll probably have to translate that a little 
bit for you – is to have intention. What do I mean by intention?  
 
 
This word is unfortunately somewhat polluted currently because a lot of 
people use the word intend when they mean they can’t do – oh, I intended it 
or I meant well. Are you going to do this? Yes, I intend to do it. Do you see 
where I’m going with this?  
 
 
Intention the way that I’m trying to use it here actually defines a future 
outcome. Is there anyone here with children? Let’s suppose for a moment as 
a thought experiment that your house is burning down and your child is left in 
the house. 
 
 
You intend to save that child and you’re going to go in and do it, right? It’s not 
like yeah I’d like to save them and I’ll give it a go. I’ll flip a bit of water on it 
and it didn’t work out. That is a warped example but that’s just in my mind, 
but you get the idea here. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Many people in our culture when they talk about intention, basically they’re 
talking about a positive feeling towards it without any real fuel to generate 
action or make things happen. 
 
 
The kind of intention I’m talking about is the kind that come hell or high water 
you will make happen no matter what the cost is. That kind of burning 
intensity – this must happen and this will happen and I’ll move mountains to 
make it happen. 
 
 
It’s a function that again our society is not very good at and personally I blame 
a large portion of this on the school system because it leaves no room for 
intention for you. Who chooses in school – you or the teacher? Do this 
homework. Do this next. Do this exercise. 
 
 
If you don’t do it, then there’s a punishment. There’s an external driver. 
Where do children get to learn the independence – in other words I choose 
this and I will make this happen?  
 
 
It’s that sense of personal responsibility for things. It doesn’t really come very 
much. Then of course when we start hitting the real world, the world of work 
and so on, more of that is demanded of us, isn’t it?  
 
 
So, our intention suddenly has a shock and we have to start stepping up, and 
especially those of you who still remember making the transition from school 
life to work life, you’ll probably remember a sense of shock and overwhelm 
when suddenly you had to make choices and you had to live up to those 
choices depending on what kind of employment you went into. 
 
 
Some employers of course are just an extension of school where you’re told 
what to do and you keep doing it or you get fired. That does not build your 
intentionality very well. 
 
 
Intention I think is one of most fundamental human skills because it lets you 
design your life rather than just floating along and hoping for the best. Now, 
another way of putting the idea of intention here, in terms of what we did 
yesterday, is effortless control as opposed to just control in the way that most 
people think.  
 
 
Again, we lack the right words for this. I used the word effortless because 
you’re not doing it. Let’s use another warped example for this. Once again I’ll 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
455 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
use a loaded example just to be able to make a very clear picture of what I 
mean. 
 
 
You’re walking with your kids on a mountain path. One of them slips, falls off 
the edge and is holding on for dear life. Do you need a lot of motivation to go 
over there and help them back up? Do you have to psyche yourself up and say 
just give me a few minutes, I’ll get there, I’m going to do it? 
 
 
The kind of control most people think of is I’m going to hold on tight and then 
I’m going to focus on it and it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen, it’s 
going to happen. Oh, I missed the opportunity. 
 
 
Let’s take a classic example of going to the gym. How many people here have 
ever given up going to a gym? Before you gave up, how much effort went into 
I’m going to do it, yes, yes, oh a gym, I’ll be strong and healthy and fit and I’m 
going to do it. 
 
 
 
Then you go once and you say I will do it, and then slowly your control fades 
away. So, that style of control doesn’t work very well. That’s the forced 
control. When I have a go at the school system, I’m not having a go at the 
teachers who are as much trapped in that system as the kids are.  
 
 
You realize this, right? Because there are some very well meaning people and 
some of them actually do a very good job in terms of working within the 
limitations of that system. It’s the system itself is just sick and needs to be 
buried. That’s my opinion. You’re welcome to disagree. 
 
 
What kind of control do you get taught in school? It’s do as I say or there will 
be bad consequences, I will force you. Then you apply the same model to 
yourself – do what I want or I will force you. 
 
 
Of course as soon as the teacher turns his back, what do all the kids do? Do 
they do their homework at home? No, they do it five minutes before the 
teacher walks in because the teacher has no real control and they don’t 
realize it yet. 
 
 
So, the way we think we should control our lives doesn’t actually work 
because as soon as you look away, as soon as your conscious mind is looking 
the other way, your unconscious mind does something completely different 
based upon its desires.

So, we have a somewhat split personality because our intention is 
disconnected from our actual experience, our actual action, and for some 
people that is a very wide gap and for some people that’s a narrow gap. It 
depends on your life experiences. 
 
 
In many ways yesterday was all about healing that bridge and that gap again. 
For example, when we do a preview before a mindful movement for example, 
you’re intending the movement and then you’re actually doing it. You’re 
closing the gap again. When you’re calling for a type of scene – I would like to 
see a forest now or take me to a forest please – you’re not choosing the 
specific forest.  
 
 
You’re not having to build each tree leaf by leaf, which is the traditional way 
of building up visualizations – here is a tree, here’s another tree, here’s a 
pathway. It’s almost like you’re drawing a picture inside your mind.  
 
 
Instead you were creating an intention and your unconscious mind says oh a 
forest, poof, here you go. Do you get the idea? That again is a skill we need to 
develop, and in particular if we’re doing this sort of work how do we do it so 
that the unconscious mind again does the heavy lifting? 
 
 
So, it’s a continuation. It’s an integration of day one and day two in many 
ways. That’s the skill of the third day. Do you understand where we’re going 
with this? 
 
 
There are a couple of ways to epitomize that. One is of course mindful 
exercises with a preview, with intention. The other one that I’m going to ask 
you to do in a moment, although you can do both if you wish, is where you 
choose a theme for your teleportation. 
 
 
For example, I would like to go to a forest, show it to me; I’d like to go to a 
scene of nature, take me there; I would like to go to a calm place, take me 
there; I would like to go to a positive place, take me there; I would like to go 
to a slightly negative place, take me there. 
 
 
Do you see once again we’re connecting intention and experience without 
having to force the experience? We don’t bridge the gap with force. There 
should be no gap.

So, experience that for yourself once again. This should be very easy for most 
of you. What I’d like you to do is again whatever mindful practice you want to 
start with to collect your attention. I would like for you to choose a type of 
scenery.  
 
 
You can get as specific as a forest or you can be as general as a pleasant place. 
Then do a couple of teleportations just to have that sense of effortless control 
where you set the direction but your unconscious mind is the one that moves 
the boat for you. Does that make sense? 
 
 
If you wish to double up on your intention, then you can do a simple preview 
of some kind of mindful movement like the squat or the dynamic tension or 
something like that. So, you mentally rehearse doing the movement and then 
you actually do the movement. That already bridges the gap on the physical 
level. Then you do the same thing on the symbolic level by asking for a type of 
scenery and then experiencing it. 
 
 
That gives you a double chance to experience actually intention, effortless 
control in action. Do you understand what I mean by all this? Please whenever 
you’re ready, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m in a forest. There are trees around. It’s green, evergreen. No, that’s moss 
undergrowth. It’s just a forest like a ranch we used to own by the creek bed 
where the light filters through the trees. It’s a shadowed with verdant area 
with a lot of undergrowth.  
 
 
There’s mossy grass and the creek cuts a swath through the earth and has 
deep earthen banks and animals like to go there because there’s the water 
and the greenery and the shade, very tall trees that are a constant source of 
nourishing water. Sometimes animals are deer. Deer with antlers was always 
a symbol like Harry Potter with his Patronus, a symbol of strength somehow.  
 
 
When I was a boy where I used to read books about fairytale people, knights 
and weakness and he’d go on great hunts after a great stag in the forest. So, 
I’m going to call on that to visit me now. There are a lot of them. There are a 
lot of animals in groups and there’s one large one in the center. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
458 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
They don’t like me hunting them. So, I’m going to inhabit this spirit I called. 
Okay, now I am the animal and I want to experience the sense of purpose and 
movement with my group, the doe’s and young bucks. I have that. I’m going 
to move to a clearing of grass. It’s not far stepping out of trees to a sunny 
grassy area. Now there’s more light like the sun is setting. That’s the time 
when hunters would come on our ranch at sunset.  
 
 
I’m going to call for a slightly unpleasant scene and in this telling, from this 
perspective, as the light fades and more animals come out. There’s a crack of 
a rifle and one of my doe’s falls over bleeding. All the other animals and 
myself go back to the forest and a boy comes out with his father carrying a 
rifle. He’s being congratulated, and now I’m going to be that boy. 
 
 
That’s me with my father and he’s very proud and I’m excited, but it troubled 
me understanding we’re going to have to cut and process this animal so we’ll 
eat it later. Now I’m going to ask for another scene more pleasant and we are 
back at the ranch house. So many people, the extended family, and there’s 
laughter and they’re all drinking. The adults are drinking and the children are 
exchanging stories about what they saw.  
 
 
I’ll let that scene fade. 
 
Session Debrief 
 
Igor: 
I guess this will be the point to formally end things and come on back. I saw 
some of you having some powerful experiences there. Did you notice that? 
Let me ask you this. We’ve given you three simple mentalizations there, each 
one of which epitomizes a day of training with a particular theme behind it. 
 
 
Did you all generally speaking notice an increase in the intensity or the 
vividness or the way the experience grabbed you and sucked you in as you 
progressed through this? 
 
 
They also represent increasingly levels of unconsciousness. We’re going 
deeper into your symbolic landscape and because we’re relying more and 
more on your unconscious mind to do the work, the stuff that you’re going to 
get is going to be more and more unconscious. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
459 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, the more you try to do the work consciously the less conscious 
involvement there is, so you just practice and it’s fine, whatever. The more 
you rely on your unconscious mind to do the work the more you’re already 
there. Does that make sense? Are there any questions or comments on the 
recap we’ve had so far, or should I say the experiential recap we’ve had so 
far?  
 
Student: In the experience landscape comes and then a person comes and then 
walking down stairs. I’m on the beach and then the memory comes and then 
this and that and this and that but then I’m trying to follow it all and then I 
lose the point of the exercise. 
 
Igor: 
So, if I hear you correctly – and please correct me if I’m wrong – it appears 
that the problem at least in the last exercise was just the stability of it. In 
other words, you have so many different potential images that as soon as you 
have one, you jump to another and you jump to another, so rather than you 
choosing to teleport, to jump to another scene, the scene is choosing for you. 
 
 
That’s a question of stability. Remember we talked about co-consciousness is 
a balance point between controlling and letting go. When you let go too 
much, the unconscious mind runs the show and it will use its own 
associational track – the affect bridge or let’s call it the land bridge, which is 
the location-based memories; or it could be some other thematic theme that 
your unconscious mind uses as its chain of associations. 
 
 
But then you’re no longer in control. You’re no longer intending what’s 
happening. Do you see where I’m going with this? This is fine by the way 
because if you recall we’re moving through the whole ASH Method training 
sequence at a set pace, and that pace may not actually fit you. 
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll talk more about your training schedule when you go home 
and how you can get the most out of it and so on, but for the moment let’s 
just leave it at that point. 
 
 
Really all that tells me is you need to hang out on the stability phase or level 
one for a little bit longer to get the sense of how do I keep everything stable? 
Then you might need a little bit more of day two to keep it stable whilst 
surprising things are coming, and that’s really where you finding that balance 
point. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
460 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Day one is relatively easy because with stability you can get away with a lot 
more over-control and it still works for you. On day two you had to let go a bit 
more.  
 
 
Otherwise you can’t be surprised. But if you let go too much it starts drifting 
apart again into a more dreamy, jumping around sort of thing like you’re 
experiencing. 
 
 
On day three that pathway has become much more narrow and it requires 
more skill to navigate. All that tells me is you need to work through the first 
two levels with a little bit more time so that it’s easier to stay balanced on 
that path.  
 
 
I know yesterday for example you had lots of experiences which were very 
stable and others that maybe were not so much. So, you’re capable of it. It’s 
just it’s not consistent enough yet, so you have to build that muscle up so that 
you can keep it on track consistently. That’s all it is. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: What I found really fascinating about the exercise this time was that I seem to 
be getting presented with choices and they just sprang up, and I’d get this 
feeling of yes I want to do that or no I don’t. No, not that one, not that one. 
Oh, I fancy that one. Then I’d just kind of hop into that experience. It was 
really amazing. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, and now you’re understanding the co-conscious equation which works 
with intention. Your unconscious mind has an agenda too and says look these 
will serve my agenda, which of them will serve yours? 
 
 
That’s a wonderful way of sensing the respectful relationship you have with 
yourself. It’s not the only way of course. There will be other ways of 
interacting with your unconscious but that’s another nice sign that that’s sort 
of going on. Thank you for that. That’s wonderful. 
 
Student: I’ve noticed as I’ve done these mentalizations even if they start off with a 
different intention, there are certain themes that keep coming up. I think I 
have an interpretation of what the theme really means, like a symbolic 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
461 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
unconscious symbol, but what would be the next step then? If I think I know 
what it means, should I then tell the unconscious this is what I think it means. 
 
Igor: 
Ask me at the end of today because that’s kind of what we’re getting into. Do 
keep that question in mind and if I haven’t answered it in terms of your 
experiences, then please raise it again and we’ll have common shared 
experiences to refer back to. 
 
Student: Great. Thank you. 
 
Student: I have a question about the Flight Club rules. I’m just right in front of it and it 
seems like I have for the first time the choice to interact. I’m trying and I think 
I have a problem with the respect. I don’t quite respect those things that kill 
me. What should I do there? 
 
Igor: 
First of all, the reason they’re killing you is probably because. You can carry on 
just doing what you’re doing and eventually the lesson will get through, or 
you can think it through beforehand and decide – or intend shall we say – to 
actually resolve that part of the relationship.  
 
 
Really the simplest way of dealing with the idea of respect is equanimity. If 
you don’t respect something, you have made a judgment call, a value 
judgment about what it means that may have nothing to do with it.  
 
 
I’ll give you an example if I may. In Shamanic cultures for example, having a 
dream about death is very exciting. It’s a good thing. The reason for it is 
because it usually symbolizes a transformation, a transition, the death of an 
old life and the beginning of a new life.  
 
 
So, whenever you bring a Shaman a dream about dying or death or skull and 
skeletons and stuff like that, they start getting really interested and really 
curious, and then they congratulate you very much and if you have no idea 
where they’re coming from, you think you are a sick little puppy. But they’re 
not. 
 
 
You know how we talked about putting your fish in other people’s dreams? 
Please don’t take this too far because I don’t mean to go back to this double-
headed eagle. It’s still the same eagle. It’s not two people but just for the sake 
of argument let’s assume that it’s two people there.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
462 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
You’re putting your fish in your unconscious mind’s dream. You’re deciding 
what it means ahead of time and that’s why the respect is lacking. Does that 
make sense? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Whereas if you consider the possibility that you have no idea what it’s trying 
to do with this, then it’s a lot easier to keep your equanimity and just be 
curious – which is the benign attention – or interested – which is another 
version of benign attention – or compassionate – which is another version of 
benign attention – until the meaning becomes revealed more easily and then 
you’ll probably say oh my God how foolish of me to have thought all that 
beforehand. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I can’t tell you how to do it but I can tell you that the more skilled you get at 
the equanimity practice – the idea of just being mindfully aware of the 
moment with a benign attention without making a judgment call – that value 
judgment is really the sword that cuts your connection to the unconscious – 
then in time and I suspect in a relatively short period of time that relatively 
minor conflict will resolve itself. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome.  
 
Student: Do you have any insight about how to calibrate speed because it seems like I 
go along, I think yes let’s get an image. One pops up and I ignore it because 
I’m already almost past it, and then I realize wait a minute that’s a perfectly 
good image right there, but my subconscious gave up right off the bat. 
 
Igor: 
Again what you’re discussing there is really a question of stability. Has anyone 
had this experience where you want to go through a scene and it flickers and 
disappears again? Then it will flicker back and then disappear again.  
 
 
That’s a stability problem. You’re essentially having a similar issue about 
stability. The speed your unconscious mind goes is basically it arrives and at 
some point your conscious mind might start interfering with it and so it 
disappears again.

I’m doing a little bit of educated guessing of course. I mean when you think 
about the first tour of your house and so on, I suspect that problem doesn’t 
really arise in the same way, does it? 
 
Student: Not much. 
 
Igor: 
So, it’s less when you’re working with the first level than when you work at 
the third level. Correct? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. In that case you just hang out longer in the first level and when that 
stabilizes there, that skill will begin to transfer into the other levels also. 
 
Student: I mean I can usually come back to it and then stabilize it. It’s just like wow it’s 
so quick. I’m not used to that. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. In that case that’s maybe all it is. You just go back to it and re-stabilize 
it until eventually you learn to just stabilize it straightaway. Remember the old 
Sheba story we talked about in Aikido yesterday or the day before or 
whenever it was? It’s the equivalent of losing your balance and then finding it 
again, eventually it will be so fast that you can’t even tell the difference 
between the two. I have a similar issue by the way but actually in an opposite 
direction. 
 
 
When I start my more spontaneous practice – or the levels two and three – I 
usually start with a very blank screen. There’s nothing. Nothing comes up. 
Then just a hint of an image like an outline or something and then I’m mindful 
of it. In other words, I have benign attention on it.  
 
 
I don’t try to force the image. I don’t try to do anything with it. I’m just aware 
of whatever I’m getting in a positive benign benevolent sort of way. It starts 
emerging bit by bit.  
 
 
It’s almost like watching a movie fading out from back into slowly full 
Technicolor. Then if I leave enough time, it will suddenly suck me in and I’ll 
forget where I am. Does that make sense? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
It’s largely a stability issue and provided you take it in stride – which is 
another way of saying equanimity – it should resolve itself in time. 
 
Student: I just feel like such a dullard now. 
 
Student: Now if we assume that like you said in the Shaman tradition death or seeing 
death or experiencing death would mean transformation, then we could do 
that by design. What is your opinion of that? I could create just a succession 
of 1,000 deaths and that would mean each one of them would mean 
transformation. 
 
Igor: 
There are a couple different answers I have for you. The first one is the theory 
or the idea is actually quite sound. However, it goes back to the idea of 
control.  
 
 
In other words, if you’re over-controlling the situation, if you’re just 
fantasizing but death – which there are people who do – then you’re no 
longer plugging into as much unconscious content. You’re just having more of 
a fantasy. 
 
 
If on the other hand the symbolic death emerges from unconsciousness, 
that’s a different matter. So, you could for example call up a symbolic death 
and have a full experience of it, and if it’s surprising and emotional then you’ll 
know that they’re more unconscious. Then the thing that you’re trying to 
achieve would be very valid.  
 
 
If on the other hand you just think of novel ways to die, then you risk creating 
a symbol that’s empty, that has no life in it, that’s just been created just for 
you amusement value.  
 
 
It’s a little bit like Stephen King writing horror novels. It may not be 
particularly therapeutic for him. I don’t know how he does it, but if he’s just 
used to writing about death because that’s what he’s done, it won’t 
necessarily be therapeutic. 
 
 
Remember also this idea that the symbol of death seems like a 
transformation, it’s an idea. If you intend it and ascribe to it, then the symbol 
of death will be evocative of transformation.

On the other hand, if a death symbolizes something else, it won’t necessarily 
be that. So, there’s that level of it too. If you want to go down that route, I 
would strongly recommend that you evoke these experiences rather than 
planning them ahead of time. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
But it’s a valid experience to go through, and because of the emotions that 
likely will come up if you’re doing it evocatively rather than over-controlling, 
then I strongly suggest you build up the mindful muscle because once you’re 
in there, you have to work your way through to the other end and I have done 
this once or twice in a foolish sense of bravado and regretted my decision 
afterwards.  
 
Student: This raises another question. How do you make the difference between I’m 
kind of shoving it under the carpet or being mindful about it? Something can 
come up and I can say oh well I’m very mindful about it, I’m just keeping it 
down there, whereas I’m not really. I’m just rejecting it. 
 
Igor: 
I understand but that is a very difficult question to answer because it’s a very 
subtle thing. Part of the answer will be time and experience. If you can do it 
with small things, it’s easier to do it well and, importantly, you’ll see the 
resolution or you’ll feel the resolution afterwards, and so you’ll know this is 
what mindfulness feels like and you’ll create more of an instinct for it.  
 
 
The capacity to delude yourself is still. It will happen to me just as much as 
anyone else. Typically, what will happen when I do it is I’ll run two or three 
sessions and I’ll have a sense of realization, a feeling where suddenly it will 
just really come to life and I’m going oh I was faking it all along, I was deluding 
myself. 
 
 
That is a problem that requires subtlety to resolve and I think the answer to it 
is more experiences. This is one of the reasons why we have the first two 
levels there, which are relatively benign, relatively empty of personal content, 
but allow us to come to grips with how we navigate this world without 
interfering with it too much. 
 
 
Of course the mindfulness practice will help. The more mindfulness you do, 
the more you’ll have a sense of when you’re doing it and when you think 
you’re doing it.

Allow me to give you an analogy of what I mean. How many of you have 
noticed that when you’re counting your breaths, sometimes you’ve 
habituated the count, so your mind keeps counting but you’re just not aware 
of what number you’ve been counting? 
 
 
So, suddenly you get back to number eight and it’s probably correct, but you 
have no memory or you have no consciousness of having counted four, five, 
six and seven. That’s another way that balance point has been lost, but it’s 
easier to catch there than it is to catch in the scenario you presented. 
 
 
Hence, the more you experience the mindfulness practice, the more you 
experience these different levels here, the more you’ll be able to tell the 
difference between a delusion and the self-fulfilling prophecy we talked about 
before. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Arthur: 
In my laboratory one of the bigger collections of cells from people with all 
different kinds of diseases… 
 
Igor: 
Let me just give a context to people. Arthur is a medical doctor. He’s a 
specialist in skin and has done a lot of research and published a lot of papers 
on it. He’s not talking about his mental laboratory. We have to provide the 
distinguishing realities here, right? Please carry on. 
 
Arthur: 
Of course all of the cells the patients volunteered to have them grown, and 
we’ve grown them in the laboratory to try to understand about the diseases 
and work on wound healing and everything. 
 
 
So, in the second experiment, I decided I was going to set the intention to go 
to different kinds of laboratories. So, I went to a laboratory and I was showing 
all the people around and I came over to the cells, and all of the sudden they 
started talking to me saying let me out of here, let me out of here, I want to 
live and you’ve got me frozen down in liquid nitrogen. 
 
 
Of course I told them I had no idea that they had consciousness and actually 
wanted to live, and I’m in a dilemma now, right? What am I going to do? Of 
course they can’t come out because there’s no resources to let them grow, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
467 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
and the people that they from are not alive anymore, but now I’m faced with 
this idea that I’m captivating some sentient creatures. 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you for a moment? Thank you for the question. It’s actually a 
very useful one. There are a couple of different ways to look at this. The first 
way to look at this is you may have made a slight error in judgment in the 
sense of taking a symbolic reality to be an identical representation of a 
physical reality. 
 
 
Consider the possibility that it’s something else it’s referring to in a symbolic 
way and it’s using something you’re familiar with to do that. Now I don’t 
know what that would be. You’d have to have that interaction with those cells 
and the discussion and so on to figure out exactly what that part of your mind 
is trying to present to you. 
 
 
Can you hold onto that question again like the other one until the end of 
today because we’ll be doing some paradigms around working with personal 
issues this afternoon, which I think will speak a little bit towards that? It will 
give you some ways of managing that.  
 
 
 
For the moment, just really consider the possibility that that experience 
wasn’t about the actual cells you had in your laboratory, but it’s a symbolic 
reference to something else in your life and it’s trying to get your attention in 
that way. 
 
 
Now even if it relates to the cells in your actual laboratory, again the message 
may be something other than what you think. So, we have to tread carefully 
before we ascribe too much reality to what we’re talking about.  
 
 
When Pam was talking about how she had a very clear and direct voice, 
sometimes the message is very clear and very direct but sometimes it is not 
and this is kind of what today is about – learning to understand what the 
symbols are. That is yet another skill that we haven’t entirely covered yet. 
 
 
What was covered in the first three days is the ability to navigate the 
unconscious landscapes, to create them without interfering too much, to 
evoke them, plus spontaneous experiences come out and so on, but we 
haven’t learned to understand them yet in terms of taking practical meanings 
for our daily lives yet, and that’s really what today is going to be about.

So, pause your dilemma, pause the emotions behind the dilemma and at the 
end of today let’s see if we can revisit that with some experiences to put it in 
perspective. Okay, one last question and then we have to carry on. 
 
Student: I have got very good metaphor, which helps me to get very easy way that 
stays this state until you get all images, maybe it will help somebody else. It’s 
like to play piano you must have very strong fingers, but a very relaxed hand. 
Every child has that problem actually. They have been beaten with teaching 
and everything, it’s very hard to get that hand to relax, the fingers are very, 
very strong. 
 
 
It’s the same here. When you co-create, you shouldn’t concentrate on fingers, 
but you should feel relaxed mind and co-creation. That way it’s very easy in 
that state when images come in. 
 
Igor: 
I think that’s a wonderful metaphor, don’t you guys – the idea of having a 
relaxed wrist but with very strong fingers. That’s really what the intention is 
about. If you have a stiff wrist, that’s what over-control is about and you’ll just 
sound like Frankenstein clunking on a piano. 
 
 
If you can have what I like to call a loose tight sensation, where it’s very honed 
in on your intention but everything around it is just so relaxed it allows the 
unconscious mind to bring up. It’s a skill that’s going to require some practice 
to get good at. 
 
 
All right, so are you kind of happy in terms of the general gist of where we’ve 
been going through so far in terms of what we’ve been doing on the 
mentalization level?  
 
Mindfulness 
 
Igor: 
What we haven’t looked at yet is all the mindfulness stuff that we’ve been 
doing so far. 
 
 
The mindfulness stuff is kind of like if your mentalization is the mental 
machine that you are creating and operating then the mindfulness is both the 
fuel that drives the machine and the oil to make sure the machine runs 
smoothly.

So, let’s look at some of the purposes behind the mindfulness.  
 
1. First of all in terms of the fuel metaphor, it allows you to collect your 
attention. 
 
 
You’ve all had experiences over the last three days where by doing a mindful 
exercise your attention got solidified and so the mentalizations became easier 
and more vivid. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
Because of the prefrontal cortex, the way it’s kind of stimulated through 
mindfulness and in particular these GABA fibers we talked about, which send 
a signal to the amygdala to switch off fear – actually it inhibits the signal that 
amygdala sets off for fear – it also becomes our safety harness. 
 
 
There are many of you here already who have experienced that where you 
went in, it was at first frightening, you sat with it and suddenly the fear 
evaporated. That’s a very important part of the function.  
 
2. This idea of grounding allows you to come back to regular reality 
more clearly. 
 
 
Do you mind if we do a quick thought experiment on this? It will be mildly 
unpleasant for you but it will be vivid enough for you to understand why 
grounding is important?  
 
 
Here’s what we’re going to do. I’m going to ask you to do your preferred style 
of mentalization. I don’t care which level it’s at, just whichever one absorbs 
you the most. I’ll give you a few minutes to get into that experience. 
 
 
Once you’re there, I’ll give you another instruction, something to do in there 
and that will give you the experience that will help us understand this concept 
more fully. Is that okay with you? So, go ahead and find whatever 
mentalization will most vividly draw you in. 
 
 
All right, everyone opens your eyes right now and look forward. Who felt a bit 
of a jolt? Hands up. Was it mildly unpleasant? Who had a sense it was a little 
difficult to re-assimilate your mind to your body to be back in this reality? It 
was unpleasant. It was maybe even a little difficult to do that. Hands up.

Who’s still struggling to do the whole process right now? I apologize for the 
harshness of this. Please go ahead and close your eyes and bring yourself back 
in any way that feels correct to you, and then we’ll carry on and talk about 
this point. 
 
 
That’s it. Bring yourself back in any way that seems the most natural, and then 
open your eyes again. You don’t need to finish up anything in your internal 
landscape. It’s just about coming back in a slightly easier format. 
 
 
Let’s talk about that jolt that you experienced. A mind has a wonderful 
capacity to dislocate from our physical experience, our physical body and 
external reality.  
 
 
You’ve all experienced it to some extent when you’ve been asleep and 
suddenly you wake up for whatever reason – maybe the phone rings or 
whatever – and lots of amusement usually ensues when you have no clue 
what reality is trying to check in with you with. 
 
 
My favorite one is when I’m kind of dozing and the front door rings and I try 
to answer the door and get there going huh? Invariably it’s a door-to-door 
salesperson. They must see some really bizarre things. 
 
 
It can take time for our mental experience to reintegrate to our physical 
experience so that we can function back in the physical world, especially if 
we’re so absorbed in our mental experience that it becomes a jolt trying to 
reincorporate that into the physical experience. 
 
 
That’s what grounding is all about. I jolted you artificially here of course, but 
sometimes your mentalizations become so vivid or so intense or are so 
meaningful that, in terms of the distance metaphor, you’re so far into the 
realm of unconsciousness that it can be a little bit difficult coming back.  
 
 
Over the last three days did some of you at least have a sensation of maybe 
grogginess when you came back, or you felt spaced out or you couldn’t quite 
think straight once you were back here again?  
 
 
You were fine whilst you were flying around in your inner landscape, but 
when you came back here again it was like you couldn’t quite concentrate, 
you couldn’t quite focus or you felt a little bit clumsy.

These are all signs that you have dislocated your consciousness. I use 
dislocated as opposed to the classic or clinical term dissociated because there 
are a lot of negative spins in the psychological community on that. I don’t 
think it’s a bad thing. It’s just a phenomenon. 
 
 
The purpose of grounding is to help you make the transition from the inner 
landscape to this outer landscape more easily, more smoothly. Especially if 
you decide to engage in this work in a more intensives sort of way, you will 
definitely need grounding to get back to the outside reality. 
 
 
If you recall we talked about the guy at the yoga retreat that had that kind of 
inner space and then they gave him a steak to put him back to outer space 
again – not outer space but lower outer space. The purpose of grounding is to 
do that. 
 
 
Usually my default version of this – and I’m just sharing my default version 
and you will develop your own pathways for this – is to do a simple body scan 
before the integration breathing, and we’ll talk about that in a moment. Then 
I’ll come back and I feel very much aligned. I feel connected. I feel back here 
again.  
 
 
Occasionally if I had more of a dislocation, more of a disconnect, I’ll need to 
do something extra to ground myself further. By grounding, I mean getting my 
mind back fully into the physical part of my body so that I can function 
properly in the physical world.  
 
 
Usually with mindful movement, my preference is to do push-ups against the 
wall nice and slow and mindfully and so on. That usually clicks me back in 
again. Three or four rounds is fine.  
 
 
The same has been true with the people I’ve run the beta test group on. One 
guy in particular had such an intense experience that he had to go outside and 
stand in the grass just to feel nature a little bit.  
 
 
He came back in still very spaced out, still slightly disoriented, so I had him go 
against the wall and do mindful push-ups. I have no idea how many he did. He 
was gone for a little while and when he came back he had a sigh of relief and 
said I’m good, I’m back now.

Do you understand why we put this at the end of your mentalization practice? 
It just helps you make the transition from inner space to outer space more 
smooth. The more dislocated you feel, the more intense your grounding 
practice will have to be. That’s all it is. 
 
 
Consuming stuff will help. Physical touch will help. A massage or a self-
massage will help. Mindful movement will help, especially strenuous. The 
more strenuous it is, the more it forces you back into your body. 
 
 
Has anyone here ever had a period of their life where they had a lot of manual 
labor of some sort they had to engage in? You’ll notice that you really know 
you’re back in your body at the end of the day, right? Do you understand the 
grounding practice and why we have it at the end of the mentalization 
process? 
 
 
Again, my typical approach – every time I do a mentalization I don’t have to 
stand up and start doing exercise, although maybe that’s actually a useful 
thing for you guys too if you decide to. I just do the body scan and if I need 
more, then I’ll go to mindful movement or mindful exercise to get that. 
 
 
You will find your own routes for that. I offer you my path and then you can 
find your own way of doing it. Do you all understand the importance of 
grounding? 
 
3. Now we come to the integration breathing cycle. 
 
 
Something happens inside your brain whilst you’re not paying attention to it. 
Here’s a quick story. Some years ago my cousin and I were invited to a racing 
event. They’d hired out a racetrack had racing drivers coaching people. It’s 
actually kind of cool. They had these big helmets with radios and they talked 
you through how to do the race. 
 
 
It was organized by a Porsche club, so someone foolishly lent us a Porsche to 
drive and I was terrified. Has anyone here ever done any racing? You have to 
do really unnatural things like you have to wait to turn the corner until 
basically the point where you think you’re already going to crASH. You have to 
really delay the turn, which allows you to take a very tight corner that way. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
473 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
I was terrified because my normal way is I approach a corner, I would have to 
slow down nicely, a nice smooth turn and then speed up again afterwards. 
This is very nice. 
 
 
Now I’m approaching the corner and the instructor says speed up, and I’m 
going what? Speed up. Of course my unconscious mind is saying no, slow 
down. They’re pushing on my foot and saying no, speed up. Now I think I’m 
going to die. He pushes my wheel across and we get a perfect turn, and I’m 
thinking God that’s traumatic.  
 
 
So, I was a little stressed the first day. That night I went back to the hotel 
room and went to sleep. I was sort of moaning a bit to my cousin and saying 
I’m not sure I should come back tomorrow. I’m not sure this is for me. 
 
 
He said just give it another day and just see what happens tomorrow. He said 
you don’t have to drive if you don’t want to. We’ll just come back and see 
how you feel. So, we came back the next day and I voiced my uncertainties to 
the instructor. 
 
 
He said oh don’t worry about it. Just get in the car and we’ll do a nice easy lap 
just to warm you up a few times. So, we drive a nice easy lap and I felt good. 
Then he said just do another lap and just see if you can just delay your turn a 
little bit more. I said fine. 
 
 
Anyway after about two or three of these laps, I come back in and I feel kind 
of good. I thought this is much better than yesterday. Thanks for letting me 
take it easy. The instructor laughed and said you were going faster today. 
 
 
Something happens whilst we’re not paying attention whilst our conscious 
mind is not interfering with the unconscious learning process. Remember the 
ghost arm where you pulled and pulled and pulled? You had a lot of effort and 
then when you released it, what happened? 
 
 
Unconsciously it starts rising because you’ve cleared a predisposition for it. 
You’ve primed the result. So, the integration breathing allows your 
unconscious mind to simulate the experiences you’ve just had in your 
mentalization and assimilate the learnings, to integrate them, make them part 
of who you are without interference of your conscious mind, which doesn’t 
really understand as much as it thinks it does.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

It’s the equivalent of having that good night’s sleep so that the next day things 
have integrated more easily. It creates a barrier between the experience and 
your conscious mind thinking about it so that it doesn’t interfere too much 
with it.  
 
 
That’s really its main purpose in terms of the integration part of the 
breathing. It doesn’t have to be breathing, as we talked about with the 
gentleman over there who said the breathing practice wasn’t helping him. The 
traditional term for it in meditation is just to sit or sit with it. 
 
 
It really means you have an effortless general awareness where you’re not 
trying to do anything particular. You’re just aware of what’s happening. 
Basically it’s the equivalent of stepping back and letting your unconscious 
mind do stuff. You may be aware of it but you’re just letting it do it anyways. 
 
 
Sometimes you’ll space out a little bit. Sometimes you’ll be very aware of stuff 
happening. Sometimes you’ll just feel very centered. The point is you’re not 
attempting to do anything in particular, which leaves space for the 
unconscious mind to organize materials in a useful way. 
 
 
How many of you whilst you were doing the integration breathing just in the 
last few days had sudden insights or realizations right at the end, after you 
finished mentalization but before you came back out? That’s exactly why you 
do it. 
 
 
In other words, it leaves a space open for the unconscious mind to let the real 
lessons come back in and so on. Do you understand what we mean by 
integration breathing or sitting with it? Really it’s the ability to allow the 
lesson, the learnings, to seep into you rather than just being an 
intellectualization or something you haven’t fully grasped yet. Do you get the 
idea? 
 
4. Finally, mindfulness is the key to the equanimity practice. 
 
 
Remember, whenever you’re confronting some kind of a problem, you’re 
either making the problem worse or you’re making the problem better. There 
is no static.  
 
 
If your attitude, if your attention is somehow negative, somehow malignant, 
hurtful, damaging, judgmental, frustrated, fearful – these are all variations on 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
475 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
the same feeling. Then you’re worsening the relationship. You’re adding to 
the injury. 
 
 
You know the old saying adding insult to injury? Your fear, your pain, your 
judgment is the insult which gets added to that injury and so it grows. Your 
equanimity practice – your mindfulness – on the other hand, by refusing to 
judge, by having benign attention, by being aware of whatever judgment 
you’re trying to make of it – that’s where the healing takes place.  
 
 
That starts reducing the layers of stuff that you’ve built around the problem 
that keeps the problem the way it is. Incidentally Arthur, in terms of the 
question that you had, that’s the first thing I would encourage you to do.  
 
 
Rather than concluding this is what it must mean and, therefore, I’m going to 
feel bad about it, just sit with it for a while. You may be surprised with how 
much comes out that has nothing to do with what you thought it meant. 
 
 
Those are the five key purposes to mindfulness. Was this little experiential 
review useful to you? Does this make sense? Does this help you understand 
the last three days more clearly now?  
 
 
It’s important that you understand what you were trying to achieve for the 
last three days because even if you haven’t achieved all these things yet – and 
I appreciate it’s a lot to try to achieve in three days – you’ll have a roadmap to 
get there. 
 
 
Tomorrow we’ll talk more about how to navigate that roadmap, but this gives 
you a simple roadmap so that even if you fail at some point along the way, it’s 
simply because there’s a skill you need to strengthen, you need to build up, to 
get better at, to practice. 
 
 
Then you go right back to the same thing again that you failed at before and it 
will become easy and natural to you. Do you get the idea? Are there any 
comments or questions on what we’ve just done? In that case, go have a 
break.

DVD 14 – Creating An Inner Practice Room & 
Experiencing Deep Trance Identification 
Progression 
 
 
Warm-up: Interaction 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. Hopefully you had a nice refreshing break. We’re not going to 
get into some actual practical work. We’re going to start building up like 
we’ve done anything else. You’ll probably find that as we continue, each little 
segment that we’re doing has value on its own but put together it has more 
value than some of its parts, but we need to develop tools to helps us to do 
this.  
 
 
You have no idea what I’m talking about right now. I’m just setting the 
expectation up so that your experiences can fill in that expectation in due 
course. 
 
 
The first thing I’d like you to do just as a warm-up is just do a little 
mentalization moving through different landscapes. You can teleport if you 
wish. You can just walk around if you wish. They can be spontaneous if you 
wish. They can be just neighborhoods if you wish. I really don’t care. 
 
 
The only quality that I’d like for you to focus on or at least to intend in the 
way we’ve discussed already is that all the landscapes or as many of the 
landscapes that you navigate through have some kind of animate entities that 
you can interact with. 
 
 
Ideally it will be people, but it could be animals or it could be something else 
like Arthur’s cells for example. What I would like for you to do is to collect as 
much experience interacting with these animate projections of your 
unconscious – these animate symbols – as possible.  
 
 
That means you may just hang out with them. You may try to touch them. You 
may want to speak with them and see how they respond, and then slowly see 
if you can fill up a dialog with them. That’s going to a very useful thing for you 
to do. Whether you achieve anything or not is not important. What’s 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
477 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
important is that you begin to intend that sort of work so that there’s a skill 
you can start developing in due course. Does that make sense to everyone? 
 
 
Let’s recap. You get to choose what style of landscape you wish to travel 
through. I recommend whatever you have greatest ease with. Within them, 
however, intend or expect animate symbols to appear, preferably in the form 
of people but if it’s in the form of animals or something else that can move 
and talk, that’s fine. 
 
 
Then you’re going to engage in an interaction with them. As in any 
interaction, you’ll approach politely, may introduce yourselves, say hello, 
what are you doing, great. The level of interaction is unimportant. What 
you’re looking out for is, is there anything surprising that occurs within that 
interaction? 
 
 
We’ll give you a few minutes so that you can really get into this a little bit. 
Then we’ll come back and discuss that and the reason for it. Does everyone 
understand what to do in the exercise? Are there any questions? In that case, 
over to you. 
 
 
All right, pause it there and then find your own way back using your natural 
exit process. What kind of experiences did you have? This is the interactive 
part again. It does come from time to time. 
 
Student: Some of this stuff seems to be a bit more scattering starting off, but when I 
get there then it’s more vivid. People just say strange things and stuff, but it 
seems to be getting harder and harder to come from it all the time.  
 
 
Every time we’re ready to come back, I say okay now it’s time to come back 
and the Indian fellow was talking where he says don’t mind him, don’t mind 
him. Come on in. I just say okay, we’ll stay for a little while because all the rest 
of the people won’t be back yet anyway. It’s just getting harder and harder to 
get back and even though you say do the integration and stuff, I don’t even 
want to go that part of it. 
 
Igor: 
It’s kind of like last order syndrome, like just stay for another drink, just one 
for the road. 
 
Student: That sort of thing, yes.

Igor: 
First of all congratulations. It’s good to know you have such a compelling 
mind, isn’t it? You recognize it and you enjoy it. You will have a choice. 
Remember, we’re talking about co-consciousness not unconsciousness.  
 
 
We need the power of the unconscious mind but the ship needs a captain. It 
needs to be steered in a direction. That’s when you make choices. Part of the 
equanimity is remember we talked about if you have any kind of emotion or 
anything like that, you sit with it.  
 
 
Now it’s easy to understand why we sit with the negative emotions as a 
healing practice, right? What most people don’t understand is that you also 
sit with positive emotions because otherwise they suck you in and consume 
you, just as they’re doing right now. They interfere with your life.  
 
 
I’ll give you a little story that may hopefully illustrate what I mean here. Years 
ago I thought the best thing in the world to be is excited. So, I’d be chasing 
thrills wherever you could get a thrill – legally. I didn’t get arrested and did 
not harm any children in the process. 
 
 
Then I came across this concept that you can get overexcited and I thought 
what are you talking about? That’s just silly. Excitement is good. It feels good 
and you get a rush. 
 
 
Anyways, then of course my mind was trying to teach me a lesson, so I went 
through a period of about six months or close to a year where I was so 
constantly high that I just couldn’t get to sleep.  
 
 
At first that’s fine because you can party all night. This was back in my student 
days. You can party all night and this is great, right? The second night, yes you 
can go for it. By the third night, it’s like I’m yawning. By the end of the week I 
was exhausted and I said all right, come on just get to sleep already. My mind 
is going zing, zing, zing. 
 
 
So, excitement is a good thing but if you’re consumed with excitement, there 
are negative consequences also to that. Your equanimity practice is as much 
for the good as it is for the bad. You need to appreciate the good without 
being sucked into it.  
 
 
It’s just another way that the world sucks is into a story that is no longer 
useful to us. On an extreme level, for example it could lead to things like an 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
479 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
addiction where we’re chasing what’s the next step what’s the step, I’ve got 
to do it again and so on. 
 
 
By the way, I’m in exactly the same boat as you are, so I’ll get sucked into that 
as much as the next person, but at least when you understand the equanimity 
practice is as much about enjoying and still being benignly attentive of the 
enjoyment so that it doesn’t control you. You get to take advantage of it and 
move on afterwards. Does that make sense? Does that kind of match the 
experience you’re having? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, you get to enjoy it without it determining too much of what your 
experience will be. That way you can again have co-consciousness. If you just 
say well he told me not to and then just carry on with what he told me to do, 
that can lead to unhealthy places, like I heard a voice in my mind and it told 
me to do it. Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
One of the safeguards against going in that direction again is equanimity. 
Don’t take anything too seriously but at the same time don’t dismiss it either. 
It’s the same balance point as before. Does that help you? 
 
Student: Yes, I think it was because at that time he said don’t mind him, there will be 
more time. I think he meant like the rest of the people won’t be back yet 
anyway. 
 
Igor: 
That’s just fine because if you can come back nice and quickly, it’s no big deal, 
so you can get your job done. I also appreciate that our timings here are 
artificial. I only have a certain amount of time to get the content I want to 
share with you across. 
 
 
If we run out of time, then I can’t share all the content. Hence, I have to 
create artificial time limits for you to be able to continue on. When you do 
this practice on your own, you get to choose. If you have the whole day you 
can say I’ll stick around, I have the whole day. 
 
 
If you have to get to a business meeting, you say I’d love to hear you out, so 
let’s pick this up again tonight but right now I’ve got to make some money so 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
480 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that I can feed my family. You have to be able to create that balance point 
again. 
 
 
There’s another place we can get unhealthily addicted to, and I know people 
in the self-improvement field who are so addicted to themselves and their 
process that they neglect everyone around them as a result.  
 
 
It would be very unhelpful of me to help you master a skill set that makes you 
feel fantastic but destroys your life in the process. Does that make sense? 
 
Student: Yes. Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Of course I know that wasn’t quite the question you asked. I’m elaborating on 
a bigger point because of the opportunity you presented to me, so I 
appreciate that. Thank you. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: It sort of gets back to my earlier question about recurring themes but this 
time I found there’s a recurring theme that’s causing lack of stability in my 
mentalizations.  
 
 
What is basically is I tend to always start off in a stable place and I can see 
everything, and then I go barreling down somewhere and I end up in a new 
landscape. What’s been happening sometimes is I get in that landscape but 
then I find the ground giving way, going deeper. 
 
 
As an example, this time at one point I was entering a town but it was deeper, 
and I ended up going down a big hill in a small cart. A policeman said stop and 
I want to interact with him but I couldn’t because I was barreling down. 
 
 
Then I ended up at the bottom of the town. I found there was a beach and 
there were people talking and having a party. I wanted to interact with them 
but I just found myself being sucked down the shore of the beach. 
 
Igor: 
Allow me to pause you. Let me just present you with some possibilities of 
what might be going on there. What it sounds a bit like what’s going on is that 
it’s a subtle avoidance mechanism.

In other words, you’re very close to the interaction that you want, but for 
some reason maybe your balance is not quite in the right place yet, so your 
unconscious is basically saying okay we’re not doing the interactions, so 
here’s the offer.  
 
 
However, maybe it’s over-controlling. Maybe your comfort isn’t quite there 
yet. I’m not quite sure what it is. So, you go past your opportunity and it’s like 
oh I haven’t control anymore. 
 
 
It’s the same control versus letting go dynamic going on, but it’s being 
presented to you symbolically. So, you’re very close to success but for 
whatever reason – probably not quite knowing where that balance point is 
yet, which of course doesn’t help you very much in terms of how you resolve 
it, right? 
 
Student: Right. 
 
Igor: 
Would you like to play very quickly with an idea to do that? 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
This is very simple. Go ahead and close your eyes and keep your mic up 
because we need to interact. I need to be speaking with you. Just go ahead 
and recall the beach you were on with all those people.  
 
 
Do not attempt to approach them. Just recall the beach and see the over 
there. You can do that, can you not? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. So, then all you have to do is just sit with that for a moment, just 
very calmly or benignly, joyfully or whatever benign means to you, and it’s a 
pleasant experience knowing that you’re very close to the interaction that you 
seek, is it not? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Just with it without any hurry, without any rush. Now at some point one of 
two things may occur. Either someone in that party will approach you or

482 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
somehow signal to you, or it may seem more natural for you to begin to 
approach them. It doesn’t matter which occurs.  
 
 
What matters is that when it does, you tell me so that we can continue, and 
secondly that it’s just natural. It’s just a natural consequence of where you’re 
at.  
 
Student: The people are to my right side. To my left side I can see the sand dissolving 
near the water. 
 
Igor: 
So, pay attention to the people, which is your intention here. Can you see 
again the stability eroding because he’s trying to stabilize an unconscious 
environment and that’s a navigational issue? 
 
 
So, you’re paying to the people and notice that when you pay attention with it 
mindfully in a positive spirit shall we say, that most likely the eroding sand on 
the other side stabilizes again, but don’t pay attention to whether it does or 
not. 
 
Student: So, I’m just looking at them now.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Notice your attention is there. It’s benign, it’s stable and it’s calm. Do 
you have a sense of maybe a connection to those people in some way? In 
other words, now that you’re looking at them – in real life if you stare at 
people for a while, they tend to notice, right? 
 
Student: Yes, so I can see now they’re all sitting down for a meal.  
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: There’s an empty chair. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. Can you hear the invitation, folks? What I’d like you to do is just 
calmly approach them. Don’t attempt to take the chair yet. Just approach 
them and then when you get close to them, pause for a while and mindfully 
sit with that – or in this case stand with it – so again you get that sense of 
balance coming back. 
 
 
So, you approach them you might get a sense of instability or not – I don’t 
know – but when you start being mindful of it again, it will sure start being 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
483 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
natural also. Now can you begin to hear some of their conversations or at 
least the sounds that they’re making? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. So, maybe approach the chair and indicate to someone is this for 
me maybe? You don’t even have to say anything, just maybe through an 
indication or another. 
 
Student: Right.  
 
Igor: 
Good. How did they respond? 
 
Student: Yes, they’re all happy. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Go ahead and sit down. Now that you’ve joined the group, it would 
be polite to introduce yourself.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
What happen? 
 
Student: They say welcome. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. You’ve just started the interaction. What I’d like you to do is again 
politely take the next step. Maybe make a nice bit of chit-chat or say 
something, or maybe ask them a question like what are you guys doing here, 
or why are you here, or why are you on this beach waiting for me – because 
clearly they were – and notice what they say. 
 
Student: They just say we’re enjoying ourselves. 
 
Igor: 
Sit with that idea and if a feeling begins to emerge, let me know. Otherwise 
just hang out with them enjoying themselves. 
 
Student: So, I feel I want to say okay I’m going to enjoy myself too. 
 
Igor: 
I think you should, and are you? 
 
Student: Yes.

Igor: 
Good. Now that you’ve had a satisfying interaction – albeit a small one – it’s 
time to have an exchange of gifts. They’ve offered you something already in 
terms of the experience, so offer them something in return.  
 
 
You may offer them something spontaneous that just comes to mind – or to 
hand in this case – or you may ask them if there’s something that you could 
offer them that they would like, whichever you prefer. 
 
Student: What I just feel is a flower appeared in my hand. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And I give it to them. 
 
Igor: 
Present them with the flower and how do they react? 
 
Student: They’re happy.  
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now ask for a gift in return. 
 
Student: They give me a book. 
 
Igor: 
Take the book. If you wish to leaf through it leaf through it. Otherwise just 
appreciate it and thank them for it. 
 
Student: Yes, I say it seems very interesting and I thank them and sit down. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful. Sit with that for a while. You’ve had a very good interaction up to 
this point, so just sit with that for a while. Kind of like the integration 
breathing, let the scene continue for a bit and you can just be part of it 
without having to do too much with it. Just sit with that for a while and enjoy 
the experience, and of course the book that was given as a gift. 
 
 
In due course let me know whether it feels complete enough for you to return 
or if there’s something missing, something else you’d like to do before you do 
return. 
 
Student: That’s pretty much it. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
485 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Good. In that case, as is polite when you’re leaving company, thank everyone, 
say goodbye and maybe you’ll come back and visit sometime. In whatever 
way you wish to, bring yourself back to this room. 
 
Student: Okay, that’s good. 
 
Igor: 
Did you see what happened there? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The rushing is basically your mind – or at least probably part of your conscious 
mind – this is where the construct conscious and unconscious starts falling 
apart a little bit. You do realize when I talk about the unconscious, it is a 
construct, it’s a metaphor that helps us to understand what we’re trying to do 
here.  
 
 
At this point it’s starting to fall apart a little bit because all that’s happening is 
you’re so eager for the interaction that you’re trying to force it a little bit and 
your unconscious mind not liking that force is saying okay we’ll begin the 
interaction now, slide on down the hill because you tried a bit too hard there. 
 
 
And that’s what the stabilizing process is about. Notice how when you used 
the mindfulness again how much you stabilize it and how increment by 
increment you built up the interaction to something that was hopefully quite 
satisfying. Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Did that help answer your question? 
 
Student: Yes, I just was wondering too when I was passing by the policeman, should I 
have stuck my foot out of the car and came to a grinding halt? 
 
Igor: 
There will be a million different ways. You can stick your foot out of the car. 
You could do a James Bond roll-out of the car. You could get down the hill and 
then walk back up the hill and that took a bit of effort, but here I am. 
 
 
 
You could say hey, meet me down there, I’m just on my way. Who knows? 
That’s part of your process. That’s part of what you need to learn in terms of 
your mind, but hopefully this little experience you just had will give you a 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
486 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
sense of the nature of or the quality of how to stabilize a spontaneous 
interaction. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, that’s good. 
 
Igor: 
Was this useful to you guys as well? Thank you for that. I appreciate that. Are 
there any other comments on that? 
 
Student: Just a question about the difference or the similarities between the 
integration breathing and the equanimity. 
 
Igor: 
They are in some respects synonymous. In other words, the integration 
breathing is just hanging out with whatever is going on without any attempt 
to do anything in particular.  
 
 
The idea of equanimity is whatever is going on is okay. You have benign 
attention on it. The integration breathing is one way to develop equanimity. 
Another way is a good place bad place because you’re part of the experience, 
you’re observing the experience but you’re not being consumed by the 
experience.  
 
 
This gentleman over here when he starts to come back on his terms rather 
than the landscape’s terms because other needs demand his attention, he’s 
practicing equanimity and as long as he leaves not with oh I’m really sorry I’ve 
got to go now – that’s not equanimity.  
 
 
But on the flipside he’s saying thank you for the offer but it’s time for me to 
go now, and he’s calm, he’s benevolent and he leaves on those sorts of terms, 
then he has practiced equanimity.  
 
 
Equanimity is that state of mind. The mindful breathing is one way to help you 
develop it. The breathing count is another way. The mindful movement is 
another way. Any mindful exercise helps build equanimity because you are 
involved and yet not over-involved in the experience. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
In due course this is where the good place bad place comes in. You can 
intensify the unpleasantness of experiences purely to build your equanimity 
muscle. Remember I told you about some Buddhist monks who meditate on 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
487 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
death to scare the living daylights out of themselves because they need a 
bigger voltage to have a bigger level of equanimity. 
 
 
All right, this is kind of a warm-up exercise for what we want to do. Did most 
of you have some form of interaction with internal landscapes? I realize some 
of you may not have had it and some of you may have had the experience as 
Robin over here, where you’re close to the interaction but it kind of eludes 
you, it escapes you. It’s kind of like a dream again in that sense. 
 
 
Hopefully the little exercise we did in terms of stabilizing it and incrementally 
approaching things with a lot of mindfulness equanimity in between, that 
takes that desperation or that neediness out, which is where the force would 
normally come from. 
 
 
The reason I want to emphasize this is because we’re going to start using this 
in terms of a practical purpose, and if you’re not quite there yet today that’s 
okay. You have the rest of your life to master this as a skill.  
 
 
Just take the next few exercises in your stride and let them be whatever they 
are, knowing that you can always come back and work through the 
foundational levels again to create more stability and spontaneity hand in 
hand. 
 
Fantasy v Mental Reality 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like you to very quickly is everyone just close your eyes. No need to 
do anything mindful. This is a very quick thing. With your eyes closed all I 
want you to do is mentally twiddle your thumbs, just mentally inside of your 
mind. So, it’s a mentalization. 
 
 
You can stop that now. Now I want you to compare that to mentally doing a 
mindful movement, whatever you were doing before. Typically it’s a squat 
because most of you have been doing that for most of the time – the chair 
squat – but if you’ve been doing something else like a dynamic tension or 
something like that, just recreate that in your mentalization. 
 
 
When you’ve had enough of an experience of that, come on back with our 
eyes open so that you can compare the two experiences. Very briefly, did you 
notice a distinction or a different between the two mental processes that you 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
488 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
just engaged in? Would you please stand up and have a little chat about what 
the difference was for you? 
 
Student: In my experience the thumb went really quick and the squat went really slow. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Can you do the thumb twiddle slow? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Is it easier or harder than the squat? 
 
Student: It could be the same. 
 
Igor: 
Good. What other things did you guys notice? 
 
Student: The experience of the thumb twiddling was theoretically it’s easy to imagine, 
but the squat was almost like I did it for real. I could feel it in my muscles. 
 
Igor: 
So, the quality was different. It was more vivid doing the squat that you’ve 
been doing before, whereas the twiddling was somehow less real, although it 
was easy to imagine. Would that be fair to say? 
 
Student: For sure, yes. 
 
Igor: 
How many people experienced that in particular? Hands up. So, that was part 
of yours as well? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That reality tone is important to me. I’d like for you to now have the 
following experience. This is again about creating a reality tone in your 
mentalizations. Put your hands together and twiddle your thumbs. I want you 
to watch them intently and feel it. Change the speed and then pick it up. 
 
 
Whilst you’re doing that I want you to imagine or pretend or act as if you’re 
actually mentalizing it but you’re not actually doing it physically. This is 
actually your mentalization. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

When you’ve done that for a few moments, close your eyes and continue that 
motion. Then you can stop the physical hands moving and only your mental 
hands continue the motion. 
 
 
When you’ve had a few moments of doing that, open your eyes and we’ll 
have the mics ready again. How did that one compare to the previous version 
of the same mentalization? Hands up. It was much stronger?  
 
Student: The first time I did the twiddling of thumbs I actually found it a bit difficult, 
but that time as I was doing it physically and then when I was mentalizing it, it 
was like it continued afterwards. Like whenever you’re sailing or something 
and you get off the boat and you still feel like you’re on it. 
 
Igor: 
The afterglow sort of thing, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Now this is important because what I want to do in this session now 
is I want to focus on how do you improve skills? One of the things you need to 
have with a skill is an experience. How many people in this room have ever 
played a bagpipe? Two people? Wow. I was trying to really come up with a 
difficult one. 
 
 
If I asked you all to mentally rehearse playing the bagpipes, you’d be most 
likely entering a pure fantasy because you have no experience of it. There’s no 
visceral experience of even holding a bagpipe.  
 
 
Who even knows what a bagpipe feels like to touch, let alone hold, let alone 
play? It’s not many people. I probably shouldn’t be asking this in Ireland. 
Maybe I should go with a sitar, but then we have our Indian contingency, 
exactly. I’m screwed either way. 
 
 
You get the picture here, right? The reason mentalizing the thumb twiddle 
afterwards was easier is because you had an actual physical experience. Very 
much like Simon had on the very first day where he mentalized his hotel room 
and it wasn’t quite accurate, and as soon as he walked in everything pops 
back out at him and corrects itself and becomes more vivid as a result.

By doing having attempted to do it mentally, suddenly your attention arrests 
on it more so that when you close your eyes again, you have a better quality 
of information to mentally rehearse. Does that make sense? 
 
 
Whilst it is possible for example to predispose yourself to becoming good at 
playing the piano for example – if you’ve ever touched a piano – if your body 
has no concept of the pressure on the keys, how much pressure I needs to go 
down, the distance between the keys and the keyboard and so on, and the 
sounds it makes and that sort of stuff, the tendency will be to go towards 
pure fantasy. 
 
 
There’s a way to correct that and hopefully we’ll have time to talk about that 
today. It’s not really relevant to what we’re doing here. But once you sat 
down at the piano and started playing around a little bit and then closing your 
eyes and practicing mentally, it becomes a lot easier just like your thumb 
twiddle because easier after you did a physical practice. 
 
 
There’s kind of a split in the visualization community. On the one side you 
have the sports psychologists who use mental rehearsals just like this to help 
people become very, very good at their given sport, and there’s lots of 
research and lots of data to show how much just mental rehearsal will 
increase physical performance.  
 
 
On the other side – and I’m not going to paint the whole New Age community 
in the same color but there is a portion of that that believes that just by 
mentally rehearsing something you didn’t have an experience of, it will come 
to pass like that. So, you can mentally play the piano and the first time you sit 
at the piano it will be perfect.  
 
 
But it’s missing reality. It’s missing the limitations of the piano that you have 
to be working with. There’s a way to cheat around that but as I say we’ll see if 
we can discuss that later if we’ve got time for it.  
 
 
Really when we want to improve a skill of some sort, it helps to have a portion 
of physical feedback and mental rehearsal. If we get the right proportions 
from the two, your ability to increase the skill accelerates dramatically. Do 
you see where I’m going with this?

The Practice Room 
 
Igor: 
So, I’d like for you to choose a skill or a task that you’d like to have some 
improvement upon. Now given what we’ve just had, that task should of 
course be something you already have some experience of.  
 
 
Not something like I wish I could do X. If you can’t play the flute and you say I 
wish I could play the flute, that is not the one I’m talking about. If you’ve kind 
of tinkered with the piano or you’re trying to play a little song and there’s a 
little part of it that you can’t quite get, that would be an excellent one to be 
using for this.  
 
 
Ideally it should be a physical skill just for the moment because it’s easier to 
mentalize a physical skill than a more amorphous skill like an intellectual skill 
for example. Do you all have a skill like that in mind? Good. 
 
 
We’re going to go through a classical mental rehearsal process in a non-
classical way – in other words in our own mentalized ASH Method sort of way. 
All I’m going to ask you to do is go through whatever entrance you want – in 
other words do whatever mindful exercise you need to build up some 
attention.  
 
 
Then allow your unconscious mind to take you to any landscape that’s 
pleasant because we may as well start somewhere pleasant. Once you’re 
there, ask your unconscious mind to take you to another landscape, this one 
being a perfect room to rehearse this skill in.  
 
 
In other words, if your skill is the piano it should have a piano in it. Do you get 
the idea? I used to do this with martial arts of course. I would take my dojo, 
the studio I would be training in, and that would be my rehearse room 
because that’s an appropriate place to do it in.  
 
 
So, it’s a very simple process. The only difference is rather than directly 
deciding which room you’re going to rehearse in, I’d like for you to allow your 
unconscious mind to create the room for you. Once you’re there, just practice 
the skill a little bit and then come on back. Don’t take too long with this 
because we have a lot more to build on top of it. 
 
 
All right, whenever you’re ready go into your normal closing protocol. Was 
that interesting? Relatively simple, right? Who’s tried that kind of mental 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

rehearsal stuff before? Hands up. It’s a very common technique. Who found 
that this version was somehow more vivid or compelling than the ones you’ve 
tried in the past? 
 
 
I hope you’re beginning to understand why now. It’s because your capacity to 
understand that the balance points between conscious and unconscious is 
that much more refined. Are there any comments in terms of what you’ve 
experienced so far? 
 
Student: I found that this time as opposed to just sort of forcing a mental rehearsal, my 
unconscious mind brought up ways to do it better.  
 
Igor: 
Excellent. You’re ahead of the game. That’s in the next step as well. I like that. 
Did anyone else have that sense that it was more natural to try different 
things out that you haven’t done in the past?  
 
Student: I chose some choreography that I had learned a long time ago and never done 
just working on stuff, and I ended up in a very different place than I would 
normally have practiced that choreography, and it was neat until I couldn’t 
stay there because I kept going to the place that I normally practice it. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, excellent. All that you’re experiencing there is the conflict between habit 
and spontaneity. Because you’re used to doing it in your normal place, there’s 
part of your mind that wants to follow the memory trace – choreography 
follows the memory trace to a location. The affect bridge is one.  
 
 
The land bridge is the other one. It’s the location bridge. That’s the one you 
experienced just now, but another part of your unconscious is actually 
enjoying the new place because the novelty of it is actually helping some 
freshness come in. That’s just a stability issue, which will resolve itself as you 
continue. 
 
Student: Well, I stopped for a little while with the choreography and worked on 
stabilizing the location. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. 
 
Student: And then I started working on the choreography and I had music running and 
what happened was I would scan through the choreography and then go back 
and forth and back and forth because I kept focusing on – like you’ve got one

hand doing one thing, one hand doing another thing, feet doing something 
else and I wouldn’t be able to keep track of all of them at the same time. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely, but you can isolate each one at a time and, almost like a mental 
movie, switch back and forth until it all looks correct. Is that right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Do you see the advantage of doing a mental rehearsal this way? I 
thank you for that as well in particular because you can do things inside your 
mind that you can’t do in real life.  
 
 
Let’s take the example of something that has inherent risk. Something like 
cliff-diving. If you dive from a cliff that’s a bit too high for you and you mess 
up the landing, that’s going to have a relatively unpleasant consequence, isn’t 
it?  
 
 
If you dive off a mental cliff and mess up the landing, well then you just die – 
and come back to life again of course. Who here found themselves slowing 
time down in order to be able to actually get that little skill, that little trick in?  
 
 
Once again, you can’t really slow time down in real life – actually you can but 
that’s not something for right now. It won’t slow down for everyone else. It 
will subjectively slow down. That’s the difference there. 
 
 
But when you’re doing it inside your mind, you have much more control over 
all the elements. Plus because you’re learning this co-conscious creation 
process, that’s where skills lie anyways.  
 
 
In other words, your conscious mind just looks at the big picture. Your 
unconscious mind does all the detailed work. If you doubt me, when you have 
lunch later on walk down the street and just question yourself constantly – 
how am I walking, which muscle should I move next, which foot – and if you 
can keep your balance, you’re better than I am. 
 
 
It’s different than walking mindfully – in other words just being aware of how 
is my foot currently walking, as opposed to how should I have my foot walk? 
You understand the difference in the questions is quite fundamental, right?

If you do nothing but this, your skills will improve significantly and with much 
less effort, but I’m not satisfied with the level at which sports psychology has 
reached. I think there are much better levels, which will improve your 
performances much more dramatically. 
 
 
Would you be willing to explore those with me? Just rest assured no matter 
how competent you are at this particular skill today, we promised you all an 
audio. I ran two people in my test group through this process and I recorded 
the whole process from start to finish, so you can hear them going from a skill 
that has eluded them for 10 years in about an hour or so of doing this kind of 
work.  
 
 
At the end of it they can do it beautifully and they’re just overwhelmed with 
it, and of course that has now escalated since the time that we worked 
together. You’ll get a chance to listen in on that as well, so you’ll have that a 
resource when you go home.  
 
The Mentor 
 
Igor: 
The next step is by creating a spontaneous environment, what you’ve done is 
basically allowed the unconscious mind to be invited to be part of the process. 
So, rather than forcing the mental rehearsal, you’re basically going to include 
all the limitations that your conscious mind has. You’re inviting your 
unconscious mind to include options that you would not normally consciously 
consider.  
 
 
The example that was discussed is a version of that. How would you like to be 
able to formalize this idea of trying things out or changing the rehearsal in a 
way that you would not normally consider but could be of great value to you? 
Would that be of use to you? 
 
 
Here are the instructions. It’s very simple. Once again however you want to 
enter your mentalization, go ahead and do that. That’s the first step. The 
second step, just as you did before, call up a mental rehearsal place.  
 
 
For the sake of practice, you’re welcome to go back to the place you just 
visited so you have a sense like we had over here with the beach that you can 
recreate environments you’ve already visited.

In other words, just because it’s only a mental landscape doesn’t mean that it 
can’t be as real as your home, and you can revisit it for the same sort of tasks. 
So, you can recreate that one or allow itself to recreate, or if you prefer to 
practice spontaneity allow your mind to take you wherever it wishes to. You 
have a choice here. 
 
 
Once you get there, by all means just do the task just a little bit just to kind of 
orient yourself into it, but here’s the extra bit. Basically up till now it’s pretty 
much the same as you’ve just done.  
 
 
The extra bit is once you’re there, once you’ve set yourself there, your 
mindful, the place is there and you’ve done a little bit of the skill just to kind 
of get yourself into the mood, ask your unconscious mind to send you a 
mentor. 
 
 
A mentor is a symbolic figure that you ascribe more knowledge to in terms of 
skills in terms of this thing than you currently possess or think you possess. 
When the mentor approaches, do your normal interaction – say welcome, 
introduce yourself if you need to or just hang out with them for a bit – and 
then start your mental rehearsal and ask your mentor to observe, at the end 
of which get feedback from them. 
 
 
Then whatever feedback they gave you, try it out. Some of your mentors may 
interfere and just tell you whilst you’re doing it. Then just carry on with it. Do 
you understand the nature of this exercise? 
 
 
It’s exactly what you did before. You’re just going to allow a symbolic mentor 
to enter. Again, don’t choose them. Ask for one to enter your scene. Then as 
you do the mental rehearsal, allow them to coach you, or at the end of it 
allow them to give you some feedback so that you can do it again 
incorporating that feedback. Do you understand what I’m asking you to do? 
Whenever you’re ready, off you go. 
 
 
All right, find a natural place to pause your interaction. What kind of things 
did you experience? Were there any surprises there? 
 
Student: I’m really glad what you said about the mentor because that’s what I 
visualized before in the previous one. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, good.

Student: I just heard this voice speaking to me from somewhere and I wasn’t sure. So, I 
was on a squash court practicing my squash skills. I had kind of like rubber 
legs at one point, so I was kind of stuck to the T part in the middle of the 
court, so you can always get to every ball.  
 
 
My legs were kind of stretching to get the ball, but then at some point I had a 
sort of camera zoom round to the front of me and the mentor actually 
assimilated himself into my body like he was doing the strokes with me. 
 
Igor: 
He took over for you, right? 
 
Student: Well, it was me doing it but it was kind of both of us doing it. It was very 
strange. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. That’s a great example of co-consciousness again. Go on. 
 
Student: That was it. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Excellent. Well done. Did you have a sense that your skill improved 
as a result?  
 
Student: Yes, absolutely. I felt like as I was doing the stroke that I was getting a perfect 
stroke. 
 
Igor: 
Very good. Excellent. What other things did you guys notice? 
 
Student: I think overall what I’m really liking about this is I do visualizations and I do a 
lot of dreaming and lucid dreaming, so I can do a lot of stuff in my dreams but 
I have to be asleep for it.  
 
 
This is giving a whole new range of being able to do it while awake, but still in 
that kind of dream state where normally I would be forcing and creating it 
rather than discovering it. So, that’s really cool. 
 
Igor: 
Good. I’m glad to hear it. Thank you very much for that. Are there any other 
experiences you want to share? 
 
Student: That was productive for me but I have a question that’s related to this 
exercise, to go back.

Igor: 
Absolutely, please. 
 
Student: Nobody speaks unless it’s in the first person, so I can change to that person 
and speak but the third people don’t talk. 
 
Igor: 
That’s just fine. That’s just something you’re learning to stabilize. 
Spontaneous speech in the mentalization is an additional skill. It’s the same 
sort of skill as having a spontaneous landscape but for a lot of people it 
requires a little bit of extra trust or confidence or experience to generate. 
 
 
If your way of generating it initially is to switch perspectives, by all means do 
so. In time you can hone it towards actually having an interaction as though 
you’re having an interaction out here with people. It’s just an additional skill. 
 
 
Let’s put it this way. There’s a great taboo in our society against talking to 
voices in your head and that’s part of the taboo we have to break down 
skillfully so that it’s not just voices talking in our head, but they’re actually 
practical and useful, not telling you to do stuff that would be antisocial.  
 
Student: Indeed. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. You’re in exactly the right place. By the way, how many 
people here noticed their mentor didn’t even speak? You didn’t actually get 
any speech at all. Hands up.  
 
 
You’re in exactly the right place. That’s just another function of the co-
conscious interaction. For some reason, some people have more problems 
with speech than with other things, and that’s just a skill that will develop as 
you practice.  
 
Student: It’s been a very different morning. It’s been fun, but this last one – there were 
some dance steps I had to learn. We’re going on a tour and I have no idea 
because I’ve missed all the practices, but I was there and I found this place 
and then I asked for a mentor, and this lady came over and I told her I have to 
learn this dance. 
 
 
Then all the sudden the music came and like it’s with a partner and the 
partner’s far away and they come close and this is happening, and then I have 
no idea what I was doing but the partner made the odd mistake, but I just fit 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
498 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
right in and did my thing and I have no idea what I was doing, so I find that a 
bit strange, and I won’t know until I go back if something happened. 
 
Igor: 
Sure, and remember just a five-minute rehearsal doesn’t necessarily change 
everything at once. We’re still building a process here, at the end of which 
you’ll see some hopefully interesting things happening. 
 
 
I’d like to speak a little bit towards just this exercise on its own. Remember I 
told you I think on the first day how one of the processes we did here saved 
two people’s lives – actually one of our students and another lady. This is the 
exercise they did.  
 
 
In the practice room he chose as a still that little combative drill we’d done a 
few months before and just he you rehearsed and it was fine, and when the 
mental came of course it was me because I taught him in the first place, so it 
was odd for me talk to myself in someone else’s mind. 
 
 
I was very pleasantly surprised – although is surprise is more important than 
mine – but I was very pleasantly surprised that all the advice the mentor was 
giving him in terms things to correct were exactly the same things I would 
have said. So, I thought I’ll shut up and you just carry on. You’re doing your 
job. 
 
 
Remember, he did practice this five minutes here, 10 minutes there and so 
on. I think at times there was a lot of down time. They might have spent like 
20 minutes or a half an hour or so, but for the most part it would just be five 
minutes here, 10 minutes there, wherever there was spare time. 
 
 
Over the course of a couple of months – and again that time element is useful 
– so he hadn’t practiced a huge amount. It was under 10 hours he said. When 
the actual event happened, we thought it would never occur because he was 
just doing it for the fun of it.  
 
 
His mind just kicked in to do exactly the same process, but of course he has to 
let go in the outside world in the same way as he needed to let go on the 
inside world because really his unconscious mind was taking over. It’s that co-
conscious part again. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
499 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It’s not like he just took a back seat. It wasn’t as though when the actual 
emergency occurred he had no involvement at all, like a dream and his body 
was moving on its own.  
 
 
He was still doing it, but there’s that co-conciousness again where it just 
seemed right and he knew exactly what to do, where to do it and the timing 
was perfect. It was almost like he could predict everything more easily. Does 
that make sense? 
 
 
That was just on this exercise alone and this isn’t the best one yet. We’ll come 
onto that shortly but there’s a question or a comment here first. 
 
Student: It’s a comment actually. I found that whenever I’m over-controlling or under-
controlling that if I tilt my hat to either side or I look up slightly and smile, 
then I give into the experience more and the images become more stable or 
fluid or whatever I need really. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations and importantly notice how as you practice these 
mentalizations, they teach you to get better instincts about what will work for 
you. Not everyone here will suddenly be able to do this and it works better for 
them.  
 
 
That’s your idiosyncrasy but the important point is just the experience of 
doing it teaches how to do it better. Do you get the idea? Thank you. I 
appreciate you saying that. 
 
The Expert 
 
Igor: 
All right, let’s move on then to the next level. We’ve done two levels of the 
mental rehearsal. The first level is really the level at which most sports 
psychology ends.  
 
 
You’ve actually done a little bit more by introducing the unconscious 
environment, which allows the unconscious mind to express itself a little bit 
more, but typically speaking most psychologists pretty much leave at this 
point. There’s some other stuff they do of course as well. I’m not going to try 
to diminish their profession too much. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
500 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The second level is something that I think maybe some sports psychologists 
may do, but I haven’t really come across it very much. But again by adding 
that element, that factor of co-consciousness – letting the unconscious mind 
tutor you – put your hands up if you had a sense of an increase in skill just in 
the last few minutes that you would not other have gained. Excellent. 
 
 
So, let’s see if we can make more of that. What I’d like you to do now is once 
again enter your practice room. If you wish to have a brief practice just to kind 
of set yourself up, by all means do so but make it brief. If your mentor is 
present again, leave them present or not. We’re going to keep coming back to 
this a few times to add pieces. 
 
 
The important thing is whenever you feel ready for it, I’d like for you to ask for 
another figure to appear. This time someone who you know or if you want to 
be surprised you can be surprised by it too, someone who is an expert at the 
exact skill you’re trying to improve upon – so an expert pianist, an expert 
fencer, an expert painter, etc. 
 
 
All you’re going to do is observe them doing the very skill that you want to be 
improving upon. The more precise you can define that skill of course the more 
clear the results of this particular experiment will be for you. 
 
 
Do you understand what we’re talking about here? You’re not actually going 
to do anything. You’re just going to observe the actual event. Whilst you’re 
observing it, if you recall when we talked about the landscapes and we talked 
about the leaf with the droplet and so on, just take a few moments maybe 
when it’s over or maybe whilst you’re watching it to point out to yourself 
some of the things that you’re seeing – oh he’s doing this, oh this is 
interesting.  
 
 
Some of you if you have your mentor present, he may want to point some 
things out for you to watch as well. That’s just fine. I’m not going to constrain 
you too much.  
 
 
What’s important to me is that you’re in the environment watching the expert 
or asking for an expert to come in, watching the expert doing their thing and 
you observe it intently.

Whether or not the mentor assists you in that observational by pointing 
things out, that’s entirely up to you – or actually it’s entirely up to your 
unconscious. Are you all clear on the exercise?  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
All right, pause proceedings for a little while. Thank all of the figures involved 
and then go through a closing process to come back to the room. 
 
Student: I’ve got two questions. 
 
Igor: 
Please go ahead. 
 
Student: Number one, when the expert comes, would that be a possibility that the one 
who’s experiencing it actually gets frustrated, that the skill of the expert 
who’s doing whatever they’re looking for? 
 
Igor: 
I presume that the answer is yes because it just happened to you, possibly in 
theory. The answer is yes, which is one of the reasons we waited to do this 
exercise until we had thoroughly explored the idea of equanimity, the idea of 
benign attention. 
 
 
The reason that you have frustration is typically the exact reason why you’re 
not performing at that level because that’s part of the bridge, the barrier to 
get through. So, when that frustration comes up, you can always pause 
proceedings and then sit with that. Just allow it to do its thing. 
 
 
With all emotions, they go in waves. They’ll intensify and intensify and reach a 
peak and then diminish. If it’s a chronic emotion or a chronic state – in other 
words it’s always there, it repeats, repeats, repeats – if at the end of that 
cycle you start adding value judgment like this is bad, oh my God it’s 
happening again and so on, when it comes back again it will come back with 
the same intensity or maybe even more because you’ve added fuel to your 
fire. 
 
 
If on the other hand you are observing it with equanimity, with benign 
attention, each reiteration of that wave will get slower and lower and lower 
until it pretty much flattens out. That’s just the nature of things if you just 
look at the biochemistry of emotion. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
502 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That wave will at last the longest on the outside for 90 seconds. I think if it 
was Candace who was talking about the emotional wave, but there’s another 
researcher who name escapes me at the moment who also is in a very similar 
field, but the point is not the research. This is a biochemical fact – or at least 
as close to a fact as we can get to right now.  
 
 
That’s the purpose of equanimity right there. If you do nothing else with that 
point other than let the frustration wave pan out – in other words flatten out 
– that in itself should do a huge amount to your skill levels. Does that help 
answer the question? 
 
Student: Yes. The second question is how do you deal with it when the skill is not an 
outside skill? 
 
Igor: 
That’s a bit more complex. 
 
Student: Most of the time when I talk about dancing or whatever, but what about a 
skill like I want to be better at mindfulness meditation?  
 
Igor: 
Can you pause that question until after the lunch break. 
 
Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
We’re going to work up towards an answer to that, but the skill that I’m 
asking you for here specifically should be a physical skill precisely to avoid that 
dilemma for now. 
 
Student: Just an interesting experience. I asked how to become a better 
hypnotherapist in my practice, and I got Milton Erickson, which was very nice. 
 
Igor: 
That’s always a good one to have. Send my regards. I see him a lot of times 
too. 
 
Student: Well, I’ve never seen him on a video before, so I don’t really know. 
 
Igor: 
His picture is on one of those things out there. 
 
Student: Yes, I saw that. I watched him do the violet story with the lady with the 
violets, and he basically goes to her house and he walks around the house 
with her and observes her plants and just talks to her in general.

He says to her to share her violets with families who are in need or have had a 
hard time, and so she goes… 
 
Igor: 
Or a celebration as well – weddings and other places. 
 
Student: Yes, and she goes and she starts to do that. I didn’t see that in the story but 
the moral of the story is she was quite lively before she started doing this, and 
the more she did it the more healing she got I guess within the community 
within herself, and the message I got out of that was sometimes the healing 
isn’t always instant. It takes a bit of time, and that was a good learning. 
 
Igor: 
And that is a huge insight in this field.  
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Especially in hypnotherapy because as hypnotherapists we’re a little addicted 
to instant results to validate – look, I did a good job, look it’s fixed. Being okay 
with not being an instant fix took me such a long time to be okay with and 
even now there are times I’m a little challenged by it, so it’s a wonderful, 
wonderful insight to have. Thank you for that. 
 
Arthur: 
I was practicing the classical guitar and I found that if I knew the song, then I 
could practice it but if it was a song that I didn’t know, then it didn’t help. I 
couldn’t do that. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Once again it goes back to what we talked about with the thumb 
twiddle. If you don’t know the song, then it’s like not being connected to 
twiddling your thumb. As you practice the known more, then those sorts of 
things will become more intuitive also. 
 
 
What will tend to happen is as you focus on the songs you know and you get 
that skill, then the next stage of the skill may well be something like you try 
the song you don’t know yet in the real world and you realize maybe the first 
few chords you’re not entirely sure about, but you have enough knowledge 
now to go inside and rehearse those and make it quicker, make it easier, more 
natural and so on, so then your rate of progression through that song will 
increase.

Now the first time you may have to work through the song segment by 
segment to build that up. You have to micro-manage each piece. Once you’ve 
done a number of songs those segments will become larger and larger and 
eventually you’ll get to the point where you can do what’s called in the music 
industry playing it by ear.  
 
 
That is a skill. What’s playing it by ear mean? It basically means someone’s 
trusting their unconscious to put their – in the sense of the guitar – fingers in 
the right place to make the sounds sound like when they hear the song. 
 
 
That’s something you can work up towards. Again it’s a skill – the Law of 
Successive Approximations – start with small easy wins and build up to larger 
and larger wins. Are there any other comments or questions on that? 
 
Student: I’ve done this exercise before as a sort of NLP version of it and in comparison 
it was almost paint-by-numbers and this one had the emotion and passion 
coming into it, which added a completely new dimension to the experience. It 
was very moving. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you very much. That’s kind of the point of it, right? If you’d like to take 
that emotion and passion and the results you’re getting and amp it up a notch 
– would anyone be interested in that idea? We have several more notches by 
the way on our belt here. 
 
The Expert 2 
 
Igor: 
Here’s what I’d like you to do. Very quickly you’re going to go back inside and 
recreate the environment you just did – in other words watching the expert – 
but wait a second before you start the experience.  
 
 
In essence you’re going to repeat the exact same exercise. So, get to the point 
where the expert is there and you’re observing him and maybe your mentor is 
kind of pointing things out and so on. 
 
 
Here’s the only addition I would like you to make. When you’re observing this 
person, I would like you to start off by observing all them, just their general 
mannerisms and the whole thing.

Then I’d like you to focus just on their face whilst they’re doing the task or the 
skill, and then their breathing or tone. What do I mean by that? If it’s a talking 
skill like hypnotherapy, so words are involved, just listen to the rhythm of 
their words, their tonality and so on. 
 
1. Observe All 
2. Observe Face 
3. Observe Breathing/Tonality 
4. Observe All 
 
 
If it’s singing, it would be similar. You can listen to their tonality, their rhythm 
and so on – the quality of their voice. If it’s a silent task – for example playing 
squash or playing chess or something like that – just watch the quality and 
rhythm of their breathing instead. 
 
 
You can watch it in terms of the rise and fall of their chest and whatever else 
you want to do. Then check out the whole of their body – in other words 
what’s their body doing? Aside from their face, what’s their body doing whilst 
their face is doing other things? 
 
 
In particular if there’s a part of the body that’s particularly involved in that 
activity – for example with playing the guitar it will be their hands – focus in 
on their hands, but then the whole body and then the hands, so that you have 
that contrast. Once you’ve done that, go back to the whole thing.  
 
 
So, we start with everything. We’ll focus in on the head. We’ll focus in 
specifically on their breathing pattern or the tonality and rhythms, which is 
basically the breathing pattern with sound. 
 
 
Then you’re going to focus on what their body is doing, and if there’s a 
particular area that is of importance, then you’ll focus on that also as part of 
that whole cycle. 
 
 
Then you’ll have the whole picture again. That’s the complete cycle, and then 
we’ll come back again and we’ll have lunch. We haven’t entirely finished this 
yet. There are a couple more stages to this, but this is already going to be 
quite trippy for you I think.

All right, just allow the experience to come to a natural pause point. Thank all 
the people involved of course, and then find your normal way back to hear 
your closing procedure, so we can discuss that. 
 
Student: I would like just to say that I went to the expert to observe her just writing, 
and I had x-ray eyes so I could see her underwear and her style of stockings in 
doing that exercise, and it was very interesting just to sit there and observing 
the face and the breathing.  
 
 
She was in a trance and I was very surprised because I didn’t expect either to 
visit her nor to notice she was in a trance, but I think in the end what was the 
most interesting was coming back here into the room. I had a very strong arm. 
 
Igor: 
Do you still have a sense of that emotion right now? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, just sit with that for a while. Just let that sort of settle in. Sit with it. 
Remember whether it’s good or it’s bad, as long as there’s an emotion always 
sit with it because it helps build that internal contact, and of course the other 
thing it does is it ensures you’re not consumed by the emotion whether it’s 
good or bad, either way. Thank you. Just take your time to do that as we carry 
on elsewhere. Thank you for that. 
 
 
Overall did you guys notice that you had a higher quality of experience when 
you started observing the various things we talked about here than the 
observations you had previously?  
 
 
Put your hands up if you noticed that was an overall richer experience, you 
noticed more things and so on. It goes right back to what we talked about on 
the very first day, when we went from mindful breathing to the mindful 
counting of breathing.  
 
 
The task has become clearer here, which means you have now more valuable 
information coming out, so it’s easier and actually more is happening at the 
same time. Do you understand what I’m saying here?  
 
Student: I had an interesting experience in that I had an unsolicited thought pop, a 
completely different teacher that gave me advice that was so key at the time.

Igor: 
Awesome, and that’s one of the reasons we have to work with that 
spontaneity, that surprise and all the rest of it because otherwise that can’t 
happen. Awesome. Good job. Well done.  
 
 
So, overall did you enjoy that exercise? We’re not complete yet. There are a 
few more steps here that I want to do with you guys, but those steps relate to 
the material we’ll be doing this afternoon, which will be more about personal 
healing and so on, but they still relate to skills, so the skill will be the bridge 
between the two. 
 
 
Keep these practice rooms in the back of your mind because we’ll be revisiting 
them after lunch, but before we do that fuel up so that you can get back in 
with lots of energy and get the work done. Can we just take about an hour for 
lunch? This way we can finish on time without actually eating into our 
exercise time.

DVD 15 – Deep Trance Identification 
Progression Part 2 & The Transformation 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back everyone. How are you doing? Did you enjoy the stuff we were 
doing before the break? Let’s just see if you have any questions in terms of 
the process so far.  
 
 
We’re just about at the point to do something quite revolutionary with it, 
which you may not have thought about before, hopefully. If you have, then 
hopefully it will be more intense and surprising than you had considered 
before.  
 
 
Before we go down that road, let’s just throw the floor open to any questions 
that you may have about the process so far. 
 
Student: I had a question to the intention that you were talking about. Do you have any 
exercise or any experience you could give us that we could experience what 
you were talking about or what you were meaning about this intention stuff, 
just like I intended it and it didn’t really work? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. The way you see it in action was by healing the rift, right? A simple way 
to do that is for example let’s say you were going to do a mindful movement 
like a push-up or a squat. The way to connect the two together again is to 
preview it, which is basically to create an intention about a future action.  
 
 
So, I’ll about I’ll have to get up, I’m standing up, I sit down, stand up and then 
immediately following that, I’ll actually do it and then if I really want to 
cement it in, afterwards I’ll review it to compare the two and say okay that 
was good. 
 
 
That simple act on its own won’t of course heal all your intentionality but it 
begins that process. Then on a more subtle level when you’re learning to 
navigate through the inner landscapes, intention becomes a very important 
thing.

For example, when you say I’d like to see a forest or I’d like to see a natural 
scene, please take me there – that’s intention in action and in fact that’s the 
right balance where you evoke or call for a type of place and the specifics are 
furnished by your unconscious. 
 
 
All of you were practicing intentionality when you called in a mentor or an 
expert and that individual arrived, especially of course if it was a surprising 
one. Does that make sense?  
 
 
In some respects it’s just following up on your word, having your actions suit 
your word. This is something that used to be a very big deal in the 19th 
Century and some of the preceding centuries of the Enlightenment period, 
but it started getting radically eroded during the 20th Century and now we 
don’t even think about it. 
 
 
We give lip service about being true to your word or things like that, but many 
people don’t really do anything about it anymore. If they don’t, it’s like oh 
well it’s okay.  
 
 
An exercise I came across that was interesting – it has nothing to do with here 
but just to answer your question – was by Benjamin Franklin. He used to carry 
around this little slate with – I believe it was the seven vices or something like 
that or his personal vices. 
 
 
He was trying to eradicate them and he would tick every time he practiced a 
particular virtue, and every time he gave into a vice he would record it and so 
on. So, he would have a record each week of how well he did in his battle 
against the vices. 
 
 
Whilst he never managed to have a clean sheet, the act on its own he said 
many years afterwards made him a much better person, but then again you 
have to speak to intentionality. Does that make sense? 
 
Student: So, basically you’re saying you just have to learn to follow up on your 
intention because you said before attention is different from intention, just 
setting the intention like oh yeah I might do it or not, because I do not know 
really the intention of having this really burning desire as you said. 
 
Igor: 
The example I gave you was more to make it obvious because if your senses 
are dull to an experience, you’ve got to make a very obvious example to make 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

it easier for everyone to recognize the creature. Most intentions tend to be 
very small. 
 
 
A basic version of intention is when you’re hungry and you go to the fridge 
and get some food, but then that’s driven by the drives also. The easy one is 
to say something like I’ll send you an email with that when I get home, and 
when you get home you say I have to send this email. I’m not going to put my 
feet up. I promised to do this and I will fulfill my word first and then I’ll let 
other things happen. Does that make sense? 
 
Student: Yes. Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
It’s sort of built into what we’re doing here anyways. In terms of the balance – 
and we’ll go into some more of that tomorrow as well – many of the 
mentalization exercises we’re doing here will teach you much more about 
that balance point because if you intend by force, you’re over-controlling. If 
you intend but don’t really follow up, then it starts falling apart and so on. 
 
 
 
So, your mentalizations already tell you if you have the right balance point on 
that. This hasn’t been around long enough for me to say yes, 1,000 people 
have done this for the last 10 years and 900 of them had this result. It’s too 
new for that.  
 
 
My anticipation is that people who practice this stuff regularly will become 
more intentful – in other words they will tend to follow up on the things 
they’ve decided to do or promised to do much more than they would 
previously have done, but I can’t make that as a claim because I don’t have 
the data to back it up yet. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. Thanks. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other questions about what we’ve done so far? 
 
Student: Hello. I just want to comment on what happened to me during the last 
exercise. I used to study classical singing and I’ve not done that for about two 
and a half years now. I used that intent in the last exercise and the very 
interesting thing is that I could feel my muscles line up in the way they used to 
and it would take me at least two hours before I got to that point, and by the 
end of the exercise I had already gotten there and gone past it.

I’m usually very disoriented after exercising in that way, and when I went out 
for lunch I had to go walk around to get my head back. It was really an 
amazing exercise. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for sharing that. Let me speak to that experience in particular. We 
now have wonderful machines like FMRI that actually sees the brain in action 
when it’s doing things. We’re going to use the classical language for this now. 
Intense visualizations will activate the motor cortex, the bit that actually runs 
your body. 
 
 
In fact it will also see often micro-muscular movements, so you’ll have little 
twitches in the arms and the legs and so on, depending on the task involved in 
it.  
 
 
For example, when a runner mentalizes or in their terminology would 
visualize running, the muscles in their legs would start twitching and working, 
and if they’re doing it correct, their body temperature should increase and a 
lot of them will start panting and maybe even start sweating because the 
body’s preparing. It’s getting involved in that particular experience. 
 
 
So, you actually are doing the work. The way we’re doing it here because 
we’re working directly with the unconscious rather than having to spend so 
much time visualizing, which is a more classical version of it, it’s a lot easier to 
get into it and get lost in it, and the unconscious mind takes over and of 
course it runs your body as well. 
 
 
So, it’s going to involve that also. This is one of the ways that you can improve 
skills very quickly because you can do things inside your mentalizations that 
you couldn’t do outside – for example you can run for longer because you can 
set those parameters there, and there is some evidence that suggests that 
people will have an increased aerobic fitness just through intense 
visualizations. 
 
 
The operative word there is intense. Hopefully you’ve all begun to experience 
your mentalizations getting increasingly intense over the period of the last 
few days. Would that be fair to say? 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Of course that process will continue as you continue practicing. So, I 
appreciate that. Thank you very much. All right, let’s carry on with where we 
left off. 
 
The Choice 
 
Igor: 
We’ve kind of been setting the conditions up more and more for the learning 
process. Most of you have been reporting interesting breakthroughs, 
interesting insights, interesting changes occurring as a result of that, right? 
 
 
So, let’s see if we can amp that up a little bit more. The last time you went 
inside to the practice room, you observed an expert performing a particular 
task. When you went back and did it again with some specific parameters –
look at their face, look at their breathing, look at their body, look at them 
overall – it sharpened your perceptions to some degree. 
 
 
In other words, you got more information and more quality of information 
from that experience. By the way, how many of you had your mentor 
spontaneously butt in and tell you to pay attention to things you were 
neglecting to pay attention to? Hands up. 
 
 
That’s a useful thing to have. That’s one of the reasons that the mentor is 
present as well. What I’d like you to do this time is once again return to the 
same place. If you need to, go ahead and watch the expert doing their thing 
again for a little while to get back into that flow of it. 
 
 
But the operative element is once you’ve observed them or if you just want to 
recollect what you’ve already done, I’d like for you to turn to your mentor and 
discuss what it is you’ve seen.  
 
 
Now, the discussion should take place on a couple of different levels and they 
can be done in turn.  
 
1. One is here’s the kind of things I’m noticing and see if your mentor 
wants to add anything that you may have missed to that mix. 
 
2. The second thing to do is to describe to your mentor which qualities of 
this expert you desire and, importantly, which qualities you do not.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
513 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Let’s take an example here. If your expert is very good at what it does but has 
some kind of illness, you don’t want your unconscious mind getting the idea 
that you have to be ill in order to be good at the task.  
 
 
If the expert has some kind of obnoxious character trait, you may not 
necessarily want to emulate the obnoxiousness part of the character trait, 
unless it is actually a character trait that you’re actually trying to emulate. 
 
I want you to have a frank discussion with the mentor about the qualities of 
your expert that you desire and the qualities that you do not desire, that you 
do not want.  
 
 
Of course, your mentor being a free unconscious spontaneous figure may well 
ask you about additional qualities you may not have thought about that you 
can choose to adopt or not adopt also. Does that make sense? Do you all have 
a reasonable idea of what discussion to have?  
 
Student: I just have a question about you said that you can discuss things that you 
don’t want to have, and I read somewhere when I was looking into 
affirmations and stuff like that, that the unconscious can’t process a negative. 
 
Igor: 
Versus negation? 
 
Student: Exactly and I was wondering how you should work those. 
 
Igor: 
First of all let’s speak to the actual idea of whether or not the unconscious 
process is negation. Once again it is both true and untrue simultaneously. 
Allow me to elaborate. 
 
 
 
First of all the idea was posited mostly by hypnotists and hypnotherapists. 
Whilst there’s truth in that – and we’ll talk about what the truth element of 
that is in a moment – it completely negates about 300 years of hypnotic 
history where negative suggestions were presented quite successfully. 
 
 
In other words, you will not smoke, and they stopped smoking. You will not 
feel this way, and he doesn’t feel that way anymore at all. Clearly it is a flawed 
statement or a flawed idea if you treat it as an absolute. 
 
 
So, where did that idea come from? Here’s the classic example. Whatever you 
do, don’t think of a little red monkey climbing a little red tree eating a little 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
514 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
red apple and throwing a little red ball at a little red cat. Whatever you do, 
don’t think about that. 
 
 
Of course in order to be able to understand the statement, it’s a linguistic 
trick. You have to make a mental movie of that scene in order to be able to 
delete that.  
 
 
Another classic example is whatever you do for the next few moments; do not 
think of a spoon. It’s a paradox because where attention goes energy flows, 
but as all of us have noticed our unconscious mind is a bit smarter than that 
because you couldn’t even understand a negation if there weren’t a 
mechanism inside you to understand it. 
 
 
In other words, the way language the conclusion of language is presented to 
consciousness. What will first happen is there will be sound waves. That will 
be translated to electrical signals, chemical signals, etc., those things that 
enter the brain and get sorted and filtered into what deals with sound. 
 
 
Eventually the sound parts which are part of the human speech range will 
enter different areas of your brain, like the Wernicke’s area and Broca’s 
region I think are two of the classic ones that process language so you can 
understand and speak it. 
 
 
Then that gets created into some kind of thought image and finally you will 
consciously have a realization of what was said. Luckily that whole process 
takes a very, very short amount of time so that you feel like you understand 
the meaning in real time and you’re not actually experiencing the tiny lag that 
is required for you to understand me. 
 
 
Included in that translation process is a negation. If you add a negation in 
classical hypnosis, the risk that you’re running is what’s called passing, that 
the unconscious mind only pays attention to a portion of your communication 
and you can use it to your advantage. Try this with kids. Whatever you do, 
don’t smile. As opposed to whatever you do don’t smile. Do you notice I’m 
adding meaning to the communication that is beyond just the words I’m 
using? 
 
 
The reason this is important in intercommunication, like when you’re talking 
to other people, it’s because the errors can occur in the translation process, 
so either the sound wave gets somehow blocked because there’s a siren and 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
515 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
they don’t catch a word, or the signal doesn’t quite come through fully or it’s 
not processed entirely, so the gist of the sentence is converted and the 
negation may have been lost and so problems can ensue. 
 
 
But that’s when you’re talking to someone else. When you’re talking to 
yourself everybody already knows what you’re talking about because it’s still 
part of you. So, that is not as much of a problem. If we’ve got the idea of 
intentionality out of the way – in other words when people have a weak 
intent, they often fail not because the suggestion was poorly phrased. It’s just 
their unconscious isn’t taking them seriously. 
 
 
So, the simplest way to have a discussion is the way you have a discussion 
with a real mentor – I don’t like this, I don’t want to have that part of my life 
and so on, this is what I want and this is what could be good, etc. 
 
 
Provided you do that with the right kind of intent, you’ll be good to go, and 
once again the equanimity will help. If you’re afraid of the trait, if you spurn 
the trait for example, if you have negative attachments shall we say, that 
attachment might let that idea loop so efficiently to acquire enough mental 
energy and enough attention for it to actualize as a ideomotor response or an 
ideodynamic response, etc. 
 
 
Provided your intent is clean, which it will be because you spent three days 
cleaning that sort of stuff up, I honestly wouldn’t concern myself about that 
portion.  
 
 
If you have very harsh language, if you have a very harsh way of talking to 
others or to yourself and negation is part of that, then generally cleaning up 
your language might be useful anyways as an exercise for yourself, but 
beyond that try it for yourself and then the proof of this pudding will be in 
your eating it.  
 
Student: For the next exercise that we’re doing, I’ve already gone ahead in my 
conscious mind and I have a good idea… 
 
Igor: 
Of what you want. 
 
Student: … of us and I will like and what I won’t like in the conversation with the 
mentor.

Igor: 
Perfect. 
 
Student: I’m wondering does that violate the first rule of Flight Club. Am I creating 
rather than discovering? 
 
Igor: 
The potential is there, I would agree, and find out. How will you know if you’ll 
be surprised until it’s happened? Do you see what I mean? Do the exercise 
first and afterwards if it became a problem, then we can discuss that. I 
suspect you may be pleasantly surprised.  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Arthur: 
I need a little help with practice room three because I don’t see how I can – I 
mean if I was watching a video of an expert, then I could concentrate on their 
appearance and face and breathing but just calling in an expert, I have no idea 
really what their mannerisms are. 
 
Igor: 
You wouldn’t know what mannerisms to observe if you had to consciously 
construct them – in other words if you were over-controlling it in a classical 
visualization sense. What I’m asking you to do here is call in an expert and 
allow them to do their thing spontaneously. 
 
 
It’s exactly the same question we had earlier about how do you allow a scene 
to arise from nothing? How do you have an interaction with an unknown 
entity? How did you know to let your skin cells talk to you in that way? You 
didn’t. You didn’t rehearse it. It was a surprise. So, if you find yourself treating 
the expert as a little marionette puppet that you’re pulling the strings on and 
saying now you’ll do this and now you’ll do that, you’ve missed the point.  
 
 
The point is that you’re observing what’s occurring spontaneously as opposed 
to what you think should be occurring consciously. 
 
Arthur: 
I see. So, this is then different from for example when Tony Robbins would 
model someone. 
 
Igor: 
The classic NLP modeling process is back to front. I’ll explain more about that 
when we finish the next couple of exercises if you wish, but they start with 
the conscious mind and it’s way too conscious.

If you actually look at where the modeling process idea came from – which is 
his instructors, Grinder and Bandler – and you look at how they did their 
modeling processes with Milton Erickson, it was absolutely nothing like the 
classic NLP modeling process. It was a deep trance edification and we’ll 
discuss more what that means in due course. 
 
Arthur: 
So, in this particular case, you call in your expert and… 
 
Igor: 
Let them do their thing. 
 
Arthur: 
And they perform and however you imagine they might be behaving, you’ll 
examine that even though that may or may not be how they really behave. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. It has no bearing on physical reality at this point, no bearing at all. 
The key piece is are you trying to control the visualization or is it just doing its 
thing and you’re observing it? That’s the key distinction. 
 
 
In due course what will happen is very much again like Simon’s experience of 
his hostel. If you get the idea wrong the first time round, the next time you 
have an opportunity to watch the actual person, the actual expert in action, it 
will correct itself automatically. 
 
 
This is just another way of letting the unconscious knowledge emerge. If 
you’ve never seen the person in action, well then your unconscious will be 
guesstimating, extrapolating from experiences how they would do it. It may or 
may not be accurate but that’s irrelevant as long as your skill improves. 
 
 
For example, you could be in a position where you think you’re emulating an 
expert, but you’re actually doing something they never even considered, at 
the end of which you can do something they cannot. Does it matter? Hell no. 
You still improved. Did that help? 
 
Arthur: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.  
 
Student: The skill I want to get better at is scuba diving, and from the experts that I 
know one is very good at orientating himself under water and the other one is 
very good at diving into greater depths, which are really different skills. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Student: So, do I call in the first expert… 
 
Igor: 
This is an excellent point. The question is which skill do you actually want? If 
you try to eat the whole elephant in one go, you’re going to get indigestion. 
You want to specify I only want this skill and this is the best person to observe 
for that. 
 
 
So, in scuba diving you can probably break it down into dozens of sub-skills, 
subsets, and then just focus on those particular subsets. If you try to do the 
entire skill in one go, then it will make it much harder for you to learn 
something. 
 
 
I’ll give you a quick example. This will be on the audio mp3 that you’ll get to 
download after the course. One of the skills was one of the students plays the 
guitar. He’s self taught but he can’t play the guitar and sing at the same time. 
If he tries to play the guitar and sing at the same time, it just falls apart.  
 
 
He can play the guitar or he can just sing along, but he couldn’t do both. 
That’s a very concrete, very defined skill. Does it improve his fingering? No. Is 
he improving his voice inflections? No.  
 
 
All that he’s doing is making the breakthrough that allows him to both play 
and sing simultaneously. It’s a very nicely defined portion of that skill and so 
when he had his breakthrough of course it was very easy for him to first of all 
notice it, and secondly to actually achieve it in the first place. Thank you, 
excellent question. 
 
 
All right, unless there are other questions, do you all understand the nature of 
the next exercise? Really you’re going to build off the observations you’ve 
made so far. You can remind yourself of them if you want quickly, but don’t 
spend too much time on that, and discuss with your mentor – I’d like these 
things, I don’t like these things.  
 
 
The more specific you can be the better. Do you all understand the nature of 
the task? It’s very simple. It should be relatively quick, as quick as it would be 
to have a normal conversation. Off you go.

Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’m back in my training room. It’s quite a small room. Everything is painted 
red. I’m all dressed in black and I’ve become myself. I’m trying to better my 
finger-picking skills on guitar. My mentor who’s taken the shape of my dad 
when he was in his 30’s has entered the room.  
 
 
In the last session he told me I forgot to have fun while doing that, while 
picking the guitar. So, I guess I’m – I guess from that answer that he gave me, I 
could ask him what I need and what I don’t need to have more fun while 
doing this.  
 
 
So, he’s telling me to play from my unconscious mind, to put myself in a state 
when I am from time to time doing other things in the same state that I am 
while working with images on my computer or while designing things. So, I 
wonder what quality I don’t need to succeed with the guitar. 
 
 
He says I focus way too much on technique. I don’t need that. I really don’t 
need to be conscious and try and learn. I will learn. The answer now feels 
quite obvious. I think I’m satisfied with that lesson enough and just see if 
something else surprises me. 
 
 
I’m in a different room now, the same mentor. It’s the same room but it’s 
green instead of red. Interesting. It’s a better atmosphere, a better feeling in 
this room. I guess I’m just going to try and relax in this new environment. This 
is the place for relaxation.  
 
 
My mentor tells me that maybe that’s a clue to change the physical 
environment as well as the environment of the mind. Now the walls and the 
ceiling and the floor are blue instead.  
 
 
I think I prefer it green but there’s something that I haven’t learned yet from 
this new room. He says it’s not time for that lesson now. I guess I’m just going 
to sit with that for a while.  
 
Igor: 
All right, find a point to pause the conversation and bring yourself back using 
your normal closing process, something grounding and something integrating 
at the end.

How did that go? Was is straightforward? This is the feedback bit. You only 
have to nod or shake your head. I don’t require anything more from you. Was 
that relatively straightforward? Excellent. Were there any surprises whilst 
having a discussion with your mentor about either what you observed in 
terms of behaviors or what you like and dislike about that individual? 
 
Student: It was a really interesting experience. I was talking to my teacher and said I’m 
going to have to refer you to the creator of this technique, and I had a 
conversation with him and he said just disregard that, I just put that in there 
to make it easy to teach but this is what I really do inside my head. 
 
Igor: 
Very useful. Excellent. 
 
Student: So, that was very insightful. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Good. Were there any other surprises like that? 
 
Student: Yes, besides the fact that the mentor started laughing about some weird 
things that the specialist did, the question is do we go directly into the 
practice room – because I found that I go much deeper if I go through the 
relaxation world? 
 
Igor: 
Let me speak to that a little bit. You may notice I’ve got practice room one, 
two, three and four in there. That’s because I’m breaking up a longer process 
into little increments that we can discuss so we can share common 
terminology and so on without overloading you. 
 
 
In actuality – you’ll hear this actually happening on the audios that we send – 
this is actually one process. You’ll start with a bit of rehearsal, which is 
optional to be honest with you. Then you’ll bring your mentor in for a little bit 
of discussion.  
 
 
Then you’ll bring your expert into witness or observe what they’re doing. 
You’ll pay attention to all those different things like their face, their breathing 
and so on. Then you’ll discuss with your mentor what you’ve just observed 
and what you liked and disliked about it. 
 
 
This is all one segment, and in the final step of course we’re trying to save 
time. So, the whole practice will probably take you in terms of your own 
mental experience 30 minutes or maybe 40 minutes if it’s more elaborate to 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
521 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
do, but we’re breaking it down piece by piece so that you have a clear 
understanding of what each step is about.  
 
 
So, you’re actually having to reenter the practice room several times to 
continue where you left off essentially. That’s just working with the limitation 
of having a group. That’s all. Of course you can reenter the room in any way 
you wish. It’s your room. Thank you for that. 
 
Student: For me at first I couldn’t think of any traits I actually didn’t want. I suppose it’s 
kind of a role model figure for me. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. 
 
Student: But then when I was talking with my mentor, it was like she wanted to know 
some kind of idea of the limits of kind of how much this person actually wants 
to be and what we hit on in the end was that she made a lot of sacrifices to 
become ultimately as good as she is at what she does, and I don’t really want 
it that much. We ended up getting into a whole conversation a lot deeper 
than I thought about motivation and presence. 
 
Igor: 
And once again the phrase I’m listening out for which I really liked is ‘much 
more than I was thinking of’ because it shows again the spontaneous or the 
unconscious interaction you’re having there, and I actually agree with that.  
 
 
I did this process in a separate context – not in an ASH Method context – with 
someone and their role model was Nelson Mandela and of course his big 
transition was by spending a number of years – probably decades – in prison. 
The best way to become an inspiration figure is not to have to go to jail for a 
while so you can come out transformed, right? 
 
 
That’s exactly the kind of thing we’re trying to catch. It may be small nuances. 
It may be blatantly obvious but if you don’t have that discussion in the first 
place, you won’t know. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: Thank you.

Transform 
 
Igor: 
All right, shall we take the final step in this process? This is the pay dirt. In the 
final process we’re just going to go with the skill that you’ve already been 
practicing for a couple of days now and let it transform. 
 
 
You’ll transform in exactly the same way as you did with the leaf and droplet 
or the owl yesterday. You’ll just step in or merge in or however you did it last 
time. You’ll do the same thing.  
 
 
If you think about it, all the observations you’ve done and all the discussions 
you’ve had are similar in nature to the ones you’ve had when stepping into 
the owl or the leaf and so on. Would that be fair to say? 
 
 
So, do the same thing. Some of you will step straight in. Some of you will kind 
of shimmy in. Some of you will warp in. I have no idea how you’ll do it, but the 
essence is to become the expert for a while and do the skill until you have a 
sense that you’re satisfied that you’ve gained something from it.  
 
 
Because of time constraints, please don’t spend the next hour on it. I know 
this can be fascinating but just get a sense of satisfaction that you’ve gained 
something from it.  
 
 
This is the important part. You’ve discussed with your mentor what you want 
and don’t want. When you return have a chat with your mentor again and ask 
him or her to do a body scan for you to make sure you haven’t accidentally 
brought something with you that you do not want. Do you understand? 
 
 
So, you’ll step in, you’ll have the experience and you’ll get some insight or 
learning. Once you’ve had a satisfying sense of it, come on back out, discuss it 
with the mentor and let the mentor do a body scan with you. If you’ve 
accidentally brought something with you that shouldn’t be there, either you 
or your mentor – or you can work together – can return it.  
 
 
Then bring yourself back and again importantly as a double safety check, do a 
second body scan yourself as your grounding practice to double check that 
everything is as it should be, except of course you may have a sense of 
addition from the skill that you’ve just had an experience of. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
523 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
After the body scan, do some kind of integration moment. Just sit with it. Just 
let things settle in on their own. Then open your eyes and come back. When 
enough of you have all come back, then I’ll call the rest of you back so that we 
can have a discussion about it. We’re just working with the limitations of this 
group.  
 
 
Once again, your aim is not to become the Buddha over the next four hours of 
transmutation. Your aim is to just get a satisfying experience that something 
has happened so that you can return and we can discuss that so that the 
principle is there to be used whenever you want to. Are there any questions 
on that? 
 
Student: If the skill is something that involves a lot of physical movement and taking 
into account that we’re in a room here – so that’s the question – but in 
practice would it help if when you’re doing this that you actually go through 
those motions? 
 
Igor: 
The answer is yes and you don’t have to go as extreme as you think. Let’s take 
this lady’s example from the scene earlier on. Remember, the operative 
element – and this is what all the researchers say also – is a micro-muscular 
movement. You don’t have to have the full sequence of movement to do that. 
 
 
I’ll give you an example of an earlier practice I had. This is from years ago 
when I was using a form of this for training martial arts. Believe it or not I did 
not go around destroyed my house. I didn’t even go visit other people’s 
houses to destroy those.  
 
 
All I would do is if I was visualizing a particular thing, I might turn and then in 
my mind I understand enough of what I’m doing for the full sequence. I’ve 
done little movements with it but each one does something different, and in 
my mentalization of the process I get the full sensory experience. So, you have 
a hybrid of the two. I didn’t even have to do that part. It just helped me 
stabilize it. 
 
Student: That’s what I’m talking about, those miniature movements, what you were 
just doing then. I find that when I’m doing these exercises if I pantomime if 
you will, those sorts of things help me.

Igor: 
Absolutely. That’s part of day one – the stabilizer factor. As you get better at 
this you won’t need that anymore, but if there’s a particular thing that needs 
stabilizing and you’d feel better with it, absolutely do it. Go ahead.  
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Just don’t knock out your neighbor. You can knock yourself out but not him. 
 
Student: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other questions or does that cover it? Good. So, you all 
understand the exercise. All right, I’m not going to set a time limit. I’m just 
going to wait for enough of you to come back before I call the rest of you 
back. Please don’t hang out too long on a skill. Just get enough of a sense that 
something’s going on or a satisfying sense because I have more content. Off 
you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, apparently I’m outside the room I was in. There’s a door. It has a different 
color. It’s a red brownish door. I can’t grab the handle, I can’t open the door. I 
guess I’ll sit with that for a while. 
 
 
There’s some kind of gem or diamond or something outside the room now 
and I’m still not allowed back in. Now a leprechaun suddenly appeared. I 
wonder what he has to teach me about the situation, his eyes start taking the 
shapes of hearts. He hasn’t spoken yet. He says is this really what you want? I 
guess the answer is no, and he disappeared.  
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting? Stand up if you want to make a comment about your 
experience or have a question about it. 
 
Student: I wasn’t allowed back in to the room. 
 
Igor: 
You weren’t allowed back in? 
 
Student: No.  
 
Igor: 
Did you ask why? 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
525 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: Yes, apparently this is a waste of time. This is not what you should do. That’s 
why you haven’t done it, the task. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, the skill is irrelevant to you, so you’d just be wasting your time? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fair enough.  
 
Student: Yes, but it left me with more focus, I guess. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. The important thing to realize here is you still have choice. In other 
words, as the conscious mind you still get to insist if something’s important to 
you but again it’s forcing of the unconscious. You still have to go into some 
kind of agreement or something like that. In other words, you can say look 
this part of it is important to me, and it might end up saying well it’s a lot 
easier to get in this way. That might be one version of it. It seems like it 
actually just helped you become more clear or focused on something. 
 
Student: Definitely, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. As long as it’s valuable and it enhances your life – the reason I’m 
saying this is because what we don’t want is where your unconscious says no 
you’re not allowed in. You don’t take everything at face value.  
 
 
It’s much like the person I told you about whose family member turned up 
and wanted him to fail. That’s not the end of the story. That’s the beginning of 
the negotiation, and when you have a successful resolution that works for 
everyone concerned, then you have actually which is much better than the 
conditions were beforehand.  
 
 
It’s important that you understand this is all about improving your life, not 
limiting it further.  
 
Student: Yes, my realization was that that room was reserved for things I really want. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fair enough. 
 
Student: So, we agreed that you don’t want this enough. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
526 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. Just dive into the really big stuff. Why not? In your case, it was 
fantastic. I’m making a more general comment so that people don’t get the 
wrong idea.  
 
 
Sometimes in the whole self-improvement field we get this idea that your 
inner guides or your unconscious mind or whatever people want to call this – 
that you’re to do exactly what they say, whenever they say. Just remember 
it’s always this relationship and the relation is built on trust, which goes both 
ways. 
 
 
So, if there’s a voice inside your mind telling you to do very bad things to 
people, you don’t have to do that. You realize this, right? It’s very important 
to emphasize that fact. That’s just an externalization of what the problem. It’s 
a manifestation of the very problem they’ve come to see. So, once you find 
that voice, that’s when the healing starts taking place, not because you do 
what it says, but because now you have something to resolve.  
 
 
In the same way as with the student I mentioned with the family member, he 
was shocked when essentially his own unconscious was saying to him good, 
go ahead and fail. 
 
 
But it’s not his whole unconscious. That’s just the part of his unconscious that 
represents the actual problem that he’s facing – the block he’s in front of. In 
resolving that part of his relationship with himself, probably the family 
member and him will have a better understanding anyways, but in terms of 
the thing he was dealing with, the results just showed the other proof to 
himself. 
 
 
He suddenly had more energy, he was more dynamic and within days of that 
session his whole career went from sitting on the couch and not being able to 
get away from the TV to doing some pretty awesome things. Thank you for 
that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: When we did the exercise previously, the whole thing was a big surprise. I 
went to do the like – what I didn’t want – so, I didn’t want to be a chain 
smoker. I didn’t want to drink excessive coffee. I didn’t want to be reed thin. I 
didn’t want to be in politics. But then, I shifted into the woman’s body and my 
hands went inside her hands but I was typing on a Mac instead of writing. She 
was writing on a Tablet, but it was my brain writing through her. 
 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
527 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So, when we did this new one, then I went back and did the same thing but I 
realized I didn’t want what she was writing, for example. What I wanted was 
her capacity to concentrate and so that shifted, which was very exciting and 
then I gave her a gold pen and she gave me a MacBook Pro. It was great. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. I appreciate that. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Are there any other comments? 
 
Student: I found out that this exercise would be very practical for any important 
meeting or anything because can we imagine how much better the result 
would be after this exercise, and I have had experience already to have power 
states that were similar exercises, and what I learned from that it’s helped a 
lot. 
  
 
Sometimes you need a long time – one hour – to do this exercise and then it’s 
working perfectly actually because you could already see influence or 
mistakes or even not mistakes but the way to prepare that way like you want 
it. 
 
 
But what was also helpful, sometimes the situation when you don’t know 
where to turn, whether right or left, small moments when you’re not 
confident in something, just close your eyes for a half a minute, just a little bit 
to play that way, and it is immediately stabilized. That’s what I can say. 
 
Igor: 
Again, tomorrow when we talk more about how to practice in general – 
because we’re doing a longer process there. Have you noticed this? There will 
be a place for longer processes and shorter processes. This stuff has to fit into 
your normal life. You can’t expect yourself to go hide in a cave for a month to 
do it and then go meet life and say look I am transformed, I’ve come back to 
you. 
 
 
Very few people in modern life have the luxury to do something like that. So, 
if this tool doesn’t it into your everyday life, then it’s really not a useful tool 
for you. Is there a question? 
 
Student: Thank you for that exercise. This year I started studying ballroom dancing. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
528 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Yes, that’s a wonderful skill. 
 
Student: And my teacher’s a black pole champion, so she’s incredible. I’m really 
appreciative that you created that what is it that she has that I don’t want. So, 
it was incredible to be inside her and feel that power and elegance doing the 
movement, and then when I separated I thought okay do a body scan. I felt 
what are we looking for?  
 
 
So I was little confused and since there are definite things I don’t want, it was 
like things were flying out of me and when I came  back out I was like I was 
like… so what am I looking for? How do I sense any body scan to look for? 
 
Igor: 
The simple answer you won’t know until you do the scan. Remember 
yesterday we had a gentleman who became the owl and when he came back 
his finger was left with a feather. In his case it was a resource. He actually 
wanted it, which is fine, but what if he didn’t want it? What if it was like this is 
kind of odd because now my finger is stuck and all I can do is wave it round? 
 
 
I’m exaggerating. First of all the mentor does the body scan first is because 
your unconscious mind will kind of spot things like do you want this? No. Do 
you want this? No. You seem to have had a similar experience where when 
you returned things were flying out of you. You’re not exactly sure what they 
were but they were leaving anyways.  
 
 
In other words, whatever unpleasant influences you might have brought with 
you that’s your first layer of screening, shall we say. When you do your body 
scan again all you’re sensing is, is something out of place? Is there something 
there I don’t want for myself? 
 
 
If you have a sense like maybe your feet feel lighter or smoother in some 
ways, do you want that? I would imagine so for ballroom dancing. If on the 
other hand you have a sense of like your chest is feeling more female, you 
might decide you like it – I don’t know – but if you went for the decision that 
you didn’t like it, once again that would be a time when you can say oh, I’ve 
accidentally brought symbolic extra with me that I don’t necessarily want at 
the point and then you can return that again. 
 
 
The whole is not to know what you’re looking for ahead of time. You’re 
looking for only what seems out of place, what would I not be happy to carry 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
529 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
back into my real life? That’s the thing that you’re looking for and you will 
never know what that is until you do the scan. 
 
 
I expect for most people for it to be a clear scan, which is fine. It’s a safety 
check and we’ve got two versions of it – the unconscious check and the 
conscious check, but from time to time stuff does come along and you may as 
well notice it and then put it back where it belongs rather than living it out in 
your own life. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Thank you. Are there any other comments or questions on what you’ve 
done? Was this a useful process for you guys? Did you enjoy that? Now 
because of the size of the group I couldn’t set it up the way I usually like to do 
this, but you will hear this setup on the audio MP3’s that you’ll be 
downloading  
 
 
I specifically asked them for a testable skill. So, one of the examples you’ll 
have is a guy who wants to play the guitar and sing at the same time, and he 
actually shows you how he fails to start with just because I asked him to play 
with to so we could see what it is, and after about an hour or so or 15 minutes 
or so of doing this – again broken up in these pieces – at the end of it he does 
it again and he does a perfect job of it. It’s actually quite interesting. It’s 
actually quite pleasant to listen to. 
 
 
The other one wanted to do something with beat boxing, which is kind of that 
bit where people use their mouth to simulate drums and all kinds of stuff like 
that. Two things happened there.  
 
 
One is he had a problem with keeping his temper, so that was pretty much 
fixed by the end of it. The second thing he said was that his mouth started 
making shapes he hadn’t even learned before, so sounds were coming out 
that he wanted to be able to do but had no concept of how to make before. 
Again, you’ll hear that on the audiotapes. 
 
 
Did anyone have similar experiences? In other words, did stuff happen inside 
that was surprising but you now have a sense that that skill has improved? A 
few of you? Excellent.

The only way you’ll know is to test it and that’s the important part. This is 
what becomes fantasy if nothing of value happens as a result of it. So, I 
encourage to try this again at home when you have more time to actually do 
it at your own rate and pace.  
 
 
Pick a small skill. Remember, you start with increments. Start with something 
small that you can get confident in than bigger things. Pick a small skill that 
you know you don’t quite have. You may be close to it or you may be far from 
it, but it’s something that’s reasonable and you would like. 
 
 
Then try it out so that you can prove to yourself that you can’t do it – at least 
not consciously. Go through this whole process again but this time take your 
time, rather than using the artificial seminar time, which has been restricted 
artificially. 
 
 
At the end of the process, do the skill again and compare. If there’s 
improvement, then it’s been worthwhile. Does that make sense? Are there 
any questions on this process? 
 
Student: How would you switch it to make it an average skill, like for example learning 
or focus or those things? 
 
Igor: 
I would never do it with a theoretical skill. Learning is not a skill. Learning 
math is a better skill. Learning a specific language or a set of vocabularies is a 
skill. Learning a particular accent is a skill. It’s concrete.  
 
 
I would never do it with any abstract concepts because learning does not 
exist. What exists is the acquisition of a particular skill, which is to practice it. 
What happens over time if you do this a lot it will automate. It will habituate. 
 
 
I’ll give you an example if I may. Again, I’ve done a lot of experiments – some 
good and some bad. Again martial arts when I was younger was a big thing for 
me. So, I would in the studio and I’d watch my instructor doing something. 
He’d be going through whatever maneuver he was trying to teach us, and I’d 
look at it and I’d look at it and I’d of course be going into an altered state. 
 
 
 
At some point it repeated and suddenly I had this flash. I just could just see it. 
I could just see exactly what needed to happen. Provided I went straight into 
doing it at that point without thinking too much about it, I could get it pretty

much exactly the same way he did. Everyone else was going what the hell is 
he doing? How is he doing that? 
 
 
It was not really as stable as this work that’s going on here, but the fact is 
because of that I could just look and eventually it would just trigger in and the 
more I did it, it became a casual thing like oh yeah I’ve got it, let’s do it. 
 
 
It’s a skill that automated over time as well. So, the more you do it, like 
anything else, the better you will become at it. That’s how you create the 
abstract version of the skill, abstractly learning something, because you have 
lots and lots of examples of how that works.  
 
Student: The second example that you said that we’re taking home with us, I think is 
on a CD or something. You mentioned a guy being able to make sounds that 
he didn’t know that he could do before. I’ve tried to learn Greek and it sounds 
like Greek to me, and there are sounds in that language that are impossible 
for me – or they seem like they’re impossible for me to do. Will this 
potentially help me to do that? 
 
Igor: 
It should do. Here’s the first problem with learning a language. What people 
don’t realize is it’s not the vocabulary that’s the problem. First of all the way 
that language is taught anyways is completely back to front.  
 
 
Secondly, the problem isn’t the vocabulary as such. It’s actually even 
recognizing the sounds because your language – English – doesn’t make 
certain sounds. They’re called phonemes, like the basic sounds in language 
called phonemes. So, certain languages have different types of phonemes 
than others. 
 
 
I’ll give you a quick example of what I mean. Japanese and Spanish both have 
very, very few phonemes in their language. There are very few sounds 
compared to other languages like English.  
 
 
When a Japanese or a Spanish person tries to learn another language like 
English, it sounds terrible, not because they’re incompetent but because their 
brain cannot hear the sounds that you’re making and therefore distinguish 
between them. 
 
 
So, it all sounds the same to them. Remember the signal-to-noise ratio? To 
them what is a signal to you, what you’re listening out for – maybe the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
532 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
difference between a T and a D – does not exist for them, so they can say bad 
or bat or pat and all the different variations, but it all sounds identical to them 
because the distinctions that you’re making sounds like noise to them, and 
they’re automatically ignoring it. 
 
 
It’s not that they’re incapable of hearing it but they automatically ignore it. 
What this should do is attune you to actually hearing the sound that your 
brain normally ignores.  
 
 
Once you can hear it, it becomes easier to start emulating it. Your mirror 
neurons now have something to engage in until ultimately the vocabulary 
should help. The accents should start coming out. 
 
 
Let me give you a crude example. I haven’t done this recently with this 
method, but I used to do this when I was younger with a related method. I 
was learning French in school and again I started young with all this weird 
stuff, so I experimented with things. 
 
 
This was back in the 1980’s. Do you remember that movie Cyrano de Bergerac 
with Depardieu? I watched that movie and I loved it. I could watch it for 
hours. So, what I started doing is a version of this where I kind of put myself 
into the movie and started talking in kind of a grandiose style and so on and 
my accent improved.  
 
 
Now that was a much cruder version of what you’re doing here but it does the 
same sort of thing. So, in theory absolutely, unless there’s something else 
going on you should improve both your accent and your vocabulary and all 
kinds of other things because you now start paying attention to information 
that used to be automatically rejected before. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes, thank you. 
 
Igor: 
But then don’t believe me. Do it yourself and then your own experience 
should be the proof of that. 
 
Student: Understood.  
 
Igor: 
Are there any other comments or questions on that? Who enjoyed the 
exercise? Hands up. Excellent. All right, so let’s park that one for a moment 
and let’s just spend a few moments just warming up for the next round.

Inner Healing 
 
Igor: 
We spent some time today figuring out how to acquire skills, which is, this is 
really the culmination of that process. 
 
 
You don’t always need the entire process. Some skills are just very quick. You 
just go to the practice room and you’re done. With others you may want to 
spend more time on, but now let’s look at something else which is of great 
value to us in life, which is how do we overcome personal problems?  
 
 
How do we heal either emotionally or physically or psychologically? Because 
we’re coming to this territory which is headed by this heal or healing, I have 
to offer you my medical disclaimer. I make no medical claims. Folks, please 
don’t arrest me. 
 
 
But what I can do is present to you information that is well researched. For 
example, in terms of the healing response, whilst doctors can do a lot about 
stimulating the healing process, the body is the one that does the healing. All 
that the drugs are doing is assisting that process like a crutch until it can take 
over on its own, or just stimulate it to get started in the first place. 
 
 
Many conditions go into spontaneous remission. What does spontaneous 
remission mean? Basically the problem’s gone away and the doctor has no 
idea how that happened.  
 
 
 
Now for both factual reasons and other reasons, I can’t say to you that you’ll 
be able to heal any problem, any condition like that, although I am working on 
a way of expanding this for the healing process in general. The general rule is 
your unconscious mind is doing it.  
 
 
Let’s take the field of hypnosis for a moment. People under hypnosis can have 
their bleeding induced – in other words they can start bleeding without even 
a cut.  
 
 
The extreme version of that is called stigmata. Under surgery you can present 
people with suggestions to minimize their bleeding or even prevent bleeding, 
and it does.  
 
 
You can also present suggestions for increased healing response afterwards, 
and typically people who have been prepared properly for surgery will spend

typically I think it’s like half or a third the amount of time in the recovery ward 
than the average person would do. 
 
 
So, there is clearly impact, only we can guarantee the impact and we don’t 
know what the level of the impact will be. The same goes for emotional or 
psychological healing.  
 
 
How many of you have resolved some kind of issue – maybe you were afraid 
of something and you’re no longer afraid of it – but you have no idea when or 
how it happened? Psychologists might call that a spontaneous remission of a 
psychological problem. 
 
 
The fact is your mind knows how to resolve things. If you are doing something 
to maintain the problem of course that’s another thing. Hence, the 
equanimity practice is so important so that at the very least you’re slowly 
eroding how the problem is maintained rather than increasing it. 
 
 
But what can we do to maybe help that process along? Wouldn’t that be of 
interest? How many people here would say they’ve already had just 
spontaneously, in terms of what we’ve been doing here, moments over the 
last few days where they’ve really let go of something that was troubling 
them – an emotion, a thought, an idea or something like that? That was just 
spontaneous without even seeking it, right? 
 
 
So, how can we start targeting this on purpose, would that be of interest to 
you? Let’s start this off again in typical fashion, which is with a bunch of 
exercises to start building a skill set and developing a bit of trust internally. 
Again, this is all in the framework, which is to say especially if it comes to 
physical healing, I can make no guarantees and I don’t think our science is at a 
point where we can make any guarantees about anything in that sense. 
 
 
What we can do is we can increase the likelihood of it happening. I’ll give you 
a very quick example of this if I may. In the field of hypnosis, like in any other 
field, you have a very wide variety of skill sets.  
 
 
You have some very bad people, you have some very good people and you 
have some people in the middle who are just competent, some barely so and 
some more so. This is important for what I’m about to demonstrate.

When you have a terminal illness – for example cancer – because medical 
science itself can’t guarantee results and has such a devastating consequence, 
it’s one of the few fields where something like hypnosis has been allowed into 
the research with classical medical science to assist that process. 
 
 
There’s an interesting meta study. A meta is basically where they pull out all 
the other studies done on a particular topic and collate them and use some 
magical juju mathematics to determine how it would have gone if all of them 
happened at the same time. It’s not as good as having a large scale study on a 
specific point but it’s indicative. 
 
 
This includes lots of little studies in hypnosis used with terminal patients with 
a wide variety of skills. Some of those therapists would have been great 
hypnotherapists, some of those therapists would have been competent and 
some would have been just inept but did their best anyways. 
 
 
In this meta study, they found that when people were using a hypnotic 
process like guided visualization – that was the main version – and remember 
it’s not the visualization you’re doing here. These were someone else 
choosing the symbols for you or even if the person chose it themselves they 
were choosing it more consciously.  
 
 
The patients lived on average 50% longer than those that just received just 
the regular treatment. Let me emphasize that those going through the guided 
visualization process or the hypnotic process and so on also received regular 
Western medical interventions – hypnotherapy and stuff like that.  
 
 
This is not to say you don’t need medicine. Not in the least. These are working 
together hand in hand. That’s quite a significant thing, isn’t it? What we want 
to do is get in touch with the body’s natural ability to do that. 
 
 
Whether it’s for an emotional wound or for a physical wound, we want to be 
able to create the conditions that will optimize or make it easiest for a 
recovery to take place. Do you understand the point I’m trying to make here? 
 
 
What I’m trying to avoid giving you is a sense of false hope that this will 
always work every single time exactly like it says on the tin because it’s a 
claim that no one can make and it would be giving you an unfair expectation.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

Having an expectation is good but having a distorted expectation is not 
helpful. Do you understand the caveat I’m presenting? With that thought in 
mind, let’s start seeing if we can develop a sense of personal healing. Would 
that be of value to you? 
 
 
First we’ll just do a couple of quick exercises to warm you up. Then we’ll have 
a break so that you can kind of decompress a little bit. Then we’ll come back 
and we’ll start building that progressively to something that you can use more 
systematically. 
 
Pleasant Landscapes 
 
Igor: 
The first exercise is very simple. Go back into your mentalizations and all I 
want you to do is ask your unconscious mind to take you to three or four 
pleasant landscapes, pleasant scenes, pleasant environments.  
 
 
Hang out a little bit in each one and see if you can get a bit of a pleasant glow 
from it. Then move to the next one and the next one and the next one, and 
then come back. 
 
 
Two or three or four is fine. It’s basically nothing more than you’ve already 
done before but this is just the warm-up act. Do not spend too long with it, 
just enough to get a bit of an afterglow of that, and then we’ll come back and 
we’ll add to that. Off you go. 
 
 
All right, whenever you’re ready just close things up and come on back. I 
presume that was of no particular difficulty for most of you. This is really old 
hat at this point just to orient you, and you all could move to pleasant places 
relatively easy. 
 
Relaxation & Sanctuary 
 
 
Igor: 
This is a skill you’ve already practiced but we’re going to hone it in a particular 
direction. I’m going to ask you to do the whole thing again, only this time I’d 
like the first place you ask for to be a place of relaxation, somewhere where 
you can just mentally and physically relax, and I’d like you to rest there for a 
moment until you begin to feel that mental and physical relaxation beginning 
to occur.

If for whatever reason you can’t quite get the kinesthetically emotional 
aspects of that at this point, that’s okay. It’s training wheels. Just move on 
after a little while to the next one and you’ll have lots of time when you go 
home to go back and clean it up and start all over again. 
 
 
I’m just looking for a minute or so to get there and a minute or so to 
appreciate it. Then when you’ve had a sense of relaxation, ask your 
unconscious again to teleport you and take you somewhere else. This will be a 
place of sanctuary – in other words a place that’s safe both emotionally and 
physically.  
 
 
It may be similar to the relaxation place. It may be the same. It may be 
different. I do not know and honestly I don’t care. Do you understand the 
nature of the exercise I’m asking you to do?  
 
 
We’re looking for relaxation and we’re looking for sanctuary. Get to know the 
place relatively well. Get a feeling of that safety and relaxation and so on. 
Then we’ll come back and have a brief discussion of that, and then after the 
break we’ll start pulling the stops out. Sound good?  
 
 
If you haven’t done so yet, make sure you move to a place of sanctuary now. 
All right, start making your closing processes and then come on back. How 
was that? Was that interesting and enjoyable?  
 
 
We’re going to discuss that after the break, but before you go on a break I 
have a task for you to do during the break, and the task is this. You have a 
place you found relaxing.  
 
 
Hands up if you found a nice relaxing place you could relax in. Beautiful. 
Excellent. And you found a place that was safe – a sanctuary where you know 
you’d be safe from difficult things. Hands up if you found that. Wonderful. 
 
 
What I would like for you to do during the break are two things. I would like 
for you to find a name, a convenient label for each place. A place for 
relaxation and sanctuary – that’s not enough. That’s generic.  
 
 
I want something that specifically identifies that place for you. For example it 
might be the relaxation place with the red pine tree, so that when you read 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
538 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that name again or discuss that name again, you know exactly which space 
you’re talking about.  
 
 
So, find a name or a label for both the place of relaxation and the place of 
sanctuary. Then I’d like you to just in terms of normal casual conversations on 
the break tell others the name of it.  
 
 
When they ask you either the name they get to choose, just give them a few 
quick details – oh yeah this is the place that has this, this and this in it, just a 
few quick details just in a conversational sort of way and then you can move 
on to other conversations.  
 
 
In other words, whenever someone asks you about the place with the red 
pine trees, you’ll say oh yeah it’s got a red pine tree there, it’s got a picnic 
table there and there’s a scout tent over here, right? That’s where I just went, 
I don’t know why, but now that’s the place with the red pine tree. 
 
 
Do you get the nature of the exercise? Anyone can challenge you at any time 
to describe the place and it should stay pretty much stable. That’s your break 
exercise. Let’s be back in 10 minutes. Off you go.

DVD 16 – The Inner Healer Progression 
(Physical or Emotional) And Relaxation & 
Sanctuary 
 
 
 
Igor: 
Allow me to ask you a question. In terms of the experience you had just 
before the break – those little warm-ups, the pleasant places, sanctuary 
places and so on – if you were to describe them overall in terms of the effect 
they had on you, would they be overall toxic or tonic? 
 
 
Of course it’s not necessarily yet as extensive or extreme as it could be but it’s 
heading in the right direction, right? Now let me ask you another question. 
How many of you have now developed a reliable name for your places – 
relaxation, sanctuary and so on? 
 
 
When someone mentions those names, especially if you weren’t really 
particularly thinking about it, does it bring the place back to mind again? Do 
you find it relatively easy to describe the essential features of this particular 
place – the relaxation or sanctuary? 
 
 
Why did I throw that little bit in there? It’s because just as describing things it 
stabilizes things like we did on the first day, by naming things we make them 
more real. We start identifying that as a separate entity from everything else. 
 
 
The classic example is the Eskimos have 40 different names for the color of 
snow. You and I might make two or three distinctions and we don’t see the 
rest, but because they spend so much time around it and it’s important for 
them to understand different types of snow and the qualities it has and so on, 
they made a vocabulary of it and as a result when they speak to each other 
about snow-like conditions, they can be much more precise. 
 
 
By naming a thing, you separate it from everything else so then you decide 
this is a new signal and the rest can be noise. It’s useful to us because by 
naming out mental landscapes, our places in the mind, we can come back to 
them again.

You write the name down and of course you’ll have to link the name to the 
landscape by repetitive use over just a short period of time, and eventually it 
just becomes as simple as me asking you what did your house look like where 
you grew up? It’s there because it’s a natural part. It’s separated from all the 
other houses. 
 
 
This will be interesting especially if you want to do a type of healing that 
requires several sessions and you want to come back to the same place you 
enjoyed. You can build up more of an atmosphere in the same place that gets 
more and more evocative the more and more you succeed with it. 
 
 
Does it mean you can only use the same place to relax for the rest of your 
life? Of course it doesn’t. The mind’s capacity to be creative is immense. I 
expect over the period of your lifetime, you may discover dozens of relaxing 
places, dozens of safe places and so on that you’d like to visit just for the heck 
of it. 
 
 
Much like our psychotic friend that we talked about who had the kingdom 
under the sea, by naming it the kingdom under the sea she knew where she 
was going and it was easier to recreate it again. 
 
 
Why am I saying all this? It’s because the next step transitions from a 
generally positive to more specifically positive places.  
 
Place Of Healing 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like you to do now is again very briefly take a relatively quick 
journey. I’d like you to go inside again and this time in terms of your intention, 
ask for a place of healing, a place where you can heal. 
 
 
When you turn up there, explore it. If there are people there, interact with 
them. If there isn’t, relax and absorb the atmosphere just like you absorbed 
the atmosphere of relaxation and just like you absorbed the general positive 
emotional atmosphere of the exercise we did before.  
 
 
 
So, you’ll turn up at a place of healing and if there’s something to interact 
with, do it and if there isn’t, just hang out in there and just notice what 
happens. Then we’ll come back and discuss it and add a little bit more.

Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m back in my arctic landscape. From there I’m going to find my healing place. 
I’m in a photograph I took a few years back. It’s a mountaintop, all 
surrounded by clouds but I’m still just looking at the picture. I wonder what 
happens if I go inside. I guess I should ask for my place of healing one more 
time.  
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting? Who enjoyed their journey to a healing spa of some 
sort? What happened? What kind of things did you experience? Particularly 
the surprising stuff is of interest to me. Nothing surprises you anymore? Go 
ahead. 
 
Student: My unconscious took me straight back to the place that I chose for relaxation. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Not surprising. Did anyone else have that happen? 
 
Student: Without any doubt at all. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful, right?  
 
Student: I think so. 
 
Igor: 
I agree. I think we’re in agreement, or do you want to fight about that? Did 
anyone else have that where one of your places of relaxation and sanctuary 
ended up becoming your healing place at the same time? One of the reasons 
we do this is to see how links come up.  
 
 
Let’s call these places of power. You can create specific landscapes that you 
can evoke a quality of experience in, which can then layer on top of each 
other, so by visiting them you can have more of that quality. Do you get the 
idea? 
 
 
We start with relaxation and sanctuary because those two qualities are very 
important in the healing process. Some of you will prefer sanctuary for the 
safety element and some of you will prefer relaxation. Of course many of you 
went somewhere else instead, which is just fine. The pump has still been 
primed so to speak. Thank you for that.

Student: I went to the place of relaxation, not the place of sanctuary. Now before I 
went in, I intended that I should go to the place of relaxation because it was a 
much more peaceful and calm place, but when I went there I felt really 
uneasy. 
 
Igor: 
So, you went to the original place of relaxation and it didn’t feel right? 
 
Student: I did not feel right over there. Then I teleported to the place of sanctuary and 
when I sat over there I got a message that I should move out from here. 
 
Igor: 
A good message, yes. 
 
Student: So, then I teleported back to a place which I had not considered earlier but I 
spent a lot of time over there when I wanted to meditate or just, you know, 
and that’s the place where I felt more comfort. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Well done. I particularly like the way your unconscious very 
persistently herded you along and said that’s it, you can get there. That’s very 
nice.  
 
Student: I wanted to ask – I’m sure it’s fine, but it seemed like more of a co-creation 
between my unconscious and my conscious mind. So, what I did was I started 
thinking of the ideal future healing center.  
 
 
So, I got my unconscious to bring up experiences of healers whom I knew that 
I really truly felt were healers and put them in this center, and then conscious 
mind would be like okay now we have to have a place where they intake your 
present state, when you come in, and I thought I really like technology. Okay, 
my unconscious came up, so it was like they were kind of working together. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. As long as the unconscious mind is creating the content, all you’re 
doing is guiding the type of experience you want. I would like a healing center. 
Oh, there you go. I would like people I admire as healers to arrive.  
 
 
All you need to do is leave room for spontaneity. The more room you can 
leave for that, the more your unconscious mind has room to express itself. 
Initially even if you’re doing this sort of co-creation process, that’s fantastic 
because you’re leaving that room.

In time I suspect you’ll learn to trust the process more. You’ve only been at 
this for four days. Some of you have been doing similar stuff for some time, so 
it’s easier for you to let go and control it at the same time. For others of you 
it’s a skill that you still have to acquire. 
 
 
Eventually you’ll get to the point where you just intend. Allow me to give you 
an example of what I mean. It might be easier if I give you an example of this. 
Some months ago earlier this year I was in Paraguay, and I got bitten my leg 
by a spider.  
 
 
At first I didn’t think anything of it. It was like a little mosquito bite and I just 
ignored it, but the bite wasn’t healing and it went from a little mosquito bite 
to suddenly growing and growing. By the time it was this big I thought maybe 
I should go see a doctor about it, especially because it’s technically in the 
tropics and there are tropical diseases there, which had me a little bit worried. 
 
 
So, I find out where the tropical disease unit is and I turn up there because a 
spider bite is part of their specialty. I go to the emergency room and have to 
wait forever. This is practically a third world country, so it takes a while to go 
see a doctor. 
 
 
Eventually I see the doctor. He comes in and I show him the bite. He takes one 
look at it and says oh. So, I’m feeling really relaxed and comfortable right now. 
Then he gets his phone out and he starts taking a photograph. I swear to God 
he did.  
 
 
I thought what’s this? Is he putting me on Facebook? I don’t know. I was a 
little by this, right? Then he disappears for half an hour, so I’m sitting there 
and my mind is starting to get a little bit – you know how one little negative 
thought can start spiraling? 
 
 
I figured I better do something about this because my experience is rapidly 
deteriorating and I have enough to worry about, right? So, I did a little 
practice. I was just developing different models to see which ones would work 
the most smoothly, so I said I’ll go with this one. 
 
 
I did a little ASH Practice and I went to the initial phases where I’m stable. 
Eventually I ended up in a farm yard, which I thought what the hell does this 
have to do with my current situation?

I just remembered the farm yard. I can see there’s a long low building. It’s a 
barn but one of these modern barns like with the corrugated iron door and 
the corrugated iron roof and so on, the kind of places you’d imagine cows 
were probably kept inside but it was all locked up. 
 
 
It’s night, so I look at this barnyard thinking what the hell? But I had some 
equanimity, so I said okay I’m sure he’ll be here, so I just hung out quietly in 
this barnyard in the middle of the night with nothing going on, which of 
course kept me distracted from my leg, which I now I understand was 
probably useful. 
 
 
But then something interesting happened. Once I proved myself sufficiently 
my unconscious that I was serious about this, I got the hint to look up. I 
thought what are you looking up for? There’s just a tin roof. So, I looked at the 
tin roof and I just saw a little bit of a rosy glint like dawn coming. So, I thought 
oh that’s nice. 
 
 
The next thing I know I popped up and I’m kind of hovering above the 
barnyard and I see this tremendous vista of the dawn coming up. It was pink 
and orange. You know those kinds of vistas? It goes so far that I have like 
super panoramic vision, and I’m mesmerized by this moment. 
 
 
Then suddenly I had this huge – and I mean huge to the point of tears – 
emotion of hope welling up in me and I’m streaming tears now, at which 
point the doctor decides to come back in again. 
 
 
Of course he says no it’s okay. I was like I know it’s okay. The point is that was 
wholly unexpected. I left a very large room for spontaneity. The situation itself 
kind of called for something and I got something much better than I had 
hoped for. Let’s put it that way. 
 
 
What I’m trying to suggest to you is that what you did is absolutely perfect 
and it works fantastic, and importantly it allows you to start navigating and 
building trust.  
 
 
Over time the more you trust your unconscious, the more you trust these 
processes, the more things like that can happen to you. Does that make 
sense? Thank you for the question. It was very useful. Does that answer your 
question by the way?

Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: I just want to make a comment because I think I had the opposite of that, I 
went to three different places. They were all very distinct and they were all 
mainly specialized to one purpose. 
 
Igor: 
That’s fine. 
 
Student: My relaxation was just lounge chair on the side of a lake. Then for my safe 
place, I call it granite fortress. It’s some fortress that’s made out of a space 
age material and it has windows made of space age glass. Now I wouldn’t 
want to stay there forever, but if I was in danger I’d go there. 
 
Igor: 
Of course. 
 
Student: And my healing place was like a hospital but it was all white and everything 
was sterile. I kept thinking it’s great for healing but sort of like I go in there for 
healing and then I’m off.  
 
Igor: 
Then it’s back to life again, which is just fine again. Remember, your 
unconscious minds are all interpreting the ideas in a way that fits you, and this 
is the beauty of it. If I was doing this as a hypnotist as a guided visualization –
let’s go to my healing place everyone, this is a great time – some of you might 
agree with me and the rest of you would be going what? Why?  
 
 
The more powerful version is to create your own places of power or whatever 
you want to call them. In one case they happen to coincide – relaxation helps 
the healing process, so that’s where you like to go, but in another case you 
had to go somewhere very different, which is exactly what happened to you. 
 
 
I cannot determine ahead of time what the best way for you is. It’s the same 
kind of question again in many ways. Once you have your intention clearly 
hooked up to an unconscious response, it doesn’t matter because you can 
keep going back to the same places. 
 
 
By the way, I thank you for the question because now I’m feeling a lot of 
hope. It comes up, but you have those places ready to go for when you need

them. Now we haven’t actually done the full work yet. We’re still working up 
towards something. 
 
 
The key thing here is once again you’re taking your skills of navigation and 
you’re refining them to get specific outcomes. Whether it’s a new place or 
you’re building on a place, it doesn’t matter. You’re starting to have more 
influence over the landscape of your inner mind. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you, and thank you for sharing that because it’s important that people 
realize there’s no cookie cutter approach to this.  
 
Student: Sorry, Igor. My mind is still curious about what happened to your leg. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, the short answer is he had no idea. It could have been a number of things 
but none of them were too serious, so I got a bunch of creams and some 
antibiotics and one of them worked. I don’t know which one. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. Yes, my leg is not about to fall off, I’m quite pleased to say. 
 
Student: I closed my eyes and initially went to somewhere very dark and very strange 
and very murky, so my unconscious has done really well up to now. What I 
think at this point is that maybe I made a bit of a mistake. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Student: And then I thought I’ll stick with it for a bit and I started exploring, and I 
realized I was in my own immune system. 
 
Igor: 
Wonderful, which needed a bit of clearing up maybe, right? Wonderful. 
There’s some nice symbolism there as well. This reminds me back to the 
1960’s and 1970’s when they started experimenting with hypnotic processes 
like guided visualizations with cancer patients, and you probably all heard of 
the old Pacman metaphor because that was big in the 1970’s.  
 
 
They had the Pacman running around people’s bodies gobbling up cancer cells 
and then I stopped at that point. Now it fit the 1970’s because everyone was 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
547 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
playing Pacman, so it was a very potent symbol and it stuck with a lot of 
people because they were all addicted to the videogame.  
 
 
Would it suit us now? Maybe or maybe not. For many people, especially the 
younger generation, they have no idea what Pacman is. Again it shows the 
limitations of the traditional models but they were onto something. It just 
wasn’t as clear as hopefully you’re starting to design. 
 
 
This is a very personal practice. It’s about you. So, once again congratulations 
to your unconscious mind for being smarter than you thought you were.  
 
Student: You went to my place. I actually now believe I’m more fortunate than a lot of 
the people here because whatever it is I’m going to, it’s always the same 
color. It’s just the feeling changes. That’s all. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect. 
 
Student: So, I don’t have to visualize anything anymore. I accepted that. All I have to do 
is go with the feeling and maybe then later on my subconscious will say all 
right you’ve suffered enough and now I’ll show you now. I just wanted to 
share that. 
 
Igor: 
Really ultimately we’re told this stuff. The only proof of this concept is in your 
actual experience – do you get the results you’re looking for? If you didn’t, 
then you need to fix something because otherwise you’re embellishing on a 
fantasy. 
 
 
Whilst they can be entertaining, they don’t necessarily improve your life very 
much. I’m very adamant about this tool not becoming a fantasy tool. It’s 
actually a tool to improve things in your life.  
 
 
I for one was very happy to have had that dawn of hope at that particular 
point in time, but I did have to do a little clearing up after the doctor came in, 
but it was very useful at just the right point in time. That’s a very big convincer 
for me. 
 
 
You’ll get your own convincers by actually doing the practice and getting the 
result that says yes, this will work for me. We’ll come onto that. We’re 
working our way towards that now.

Student: My subconscious really likes gifts, so whenever I meet someone, some figure, 
I’ll buy them a beer or something. Things appeared unexpected and what I get 
in return is always so much more than I could ever expect. This time it showed 
me a process that I understood only afterwards. 
 
 
First it was – the scene doesn’t matter so much – but first it was a place of like 
I really don’t know what, you heal it, of I don’t know what. Then I fell through 
it and landed up in a place of cleansing and I thought, then after offering 
some more gifts, bribing my unconscious, then only after I was cleansed I 
went to the place of healing and of course I offered more gifts and go more in 
return, but that’s the way for me. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent and I like the fact of the process going on. In fact, what you just did 
there is an experience we’re about to have. Not this exact same one of 
course, but it’s something we’re working our way towards. So, well done for 
being ahead of the game a little bit. Were there any other comments you guys 
wanted to make? 
 
Student: I wanted to make the free sharing. One was my sanctuary. It was the same, 
the healing place as the sanctuary, but we had a fight, my unconscious and my 
conscious had a fight.  
 
 
The conscious person wanted to have something like a Buddhist Sanctuary, 
where I could put all the symbols that I have been collecting in the conscious 
mind but from religions that are very nice for me, that I like. And my 
unconscious mind kept wanting to go to the church in my town. It’s a gothic 
church that has halls and those things, and there are some owls, but small 
owls, I don’t know the name in English, that live there. And those owls and he 
wanted me to go to those owls and be there for my sanctuary. 
 
 
First of all, I have to go all the stairs up there and if I need  to heal it would be 
hard for me, so forget it. Do you want this or not? I said okay let’s go there. 
So, I got friends with the bats that live there, and with the owls and it was a 
very, very special place. 
 
Igor: 
So, are you glad you went?  
 
Student: Yes. That finally was my sanctuary.

Igor: 
There’s an old rule of thumb in the hypnosis world in general, which I think 
you just discovered, which is when the conscious mind and the unconscious 
mind are in conflict, the unconscious always wins. 
 
 
Ultimately the point of this process is the result that we get. It doesn’t 
invalidate your desire to incorporate the symbolism that you already enjoy 
into your internal landscape. Then all you do is have a chat with your 
unconscious and negotiate. You can say great we’ll go here for the healing. 
Now give me somewhere for these symbols so I can enjoy them too. 
 
 
They may just not be healing symbols or not for the kind of healing you did at 
that point in time.  
 
Student: The other thing was about this conscious participation in the things. It’s not 
from this seminar, but some time ago, my dentist didn’t want to make any 
work on me without anesthesia, because it would be as a constrictor together 
with the anesthesia and I kept asking her to do it. One day she said well today 
I don’t care if you bleed. You can go ahead, but any pain I can see in your face 
I will quit. So afterwards that day I was having a hard time concentrating and 
trying not to have any pain. It was not painful but I could still feel a little bit. 
 
Igor: 
Sensations. It was analgesic rather than anesthetic, right? 
 
Student: Yes but I was working hard and she said well, I’m so happy because this time 
you bled it was less than before. The next time I came in, she just said do you 
need time? What for? Hypnosis. So, it came immediately automatically and I 
don’t know where from. When I sat there I didn’t have to work on it, and that 
time she was doing very tough work and I didn’t feel anything. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: When it came automatically, it was magic, totally different.  
 
Igor: 
That’s the kind of magic we’re trying to work our way up towards right now, 
so I really appreciate you sharing that because that’s exactly what we’re trying 
to achieve here.  
 
Student: And the last thing is that medicine is opening the mind.

Igor: 
It’s starting to happen slowly but it’s coming, yes. I’m very happy to hear that. 
We have a couple of medical doctors in the room, so it’s your job. 
 
Student: I just came by, I was looking for some other things, but the neo cortex was the 
most scientific and more peer reviews. 
 
Igor: 
Prestigious…  
 
Student: Hard reviewers 
 
Igor: 
That’s awesome. 
 
Student: They devoted the whole issue to hypnosis, and it was very good reviews and 
so it was great. In this year. 
 
Igor: 
We’ll call that progress. Excellent. Well, long may that continue. Thank you for 
sharing that. I appreciate that. Give her a round of applause for that. All right, 
shall we take the next step? 
 
Symbolic Healing 
 
Igor: 
So, you’ve gone to a place of healing. How many of you had a sense that you 
had some kind of mild healing as a result of being at that place, so you had 
some benefit? It may have been intense or it may have been mild, but at least 
something not noticeable, right? 
 
 
Let’s see if we can amplify that a bit. Again we’re going to go with the 
spontaneous route for now. What I’d like you to do is again go to your 
unconscious and ask to go to a place of healing. It may be the same or it may 
be different. I’m going to warn you right now. 
 
 
The reason for it is I’m about to add something that might change your 
unconscious’s expectation. When you get there, I would like for you to 
specifically ask your unconscious mind to bring in a healer, some person that 
symbolizes a healer for you. 
 
 
Do not ask for a specific person. Just ask for them to bring something and be 
surprised by whoever turns up. When they show up, allow them to perform 
some form of symbolic healing on you.

It may be through some magic acts or some lights. It might be through some 
actual medication that you take or a potion. Who knows? You won’t know 
until it’s happened.  
 
 
The point is you’re going to specifically ask for a healing for something. You 
don’t necessarily know what it is yet but it’s something that you need in your 
life. Consciously don’t try to choose anything. Just leave it open for now and 
we’ll onto something specific after this.  
 
 
So, it’s not just a place of healing. It’s a place of healing with a symbolic healer 
– in other words an archetypal figure of the healer arriving to actually perform 
their version of whatever they do on you. Experience that and then we’ll 
come back and discuss that, and then we’ll build that into the next round. Off 
you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m asking my unconscious mind now to transport me first to my place of 
relaxation. There I am in hot water outside in a hot springs. I see the scenery, 
the mountain scenery, and I sit in the hot water which really relaxes me.  
 
 
From there I ask my unconscious mind to transport me again to a place of 
healing and I see colorful walls, rainbow colors, wooden walls and I know it’s 
the place a friend of mine built by himself. It’s a special room with a wooden 
floor and wooden walls and the floor is wood color and the walls are painted 
very colorful. 
 
 
And I can see a sword, various sorts of weapons but for me it has some kind of 
– its healing symbols for me. So, there are a few weapons on the wall kind of 
like protection for me and there’s the entrance and my friend standing in the 
door.  
 
 
He’s very short, long hair, very curly dark hair, dark skin. He’s wearing jeans 
and a shirt and he walks towards me and looks at me, and then I look into his 
eyes and I can feel a lot of power. It’s like those eyes are emitting a power, so 
I ask him to perform some kind of healing on me, something I need in my life 
to change.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
552 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
I ask him to help me with his power. He tells me to sit down in front of him 
and he just looks at me. So, I cross my legs sitting down. He jumps up and 
performs a dance for me. He’s just changed clothes. He’s in dancing clothes 
now and he’s performing a dance for me and he’s laughing, and he sits back 
down and asks me understand? 
 
 
And I have to laugh. I’m smiling at him and I have a very warm feeling inside 
me and find my arms and hands and something melting. I just let that take 
place. My friend changes back into his normal clothes, looking at me, and 
again he gets up and he changes into training clothes and then he performs 
some exercises. 
 
 
And while he was laughing before, he’s more serious now and very focused. I 
can tell how focused he is and how focused he can use his body, how much 
strength he has and powers by focusing his mind, his attention. I just watch 
him doing his stunts and he tells me take your time to learn this focus. It’s 
dark now and he sits back down. I feel more focused. 
 
 
Now he tells me to get up and walk outside the room and take a walk and just 
look at nothing in particular while walking, and it feels like I’m accumulating 
energy doing that, energy that I can use for whatever task I want to use it. I’m 
now standing on top of a mountain and can see the scenery, the forest below 
us, a lot of opportunity… 
 
Igor: 
All right, start winding up your process. 
 
Student: I’m now scanning my body, grounding myself. 
 
Igor: 
How did that go? Was that interesting? Who were either surprised or 
delighted or both by what happened there? 
 
Student: When I was eleven I lost all my hair very suddenly. My parents took me from 
one doctor to the next, they were desperate for solutions. I was desperate as 
a child and I was desperate when I went through puberty obviously. I tried 
everything under the sun since then to get back my hair and my eyelASHes 
etc. So when I was facing the healer right now, it was me standing suddenly in 
front of me. Now I realize why nothing has worked before because it is me, 
having to give healing to myself I suppose.

Igor: 
Well, I hope it works out as well as you intended, honestly. This is fantastic. 
Again, the whole healing process is a bit of a mystery, especially with things 
that mystify the medical community as well. So, you can each day as it comes 
that way, right? What else did you guys notice or realize or experience? 
 
Student: When I was at my healing place has a boon of natural water, which is nice, 
and when I was there I was waiting for my symbolic healer to come, and it 
wasn’t happening and I began to get a little bit frustrated by it and I 
remembered to be benign, and then the Dalai Lama showed up. 
 
Igor: 
That’s kind of nice, a personal appearance. 
 
Student: And I offered him if he would wish to get into pool and he said he already 
was. 
 
Igor: 
Of course. 
 
Student: That was nice. 
 
Igor: 
Did you enjoy that? 
 
Student: I did really. 
 
Igor: 
Good. Well done. Excellent. What other things happened to you or surprised 
you? 
 
Student: I had a really – I’ve been struggling like I’m sure many people with just getting 
spontaneous images, ones you know I’m really sure I haven’t consciously 
thought of, and this one I just said to my subconscious can you just give me 
somewhere where I haven’t been before?  
 
 
And going back to my relaxation place, it was a place in Fiji where I’ve been 
before. It’s just a beautiful place. This time I ended up in an ice hospital, like a 
nice hotel with nice fur on the bed and everything else.  
 
 
For the first exercise, I actually did ask can you bring someone in because I 
haven’t been able to really get someone in to my exercises before, and the 
Abominable Snowman – I said oh wow this is interesting. I said okay let’s go 
with this.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

So, actually I offered him a gift. It was an orange because obviously there 
aren’t too many orange groves where he’s from. So, anyway we went back 
this time – and it took me a little while to get there because I was just open 
like you asked us to be and I ended up in the same place. Along came my 
healer. This time his teeth had loads of orange (makes a sign like slime) 
 
Igor: 
That’s a nice detail. 
 
Student: Did you enjoy that? Yes. So, I said are you ready to return the gift and he said 
yes. 
 
Igor: 
It’s surprising how emotional it can be, right? 
 
Student: Yes. With that, I had that huge emotional surge. It was one of relief and I 
suppose just the knowledge that something special was about to happen. He 
ran his hands over me and I could see these sort of cartoon shaped objects 
just sort of popping out of my body into his hand. It was just like a scanner, I 
suppose, a bit like sci-fi stuff. Anyway that was my experience but the 
emotion was definitely unexpected. 
 
Igor: 
And also intense, right? 
 
Student: Huge. It’s in my body still. 
 
Igor: 
That to me is one of the litmus tests – the surprise and the emotion and as 
both intensify, because you can have very surprising things and you can have 
very emotional things. That to me is one of the litmus tests that good 
unconscious activity is going on. 
 
 
Of course as your life progresses, you’ll have to figure out what this is about 
and so on but congratulations. 
 
Student: I took the time like you said to just sit with it. 
 
Igor: 
That’s huge importance, right? 
 
Student: And not do anything. Just be in the moment. It was wonderful. 
 
Igor: 
The thing that’s interesting is of course how you started off. You did the same 
thing twice. The first time you were okay with no particular result of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
555 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
consequence, and as a result the payoff was the second time you returned. 
Surprisingly that’s when it came.  
 
 
That’s what we’re looking for. That’s the relationship being fixed and then 
your unconscious mind saying great, you passed the test. Here’s your reward. 
It’s good, isn’t it? 
 
Student: Brilliant. 
 
Igor: 
Good man, well done. 
 
Student: Thank you. 
 
Student: When I was trying to get a relaxing place, I got that, and then when I was 
trying to get the healing place, I didn’t get a physical place. I got a feeling, a 
vibration and then the sanctuary also became a vibration. So, everything 
became a vibration. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. 
 
Student: And that was something that went through my entire body. 
 
Igor: 
So, you could feel it quite intently? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Once again, this is a good sign of unconscious activity in action, isn’t it? Thank 
you for sharing that. I appreciate that. We only have one problem with the 
kind of process we just engaged in. This is a nice little bit of proof – at least for 
those of us who got that kind of intense result.  
 
 
I realize not all of you did, but that’s part of the training until you’re able to 
access those things more easily, but the big problem in having this kind of 
spontaneous healing occur is you have no idea what it’s actually done, so 
there’s no way of proving it other than a strong unconscious response, the 
vibration, the emotion, the surprise. 
 
 
We don’t actually know has this actually fixed something in me and can you 
go out and test it? So, I’d like to do just that right now so that you can actually 
have an experience of that.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

You understand of course that you’re training that and in time for those of 
you who don’t quite do this, you of course will be able to do the more basic 
things first and come back to this again. 
 
The Inner Healer 
 
Igor: 
This exercise is actually really simple. It’s identical to what you’ve just done in 
many ways. We’re just going to add two little things. The first thing I want you 
to do is I would like for you to choose a genuine problem in your life, but 
please make it a small one. Just get some easy wins in first that you can get 
some confidence with, and then allow yourself to use the same process for 
more important things in your life.  
 
 
I don’t really mind what it is. Whether it’s emotional healing or a physical 
healing, I really don’t mind too much, but something that you can test again 
afterwards. That’s important. 
 
 
I guess the emotional ones are a little easier to test because you can go into a 
situation and see if it triggers the same sort of response, but it’s up to you 
really. But consciously I want you to decide ahead of time I would like this 
please and please make sure it’s a small thing. Then do the same stuff. Go to a 
place of healing. Maybe it’s the same one or maybe it’s a new one.  
 
 
The second addition I want you to make here is when you call your healer in, 
I’d like for you to let them call in someone else who has exactly the same 
problem as you chose. 
 
 
Let’s say it’s a fear of some sort. Let’s have the person come in with the same 
fear and I’d like you to watch the healer work with this other person in 
removing the problem until the person is absolutely convinced and totally 
happy, and you can see it’s had a resolution. 
 
 
Once that’s happened, step in and become that person. Then go through the 
whole process again. So, it’s essentially the same only this time you’re going 
to choose something which you can measure afterwards, and you include that 
sense of the stepping in process we talked about earlier today – it’s called a 
Deep Trance Identification (DTI) – as part of that cycle.

Do you all understand what I’m asking you to do? That’s going to be the last 
exercise. 
 
Student: After I step in do I step back out? 
 
Igor: 
I apologize. Of course. That’s going to be a choice of yours. You can become 
the person or let them become you, and then when you finish you can walk 
out as yourself. As long as you leave as yourself, that’s the important part. 
 
Student: That’s what I thought. 
 
Igor: 
Please don’t come back as someone else because they haven’t paid.  
 
Student: Should it be someone I know? 
 
Igor: 
Not someone you know. Not someone you actually know in real life. Let your 
unconscious bring in someone who symbolizes the same problem that you’re 
working on. So, it will be a stranger to your eyes but hopefully somewhat 
familiar in other ways. 
 
 
All right, this is the last exercise. Let’s not take too long because they’ll kick us 
out shortly. Go ahead and start that now and the sooner you start, the more 
likely you’ll get the chance to finish. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’m choosing a problem half the time now. I want resolve. I’m asking my 
unconscious mind to take me directly to the healing place. I can see the 
wooden floor again. The colorful wooden walls and weapons on the walls for 
protection. I turn around and I see the wall again opening, my friend is in the 
door, wearing blue jeans and a blue shirt now. He’s very dark skinned, dark 
hair. He comes in and looks for a place to sit down.   
 
 
He asks me what he can do for me. I tell him about a problem. So, he jumps 
up and goes outside and he brings in another person with the same problem. 
It’s actually a girl, and he shows me he points out the problem and then he 
starts dancing.

He’s got his dancing clothes on and he’s dancing around and she’s just looking 
at him as he’s dancing around her. Her eyes are affixed now on one point, so 
she can kind of see him. She’s in a trance while that happens she changes...  
 
 
I can see her face more clearly now. I can see her feeling and my friend’s still 
dancing and not getting sucked into becoming her. I’m in a trance and my 
friend dancing around me. I’m getting the feeling of what the change feels 
like. Somehow the room changes a little bit. I can see outside there’s a 
window there.  
 
 
I can see the sky outside, the clouds and overall a very calming scene outside, 
the green of the ocean in the distance and now my friend has stopped 
dancing, putting on his normal clothing, sitting down and stepping outside of 
the girl, becoming myself with the change, bringing that with me.  
 
 
Sitting down in front of my friend and a girl just walks up. I thank her while 
she’s walking up and she waves back. She thanks my friend and closes the 
door behind her. I’m just sitting in front of my friend now, thanking him. He 
just nods. I’m coming to my place of relaxation, looking out over the 
mountains I see trees and feel the heat of the hot wires around me. 
 
Igor: 
For those of you who have come back, how was that? Was that interesting? 
Who wants to share their experiences or ask a question? 
 
Student: First of all, I can’t get the thought out of my head of movie Elysium. 
 
Igor: 
If it’s a potent symbol for you, you may as well use it, right? 
 
Student: It works for me and my healer turned out to be the Siri voice from the Apple 
iPhone, so it was a computerized healing. I suffer from mild psoriasis at 
certain times of the year. I’m very lucky it doesn’t cover my whole back, it’s 
not anything like that. The person that popped in to get cured was one of 
these people who has all over the body psoriasis with scales and that sort of 
stuff. I watched that person get into one of the beds and the scan sort of 
happened and as the scan was happening you could see all the scales… 
 
Igor: 
The scales coming off and stuff, yes. Awesome. 
 
Student:  Disappearing, 100% healing, and I got in the bed and was cured as well, so it 
was absolutely fantastic.

Igor: 
Awesome. So, it’s good that you felt great and remember the proof of this 
pudding is in your experience, not just how you felt emotionally because this 
wasn’t an emotional problem. It was a physical one. Is this the time of year 
that you normally have that sort of issue? 
 
Student: Usually it gets worse in the winter. 
 
Igor: 
Well, then this is a good time to test it. You’ll know when you don’t have the 
same kind of condition as you would normally otherwise have had. This is very 
important to me.  
 
 
It’s very important that you do some of this work in a very testable way so 
that it’s black and white. It’s either worked or it hasn’t worked. Maybe it’s 
improved slightly but it hasn’t worked all the way yet. That’s a good start, so 
you’re learning that you’re on the right path.  
 
 
You just may have to do more, but if you don’t include things that are testable 
this way, then this work leaves itself open far too easily for self-delusion. It 
just felt nice, it was great, I’m sure it worked. It’s important that you’re able 
to test it. 
 
Student: According to traditional medicine it’s not a curable disease. 
 
Igor: 
Arthur here is a skin doctor, so hopefully he’ll back me up on this. If not, he’s 
fired. Psoriasis as far as I understand, it is one of those conditions that 
responds very much to suggestion, hypnotic processes and so on. Your skin is 
a barometer of your mental state. 
 
 
For example, I suspect when you get stressed the condition gets worse, and 
when you’re calm the condition is easier, right? So, what we’re creating is at 
the very least the context in which the aggravating factors are no longer 
present, so at the very least the impact of it is reduced. But again, we won’t 
know that until you’ve been in the context. So, now that winter is coming 
you’ll find out and things are different. That’s going to be the litmus test.  
 
 
You’ve got to be able to know if it’s working so that you can either make 
adjustments and improve the method, or it’s working in which case you can 
be happy and be on your way. I appreciate that. Thank you. What else did you 
guys notice?

Student: The healer turned out to be a drug and I’m not very interested in drugs, so I 
was quite surprised. The healing place was actually inside and it was like the 
cells that you see in trees, where the sap is pulled up. Those kinds of cells and 
it’s all about my bladder, so that’s interesting.  
 
 
So, this drug whatever it was, it was given to somebody else who has the 
same problem. I stepped inside her, felt different slightly and then stepped 
out and said we’ll see, and then my question was I want to not get up three 
times at night. 
 
Igor: 
Well, we’ll see what happens tonight then. Again, I’m glad you chose that as a 
thing because in the same way as Simon’s issue it’s something that’s actually 
testable, so you’ll know. Either there’s an improvement, there’s a complete 
remission of the issue or it’s exactly the same, and each one will give you 
information as to what to do next. 
 
 
Even if it has had no physical impact, that’s still not a failure. That just lets you 
know okay great, that’s something now we can start working towards and 
then build up better results. Thank you. I appreciate that. Does anyone else 
want to comment? 
 
Student: I want to share something interesting. Before coming to this program, I fully 
subscribed to the power of the subconscious because one thing I would like to 
share. My brother who’s a doctor, he said you have hypertension and you 
have diabetes and you have all these diseases. I said as far as I’m concerned, I 
think I’m only obese. Apart from that I don’t have any other problems. He said 
okay let’s run the checks. They ran the checks and surprisingly everything is 
normal. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Good for you. Give him a round of applause for that. 
 
Student: All along, my mind has been telling me, when other people make a comment, 
you are heading towards a heart attack, you are heading towards this or that. 
So, all along my mind is telling me don’t think about those you are free. As 
long as you’re mentally free you are physically free. 
 
 
When I went to the place of healing, the healer came and I said what is your 
problem? So, I said to him my problem is that I want to become thin. So, he 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
561 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
said so what do you want me to do? I said you’ll bring somebody in and you’ll 
make them thin. I want to see how you do it on him. 
 
 
He said but you already know how you have to become thin. I said okay then 
let me transform to you, so then I get the feeling of how to become thin. He 
said nothing doing, there’s no shortcut to success. You start walking five 
kilometers every day and you will become thin. There is absolutely nothing 
else I can do, I did my bit, now it’s up to you to do your bit. 
 
Igor: 
I like his unconscious mind, don’t you guys? Give him a round of applause. 
That’s awesome, and I particularly appreciate the very natural dialog that 
comes in there. Sometimes the only person who can be as blunt to you is you, 
right? Thank you for that.  
 
Student: After lunch I came back with some sort of tingly congestion thing going on 
that was just starting, so I decided to work on that. The healer brought in 
another me and went to work on that person, and it didn’t look like enough to 
me and then I didn’t step into that person. The healer just turned to me and 
started working on me. 
 
Igor: 
That’s good. 
 
Student: It’s not enough what you did to her, so I need a little bit more. So, he did one 
more thing to me and now I’m fine. 
 
Igor: 
I like that because it’s an instant test. Give her a round of applause for that. 
That’s very important. It is really important to me that you don’t just take this 
on trust or faith or because someone on the stage once said so. Use your own 
experiences. That is the only measurement of value. It’s your own experience. 
 
 
If it’s helping you, then do more of it. If it isn’t, then either change what 
you’re doing or stop doing it. Thank you. That’s great. It’s great to hear the 
thing actually in action. 
 
Student: The problem I decided I was going to solve was actually not a problem, but it’s 
a problem because I’ve convinced myself it’s a problem. So, I decided I was 
going to get a healer, so I got a friend. I thought okay fair enough. I’ll bring the 
healer out and I had three people.

They were old friends and people I just admire, and they got together and 
said okay we’re going to put each of our qualities that you admire in us in you, 
but over the course of the practices for the healing there seemed to be a 
theme.  
 
 
Everyone keeps pushing my button. Every time they push it, I get this jolt in 
my body and the whole idea is you have baggage, you’re holding onto it, just 
let it go. It’s not there. It’s just your baggage where you find it hard to really 
let your problems go. I swear I never just, what they decided to do was we’re 
all going to push your button at the same time. I swear I never had so much 
pain in my life. It was really, really hard. 
 
 
It was so bad I thought okay I’m not even going to test it because it’s either I 
live with this pain or I let it go. Now I’m back thinking should I let it go or stick 
with the pain? I haven’t decided yet. 
 
Igor: 
But it’s your choice, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Good. 
 
Student: I just want to add something to your story. I have a friend who’s old now but 
many years ago he was diagnosed with some Aspergers. He was very young at 
the time. So, just relate to your story, the doctor said you’ve got to live with 
this for the rest of your life and he says cancel that. The doctor says, why do 
you cancel that and he said I’m not going to take that suggestion. He said 
there’s nothing you can do.  
 
 
Then he says cancel that. So, it kept on going like that and the doctor got very 
upset and he walked out of the office, but the moral of the story is whenever 
you have – that goes for everyone. Whenever you have somebody tells to you 
don’t want to have it just say cancel that. It’s not going to go in. 
 
Igor: 
So of course the phrase will depend on each one of you. Some of you may 
have a more colorful version of saying that. Okay, we worked hard today and 
hopefully you’ve started to experience the potential that this tool has for you. 
Would that be fair to say?

For three days you’ve worked hard building the tools, and today I tried to 
show you some of the ways you can use those tools. There’s one more thing I 
want to do with you tomorrow, but even if we didn’t get around to that – 
which of course we will – who here has a sense that going home now just with 
the stuff you’ve got so far, plus of course all the potential it has within it, that 
you have something really worthwhile, something that can really help you in 
your own life’s journey to make a big different, to make a positive impact on 
your life? Excellent. That’s all I wanted to hear. Did you have a question? 
 
Student: Actually no. I was just raising my hand to that. However, under the 
circumstances my little thing for the healing place was called the pink place 
and everything in it is pink. So I went there and I was sitting on the sofa and I 
was waiting for this healer to come. It wasn’t coming, wasn’t coming and then 
it was you and Dr. Spock, and you came and it was for just biting fingernails. 
 
 
I did this in Amsterdam but of course it didn’t work. I quit biting my fingernails 
and bit the fingers. So, I had my friend who died at 39 so he can’t meet you. 
So, you worked on my friend who bit his fingernails and so he did everything, 
and he used that to help someone who quit smoking what are you more than 
smoking. So, he did it and then I was the next person and then we worked 
together, same story and then afterwards I gave you a star for the person you 
healed. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you. 
 
Student: But the problem was then I started laughing because you were falling forward 
like those generals with all those stars on their chest. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. All right, I think you deserve a break for the evening. If you 
want more of this mind mayhem, let’s be here on time tomorrow, shall we? 
Have a good night.

DVD 17 – How To Practice The Beyond Self 
Hypnosis System & The Practice Pitfalls To 
Avoid 
 
 
Guidelines For Practice 
 
Igor: 
Welcome everyone. How many people are staying in the hotel here, by the 
way, hands up? Did you enjoy the party last night? It was wonderful wasn’t 
it? I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep and instead, uh, if you can’t beat 
them join them. So I went to sleep and joined their party mentally, it was 
great fun. I met wonderful people. At one point I got very drunk and fell 
asleep in the corner and I woke up this morning in my bed. It was magic.  
 
 
Okay, today I want to go through a number of processes with you. Before we 
do that I want to talk a little about your practice when you go home. You’ve 
covered a wealth of material, so how do you ensure you actually do this stuff 
going home? I’d like to leave you with a couple guidelines; you can call them 
rules of thumb, so you can call them rules and not laws that you will have 
your hand chopped off if you do not follow these.  
 
 
These are just guidelines for making your life easier and if they don’t fit your 
life then don’t follow them. This is just stuff that’s helped me.  
 
Student: Is it homework? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, exactly. This is what’s called night learning. This is not so much 
homework, it’s more a question of where do you put your focus on, because 
there’s a lot of exercises you’ve done over the last four days. Where are you 
going to focus your attention? You don’t have, I presume most of you; you 
can’t suddenly take off the next six months to religiously focus on just doing 
these exercises.  
 
 
I imagine, either your family would get very upset or your boss would get 
upset and fire you or the tax man would decide to put you in prison because 
you forgot to pay your taxes at the end of the tax year and life just starts 
falling apart.

1. Whenever you have one minute, six seconds is enough. 
 
 
You’re better off doing 10-60 second little mini things throughout the day in 
between times than trying to save up and find 10 minutes in a very busy 
schedule or, like what most people do and that is to find an hour. Most 
people can’t find an hour. If you can find an hour, well done, I’m excited for 
you and we’ll talk about that stuff as well.  
 
 
It doesn’t really fit in most people’s lives, so a minute is enough. What does a 
minute? It means you’re driving to work, you park your car and you spend a 
minute before you get out. No one needs to know. As far as they’re 
concerned you’re just having a thought, looking out the window and going 
huh, interesting. If you really want to emphasize what you’re doing just go 
huh, interesting. 
 
 
So no one needs to know; that minute’s easy to find. Same thing, you’re 
sitting at your desk, you’ve worked hard you need a bit of a breather again 
you can just go huh, mentalization is very useful. Mindfulness is a little 
different, because if you start doing this in the middle of an office, it doesn’t 
work so well. As a lawyer I tried this once. It was like 3:00 a.m., I thought I 
was safe, because I was falling asleep while working on a client document. I 
thought I would do some press ups, pushups to wake myself up.  
 
 
It’s 3:00 a.m., my boss walks in on me. How? The mindfulness practice, you 
have to determine where you can do it, but even that, the same adage is true. 
Just a minute is fine and again, we’re not even counting time now we’re just 
counting breaths and sometimes afterwards. All of you here got to a point 
where five minutes was actually quite a comfortable bit of mindfulness to do. 
Don’t worry so much about the time, fit in the time you have available.  
 
 
May I present to you an idea that I’ve come across that should fit into most of 
your lives, not everyone’s because no one does this, that will make it 
ridiculously easy to find time to practice these kinds of work, the ASH Method 
at home? May I offer this to you? 
 
Student: Yes.  
 
Igor: 
Does anyone here ever watch TV? Admit it, television, it’s part of our lives, it 
sucks our brains out. Each country has different length commercial breaks, 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
566 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
but they tend to be relatively uniform. I believe America may have the 
longest television breaks. When you’re watching whatever program you’re 
watching and the break comes on, all you do is turn the sound off and use the 
break time to do your work. 
 
 
Why let the advertisers brainwASH you into buying stuff you don’t even want, 
when you can turn the volume off, do some work for five minutes, come on 
back, more commercials, carry on a bit longer oh yeah still going, that’s great, 
go for a little longer and then you carry on watching your program.  
 
 
It’s a very easy place for a lot of people to find time to do this work, because 
a lot of people watch a lot of TV so there’s a natural pause point there. So you 
get the idea that you’re better off just finding moments throughout the day 
to do it in, than trying to save up 30 minutes to an hour to where you focus 
on the whole thing and it doesn’t happen.  
 
 
So the first guideline is that a minute is enough. Don’t snub your nose at a 
minute, because it starts a habit. It starts an expectation. It’s like the money 
and mind program we talked about earlier. Once you start very small, for 
example, one of the methods in there is in terms of destroying debt, people 
get so overloaded they don’t even think about it anymore, as opposed to just 
paying off a dollar, Euro, or doing something like that. It gets the process 
going, your mind then thinks this is important and it will find more.  
 
 
There’s a great law called Parkinson’s Law, which was made up by someone 
who was back in the old British Empire days, saw the craziness of the 
bureaucracy expanding. So it originally started off along the lines of, 
bureaucracies expand to use the cash available for it. Then that got 
transformed to work expands to fill the amount of time you have for it.  
 
 
I think that general idea of expansion of things is a human phenomenon. 
Someone has given me a nice version of that recently, which is your expenses 
will expand to exceed your income. That’s how most people lead their lives, 
right? But if you’re doing one minute practices, even just one minute a day 
but you’re doing it consistently, you’re doing it regularly. In other words, it’s 
important to you, then that minute has a habit of expanding and it’ll become 
five minutes.  
 
Then it will be two or three- five minute sessions. Before you know it you’re 
doing quite a bit of work, but you’re fitting it into your life without trying to 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
567 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
force it into your life. Do you see the distinction? The reason people wouldn’t 
start with a minute is because it’s only a minute, what can I do in a minute? 
Nothing gets achieved, but remember that minute will expand over time. So 
don’t denigrate it and use it as an excuse to do nothing.  
 
You get the idea of that guideline? 
 
2. The second guideline is a little often is better than a lot once.  
 
Again, the tendency people have is they’ll push off here I’ll do it on the 
weekend. On the weekend I have lots of time, I’ll make two hour sessions and 
make up for all the stuff I haven’t done this week. If you haven’t done an ASH 
practice all day, then maybe just a minute before you go to sleep, you can 
spare a minute, 60 seconds. You’re probably sparing that anyway when 
you’re busy turning over and not falling asleep properly.  
 
The fact that you can probably fall asleep more quickly afterwards is just a 
bonus out of that. Again, all I’m trying to do is point out all the mistakes I’ve 
made and all the excuses that have stopped me from practicing, so that you 
can get on with the actual work of practicing.  
 
3. The next general idea is every exercise counts.  
 
In other words, if in doubt, do something. Something is better than nothing. 
Every one of those exercises has a purpose and a value, so if you feel like one 
just do it. Is that necessarily as systematic as it could be? No, but before we 
can get systematic, you have to have something to be systematic about. You 
have to have a practice, so you’re better off building a habit and then 
systemizing it than going through the whole effort of trying to systemize it up 
front.  
 
Some of you have a slightly different personality and you want to do all the 
work up front and then start practicing and that’s okay. Just bear in mind if six 
weeks down the line you’re still preparing your perfect method, chances are 
you’ll never find it. You’ll more than likely starting doing it wrong, in other 
words, doing it haphazardly as long as you’re creating a habit out of it and 
then a system will emerge out of that.  
 
Does that make sense?

4. My next little piece of advice is, go through all the exercises from the 
beginning all the way through in the same sequence we’ve you’ve 
doing so far on your own, at some point, at least once.  
 
It doesn’t mean you have to take four days out to do it all over again. 
Actually, in your own time it’ll take a lot less because there’ll be less talking 
and more action when you understand the nuances more. But even that 
aside, what I mean is even if you just do; today I’ll do a minute where I’ll walk 
through my room. Tomorrow I’ll do a minute of walking around my house. 
The next day I’ll do a couple minutes walking around my neighborhood. 
Notice how a minute just naturally expanded.  
 
So that you’re working your way through the process, again so you get 
familiar and you get a sense of where am I strong? Where am I weak? Where 
am I bored? Where am I stressed? Remember boredom and stress are telling 
you where your strengths and weaknesses lie. 
 
I want to go back on the rules here.  
 
5. If in doubt as to what to practice, mindfulness is the key. 
 
Mentalizations, as we’ve experienced some with very powerful impacts and 
so on, but if in doubt as to what to practice, practice a simple mindfulness, 
whether it’s breathing, body scan or movement, whichever you intrinsically 
like the most, because you’re more likely to practice that. Because, it builds 
that muscle that let’s everything else happen as well, right? 
 
If you’re relatively happy with all the different levels because you’ve been all 
the way through on your own, remember the three exercises we did 
yesterday? The tour of the neighborhood. Walking through different 
environments to meet people and tracking them, to practice the seven rules 
of Flight Club and the third one was (have to look through my notes again)… 
do you remember what the third one was again? 
 
Student: Interacting.  
 
Igor: 
Interacting was the second one wasn’t it? 
 
Student: Move through it was the second and interacting was the third.  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
569 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so interacting was the third one already, I thought that was the second, 
but I could be wrong. In that case yeah, the second one was move through, 
okay. So the second one is about movement so you can stabilize spontaneity 
and I guess then the third one, is interact with them, because that’s the core 
idea.  
 
 
On top of this list, the only thing I would add is a good place bad place. If 
there’s only one exercise you do for your mentalizations, it would be good 
place bad place and the reason for everything else you did before, is to make 
it easy to get a strong or good emotional version of good place bad place.  
 
In fact, I think good place bad place is such a useful exercise in terms of what 
it does and in terms of how your brain gets stimulated by it, because it has 
mindfulness built into it that is served as an easy substitute for all your 
mindfulness practices too. Because remember, the essence of good place bad 
place is the good place, you’re just mindful of it, you appreciate it but you 
don’t get sucked into it or attached to it.  
 
The bad place, you’re going to have benign attention on it, you’ll get sucked 
into the drama or whatever negative things are happening, you become an 
observer but with a benign attention, so you’re still connected to it but 
without benign attention. So there is a level of cognition going on there. I 
think it’s a useful substitute for any of the other mindfulness practices if time 
really is at a crunch for you. 
 
Get the idea? 
 
So if you think about it, in terms of what you practice, whilst you have a large 
scope, you can go through the entire program and pick and choose anything 
of interest. The very basic default is very simple. Have mindfulness practice if 
you want to build that muscle, especially if you need to build more safety. 
You have these three which epitomize each of the different levels… 
 
Stability 
Spontaneity 
Intention 
 
… and in the good place bad place, which kind of does a little bit of 
everything. In time for example, we haven’t done this just because it would 
require more of you than most of you would kindly be able to do. You can

play good place bad place, whilst interacting with people or figures in that 
landscape. That will take more out of you, so I would wait before you get to 
that point, but that’s the synopsis of everything, because you’re doing 
everything.  
 
You can transform, teleport, stabilize, interact, show respect and you need to 
have equanimity and you need to have mindfulness to have that equanimity, 
so it has all the things built into it. But, and this is especially for you folks at 
home who think I can do everything… do not start there. Leave that to a later 
practice, just somewhere you can kind of develop towards. 
 
You may notice, instead of giving you this complicated time table and 
schedule of all the things you’ve practiced, I’m focusing on some basic, simple 
parts of the whole process. These are the key elements of the machine. 
That’s specifically because if you make it too complicated for yourself, the 
chances you will do it are slim to none and I would put my money on the 
none rather than the slim.  
 
Here’s another guideline/rule of thumb for you. 
 
6. If you get bored with an exercise because you’ve done it a lot, you 
have two choices… add something into it to make it more challenging 
or do a different exercise. You have a lot to choose from. 
 
We’ll be sending you all these notes, so you’ll have them for yourself as well, 
to remind you of all the things you’ve done. So either you add something to 
add interest to it again, to challenge yourself or you change exercises and do 
a different one, just for novelty value for something different.  
 
How many people here exercise regularly, hands up? It’s the same principle in 
the gym isn’t it, once you’ve done a certain exercise for too long it stops 
being of value to you. You have to change to a different kind of exercise 
routine for a while to mix things up a bit and confuse your muscles and then 
over time you come back to it and the value will be back in the original 
exercise.  
 
Or, you step up the intensity of it, but really at some point, there’s no one 
exercise I know of that doesn’t eventually give you some kind of burnout, so 
you have lots to choose from to give yourself a bit of variety as well. The key 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
571 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
again is interest. Keep your interest levels up, so move around things so your 
curiosity levels and interest levels stay simulated. 
 
Why make life hard for yourself? The point at which you can make life hard 
for yourself is that maybe a year or two down the line we’ve been doing lots 
and lots of this and then you make it harder just to challenge yourself. But 
why do that in the beginning if it just ends up leading to failure for most 
people? Get the idea? 
 
Student: For those people who doubt the practicality of the minute, I actually 
conducted an experiment the beginning of October through the end of 
October with kettle bells. I was having trouble sticking to a particular routine 
and I thought okay, let’s see if I can do this incrementally. What I did was to 
start a new program with double kettle bells and doing something called 
clean, it’s a particular exercise within the kettle bell program in the rack 
position, which is holding two kettle bells up on the chest for time, one 
minute. 
 
 
I started with 16 kilos either side and by the end of the month I was holding 
24 kilos either side, for a minute. So, when I get back I’m going to be 
extending the time and that was every day that one minute, and what I 
found, I was doing it multiple times during the day. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the key right there. Because you only give yourself a minute it’s like 
easy, which means you’re suddenly inspired saying I could do it a little bit like 
that and you’re just doing it, because what’s a minute anyway? A minute, 
leaving a minute late to go to work doesn’t really make much different. An 
extra minute in the car doesn’t make much difference.  
 
 
You can lock yourself in a bathroom stall for a minute and no one will think 
it’s too weird. 
 
Student: What I did was I did it while I was waiting for the water to boil for my coffee 
in the jug.  
 
Igor: 
That’s awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Was that useful? I’m trying to 
make it as easy for you as possible to succeed with it and I know that the 
temptation is to do it all, but if you try doing it all then you probably end up 
doing nothing and something is much better than nothing.

Student: Just to add to that. I work for the airlines, routine is important and that’s 
what I was going to add. Instead of taking the train to the office when I get off 
from the hotel, I choose to walk and that’s my ritual. So as soon as I get out of 
the van I know that is my ritual to go into mindfulness training. At least once 
a day I get to do that and it just kicks right in because I do it every time I’m in 
an airport. 
 
Igor: 
That reminds me of another point which doesn’t suit everyone’s lifestyles, 
but it’s a recommendation that you can try anyway. Having a regular time at 
which you do these things, definitely helps create the habit to keep doing 
these things. The reason I have that as one of the major guidelines is because 
some people will say oh, it’s not that time yet I can’t do a minute right now. 
 
 
Because they’re using it as an excuse, like oh, my minute will come up in an 
hour so I’ll do it then. No, that’s not how it works, right? You give yourself 
some time… when I come home from the office I’ll do a minute whatever 
happens, but if you happen to have a minute to spare anyway then do it 
anyways and it will build over time. That’s the important thing.  
 
Student: Yeah, that’s an example of that. For those people who drive to work, if you 
get out and have your coffee five minutes before and then you get in the car, 
two minutes after then you have two minutes every day that you can do that 
or two minutes after. Just build it into the routine. 
 
Igor: 
That’s the thing, you have to build it into your life; hence, find 60 seconds is 
much easier to find time for than actually even five minutes. Most people say 
I haven’t got five minutes to spare. They do they just don’t know where they 
are. They have to go looking and it takes them an hour to find those five 
minutes, but they didn’t have the hour to find them.  
 
 
That’s where the problem comes in. Finding a minute is easy just look over 
your shoulder and there it is.  
 
Student: I just wanted more clarification about that advanced good place bad place. 
With people would that be like doing a good place bad place for customer 
interaction, like a good one and a bad one? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, and so much more. Because I think good place bad place is really at the 
heart of the whole ASH net. Can you see what we’re talking about, because it 
has a mindfulness, the equanimity practice, a mentalizations practice and the 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
573 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
ability to stabilize things, you have teleportation because you’re moving 
between places and you have the opportunity for transformation, interaction 
and showing respect. 
 
 
It has a lot built into it. It’s not the whole method, but it condenses the whole 
method into one. You can do a huge amount of things with good place bad 
place that you probably haven’t thought about. May I give you some 
examples?  
 
Student: Go ahead. 
 
Igor: 
What you were mentioning there was actually correct. What can you do with 
good place bad place? Initially, in the level we’re at right now, you just turn it 
up, you feel good… yeah I enjoyed that. You feel bad, that’s okay I’m cool 
with it. You feel good again to round it off nicely.  
 
 
Then the answer is you could go somewhere pleasant and have interaction 
with people to interact with. So you go somewhere pleasant and when I was 
watching whilst you guys were doing this, I went to, it was like a South 
American village, having a big fiesta party. It was a great time, really enjoyed 
it. There wee people dancing in the streets, music playing and it’s like yeah, 
this is a good place.  
 
 
Then when you go to a bad place you want another interaction, so I just ask 
for a bad place right now and I got Jaws, so I’m swimming in the ocean, jaws 
is coming and I’m a little scared of this whole thing. I’m going to let him bite 
me if he wants to bite me. I’m going to have a chat with him. He’s going to 
have a chat with me or I’m going to sit with him until he interacts with me in 
some way or swims away or does whatever. There’s a level of interaction 
going on now, as opposed to mere observation. 
 
 
That’s a little harder, so that’s another level. Another one is, and I realize this 
doesn’t apply to everyone in this group, but some people have hot spots, you 
know like when something, a particular thing happens and they just go flying 
off the handle really annoyed and more obsessed, which makes them more 
feared and so on. I know it doesn’t apply to anyone here, but if it did… that 
would be a wonderful thing to have good place bad place in.  
 
 
So, let’s take the example of someone who is afraid of conflict. Conflict is one 
of my personal issues, I don’t like conflict much. You can elaborate good place 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
574 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
bad place specifically to have a conflict, much like the second day, I believe, 
the gentleman who was behind the car and the guy comes out and he stood 
his ground. That’s, of course, conflict speculating as opposed to the 
equanimity version of it, the benign attention and go, go ahead and conflict 
with me all you want. 
 
 
Do you get the idea on that one? Yeah, let’s do some other things. Again, this 
probably doesn’t apply to anyone in this room, but some people have a lot of 
baggage from their past that’s still tormenting them today, even though the 
moment’s long gone, the people are probably all gone and the chance of that 
happening again are zero. But still, it happens, so you can go through your 
memories and relive the unpleasant memories but you can have good 
memory, bad memory, good memory.  
 
 
So it starts taking the sting out of all the negative memories that have been 
wanting you, I mean not you of course, the people out there who aren’t as 
enlightened as you.  
 
 
Then we can get really interesting. Once you’ve cleared up all the things you 
think yes, I’m the Buddha. I’m Nirvana. I am the light and no more buttons 
left to push. Then you start doing good place bad place with everything you 
don’t like in life. That means, the people you disrespect, the people that 
annoy you, the ideas you think are wrong, the behaviors, maybe even anti-
social behaviors and things like that, and you challenge yourself to stay 
equanimious, to have a benign attention, maybe even a benign attention with 
an interaction with someone who is a complete…  
 
How do I put this? It rhymes with bowl, at least the second half does. So you 
get the idea how good place bad place can be framed, contained and 
constrained towards ever more intensive lead challenging things. But we 
haven’t done that here because that’s way beyond the scope of where you 
are at this point. Please do not be in a hurry to go there.  
 
You have plenty of space just within good place bad place, because you can 
intensify those emotions to place of joy, place of terror, place of love, for 
example. How many people here, over the last four days have had an intense 
emotion come up at some point during your practice? Put your hands up so 
everyone can see. That’s almost everyone in the room. The rest of you of 
course, we’ll look at that too. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

So imagine being able to get intense emotion consistently, it can be useful to 
have that emotional range. Imagine being able to have, as intense a negative 
experience as you had a positive one, but still be totally benignly attentive of 
it, in other words, be unaffected by it. Right? So there’s lots of scope within 
that already, so you can go wide by cleaning up all these little things and you 
can go deep by having more intense experience of things.  
 
So it gives you a huge amount of breath and choice and this is just the stuff 
we’ve talked about in five minutes. There’s many different things. Basically, 
anything where you have limitations in life is fair game for this. Again, let me 
emphasize a word of warning. Tomorrow is not the time to experiment with 
dealing with those things that really set you off. Whether it’s in one way or 
another. This is something you need to build mental muscle for, to be able to 
safely attend to it and expand the practice and so on. Thank you for that.  
 
Student: Thank you very much. 
 
Igor: 
Any other questions? 
 
Student: I was having a question about this course. As I understand it’s not exactly self-
hypnosis, but it’s not meditation. Does it have a name? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, ASH Method. 
 
Student: ASH Method, thank you. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome.  
 
 
This is one of the reason when we advertised it that we called it ‘beyond self 
hypnosis’, because it’s kind of a similar domain as self hypnosis but it kind of 
isn’t and calling it ‘beyond meditation’ wouldn’t make sense, especially for 
people who are interested in hypnosis. So, it’s related to all these things, but 
not particularly any one of them; hence, we just made up the new name, the 
ASH Method, which describes it quite accurately. 
 
 
Did you all experience some type of archetypal force emerging at some point, 
symbolic landscapes? I know you didn’t go to any symbolic landscapes at all in 
the last four days. Then the heroes journey, which is all about facing… a lot of 
people go to self improvement to build on their strengths, right?  
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual

I want to set a goal.  
I want to get richer.  
I want to be more charismatic.  
I want to be more influential.   
 
What they don’t realize is that very often those things will be side effects of 
facing their shadow, their fears, their dark side, their basement where 
they’ve locked stuff in. The heroes journey is all about the journey to the 
basement, facing those things, reclaiming whatever positive skills, ability or 
resources that have been trapped there and coming back with it.  
 
It’s not exclusively that, like you saw with the skill building exercise yesterday. 
You can build great skills without ever going near the basement. Sometimes 
to get those skills you have to go to the basement and what I want to give 
you is the whole range, so you can decide where on that range you’re not 
playing on any given day. Thank you for the question. 
 
Student: This should be easy for you to answer. I’m running into judgment, judging 
things and I mean it’s part of what stabilizes my world so it keeps me stuck 
there. Is that just mindfulness training…? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, it’s partly mindfulness and partly attitude, but what the hell is an 
attitude? We need to separate two concepts, which I think you may have 
bound together. There is a labeling program and there’s a judgment process. 
Labeling something is saying something like this is the red tree camping 
ground. There is no value judgment based there, but it’s a label. So if you’ve 
been to the scouting campground and I’ve been to the scouting campground 
and I say hey, remember the scouting camping ground and you go yes, I 
remember the scouting camping ground, try and say that when you’re drunk. 
 
 
A judgment is when you add a thought about its value. Essentially, it says its 
good or it’s bad. Most people think about non-judgment is about not saying 
it’s bad, but that’s not actually the case. It’s about not deciding whether it’s 
good or bad ahead of time. Allow me to present this to you in a number of 
ways.  
 
 
First, is called premature cognitive commitment.  
 
 
This is a classically researched phenomenon in literature feel free to check it 
out. It captures in the following example. You take a bunch of flies, and we all 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
577 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
don’t like flies so we’ll use them to torture for a while. We stick them in a big 
jar, cover the jar with some clear plastic and poke holes in it so they don’t die. 
You can even put sugar in the bottom so they don’t starve either.  
 
 
What you’ll notice is the first day their behavior is that they’ll buzz around, 
buzz around and bounce against the plastic on the top, they’ll bounce around 
and lap up some of the sugar, drink some of the water and they’ll fly around, 
crawl on the walls and that sort of stuff. After a little while, they figure out 
the confines of their bucket-land and they stop wasting energy and trying to 
fly out the top, because they can’t get out.  
 
 
When that happens, you can peel the lid off and those flies will fly around, 
they’ll eat their sugar cubes and they’ll suck up the water and they’ll fly 
around. They’ll fly around near the top and they won’t even attempt to leave 
the jar, which is now wide open. It’s because they have committed to an idea, 
a map of what the confines of the world are.  
 
 
We do this all the time. We jump to conclusions and commit to them ahead 
of time. Judging by your reaction, that’s where the judgment is coming from. 
Now, we can judge good conclusions and bad conclusions. My preference is 
to delay. I don’t know. I don’t know what the actual… I haven’t got enough 
facts to make a decision. It doesn’t mean I will never make a decision or a 
judgment call, no. It’s in the moment I usually don’t have enough information 
to decide what it actually means.  
 
Student: You almost never have that information. It’s never complete.  
 
Igor: 
Right, then it’s a question of, at what point do you do it just so you can have a 
practical life as well? The good news is, inside of your mentalizations it 
doesn’t matter, you don’t have to make any value judgment calls it’s 
unnecessary. It’s not required for you to succeed in that. So, a little story for 
you.  
 
 
An old man and his son are walking through a forest and a stallion comes 
running by. They catch it and go home. All the villagers come round and say 
oh, you’re so lucky you have a horse. That means you’re almost noble, a 
horse is expensive, great, lucky man. The old man goes, who knows. So the 
next day the son’s trying to break the horse in, he’s riding around, the horse 
throws him, he breaks his leg and everyone comes round and says oh, you 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
578 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
poor man your son has broken his leg, he can’t help in the family, you have to 
work all by yourself, you poor thing. He goes, who knows.  
 
 
A few weeks go by and the country’s at war as they do. Farmers of mass 
destruction or something, and so the army’s come by and they pick up all the 
young men in the area to come fight in the war. Everyone is terrified, sad and 
scared for their kids, but of course the young man with the broken leg is no 
good for them so he stays home. Everyone comes round and says oh, you’re 
so lucky you son gets to stay home. The old man says who knows.  
 
 
Does that help? Any other questions.  
 
Student: Thank you. I’d just like to add to that. I do quite a bit of long distance rowing 
and you can get quite sore as you’re doing it. I didn’t realize that it might 
have been mindfulness, it’s just kind of connecting with me now, someone 
had been telling me when you’re out running and if you feel some sort of 
pain somewhere, don’t just jump to the conclusion that that’s a pain and it’s 
a bad thing, you can actually focus on it for a moment. Think about it, decide 
what the actual feeling is, is it hot, cold or what is it?  
 
 
You come to find after doing that, that it leaves the body quick enough that 
you lose your focus on it and lose your attention. I found that very helpful.  
 
Igor: 
Absolutely and actually mindfulness practice, there’s a lot of research which 
we haven’t gone into here, because that’s not the purpose of this course. 
There’s a lot of research on how mindfulness practice, helps significantly 
diminish the experience of pain that people have. In the Pain Control course 
you’ll understand why.  
 
Any other comments?  
 
Student: Just a quick question. For someone who works with his imagination, this kind 
of lends itself to, is the question… is this the kind of therapy that deals with 
parts, like the inner child and all that…? 
 
Igor: 
Yes-yes-yes. 
 
Student: What I found is it gets overly complicated and sometimes it solidifies these 
modalities and I was wondering if you have anything, because we’re going 
into our imagination… 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
579 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Allow me to see if I understand your question correctly and correct me if I 
misunderstood it. Is the question that, because we’re going into an inner 
landscape and we’re calling out an archetype, a symbol of something, do we 
run the risk of creating a part that separates from our consciousness and 
therefore, can cause issues by being in conflict like that? 
 
Student: Right, and becomes overly complicated. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. The answer to that is, if you go looking for that then yes. It’s 
called a premature commitment. If you’re labeling it as something separate 
than yes. If you realize that it’s just a metaphor, just a symbol for yourself… 
even your unconscious mind is a symbol. This is you. You exist. There are 
different aspects of you that function different ways and optimized for 
different things, then that intention automatically colors the experience, 
right? 
 
 
You’re a screen writer are you not? So you’ve written many stories. Do you 
ever get consumed by your stories, in the sense that you suddenly wonder, 
maybe I’m this person now and you forget who you really are? 
 
Student: No. 
 
Igor: 
No. Why? Because you know it’s a story that you’re writing, so you get to 
enjoy it while you’re writing it and let it go afterwards and you can reflect 
over time and enjoy it again. It has its own individual entity in terms of its 
existence or story. The characters, you probably love some characters, hate 
some characters and are indifferent about others, right?  
 
 
But they only take a life of their own whilst you’re writing about them. When 
they have served their purposes they go back to where they were. So the 
thing that causes this fractioning of a personality is the fear that you’re 
fractioning your personality. Because then you’re labeling it as a fractured 
personality and that’s a dangerous label. It’s going back to what Hugh was 
talking about with the premature commitment, your committing to it being 
an entity of some sort and therefore, empowering it as such. 
 
 
It’s a self fulfilling prophecy in a more negative sense. If you’re concerned 
about that, remember the grounding practice you do at the end of the whole 
cycle is part of that and the integration beginning afterwards is to remind you 
this is you, this is my body, my mind, my emotional state and I can feel it all 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
580 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
and it’s all me. I can relax for a moment and breathe in while I enjoy that. It’s 
all still me. Do you get that? 
 
Student: Yes, I mean, I was referring to how in psychology… 
 
Igor: 
Totally. 
 
Student: Self help with the inner child… 
 
Igor: 
But what they’re doing is, the way they’re discussing it, they never mention 
the fact that this is a symbolic inner child. They’re saying it is an actual inner 
child. Maybe the psychologist realizes the difference because they spent 10 
years conceptualizing about it and so on, but I suspect many of them don’t 
actually remember that anymore they’ve forgotten. They’ve created an extra 
personality they call an inner child and then their clients are educated into 
treating it as an actual entity. 
 
 
You may have noticed, throughout this program I have tried to emphasize 
that this is a symbolic landscape. These are archetypal forces that have no 
particular shape inside of you they’re being expressed through these symbols. 
Now, there are some symbols we’ll come to after this session of goal setting, 
some symbols that are worth labeling so you reuse the value of them.  
 
 
Your place of relaxation, for example. You may have a good relationship with 
your healer and want to visit them often to get work done, but if you make 
the confusion that this is an actual entity it will become as such and can act as 
such to your detriment. If you realize it’s just you. You’re just using this as a 
convenient metaphor to allow an archetypal force that’s already present to 
express itself, the healing force in this sense, than it doesn’t matter.  
 
 
This is why we’ve always mentioned in terms of your ASH Method practice, 
the yoga attached to what figure should come. Call in a mentor, don’t call in 
the mentor. Do you understand the distinction? Sometimes it’s someone 
familiar, and Carl Jung did this, he had a process where all sources disagree, 
some say he had a psychotic break for a number of years, some say he did it 
on purpose to do similar things like we’re doing here.  
 
 
He essentially would go down to the end of his garden and converse with 
figures from hell and have a chat with them, and learn stuff. He said that was 
his most fruitful time in his life. In other words, the stuff he acquired in that 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
581 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
short period of time where he did this was the material he spent the rest of 
his lifetime unraveling.  
 
 
Even he realizes it’s just him, and that’s why he can approach it without fear, 
because it’s just a part of me, I’m going to learn from this as a learning 
experience and your intention is what creates these things. Allow me to give 
you one more piece of this puzzle and hopefully one of these things clicks 
correctly. 
 
 
There’s something called the ‘hidden observer’ affect in hypnosis and this is a 
really devilish little thing, because the question was, and this is where with 
researchers was, when someone is doing hypnotic pain control and this is 
before they had machines to figure out where the bloods flowing or what 
part of the brain is active, is the pain actually blocked from the pain and the 
experience of pain gone entirely? Or, is some part of the brain aware of the 
pain but just the conscious mind isn’t? 
 
 
So it was put in an experiment which was something along the lines of, you 
have someone with a hand in a bucket of ice, which when it gets very cold 
starts getting painful. Conscious people can hold it for a minute or two and 
then have to pull out because it’s too painful. It’s non-damaging pain, hence 
they use the ice bucket.  
 
 
Then they put people in trance, give them pain control suggestions and they 
can keep them there for hours, no big deal. So then the experimenter asks is 
there anyone in there who’s aware of the pain whilst he isn’t? What has he 
just done? He’s gone looking for it in exactly the same way than competent 
therapist created a split or multiple personality within a person. 
 
It’s because he went looking for it and then this is the uncertainty principle in 
action, not the physics but the psychological version, are you seeing a 
phenomenon because you went looking for it, and suggested it or because it’s 
already there? It’s a conundrum it’s very difficult to deal with. Luckily, we 
have some things like the FRMI scans that I can show whether or not their 
brain is actually perceiving pain whilst it’s going on. Sometimes I like to 
experiment with things like Naloxone which acts to block morphine receptors 
and so on. 
 
So the long and short of the answer is yes, and no, it depends. And what is it 
depending on again? It’s the intention. It’s on what the expectation of the

person is. If you expect yourself to fracture into 100 different parts that act 
independently and cause havoc, guess what? You will. If you expect it to just 
be a metaphor to symbolically allow things that are forces inside to express 
themselves in a useful way, then that’s all that will happen too.  
 
After all, what is a meta-a-for? Does that help?  
 
Student: Yes.  
 
Igor: 
Thank you. It’s a valuable question, especially if you’re more into the 
psychological literature. I think a lot of psychologists create these schemes of, 
this is exactly what it is I can prove it this way, but they’re just really good 
hypnotists without realizing it.  
 
Student: I had a general question about habits. I presume most people will want to 
habituate these practices in their life. I was wondering, do you think it’s 
better to replace the so-called bad habit that you’re continuing to do with a 
good habit or is it better to get rid of a bad habit all together? Could you just 
give some general advice? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. I’ll give you the conventional wisdom and then my answer. The 
conventional wisdom is that you replace a bad habit with a good habit. There 
is some good science behind that idea along the lines of, habits create 
networks inside your brain, like neuro networks that fire up and in the 
absence of somewhere for that to go it will just go to what it already knows. 
Therefore, people will default back to bad habits if there’s not a good habit 
present.  
 
 
My answer is this, who knows. Because there are plenty of examples of 
people just stopping a bad habit without replacing it with anything, so clearly 
that works too. Ultimately, if in doubt, find someone and ask them. When I 
say someone, I mean the representation of you that is that habit. Make 
sense? 
 
Student: Yes. Thanks 
 
Igor: 
Okay, one last question and then we’ll take a break.

Student: First, there was a pretty famous hypnotist named Almond. He had this, go as 
deep as you can and then open your eyes and then go twice as deep and so 
on.  
 
Igor: 
Fractionation, yes.  
 
Student:  This principle then of fractionation, like you’ve discussed before with 
bodybuilding and so on, could we use this, not just one minute and then half 
an hour again one minute, but we then want exercise to deepen the practice? 
 
Igor: 
For sure. Whilst I don’t necessarily want to start unpacking this whole 
question of what fractionation is, if you don’t know already, just because it’s 
not used for what we’re doing here. For those of you who are curious, 
consider the breathing that we did. Isn’t that a fractionation process? You do 
one and then you pause. You do it again and pause. You do it again.  
 
If you think about it, hasn’t this entire training been infraction process with 
one exercise, another exercise, another exercise, with everything building on 
top of each other? It’s part of the natural learning cycle that you take breaks 
in between things. The fractionation is built into the method with that little 
integration breathing cycle at the end, which is the bit that creates the gap 
for fractionation to take place.  
 
So that’s the technical answer to your question, in that it’s already built into it 
and if you want to experiment with finding additional methods of doing that, 
absolutely, it’s fantastic. A large proportion of that is already built into what 
you’ve been doing.  
 
Student: Another question is again, to get maximum effect; you’ve already mentioned 
a few times, time compression, like your psychotic client who uses two weeks 
of holidays in an hour or so. Could we do this too? Could you teach us? 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. I’ll give you an example. I’ve been experimenting with this. The 
only reason I haven’t taught it here is because I don’t know how to teach it 
reliably yet. Changing your perception of time to make it subjective so one 
minute feels like an hour or so is possible and it gets interesting if you do 
that, for example, and you open your eyes and watch a movie, you can see 
the frames ticking across. It’s very bizarre.

The problem with that is that I don’t currently know how to teach a group 
how to do that reliably and get enough experiences to know how to reach 
that. So, if you figure it out please tell me, I’d be delighted to know.  
 
 
In theory is it possible? Absolutely. How do you do it? Ask me in a year or two 
when I’ve had enough time to sit down and figure it out. That’s the only 
reason it hasn’t been built into this is because I don’t know how to do it 
reliably yet.  
 
Student:  Okay. 
 
Igor: 
Any other questions. All right guys. Let’s have a 10 minute break so we can 
finish early. I know people have flights today.

DVD 18 – Setting True Goals With The Beyond 
Self Hypnosis System & Using “Futurescope” 
 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
There are so many things I want to show you. It’s unreal, right? There are a 
couple of quick things I want to talk about in terms of the stuff you’ve already 
done, and there’s one more process I want to run you through, and then we’ll 
talk about the exam, have a break and then you can come back and we’ll do 
that. 
 
 
Invariable I’ll ask any more questions, you say no, the break happens and half 
an hour later I’m still answering questions. Here are a couple of things that 
will be of interest to the group.  
 
 
What can you use these different healing places for? I’ve given you a general 
method that you can use for pretty much anything. There’s only one thing we 
haven’t discussed yet, which is goals and stuff like that but that’s what right 
now is about. Let’s take the practice room. Anything you want to get better 
at, you can use the practice room. Here’s the general rule of thumb: 
 
 Put yourself into the context where you do this thing. 
 
 
If it’s a physical skill, that’s where I recommend you start because it’s easy to 
the changes occurring, rather than the mental skills. However, the mental 
skills are the same.  
 
 
Let’s take the most abstract mental skill – mathematics. Abstract, mental, 
there’s nothing you see. You see someone looking like this. Does anyone 
watch the TV show The Big Bang Theory? That’s kind of fun. One of my 
favorite episodes is physicists at work. This is physicists working furiously. 
There’s like a five-minute segment of that. It’s hysterical. I never laughed so 
hard at people doing nothing.  
 
 
All you do is you put yourself into the mental context of it. If you had more 
time, I would give you so many different examples that you would trip your 
head out, but let me give you some versions of this just to go far out there.

Some of you meditated in your room before you came here. What if you went 
to a landscape that’s perfect for meditation and you meditated within your 
mentalization? My goodness, isn’t that crazy? Now we’re getting into things 
like dream yoga and stuff like that. 
 
 
As long as you can put yourself in a landscape and as long as you can go 
through the process of actually doing the work, then you can bring in a 
mentor and if it’s a purely mental skill, the mentor has a magical capacity to 
read your mind. Do you know why? It’s you! 
 
 
So, don’t get constricted just because we did a physical thing. Oh squash, this 
is all well and good but I don’t want to do squash. I want to become a better 
writer. I want to become a better thinker. I want to be able to do better on 
exams. 
 
 
Every single one of them is identical. You go through the same process. Can 
you rehearse the actual skill? Can you bring in an entity that symbolizes a 
mentor that can guide you through that skill? Can you bring in someone who’s 
great at it? 
 
 
Chess is another one. You don’t watch chess just to watch people playing 
chess. You can step inside the mind and have their thoughts at the same time. 
Do you get the idea? Now let’s turn to the idea of healing. Pretty much 
anything you want to change about yourself is incorporated in the big thing of 
healing. 
 
 
We could spend a week just unpacking all the different ways you could use 
the healing processes, but let’s just have some thoughts around this. Let’s say 
you have a bad habit. How might you do that? Well, my default might be I’ll 
rock up, go into a landscape. I’m going to resolve this bad habit. Give me a 
bad habit I should have.  
 
 
Let’s say I’m a smoker. I’m not but let’s say I was. I rock up and say let’s go to 
a landscape where it’s going to be easy to quit smoking. Great, here I am. Oh, 
thank you unconscious – although you realize I don’t actually smoke, so I 
don’t have to go through that part of the process. Just bring it in there for 
safety’s sake.

So, in this rocky cave that’s on top of a mountain. It overlooks this very steep 
drop down to a valley and an ocean. There’s a river there. Very nice, thank 
you very much. Okay, now bring in a healer – a cave man, thank you very 
much. Mr. Caveman, I’m a smoker – I’m not really but this is what I would say 
if I was – I want to stop, so do your stuff. That might be enough. He might say 
no I’m sorry I can’t do it. There’s something missing.  
 
 
All right, what’s missing? Well, you want to stop but what about the part of 
you that wants to smoke? Great, bring him in. He comes in a smoking duck. 
Thank you very much. A cigarette out one end. 
 
 
Now healer, let’s work things out. Now he becomes a mediator. Why do you 
want to smoke that? Why do you want to quit smoking? Let’s make sure you 
keep what you want, you get what you want and everyone’s happy. 
 
 
Do you see where I’m going with this? Those of you who have therapeutic 
training of course see where this is going. Any therapeutic skill you’ve learned 
– whether it’s NLP, hypnotherapy or whatever paradigm that you use – can be 
used within the mentalization as a symbolic act of healing that will resolve the 
conflict. 
 
 
Hence, no matter what it is you want to change about yourself, the healing 
places can be adapted according to your own creativity to do that. Now if in 
doubt, what do you do? Ask yourself what should I do? I want to change 
something. I don’t know how to change it.  
 
 
Now take me to a place where I’ll get someone to counsel me on how to 
change this. Now I’m in a big prairie and there’s a herd of deer running 
around. I have no idea what the name for them is but they look pretty. Then 
let’s have someone come in, so I can discuss how to change these things 
because I have no idea how to do it. In comes a pygmy with a big spear. Nice. 
Then I have a discussion with him. 
 
 
Look, I’m trying to change these things. I have no idea how to use my 
mentalization to change it. Do you have any advice? Yes. Do you see where 
we’re going with this? Do not get limited to just the exercises you did. They 
are principles in action. It’s your mind, and your mind has an infinite capacity 
to create things. So, create those things that will help you make the 
transformations you want.

Now you have the core skills to do anything. Technically we don’t even need 
this session because you can create your own version of this session by 
bringing someone in and just saying look I’ve got this goal and I don’t know 
how to achieve it. Help me. Done. Essentially, you will have an experience of 
this, and we’ll take you through the fast-track version of it just so you can see 
that you don’t have to think about it too much and a lot of good stuff can 
happen. That was the first thing. 
 
 
The next thing is related to it. The question was in how many ways can you 
use the healing place? What can you use it for? Let me give you some 
inspiration to kind of build up this thing. 
 
 
Has anyone heard of Nikola Tesla? He was a bit of a genius. He did some 
pretty funky things. In fact he invented some machines that even today 
they’re only just figuring out how he did it. He was a wonderful man. 
 
 
He had the capacity. He had created a place inside his mind, kind of a 
laboratory, where he created the various machines he was tinkering with, 
whilst most people had to build the actual machine, start it running, come 
back a week later, take their instruments out and figure out where is the wear 
and tear, where is it not working right, fix, come back another week later and 
measure it again and so on.  
 
 
It was a tedious process because they had to make the stuff, measure the 
stuff, a lot of wasted material and a lot of time in building it. After a while, 
Nikola Tesla would do that and he’d make a mental machine. That was his 
kind of check.  
 
 
Then after a while he stopped bothering with the physical machine. It was too 
expensive and it took too much time. He just built it in his mind, left it running 
for a week, came back and checked it out. He had mental tools to measure it 
and by the time he perfected the mental machine and he was happy with it, 
he’d build the actual device and it would run exactly as his mind had 
predicted it would. 
 
 
He had an immense capacity for this. He grew up very poor. His mother 
played imagination games with him, rather than punishing him for his 
imagination, which was nice of her. Some claim that he had a neurological 
defect that actually allowed him to do this. I think they claim that more based 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
589 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
on the premise that they can’t understand how a person could possibly have 
such intense mentalizations.  
 
 
I think you and I understand that there is no requirement of a defect for him 
to have such a genius potential. So, what can you use this stuff for? Name me 
anything that is achievable and you can use your mentalization to assist and 
accelerate that process. 
 
 
Remember, if in doubt, ask yourself. Your unconscious might not know all the 
answers. If I asked my unconscious right now how do I genetically reengineer 
myself so that I have wings and I can fly to the moon, that is for want of a 
better word a really stupid question to ask myself, at least at this point of our 
history because it’s way beyond what’s possible. 
 
 
But then again, that’s my fish and you have your own dreams. Why have my 
fish in your dream? Maybe it will work for you. If it does, wow. You need to 
take an air of practicality to it. If your unconscious mind says just jump off a 
building and just really wish it and it will work out – even if you do that start 
off with very low buildings like 10 centimeters or so. 
 
 
This is co-consciousness. This is not a psychotic break we’re talking about 
here. Do you all have a sense that the tools that you have can be reconfigured 
in many different ways to achieve the kind of purposes you want, and if in 
doubt have a frank conversation with your unconscious in any symbolic form 
that you wish and see what comes out of that. 
 
 
May I talk a little bit about your experience? Is that okay? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Chintan comes up to me on the break. He did a healing last night on a 
particular pain, which then is associated with a fear about having a health 
issue arising. He resolved it in the healing place. That was fantastic and he was 
very happy with it. 
 
 
Then he went home, he went to sleep and the pain returned and suddenly the 
fear returned with it. He said oh my God this has all failed. I don’t know if this 
is working, what do I do? Quick help me, great guru. Of course he said all you 
must do is exactly what I say. Follow this list. Number one, get out your credit 
card.

The solution is exactly what you talked about. Any guesses what the solution 
was? Sitting with it is a part of it but would it be fair to say it was a relatively 
major breakthrough what you had? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, sitting with it doesn’t typically have that kind of big breakthrough, 
although it can do. What else could he have done? 
 
Student: Interacted with it. 
 
Igor: 
Interacted with what? 
 
Student: It. 
 
Igor: 
What is it? Very simply, go to a healing place. Bring in a healer. Explain your 
problem. I did this healing and it worked fine. I went home and I was terrified 
it wasn’t working. What did he say? That was not the problem. His conscious 
mind put his conscious fish in his unconscious dream, so no wonder it didn’t 
work. 
 
 
What’s the next question to ask? Oh, what is the problem? Let me show you. 
Pulling shit out. I apologize for my French but it was. Pulling it out and 
suddenly at the end of the whole process, how did you feel?  
 
 
Let’s have the microphone because I know the answer to this one and this is a 
very safe question for me to ask in public. So, what was the upshot of the 
whole experience? 
 
Student: So, basically once I got to know that it’s not the problem, I said what is the 
problem? Still right now I don’t know what the problem ever was. 
 
Igor: 
Which is fine. 
 
Student: But the feeling that I got was like something really evil or it was very 
uncomfortable at the beginning.  
 
Igor: 
Symbolically you can see the match-up, right? Carry on.

Student: I knew that basically I had to sit with it. I was there for at least a minute or so, 
which felt like longer, but basically as a result of that I still don’t know what 
the problem was, but basically I felt that the healer was moving like a black 
demon out of my body. It just started coming out and it just became so much 
bigger and then it transformed into like a black board, like a very big board. 
 
 
Then basically, I automatically felt like so relieved but it was still happening, so 
I interacted with the board and I was l like look I respect you for being there 
for some good thing but now I think I’ve learned my lesson whatever it is, but 
now it’s time for you to go. I had a very good interaction with it and it was 
kind of holding onto my finger with the last bit of string that was there, and 
then it just pulled the string away and it just flew. As soon as it flew away – 
I’m still shaking right now. 
 
Igor: 
Can you see the reaction of that? The only reason he didn’t have that 
yesterday is because he wasn’t asking the right question. It doesn’t matter if 
you ask the wrong question, by the way. Do you know why? It’s because as 
soon as you ask the wrong question and you don’t get the result that you 
want, you know exactly what the next question is. 
 
 
Bring someone in who know what the hell is going on. Look, I thought it was 
this. It clearly didn’t work. Tell me, what should I do? That’s essentially all that 
he did, isn’t it? That’s why we spent so much time getting the spontaneity 
aspect because let’s face it. His unconscious mind knows exactly what the 
problem is. Otherwise he couldn’t have had it. Something’s got to keep it 
going. 
 
Student: Yes, the best part is that you don’t need to know and understand what the 
actual problem is and you still feel like a release, right? 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Student: So, even though I still don’t know, the healer told me that the problem was 
not that but it was this. It didn’t say anything but it just changed it. 
Igor: 
It just said let’s get rid of it or let’s resolve it, right? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. I appreciate that.

Student: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Give him a round of applause. So, do you appreciate how with the same skills, 
the same tools with just minor variations you can create infinite realities that 
create infinite results for you? 
 
Create Your Future 
 
Igor: 
What I’d like to do now is share one more such tool, but really it’s just one 
more variation on exactly the same theme. I’d like to do this as a group, so 
you’ll do it individually. We’ll break it down into segments and just have quick 
experiences. 
 
 
As opposed to yesterday where we had really long drawn-out experiences and 
so on, this is going to be goal-setting practice with some twists and we’ll 
expand those twist sizes as we go along. I want you to have a full flavor of it 
now so that you can go home and spend as long as you need to actually do it 
with a full experience. 
 
 
To make sure that we have enough time before lunch to do that, let’s just 
basically pause our normal rituals in terms of the mentalization to get your 
focus. I think your focus is pretty much decent.  
 
 
The first time we’ll do the mindfulness practice just to build some attention, 
but after that we’ll just go relatively fast paced so that you get all the pieces 
together, and then you’ll have the whole experience as one unit.  
 
 
Even if that experience doesn’t work entirely as you would wish, you’ll know 
exactly what to do next, which is great I did all that, so what do I need to do 
next? This is just to give you more food for thought for what is possible.  
 
 
The territory I want to get into – we’ve got something around building skills. 
We’ve got something about changing as a person – whether it’s physical 
healing, emotional healing and so on.  
 
 
Of course I can make no medical claims about the physical healing in 
particular or the emotional healing, but at least it will enhance the chances of 
boosting your immune and so on.

The final thing we haven’t really addressed directly, although the same tools 
will work in the same sort of way, is how to achieve goals. The only reason I 
put this as a special category is because there’s a risk that if you follow 
traditional goal-setting methods, those goals will all exist within Bucket Land. 
 
 
If your mission is to escape from Bucket Land, then it would be very remiss of 
me to show you a method to achieve goals that keep you there. If you are 
very clear that this is a particular goal that you just want as it is, then it 
doesn’t matter where it is. If it’s in Bucket Land or not is irrelevant, so you 
may as well do that. 
 
 
But if you want to make sure your goal is not only to achieve the essence of 
whatever you get out of them but help you out of Bucket Land at the same 
time, this is a process that will be of value to you. Would you be interested in 
running through that sequence? 
 
 
Everyone put your pens and papers down. This is going to be a whirlwind tour 
of mentalizations. It’s very simple. What I want you to do is start with a 
mindful practice and build up a bit of mental attention, and then use that to 
go to some pleasant scenery just to get used to your mentalization again for 
today because we haven’t really done that much of it yet. 
 
 
As soon as you’ve done that for a few moments and you feel stable within a 
pleasant landscape, bring yourself back directly or as directly as you need to 
so that you don’t get all woozy because this is just the warm-up act. All right, 
off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m going to a different landscape now. I’m on a rocky cliff overlooking the 
ocean. There’s a path of green grass and my thoughts can carry either way 
with the wind, the sound of birds or out on the vast expanse of the sea, its 
endless variations, the limitless sky, the warmth of the sun overhead, the 
calming peace that I can find inside here and there’s a bird that’s coming and 
lands out on rock opposite me. 
 
 
And I can ask this bird questions and it can answer me. It can give me clues to 
guide me. So, I go to the bird and I say in this practice where do I go to go 
deeper? And the bird looks into the sky.

Igor: 
Remember, once you’ve had an experience of this landscape just until it’s 
satisfying, bring yourself back. This is just the warm-up act. You’ll be going 
back here more often. All right, we have most of you back now. That was 
straightforward. This is normal ASH Method practice that you’ve been doing 
for the last four or five days now. 
 
 
We’re working with goals. What I’d like you to do now is choose some simple 
goal, something you’d like to achieve in your life. You have two choices. You 
can go big or you can go small. Both have advantages and disadvantages. 
 
 
Going small has the advantage that you can probably test it more quickly and 
you’re more likely to succeed, which means you’ll get some confidence in the 
process.  
 
 
Going big has the advantage that you can totally blow your mind when it 
works, but it has the disadvantage that you don’t know if you can rely on the 
process yet. Within that range, find something that you think would be 
appropriate for you to work on in here. Choose a specific thing that you would 
like to achieve in your life, whether it’s a skill, more wealth, a relationship.  
 
 
Do you all have a goal in mind? Hands up. Excellent. If you have trouble 
finding something, just choose something that’s relatively pleasant that would 
be useful in your life that you genuinely want and is relatively small. It doesn’t 
have to be big if it’s easier to find something simple. 
 
1. So, that’s step one of goal-setting complete.  
 
 
Now, of course, there’s a lot more. I know people who spend a week on just 
how to choose a goal. I think that as human beings we have a pretty good 
idea of that sort of stuff, so I’ll let you do that for yourself.  
 
2. Step two is go back inside.  
 
 
Don’t worry about mindfulness practice. We’re going to surf the same stream. 
Go back to the last place that you were in. From there ask your unconscious 
mind to teleport you or take you to a place where you can plant a seed for 
your unconscious mind to achieve this goal. 
 
 
You’ll get into whatever your landscape is and once you’re there, all I want 
you to do is find some kind of device, something symbolic like a pool, a TV

screen or a big telescope. It doesn’t matter what – in other words, don’t 
choose it ahead of time, let it come to you – where you can look into the 
future and just watch yourself living a life where that goal has been achieved. 
 
 
That’s easy right? Now importantly, consciously you don’t want to construct 
the future. Just let it come to you as whatever you see, as long as in that 
future you have achieved the particular goal you had in mind. Again, just only 
take a minute or two. You’re only going to get a snapshot of it and then bring 
yourself right back because as exciting as this may be, this is not pay dirt yet.  
 
 
All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m in the forest. Great large trees around me in the winter, and there’s a pool 
of water nearby. It’s a reflecting pool. As I walk up, I can see my reflection, still 
when the water is still, and troubled when the water is troubled. 
 
 
And now the water is troubled and there’s a fish. I’m going to ask the fish 
what can I do with myself to bring me a better relationship in the future? I 
give the fish a coin and the fish dives down into the pool and the water is 
troubled, and I dive into the pool and it’s icy waters. 
 
 
And there at the bottom of the pool is darkness and there’s a sliver of light, 
and I see the fish there grown great and mighty, and in the fish’s mouth is a 
ring and I take the ring from the fish, and the light grows greater and reveals a 
door and I swim to the door. I open it and all the water drains in and I’m 
washed into a room, a great stone room. 
 
 
I see a future where I’m living in a better relationship. It’s out there in the 
distance and I watch that, learning, and now very quickly like a ghost I can 
come back retracing my steps all the way up through the water into the 
sunlight, into the cold but suddenly dry, and I’m going to take a while to sit 
with this and reflect on it. 
 
Igor: 
Most of you are back. Remember, we don’t need the full exit process right 
now because this is all part of the same experience. I’m just taking you 
through step by step. Easy so far? Hands up if it was easy. Hands up if you 
have a question. This is not the complete process. I’ll talk a little bit about 
what you’ve done so far and where we’re going to next.

Student: I have a quick question. What if the bits of the future are not what you want 
actually? 
 
Igor: 
Change your goal. 
 
Student: What if it carries unwanted consequences to it that you didn’t want? 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. In that case, stick with this process. You’re about to get an answer 
to that question. In fact that is exactly why we’re going to do what we’re 
about to do. 
 
Student: Just to clarify, Igor. Is it the same place we need to go back to each time? 
 
Igor: 
It’s up to you. I say yes but that would be the height of arrogance. That would 
be my colored fish. Remember that when you’ll be doing this at home, you’ll 
be doing this whole process in one go.  
 
 
I’m segmenting it so that we can discuss each element so that we’re all on the 
same page so to speak. It’s entirely up to you because you’ll get a chance to 
do this again when you get home. 
 
 
The practice you’ve done so far will be very brief. It’s basically the sum total of 
most goal setting processes you will see. They’ll have some type of 
intellectualization about what goals you should choose. There will be some 
kind of regime about clarifying that goal, like smart goals or well-formed 
outcomes or whatever. There are some formulas around that.  
 
 
Then you basically sit down and you think about a future memory to tell your 
unconscious mind please give me this goal. Thank you very much. I’d 
appreciate it. 
 
 
An extra step some people do is they chart out what steps do I need to do to 
get to that, and then step by step they do that. It’s a very conscious way of 
doing it. The more unconscious way – the meditative hypnosis sort of way – 
would be to just repeatedly rehearse that future memory in the hopes that it 
will come to life.  
 
 
There’s a problem with that of course, and Stephane just hit the nail on the 
head and the essence of it. What if there are consequences you don’t want?

What if this is a goal that keeps you in Bucket Land but really you want to be 
out of Bucket Land and you’re creating your own dilemmas? 
 
 
As soon as you create a conflict inside yourself, then your unconscious mind 
will do its best to resolve it by giving you part of it but still not, which is 
exactly what happened to Chintan during the healing he did yesterday. It 
clearly worked only it didn’t because he was focused on the wrong thing. 
 
 
It doesn’t invalidate what he did. It just means that he’s on a slightly wrong 
path because he’s accidentally over-controlled by asking the wrong question. 
The same is true in the sort of goals we’re setting. If you’re in Bucket Land, all 
your questions will be about Bucket Land, so how the heck do you get out? Do 
you see the dilemma? 
 
 
So, if you did nothing but this, for simple goals just mentalize the future 
memory of it and then repeat that over a period of time. The unconscious has 
a tendency to connect the gaps unless there’s something called a dirty goal 
where there’s a conflict of some sort, in which case either, nothing happens 
or things get worse just because the unconscious mind says no, you’re missing 
the point. 
 
 
So, how do you find the point if you’ve missed it? Would that be of interest to 
you? So far it’s been easy. Remember, the process we’re doing right now – 
you don’t always have to do it this way. What you’ve done up to this point can 
be enough for many things.  
 
 
This is stuff to basically fix what goes wrong. If every other goal-setting 
method goes wrong, what we’re about to do will fix it in much the same way 
as Chintan fixed the healing process he did yesterday? And thank you for 
being a nice symbol to the group for improved healing. 
 
 The first step is you’ve got to figure out where you went wrong. 
 
 
What did Chintan do in his healing? He brought in a healer and said this is the 
problem, help. Stephane just had the same thing. Look, I saw the future and I 
kind of want it and I kind of don’t – conflict. How much energy can towards 
allowing him to take the steps to do that when he’s conflicted like that? Not a 
huge amount.

So, I’d like you to go to your place of goal-setting, your place of future 
memories. It can be the same place or you can go to a different place. I don’t 
care. Just get a peek at that future just to remind you of what you’re doing. 
Just a peek, literally a second. 
 
 
Then call in some kind of mentor and discuss what you have watched. This is 
what I like. This is what I don’t like. I’m not sure about this stuff here. It may 
all be positive. It may be a mixed bag. It may be all positive and there’s a 
sense of I’m not entirely sure but there’s something missing and I don’t know 
what it is. 
 
 
Discuss it with them. See what they say back. You could take 20 minutes or 
half an hour just doing this step alone, depending on how big the goal is and 
how much is involved in it and so on. 
 
 
 
For the moment, I’d like you to spend no more than a minute having a small 
discussion to experience what I’m talking about so that in due course you can 
spend as long as you need doing that. In this way, you can get through the 
whole method without running out of time. Then you can go home and redo 
it at your leisure and make sure each step is complete, and rest assured I’ll 
write it out for you in a moment. Do you all understand the exercise? 
 
 
Get your landscape as quickly as possible. Just peek at the future for a second 
to reset the scene. Call in a mentor and discuss it, and in particular ask your 
mentor have I missed anything? Is there any question I should be asking? 
Should I be considering something that I haven’t considered yet? 
 
 
If you’d done this yesterday of course you would have found the issue more 
quickly, correct? Do you understand what I’m asking you to do? Again, spend 
just a minute or two, very brief. Get a flavor of it and come on back. This is 
something we’ll need to discuss and then we’ll go to the next level because 
I’m going to blow your minds – or rather your mind will blow your own mind 
for you shortly. All right, off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: So, I’ve returned to the scene. In an instant I’m taking to the room below the 
pool that looks out a window into the light where I can see myself in the 
future living the life I want.

I’m older in a black jacket and I’m with a woman with black and grey hair but I 
can’t see her face, so she turns around for me and it’s a skull face and I call on 
the fish. It swims to me in the air. It’s grown smaller and it has a crown. I say 
fish, help me understand what this means. What lesson do I need to learn? 
And the fish says you need to make peace with death. And I’m sitting on a 
bench and there are birds, and we’re feeding the birds and our children are 
grown. It’s time to find new ways to be quiet. 
 
Igor: 
All right, start wrapping up what you’re doing and slowly bring yourselves 
back. 
 
Student: I’m taking that in. 
 
Igor: 
Again, you don’t need the full exit procedure to come back because you’re 
going to go back again and do some more of this work, so it’s just enough that 
you can understand me with your eyes open. 
 
 
Overall was that easy? Did anything interesting happen whilst you were in 
there? Did you get surprised or have some interesting insights? We’ll discuss 
all those at the end when we can talk about the whole thing in general. Are 
there any questions on what we’ve covered so far? 
 
 
I appreciate that having more time to have a lengthy discussion with your 
mentor about this stuff will be of value to you, but for now we’re keeping it 
short so that all the segments fit together nice and smoothly and you don’t 
have too much standing in between so you forget the steps. 
 
 
Is everyone clear so far? No issues? Good. Excellent. So, you’ve chosen the 
goal. You’ve had a taste of the future by checking out the future or the future 
memory of having succeeded with the goal. You’ve now had a chat with your 
mentor and hopefully you’ve discussed some of the flaws within what your 
plan was originally as well. So, you’ve said I’ll go for it and just consider these 
things you may not have thought about before.  
 
 
Hopefully you addressed for example some of those negative consequences 
that you mentioned earlier. You’ll need more time for them all. I understand. 
For now we’re just playing with the concepts to get a feel for this. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is once again enter the stage. Pick things up 
where you left off. Maybe have a slight discussion with your mentor to pick up 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
600 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
where you left off, but please don’t take too long, just enough to get a sense 
of where you were when you left off. 
 
 
Once you have done that, go back to your future device and check your future 
memory out again and notice what changes have happened as a result of your 
conversation with your mentor.  
 
 
Note I’m not asking you to change your future picture. That’s a conscious 
choice. I’m asking you what spontaneous changes have occurred in that 
future memory as a result of the realizations you’ve had with the discussion 
you’ve had with your mentor.  
 
 
I’ll give you a little bit longer but please don’t take too long. Just have a little 
bit of a chat with your mentor to kind of get a sense of the conversation you 
had a moment ago, and then recheck your future memory to see what things 
have changed.  
 
 
Once you get a sense that something is a little different, come right back again 
because we’re not quite at the mind blowing stage yet. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m returning to the room with my mentor and I’m asking him what this 
means, and he’s giving me some advice about how to handle the future and 
what to expect, and I thank my mentor. I ask one other question and he says 
to go to the window, so I go to the window and I look outside at the couple 
sitting on the bench in the grass, and they’re holding hands and there are 
some other changes. 
 
Igor: 
Start wrapping it up wherever you’re at and bring yourselves back into the 
room. Do we have most of you back? How was that? Was that interesting? 
Rest assured when we finish the whole process, I will invite all of you to share 
your stories as much as you want to of course. Again, right now I just want to 
keep it all together. Hands up if your second review of the future memory was 
different in some qualitative way from the first one. Excellent. That’s really all 
we’ve done here. 
 
 
If you do nothing other than what we’ve done so far, your goal-setting 
practices should be significantly better and more reliable than 90% of the 
goal-setting methods out there.  

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
601 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Let me explain why. Most goal-setting methods are purely conscious goal-
setting methods – I want this and I’ll have it no matter what. The problem is 
when you get it, the no matter what bit is usually not quite as good as you 
thought it was going to be. 
 
 
Has anyone here ever really wanted something, achieved it and when they 
got it, it was like oh man? That’s because something was missing that you just 
did here. The thing that was missing was an unconscious check, checking with 
the unconscious mind, which knows a lot more about your totality of your life 
than your rather limited perception that the conscious mind can handle. 
 
 
Remember, your conscious mind is in Bucket Land and your unconscious is 
not. So, the unconscious check makes sure there are no conflicts. It points out 
things that could be problematic that you haven’t considered, and it helps you 
resolve those conflicts before you actually invest any energy into actually 
making them happen in your life. 
 
 
So, if you do nothing but this and kind of roughly regularly review the same 
future memory that you’ve just been looking at, the chance of reaching that 
goal will be significantly higher and the chance of actually enjoying that goal 
when you get it will also be significantly higher.  
 
 
However, you might still be in Bucket Land and we do don’t want that, do we? 
Or do we? So, shall we add something that will begin the process of mind 
blowingness? 
 
 
Now that you’ve done all this, what I’d like you to do is go back inside. Go 
back to your mentor and the discussion you’ve had and the future memory 
you saw and so on.  
 
 
This time ask your mentor to take you somewhere where you can look into 
another future viewing device where you will see a totally different future, 
which is at least as good as if not better than the one you thought of. 
 
 
In other words, the essence of what made you interested in that goal is 
preserved but in an unexpected way, in a way you’d never think of choosing 
as a goal. I want you to review that future and see if you enjoy it. See if you 
actually like that.

When you’ve had a moment of it – again please don’t take too long for time’s 
sake – but when you have a sense of oh this is very different, this is very 
novel, come back and discuss it with your mentor. Then come back into this 
room so that we can discuss it as a group. 
 
 
Do you all understand the exercise? You will return to the point you left at, 
ask your mentor to take you to a different place with a different future 
viewing device.  
 
 
You will see a different future memory, which is at least as good as if not most 
probably better than the one you chose. Review enough of it to get a sense of 
that. Discuss it with your mentor and then come right back here again 
because we’re not finished yet.  
 
 
It’s the same mentor but a different location, unless of course you decide this 
location is appropriate for you. It knows better than I do. You will ask your 
mentor to take you wherever you need to go to see a different future, which 
is at least as good as the one that you chose for yourself, if not better.  
Student Demo 
 
Student: All right, I’m returning to the scene. I’m there and I’m going to discuss with 
my mentor, and this is the picture I have seen and he tells me something of 
what it means.  
 
 
And then he says he has another place to see, another scene, so I follow him 
and we go there. It’s a door and we open the door and step out onto grass 
outside a house. And there’s a garden, a garden path, and I start on it and I’m 
somewhere else in a garden surrounded by flowers, pink and yellow and 
some little blue and someone’s there I can see. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, once you’ve had a brief view of that alternative future, have a 
brief discussion with your mentor and come back. Don’t do a complete 
version of the process yet. 
 
Student: And I ask my mentor what he means, and he gives me some clue and now I’ll 
come back.

Igor: 
All right, hands up if you were surprised by what you saw. Hands up please. 
Fantastic. This is wonderful to see. Now I realize some of you are a little 
rushed. Did anyone feel a little rushed? It’s okay.  
 
 
I apologize ahead of time. It’s just that we could spend the whole day just 
meticulously going through each step of this and then we’d run out of day. 
We’ll talk more about how to do this when you do it at home in your own 
time when you get back. 
 
 
Right now we’re building the process so that it’s there for you when you need 
it. So, what does it mean when you’re surprised by your own future vision of 
achieving something? 
 
 
First of all, that future memory you had – that alternative future that 
surprised you – did you enjoy it? Was it pleasant? Was it something desirable 
for you? Put your hands up.  
 
 
The reason for that is because this goal is outside of Bucket Land. That’s why 
you’re surprised by it. You could not conceive of goals like this inside of 
bucket land, and in order to achieve goals like this something has to happen, 
which we will address shortly. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now is once again enter your landscape wherever you 
left off. Thank your mentor for all the wonderful work he’s done so far. Then 
say wait Mr. or Mrs. Mentor, please take me to once again another location – 
unless of course this one is the appropriate one – where I can have another 
device – unless of course this one is the appropriate one – where I will see an 
alternative version of the future which is different from the other two and at 
least as good as if not better than both of those. 
 
 
 
Then come on back, discuss it with your mentor briefly because you have 
much more to do, and then come back here. I realize the temptation is to 
make this long because your mind is on the point of blowing at this point. 
Does anyone feel that happening right now? Is it like something’s going on 
here? 
 
 
Please don’t spend too long. You’ll have lots of time to explore this 
afterwards. Right now I want the whole process to sit together for you. So, it’s 
a repetition of the previous one, only there’s going to be an alternative future 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
604 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
number two, and it will be at least as good as if not better than the previous 
two. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m in the space where I left and I call my mentor to me, and I start to ask 
questions about what this means and he gives me an answer, and I say thank 
you. Now I ask for a third vision different than the other two, and I’m 
somewhere different. 
 
 
I’m in a castle made of ice and I look ahead and the fish is pointing me down a 
hallway to a room, and I’m going to observe what is there, and now I’m going 
to ask my mentor what this means. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, a brief glimpse of that future, a brief discussion and then just 
open your eyes and come back here for the next step. 
 
Student: I’m coming back quickly but with integration. 
 
Igor: 
Look directly at me because I’m not sure if you’re actually mentalizing or if 
you’re actually back. I appreciate you’re hovering a little bit because you’re 
hovering on that balance point.  
 
 
Let me ask everyone who was surprised by that second future memory? 
Hands up. Oh, that’s fantastic. For whom was that second alternative even 
better than the previous ones? It gets better and better. Do you want to know 
what the next step is? Do it again a third time. Remember, that the future 
memory you’ll see this time, the alternative you’re asking for is at least as 
good as if not better than all the previous ones. Off you go. 
Student Demo 
 
Student: I go to visit the mentor, discussing briefly what each vision meant, and now 
I’m going to give him a coin and say thank you and I’ll ask for another vision 
and in a new place. I’m observing the scene and I ask my mentor what this 
means and there’s an answer coming to my mind as a gift from my mentor 
and asking to reveal all of the lessons so far, respectfully. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, just a brief glimpse of that future, a brief discussion with your 
mentor and then come on back. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
605 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
Student: And now I’m coming back, letting the scene be as I return to this space and 
place.  
 
Igor: 
Look at the front so that I know you’re actually back. Who’s having some 
pretty rock and roll futures coming out? Excellent. I love this. Are you enjoying 
this process?  
 
 
So, what’s the next step? You’ve now got three examples of alternative 
futures, most of which will probably be outside of Bucket Land. You have one 
example of a future you chose for yourself consciously, which may or may not 
be as interesting anymore now that you have these alternatives. 
 
 
What I’d like you to do now are two things. Go back inside and with your 
mentor, I’d for you to discuss one simple topic. What is the theme that runs 
through all these future memories? The theme I particularly mean here is how 
are you being as a person, as a human being? That means not what do you 
have or what are you getting? It does not mean what are you doing or how 
are you behaving?  
 
 
What I mean is how are you being as a person? Do you understand the 
distinction I’m asking for? Once you’ve discussed this a little bit with your 
mentor enough to get a little sense of what it is – and I realize it may take a 
longer discussion to really flesh it out. I just want a hint of that for now so that 
we can do the exercise.  
 
 
What I’d like for you to do is once again look at your future projection device 
and see a future where the details are almost irrelevant. You can quite make 
out the details but what is very clear is you being this way. So, it’s irrelevant 
which of the four alternatives – or maybe it’s other alternatives you haven’t 
even considered yet – is going on. What is in that future? The only thing that 
you’re focusing on is how you are being, which is of course is what you just 
discussed with your mentor. 
 
 
Do you understand the question I’m asking you to engage in? Again, there are 
a couple more steps on top of this, so don’t take too long with it. Just 
experience that and then come on back and we’ll add a few more layers, and 
then we’ll discuss the whole method. Off you go.

Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m returning to the reflecting pool in the forest to have a discussion with my 
mentor and I thank him for his lessons. I put a coin in the pool and I ask him to 
review the theme of the scenes and ask how am I being in each of these 
scenes? And he is giving me answers and I’m returning with those lessons 
now. 
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting? Everyone’s getting very calm and saying oh yeah, I’m 
having deep spiritual thoughts about the future. Who’s finding your mind kind 
of going to all kinds of interesting places? Good. Excellent. 
 
 
The final step – and then we’ll discuss it all as a complete package – is again 
two things. The first thing is I’d like for you to invite into your landscape now a 
symbol, a figure, an assistant to represent something.  
 
 
Let me explain it to you this way. How many of you in this room are breathers 
– in other words you breathe pretty regularly? One of two of you are lying to 
me right now. Do you have to remind yourself to keep breathing on a daily 
basis? Do you have to keep focused on that breathing so that you keep doing 
it? 
 
 
What about a heartbeat? Does anyone here have a beating heart? Does 
anyone have to remind themselves to keep it beating or does it just keep 
going? There are mechanisms inside of our mind, our body and so on that 
automate stuff. In fact the more important the stuff that’s automated is the 
more resources are devoted to it.  
 
 
In other words, if your breathing ever had a problem, more and more 
attention would suddenly go onto it to fix that and it would happen very 
quickly because it’s very important.  
 
 
What I’d like you to do is invite a symbolic figure to appear in your landscape 
who will take responsibility for you to achieve any of those goals that you’ve 
been reviewing or something better, which will allow you to be the way you 
just reviewed and had a future memory of. So, invite some symbolic figure to 
come in who will take responsibility to do that just as you have some aspect 
of your mind running your heartbeat and your breathing and other things. 
 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
607 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Once that figure arrives, you go through the whole respect ritual. Greet them 
and say hi and check that you and that symbolic figure are on the same page 
of how you’ll be being and so on. Make sure they’re happy to take on the 
responsibility so that you can do other things, and that they’ll remind you 
from time to time if you need to go down one path or another. 
 
 
Then, of course, go through the customary exchanging of gifts. Thank them 
and then finally just before coming out, ask yourself the following question. 
What is the smallest thing that you can do in the direction of any of those 
goals? I mean something you can do right now, just the smallest tiniest little 
thing. 
 
 
It could be as simple as looking up a telephone number. Not making the 
phone call but just looking up the number. It could be as simple as putting an 
hour aside in your diary where you will do more of this sort of process. It 
doesn’t really matter to me. 
 
 
You’ll have to discover that inside when you go there, but what is the smallest 
tiniest action that you can take in the practical real world – outside world not 
real world as opposed to this real world – that will take you in the direction of 
any of those goals, with that overall goal of being-ness? Do you understand 
what I’m asking you to do? 
 
 
So, on the one side you’re going to have an assistant to whom you can 
delegate the sense of this future. We’ll call them the guardian of your future, 
but you can call them anything you want. I’m just using that label so that 
we’re having the same thing. 
 
 
You’ll have an interaction to make sure that they take responsibility for your 
future turning out this way, and then you will decide upon some small 
conscious step, some little action that will take you in the direction of being 
this person that you’ve just been considering. 
 
 
It shouldn’t take you very long, so whenever you’re ready go inside and do 
that, and then come right back out again using your full exit ritual this time, 
the full exit closing process.

Student Demo 
 
Student: I’m returning to the place where I’m meeting my mentor and I greet and 
respect, and we discuss the meaning of these scenes or alternatives and any 
other futures that I’ve not considered that may be better, and the way that 
I’m being or the theme that runs through them. 
 
 
And now we’re going to summon an assistant that will take responsibility to 
help me take the steps to achieve that most attractive or best future, and 
there’s an assistant and I ask, what is one small step I can take to move 
toward this future? And now I’m going to integrate that. 
 
Session Debrief 
 
Igor: 
All right, who enjoyed that? Hands up please. This is the interactive portion, 
so feel free to stand up and share away or if you have questions to ask, please 
do and then we’ll talk about the concept behind all of this before the lunch 
break. 
 
Student: I have a question. The music they were playing outside – did you choose that?  
 
Igor: 
Of course I did. I control everything!  
 
Student: Free Bird was very, very appropriate because it gave me a lot more freedom 
to go to these different places. My personal place I wanted to go to had so 
many negative things and it was not a place I was happy with when I was told 
by my mentor, but when I asked for the others I got better and better and 
better, including the things that I didn’t want to lose. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here a second. Did anyone else have that tendency that 
each time you asked for an alternative future, it started getting more exciting, 
more interesting and more attractive to you? Excellent. Carry on. 
 
Student: And then when we got to the guardian of the future when you were just 
telling us, I knew immediately it was the owl that came to me beforehand. 
 
Igor: 
Awesome. Excellent. 
 
Student: That was my spirit guide, if you like.

Igor: 
I like that. That’s awesome. 
 
Student: It was great. 
 
Igor: 
How do you feel about that? Good? 
 
Student: Very, very happy. I can still feel the feather on me. 
 
Igor: 
Good. That’s a nice signal that the unconscious is still looking after the whole 
thing, right? 
 
Student: It’s there to remind me. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Student: And keep going with it, so it felt great. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you for that. 
 
Student: I kind of have a list of things here. So, when the process started I was not very 
– it was not really working. It just kind of picked up as we went. One of the 
things that I acknowledged is that when I was asking a question like okay let’s 
go and visit a different place, kind of like that popped up before I finished the 
sentence. 
 
Igor: 
So, what you discovered is the power of intention. After all this is just your 
mind and notice how you’re starting to link intention to action more and 
more closely, so you don’t even have to complete the thought or the question 
for the essence of the question. It already knows and you just go straight 
there. 
 
 
In time you’ll be able to do a lot of this stuff much more quickly because you 
won’t need the words. Words are stabilizers, and just like stabilizers on a bike, 
they help immensely in the beginning but once you get to a certain speed, 
they hold you back.  
 
Student: Of course just because we were talking about the fractionation earlier, it just 
got better with every iteration of it. It was funny because like he said about 
the music, when we got to the point of how to be, I was asking that question

and all the sudden I just head Born to Be Wild. It was just right on cue. It was 
just perfect. 
 
Igor: 
You have no idea how much effort I went through to do that. 
 
Student: One very important aspect is that as we got to the steps from an NLP side I 
was dissociated, but with the last step I was associated. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: I was just there. It was not like I was seeing it from the outside but I was in the 
end. Of course I’m sure everyone had the same experience that the last step 
had nothing to do with the first step. In terms of what I set my goal, the initial 
first thing, and then the last thing it was just like complete blown out. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. This is exactly why we’re doing this. We’re trying to get you to go 
beyond your goals because your goals are keeping you in Bucket Land. There’s 
nothing wrong with those goals.  
 
 
Some of them are very useful, but it’s only by going beyond those goals to the 
true goal – in other words the essence behind that goal – that’s what gets you 
out of Bucket Land. 
 
 
I’ll give you a quick example just to make it really easy to understand. Let’s say 
a guy wants a Ferrari and he’s just so excited about having a Ferrari. Does he 
really want a Ferrari, or does he want to be the kind of person that has a 
Ferrari? Do you understand the difference? 
 
 
When he’s driving down the road in his Ferrari, he feels proud and he feels 
great and he’s like this is it, I’m driving the Ferrari. What he’s really doing is 
he’s getting to enjoy being that version of himself. Does he need a Ferrari for 
that? He thinks he does but he doesn’t.  
 
 
It doesn’t invalidate the actual car but really the true goal is so much greater, 
which means he has many different ways of having that. What if he can have 
that in a different car? What if it’s not a Ferrari but it’s a Maserati? Oh no, my 
goal failed. Do you get the idea? So, how do you stay true to your goals but 
still going beyond them and getting out of Bucket Land at the same time? Do 
you have some more?

Student: Yes, just one last thing. In the very end we have this guard that will be there 
to help achieve the goal, I kind of got this answer that put me a little off 
because I said okay so you’ll be there to help me achieve that, and he was like 
I’ll do all I can and I was not very happy with that answer because it wasn’t 
giving me a lot of confidence. 
 
Igor: 
For sure. 
 
Student: And confidence was the easiest to start with. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just pause you here for a moment. I realize this is a time constraint 
here but if time was of no essence in terms of doing the process, what do you 
think might be a useful way to resolve that issue? 
 
Student: I don’t know. 
 
Igor: 
Have a chat. What do you mean you’ll do all you can? What’s missing? What 
do you need in order to be able to say absolutely I will make this happen 
come hell or high water? And if he doesn’t know, then bring in a healer and 
say my guard needs fixing. Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
Student: Well, what I did is I asked the first mentor to help this guy do that. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Student: So, it was like okay we’ll work on it. We’ll do it. 
 
Igor: 
And you have to of course check your course. Excellent. 
 
Student: Yes, still the confidence issue, the trust issue is like is this working, is this not 
working? 
 
Igor: 
Of course. You see, part of the issue is you’re running on my timetable and 
not yours right now. Before you get to the whole goal-setting process, you 
may want to still polish up a lot of other bits and pieces you’ve been working 
with. 
 
 
So, I want to present it to you so that you can take it home so that you can 
have a sense of what else you can do with it. I fully appreciate that some of 
you will need to go and polish some of the basics more before going back to 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
612 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
something like this, but at least you’ll know the potential this has for you and 
you can get a sense of that, right?  
 
 
That’s the most important thing and why all these steps are here to get you 
beyond your own goals and into that sense of what’s behind every goal that 
every human being ever wants? He wants to feel a certain way. He wants to 
be a certain way.  
 
 
I’m hungry and I don’t want to feel hungry, so I’ll get some food. That’s a 
really basic goal. I’m starving and I don’t want to die, so I’ll get some food. 
That’s another basic goal. Then they elaborate and elaborate, and when you 
take care of food it’s probably sex. If you take care of sex, then it’s something 
else. 
 
 
Eventually you start taking care of the real basic needs and you start having 
some intermediate needs and so on, and different people have different types 
of hierarchies like the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and so on, but that’s really 
not important for our purposes.  
 
 
What is important is that you create a context where your mind just 
automatically fills in all the blanks in between.  
 
 
There’s another comment I want to make, but I’m hoping that someone will 
actually bring up this issue and then I’ll speak to it. If not, I’ll actually address 
it myself. Go ahead. 
 
Student: Mine had a progressive logical progression side to it. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And it started out with of course me deciding that I wanted to be the kind of 
person – well, first of all back to this weight thing. I’ll be quick. I’ll be fast in 
my progression but I used to do Bikram yoga because I was having a lot of 
health issues and I stopped about two months ago, and of course it me license 
to eat everything I want and any amount, and of course the weight starts to 
come on, so that was my first goal. 
 
 
I hate Bikram yoga. It’s so hard but I go just because it’s so good. So, I wanted 
to be the kind of person that could make progress in and go back. So, one of 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
613 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
the things my unconscious told me was that if I paid for a whole year, then it 
started to make sense – how much would I save and that kind of thing. 
 
 
So, then in the next one I instead went to get my karate black belt that I never 
did because of my knees. In that one, my knees were fine and the muscles 
build around it, so I didn’t need to have that problem.  
 
 
Then the other one – and they weren’t compelling they were okay, but then 
the other one was so surprising. I refused to go very far out because I have a 
little puppy that’s five years old and I didn’t want to go too far, so I found 
myself and I kind of got emotional because I started a book about a while 
back. 
 
 
I have a coach and the goal was to finish this year but I stopped, and I found 
out that the reason why I stopped is because it wasn’t congruent to have all 
these physical issues and speak on this subject matter and be real and with 
integrity. 
 
 
So, I figured oh well if I clean all this up, then I could encourage people and be 
the example and all those things, and be congruent in the book so that I could 
make a difference, but also what was so nice in the end was that I love Tinker 
Bell and for some reason the two guardians – if I may use that word – were 
Tinker Bell and a dwarf.  
 
 
I don’t know what the logic was there but one it made sense. The dwarf 
cleaned up the weeds and watered the plants and watered the seeds, so to 
speak, and then Tinker just sort of tinkered around and made sure everything 
is done, and that was a nice little gift. 
 
Igor: 
That’s awesome. 
 
Student: And what I’m going to do now as soon as I get out is Google the cost of Bikram 
yoga.  
 
Igor: 
That’s awesome. Congratulations. Well done.  
 
Student: An update from the dark… I finally realized that I’m not a person that 
visualizes, that I actually sense things. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent.

Student: What I did was I sensed that I had a mentor who was my former boss actually 
who gave me the advice for what I wanted and my second mentor was female 
and they both gave me two different futures actually. One was work-wise and 
the other one was in this sort of scene – hypnotism. 
 
 
All three futures were great. If I got them, you’re looking at one happy person. 
When I finally got the guardian, it was actually a little dragon. I sensed a 
cartoon dragon from some kid’s program who said you’re fine.  
 
 
I actually gave both guardians – the boss one a flower, the woman a book, 
and first of all I gave the dragon a piece of sugar that he wanted, and then 
afterwards I gave him a flower. He agreed that he would look after all my 
problems that I don’t have to worry about it, and I said thank you very much 
because I’m not all that great at looking after that. 
 
 
I then continued by asking the small step, and the small step is the fact that 
tomorrow I have a meeting here with a company that’s going to try to sell me 
a low deal to go to South Africa and I’m going for the higher deal. That was it. 
Thank you very much for your attention. 
 
Igor: 
Congratulations. Thank you very much. 
 
Student: It was quite fun, this exercise, and it worked fine for me until the third future 
and then something popped up. I thought wow I was really happy and then 
suddenly my judgmental part appeared and said well that’s never ever going 
to happen. Even though I tried to go back inside, it couldn’t. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. Thank you. I’ve been waiting for you to say that. So, what’s going on 
here? Of course in some respects it may just be that we’re rushing the process 
and you just have to build more trust with your unconscious and so on. That’s 
part of it f course. 
 
 
If you recall, I believe on the first day we talked about this particular student a 
few times who went through the Beta program and we did the exact same 
process actually. At the end of it he was glowing. He was just so happy 
because each future was better than the last, and he could be delighted in all 
of them and they could all happen at the same time or not. It was just 
fantastic. He was just beside himself.

When he came back actually his version of that was he wasn’t too sure of 
what the next step would be. For him I think it was to go upstairs and take a 
shower, which had really nothing to do with the future but it made sense to 
him in his mind just fine. I had a back of mind an alert that maybe something’s 
going on here. 
 
 
Sure enough a week goes by and there’s nothing. Two weeks go by and 
there’s nothing. A month goes by and nothing, except of course TV, which is 
very important.  
 
 
He’s carrying on his mentalizations, so he’s getting very, very good at this stuff 
but nothing’s happening. He can’t get off the sofa to get anything done but his 
mental practice is great, so he’s getting very worried. He’s just having these 
wonderful experiences that mean actually nothing and my family’s messed up 
and it’s not good. This is why I appreciate what we did earlier on. It’s the same 
issue here. 
 
 
Think about the essence of what we’ve done here. How will you be when 
you’re out of Bucket Land, which is essentially an indirect way of asking that 
question – how will you be when you have all these wonderful things as a 
matter of course? 
 
 
What needs to happen before he can be that way? He has to change. He has 
to be different. Most people think about I have to do different but actually 
you have to be different to make doing different easy. Does that make sense? 
 
 
So, basically his unconscious mind is quite happy playing a trick on him and 
frustrating the heck out of him until eventually he just cracks and says what’s 
going on? He said I was doing all the right things and it’s not working. 
 
 
As soon as he did pretty much the same process – actually because these 
were business goals that he had, we brought in a mediator, which is really a 
healer for businesses or it could be a business coach or whatever you want to 
call it. 
 
 
Remember family popped up. Family confronted him about if you keep doing 
this stuff we’re going to fail and it said great, you deserve to fail. Do we now 
have a sense of what needs to be fixed so that we can be the kind of person 
that can achieve all of that?

So, then he basically goes right back to a classic healing process and there 
were lots of fireworks and a lot of stuff happened as a result. I didn’t check 
the actual time period, but it seems that within days of that he got off the 
couch, he got motivated and decided to start doing stuff. 
 
 
He started seeing people and started going out and meeting people, and 
suddenly he’s making the connection he needs to make, and suddenly people 
are impressed by him because he’s talking with the same passion and 
probably more passion than he had before. 
 
 
One thing leads to another and says you need to meet so and so. He’s getting 
involved with projects with some very big players behind and he’s ecstatic. He 
has no idea how it happened.  
 
 
Is this magic? No. He was always capable of doing that. Consider the 
possibility. Consider the following experiment. There’s a country full of blind 
people and there’s gold leaflets flying down from the sky. They can’t see it but 
every now and again one land’s in their hand and they say I’m rich, this is 
great. 
 
 
Most people are sitting there trying to wait until their pockets fill up with 
gold, and they say once my pocket’s full of gold I’ll know this stuff works. They 
just wait and they wait and by a freak accident every now and again a little 
dust blows and it’s at just the right angle and a little bit of gold get into 
someone’s pocket, and they say see I told you it works. 
 
 
Now let’s imagine someone had just a little bit of sight and saw the gold 
coming down and just plucked it out of the air. In life there are always 
opportunities but if you are blind to them, you cannot take advantage of 
them.  
 
You can just wait and hope for the best that one of those opportunities will 
kick your door in and say look, like it or not it’s going to happen. That’s how 
most people think about the future in many ways. 
 
 
If that future doesn’t come kicking the door in, then whatever alternative 
happens randomly, that’s their life. It’s a very haphazard way of living life. So, 
what he had to do is to first become the kind of person that can even see 
those opportunities so that they can then start seizing the opportunities.

Then one thing escalates to another and before you know it some amazing 
things are happening. It seems like magic. In my opinion it’s not but then 
again you’re more than welcome to disagree with me. I really don’t care 
about the mechanics – well, I do care about the mechanics for me, but what’s 
more important to me is that it’s working. 
 
 
So, you’re on notice that this goal-setting process is lighting a fuse and at 
some point it may happen spontaneously – or you may have to get frustrated 
enough like he did to go back inside and ask what’s going on – to change 
something about yourself so that you can start seeing the opportunities that 
have been there all along but for some reason you couldn’t see for yourself. 
Does that make sense? Thank you for that. 
 
Student: Well actually Igor, you’ve just kind of answered my questions. 
 
Igor: 
You’re welcome. 
 
Student: The vision I’ve seen of how it could be outside of Bucket Land is just so very 
different. I mean it could happen on this planet but maybe not in this 
millennium.  
 
Igor: 
Here’s the thing. As soon as you’re someone else, the chance of that 
happening is much better. This is why it’s useful to have goals that scare us a 
little bit because they force us to rise to the occasion and become better than 
we were. 
 
 
But if you just sit there and say I’m just going to let the universe provide, 
there’s nothing I’ve got to do, I’m just going to wait there and it’s going to 
come to me, and you’re making no effort, you’re not confronting your own 
limitations, you’re not going down to the basement to reclaim what you need 
to be able to cope with that – good luck to you. Thank you for that. I 
appreciate that. 
 
Student: I’m sorry. 
 
Igor: 
Did I miss your point? 
 
Student: Yes, I’m sorry. 
 
Igor: 
Then please educate.

Student: I understand the whole process of course. It’s simple and I understand how I 
could fix it and I’m not one who wants to – look, I can’t even talk straight 
anymore. I’ll try it again. I’m not one who is waiting for Archangel Michael to 
come and resolve all my problems or do all the work for me. 
 
Igor: 
So, what’s the issue within the process you just had? 
 
Student: Well, how can I say it? Maybe give me two seconds. Well, you brought the 
Mike Tyson example up. I guess it was on the first day. It’s not even me 
fighting against Mike Tyson as opposed to a five-year-old toddler. I’m the five-
year-old toddler trying to box against Mike Tyson. He doesn’t even have the 
ability to stand up, so how can he box? 
 
Igor: 
So, then to borrow your metaphor there, all you need to do is to grow up 
enough to be able to do it. I appreciate that right now you don’t know how to 
do that. That’s why we have the other processes – the skill building room and 
a healer – and you can create a stepwise progression to that. 
 
 
Now I have no idea what the goal is that you have in mind, especially the 
unconscious goals. I have no idea and I have no idea how within the scope of 
reason they may or may not be, and that’s actually of no importance to me. 
 
 
In fact I don’t even know if they’re achievable goals because I don’t even 
know what the content is, but I do know one thing. You can become the type 
of person that could achieve that kind of goal, and that on its own – in other 
words whether you get a Ferrari or a Maserati is irrelevant. 
 
 
The point is you’re becoming the kind of person that can drive a Ferrari or a 
Maserati, and then the essence of the experience is there. The concern you’re 
having right now – that sense of this is too much, too overwhelming – is very 
similar to what this gentleman over here had a moment ago who was saying 
oh it’s a great future but you can’t do this, you can’t have this. 
 
 
It’s essentially the same thing that Chintan had over here when he said I did 
the healing and it failed. Why did I fail? They’re all the same questions in a 
different way.

That is exactly the part of you that you need to address in order to be able to 
even have a shot at whatever this big thing is. Now the chances are that one 
of two things will happen when you do address that. 
 
 
Either you suddenly revise what’s possible for you – you suddenly go from 
five-year-olds to a 25-year-old fit and strong like a bull and Tyson had better 
watch out – or you suddenly realize that version of the goal has served its 
purpose to inspire you to grow as a person, and a better goal that you 
couldn’t even conceive of currently inside of Bucket Land certain experience 
and that becomes clearer for you, and the other one becomes a fantasy that 
has served its purpose and you can move beyond that. Do you see where I’m 
going with this? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
But what you’ve discovered – and the unpleasantness that comes with it – is 
exactly where the wall of Bucket Land is and that’s where you have to do your 
work around. That’s where you need to be growing and you have a place to 
do that. That’s all your healing environments. 
 
 
I don’t recommend that you try doing it all at once. I tried that once and it 
was very, very painful. By the way, it didn’t work for me. Does that help? 
 
Student: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate this. It brings up a lot of stuff. For many people as life goes by, we 
kill our dreams more and more because we’ve failed to achieve them so often 
that we don’t want to take the hit of failing again, of being disappointed 
again. It’s just a defense mechanism there. 
 
 
We know there’s something outside of Bucket Land and we’ve banged our 
heads against the side of Bucket Land so often that we just don’t want to do 
that anymore, so we constrain our goals, our dreams, to be within Bucket 
Land, to be within what’s realistic as opposed to growing bigger than you 
were so that you can step out of Bucket Land and have a completely new 
perspective of what is and is not realistic. 
 
 
I’m not saying you will absolutely achieve that particular goal. I don’t even 
know what it is. What I can tell you is in the process of becoming the kind of 
person that can achieve that kind of goal, you’ll discover first of all whether 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
620 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
it’s even worth your while doing that one, but more importantly you’ll have 
had the main payoff. You will no longer be in Bucket Land. 
 
 
All of the goals that currently seem too big for you right now – aside from 
those particular ones – will seem insignificant and easy. Do you see where I’m 
going with this? I appreciate that it feels challenging at times, especially when 
you confront that edge directly. So, thank you for saying that. 
 
 
We’ll take one or two more comments and then we’ll have to a break. 
Otherwise there will be no time left today. 
 
Student: I just wanted to say as I got from progressive future to progressive future, it 
became more difficult to visualize because I didn’t really have the vocabulary 
for it. 
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Student: And then one small part on the guardian – the future step – mine said you still 
have free will and you’re going to have to be participating in this too. Once we 
made that agreement… 
 
Igor: 
To be fair, that’s good advice. It goes right back to what we said before, which 
is you can’t absolve yourself of responsibility and say everyone else do stuff, 
I’m just going to sit here and wait. 
 
Student: I think this process was very interesting, jumping from one goal to the next. It 
was kind of really mindblowing, even though I don’t know if I ended up with 
the right goal but it was growing bigger and bigger, and when I got to the third 
or fourth place, I thought this is too big. Do I really like it here? I wasn’t sure. 
 
Igor: 
I appreciate that. 
 
Student: Yes, but then I didn’t quite hear what you said for the last step, and I just 
thought well I’ll just do the whole process again, and I just went through it 
very fast and I landed in a place where everything was as large as the last one 
but it was more grounded. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: It was more real.

Igor: 
Excellent. 
 
Student: And I felt yes this is what I can live it, and it really feels like something is going 
on, some energies working in my vein. It feels very physical.  
 
Igor: 
You’ve just dipped your toes outside of Bucket Land. The first time it felt a bit 
cold, but now your toes are getting used to it and it’s time for the rest of your 
body to follow. 
 
 
Please notice something here. Traditional goal-setting tools tell you when 
you’ve picked your goal and done all these magical juju actions – whether it’s 
left-brain or right-brain and all the rest of it – then the goal will be created, 
and that’s all that has to happen. You will single-mindedly focus on that thing. 
 
 
Whereas what we’re doing here is this goal is going to change the whole of 
your life and in living up to that goal – whether you achieve it or not – your 
life will become significantly better because you’re no longer trapped within 
the Bucket Land.  
 
 
Do you understand the nature of what we’re trying to do here? 
Congratulations. Thank you for that. We’ll take one last comment and then 
we’ll have a break. 
 
Student: In the last part of the exercise, I was asking the mentors are you going to be 
the guardian, and they all came back no and then I just went quiet, and then 
this guardian appeared and I’m going what does that mean? Why are you 
here? 
 
 
It’s like I don’t know understand. Then the reply was exactly and now you 
can’t muck it up, and I’m sort of left with what’s my next step with that? Do I 
go back with baby steps with dealing with that image? 
 
Igor: 
Do you know what happens when you have a doubt like that or a confusion 
like that? You go inside and you ask them. 
 
Student: Aha. 
 
Igor: 
They’re the ones with the plan. I can’t answer that. So, you say great, seeing 
as I’m not supposed to muck it up, what should I do in the meantime? It’s just

learning to ask better questions of yourself now so that that kind of 
transformation can take place. 
 
 
Do you all get a sense or a feeling about how this process works now? Who’s 
excited about it? That’s a good point to go to lunch on.

DVD 19 – Expectations, A Student 
Examination Of Skills & Conclusion 
 
 
Certification Examination 
 
Igor: 
Welcome back. Did you have a nice lunch? 
 
Students: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
A little rushed I understand, especially on Sundays it’s a little quieter so it’s 
harder to get food. First of all, I hope you’ve enjoyed our time together so 
far in terms of stuff that you’ve learned.  
 
 
To recap very quickly, the first three days were building the fundamental 
skills to be able to do the ASH Method and basically navigate the inner 
landscape. If you want to have a motto for the first three days, this would be 
it: 
 
 
 
 Carpe Mentem – Seize The Mind 
 
Not beware of your mind, but seize the mind. Why seize the day when you 
have to seize the mind first?  
 
 
The last two days have been all about this idea of: 
 
 
 Magna Est Vis Mentem – Discovering how powerful the power of your  
mind really is 
 
 
Would it be fair to say that you’ve all had at least a taste of what’s possible 
with that, yes?  
 
 
So, for those of you who are taking the certification now, we’re now going 
into the final exam so to speak, and I’ll show you what’s expected of you in a 
moment. It’s actually very straightforward and very easy. I’ll leave it up on 
the screen. It’s nothing you haven’t done already, which is a good thing.

The only caveat I’ll provide about the whole exam thing is it’s your mind, 
and I currently haven’t figured out how to step into your mind and see 
exactly what you’re doing.  
 
 
So, if you’re really committed to deceiving me you’ll probably succeed, but it 
would be pointless because the exam isn’t for me. It’s for you to have a 
threshold, a sense of you’ve achieved something worthwhile. Do you 
understand what I mean by that?  
 
 
So, it’s a bit of an honor system in that sense. I will be walking around to 
listen in to make sure that you guys at least have an understanding of what 
the key parts of the method mean, but other than that it’s really about your 
practice.  
 
 
So, what I expect you to do is the following. Get a partner that you’ll be 
working with. My recommendation right now is to turn to the person next 
to you and that’s your partner. Everyone has a partner, correct?  
 
 
All right, so your examine will last 30 minutes apiece. One person will do the 
first round a whole 30 minutes and the other person will do the second one 
of 30 minutes. Please do not leave once you’ve done your 30 minutes 
because the other guy or girl still needs your services.  
 
 
Here is all that’s expected of you for the exam. It’s everything you’ve done 
so far.   
 
 
  
ASH Exam: 
 
1. Mindfulness – 2 mins 
2. Neighborhood Tour – 5 mins 
3. Teleport (random + interaction/sit with it) – 5 mins 
4. Teleport (mood + Interaction/sit with it) – 5mins 
5. Transform (2-5 times) – 5mins 
6. Simple Healing – 5 mins 
7. Skill Rehearsal – 3 mins 
 
 
  
Total Time – 28 mins

1. Some mindfulness practice, any mindfulness practice you wish, for two 
minutes. 
 
 
You won’t know when it’s two minutes, so this is where your partner needs 
to help you. In other words, they’ll watch the clock for you and when two 
minutes approaches they’ll just tap you on the shoulder and say okay you 
can come back now so that you can continue. So, partners your main role is: 
 
 To be a listening device for the other person to talk at – not to, but 
at; and  
 
 To keep an eye on time so that everyone stays roughly within these 
times.  
 
 
So just keep an eye out. We’ll have a countdown for you.  
 
2. Once you’ve done your mindfulness, I’d like you to do a tour of your 
neighborhood for about five minutes.  
 
 
For those of you who think, oh my goodness, I’ll be done in two minutes in 
my neighborhood, well then go to someone else’s neighborhood. I do this 
exercise here for three and a half hours, just as a really weird thing of 
testing myself. Anyways, five minutes is all that’s required. It’s easy and 
should be very straightforward for everyone.  
 
3. In the second one, the next 10 minutes will be two sets of 
teleportation. One will be random and you’ll attempt to interact with 
whatever is there.  
 
 
If something is there that doesn’t want to interact with you, it doesn’t mean 
you’ve failed. It means that the response is that you’ll sit with that symbol, 
whether it interacts with you or not.  
 
 
So, the skill is you’ll either interact, which is good because they’ll hear you 
interacting, or if there’s a problem interacting, sit and have that benign 
attention on it and whether that resolves it or not, that’s going to be 
enough. Once you’ve been there for a little while you can move on to see if 
you can get an interaction in another place.

4. The second version of the teleportation game is the same only instead 
of being random movements you’re going to constrain it to pleasant – 
once again pleasant – emotional experiences.  
 
 
You can choose and say take me to a happy place or you can say to the 
unconscious mind take me somewhere that’s pleasant, take me somewhere 
else that’s pleasant and so on.  
 
 
Again, you will attempt interaction. If interaction is denied, then just sit with 
it. Otherwise just run the interaction. It’s only five minutes, again very 
simple. In between each exercise of course come back and restart again 
with your whole practice – mindfulness, mentalization, grounding and 
integration breathing at the end.  
 
 
Number five is the same again.  
 
5. Go through landscapes, however many you want, and transform 
between two and five times, but at least twice.  
 
 
You can keep going upwards. You just don’t want to change every two 
seconds. You want to transform, have a little sense of that, have a minute or 
two of enjoying that and then do it again. You’ll probably only get two or 
three done in the session. 
 
 
If you’re doing it more than five times, you’re going too quickly, because 
you’ll notice the transforming exercise is only three minutes. So, it’s about a 
minute per transformation to get a sense of what it’s like.  
 
 
For transformation, if you remember you become something. You become a 
leaf, you become an owl or you become a stone. You won’t know what it is 
until you get there.  
 
 
Do you remember the exercise where you just turned up somewhere? I 
believe you became a rock and so on. You just notice what grabs your 
attention and become it.  
 
 
If you fail in the transformation and for whatever reason there’s a blockage, 
what do you do?  
 
Students: Sit with it.

Igor: 
Exactly.  
 
6. Next we have a simple healing. By a simple healing, notice there’s not 
much time – just five minutes. Turn up to a place of healing and ask for 
a symbolic healing of some sort.  
 
 
Don’t ask for a specific healing in terms of I want to resolve this issue, 
because five minutes may not be enough. Just ask your unconscious mind to 
present a figure of healing to do some kind of symbolic healing on you that 
will fit within the time limit you have. 
 
7. Finally for the skill rehearsal, choose a really simple little skill or task 
that you can accomplish.  
 
Go to a practice room and for about three minutes rehearse that skill, and of 
course you’re describing it out loud what you’re doing at the same time, at 
the end of which you can come back and you’re pretty much done at that 
point. 
 
 
The whole thing takes 28 minutes. You have half an hour just so you have 
some slush time in between. Do you all understand what you’re doing with 
this? It’s a skill rehearsal, any skill you want. Just go to your mental practice 
room and practice it whilst describing what you’re doing. 
 
 
The reason for having a partner is you will out loud describe each of these 
steps. I’ll be walking around and I’ll be listening in and checking on you. It’s 
an honor system but it’s not entirely honorable. You have 28 minutes, so 
you have a little bit of slush time in case you want to take a break before 
starting the second round. 
 
 
If you need to take a break, please bear in mind that for the next hour 
people will be working, so if you do need to have a little break and have a 
chit-chat before the next round, please do it outside. Just go outside, have 
your chit-chat and come back in time because that clock will keep ticking, 
and you will not pass if you’ve just been doing 10 minutes of these 
exercises. 
 
 
I want to see you making an attempt at all the various stages. I do not care 
about how clear any of these mentalization processes are. All I care about is

that you have enough that you can talk about. Does that make sense to 
you? Are there any questions from those of you who are certifying? 
 
Student: 
Should we then come back seven times? 
 
Igor: 
You’ll be returning seven times, so it’s seven separate exercises, each one of 
which will have the classic mindfulness practice, mentalization, body scan or 
some grounding practice, and some integration practice. It should be very 
straightforward. This should be old hat to all of you at this point. 
 
 
All of you who are not certifying – except the one person and you know who 
you are – please move to the back of the room right now and I’ll have a chat 
with you in a moment. Let’s start the time now. Off you go. 
 
End Of Training 
 
Igor: 
Settle yourselves down. Welcome back, everyone. Here’s a question you 
don’t hear very often. Who enjoyed the exam? First of all, let me put you 
out of the misery you’re probably not in. Congratulations everyone. You’ve 
passed. Give yourselves a round of applause. 
 
 
We’ll talk about the certificate stuff in a moment when we finish up. Before 
we do that, I have some final closing thoughts here. The first thought I want 
to leave you with is you’ve put a lot of effort in over the last five days and 
it’s been hard work at times, hasn’t it? 
 
 
I think all of you have experienced a significant progression in your skill. No 
matter which point you reached, you got further than when you first 
actually arrived here and, more importantly, you know how to continue that 
progression.  
 
 
I encourage you to carry on. It’s just a minute a day. Just start it that way. 
Whenever you have a spare minute, just do it for the heck of it. You don’t 
need any equipment, so just do it when you can and it will continue to build 
and build and build.  
 
 
Let me explain to you why there might be a bit of extra self-interest. If it’s 
not enough that your life will transform and you’ll get out of Bucket Land 
and have a wonderful time and life will be just fine and dandy, then you may

be interested to know that at some point in the future I have planned 
advanced versions of this course with specialty areas of interest, and it can 
only be opened to those that have proficiency in the level you’ve discovered 
here. 
 
 
In other words, when you can do this as easily as you can write a letter 
home, then the advanced courses will take you to places that your friends 
won’t even believe are possible.  
 
 
There would be no point turning up to those courses if you haven’t 
practiced because we’re not going to be starting back on day one. Assuming 
that you’ve spent some time practicing everything we’ve done here, it will 
be relatively straightforward for you to do. Does that make sense? 
 
 
So, out of enlightened self-interest on a double path, enjoy your practice. Do 
it. Remember, as in most of the courses, what I’ve hoped to share with you 
are some principles about how I believe the mind works, and hopefully 
you’ve had experiences of those principles in action, at least sufficiently to 
make it worth your while to explore those further. 
 
 
That means something very important. As time progresses, you should be 
deviating from the methods you learned here increasingly. This is a starting 
point. You now have to figure out how to do this practice with your mind, 
and it will change with each one of you. 
 
 
You have to learn how to work with your inner symbols. You have to learn 
how to do your own heroic journey. As you noticed, today we did some 
troubleshooting with a number of people who kind of got stuck along the 
way somewhere, and the only reason they were stuck is because they’re 
thinking of what you’ve learned here not as a method but instead as a set of 
techniques - well, I did the technique and it didn’t work. What now?  
 
 
But if you switch your point of view from a technique to a method, then you 
use the method to resolve any problems within the method. It’s a built-in 
diagnostic tool. It’s called your unconscious, and with that you should be 
able to achieve more than you can currently conceive whilst you’re standing 
within Bucket Land.  
 
 
The first thing I want to say before we end up is I look forward to seeing you 
once you’re in Bathtub Country. The second thing I’d like to remind you of is 

Beyond Self Hypnosis – Transcript Manual 
 
630 Beyond Self Hypnosis            ©Hypnosis Training Academy   All Rights Reserved 
 
that you are not a noun. You’re a verb. What? That means you’re a work in 
process.  
 
 
That means you have time to change. You’re not static. The way you 
currently are will change whether you like it or not. My hope is that you use 
at least some of the stuff you learned here so that your change is a positive 
one, rather than a negative one. 
 
 
If you take nothing else away from here than that, I think that will be worth 
your while. So, as is traditional at the end of such things, I’d like to thank all 
of you for turning up here because without you, there would be no me of up 
here doing this. It’s very lonely in an empty room otherwise. So, thank you 
very much. Give yourselves a nice round of applause.  
 
 
We also have a number of people to thank who without whose work, none 
of this would have occurred. Of course we have our assistants in the back 
who have seamlessly kept everything from falling apart at the seams, so give 
them a nice round of applause. We have of course the magical Megan right 
over here.  
 
 
In his absence, although he has walked in and out a few times as a ghost – 
he usually peeks in to see if you’re actually busy before he’ll come in – is 
Clifford, who without his advertising and setting all this stuff out, none of 
this would have been possible. So, let’s give him a thank you in absentia. 
 
 
I’d also like to thank all the people in the Beta test group who were willing 
to risk their sanity for a totally unproven method and gave it enough proof 
that it made it worthwhile for you to come. In particular Joe and Johnny, 
who were very helpful in tweaking those aspects that have made your life a 
lot easier. So, thank you guys. Even though you’re not here, we appreciate 
your 
efforts. 
 
 
Finally once again thank you all for coming. I’ve really enjoyed teaching this 
method. It’s been on my mind for many years and I don’t know about you, 
but I’ve had a thoroughly good time, so if you didn’t, tough luck. I enjoyed it 
myself. Thank you again.
