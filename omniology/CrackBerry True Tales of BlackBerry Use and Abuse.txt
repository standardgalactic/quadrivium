The Authors’
Stories 
Before we begin in earnest with our 12-step program, we’re going to take a few 
pages to tell you our own stories of BlackBerry use and abuse. We suspect you 
will probably recognize yourself in many of our stories; in so doing, you may 
find that this book is the intervention you never knew you needed. 
 Gary’s Story
I have been using my BlackBerry for the least amount of time (compared to 
Martin and Kevin). I entered the BlackBerry world about four years ago. My 
training was actually as a member of the clergy—I am an ordained Rabbi—but 
my love of technology always seemed to permeate everything I did. I was known 
for using my personal digital assistant PDA (i.e., handheld computer) at funerals 
and weddings to help me remember my talking points. (Many services were 
outside, so the computer helped me avoid using paper that might fly away in the 
wind.) This worked great until they started adding phones to these PDAs. It 
wasn’t so great when I forgot to turn off my phone ringer, and the “Star Wars 
Theme” rang out at graveside one day—much to the shocked stares of the 
grieving. 

xi 
These days, I teach college courses on line for the University of Phoenix and  
work with Martin at  Made Simple Learning as Partner, Vice President and co-
author of our books. My busy life truly needs organization. One day a few years 
ago, a brand new BlackBerry Curve 8300 appeared for review on one of the 
websites I was writing for—and it was love at first roll of the trackball! 
I came to rely on my BlackBerry Curve for just about everything. I set different 
tones to remind me to complete various tasks. These tones tell me what 
appointment is upcoming,  who is calling, and even  when text messages arrive 
from my family. My beloved BlackBerry is always ringing (usually with a movie 
theme or a rock song), and it often rings when and where it shouldn’t. I try hard 
to remember to turn it off when riding my bike, on the golf course, at worship, 
or in the movies. But sometimes I forget, and it can be truly embarrassing. 

xii 
The BlackBerry brought push email (see the Appendix A: “CrackBerry Terms and 
Definitions”) to my world. And like all new BlackBerry users, I immediately 
became hooked on the instant gratification of getting my email wherever I was. 
Without realizing it, I developed a habit of looking for that little red light that 
indicates a new message has arrived about at least once a minute or so. I also 
found myself grabbing my BlackBerry each time the red light went off or the 
device vibrated—even when I was behind the wheel! 

xiii 
One day, I was driving with my oldest son, who had just received his driving 
permit. Without realizing it, I was driving the car, shifting the stick shift, 
adjusting the volume of the Bluetooth hands free, changing the channel on the 
remote of the satellite radio, and checking my email on the BlackBerry—all 
while traveling 40 MPH down a winding country road. 
And I chose this moment to turn to my son and say, “Remember: When you 
drive, always keep your eyes on the road and be ready to react in an 
emergency.” My son just laughed at me and shook his head. Obviously, I was 
doing so many things that my eyes and mind could not possibly be focused on 
the road. Thankfully, I have not had any accidents (yet), and I hope to avoid 
doing any more texting while driving. (See the true-life story about someone 
wrecking a Mercedes while using a BlackBerry in Chapter 1: “I Can’t Be Without 
It”).  
In the last couple of years, Martin and I have branched out to write books about 
the iPad, iPhone, Palm Pre and soon the Droid.  While all these devices have an 
element of addiction potential, I still find myself coming back “home” to 
whatever BlackBerry is on my desk or in my pocket – there is just something 
about these things! I hope you can learn a few things from this book that will 
help you curb your own BlackBerry uses and abuses. 

xiv 
 Kevin’s Story 
My BlackBerry story began in 2005, when the release of the company’s first real 
“consumer device” made BlackBerry became a household name. Prior to that, it 
was mainly just people in the corporate world who were aware of the device 
and having to grapple with BlackBerry addiction. My own introduction to the 
BlackBerry happened as it surely has for many others—it was given to me on the 
first day of a new job. 
I went to work as a Business Development analyst for one of Canada’s biggest 
media companies. Shortly after noon during my first day on the job, a tech guy 
from the IT department came down to my office and set me up with old Blue, the 
brick-like BlackBerry 7290. My training lesson was short. Here’s the email, here’s 
the phone, here’s how you mark prior messages, and here’s your phone 
number.  
Although I also considered myself a gadget nut, I had no experience with 
BlackBerry smartphones prior to this first meeting. I first learned about the 
BlackBerry from a university case study that, ironically enough, was actually 
about a competitor: the Handspring Visor. A short time later, I became good 
friends with a guy who claimed to be addicted to his BlackBerry. (I had never 
really got to see my friend’s BlackBerry close up—I should have realized then 
that its grasp was strong!) This was my first real, face-to-face encounter with 
what would ultimately become the focus of the next few years of my life. 
At first meeting, I wasn’t all that excited about the device. It was big compared to 
my streamlined Samsung flip phone. It also seemed kind of clunky, with an ’80s 
look to it, despite the fact the year was 2005. 
I wasn’t all that excited by my new toy, and I was not yet that busy with my new 
job, so I left the big blue ’Berry on my desk for two days. On the third day after 
arriving at this new job, I noticed it again. Thinking the phone would be long 
dead, I went to charge it, but noticed then that the battery meter had barely 
moved. I remember thinking: “Wow, what a long battery life! Maybe there is 
something to this BlackBerry thing.”  

xv 
Once I finally picked up and used the device, the BlackBerry smartphone’s hold 
on me was immediate and unshakable. I quickly mastered the ins-and-outs of 
the device. I couldn’t believe how intuitive it was, nor how fast it was to use. 
I took the BlackBerry everywhere with me—it was my newspaper in the stall 
during my morning bathroom breaks, my alarm clock in the bedroom, my 
entertainment during my commute (BrickBreaker skills extraordinaire), my way 
to kill time when waiting in line, and my distraction of choice when bored. The 
BlackBerry became my 24/7 companion who was always there for me, without 
exception. It was also my constant connection to my employer and work tasks, 
but I saw that as a good thing—it allowed me to get my job done better. 
Although I didn’t classify my reliance on the device as an addiction at that point, 
I knew I had become dependent on the BlackBerry when it was taken away after I 
left the company. I lasted all of four days before I had to buy my own personal 
BlackBerry to get my life get back to normal again. 

xvi 
Mygirlfriend
HatedIt!
TheBlackBerrywasmy
Priority Always
The BlackBerry was like electricity to me. I would never want to go back to life 
without it. But my blinders were on. I saw my BlackBerry as the greatest thing 
ever, but its features came at a significant cost. The BlackBerry became my 
priority—always. My girlfriend hated it. It didn’t matter if we were watching a 
movie, out for dinner, or in the bedroom: we were never alone. The device was 
always at my side. If it vibrated, chirped, or blinked its red light, I was instantly 
reaching for it. 
My coworkers hated the device. One time, I was out for lunch with everyone, 
telling a story with five minutes of setup. Then, in mid-sentence, I saw the red 
flashing light and stopped dead to grab my BlackBerry. I just left everybody 
hanging! And so it continued. My priority was the BlackBerry, and that meant 
that everything and everybody else was secondary. 
Theyjustdon’tget
itbecausetheydon’t
ownaBlackBerry…
Like many addicts, I didn’t realize I had a problem. I didn’t seek to control my 
addiction—I believed that others had the problem because they just “didn’t get 
it.” And they didn’t get it because they didn’t have their own BlackBerry. Being 
the helpful and caring guy that I am, I took care of the issue by buying my 
girlfriend a BlackBerry and convincing many of my non-BlackBerry using 
friends and colleagues to give the BlackBerry a try, as well. 
As hard as the addiction hit me, it also took hold of everyone I introduced to the 
BlackBerry. I thought all my problems were solved: nobody seemed to mind me 
using my BlackBerry anymore because everyone else had their own BlackBerry 

xvii 
smartphones, too. Communication with my friends also improved. We used 
BBM to tie us all together. 
MaybethisAddiction
thingwas
REALproblem!
It was a few months after I bought my girlfriend a BlackBerry that it began to 
dawn on me that BlackBerry addiction was becoming a real problem. It wasn’t 
an observation of my own behavior that spawned this revelation—no, I was a 
pro at justifying my own actions. Rather, it was an evening at home with my 
girlfriend, when I discovered she was more in the mood to play with her 
BlackBerry than in the mood to play with me. It was her BlackBerry addiction 
that was driving me nuts!  
At this point, I knew I had to learn to control my BlackBerry use better, despite 
my love for the gadget. In so doing, I could show others the way (my girlfriend 
included), so this terrible incident would never happen again. 

xviii 
 Martin’s Story 
My first exposure to the BlackBerry actually began in the fall of 2001. I was 
walking through a tradeshow floor in Atlanta with my brother-in-law, Ned 
Johnson. We were attending the show to help develop ideas to get our new 
consulting and technology business up and running. We were amazed by the 
BlackBerry 857 and 957 shown at a booth. We thought: “Wow—we can have 
access to read and reply to work email anywhere, anytime—that’s fantastic!” 
After we got back to Detroit, we purchased our first two BlackBerry 
smartphones. We even started peddaling them to our consulting clients.  Selling 
them was great until our clients had a question or problem with their 
BlackBerry.  It was at that point I began to realize that these things were addictive 
because of the severe pain they caused when they didn’t work correctly.  Which, 
fortunately, was rare.  

xix 
Wewerehooked…
Instantresponses
toclientemail
anywhere,anytime!
We were hooked. Being a very small company that tried to be responsive to big 
clients, we used the devices to respond to all emails within a few minutes, rather 
than at the end of every day. It was great for both our clients and our growing 
business. We even got an lifestyle improvement. Instead of taking an extra 30 
minutes at the end of every day to read and respond to email, we were “free.” Or 
so we thought. 
Weactuallybelieved
ourLifestylehad
improved!
Then the symptoms began. First, it was a matter of checking the BlackBerry every 
time it buzzed and flashed: while watching TV, during family meals, in the car at 
stop lights, and eventually while driving on an “easy stretch of road.” 
My increased personal time started to morph into increased and never-ending 
work time. My family started to question and complain about my BlackBerry 
use. When I disappeared for a few minutes, my wife, Julie, would begin to ask: 
“Were you checking your BlackBerry?” I am a terrible liar, so I just had to confess 
immediately. I’d start to relish the times when I could check my BlackBerry 
without anyone else seeing my growing habit. Many times, the solitude of the 
bathroom was now “BlackBerry-time.”  

xx 
I’drelish thetimeswhenI
could‘stealaway’and
checkmyBlackBerry
Once, to my great horror, I even dropped my BlackBerry right into the toilet.  I
snatched it out immediately, with little to no concern of what else was in there. I
opened it right up and laid out the battery, battery cover, and SIM card on a
paper towel. I gazed at my precious BlackBerry all opened up and spread across
the counter in pieces. I almost felt as if I should draw white chalk lines around
the pieces. Then, I started right away on resuscitating the waterlogged center of
my universe. I began by trying to blow in all the holes, before breaking out the
hair dryer out to try and salvage my precious. 
Well, the CPR process worked, and the BlackBerry performed faithfully for
another six months until it finally sputtered and died right in the middle of a
phone call. I now had the perfect excuse to lay down some cash for the newest
and greatest BlackBerry—thereby scoring another fix for my growing addiction. 
I knew that I needed professional help, and I wondered if there were other
users/abusers out there that might be able to benefit from my stories and those
of other BlackBerry abusers. About that time, Gary and I hooked up with Kevin at
www.CrackBerry.com, and we started laying the groundwork for this book. We
gathered up lots of stories and other addiction avoidance tips, tricks, and
strategies from the BlackBerry community and included the best of them in this
short book. We hope you enjoy them and can benefit from our brief guide to
overcoming BlackBerry addiction! 

xxi 
Introduction 
We, the authors (Martin, Gary, and Kevin), sincerely thank you for taking the 
time to read this book on BlackBerry addiction. You may have purchased this 
book yourself or received it as a gift from a concerned colleague or loved one. 
However this guide came into your hands, we hope that we can help you make 
some small strides both toward becoming aware of your possible BlackBerry 
overuse and abuse, as well as in curbing those addictive BlackBerry behaviors 
you may have developed in your daily life. 
■TIP Do you know people addicted to their iPhone, Android, or other phones? 
The smartphone landscape has continued to evolve in the two years since we wrote the first 
edition of this book.  Now one could easily replace BlackBerry with iPhone or Android phones.  
While the stories and book are focused on BlackBerry smartphones, many of the same 
concepts will apply equally well regardless of type of phone you happen to be carrying around. 
The BlackBerry is such a powerful and compelling tool that it can coax addictive 
or inappropriate behaviors out of even the most stalwart people. Our simple 
goal is that you become fully aware of your BlackBerry use, be much more 
sensitive to those around you, and in the end become a much more responsible 
BlackBerry user.   

xxii 
■CAUTION Constant Interruptions Can Hurt Your Brain's Abilities 
Did you know that constant interruptions caused by your BlackBerry and other electronic 
devices can harm your ability to develop long-term memories and create new ideas?  Loren 
Frank, a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, said downtime 
lets the brain go over experiences, “solidify them and turn them into permanent long-term 
memories.”1 
We hope that you begin to re-focus your attention away from the people on the 
other end of your BlackBerry to balance it with those people (friends, family and 
colleagues) that you can see and touch in your immediate vicinity.

Many of us exhibit some addictive BlackBerry behaviors without even knowing 
it. We are so finely attuned to our BlackBerry that our attention can be 
instantaneously diverted by a quick buzz or flash of red light. Most times, we are 
not even aware that we are ignoring those around us, including those with 
whom we were speaking before the BlackBerry’s interruption. 
By no means do we advocate going “cold turkey,” nor do we recommend 
getting rid of your precious ’Berry (there are many BlackBerry competitors out 
there, but there is only one BlackBerry!). We do, however, want you to develop 
an awareness of those bad habits and begin to employ some of our strategies to 
help you stop them. These habits can range from minor etiquette problems to 
actions that are very dangerous to yourself and others. Please take the stories to 
heart. Maybe you can identify with some of them, and thereby become more

steps to improve your life with a BlackBerry.

Each of this book’s authors has found a way to turn his love of his BlackBerry 
smartphone into his job. Kevin is a 110% BlackBerry-related worker, and Gary 
and Martin live on all sorts of technology – including their BlackBerrys pretty 
much all day long.  All of us have a multitude of stories of BlackBerry use and 
abuse that we will share in the course of this book. We will also share the stories 
of many BlackBerry users; their stories will serve both as cautionary lessons and 
inspirational examples for curbing the more destructive aspects of BlackBerry 
overuse and abuse. This book is both a labor of love and a byproduct of three 
entrepreneurs who are admittedly addicted to their BlackBerry smartphones.

The Responsible BlackBerry User 
We feel that it is important to say that BlackBerry smartphones can be—and 
are—extremely useful tools. They help us stay connected with colleagues, 
friends, and family; and  they give us a freedom-of-movement and ease-of-use 
never before possible in a portable device. All BlackBerry devices today provide 
email, phone, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), SMS text messaging, and web 
browsing out-of-the-box. They also include features such as cameras, GPS, and 

xxiv 
WiFi, as well as support for powerful and popular apps such as Facebook, 
Twitter,  Flikr, YouTube, and many more.  
The BlackBerry frees us from sitting at our computer, enabling us to do many 
things that previously required us to be tethered to our desk. In many emerging 
markets, such as Indonesia and Venezuela, the availability of the Internet in 
homes is less prevalent. BlackBerry smartphone sales have skyrocketed in such 
cases, with the BlackBerry serving as an individual’s main connection to the 
Internet. In other words, the BlackBerry can be a very good—and even a great—
thing! It is precisely this high-degree of connectivity and usefulness that can lead 
some people to become compulsive in their use or abuse of the device. 
 Phantom Vibrations 
I sometimes suffer from a case of phantom BlackBerry. That’s when 
my BlackBerry is not on my belt, but I can still feel it vibrate as if it 
were receiving email. I reach down to check it… and it’s not there! Am 
I losing it? 
—Paul C., MadeSimpleLearning.com Customer 
Unlike other habits that can morph into addiction, such as alcohol, drugs, and 
gambling, a BlackBerry habit does not have to become destructive to yourself or 
others. A heavy BlackBerry user can also be a responsible BlackBerry user. One 
of the main goals of this book is to help you become a more responsible 
BlackBerry user. 
TheResponsibleBlackBerryUserCredo:
IpromisenottousemyBlackBerryinanysituationthat
couldharmmyselforothers– eitherinbodyormind.
Sometimes a BlackBerry user’s abusive behavior can be characterized as a simple 
lack of good manners (e.g., ignoring others in a conversation); other times, it can 
be downright dangerous (e.g., crashing a car while using a BlackBerry). You will 
see examples at both ends of the spectrum of BlackBerry abuse in this book, as 
well as a few more in our “Chart of Shame” (see Figure 1).

Early Days of the CrackBerry 
The term CrackBerry has been used to define BlackBerry addicts since the early 
days of the device in the late 1990s; however, it’s only in the last few years that 
the term has gone mainstream. 
It’sprettyaddictive,
that’swhytheycallit
CrackBerry

xxvi 
The degree to which many people now understand the term, both BlackBerry 
and non-BlackBerry users alike, reflects the strength of this BlackBerry 
addiction. The earliest citation of the term CrackBerry traces back to 2000 when 
Dennis Kavelman, the CFO of Research In Motion (the BlackBerry smartphone’s 
manufacturer) was interviewed by Geoff Colvin from CNBC: 
 
Earliest Citation of the term “CrackBerry”
Kavelman:  “I’m not sure if you guys use BlackBerry or have tried it, 
but it is pretty addictive.” 
Colvin:  
“Well, it is addictive and on Wall Street they call it 
CrackBerry for exactly that reason. Once you try it you 
can’t live without it, so they say.” 
—From Research In Motion CFO Interview, CNBC, Sept. 29, 
2000
 
BlackBerry users are passionate about their devices and willing to admit their 
dependence upon them.  
 Benefits of BlackBerry Wireless Email 
My BlackBerry enables me to prepare for the workday ahead. I know 
what kind of day I am going to have, and most days I will not log onto 
my computer much before 11:00am. The BlackBerry allows me this 
luxury.
—Alex W.

CrackBerry Terms Defined 
We were asked to define the word, so we came up with our own definition of the 
term CrackBerry: 
CrackBerry
-n, pl –ries 
informal slang,  nickname for a BlackBerry smartphone that typically 
has a seductive flashing red light, vibration and satisfying keyboard that 
appears to have an addictive hold on many people who use it.  People 
with a more severe addiction tend to ignore their immediate 
surroundings whenever the device vibrates or flashes, whether they are 
talking to someone, driving, walking or enjoying a meal with friends.  
Sometimes, people feel phantom vibrations This addictive nature can 
be controlled with a modified 12-step program found in the book 
CrackBerry: True Tales of BlackBerry Use and Abuse. 
And below is a related term.  
CrackBerry Prayer  
-n, pl –s 
informal slang,   the act of trying to use your BlackBerry device by hiding 
it in one’s lap, usually surreptitiously.  The act looks somewhat like the 
individual is praying since they are holding the BlackBerry quietly in 
their lap, their hands are together (almost like praying), their shoulders 
are slightly hunched and their head is bowed to enable them to read the 
device.   
If you have a question about some of the terms used in this book, please check 
out Appendix A: “CrackBerry Terms and Definitions” for a complete list of 
CrackBerry-related terms such as push email, hard reset, BlackBerry Prayer, 
and many more. If you don’t see the information you’re looking for, then you

result to a question you’re trying to answer or a problem you’re trying to solve. 
I have been 2 minutes from work and realized my phone was on the 
counter at home and turned around and driven all the way back home to 
get it even though it meant being late for work. I'd much rather take my 
chances with my boss on being late than having to endure a whole 
workday without my BlackBerry!

Presidential BlackBerry Addiction 
Perhaps no single individual has done more for BlackBerry addiction 
recognition as our President, Barak Obama. His BlackBerry use (and abuse) was 
widely chronicled during the presidential campaign of 2008. 
Also widely reported was his desire to keep his beloved BlackBerry once he took  
office.  
Jeff Zeleny of the New York Times wrote; 
“For years, like legions of other on-the-move professionals, Obama 
has been all but addicted to his BlackBerry. The device has rarely 
been far from his side - on most days, it was fastened to his belt - to 
provide a singular conduit to the outside world as the bubble around 
him grew tighter and tighter throughout his campaign.”2
In the end, the President was able to use a specially configured BlackBerry and 
can only email about 10 individuals in his inner circle – not quite what the 
BlackBerry addict was looking for, but, better than no BlackBerry at all!

The Path to a BlackBerry 12 Step 
Program
The core of this book is structured in 12, easy-to-read chapters. Each chapter 
loosely mirrors the theme of the traditional 12 steps used by many addiction 
recovery programs today. You may notice some similarity and repetition 
between several chapters; this is intentional because we want to reinforce some 
of the key points and stay true to the spirit of the original 12 steps program, 
which also includes some degree of repetition. We give credit to the original 12 
Steps that were published in the book, Alcoholics Anonymous in 19393. 
We hope that you will take these 12 steps to heart. Some steps may be relatively 
easy for you, others may be quite difficult. It all depends on your personality,

You may notice that our 12 chapters do not follow the original 12 steps exactly; 
however, we do try to be conscious of the original 12 steps as our guiding 
principles. Some of the verbiage and stories are clearly tongue-in-cheek. 
Nevertheless, we strongly believe there are serious issues raised that many of us 
can relate to. Unfettered BlackBerry overuse can cause problems in our 
relationships, in our careers, and in our social interaction. The stories contained 
within this book and the analysis and suggestions of the authors will, we hope, 
help you on chart a path to safe and responsible BlackBerry use.

“I Can’t Be 
  Without It!” 
In this chapter, we’ll cover the first step to overcoming BlackBerry addiction: 
admitting we have a problem. 
Weareruledbythelittle
REDblinkinglight!
Step1:
AdmitWeArePowerless
WithoutOurBlackBerry
Step 1: Admit we are powerless without our BlackBerry. Our lives have 
become unmanageable without our beloved ’Berrys. Like Pavlovian dogs, we 
are slaves to the little red light, including its vibrations and rings. 

2 
In other words, the first step in beginning to overcome our addiction is to stop 
and think about the way that the BlackBerry interferes with our lives and to 
admit that we are powerless over its pull. 
Consider this common experience. We put our BlackBerry smartphone down 
beside our computer and type away. Every few seconds, however, we find 
ourselves looking to the side. “Did we just see the red light blink?” We wonder. 
We pick it up to take a closer look. No, no light, so back to work we go. We 
repeat this process every few minutes. “Did my friend reply to my BBM yet?” 
“Maybe I should PING him!” “I love typing and feel the clickety clack of the 
keyboard!”   
We could swear that we saw that light go off. More often than not, we are 
mistaken. 
IwaslostwhenmyBlackBerrywas
lost… Oncelocated,Imadeavow–
nevertolosemycompanionagain.
Source:Steve– BlackBerryAbuser
What does this say about us? Well, it says that we might very well be addicted 
to our BlackBerry. It isn’t just the light we look for. When we have our 
BlackBerry holstered or in Vibrate mode, we are certain we can feel our little 
buddy shake on our belt. Often, we are mistaken. These phantom vibrations 
are a little bit spooky, and they speak to our continual attachment to our 
BlackBerry device. That same attachment led the authors to sit down and 
write this book. 

3 
 Must…Check…Messages Now! 
Who waits 30 minutes to check their BlackBerry? Not me. It’s a 
Pavlovian response. The bell goes off to indicate a message. I walk 
like Frankenstein across the room, arms out— “must... check... 
messages...”
If someone writes me, I must immediately see what that person wants 
or needs. I try to turn my BlackBerry off on weekends and at night, 
but what if someone needs something? 
Anyone else ever forget to “go” when the traffic light turns green 
because they’re busy reading or writing messages? 
—Karen L. 
An International Problem 
The problem seems to transcend the shores of North America—it is a world-
wide problem. In August of 2010, Saudi Arabia’s telecom operator CITC 
announced a ban on BlackBerry services due to security concerns. (The 
argument was that the BlackBerry security system was too good to be broken 
by the government so it might be used by criminals without detection.) 
This has been met with resistence and a fair bit of anger from BlackBerry 
Addicts in the Middle East.  
  Reaction to Proposed BlackBerry Ban 
I understand that there is a security issue and that’s why it’s being 
banned,” says Manal Sanai, “But it’s really going to affect my social life. I 
spend hours BBMing [BlackBerry Messaging] my friends. There is only 
one person in my class who doesn’t have one and if you don’t have one 
then you are kind of left behind. 
—Manal Sanai, a self-confessed BlackBerry addict1

The Roots of the Problem 
So, what is it about our BlackBerry smartphone that has us continually 
checking to see whether the light is going off or if the device is vibrating, even 
when it isn’t? There are no single, simple answer for this—many reasons exist 
for our attachment and addiction to our BlackBerry. 
That said, there are a few key reasons that help to make us feel powerless over 
the BlackBerry’s pull: 
We’re always connected: We live in a world where we believe we must always 
be connected to friends, family and colleagues. 
Communication feels good: We like hearing from people, whether it’s through 
email, text messages, pictures, or some other method. Receiving 
communication from others makes us feel good. 
Checking messages make us feel important: It gives us a sense of increased self 
importance to have messages that require a response, especially if we know 
others can see us using our BlackBerry. 
We’re Always Connected 
The freedom to be anywhere—whether it’s a grocery store, a sporting event, 
golf course, pool, or anywhere else—and still instantly read and respond to 
important email or other message as if we were sitting at our desk. 
One potential reason for this need to continually check the flashing red light is 
that this is expectations we have set for responding quickly, anytime of the day 
or night. We are continually connected with our BlackBerry smartphones. We 
know it, and, everyone who knows us, knows it as well. We have created the 
situation—nobody else did this to us—and that’s important to remember. We 
use the BlackBerry, and we respond to the messages as soon as they arrive. 
Most of us hate to disappoint people, especially those we care about. This 
holds true for both our professional and personal contacts. If people want our 
attention, we want to be there for them. Our BlackBerry smartphones allow 
and encourage this behavior. The problem is that this becomes a self-
perpetuating problem. If we create a world in which we are always accessible, 
we are never off. 

5 
Communication Feels Good 
The second reason for our bad behavior of continually checking for that little 
red light is that we like hearing from people. It feels good to have business 
associates, colleagues, friends, and family reach out to us.  
When Gary was a kid, he would run to the mailbox as soon as the mail carrier 
would drop off the mail (OK, sometimes he still does this!). “Did anyone write to 
me today?” Gary would wonder to himself. When a letter came, there was great 
joy—even if the person who wrote wasn’t someone he was particularly fond of. 
If nothing came, he felt disappointed. 
When the light blinks, someone is communicating with us: we are not alone. 
Our BlackBerry smartphones bring us instant gratification by letting us know 
the instant someone wants us. 
■ Tip  Replying Quickly to Email can Be Addictive. 
“According to scientists, juggling e-mail, phone calls and other incoming information ... play to a 
primitive impulse to respond to immediate opportunities and threats. This stimulation provokes 
excitement – a dopamine squirt – that researchers say can be addictive. In its absence, people 
feel bored.”2

Turnar
 
 Can’t Leave Home Without It 
I recently had just driven one hour of a four-hour trip when I realized I 
had left my BlackBerry on the kitchen counter. I turned around and 
went back to get it without a second thought! 
—Oscar M., MadeSimpleLearning.com Customer 

7 
Checking Messages Makes Us Feel Important 
The third reason for continually checking that little light is perhaps the least 
flattering, but perhaps the most telling, if we’re honest: it makes us feel 
important. Have you ever found yourself sitting in the airport, on a bus or 
train, and the first thing you do is take out your BlackBerry to check email? 
What do you do if nothing is there? Do you pretend that you are doing 
something important? Do you do something—anything— to make it seem as 
though you are a somebody who needs to be continually connected? 
What fuels this need of ours? Well, there are lots of explanations, many of 
which are as diverse as our population. Freud would bring this all back to a 
discussion about our ego and id. The Dalai Lama would tie this into our desire 
to be happy. Feeling important gives us a sense of purpose, which in turn 
makes us feel useful and happy. 
 He Couldn’t Be Without It 
I was dating a man who had both a BlackBerry and phone. He lives in 
another state. When he would travel to town on business, he always 
had his “BlackBerry on Board.” 
We had been talking in a restaurant and, mid-sentence, he would 
reach for the vibration and start typing furiously with thumbs that 
shouldn’t be able to move that quickly. 
Once at the hotel, he would immediately plug it in and put it on a 
wood surface so that he could hear it without changing the ringer. It 
was the last thing he checked before turning in for the night and the 
first thing he checked in the morning after getting his glasses. If we 
left the room to go swimming, it was the first thing he looked at when 
returning to the room. 
—J. K.

For many years, BlackBerry smartphones were the property of the higher- ups
in the business and government world, the suits or execs. Those early adopters
always looked so darn important checking email, typing with their thumbs,
and  we wanted to be like them and have what they had. In recent years, the
explosion of BlackBerry smartphones has allowed many more people, even us
“non-higher-ups,” to get in on the BlackBerry world. Some of us like to display
our BlackBerry proudly on our belt, which might be telling the world: “I am
important.” 
Often, what is behind our own feeling of self-importance is really our own
insecurity. We look for validation from others to say: “That person is really
important!” We need to remember this quote: 
“We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don’t
care for.” 
—Marie Von Ebner-Eschenbach
(Austrian novelist, 1830-1916.) 
Truth be told, checking our BlackBerry constantly doesn’t make us look
important. It makes us look like a Geek who checks his or her BlackBerry too
much! 
Why the BlackBerry is So Addictive 
A research study conducted by MIT reported that almost all (90%) of
BlackBerry users in one company felt a compulsion to use their BlackBerry.
You can find that research study written up at this URL: 
www.cio.com/article/29081/Management_Report_BlackBerry_Addiction_
Starts_at_the_Top  
Such compulsion is characterized by a difficulty in refraining from checking
the device at regular intervals. It is interesting, but not surprising, that
compulsive behavior (i.e., CrackBerry addiction) affects an epidemic
proportion of BlackBerry smartphone users. However, it is surprising that few
users can offer substantive reasons why they feel compelled to constantly
check their device. Sure, they know they are doing it, but they do not stop to
think about it, nor do they realize why.

 BlackBerry On Bike 
I have rigged up my bike so that I can see my BlackBerry screen while 
I’m riding. My local superstore sells a package of black Velcro Fashion 
Trim—it comes four strips in a package. They are one inch by three 
feet. I cut about one foot off and wrapped it around the main bar. I 
leave the last three to four turns with a slight loop in them. These last 
three to four loops were not pulled tightly around the ones 
underneath it. This leaves a space that allows me to clip my 
BlackBerry holster belt clip through it. Another strip can be wrapped 
around the lower part of the BlackBerry and around the bar to secure 
it a little better…I do this whenever I ride. 
—Lenny M., MadeSimpleLearning.com Customer 
The three reasons we have proposed so far for “checking the little red light” 
have been largely psychological in nature. We are continually connected, we 
like to hear from people, and we like to feel important. If this were solely the 
case, it only makes sense that we should see all smartphones get an equal 
share of the blame for this gadget addiction phenomena, rather than just 
BlackBerry smartphones. And we do in fact see stories of addiction related to 
mobile gadgets other than the BlackBerry. However, there is something about 
the BlackBerry that arguably elicits more or this addictive compulsive 
behavior than occurs with other smartphone on the market.

 Eat, Sleep, and Dream BlackBerry 
I am afraid that I am really addicted to my BlackBerry. I manage the 
BlackBerry for my group, approximately 20 people. I eat, sleep and 
dream BlackBerry. I never shut mine off; it is on 24/7. And even when I 
get up in the middle of the night, the first thing I do is check my 
BlackBerry. I have had three models and I’m waiting for the new one 
to come out. I take my BlackBerry everywhere with me. Around here, I 
am known as the “BlackBerry Guru.” Thanks for listening. 
—Patricia M., MadeSimpleLearning.com Customer 
It is often said the best way to sell a BlackBerry is to give one to someone to 
use for a week. In other words, give them a taste. The BlackBerry is a tangible 
device, and RIM, more than any other manufacturer on the market, has hit the 
key physical ingredients that we believe give the BlackBerry its psychological 
CrackBerry reputation: Always On, Always Connected. 
■ Note  RIM has even registered the “Always On, Always Connected” phrase as a trademark 
with the US Patent and Trademark office. 
You don’t ever really turn your BlackBerry off. Once it boots up, it can run for 
months without ever having to be fully-powered off. 
■ Note  Even the pressing the Power key does not really turn off the device; rather, it puts the 
device into a Sleep mode, so it can be instantly brought back to life by a single touch of the 
same Power key. 
Pull a BlackBerry out of its holster, and the display is on. Drop it into its 
holster, and the display turns off. If you have it sitting beside you on the desk, 
and you see the red message notification light flashing, then you can hit any 
button, and the display will power up. This makes the BlackBerry extremely 
accessible. You never have to wait for it—it’s always ready for use.

 Cannot Resist—Busted! 
One night I was sitting in my living room reading a book. My 
BlackBerry was in its cradle in the kitchen, and my NASCAR alerts 
kept going off. I looked at my wife, and she looked at me and then I 
went back to reading my book. It kept on going off and I was dying. 
She said, “Are you going to answer that?” I said, “Nah... it’s no big 
deal.” Then my wife got up and left the room. I sat there for another 
minute or two, and finally I couldn’t stand it. 
I went to the kitchen, grabbed my BlackBerry, and started reading my 
alerts. I turned around, and when I did, my wife was standing right 
there with a big ole grin. I was busted!
—Ed H. 
It’s a One-Handed Device 
The BlackBerry has always been very much a one-handed device. While most 
users take a two-handed, two-thumbed “crackberry prayer” approach for 
typing out emails, basic use of the phone (navigation, using applications, and 
so on) is easily accomplished with one hand. With a trackball or trackpad in 
the middle of the phone, the Menu key to the left, and Escape/Back button to 
the right, you don’t need to move your thumb more than a half inch in any 
direction to have complete use of the phone. The same can’t be said for most 
of the other smartphones on the market today. The iPhone and Android 
phones require the use of two hands that move much farther than one-half 
inch, as do most other devices that rely on a touch screen. Because the 
BlackBerry is so easy to use one-handed, people are tempted to use it 
anywhere and everywhere. 
You can “get away” with using it during meetings, functions, and class 
because all that’s required is one eye on the screen and a little bit of thumb 
movement. It can be an inconspicuous device when you need it to be. 
Unfortunately, this one-handed ease-of-use also means that people use their 
BlackBerry while driving. (The authors strenuously recommend that you do 
not use your BlackBerry while driving any vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft.)

A growing number of US states are banning texting (sending text messages on 
your cell phones) while driving, and many articles you read about these bans 
will mention the BlackBerry somewhere in them.   
Instant Communication 
The BlackBerry has been designed to be the fastest communication tool. As 
such, it is second to no other device. We are all familiar with RIM’s push email 
technology, and it’s a given that the BlackBerry is quick to receive emails. 
More than that, it’s the speed with which a BlackBerry can be used to reply to 
that newly received message or send communication (e.g., email, text 
message, PIN message, or place a phone call) that is really impressive. 
Did you receive an email and need to respond? Pull your BlackBerry out of its 
holster and it will automatically turn on the display, open the email 
application, and display the new message. Zero clicks and no time wasted. 
Compare this to an iPhone, where you would have to power on, slide to 
unlock, tap once to open the email application, and tap again to view the 
inbox and the newly received message. We are talking about 15 seconds taken 
before you can even view the message received in the first place. If you 
observe BlackBerry users, you’ll notice they reach for the devices many, many 
times during the course of a day, but each interaction with the device is quite 
short. This isn’t a coincidence, but by design. Research in Motion’s philosophy 
is for the BlackBerry to be an on-the-go device. Studies have shown that you 
can literally add about an hour of productivity to your day by utilizing all of 
brief moments of downtime you have between activities. 
It Calls to You 
The blinking red light is addictive. You can turn it off, but nobody does. The 
blinking red light lets you know you have a new message of some sort waiting, 
whether it’s an email, missed call, text, PIN, or chat program message. Beyond 
the red light, you can customize your notification profiles for your BlackBerry. 
For example, you can make the phone vibrate when you receive a message 
when the device is in its holster or case. It’s hard to ignore the vibrations and 

13 
blinks of a BlackBerry, especially when you can check your message so 
quickly. 
The BlackBerry has crazy long battery life. You’ll rarely hear a BlackBerry user 
complain about battery life. The original BlackBerry 857/957 could run for two 
weeks or more without a charge, and the 72xx Series BlackBerry smartphones 
could literally run for days and days on a single charge. The newer BlackBerry 
models don’t have quite the same battery life; however, compared to other 
phones on the market, even the current devices are marathon runners. This 
means the BlackBerry can be relied on. You always know it’s going to be there, 
even at the end of the day or late at night—whenever  you need it. 
 Jet Ski and Fender Benders 
I have three BlackBerry smartphones in the bottom of Wolf Lake, and 
that’s not three berries that you might eat, that’s telephones from 
falling out of my Jet Ski. They’re gone. One of the most memorable 
experiences I have had was a fender bender with my Dodge pickup 
truck when trying to read the BlackBerry menu. I totaled one woman’s 
poor Sunbird car on a wet pavement day. 
I have your book: “BlackBerry Made Simple” on my desktop, a self-
help book downloaded off the Internet because the local cell phone 
dealership cannot answer my more difficult or advanced questions.

The Clikety-Clack of the Keyboard 
There is something satisfying about typing on the keyboard. The feel of the 
keys under our fingers, it gives us the sense of getting something done.   
Last, but certainly not least to mention is the famous BlackBerry keyboard. In 
a competitive smartphone marketplace where the current trend is toward big 
touchscreen devices, the physical keyboard is not only one of the key visible 
attributes that identifies a BlackBerry, but it’s one of the single biggest reasons 
people buy a BlackBerry and can’t give up their BlackBerry.  
In a recent poll on CrackBerry.com with over 20,000 respondents, 43% said 
they’ll never give up having a physical keyboard on their smartphone. Another 
35% said they much prefer having a physical keyboard compared to typing on 
glass. While there are BlackBerry device models that are full touchscreen, the 
physical keyboard has been a RIM staple prior to even BlackBerry being on the 
market.  

14 
Just recently RIM has introduced it’s first touch screen BlackBerry with a slide 
out keyboard, the Torch 9800.  It’s hard to get away from the keyboard – 
people love them so much and truly identify a BlackBerry by its keyboard. 
In the late 90s, the BlackBerry bucked the touchscreen trend already in use by 
devices like the Palm Pilot. While Palm was trying to perfect their stylus-based 
Graffiti method of data input, which converted handwriting into text, the RIM 
keyboard almost appeared to be a step backwards.  
Appearance and usage are different things, though, the full physical QWERTY 
keyboard was immediately embraced by anybody who picked up the device. 
Despite the small size of the buttons, typing on a physical keyboard proved 
easy and the tactile feedback of pushing buttons allowed for faster more 
accurate typing. It also allowed the user to build up muscle memory – just like 
typing on a computer keyboard after a while you don’t have to think about 
where the keys are.  
The success of the RIM/BlackBerry keyboard was so overwhelming that it even 
forced Palm to release a device featuring a full physical keyboard. Thanks to 
the speed and ease of typing provided by the BlackBerry keyboard, the ability 
to pound out a reply to a message so quickly has people doing just that -- 
anytime and everywhere – which unfortunately leads to BlackBerry Addiction. 
The Addiction 
No addiction starts overnight. It takes at least some time to form, although it’s 
surprising just how fast BlackBerry addiction can creep up. In the case of 
Vanessa, she was well aware of the BlackBerry smartphone’s addictive 
tendencies before she ever held one. One might think that this foresight would 
allow her to avoid the uncontrollable urge to reach for her BlackBerry. As 
“Vanessa’s Story” shows us, sometimes rational knowledge is useless when it 
comes to the irresistible draw of the BlackBerry. 
Vanessa’s Story 
My name is Vanessa and I’m a CrackBerry addict. Years ago I 
experienced what a lot of spouses are only experiencing now. My 
husband was one of the “pioneers” of BlackBerry addiction. I couldn’t 
understand his obsession with this phone. Most of all, I couldn’t 
understand what was so fascinating about a bulky phone with tiny, 
almost impossible-to-type keys. It was like he had just had a baby and 
all he could talk about and read about was BlackBerry. BlackBerry 
this, BlackBerry that! 

15 
He would make up a reason to go out, just so he could check his email 
without having his laptop in front of him. We would be out to dinner, 
and he would be constantly checking his email. If he wasn’t checking 
his email, he was telling me all about the great features of his device. 
Not exactly the best date you could have. 
All I wanted was to have a nice dinner with a real conversation that 
didn’t involve him typing or spinning a wheel. This black box was 
really getting on my nerves! 
Last year we had this really long drive, 12 hours in a car. My husband 
started the drive. At the beginning there was music and conversation, 
and then I realized the clock on the dashboard was broken. Oh no, my 
watch was broken too! Alas, actually we were both dying of boredom, 
and time seemed to be running in slow motion. That was when I first 
noticed that little light from the BlackBerry blinking at me. It kept 
calling my name and telling me: try me… try me… And just like that, 
my hands were wrapped around my biggest enemy of all time. And I 
started to become friends with my former nemesis. 
After a couple of minutes, I had figured out its powers, and I was on a 
roll! I was the queen of the World Wide Web. I was reading emails, 
sending emails, checking up on the weather, and looking at Google 
Maps. I didn’t want to let go of my new little friend. Meanwhile my 
husband kept saying that it was my turn to drive. But I knew that what 
he really meant was that it was his turn to use the BlackBerry. 
At the beginning of this year, I was on the phone with one of my best 
friends. She lives in Germany, and her husband had just started a new 
job and was awarded a BlackBerry. She complained how he kept 
staring at it all the time, how he couldn’t disconnect from it, and how 
he kept sending replies to his boss at 11pm on a Saturday night. It’s 
like the BlackBerry had become his mistress, and there was no space 
for her in his new world. And I had the most unexpected behavior. I 
started to defend him! And then it hit me! I had become one of them; I 
was a CrackBerry addict!

Vanessa’s story is not unique. The world is quickly becoming a country of 
email addicts. In the second quarter of 2010, the worldwide smartphone 
market grew at a 64 percent annual rate.  RIM’s shipment of BlackBerry 
smartphones grew at a rate of 41 percent annually.  And this is all happening 
during a global economic slow down.  There has to be something with these 
smartphones!   
Canalys estimates, http://www.canalys.com/pr/2010/r2010081.html   
An AOL survey discovered the extent to which we have made 24/7 access to 
email a must-have in our lives. While AOL’s survey is not exclusively about 
BlackBerry smartphones, at the time of the survey in 2008, the BlackBerry was 
the best known wireless email device. 
According to AOL’s third annual Email Addiction survey3, more Americans 
than ever before are using portable devices to keep tabs on their email 
throughout the day and night, and from virtually anywhere—from their bed, 
cars, bathrooms, and even church. 
83% of email users check their email on vacation, and increasing number of 
people plan the location of their getaways based on Internet access and 
wireless BlackBerry coverage. 
Some other statistics from the email survey are quite telling: 
•
59% of people emailing from portable devices are checking 
email in bed while in their pajamas. 
•
37% are checking email while they drive. 
•
12% admit to checking email in church. 
Visit any of the popular BlackBerry community websites, and you will discover 
so many of the tens of thousands of active BlackBerry users who frequent 
them that these statistics could well be understating things. CrackBerry.com 
just passed the 2.5 million member mark in mid-2010.  A phenominal growth 
rate in just a few short years.

In a poll at www.CrackBerry.com, more than 91% of respondents indicated they 
use their BlackBerry in the bathroom. Many respondents included comments 
like this one: “I think someone would be lying if they said they don’t take it 
with them!”

Many, many BlackBerry users even bring their device into the bathroom with 
them, often with catastrophic consequences. David Van Tongerloo, vice 
president of “The BlackBerry Repair Shop” in Houston, said that about 100 of 
the 500 damaged devices he receives a week have been dropped in the toilet. 
“We wear rubber gloves and masks when handling these devices,” he said. 
“We only do that for BlackBerry smartphones that were dropped in the toilet.”4

Reading the news on a BlackBerry in the bathroom has its benefits, according
to Stephen Sodoris, a professor of social work at the University of Maryland.
“The BlackBerry is a distraction technique for the millions of people who have
a shy-bladder or fear of going to the bathroom in public,” he said. 
Some BlackBerry owners are so reluctant to be without the device that they
will do almost anything to ensure they don’t have to ever part ways with it (see
the story, “BlackBerry During a Funeral”). 
 BlackBerry During a Funeral 
I recently dove deep into the ocean to retrieve my BlackBerry after
dropping it while fishing. Later, I stopped to look for it after my infant
daughter tossed it out of my car window on a freeway! My love for my
BlackBerry means I will do just about anything to protect it, but also
that I will use it anywhere I please, including the time I stood at my
father-in-law’s funeral, felt my BlackBerry vibrating in my pocket, and
the urge was too powerful to resist. Not only did I scroll through my
new messages during the service, but I responded, too. My addiction
stems from an obsession with reading and responding to email as
soon as it arrives. 
—John, CrackBerry.com Member
While BlackBerry addiction can cause all sorts of nuisances in a social context,
it becomes a greater concern when it puts people’s lives at risk, such as when
using your BlackBerry while driving (see Bell’s story in “Mercedes Crashed by
BlackBerry.” Bell’s accident occurred after only a single week with the device! 

19 
 
 BlackBerry Caused Mercedes Crash 
I have had my BlackBerry about a week, and have already had my first 
accident with it. I was driving and checking an email that just came in 
(stupid I know!) and ran my fiancé’s Mercedes into the car in front of 
me. I have not admitted to being on my phone at the time of the 
crash, but he knows. I guess that was my initiation. 
—Bell, CrackBerry.com Member 
Nobody was injured in this instance, and Bell says she has learned her lesson 
and will never use her BlackBerry while driving again. But using the 
BlackBerry when driving is a sure sign of the BlackBerry smartphone’s 
addictive grasp. An even stronger portrayal of BlackBerry addiction is painted 
by Sue’s recent recollection of a severe car accident, where the one thing on 
her mind wasn’t the physical condition of her husband or herself, but the 
location and condition of their BlackBerry smartphone (see the story, “We Hit 
a Stopped Truck at 60 MPH”). 

20 
 We Hit a Stopped Truck at 60 mph
On February 1st, 2008, I proudly walked out of the AT&T store after 
upgrading my Pearl to a Curve 8310. The next day, my husband and I 
were traveling out of town. Since he was driving, I used the time to set 
up my Curve. My Curve was in my hand, and my old Pearl, my 
husband’s Curve (which I had just bought him in December), and my 
BlackBerry 7290 (issued by my employer) were all in my lap. 
We were using TeleNav on my Curve for directions and were cruising 
down the road when I glanced up from my Curve to see a truck 
stopped in front of us. My husband yelled as we hit it at 60mph, 
flipped three times then slid upside down on the roof before stopping. 
We were upside down when we stopped moving, hanging by our 
seatbelts. When we were taken out of the car, I was in severe pain. 
As we were waiting to be air-lifted, people were gathering our 
personal belongings. I was screaming in pain and asked them to find 
my BlackBerry. And they brought one, and then another, and then 
another until they located all of them. I can’t imagine what they 
thought. When we arrived at the trauma unit, my left hand was black. 
They asked what was I doing when we crashed. My family all 
responded:  “Holding her BlackBerry!” (I had lost three units of blood 
internally and am still recovering.) 

21 
All our BlackBerry smartphones were ruined. The day I got out of the 
hospital, I went to AT&T to get new Curves. Since there was no 
insurance on them and we had just signed new two-year contracts, I 
could not get either of our BlackBerry smartphones replaced without 
paying full price. Even being on pain pills did not help the pain of 
losing my precious Curve. Since I could do nothing but lie in bed, I 
started calling AT&T daily, trying to get someone to help me. It was 
pure torture to be without my Curve by my side. Finally, one day I 
reached someone who said, “I can get you two Curves for $99 each 
and a $100 rebate if you agree to another two-year contract.” That 
was not a problem; for that price, I would have signed away my next 
grandchild! (Not really, but I would have considered it—briefly.) My 
Curve is once again forever by my side.

“Do I  
  Worship My 
  BlackBerry?” 
In this chapter, we’ll walk you through the second step in overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: admitting there are more important things in life than 
our BlackBerry. 
There really are things more important than that little smartphone from 
Canada.  Sometimes we just get caught up in our texting, emailing, BlackBerry 
Messenging, and checking facebook, so much that we lose sight of what is 
really important around us. 
In this chapter we will look at the dangers of worshiping our BlackBerry and 
try to shift focus onto those things in our lives that are even more important 
than the BlackBerry. 
The“BlackBerryPrayer”
Headbentdownslightly,
reverently,handsinlap,silently
typingaway.Quiet,focused,

24 
Step2:
BelieveinThingsMore
ImportantThanOurBlackBerry
Step 2: Believe in things more important than our BlackBerry. While we may 
buy our BlackBerry gifts (think: BlackBerry cases, accessories, apps, games and 
themes) and sometimes engage in BlackBerry worship, we must connect with 
something, such as those around us or a “higher power” to help restore our 
sanity. 
In other words, the second step in beginning to overcome our addiction is to 
begin to admit that there are things more important in life than our BlackBerry. 
The second step in the path to recovery is usually acknowledged to be the 
realization that there is something that we define as our “higher power.” For 
many, it is a belief in God. For others, it transcends the traditional notion of a 
deity or is even more obtuse. For too many of us, this step on the journey 
requires us to take a leap of faith that we are unwilling to commit to. 
 

25 
 Almost Hit by Bus for BlackBerry 
I was walking across a busy city street during lunchtime and dropped 
my BlackBerry. Yes, I dashed out and picked it up, without thinking. I 
swear that Metro bus just missed me! 
—Chandra N. 
 
For BlackBerry users and abusers, the issue is both crystal clear and intensely 
complicated at the same time: we worship our BlackBerry smartphones. And 
we demonstrate our worship of these little messaging devices in several ways: 
•
We pay complete attention to our BlackBerry, sometimes 
ignoring everything and everyone else around us. 
•
We show them adoration and shower them with gifts. 
•
We long for them and feel more “complete” when they are 
by our side. 
•
We ask things of them—sometimes, we even beg them to 
help us. 
We like to think of ourselves as people who love human beings. We might say: 
“I love my spouse and my kids and my family and friends. I love time spent 
with those who are important to me. I hate to admit it, but I also love my 
BlackBerry.” 
We, the authors, really love these devices. And my guess is, so do most of you 
reading this book. Why do we have such adoration for this small hunk of 
metal, plastic, and computer components? We love it for all the things we 
believe it does for us. There is no truer indication of this than the fact we turn 
to our BlackBerry when we are in need: 
•
When we need to reach out and communicate in a hurry – to 
whom or what do we turn? To our BlackBerry. 
•
When we need to find out the weather in Chicago before we 
get on the plane, where do we turn? To our BlackBerry. 
•
When we need to know how the Red Sox are doing, where do 
we turn? You know where. 

26 
Weturntoour
BlackBerrywhenwe
areinneed.
We must check email, enter text, or search for something on our BlackBerry at 
least 50 times a day. It is the crutch upon which we lean for many things that 
we deem to be important. 
How do we show adoration for those things that we rely on? One way is to 
shower them with gifts. In Biblical times, the ancient Israelites offered 
sacrifices to their God. As history moved on, sacrifices were replaced by prayer 
and other offerings still in use today. It is human nature to bestow gifts upon 
those we love and, yes, upon those we worship. 
Ihave5casesto protect
myBlackBerryfromthe
cruelworld.
Gary muses about how he protects his BlackBerry:  
My BlackBerry can be protected from the horrors of our cruel world by 
one of no less than five protective cases I’ve purchased for it. I didn’t 
purchase these protective devices for me—I bought them for my 
BlackBerry, to care for it. I can dress it up in leather if I take it out on 
the town, and I can protect it in armor if I need to risk its very being 
out in the world. If I go to the beach, it can be sealed in a hardened, 
plastic, waterproof case, so no harm befalls it. 
Also, I want it to look good at all times, so I “dress it up” with themes, 
wallpaper, and other things. I buy these things so it can look its best. I 
know that my BlackBerry doesn’t want to look like everyone else’s. 
Mine craves a sense of style and individuality! It communicates with 
me on that very deep level, so I take care of its every need. 

27 
Like all things we worship, we enter into a bargaining agreement with our 
BlackBerry. The healthier relationships between humanity and the higher 
power look at covenantal relationships (contracts between the parties); these 
contracts express obligations and expectations. So, I provide for and take care 
of my BlackBerry. In return, it will always be there for me. It will fetch my 
email when I want it, connect and not drop calls, keep my data safe, entertain 
me when I am lonely, and always wink at me with affection when my email 
comes in. 
Iprovideforandtakecare
ofmyBlackBerryanditwill
alwaysbethere forme.
The second way we show that we show we worship our BlackBerry devices: We 
long for them and feel more complete when our device is by our side. Gary’s 
good friend Steve recently converted to using a BlackBerry instead of a 
Windows Mobile phone. He has quickly become, not only a BlackBerry user, 
but also a BlackBerry abuser—so much so that he went into a panic last year 
when he couldn’t find his new best friend. 
He was lost when his BlackBerry was lost—incomplete until it was once again 
by his side. Indeed, he did what any good BlackBerry user and abuser would 
do: he went online and purchased a BlackBerry locator program. Once he 
located it, he made a vow that he would never lose his companion again.

How many times have we walked out of our homes and offices, jumped into
our cars, and then realized that we left our BlackBerry behind, alone, to face
the challenges of the world unprotected by us, its caretaker. What do most of
us do when this happens? Kevin states: “I know that, when this has happened
to me (and I am ashamed to admit it has happened more than once), I have
run right back to where I was to retrieve my BlackBerry. I owe my device that
much, at least.” 
 Driving 30 Minutes to Retrieve My
BlackBerry
I’m in trouble here, just cant get enough!  Just today I realized, when I
was at my desk I forgot my phone at home. I quickly decided to leave
work and drive the 30 minutes to get home to get it.   
Before my BlackBerry, I never would have done that, I would have
used my office phone, or emailed from my computer to tell friends
that I’m sans phone. Nope, not now, I went all the way home to get my
BlackBerry.

How often do you check to make sure your BlackBerry is nearby? How many
times do you feel your belt or pocket or purse, even when you know you have
your BlackBerry with you? We all do it; it becomes our security blanket. 
There are many reasons why our BlackBerry gives us a sense of security; we
spoke of some of these in Chapter 1. Whatever the reason, the driving force is
the same. We feel better and more complete when we are tethered to our
BlackBerry at all times. And we do mean at all times. Later in this book, we will
look at stories and situations where keeping your BlackBerry by your side
everywhere you go can lead to disaster. 
The third way we show that we worship our BlackBerry is that we ask things of
it. For example, sometimes we beg our BlackBerry to help us. Have you ever
caught yourself talking to your BlackBerry? “Come on, please! Don’t crap out
on me now! Please connect… please connect.” Or perhaps you have said: “Just
this one time. I have to send this email. Just give me a connection for a couple
of seconds, and I won’t ask anything more of you.” 
No doubt you have also seen the following on the train, in the airport, or at
lunch. Frantic people (executives, young people, middle-aged people, anyone)
will shake the BlackBerry, and curse, pray, and beg for the hour glass to
disappear or for the connection to get magically stronger. 

29 
And what happens when our prayers are answered? Smiles, tears, and praises 
of thanksgiving.  
We have all said, “Thank you, Thank you!” on more than one occasion when 
our BlackBerry finally did what we begged of it.  We don’t really stop to 
imagine what a non-BlackBerry user might think of one of us in that situation.  
WorshipingourBlackBerryis
trulyasignofour
dependency.
This behavior, this worship of our devices, is truly a sign of our dependency. 
We need to see this for what it is, and we need to acknowledge that it exists. 
Only when we take the steps of admitting our behavior and acknowledging 
that we do sometimes worship our BlackBerry can we begin to walk along the 
path towards becoming untethered, thereby freeing ourselves up for the 
things that are truly more important in our lives (see the story, “Worshiping 
My BlackBerry Is Caused by My Obsession with People”). 

30 
 Worshiping My BlackBerry Is Caused by My 
Obsession with People 
Hmm, I’m scared to even post my story because I’d like to think of 
myself as somewhat “normal”, and by sharing my feelings towards my 
BlackBerry publicly will only save them for posterity. But here goes... (I 
figure that if even one person out there nods her head when reading 
my story, with a deep feeling of empathy and understanding, then 
posting is worth it!) 
It’s not that I have one instance of obsession. But every minute of 
every waking hour seems to be some homage to my addiction. Let’s 
see... do others find yourselves just holding your BlackBerry of choice, 
and then, without even pressing down, just finding your thumbs 
always absently scrolling your trackball? Does you find the feeling of 
the rolling the trackball underneath your thumbs a strange comfort? 
Does you sometimes fidget with your BlackBerry, re-reading 
messages and texts that you read before for no apparent reason, but 
just to be interacting with the thing? 
Is your BlackBerry first thing you look at in the morning, and the last 
thing you see before bed? Do you wake up in the middle of the night 
(maybe a dream woke you up, who knows?) and find that your first 
instinct is to look for a red blinking thing on your bedside table? Is any 
of this sounding familiar? 
I sit at work on my computer, and I probably glance at my BlackBerry 
at least once every few minutes. Even if there are no messages 
blinking, I still press a button to see the screen come alive and to 
admire the menu...  
I ponder sometimes what exactly it is about this thing that I so adore. 
I'd like to think that I functioned perfectly well before I purchased my 
first BlackBerry (this is my third). My friend asked me last week (she 
has no interest in BlackBerry smartphones or smartphones of any 
sort) what it is exactly that I love so much about my BlackBerry. I had 
a flood of reasons come to my mind, such as the cute form factor, the 
unbelievable reliability of the device, the push email, and so on. But in 
trying to pinpoint the most poignant reason, I kinda became quiet. I 
actually needed a moment to give her a really honest response. 

31 
I said to her: “You know, Laura, I think the reason why I love my 
BlackBerry so much is because, ever since I’ve gotten this thing, it’s 
made it so much easier to keep in touch with all of the people that I 
care about the most.” And that’s the truth. At the end of the day, what 
does my BlackBerry do for me? It keeps me in perfect contact, 
whether through lightning-fast emails, texts (made more pleasurable 
by the Curve’s awesome keyboard), Messenger, or through PIN #’s 
with the people most important to me—my family and friends. 
So I guess when I say that I’m addicted to my BlackBerry, it’s another 
way of saying that I’m addicted to my people! Ha ha ha! 
Cheers everyone, and cherish your BlackBerry!

All this being said—and most of it is true—we do need to bear in mind Step 2 
on the path towards BlackBerry recovery: Believe in things more important 
than our BlackBerry. 
We may find it hard to grasp what, or more importantly, who, is more 
important than our BlackBerry. We will come to understand this better as we 
progress through the steps outlined in this book.

“Step Away 
  from the 
  BlackBerry” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 3 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: learning to occasionally live without your BlackBerry. 
“Resistance is futile”

34 
Step3:
BegintoTurnAway
fromBlackBerryAbuse
Step 3: Begin to turn away from BlackBerry abuse. We resolve to begin 
occasionally turning our will and our lives over to the power of being 
BlackBerryless. 
In other words, the third step in overcoming our addiction is to 
begin to take short breaks from our BlackBerry. 
Along our path away from the abuse of our BlackBerry smartphones, we come 
to our third chapter in this book. The third step in the traditional path of 
recovery is to turn our lives and our will over to a higher power. We suggest that 
Step 3 towards BlackBerry recovery is to step away from our BlackBerry for a bit.  
Doing so lets us free ourselves from the shackles that enslave us and remember 
what it is that gives meaning to our lives. 
■ Caution  Exercising while checking Email is not Relaxing. 
Recent studies have shown that the constant interruption of reading and replying to email or 
otherwise multitasking while you exercise can be more fatiguing than relaxing. According to Mark 
Berman, a University of Michigan neuroscientist, “People think they're refreshing themselves [by 
exercise], but they're fatiguing themselves.”1 
For some, this might mean connecting with our higher power. For others, it 
might mean re-connecting with our spouse or partner. And for others, it might 
just mean enjoying time with our kids or enjoying the great outdoors. There is 
life beyond our BlackBerry; we just have to let ourselves find it.

 Cannot Turn It Off 
I turned my BlackBerry off for hours at a time only to turn it back on 
and find text and email messages. I now keep it on vibrate even at the 
movies.
—Lenny M. 
Almost every 6 months, I say that’s it. To save my sanity and my 
marriage, I will put it away. I stop the data portion and use it as a 
phone and agenda only. That lasts for exactly two days! 
—Jonathan D.
I’ve even turned my BlackBerry off only to find myself kinda accidently 
turning it back on and then just leaving it on. 
—Oscar M. 
I have sleeping problems, and I often find myself picking up my 
BlackBerry throughout the night. Then, I tell myself I need to put it 
down and try to sleep.

Gary’s wife Gloria recently challenged him to go out of town with her and 
leave his BlackBerry behind. She didn’t think he could do this. And, at the time 
of updating this second edition of the CrackBerry book, two years later, he has 
yet to do it. However, she really pushed him to just go away with her and not 
take the added stress and work with him. 
Of course, Gary balked at the mere mention of this idea:  
Said Gary: “I have to take my BlackBerry; what if my kids need me? Or, what if 
one of my students has to get in touch with me? Or my business parter needs 
me to follow up on something?” 

36 
The excuses he gave illustrate the main reasons why we are so reluctant to step 
away from our BlackBerry smartphones for an extended period of time: 
•
We are afraid to leave it behind: Our fear comes in many 
shapes and sizes, but it can be paralyzing. We are afraid 
to journey too far without our BlackBerry. 
•
We fear we may learn we aren’t really indispensible: 
Much of our self-worth is tied into the things we do, and 
it’s comforting to think we are so important that others 
can’t live without us. It would be sobering to learn others 
don’t really need us. 
•
We fear we won’t know what to do if we don’t have our 
BlackBerry to check email, news updates, weather, and 
the like: We are creatures of habit, and breaking that 
mold is not easy. 
Fear keeps us from doing many things in our lives. Sometimes, healthy fear 
actually drives us to pursue our dreams and hopes, but sometimes fear can be 
paralyzing. We have all heard the famous cliché: “There is nothing to fear, but 
fear itself.” Yet, everyone has fears. The question at hand for us is:  
What is it that the BlackBerry user fears about being away from 
his or her BlackBerry? 
One answer is something we touched on in Chapter 1. We like to be in touch, 
and we like to feel needed. When that little red light goes off or the holster 
vibrates, we know that someone is looking for us, and that can be affirming (or 
comforting). We have a fear of not being wanted or needed. 
Most of us have a very basic desire to be needed by others. Having our loved 
ones depend on us is not a burden, so much as it is something that provides 
meaning to the very fabric of our existence. 
“The entire sum of existence is the magic of being needed by just one 
person.”
—V.I. Putnam 
When we are connected through our BlackBerry smartphones, we feel needed 
and thus, fulfilled. If we leave our BlackBerry behind, then it’s possible we’ll 
discover that the world really can go on without us being in constant contact. 
This leads us to the second reason we are reluctant to leave our BlackBerry 
smartphones behind: maybe we really aren’t indispensible after all. This 
certainly builds upon what we just stated before; life can (and will) go on 
without us. The important thing for us to realize is that we can go on without 
the day-to-day hustle-and-bustle of BlackBerry-tethered life, too—for a little 
while, anyway. 

37 
Nobody is indispensible. Even the President has a Vice President—just in case. 
Our co-workers, friends, and business associates will survive if we are out of 
touch for a few hours or even a few days. Essentially, this, too, relates to fear. 
We are afraid that we can be replaced, forgotten, or just not needed. 
So, the answer is that we just have to get over ourselves. We are not that 
important or indispensible—no one is. Life will wait for us to return; it won’t 
bypass us just because our BlackBerry is at home. Keep this in mind! 
Finally, we are creatures of habit, and we don’t like change. Few people do. 
Now, some people are more adventurous than others, but the third reason for 
our reluctance to step away from the BlackBerry and see the higher powers in 
our world is that we don’t know what to do when we aren’t on the device. 
 
 BlackBerry in Shower 
I’m guilty of using my BlackBerry just 
about everywhere. But my main 
confession is ’Berrying in the shower. I 
actually keep a Ziploc bag in the 
bathroom, just so I can do this. I know: 
I’m pathetic. And you know what: I don’t 
care. LOL! I’m addicted and not looking 
for a cure!

Change is all about fear (funny how this all connects, isn’t it?). We are afraid to 
find out what we must do if our BlackBerry is not with us. So, here is the task 
for all BlackBerry abusers: take the plunge, conquer the fear, and just put it 
down, if only for a little bit. Go ahead: try 15 minutes first, then move on to 30 
minutes, and even longer time periods. You may feel liberated and free.

 The World Stops Without My BlackBerry 
I know I am a CrackBerry addict because, when I see someone else
with a BlackBerry, I smile at them. I do this because I know they have
the same addiction. Every morning when I wake up, the first thing I
reach for under my pillow is my BlackBerry. I check how many emails I
have in the four hours since I put it down to sleep. 
After I finish getting ready for work, I am walking to the bus stop,
checking the news for the morning on my ’Berry. Once I get on the
bus, I watch one or two videos from YouTube that I downloaded the
previous night. Then, after I get off the bus to transfer to the train, I
start jammin’ to my music while responding to my emails. When I
reach the office, I send a BlackBerry message to my wife that I’ve
arrived at work safely without crashing into a door. [Editor’s Note: A
BlackBerry message is sent from the BlackBerry Messenger instant
messaging (IM) application.] 
Upon arriving to work, I buy a cup of coffee, and I check www.digg.com
for the latest news. By midday, I am sharing jokes with friends
through email or Google chat and surfing www.CrackBerry.com’s blogs
and forums for the latest news about BlackBerry. 
When it’s time to leave work, I give my ’Berry a little charge to make
sure it’s full, in case there’s a train delay. While on the train home, I
make sure that I check Viigo for the latest news through its RSS feed,
and I tag the ones that I want to read before I go to bed [Editor’s Note:
Viigo is an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Newsreader for the
BlackBerry].
Right before I go to bed, I blog on my BlackBerry and send it out as a
general email. Finally, I slip it under my pillow, so I can feel it vibrate if
someone responds to me. 
I am a BlackBerry Addict. 
I must have it with me or the world stops.

Of course, some of us find it frightening to be without our BlackBerry, even for 
a short while (see the story, “Fear of Losing My BlackBerry”). 
 Fear of Losing My BlackBerry 
I must start by setting the stage of this story. We all know how the 
winters up here in Canada are; let’s just say white. During early 
spring, we have the inevitable melt, where everything gets excessively 
wet and puddly. It was at this time of year when a simple and normal 
act turned into a tragic and terrible night. 
I am, as most BlackBerry users will understand, a quick-draw user. I 
never have my BlackBerry much farther than an arm’s length away. 
My BlackBerry sits on my right hip, in various holsters and pouches. 
So one night I was heading out to grab a bite to eat. I nonchalantly 
walked out to my car, opened the door, and stepped over the large 
puddle that I parked on. And there it went: crack, splash! My beloved 
’Berry was in the water, face down. I picked it up as quickly as I could, 
sacrificing the dryness of my foot and knee as I instinctively knelt 
down in the middle of the puddle. I pulled it out of the holster. And, as 
if to taunt me, the screen flickered, showed the hour glass, and went 
black. I quickly pulled the battery out and took it inside. Pacing around 
my kitchen, I pondered what my next step would be to save it. I had a 
bottle of distilled water for use in various automotive applications, so I 
doused it in the water to rinse off any road salt, and then I stuck it 
under a hair dryer on low for a few minutes. 
A couple of days later, I decided to risk the first power on since the 
swim. To my surprise, it turned on and booted up to the Home screen. 
I went to run through the menu, but every single key failed to work, 
and the trackwheel did nothing. I was devastated. I felt like I had just 
broken up with a girlfriend; more shockingly, I felt like I’d been 
dumped. I would search for it, long for it. 
My days were spent trying to figure out how to text message without 
a full keyboard (QWERTY) keypad. I was chained to my desk, and 
every email was a chore to read. I was going through serious 
withdrawal. I went for about three days before I couldn’t take using a 
boring old cell phone, and I went out and got a new BlackBerry. I love 
it. And it has been a match made in heaven ever since. 

40 
To anyone who has lost his BlackBerry to a tragedy such as this, there 
is a light at the end of the tunnel. 
—Kieran, CrackBerry.com Member 
As sad as some of these stories are, perhaps what is sadder is that many 
readers of this book can truly relate. We are attached to our beloved 
BlackBerry smartphones. We don’t want to be away from them, even for a 
minute. 
Here is something to think about: Most of us long-time BlackBerry owners 
may have experienced a memory leak on our older devices. When this 
happens, the hour glass just turns and turns, and the BlackBerry has 0 bytes of 
free memory. The solution to this problem is to give the BlackBerry a break 
and do a battery pull, where you just open the back, take out the battery, let 
the device rest, and then put the battery back in. When the ’Berry powers up, 
its memory is restored. 
Maybe the same can be said for us. Maybe when we use the BlackBerry too 
much, we get our own memory leak and forget about those more important 
things in life. So, take some time, step away from the BlackBerry, and let your 
mind reboot from time to time, as well!

“BlackBerry 
  Boo-Boos” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 4 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: facing your faux pas and resolving to do better.  We will 
guide you through a “moral inventory” of BlackBerry use and abuse. And also, 
we will look at how your BlackBerry abuse has hurt those around you so we 
can begin to walk a path towards responsible BlackBerry use. 
 

42 
Step4:
TakeaMoralInventoryof
OurBlackBerryAbuses
Step 4: Take a moral inventory of our BlackBerry abuses. We create a general 
list of those times we behaved poorly or even in a way that was dangerous to 
those around us. 
In other words, the fourth step requires that we take a moral inventory of those 
times when our BlackBerry use caused harm to those around us. 
Congratulations! You are making progress. You didn’t throw this book away or 
put it up for sale on Ebay (not yet, anyway!) By now, you know you might have 
a problem. You are a BlackBerry overuser and maybe even a BlackBerry 
abuser. Don’t fret; we are walking you through a process here. This process 
will help you restore some meaning to your life and allow you to live 
untethered from your BlackBerry, at least for short stretches at a time. 
Along the path of recovery, the fourth phase or step is to search your soul and 
take a moral inventory. We’ll wait while you do this... OK, you are in trouble, 
aren’t you? Taking a moral inventory of our BlackBerry use means that we 
have to reflect on the times we were rude, thoughtless, unkind, selfish, and 
reckless for the sake of our BlackBerry use. 
The BlackBerry Alphabetic Acrostic 
On the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur (AKA, the Day of Atonement), Jews 
recite an alphabetical acrostic of sins they have committed during the year. 
Performing this recitation sort of frees and cleanses them. We wonder what our 
BlackBerry alphabetical acrostic of sins might look like. We were all of the 
following: 
•
Arrogant in our email use. 
•
Boasted about our new BlackBerry. 
•
Caustic in our messaging. 
•
Diabolical in checking email under the table.  
•
Exclusive in only being nice to other BlackBerry users. 

43 
•
Fraudulent when we said, “Honey, no, I wasn’t checking 
email.”  
•
Giddy when the new ’Berry showed up.  
•
Haughty when we upgraded to BlackBerry 6.0 and our 
friends were stuck on 5.0. 
•
Idolatrous in our worshiping our BlackBerry. 
•
Jealous when the guy on the train had a signal, and we 
didn’t. 
•
Kissed our BlackBerry when we thought we had lost it. 
•
Lusted after the newest models. 
•
Malicious when we had to call tech support. 
•
Narrow Minded in our views of Android and iPhone users. 
•
Obstinate in our defending the BlackBerry at all costs. 
•
Punitive when we found someone who still was on a Palm. 
•
Querulous while talking on the BlackBerry. 
•
Removed from family life due to BlackBerry overuse. 
•
Stealthy and Sneaky in checking email. 
•
Treacherous to others in our car and on the road. 
•
Used other people’s Wi-Fi—because we could. 
•
Violated basic rules of etiquette more than once with our 
devices.  
•
Worried more about our email going through than other, more 
important things. 
•
Xenophobic of those using a different operating system on 
their handheld. 
•
Yelled at our kids because they dropped our beloved 
BlackBerry. 
•
Zealous with our BlackBerry-related spending this past year. 
Our BlackBerry boo-boos are an alphabet of woe! 
We have all done something rude or inappropriate with our BlackBerry at 
some point. It can be as innocuous as not turning the profile to vibrate at the 
movies or as rude as texting during services at a wedding or a funeral. The list 
of possibilities is endless, and you will read some stories from the worst 
offenders later in this chapter.

 BlackBerry Football Instead of Dancing 
with the Wife 
One Saturday evening a few weeks ago, my wife and I were guests at 
a wedding reception. We sat at the same table with our very close 
friends, Larry and Dara. Larry and I are avid football fans of a 
particular college. That college was playing a football game the same 
night as the wedding reception, so we couldn’t watch or attend the 
game.
The next best option was to get updates of the game during the 
reception on my friend’s BlackBerry. So, for most of the party, Larry 
and I passed his BlackBerry back and forth to get play-by-play 
updates, when we should have been enjoying our wives’ company, 
dancing, and being sociable. 
We would even interrupt the conversation to tell each other when big 
plays occurred. When I arrived home after the reception, I found out 
very quickly from my wife that she was very unhappy about my 
evening’s addiction to the college football game updates on the 
BlackBerry.
The next morning at church, I shared with Larry how I got in trouble 
for watching the BlackBerry at the reception. Larry said, “I got in 
trouble too!” 
—Ed P., an Accountant in Florida 
The question we have to ask ourselves is this: “Why are we rude with our 
BlackBerry smartphones?” 
We all know basic etiquette. We know what we won’t tolerate in others, so why 
do we tolerate and justify these actions when we do them? Maybe we are just 
addicted to college football, and the BlackBerry is just a means to an end. 
A psychologist might tell us that this is a classic sign of addiction: justiying 
behavior in ourselves that we would not tolerate from others. Our parents 
would just say we were being selfish and rude. It could be both. 

45 
There are a few possible reasons as to why so many of us commit BlackBerry 
boo-boos: 
•
We truly can’t help ourselves (this is why we need this book). 
•
We aren’t even aware of what we are doing because we are 
so focused on the BlackBerry. 
•
We somehow think that rules of common decency and 
etiquette don’t apply to us. 
•
We believe that the BlackBerry is so unique and special that 
there no rules that should apply when we use it. 
If we can’t help ourselves, then we do need some sort of help to gain control 
over our BlackBerry use. We need to ask ourselves if this kind of behavior is in 
response to our BlackBerry usage, or if it extends to other areas of our lives. 
Once we make this determination, we can begin to formulate a plan to address 
our behavior. 
If you are someone who feels that the laws of common decency don’t apply to 
you, please do the following:  
1.
Place your BlackBerry in your freezer for about an hour. 
2.
Remove it from the freezer. 
3.
Place your BlackBerry between your thumb and forefinger. 
4.
Finally, please hit yourself in the head with your now frozen BlackBerry 
as hard as you can—you deserve it! 
There is nothing—repeat nothing—that makes you superior because you have 
the latest and coolest smartphone on the market. As cool as the BlackBerry is, 
you still have to function on planet earth with all the rules of etiquette and 
decency that apply to everyone else. 
If you believe that “the BlackBerry is so unique and special that no rules 
should apply”— well, you may be correct, but please re-read the freezer 
suggestion just oulined. One thing is certain: There are others in this world 
who are worse than you when it comes to BlackBerry abuse. Just read on to see 
how bad things could get if you don’t attempt to change your behavior! 

46 
 Embarrassing Ringtone! 
For fun, I downloaded and installed an alert on my BlackBerry Pearl 
that plays the sound of a woman in ecstasy at the peak of sexual 
response. The alert would activate, “Ooooooooh! Ahhhh! Ohhh! Oh 
Yes! YES! YES!” each time I received a text message or an email. It 
was controversial and fun, and I enjoyed the attention my alert tone 
received from my friends. 
There’s a time and a place for everything, however. Professionally, I 
teach psychology at a small, private college. During class, I religiously 
turn off my BlackBerry; or at least, I reduce the sound and revert to 
vibration mode. But I forgot to do this on a particularly important day. 
It was the first class of Winter semester, and every seat in the 
classroom was taken by new students. Part of my lecture and 
introduction to new students is to review the rules of cell phone 
usage. This helps to manage the noise level and reduce the number of 
interruptions. The first rule, of course, is that cell phones should be 
turned to either the off or vibrate position. 
I had just made my points to all and was feeling pretty proud that I 
had their full attention and compliance. That didn’t last very long. 
Within moments, the sound of sex emitted from my BlackBerry in its 

47 
hip holster. The setting was on Loud and all in the room heard it: 
“Oooooooh! Ahhhh! Ohhh! Oh Yes! YES! YES!” 
I fumbled for the phone to turn it off and explained to the class, “This 
is a demonstration of what not to do in my class!” 
—Doreen, Psychology Professor 
So far we have made a moral inventory of our BlackBerry use and abuse. All of 
us probably find ourselves lacking in some way. Maybe we are even saddened 
and embarrassed by the reality of our rude and selfish behavior. Keep reading. 
In the rest of this chapter, we’ll cover strategies that will help you restore order 
to your life and curb your bad BlackBerry behavior. 
See my addiction, my attachment to....my BlackBerry. 
I'm posting this while sitting, waiting in a sushi bar downtown... 
I came out here to have a few sushi rolls for lunch with my girlfriend. 
When we finished eating and received the check, I found that my 
pockets were empty. None of the usual items I carry were on my 
person. No chapstick, no change, no credit cards, no I.D., NO MONEY! 
I left them all at home! I remember setting those things aside before 
taking a shower to go out to eat. So, I sent my girlfriend home to get 
my money to pay for the meal. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here in the 
restaurant with the one thing I didn’t forget - "I never leave home 
without it." Can you guess what that is?

“Am I a 
  BlackBerry 
  Abuser?” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 5 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: analyizing the user quiz we will take in this chapter and 
admitting to our specific BlackBerry abuses. 
Step5:
AdmittoOurSpecific
BlackBerryAbuses
Step 5: Admit to our specific BlackBerry abuses. We will take the Addiction 
quiz and confess to our specific list of BlackBerry abuses. Then , we will share 
this confession with the universe, ourselves, and another human. 
In other words, we use Step 5 to admit to ourselves and others that we have 
been, and are, BlackBerry abusers.  

50 
Up until this point in the book, we have examined our behavior and shared 
stories that maybe made us laugh. Some of the stories and anecdotes might 
have struck a chord, while others might have struck a little too close to home. 
Chances are, you would not be reading this book unless, in some way, you or 
someone you love thought you might in fact be a BlackBerry over-user or 
abuser. 
While there is no hard and fast empirical method to determine who is a 
BlackBerry abuser, there are some ways that we can begin to diagnose our 
behavior and help us learn whether we are in the at-risk group for BlackBerry 
abuse. 
“Ihaveonefriendwhodoesnot
havea‘Berry.Iofferedtobuyhim
onejustsoitwouldmakemylife
easierifhehadone.”
Source:Chad,CrackBerry.comMember
Certainly, one determining factor is the perception of others. How many times 
in a day does someone say to you, “Are you on that thing again?” Or, “Can you 
go five minutes without checking that?” 
Do you take your BlackBerry to bed? When you wake up in the morning, do 
you first kiss your spouse first—or check your email? How long can you go 
without seeing whether you have new email? 
Our guess is that your answers to the questions just asked will give you some 
indication as to whether you are in the at-risk group for being considered a 
BlackBerry abuser. 
One of our goals with this book is to collect some empirical data or at least give 
users some true objective criteria for determining whether they are in need of 
BlackBerry rehab. On the following pages, you’ll find a BlackBerry Use and 
Abuse quiz. We would like you to take this quiz to help determine your 
BlackBerry abuse status. Remember, honest answers are needed; you aren’t 
showing this to anyone but yourself, right? So, what would it say about you if 
you lied on a test that was only meant for your own personal edification?

helpful to you. One thing to be aware of is that BlackBerry addiction is a 
slippery slope; you may say Yes to only a few questions today, but it’s quite 
possible that the number will grow substantially in a few weeks. The longer 
you use your device, the more likely your list is to grow. 
 
I had 11 "yes" responses, making me "Strongly Addicted". 
I knew I was addicted long before this quiz came out, though. I was 
once in the bathroom at work, thumb typing away on BBM with a 
close friend, when I heard the door open and someone enter the stall 
next to me. To my utter chagrin, it was one of my coworkers that 
knows me well. The conversation went like this: 
Coworker: Oh my God, Tina, is that you? Me: Uh, yes. Hi. Coworker: 
Are you typing on your Blackberry? Me (now breaking out into an 
embarrassed sweat): Uh, yes. I was. Coworker: I come in here to do 
that all the time too! Both of us just laughed at that point. 
Needless to say, I am not the only Blackberry addict in my office, 
though I've got it bad!

 Sneaking Away from Groups 
I usually sneak away, but it usually involves an excuse such as, “I have 
to use the restroom.” 
—Helen Ann R. 
After I return from sneaking off, I see everyone smiling when I return 
to the group holding my BlackBerry. 
—Lenny M. 
Sometimes when I’m on vacation, I try to distance myself from my 
lady friend, so she does not know I checked in at my office while on 
vacation. I don’t always want her to know my mind is at work again. 
—Duane S. 
Sometimes I sneak away. Usually I don’t mind using it in front of other 
people, but when dining (people close to me get easily irritated at the 
amount of attention it gets), I will place it on my lap and use it under 
the tabletop.

Cash Penalties for 
Use in a Meeting 
My Sales Manager has implemented a 
new rule: if she catches us on our 
BlackBerry smartphones during a 
Sales meeting, we have to pay $10 per 
occurrence! Needless to say, we have 
quite a bit of money in our BlackBerry 
fund. We have not decided what these 
funds will be used for, but at the rate 
it is going, we will be able to throw an

 Kevin’s Comments on the Addiction Quiz 
When I took this quiz, I basically said Yes to everything except question 
27: I didn’t feel hopeless about my BlackBerry use because I felt it was 
something I had control over. To some extent, I do have that control. 
However, one thing I have noticed from working on this book is that I 
now suffer from a self-induced case of ADD (attention deficit disorder), 
and I think my BlackBerry is to blame. There was a time when I liked 
nothing better than to sit down and focus on a long task from start to 
finish because I found it a rewarding experience. Now, thanks to the 
BlackBerry, I live my life a few minutes at a time—the time between 
checking messages and new notifications on my BlackBerry. I’ve become 
extremely efficient at getting little things done quickly, but it’s become 
impossible for me to do anything effectively that takes longer than a few 
minutes. Just ask Gary and Martin how difficult it’s been to write this 
book with me! 
 Martin’s Comments on the Quiz 
Unlike Kevin, I only answered “Yes” to 24 of the 27 questions – I’m 
way ahead! But, I thought it might be helpful to share a few additional 
details:
■
Question 8. Do you wish you could use it in the shower? I 
answered No because my showers only last about 3 minutes (my 
hair is really short). If my showers were longer, I might be breaking 
out the Ziploc bag for BlackBerry shower use. (Kevin told me he 
sometimes takes baths so he can use his BlackBerry.) 
■
Question 15. Ever bump into anyone? I answered No because I 
believe I am an adept multitasker. I only take glances at the 
BlackBerry when I’m sure no one is anywhere near me. Also, here 
in Ormond Beach, Florida, I rarely walk where there are lots of 
other people. Most of the time, the only things I would bump into 
are my dogs, Belle, Pixie and Wolfie—and they know how to keep 
their distance. 
■
Question 23. Do you have backup BlackBerry smartphones? Being 
in the BlackBerry video and training business, I actually have three
to five working BlackBerry smartphones at any one time. 

57 
■
Question 25. Do you play games on your BlackBerry? I’m too busy 
doing other things on my BlackBerry to play games. 
■
Question 27. Do you feel helpless with your BlackBerry? No. I feel 
I’m in total control of this device. At least, that’s what I keep 
telling myself! 
 Musings of a BlackBerry Abuser 
I take pride in the level of my intelligence. I like to think that I know a 
little more than the average person. Once, during a game of Cranium, 
I got the answer wrong on a particular question, but I felt my answer 
was correct. I pulled out my ’Berry and Googled it. As it turned out, 
after about 20 minutes of research, I was, in fact, incorrect. Now 
anytime a matter is in question, my friends always challenge me to 
Google it with my ’Berry. For the record, I’m usually right! 
During Church, my friend and I make commentary on the sermon 
using the BlackBerry Messenger program, even though we may be 
sitting right next to each other. 
I return e-mails while on the toilet. 
When I’m downstairs and my wife is upstairs, I talk to her with the 
BlackBerry Messenger program, so I won’t have to get out of my 
recliner.
I have one friend who does not have a ’Berry. I offered to buy him one, 
just so it would make my life easier if he had one. 
Once, while being intimate with my wife, my ’Berry was on the night 
stand, and I received an e-mail. I wasn’t going to check it, but my wife 
could tell that it was killing me to know who emailed me. She made 
me check it so I could get back to focusing on the matter at hand.

 Dual Addiction
Not long ago, my wife joined forces with me and finally got a
BlackBerry. Well, Friday night she was in the hospital doubled over in
severe pain. They kept running test after test. While I was waiting, I
got online to several sites and got a great idea. 
Why not surf with two BlackBerry smartphones at once?
My wife handed hers over to me, and it was great. While one was
loading pages, I could play the BrickBreaker game with the other. I
could also surf and type emails. I now think two BlackBerry
smartphones is the way to go. 
By the way, I cleared it with the nurse before I was surfing away. And
my wife is fine, but she wanted her BlackBerry back. 
—Johnny D, CrackBerry.com Member 
One measure of our addiction are the hoops we jump through just to get these
devices in the first place! 
Can you relate to these stories? Are you thinking that this book really was
written with you in mind? Did you score more than 10 on the quiz? Chances
are that the person who bought you this book thinks you should have scored
even higher! 
The first step is for you to admit your problem, especially since you can now
see it in black and white. You need to keep reading, take copious notes, and
resolve to make some important changes in your BlackBerry use. Good luck to
you!

“OK, I Am a 
BlackBerry 
Abuser” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 6 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: becoming more responsible in how you use your 
BlackBerry. 
There is a time and a place to use your BlackBerry – and it isn’t all the time 
and everyplace – no matter what your BlackBerry Addiction Quiz says! 
Step6:
PlantoBeaMore
ResponsibleBlackBerryUser
Step 6: Plan to be a more responsible BlackBerry user. We commit to begin 
addressing our shortcomings and BlackBerry-related character defects. 
In other words, Step 6 is where you freely admit you are a BlackBerry abuser and 
start to fix some of your errant ways. 

60 
Still reading the book, huh? Our guess is that means you didn’t do so well on 
the quiz in the last chapter. Don’t worry. As many in the field of addiction say: 
“The first step to recovery is admitting the problem.” So, you have a problem. 
You can’t put your BlackBerry down. You use your BlackBerry too much. You 
bring your BlackBerry into the bathroom, the bedroom, the dining room, and 
everywhere else. 
We can help you, but first you have to resolve to make some significant 
changes in your behavior. If you are willing to see that you are, in fact, a 
CrackBerry Addict, then you’re ready to move forward. We’ll wait for you… 
OK, we agree. You’re a CrackBerry Addict, so let’s move on. 
A study by Rutgers University Professor Gayle Porter blames BlackBerry for 
fueling a spike in email and Internet addiction. The key symptom: You can 
only go a few minutes without checking for new email. 
The good professor goes on to say that these addictive effects can be 
devastating, and that employers should really realize that “addiction to 
technology” can be equally as “damaging to a worker’s mental health” as 
chemical or substance addictions. One key sign of a user being addicted is if 
she focuses on her BlackBerry while ignoring those around her. 
KeyAddictionSign:

inordertofocusonyour
BlackBerry.

61 
The Work-Life Balance 
You need to begin thinking honestly about your BlackBerry use in both your 
personal and professional life. Imagine there were a balance scale that showed 
the balance of your work and personal lives. If so, would such a scale show a 
reasonable balance between these lives, or would your BlackBerry use weight 
the scale significantly toward the work side)? 
BlackBerry:AHelporHindrancetoyourBalance?
?
The key to recovery from any addiction is self-realization. You need to admit 
to yourself that you do indeed have a problem. Only after you admit to the 
addiction problem can you realistically begin charting a path to a more 
balanced life. 
Seeing the Light at the End of the Tunnel 
Unlike most of the things tied to the word addiction (e.g., drugs, gambling, 
and alcohol), the BlackBerry is, by design, a useful tool that can increase your 
productivity, save you time, and even allow you to balance your work and 
personal lives better. 


62 
There are countless examples of people saving an hour a day because they are 
now converting what was once downtime into productive time. 
For example, Gary shares: “I have increased my personal productivity and 
balance by using my BlackBerry. How? I put personal and work appointments 
in my BlackBerry. I set limits on when I use it. I realize when I’m doing 
something negative, and I try to stop these negative actions from becoming a 
habit. 
Sure, I’m slightly addicted, but I realize it, and I work to control it. With any 
addiction, it takes constant vigilance to keep it in check. Unlike most 
addictions, you can use the BlackBerry to improve your life and the lives of 
those around you—in both work and personal arenas!” 
Let’s take a step back from the personal side of BlackBerry addiction and look 
at some anecdotal numbers for the problem. 
 Lakefront Cookout 
Our lake club has an end of the season cookout that is for adults only. 
We set up tables on the beach and out onto the main dock, light up 
the tiki torches, and serve up the BBQ and drinks; the emphasis here 
is on drinks.
I’m at the end table on the outermost portion of the main dock, and 
I’m sitting at the very end of this table. The night progresses 
wonderfully, with good friends sharing a meal and some fun 
conversation.
After participating in the discussions, jokes, and general banter, I 
became a bit quiet. My wife noticed, but she was having too good a 
time to really pay attention. She and her girlfriends were laughing up 
a storm and putting the red wine away at a blistering pace, so my 
sudden change in demeanor was a very minor concern to her. 
What she didn’t know was that I was using the BlackBerry Messenger 
program and carrying on two simultaneous conversations. I had my 
BlackBerry down in my lap, just under the edge of the table, and I was 
texting away like mad. There must have been a lull in the conversation 
at the table just as I received a joke from my BlackBerry buddy in L.A. 
(I’m in Northern New Jersey). 

63 
I let out a loud snort and started to laugh pretty hard, and it drew the 
attention of everyone around me at the table. Suddenly my wife 
realized what I was doing and shot me a frigid look. I was on vacation 
from work, at the last party of the year at the lake, and I darn well 
ought to be paying attention to my friends. Rather than yell at me 
from five seats away, she whipped out her own cell phone and sent 
me a one word text message: “Stop!”

Addiction by the Numbers 
Before the statistics professors roll their eyes and the professional pollsters 
toss their arms in the air, let me be honest and say that the numbers quoted 
here are not in any way scientifically rigorous. But, by the same measure, they 
do give us some sense of the numbers concerning BlackBerry addiction. 
Recently, www.CrackBerry.com proudly announced that it had topped two and a 
half million members. Imagine that! More than two and a half million people

A larger survey was conducted by Sheraton Hotels1. In its survey of 6,500 
traveling executives, 35 percent of the respondents said they would choose their 
smartphone over their spouse. Of those polled, 87 percent said they bring their 
devices into the bedroom. 
In the same survey, 84 percent of respondents said they check their emails just 
before they go to sleep. And another 80 percent said they check them in the 
morning, as soon as they get up. 
Of those polled, 62 percent said they love their BlackBerry or PDA, and most of 
them said the device makes their life more productive.

■ Tip  As we strongly suggest throughout this book, you may want to direct more of your love 
to your spouse or family than your BlackBerry! 
The survey also found that more than three quarters of those polled say their 
gadgets give them more quality time with friends and family... and help them 
enjoy life more [Author’s note: Is this denial or what?]. 
■ Note  Here’s something to keep in mind about the skewed sample populations. The 
www.CrackBerry.com survey is of people who have been motivated enough join a forum and 
ask technical questions about the BlackBerry. So it’s quite likely that the sample of BlackBerry 
users is skewed toward those who are heavy users and may exhibit more addictive behavior 
than the general BlackBerry user population. 
So, we need help. We use our BlackBerry smartphones too much. We’ve got a 
monkey on our back, and it comes from a Canadian company called RIM. We 
(or someone close to us) bought this book, for crying out loud! So we have a 
problem. But don’t worry or panic; you can overcome this addiction, and we 
will help you.

“Ask Others for 
  Help” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 7 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: asking others for help in behaving more responsibly 
with your BlackBerry. 
Step7:
AskforHelpinAchieving
ResponsibleBlackBerryUse
Step 7: Ask for help in achieving responsible BlackBerry use. We realize that 
we need help from those around us to become more responsible BlackBerry 
users. This might mean having others put our BlackBerry in safe place until we 
can learn to use it without hurting ourselves or others. 
In the traditional Step 7 of the recovery process, recovering addicts humbly 
ask a higher power” to remove their shortcomings. That is a very important 
piece of the process for moving forward and restoring a healthy balance in our 
lives. We need to be able to “step away from the BlackBerry” for at least some 
period of time if we are to achieve that balance. Remember, the goal is to 
master the BlackBerry, not be a slave to it. 

66 
WhoistheMaster?
YouorYourBlackBerry?
One difficulty in stepping away from the BlackBerry is that these devices are 
extraordinarily multi-functional. We use them for one thing, the email 
indicator blinks or vibrates, and then we are right back to our addiction. 
Two of the authors, Gary and Martin, are avid cyclists. Gary has the bad habit 
of using his BlackBerry as his primary MP3 player (in addition to all the other 
things he uses it for). So, how does this get him in trouble?  
Gary will leave his house (in nice weather) early in the morning and start his 
beautiful, scenic ride towards the ocean. He has about 600 songs loaded on his 
memory card, and he has the playlist set to shuffle his favorite tunes. This is 
the true story of one morning ride that turned sour and reminded Gary that 
using a dedicated MP3 player might be the better way to exercise. 
He leaves the house at 7:00 for a nice 30-mile ride. Five miles in, he stops at 
the beach to take in the sun and the sights. He makes his first mistake: he takes 
out the BlackBerry and starts to multitask. He notices the red light blinking 
and thinks: “It is an email from Martin; this could be important.” Well, it was 
important, so now he feels that he can’t wait until later to respond. 
He takes a minute, now cooling down, to type a response. He hits send (the 
music is still going), and he gets back on the bike. 10 minutes later, the music 
stops and he hears Martin’s ring tone. “What’s the harm,” he thinks as he pulls 
out his BlackBerry and takes the call. He then tells Martin that he is on his bike 
and needs to pull over. They talk for a minute and then Gary gets back on the 
bike, but again he sees the red light blinking. Like the fool he sometimes is, 
Gary checks the email and thinks, “This message is from Kevin; this might be 
important, too.” You get the idea. Gary stops three more times on his 30-mile 
ride to answer phone calls and check email. The stress starts to build as he 
realizes that he now knows he has work waiting for him back at the house. 
“Next time” he resolves, “I will leave the BlackBerry and take the iPod. Or, I 
will turn off my wireless signal while I ride, accepting no emails, text messages 
or phone calls.” 

67 
■ Caution  As we mentioned earlier in the book.  Research has shown that staying connected 
to electronic devices that cause constant interruptions, such as your BlackBerry, while trying to 
exercise can leave you more mentally fatigued than refreshed. 
This is just one of many examples when we should know better and leave the 
BlackBerry behind. If we can’t leave it behind, can we at least learn to ignore 
the temptation of checking in? 
Here is another exercise for you. Ask yourselves the following questions—
again, try to answer them honestly! 
An Exercise: What Should You Do? 
At first glance, these might seem similar to the BlackBerry Addiction quiz; 
however, these are meant to be ongoing scenario questions for you as you use 
your BlackBerry on a daily basis. We have tried to come up with a number of 
situations that could take you off track from being a responsible BlackBerry 
user. These questions will help you be more prepared to answer responsibly. 
 
You are sitting in a meeting and your BlackBerry starts beeping. What should 
you do? 
•
Addicted Choice: Ignore others and check it out. 
•
Better Choice: Remember to turn your BlackBerry profile to 
Silent mode and don’t look at it during the meeting. 
 
 

68 
 
You are riding in a limo with family members on the way to a funeral. What 
should you do? 
•
Addicted Choice: Ignore others and use your ’Berry. 
•
Better Choice: Remember to turn your BlackBerry profile to 
Silent mode and don’t look at it during the ride. 
 
 
 
Now it’s time for you to write a few answers of your own. 
 
 
You are sitting at a traffic light waiting for it to turn green. You have your child 
in the back of the car. What should you do? 
•
Addicted Choice: 
 
•
Better Choice: 
 
 
 
You are driving down the road and your BlackBerry vibrates, telling you that 
new email has arrived. What should you do? 
•
Addicted Choice: 
 
•
Better Choice: 
 
 
 
Your children are sitting around at home with your family in the evening, and 
you have an opportunity to check and use your BlackBerry. What should you 
do? 
•
Addicted Choice: 
 
•
Better Choice: 
 
 
 

69 
 
You’re making dinner together with your spouse and your BlackBerry vibrates. 
What should you do? 
 
 
 
You are walking down a busy city sidewalk, and your BlackBerry vibrates, 
saying email has arrived. What should you do? 
 
 
 
You are sitting in the airport, surrounded by a bunch of strangers. Should you 
use your BlackBerry, or strike up a conversation? 
 
 
 
You are walking into your work office and getting in the elevator. Should you be 
using your BlackBerry at this time? 
 
 
 
You are on a field trip with your child’s class, and one of the other parents is 
talking to you and your BlackBerry buzzes. What should you do? 
 
 
 
You are talking with someone you just met at the local park, and your 
BlackBerry vibrates or beeps, saying you received a new message. What should 
you do? 
 
 
 
You are at a meal with a colleague and your BlackBerry buzzes. What should 
you do? 

70 
 
You’re talking with your colleagues at an informal meeting, and your 
BlackBerry buzzes. What should you do? 
 
 
Do any of these situations sound familiar? If you can relate to these questions, 
then you probably use your BlackBerry too much. If you have any hesitation 
about what the right answer is, you need help. 
Electronics Rehab Getaway 
The BlackBerry phenomenon has not gone unnoticed in our world. Many joke 
about it, and some good capitalists have found ways to help those who can’t 
seem to help themselves. In addition to buying copies of this book for all your 
BlackBerry using friends, think about a BlackBerry-free getaway. 
Several hotels in the Canadian Rockies have now offered Electronic Rehab 
Getaways. When the guests check in, their BlackBerry smartphones and other 
electronic gadgets are locked up in the hotel safe for the duration of their stay. 
With this service, the hotel guests can unplug and enjoy their stay. Also, the 
rehab guests can benefit from meditation, herbal teas, and spas to help ease 
the pain of detachment from their trusty BlackBerry smartphone. 
With recent prices ranging from CDN $499 to $529/night in the Fairmont 
Hotels in Jasper Park Lodge, Lake Louise, and Banff, this is significant 
investment to break your BlackBerry addiction1. You could also try reading 
and following the steps in this book; that might help you achieve a long-lasting 
result for a much lower investment!

CrackBerry Massage and Spa 
Ideal for the high-strung professional, Washington's Lunar Massage 
Studio offers the Crackberry, a 20-min. hand, thumb and arm massage 
that targets the modern malady known as "digital thumb" — an 
overexerted appendage sore from constant BlackBerry and iPhone 
jabbing. Targeted kneading releases tension in key areas. 
Owner Joanna Robinson says the treatment, created on a whim, is a 
perfect fit for the nation's capital: "I understand the D.C. nerdy culture 
and the young professional," she says, referring to the massive corps 
of 20- and 30-something associates and interns who storm 
Washington each year. The $26 hand massage is for "the people who 
work very hard but make very little."2 
On a related note, various spas around the country are offering spa or massage 
treatments to help with the dreaded “BlackBerry Thumb”  (sore thumb joints 
due to over-using your BlackBerry).

We all need to step away from time to time. Too much of anything can be a 
bad thing, even too much BlackBerry. Like most things in our lives, when we 
step away—even for just a little while—we become much more appreciative of 
what we have when we step back into our regular world. 
So, take a break. Go for a walk, or go out and appreciate nature or your family. 
And leave your BlackBerry at home. You will be OK. You can always get back to 
people later; they will wait for you.

“BlackBerry 
  Bystanders” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 8 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: listing the innocent vicitims of your bad BlackBerry 
behavior. 
Step8:
ListThoseBlackBerry
BystandersWeHaveWronged
Step 8: List those BlackBerry bystanders we have wronged. We will make a list 
of all those people (named and unnamed) that we have hurt because of our 
BlackBerry addiction. 
In other words, Step 8 requires that we begin our attempt to redress those we 
have harmed. To do that, we need to identify who those people are. 

74 
Let’s review where we are so far in the recovery process. We are BlackBerry 
abusers and overusers. We have used our BlackBerry smartphones at 
inappropriate times and in inappropriate places. We have acknowledged that 
that we need time away from our beloved messaging device, but we also need 
help. So, we have asked others to take it away for a short time, or we have 
asked for interventions to help us curtail our corrupt behavior. 
 My 5-Year-Old Son 
I try not to check my BlackBerry too much 
outside of work because my five-year old son 
said I pay more attention to it than him. 
—Anonymous
And so we come to the Step 8 on the road to BlackBerry recovery. In the 
traditional 12-step program, this is where we make a list of the people we have 
harmed and resolve to make amends for our bad behavior. It is easy to just 
shrug this one off and say, “Nobody gets hurt by my BlackBerry use.” We can 
also rationalize our use of the device and say, “I’m working when I use it; I’m 
making a living for me and my family.” The truth is, we can rationalize all we 
want. But if we spend too much time with our fingers on the keys, then we are 
taking time away from things, and the people around us that are far more 
important.

 BlackBerry at Funeral 
My mother passed away in January of this year, and in the limo ride to 
the grave site, my brother was so addicted to his BlackBerry that he 
used it the whole ride. His wife had to finally take it from him at the 
gravesite to ensure that he didn’t look at it or get tempted to reply 
during the service. 
My brother loved our mom, but just can’t put the darn thing down for 
15 minutes. He never established boundaries for its use, and he tends 
to have a personality anyway that always does things to an extreme or 
at a real intense level. 
Boundaries and moderation in all things is a core life lesson that has 
been lost in our fast-food, drive-through, open 24/7, everything-has-
to-be-convenient-and-immediately-accessible society. This addiction 
shouldn’t really be a surprise. It is what is marketed to us as cool and 
valuable.

Using your BlackBerry during a funeral, memorial, or other service is an 
extreme example of ignoring the feelings of others. But such an example does 
help us put BlackBerry use and abuse into perspective. 
Let’s take a look back at some of the questions we answered in Chapter 5: “Am 
I a BlackBerry Abuser?” Our answers in that chapter might give us a clue about 
who we might actually be hurting with our bad BlackBerry behavior. One 
question asked in the list of questions was this: “Do you ever sneak away from 
groups to use your BlackBerry without anyone knowing?” Now, imagine that 
you are the person with whom you were having a conversation. There you are, 
engaged in dialogue with a friend or colleague, and all of the sudden they walk 
away—possibly in mid-sentence. Worse, you imagine you see this friend or 
colleague take out his BlackBerry and check for messages or email. What 
message does that send to you, the person left standing there? Can you 
possibly feel anything other than unimportant, ignored and even abandoned? 
How much did this person think about your feelings when he just walked 
away to check his BlackBerry. 
What you feel now is the same feeling you inspire in others when you do 
similar things. 
Here’s another question we asked in Chapter 5 was this: “Do you have to 
check your BlackBerry before bed and immediately upon waking?” 
Martin writes: I do this quite often. Now, I don’t feel so badly about this if my 
wife is still sleeping. I am great at offering rational explanations: “I am part of a 
small company with clients around the world.” It sounds convincing and even 
makes sense, but the truth is, it is just habit to check my email in this fashion. I 
want to see what I missed while I was sleeping.  Maybe a new sale came in 
from the web site?  Maybe our amazon.com ranking went up over night for our 
other books? Sometimes, I do want to get a jump on my busy day. However, if 
my wife is awake, I owe it to her to be attentive for the few minutes we have 
before she goes running off to work. I can usually wait an hour before reading 
my email and suffer only a  minimal impact. 

77 
Concerned Bystanders 
Sometimes BlackBerry users and abusers are approached by those around 
them with concerns about their BlackBerry overuse. Let’s look at a few 
examples from Made Simple Learning customers and others. 
 Quotes from Concerned Bystanders 
My husband threatens to take it away all the time. 
—Helen Ann R. 
People tell me they’re concerned all the time! I’m told I should seek a 
BlackBerry therapist. 
—Lenny M. 
My wife constantly tells me she’s concerned. 
—Jonathan D. 
My wife was always complaining that I was on that thing all the time. 
So I bought her a BlackBerry, and it worked. Got her! 
—Oscar M. 
My family and friends have approached me about my BlackBerry use, 
and I have been asked many times to leave it at home or in the car 
while attending an event, so that I can give my full attention. 
—Moe
My wife will ask me if I could ever watch a TV show without my 
BlackBerry in my hand. I tell her, “I don’t think so.” 
—Ed H. 
My girlfriend and I used to get into constant arguments about my 
BlackBerry. She often got frustrated when we would be watching a 
movie or talking. This all changed the day we got her a BlackBerry, 
too. Now we both share in the addiction! 
—Super moderator paulbblc from the BlackBerryForums 
I have had my BlackBerry for about two weeks, and my girlfriend 
hates the thing. I’m always on it, and so on. So I told her she could use 
it for a day. Well, when it came time for me to get my phone back, she 
wouldn’t return it. We had to go get her a BlackBerry, as well!

Most of us would scoff at the notion that our BlackBerry and, consequently, 
our email, is more important than our families and the ones we love. Yet, at 
times, our behavior says otherwise. When we reach for the BlackBerry instead 
of our spouse or partner, we inadvertently send the message that our work or 
even our ’Berry is what is most important to us, instead of those people right 
in front of us. Whenever possible, remember to take the BlackBerry out of your 
hands and put your arms around the ones you love. 
You might also remember this question from the quiz in Chapter 5: “Have you 
ever checked your BlackBerry while at a meal with others?” 
My guess is that many of us have engaged in this behavior from time to time. 
We may have dealt with why we engage in this behavior, but now we need to 
look at the consequences of our actions. In this scenario, we don’t walk away. 
Nor do we sneak into the restroom to check our email. Rather, we take out our 
BlackBerry (or hide it under the table) and just ignore the people who are with 
us. 
Again, we can rationalize this by saying: “Hey, the guy across the table has 
been doing this all night.” So what? We should know better. Even if the 
conversation is boring, you are interacting with live human beings. You are 
engaging in social relationships, and those should be the priority of the 
moment. 
Whether it is our own feeling of self-importance, our arrogance, our 
insecurities, or just plain rudeness, we should know better than to do this. 
These acts send a clear message to our friends and associates that they are just 
not as important as the new newsletter from www.CrackBerry.com or the email 
from our accountant.

 Missed a Big Hit at Baseball 
I remember a couple of years ago, when I went to  my son’s baseball 
games. While it was true that I took time away from work to go to the 
field, sometimes three or four days a week, I was really there to see 
him. Too often, I took out my BlackBerry and did work, checked email, 
or simply surfed the Web when I got bored. 
On one occasion, I was checking an insignificant email when my son 
got to the plate. This time he had a beautiful hit. When he got to first 
base, he looked over at me and saw me in the BlackBerry prayer
position. I looked up and caught his eye as he stood on the base—but 
he and I both realized that I had missed his hit. I felt horrible. I felt like 
a jerk and a bad father. 
—Gary Mazo 
My guess is that we all have had moments like these, moments we that were 
lost and we can never have back because we were so engrossed in our 
BlackBerry smartphones. Shame on us! 
Sometimes the BlackBerry ultimatum can arise: choose me or choose your 
BlackBerry. To the non-BlackBerry user, this ultimatum would likely swing 
towards the human side. To a BlackBerry addict, the choice might not favor 
the human side (see the story, “Berry vs. Boyfriend: Who Wins?”).

 Berry vs. Boyfriend: Who Wins? 
So, I was dating this guy for about three months, and it was just 
getting serious. He was perfect: smart, efficient, practical, savvy, and 
best of all, always available. His name was ’Berry, which is short for 
BlackBerry. It was a perfect relationship. But, there came a point 
where ’Berry lacked the ability to give me the emotional attention that 
I needed. As much as I enjoyed sleeping next to ’Berry, with him on 
my night stand and me in bed, one can only wish for an in-bed 
companion. Which brings us to Derek. 
Derek was the type of guy who would always open doors for you. He 
was the type to always make sure he let you know he was thinking of 
you every day. He was, all-in-all, a very nice guy and a very good 
catch. On the downside, he wasn’t very tech savvy. The man had a 
Motorola Razor and thought it was groundbreaking. He was the guy 
that always forgot to charge his cell phone at night or left it at home 
and was able to go a whole work day without his phone by his side. 
Clearly, he didn’t have the same relationship with his mobile device 
that ’Berry and I had. 
I like to give people a good look into my life when they are about to 
enter it. So, during our first date, I put out a much-needed warning: I 
am reliable on my BlackBerry, but I have really bad phone etiquette. 
Of course, at the time this did not faze him. But I don’t think he knew 
the severity of the BlackBerry disease that I had. It was his own fault 
for not realizing it was a serious thing. Why else would I feel the need 
to bring it up on a first date? 
We were well into our fourth week of dating when I landed a new job 
at a high profile tech company here in Seattle. At this point, both 
Derek and I knew how we felt about each other—well as much as you 
know after four weeks together, anyway. We were having a nice 
dinner, when... 
      *buzz buzz buzz*
      *typing typing typing* 
      “Sorry. Work,” I said mid-email. 
      “Yeah, but do you have to answer it at dinner?” 
      “Yeah, it is kind of my job.” 
      *buzz buzz buzz* 

81 
      *typing typing typing* 
      “Really, you can’t answer that later?” he asked as it became 
increasingly clear his dinner was slowly but surely being ruined. 
      *buzz buzz buzz* 
      *buzz buzz buzz* 
      *buzz buzz buzz* 
This man then reaches over and takes ’Berry into custody. 
Now, I want you to take into consideration that we are at a very nice 
restaurant. This is a place that he has wanted to take me for a while. 
So, yes, I felt bad for doing this, but A) this is my job and B) this is 
’Berry we are talking about! 
Some BlackBerry demon came over me, and I don’t know what 
happened. I stood up, threw my napkin at him, grabbed my phone, 
and stormed out. All the while, I was saying some highly inappropriate 
things, such as “You are lucky there are witnesses around, or else 
your hands would not be capable of grabbing anything else for a very 
long time.” 
Needless to say, that was the very last time I saw him, talked to him, 
or even uttered his name until now. 
True BlackBerry addiction overcomes the rules of attraction. This 
story does have a happy ending. 
’Berry and I lived happily ever after. 
—Tristan
 
Sometimes, bystanders of BlackBerry addiction are created not by gross 
overuse of the device, but the lack of BlackBerry use altogether. No story can 
illustrate this better than that of one user who caused a full airplane of 
passengers to suffer because of his BlackBerry needs (see the story, “Frequent 
Flyer’s Fiasco/Stand-by Hell”). 

82 
 Frequent Flyer’s Fiasco/Stand-by Hell 
It was Easter weekend, and I made the mistake of agreeing to travel 
from Seattle down to Southern California to visit my parents on a 
cheap stand-by flight. I figured if I got to the airport early enough (5 
AM), I would be able to score the first flight out. Boy was I wrong. So 
wrong!
I was getting passed over on flight after flight. Not only was it Easter 
weekend, but it was also Spring break. It never really occurred to me 
that California is a Spring break getaway because I was born and 
raised in Southern California. At this point, I was able to catch a flight 
down to San Francisco in hopes that it would be easy to catch two 
shorter flights than one longer flight. Once again, I was wrong! 
I spent about seven hours trying to get onto a flight in Seattle, and 
now I was going on my sixth hour doing the same in San Francisco. At 
this point, it is safe to say that I was delirious. I had basically 
overdosed on Starbucks and fast food. Every hour, I ran to a different 
gate, just to get turned down.  
It had now come down to the point where if I didn’t make this last 
flight, I would be staying the night in the San Francisco Airport. This 
would be the last flight to Southern California, and there were no 
more flights back to Seattle. 
I remember the stomach-turning feeling I had while I was waiting to 
hear my name called to board the plane. And then, finally, I heard my 
name. I jumped up, grabbed my carry on, and boarded the plane. 
The door was now closed on the airplane. The flight attendant had 
just finished making sure everyone was seated and securely fastened 
in. I reached for my BlackBerry to turn it to flight mode—and realized 
it was nowhere to be found. I’d left it at my seat in the airport!
My first reaction was to hit the call button. As soon as I realized that 
was not going to work, I unbuckled my seat belt, flung my body to a 
standing position, and started yelling, “I’m up! I am standing up!” That 
sure got me a lot of attention. The flight attendant came over, and I 
explained to her that I left my BlackBerry on my seat at the gate. She 

83 
continued to tell me that there was no way I could run out and get it 
because the doors had already been closed. I told her to let me off 
immediately. She finally agreed to meet me half way. She checked 
whether someone in the airport could run out to my former seat, grab 
my BlackBerry, and then pass it to the captain through the cockpit 
window. To me, this sounded like the perfect plan! 
By now, the passengers were wondering why weren’t moving. I was 
starting to calm down because I felt my BlackBerry would be safe. I 
was just starting to relax when I heard: 
*BING*
“Sorry for the inconvenience; a young gentleman has left his 
BlackBerry in the gate, and he has requested for us to obtain it for 
him. It is getting passed through the cockpit; we apologize for the 20 
minute delay.” 
The flight attendant was putting me on blast! I couldn’t believe it! 
Now, let me explain to you the horror and sweet joy getting my 
BlackBerry was. Every row this flight attendant passed caused people 
to turn their heads, so people could catch a glimpse of this young
gentleman who delayed the plane. By the time I had my BlackBerry in 
my hand, I also had every pair of eyes shooting rays of hatred from 
their pupils. I had found the most effective way to make new travel 
friends!
—Tristan L. 
 
What’s really amazing about this story is that flight attendants and pilots 
realized the vital importance of the BlackBerry to this passenger. I’d venture to 
argue that if Tristan had left some other phone or smartphone, or maybe even 
an iPhone in the airport, the plane would have taken off without delay. A 
BlackBerry on the other hand? Better hold the flight! Better to inconvenience 
and delay a plane load of passengers rather than have a BlackBerry addict 
forced to go cold turkey on his flight! 
The story shows us that we are all BlackBerry bystanders in this world; there is 
no escaping the phenomenon. Sometimes, even the BlackBerry addict will 
become a BlackBerry bystander (see the story, “Kevin’s Missing Curve”). 

84 
 Kevin’s Missing Curve 
I experienced the frustration of losing my BlackBerry firsthand in 
2007, when the BlackBerry Curve was first released. I had seen a 
sneak peek of RIM’s newest phone at the company’s annual partner 
show (Wireless Enterprise Symposium) in Orlando, Florida. The Curve 
was amazing and sure to be a big hit. However, when it came time to 
release the phone to the world, the 02 wireless network in the UK was 
first to get it. 
AT&T was scheduled to launch a few weeks later. My BlackBerry 
addiction was a bit out of hand, so I couldn’t wait to get my hands on 
RIM’s newest release, and I forced a friend in Europe to buy the 
phone for me the day it was released and then ship it out to me in 
Canada.
The online tracking said that the phone left for Canada, but the local 
UPS office never received it. My Curve didn’t arrive. Obviously, it’s 
wrong to point fingers because even UPS’ investigation turned up 
nothing. However, I’m pretty sure there is one more BlackBerry addict 
in the world today, thanks to my device that never arrived.

Exercise: List Your Own BlackBerry 
Bystanders
At this point, you’re ready to list all those people whom you may have 
offended or hurt or could have hurt (but luckily did not) while using your 
BlackBerry in an abusive or rude manner. 
(Don’t be shy; feel free to add more lines if you need them!)

“Scooping 
  BlackBerry 
  Poop” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 9 of overcoming BlackBerry 
addiction: making amends to those we’ve wronged. 
Step9:
MakeAmendstoOur
BlackBerryBystanders
Step 9: Make amends to our BlackBerry bystanders. We will make amends to 
those whom we have wronged by our BlackBerry abuses; we will “Scoop our 
BlackBerry Poop.” 
In other words, it’s time to do the hard work of not just recognizing our wrongs, 
but also addressing them and righting them. 

88 
 
At the end of the previous chapter, we identified those whom we have hurt. 
We also acknowledged more bad behavior and resolved to make amends. 
Well, talk is great, but it is also cheap. On our road to BlackBerry recovery, we 
must now clean up the mess we’ve made. Step 9 of the official 12-step 
program requires that we to make amends, except when doing so would cause 
injury or unnecessary pain. This chapter deals with cleaning up our 
BlackBerry mess. 
In the previous chapter, we shared some personal stories of the BlackBerry 
messes we have created from time to time. For example, Gary shared the story 
of his BlackBerry use at everything from his son’s baseball game to a dinner 
out with friends. He can’t get those moments back. However, it is possible that 
Gary was able to rationalize his behavior (given that he works in the 
BlackBerry business), but we all know the truth. 
The simplest, but most difficult thing to do seems to be to apologize directly 
for our bad behavior. This is only one way—one small way—of cleaning up the 
mess. We begin with the ones we love, the innocent bystanders we spoke of in 
previous chapters. Gary can certainly say “I’m sorry” to his son for missing his 
hit. 

89 
I’mSorry…
The look in Gary’s son’s eyes was one of disappointment on that day, and no 
father likes to disappoint his kids. So, Gary can let him know that in the future 
he will to try to keep his BlackBerry in the car and not even bring it to the game 
or whatever other activity his kids might be participating in. Gary will focus his 
attention on his kids. If Gary needs to make a call (which sometimes does 
happen), he can go back to the car and not pretend to watch. In today’s world, 
sometimes it is important to be reachable. However, it isn’t always essential to 
take every call and read every email immediately. 
IsitreallyessentialthatI
havemyBlackBerry
now?
 

90 
Remember the situation from the last chapter, where you were checking email 
under the table when you thought no one was watching? Or perhaps you are 
someone who checks the BlackBerry as the last thing you do at night and the 
first thing in the morning. If so, you might tell your significant other, “I’m 
sorry that I do this.” Maybe you can resolve to keep your BlackBerry 
somewhere else. If you need the phone near you in case of emergency, resolve 
to only answer important phone calls. 
Fortunately, the technology of the BlackBerry itself can actually help you clean 
up your mess. Not only can you resolve to not check your email before bed, 
but you can set the preferences of your BlackBerry to only check for email 
during certain hours. If you feel that you might be expecting an important text 
message from one of your kids, you can give the SMS messages a different look 
and feel. For example, you might give it a custom ring tone or adjust the LED 
notification. If you’re expecting a call from the boss, you could give her a 
unique caller tone, so you can easily identify that call you may need to answer. 
If you take your BlackBerry to bed with you each night, don’t think you’re 
alone. It’s a common occurrence. RIM now has a feature in the BlackBerry 
operating system software called Bedside mode. When you place your 
BlackBerry in the charging pod accessory, it automatically enters bedside 
mode and displays a clock on the screen. You can fine-tune the Bedside mode 
settings, such as disabling alerts from coming through while you’re sleeping 
(or even shutting off the device radio altogether). If you are unsure of how to 
do any of these tasks, just visit www.crackberrybook.com or check the forums at 
www.crackberry.com for easy solutions that can help you.  
On a truly serious note, one area where you really do hurt people with your 
BlackBerry use is when you text or read and reply to email while driving. 
Please don’t ever do it; make that resolution now. If it is so essential to get a 
message to someone, there are some great third-party software programs than 
can convert voice to text and then deliver emails and text messages. 
DriveSafe.ly, Vlingo, Jott and Nuance, and Voice on the Go come to mind as a 
few examples that might work. Or better yet, pull over to the side of the road if 
you really need to focus on an activity other than driving! 

91 
We tell you all about these tips in our books and on our web sites. Injuring or, 
worse, killing someone because you were texting or emailing while driving is 
one mess that you won’t be able to clean up, and it is completely avoidable. 
Some of the members and users of www.CrackBerry.com have shared the 
following stories with us. 
 Jam on My BlackBerry while at a Red Light
I’m guilty of checking email, messaging, and placing calls while 
driving. It’s pretty hard to type while driving, so I keep the sentences 
shorter. But if I’m at a stoplight, I do the “Flight of the Bumblebee” 
with my thumbs to shoot out tons of text to the person I’m responding 
to. Personally, I think I can type pretty quickly on the BlackBerry; that 
teenage girl who won the SMS Text Messaging speed competition 
better watch out! 
— tbetts1982, CrackBerry.com Member 
 
 Use BlackBerry AutoText to Reply in Car 
If my son is in the car with me, I will have him check the message for 
me. If I am alone, sometimes I will send a quick reply at a stoplight. 
Just yesterday I made a new AutoText: ppp, which translates to this: 
“Driving, will reply soon.” I drive a six-speed, and I am not skilled 
enough to text and shift at the same time.

92 
 BlackBerry on Wheel, Typing Next to A 
Police Officer 
I’m in bumper to bumper traffic most of the time driving home, so I 
get about 25-50 emails sent out on the way home. I also read RSS 
feeds, SMS Text, and so on. I’ve done this for years, and my 
BlackBerry is always at the top of the steering wheel. While I’m typing 
with one hand, I can see the road, as well as what I’m typing as I drive. 
I’ve done it while cops were driving next to me and behind me, and 
I’ve never had an issue.

Often, when we think of CrackBerry addiction, we think of the BlackBerry user 
herself as being the burdened individual. But, as with any addiction, most 
CrackBerry addicts fail to realize their actions may be out of the norm. Tom’s 
story of lunch with an addicted co-worker portrays a common BlackBerry 
Addict occurrence (see the story, “He Stopped in mid-Story to Use His 
BlackBerry”). 

93 
 He Stopped in mid-Story to Use His 
BlackBerry
First of all, I’m not a BlackBerry owner, nor have I have ever used one. 
However, I work in an office environment where there are a few 
people who love their CrackBerry. Usually it doesn’t bother me at all. 
But other times I feel jealous because they can check and respond to 
their email while on the go, while I can’t). 
Usually, I’m quite tolerant of others. But today I observed some 
disturbing behavior by my fellow co-worker while we were having 
lunch. For lunch, four of us decided to go out for sushi, and my co-
worker proudly placed his CrackBerry on the table. Ok, no big deal. 
During lunch, he would periodically check his ’Berry for new 
messages (or whatever he was looking at), and this didn’t bother me 
either.
But finally, he did something that really did disturb me. He was talking 
to the rest of the attentive group around the table and was in the 
middle of a story saying, “I know this military guy...” Then he glances 
at his ’Berry and says “Oh oh.” Next, he starts furiously reading his 
screen without ever excusing himself, leaving everyone else around 
the table dumbfounded. I think this person needs rehab! 
—Tom, CrackBerry.com Member 
 
One thing that is clear is that there is plenty of BlackBerry Poop to be scooped. 
Many a BlackBerry user (and most BlackBerry abusers) have hurt people or 
annoyed others with their insensitivity when using their BlackBerries. Have 
you ever been given the “evil eye” at the movies or in a restaurant? Have you 
ever had your spouse or significant other, or perhaps your kids just lose it with 
you because you were so intent on answering the email or checking 
something on line on your BlackBerry? 
You are making great progress through this book. But now it’s time to go back 
and try to fix some of the damage you’ve caused. It’s time to make amends, to 
do the right thing and clean up your mess. 
Please use the checklist That follows to help you complete this important step 
in your BlackBerry recovery.

Apologizing to Your BlackBerry

“BlackBerry 
  Etiquette” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 10 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: adhering to basic rules intended to keep your 
BlackBerry use (and abuse) in check. 
Step10:
TirelesslyAdhereto
BlackBerryEtiquetteRules
Step 10: Tirelessly adhere to BlackBerry etiquette rules. We resolve to live by 
the BlackBerry Etiquette Rules. When we break them, we will work hard to fix 
our ways. 
In other words, we resolve to turn off the BlackBerry during all meetings, classes, 
presentations, weddings, and funerals. We will also refrain from using our 
BlackBerry during dinner, while at the movies with our significant other, or in 
the bedroom. 

96 
We may even need to detox from the BlackBerry for a short period, until we 
can learn to use them without hurting ourselves or others. 
Our journey has taken us to the Step 10 chapter. Traditionally, this is the step 
where we establish a personal practice that helps us take a constant personal 
inventory and take corrective measures before we veer off our path. For 
BlackBerry users and abusers, this means that we must resolve to live by 
several interventions, rules, and tips, which we’ll cover momentarily. 
BlackBerry Abuse Interventions and 
Etiquette Rules 
The authors are grateful to Made Simple Learning customer, KC, who 
provided many of the interventions and rules that follow. We’ve modified 
these only slightly, to format them for inclusion in this book. It’s possible that 
we can all adapt these practices to help us step away from the BlackBerry and 
maintain a sense of balance in our lives: 
Intervention #1: Check the BlackBerry at the door when you arrive home and 
do not look at it until after dinner. 
Intervention #2: Leave the BlackBerry in the car when you are attending a 
family event or kid’s activity. Focus on the family; all email, BBM, and other 
messaging can wait at least one hour. 
Intervention #3: No electronic devices at or near the dinner table during any 
meals. Thus, kids can’t bring Game Boys, and mom or dad can’t bring their 
BlackBerry smartphones. 
Intervention #4: Do not use the BlackBerry while driving any vehicle; if you 
must use the BlackBerry, then pull over and stop. Note that a Bluetooth 
Headset for calls is permissible. 
Intervention #5: Do not use your BlackBerry to send or reply to messages after 
10:00 PM. When emailing at night, exhaustion can cause come through as a 
disrespectful tone. We are also more inclined to miscommunicate. We all need 
time to turn off our brains and rest. 
Intervention # 6: If you follow the aforementioned five interventions, others 
will learn that you are not available 24 / 7, and their expectations for replies 
will be more appropriate and supportive of you having a real life. 
A Made Simple Learning customer points out the benefits of following these 
interventions in the story, “Achieve Balance with Interventions.” 

97 
 Achieve Balance with Interventions 
Co-workers, friends, and family know when I can be reached, as well 
as my boundaries for a response. I set aside time with my family, and 
my family and I get to enjoy life a little bit. 
It took me a while to discipline myself this way. But I started with an 
email and voicemail boundaries message to all that stated the points 
of the preceding paragraph. My boss, co-workers, business 
colleagues, spouse, kids, and friends all responded positively. Today, 
reply expectations are balanced with a personal life and family time. 
—KC
 
Addiction Avoidance Tips 
Addiction avoidance tips are not as strict as the interventions; however, such 
tips can help nudge you into more responsible BlackBerry use: 
Tip: Place your BlackBerry far enough away from your bed that you can’t reach 
it without getting up. 
Tip: Use Bedside mode or manually turn your BlackBerry to Off at night, or 
use the Auto Off feature (Options ➤ Auto On/Off). 
Tip: Whenever possible, take the BlackBerry out of your hands and put your 
arms around someone you love. (Whenever possible and appropriate, make 
that someone the person who bought you this book!) 
Tip: At a meal with others,  excuse yourself and walk away from the table if you 
find you must use your BlackBerry. You may find yourself using your 
BlackBerry less. 
Tip: Turn off vibrate and ringer for new email, so you aren’t tempted to grab 
for your BlackBerry at every message. Do this by selecting Sound Profiles > 
Edit Profiles > Select a Profile > Edit various types of alerts (Email, Calendar, 
BBM, etc.) You can also disable the red blinking LED light too while you’re at 
it. 
Tip: Plug in your BlackBerry for nightly charging in a room other than your 
bedroom. That way, you won’t be tempted to turn it on in the middle of the 
night! 
Tip: Ask someone else in the vehicle with you to check your messages and 
read them to you. The passenger can also type a reply, if required. 

98 
Tip: Use voice-activated software if you absolutely need to use your 
BlackBerry in your vehicle. Examples of such software include Vlingo, 
drivesafe.ly, Jott and Voice On the Go. 
Tip: Try to avoid sending a quick message reply anytime day or night. You are 
setting expectations that you will always do this! 
Tip: Stop and look around you. Will your colleagues, friends, or family be 
afraid to approach you because you seem “too busy with your BlackBerry?” 
Tip: When on vacation, use an out-of-office reply to colleagues whom you will 
not respond to by email until you return. Also, provide an emergency contact 
person (not you), if necessary. 
Tip: Try to setting your BlackBerry down for 15 minutes. Next, try setting it 
down for 20 minutes, and then 30 minutes or more. Try to wean yourself off 
the device slowly. 
Tip: Set your personal appointments (e.g., spouse, kids, and friends) on your 
BlackBerry with equal priority to your work appointments. And keep them! 
Tip: When you’re on a bike ride, set your Sound Profile on your BlackBerry to 
do nothing for email, SMS, and calendar alarms. Leave the phone on if you 
need people to keep in touch with you. 
If someone gets used to us replying within 10 minutes at any time, day or night, 
he will come to expect such prompt responses. If someone gets used to us staying 
up late checking email, they will send you email at all hours of the day and 
expect a quick reply. 
Here is another set of rules, courtesy of a kind user at www.CrackBerry.com (see 
the sidebar, “Top Ten Rules to Live By.” 

99 
 Top Ten BlackBerry Rules to Live By 
10. Never use your BlackBerry at a family function. 
9. Never use your BlackBerry on a date with your spouse or loved one. 
8. Never use your BlackBerry while operating a motor vehicle. 
7. Never use your BlackBerry in the restroom. 
6. Never use your BlackBerry in a movie theater. 
5. Never use your BlackBerry at one of your children’s concerts. 
4. Never use your BlackBerry in a hospital. 
3. Never use your BlackBerry at church. 
2. Never use your BlackBerry in a meeting at work. 
And the #1 rule for BlackBerry use: Rules 10 through 2 are null and 
void if you think you can get away with it! 
—Chad, CrackBerry.com Member 
 
We need to go above and beyond these rules. We also need to make some 
lifestyle change,s so we can continually practice good BlackBerry etiquette 
and restore some balance to our frenetic lives. 

100 
Top 10 BlackBerry Productivity Myths Busted
One way to establish the extended rules of behavior it to bust some of the 
popular BlackBerry Myths that exist, myths that drive us to rationalize the 
behavior and actions that got us to buy this book in the first place (we, the 
authors, would like to add that we are most grateful that you did). The top 10 
most popular BlackBerry myths are as follows: 
1.
I’m more successful because I’m available 24 / 7 with my BlackBerry! 
2.
Always using my BlackBerry during “downtime” makes me more 
productive. 
3.
If I respond with short messages (email or text) immediately, I’m more 
productive. 
4.
It’s OK to use my BlackBerry at a stoplight. 
5.
That slight pain in my hand is nothing! 
6.
Multitasking on my BlackBerry makes me much more productive. 
7.
It’s OK to use my BlackBerry in front of my children and spouse; they’re 
doing something else anyways. 
8.
It’s OK to use my BlackBerry in the bathroom.  
9.
It’s OK to use my BlackBerry at the dinner table (or restaurant). 
10. I’m more productive because I respond to email during boring 
presentations or business meetings. 
Now, if you have been reading this book closely and thinking seriously about 
what we say, then you will recognize that each myth is just that: a myth, or 
rationalization for bad behavior. The only way to dispel these myths and see 
the truth is to make a conscious effor to change your attitude, perception, and 
behavior. 

101 
Rationalizing Our BlackBerry Use 
As we have been discussing in this book, we are great at rationalizing our 
BlackBerry addiction. For example, we say things like the following: 
•
If I am working all the time, then that must mean I am a 
good provider, husband, mother, and so on. 
•
If I am working all the time with my BlackBerry, then I am 
not doing the devil’s work. Idle hands make idle minds. 
•
I must keep working with my BlackBerry to prove my worth 
to the world. I am only what I accomplish in this life. I have 
no worth outside what I accomplish. 
In the words of Sigmund Freud: “This is a load of crap—a huge pile of 
BlackBerry poop that needs to be scooped.” Ok, maybe Freud didn’t say that. 
But if he had been alive during the days of BlackBerry overuse, he might have. 
There is so much more to life than work. 
Do you know why work is called work? Because all the other four letter words 
were taken! There is a wonderful Cherokee Expression on the “Meaning of 
Life.” 
 When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live 
your life so when you die, the world cries and you rejoice. 
—a Cherokee Expression 
 
A personal favorite statement on the purpose of life comes from the incredibly 
simple philosophy of the Dalai Lama: 
 What is the purpose of life? I believe that the purpose of life is 
to be happy. 
—the Dalai Lama 

102 
Now, we need to ask ourselves whether using our BlackBerry in ways that 
bring pain to others is really what brings us happiness? If you answered “Yes, 
this is what brings me happiness,” then please re-read this book, beginning 
with Chapter 1. We will be waiting right here for you when you finally “get it” 
and return to this point in the book. 
Early on in this book, we talked about needing to be masters of our BlackBerry, 
not the other way around. At this stage on our path towards recovery, it’s 
espeically important that we be in control of the ’Berry and not be controlled 
by it. 
The Table Analogy 
Basic etiquette tells us that there is a simple way to set a table properly. We put 
forks on the left, and we put knives and spoons on the right. Sometimes, we 
get fancy and put little forks to the left of bigger forks; we might also do the 
same with spoons. But these issues are not as important. 
What is important is that there are certain acceptable, societal norms for 
setting the table, and the manners we bring to the table reflect on our basic 
etiquette and decency. For example, we should avoid slurping our soup 
(except in Asia), keeping our elbows off the table, chewing with our mouth 
open, and so on. 
The same holds true for using our BlackBerry at the table. Typically, a 
BlackBerry should go to the left of the smallest fork (if space permits) or in the 
space below the silverware. A BlackBerry should be turned so that the red light 
faces you and no one else. A BlackBerry should also be put into Silent mode 
when at the table. When the red light goes off, try not to look at it. Instead, just 
let it blink and wait until someone at the table says, “Hey, I think you have an 
email.” That acknowledgment will give you permission to cradle your 
BlackBerry in your hand and check your email.

“Conscious 
  Contact or 
  Constant 
  Contact?” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 11 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: setting priorities for our BlackBerry use. 
Step11:
ResolvetoReconnectWith
OthersAroundUs

104 
Whenyouareonyour
BlackBerryanddoing
somethingelse,haveyou
noticedthatbothsuffer?
Step 11: Resolve to reconnect with others around us. We resolve to reconnect 
and have conscious contact with those directly around us, rather than constant 
contact with those on the other end of our BlackBerry. 
In other words, it’s time to rely less on our beloved ’Berry for companionship, 
and more on the family and friends who figure most significantly in our lives. 
Congratulations! You are making progress. You have identified bad behavior, 
you have resolved to make changes, you have reached out to those you have 
hurt, and you have begun to set a path upon which you can walk with your 
head up (not hunched over checking email.) You are almost ready to embark 
on a new way to live life, where you can be present for your loved ones and still 
enjoy the benefits of your BlackBerry—in moderation. 
In the traditional 12-step program, Step 11 of the recovery process speaks 
about making conscious contact and using prayer and meditation to help 
ground us and connect us to our own definition of our higher power. When we 
do this, we realize that there are things much more important than us and way 
more important than our BlackBerry. These things can offer us guidance and 
give our lives meaning. As we have pointed out in previous chapters, we are 
very quick to rationalize bad behavior. However, we do realize that sometimes 
BlackBerry overuse does reflect poorly on us, even in the professional world 
with which we so desperately try to stay connected. 
When you are on your BlackBerry and doing something else, have you noticed 
that both suffer? Studies have shown that multitasking can cut down on the 
pleasure that a person takes from the process of doing activities when more 
than one activity is done at a time. Studies have also shown that multitasking 
may decrease efficiency because the brain is not able to give adequate 
attention to any one of the many tasks that are competing for its time. 
The authors want to give special thanks to business and life coach Martha 
Young, JD/MBA, for the content that follows. Martha works with lawyers and 
business professionals. She contributed to this book, and she can help you to 
kick your BlackBerry addiction as a part of reaching greater goal,s such as 
business growth and closer relationships. To learn more about her work, go to

Multitaskingmayeven
decreaseefficiencybecause
thebrainisnotabletogive
adequateattentiontoanyone
ofthemanytasksthatare
competingforitstime.
The simple techniques that follow can help you connect you to your higher 
power, ground you, and, ultimately make you more effective and productive: 
Meditation: Take five minutes a day in the morning to center your mind. If you 
are using a BlackBerry because you think it gives you an edge in keeping 
connected to your customers, then consider focusing on how you will provide 
the best service for your customers and meet their needs. Go over the faces of 
your customers as you meditate in silence and think about how you might 
serve them best. With quiet time and clear thinking, you may be able to 
connect with ideas that will benefit you and your customers. The BlackBerry is 
not the only way to achieve your goal. In this case, what may be most 
important is the quality or type of your communication, not its quantity or 
speed. 

106 
Affirmations: Consider whether your customers may be able to prosper and 
while you succeed whether you check your BlackBerry 5 times a day or 50. You 
might want to try this out. Try going for a week where you check your 
BlackBerry only 5 times per day. Say to yourself whenever you have the urge to 
check your BlackBerry, “My customers and I are prospering whether I check 
my BlackBerry or not.” 
Distract yourself. Put music on, take a bike ride, hike to the top of a mountain, 
work out, get away from thinking about work. Turn your BlackBerry off and 
engage in some activity that takes all of your concentration and that you enjoy. 

107 
Prayer: We all joke about the BlackBerry Prayer Position: head bowed, hands 
together in front of your face, and the solemn expression. Of course, what you 
are really doing is using your thumbs to type the email (even in a place of 
worship.) So, here is something else to try: Assume the same position, sans 
BlackBerry. Whatever your understanding of your higher power may be, try to 
connect with that power through dialogue with your thoughts, instead of 
through your thumbs. 

108 
Helping You Reflect on Your BlackBerry 
Addiction
This chapter is all about coming clean and connecting with the things that 
really matter. Take a few minutes and reflect carefully on the following 
questions: 
•
Think about a time when you lied about using your 
BlackBerry. What was happening? To whom did you lie? Why 
did you lie? What were you afraid would happen if you didn’t 
lie?

Sit with this knowledge for a moment. Many times it makes 
sense to lie because you fear some sort of punishment if you 
were to tell the truth. Children who get caught lying might 
get grounded or lose their allowance. What is the 
punishment you fear you might face if you told the truth 
about your BlackBerry use?  
•
Do you think your spouse or partner will criticize you? If this 
is true, we suggest that you come to some agreement with 
your partner, family, and friends about when it’s OK or not 
OK to use your BlackBerry. Once you reach such agreement, 
it’s important that you honor it and turn off your BlackBerry 
during those times when you’ve agreed not to use it. 
This is similar to the hospital approach. You’ve probably seen the hospital 
signs that say, “No cell phone use.” Similarly, airplanes do not allow cell 
phone use during flights. The issue is that the cell phone can actually interfere 
with the equipment in the hospital or on the airplane, and thus potentially 
endanger the lives or health of those around you. 
Consider that your BlackBerry use could endanger the emotional health of 
your relationships. There is a cost to a relationship or family when one of the 
members is not fully present because she is checking email or answering cell 
phone calls. Over time, the BlackBerry user may not be asked to engage in 
some activities. Other family members may count on the BlackBerry user to 
give only part of their attention to the activity, so they may give up on them in 
little ways. For example, a child might see you at the kitchen table drinking 
coffee in the morning and using the BlackBerry, and thus refrain from 
approaching you to talk about something that is bothering him at school. The 
worst part: You may never know what conversations aren’t happening 
because others have tuned you out, too. 

109 
 
Or, the potential future love of your life might see you on a park bench, but 
assume you are busy to talk and never approach you. Again, the costs here are 
often hidden; you may never know what you are missing out on, but your life 
will be less complete for it, nonetheless. 
When she was young, Martin’s youngest daughter learned how to let him 
know when she had had enough of him making calls, a technique she 
continues to use to this day. She will start screaming out, “No phone, no 
phone!” Martin is actually glad she does this. He says: “I will be afraid about 
the day when she stops doing this and just gives up on me as a playmate.” You 
may have friends, family, and others who have given up on you because they 
never get all of your attention when you are glancing down at your BlackBerry. 
Now, the news isn’t all bad. There are great ways that you can use your 
BlackBerry to help you connect with what is truly important. If you are person 
of faith, there are free and pay versions of the Bible and other sacred literature 
that you can read on your BlackBerry. Or, you might find a meaningful 
Thought for the Day website and subscribe to a daily inspirational message. 
Your BlackBerry can also be used as a tool for connecting in new ways to your 
loved ones (see the story, “Staying in Touch with My Dad”). 
 
 Staying Better In Touch with My Dad 
Well, my Dad recently got a BlackBerry, and I’m jealous. We got the 
BlackBerry Messenger set up for him, and now were PINing (i.e., 
sending BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry PIN text messages) each other. The 
ability to send quick messages back and forth is extremely cool. The 
nice thing is that we can stay in touch a little more easily because 
now we have the ability to send quick messages and emails to one 
another at any time. This helps us stay in touch better because there 
are times when phone calls are not appropriate, but emails or text 
messages are.

The preceding story gives us a great concluding thought for this chapter. What 
better way to establish conscious contact with those we love than by buying 
them a BlackBerry? In fact, both Martin and Gary’s fathers are now the proud 
owners of new BlackBerry smartphones and copies of our books. Kevin also 
hooked his mom up with a BlackBerry recently. This is her first cell phone 
ever, and the phone’s BlackBerry Messenger program has brought them even 
closer together. 
The truth is that there are more important things than our BlackBerry 
smartphones, and we all can find more time to spend with friends and family. 
It’s also true that we can all do with a little less time opening what seem to be a 
life-altering emails and spend more time meditating, praying, or conducting 
meaningful dialogue with those we love.

“Typing the 
  Talk and 
  Walking the 
  Walk” 
In this chapter, we will walk you through Step 12 of overcoming your 
BlackBerry addiction: acting responsibly and spreading the word. 

112 
Step12:
ResolvetobeResponsible
andSpreadtheWord
Step 12: Resolve to be responsible and spread the word. We resolve to stick to 
the rules and help other BlackBerry abusers learn and practice these rules of 
responsible BlackBerry Use. We promise to “Type the Talk” and “Walk the 
Walk.” We encourage everyone we know to buy this book and learn the path to 
responsible BlackBerry use. 
In other words, we have examined the roots of our BlackBerry addiction 
problems and resolved to do better. Now it’s time to make that transition from 
imagining how to do better by implementing the techniques outlined in this 
book. 
At this point, we need to walk the walk and talk the talk, as it were. We also 
need to help others who are still struggling with their BlackBerry use and 
abuse. 
So here we are. We are ready to approach living with our BlackBerry in a new 
light. We have established a plan for healthy BlackBerry behavior, our old ways 
have been abandoned, and we’ere readey to chart a new path of BlackBerry 
use, one where we don’t abuse the device. The traditional Step 12 in a 12-step 
program calls upon us to carry this message forth. It also calls on us to carry 
these principles into all aspects of our lives. 
There is a progression to achieving good BlackBerry behavior. Please refer 
back to our “BlackBerry Etiquette Rules” list.  
If BlackBerry use during meetings is a problem, try to either outlaw BlackBerry 
use during meetings, to define monetary fines for unauthorized BlackBerry use, 
or to set breaks every 30 minutes for people to check their BlackBerry 
smartphones.

BlackBerry Addiction Avoidance Tips 
It doesn’t matter whether we are the BlackBerry abuser or we employ, work 
for, live with, or are related to the BlackBerry abuser. We are all affected by 
BlackBerry misuse, and we all can help to initiate change. To that end, what 
follows are some guidelines that can help both the BlackBerry abuser and 
those around her to overcome her CrackBerry addiction. 
Advice for Employers 
Don’t force your employees to be “on call” 24 hours a day just because they 
have a BlackBerry. 
Advice for Parents 
You need to set limits for your kids with respect to their BlackBerry use. Here 
are two key things you can do to encourage responsible BlackBerry use by 
your kids: 
•
Teach them to not respond to unsolicited email or text 
messages. 
•
Set basic rules, such as no texting at the table, no email while 
doing homework, and so on. 
Advice for All BlackBerry Users 
Finally, here is some general advice that all BlackBerry users would be wise to 
adopt: 
•
Don’t take yourself too seriously: Yes, you have the coolest 
device around, but so what? Your device doesn’t define you; 
you define it. So make your BlackBerry proud by behaving 
appropriately. 
•
Be kind, courteous and respectful: Don’t talk loudly in public 
places, don’t leave the table to answer an email, and don’t 
even bring your BlackBerry to the table! Above all else, don’t 
ever text or email while driving. Be sure to use a third-party 
voice-to-text program, if necessary. 
•
Remember that your BlackBerry is a tool: You are the device’s 
master. It does what you want, not the other way around. If 
you let the BlackBerry control you, you’re the one who ends 
up looking and acting like a tool! 

114 
Properly used, the BlackBerry is an amazing tool. You can use it to organize 
your life, schedule every moment of your time, keep all your contact 
information and personal data in one place, invite people to meetings, listen 
to music, watch videos, and so on. This is all in addition to using the device for 
its core functions such as checking and composing emails, text messages, and 
more. 
Each of the authors of this book freely admits that he is guilty of BlackBerry 
overuse. Each of them also supports his families in whole or in part through 
BlackBerry-related career choices. Not one of them one disputes the 
superiority of the platform (OK, other people might make a case for some 
other phone from Cupertino, CA—but we know better) or the abilities of the 
BlackBerry to make people more productive. However, each of us has come to 
understand that, as with everything else, too much of a good thing can cease 
to be a good thing. 
We encourage you to use your BlackBerry smartphones proudly and to 
celebrate the culture of which you are a part. We also encourage you to follow 
the steps in this book to text responsibly, talk respectfully, email courteously, 
and remember that there are places and times when using your BlackBerry is 
just inappropriate. 
TheResponsibleBlackBerryUserCredo:
IpromisenottousemyBlackBerryinanysituationthat
couldharmmyselforothers– eitherinbodyormind.
We firmly believe that responsible BlackBerry use will enhance and restore 
balance to your life. We also believe that responsible BlackBerry use will foster 
harmony with those you love. If you feel yourself starting to slip and fall off the 
BlackBerry Wagon, then please review the earlier chapters in the book and 
work through the process again. You can also do the following: 
Visit www.crackberry.com and join the CrackBerry rehab group in the community 
forums. Here you can gain strength from other recovered BlackBerry users and 
abusers.

Our Final 
Thoughts 
We hope you have enjoyed learning about ways that you can be more 
responsible in how you use your BlackBerry. We also hope it helps you achieve 
a better, more productive, and ultimately more satisfying personal and 
professional life. In this chapter, we’ll touch on some final thoughts we’d like 
to share, including suggestions for getting the most out of both this book and 
your BlackBerry in general. 
Gary’s Final Thoughts
When I took the quiz in Chapter 5, I answered Yes to 17 of the questions. My 
wife, Gloria, thinks I really should have scored a 19! I have taken the tough step 
to admit that I have a problem, that I am a BlackBerry abuser. That said, I have 
resolved to make some changes. 
One of the first changes that I’ve made relates to something I spoke of earlier 
in this book: I no longer use my BlackBerry as my music player on bike rides. 
Too often, a phone call would come in, and I would stop my ride and start 
working when I should have been relaxing. It was also rude to my riding 
partners. So, now I only bring the BlackBerry for “emergency purposes.” I now 
put it in the pack under the seat and set the profile so it won’t ring. 
Another change that I’ve made is to leave my BlackBerry in the car when I go 
out to eat with my family or to the movies with my wife. It was too tempting to 
check email during the previews or when the teams changed sides. Invariably, 
this led to continued emails and then phone calls and ignoring my loved ones. 
I’ve been trying to make my off time sacred, I’ve trying out the notion that 
folks can wait a little while for receiving a response from me. 

116

Kevin’s Final Thoughts 
When I initially took the quiz in Chapter 5, I answered Yes to 26 out of 27 
questions. When you run a site like www.CrackBerry.com, I guess being a 
BlackBerry abuser is part of the job description. The question about whether I 
wished I could take the  BlackBerry into the shower with me actually solicited 
the answer of Other. It was shortly after I got my BlackBerry that I started 
soaking in a bath tub instead; there’s no need to stop using my device that 
way! 
When I finally had the realization that BlackBerry addiction was a serious 
problem (the night I discovered my girlfriend was more into her BlackBerry 
than me), I finally decided to do something about my addiction. For me, it 
really came down to out-of-sight, out-of-mind. Still feeling naked without a 
BlackBerry nearby, I tricked myself by using the device’s Auto-Off feature. I’d 
set the device to automatically turn off shortly past my bedtime and turn on 
again shortly before I woke up. This ensured a good night’s sleep and curbed 
the temptation to wake up in the middle of the night and check out why the 
red light was blinking.  
But after a while, the thought of having the phone turned off completely 
started to scare me. What if there were an emergency, and someone needed to 
call me? So, I created a custom profile for bedtime that left the ringer on, but 
silenced all other notifications. RIM employees must have been thinking the 
same thing because all new BlackBerry smartphones have a Bedside mode 
function built into the Clock application. 
When going out to restaurants, I began leaving the device in the car. Similarly, 
I try to leave the BlackBerry in my locker when I visit the gym. When sitting at 
home and watching a movie, I began to leave my BlackBerry in the other room 
with the profile set to Phone Only. Baby steps! Regardless, with effort I have 
weaned myself from absolute dependence on the device, and now I score a 
controlled 6 on the BlackBerry Addiction quiz. 
But once an addict, always an addict. The bad thing about addictions is that 
people are subject to relapse, and that’s been an issue for me in this case. 
While I now have my BlackBerry use under control, it does take discipline and 
conscious effort to maintain control over the device. Every day is a struggle, 
and I’ve found responsible use to be a slippery slope. Given the chance, my 
addiction may slide out of control again. That said, I take it a day at a time, and 
I am much better off than I was thanks to the information, stories, and 
knowledge gained in working on this book. 

117 
Martin’s Final Thoughts 
After more than nine years of continuous BlackBerry use, I feel that I’m really 
starting to get my abuses under control—or maybe I just hide them better. I’ve 
been scolded enough by my family and friends that I now know how to put the 
BlackBerry in its proper place. To be honest, I have my share of relapses, 
especially when something exciting is going on at work or someone buys 
something from our web site.  
I have done my best to never look at my BlackBerry when I’m reading books 
with our youngest daughter or tucking her into bed. I appreciate that it sends a 
bad signal! Now, I try to use my BlackBerry mostly when I’m alone or when 
I’m walking our dogs, Belle (a Black Lab), Wolfie (a long-haired Dachshund), 
and Pixie (a Labradoodle).  
I don’t think the dogs mind too much, but maybe they do. I’ll have to look into 
their eyes next time I’m typing away on the BlackBerry around them. 
 
In gathering stories and helping to write this book with Gary and Kevin, I’ve 
definitely learned to be more sensitive to those around me, especially with 
respect to the safety issues of using a mobile device while driving. I now 
realize that it requires constant vigilance to be a responsible BlackBerry user 
and live by the recommended rules, tips, and interventions.

Constant Effort 
Congratulations! You’ve made it through this book. It might not have been 
easy to recognize just how impolite you were with regards to your BlackBerry 
use; however, you can rest assured that you are not alone. We are all in this 
together. In any case, we hope you have learned something substantial in 
reading this book. We also hope you have resolved how to make some genuine 
changes in your life with regards to your BlackBerry use. 
You may have also realized that making real and lasting changes is difficult to 
do all alone. Lasting change requires both a constant, ongoing effort and help 
from your friends, family, colleagues, and your higher power, whatever form 
that might take. 
If you have learned something and want to make some changes immediately, 
keep reading. If you just want to fuel your addiction and learn even more cool 
stuff 
to 
do 
with 
your 
BlackBerry, 
then 
head 
on 
over 
to 
www.madesimplelearning.com and check out our BlackBerry books and videos. 
While you are at it, head over to www.CrackBerry.com and become register on 
that site as well. Members can learn new things, download cool files and 
programs, and immediately become a part of the biggest BlackBerry user 
community on the Internet. 
Ok, enough shameless plugs. We sincerely hope that you learned a great deal 
from reading this book, and that you can now formulate a plan to better 
manage your life and your BlackBerry without causing unnecessary pain to 
those you work with and those you love. We, the authors, learned a great deal 

119 
when writing this book, as well! Each of us has recognized the signs of 
addiction, and each of us has resolved to follow the steps outlined in this book 
in a bid to live a BlackBerry-balanced life.  
So remember, these rules are just a start. We can do more. For example, we 
can also make some life changes that will improve our quality of BlackBerry 
life—for both ourselves and all those around us.  
To guide us along the path of BlackBerry overuse recovery, let’s review our 
BlackBerry Twelve Step program before we part ways: 
Step 1: Admit We Are Powerless Without Our BlackBerry 
Step 2: Believe in Things More Important than Our BlackBerry 
Step 3: Begin to Turn Away from our BlackBerry Abuse 
Step 4: Take a Moral Inventory of Our BlackBerry Abuses 
Step 5: Admit to Our Specific BlackBerry Abuses 
Step 6: Plan to Be a More Responsible BlackBerry User 
Step 7: Ask for Help in Achieving Responsible BlackBerry Use 
Step 8: List Those BlackBerry Bystanders We Have Wronged 
Step 9: Make Amends to Our BlackBerry Bystanders 
Step 10: Adhere Tirelessly to the Rules of BlackBerry Etiquette 
Step 11: Reflect to Reconnect With Others Around Us 
Step 12: Resolve to be Responsible and Spread the Word 
Living by these 12 Steps is certainly a start. Doing so will make our lives fuller 
and more varied, and it will help us achieve a greater sense of balance in our 
lives. There is more we can do, however.
