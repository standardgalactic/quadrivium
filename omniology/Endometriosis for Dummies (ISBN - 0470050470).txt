Dedication
To all the women with endometriosis we’ve known and treated and to all the
women who’ve suffered without knowing why.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
I thank my wife, Susan and my children, Joshua, Alexis, and Nicholas, for
their love, support, and patience — and Sharon Perkins for her ideas, writing,
persistence, and nagging to get it done.
—Joseph Krotec
Many people helped me write this book, and most of them don’t even know
it. On days when I was discouraged, tired, and grouchy, a phone call from a
family member, a smile from a patient, kind words from a co-worker, or an
encouraging word from someone at church gave me the energy to get back to
writing. For all the people who have crossed my path and lifted me up when I
needed it badly, I thank you — even if you don’t know who you are, I do.
My family just assumes I can do this without a lot of effort, and even though
it isn’t true, I appreciated their confidence. I was fortunate to grow up with
parents who supported everything I did, and I’m blessed to have a mom who
still does. Thanks, Mom! (And Dad, I’m sure you’re watching and applauding
still.) To all the rest of my family, thanks for being there when I need you. And
to Matthew and Emma, my wonderful grandchildren — you’ll never know
what a joy to my life you are.
Thanks, Josh, for being willing to take on this task at a tough time; we’ve been
through some interesting times together. You’re a good doc.
—Sharon Perkins
Both of us want to say thanks to our acquisitions editor, Stacy Kennedy; our
indomitable project editor, Chad Sievers; copy editor Pam Ruble; technical
editor Dr. William Hurd; and our medical illustrator Kathryn Born. Another
great Wiley team!

Introduction
E
ndometriosis is a chronic disease that, until recently, didn’t get the atten-
tion it deserves. In fact, not too long ago, medical personnel and laymen
often dismissed the symptoms of endometriosis as being more psychological
than physical in origin. Fortunately, times are changing, and interest in
endometriosis research has never been higher.
But the more researchers uncover about endometriosis, the more compli-
cated this disease seems to be. For example, some researchers believe that
endometriosis isn’t one, but several different diseases. And many researchers
believe that endometriosis is closely related to autoimmune disease.
If you’re one of the millions of women suffering from endometriosis or if you
suspect your symptoms are from endometriosis, you may not care much
about research; you just want your symptoms to go away! We want you to
feel better too, but we also look forward to the day when researchers dis-
cover what causes endometriosis — so they can figure out how to cure it.
Endometriosis is far more than just cramps. Millions of dollars are lost in the
workplace each year because of absences and surgeries related to
endometriosis. Endometriosis symptoms can cause everything from
headaches to chest pain — in addition to the more common symptoms of
cramps, painful sex, and abnormal bleeding. Many women with endometrio-
sis have suffered for years without realizing they had a serious disease (and
may have been called malingerers, fakers who use illness to avoid work)
because their disease wasn’t visible! Too often these women have given up
on getting help.
We hope you read Endometriosis For Dummies saying, “That’s me! I never
knew endometriosis caused that!” In addition, we hope to help you find ways
to live a more pain-free life. If you want kids, we want to show you that preg-
nancy and endometriosis aren’t mutually exclusive. To sum up, we want to
show you that endometriosis doesn’t have to rule — or ruin — your life.

About This Book
We wrote this book realizing that many women never know that their pain
and suffering (often dismissed as all in the head by family, friends, and doc-
tors alike) stem from a real disease with symptoms so diverse that it some-
times defies diagnosis. Our goal is to inform you about endometriosis and to
help you understand what it is and how it affects many body systems, not
just your reproductive organs. We also want to show you how to live with
endometriosis as painlessly as possible and how to modify the effect
endometriosis has on your life.
We cover all the bases in this book, starting with the basic information on
what endometriosis is, what the symptoms are, and who gets it. If you don’t
know much about endometriosis or about the reproductive system in gen-
eral, start at the beginning of the book and read straight through. After the
basics, we delve a little deeper into how endometriosis affects specific areas
of your life and discuss the treatments for endometriosis. We also help you
decide whether medication, surgery, or alternative medicine options are best
for you.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we use the following conventions to help make the inform-
ation consistent and easier to understand. The last thing we want to do is
confuse you!
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 Bold text indicates key words in bulleted lists and highlights the action
parts of numbered steps.
 Italics identify new terms that are beside easy-to-understand definitions.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we hope you, our dear reader, cherish every word in this book, we
know better. Sometimes you’re just looking for quick answers, but other
times you want to discover everything possible about endometriosis, even
the technical stuff. We’ve designated some information as interesting-but-not-
essential-to-read. Feel free to read it, but if you skip it, you’re not missing 
anything vital. Optional sections are

about endometriosis. We also assume that you want to
 Understand the basic biology of what endometriosis is and why it 
develops
 Understand how endometriosis affects different body systems
 Discover what medical options are available for treating endometriosis
 Be up-to-date on the latest surgical treatments for endometriosis
 Find out how you can get pregnant if you have endometriosis
 Figure out how to manage the pain of endometriosis
Endometriosis doesn’t have to mean the end of a good life for you; you can
figure out how to manage pain, minimize symptoms, and keep endometriosis
from taking over your life. Our greatest hope is that this book takes the clout
out of endometriosis and gives you the tools to live your life as symptom-free
as possible.
How This Book Is Organized
Endometriosis For Dummies is divided into six parts. As with every For
Dummies book, this one is designed to help you find the information you
need quickly and easily, without having to read the book cover-to-cover. The
following explanations can help you find the information you need with a
minimum of effort.

Introduction

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t
What exactly is endometriosis and what causes it? Who gets endometriosis
and why? In these chapters, we explore the mysteries behind endometriosis,
its typical symptoms, the biology behind it, and the most common risk fac-
tors for developing it.
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis
In these chapters, we look at how endometriosis affects various body sys-
tems, such as the menstrual cycle, digestive system, and the urinary tract.
We also delve into the complicated relationship between endometriosis and
infertility and describe the tests that determine whether you really have
endometriosis or another disease. Finally, we help you find a doctor who’s
willing to treat you as an equal partner and make a diagnosis based on your
symptoms.
Part III: Treating Endometriosis
You may already know you have endometriosis. Now the big question is,
“How do you treat it?” These chapters describe numerous treatments, from
traditional to alternative, from medications and surgeries to massages and
acupuncture. We also talk about the way endometriosis affects teens and pre-
teens and how their treatment differs from that of adults.
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis
Life goes on, even when you have a chronic disease such as endometriosis. In
these chapters, we talk about how to cope with work, family, and friends
when you’re in pain. We also give you suggestions for changing your lifestyle
to minimize the impact of endometriosis, including how to eat better, exer-
cise more, and avoid toxins. Finally we provide a chapter specifically for your
friends and family that helps them better understand you and your disease.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We have nothing long-winded in the Part of Tens chapters — they’re short
and sweet, giving you a lot of information in little bites. These chapters dispel
some of the most common myths about endometriosis, give some insight
into the future of endometriosis diagnosis and treatment, and list some quick
ways to decrease pain when you’re down and out with endo.

Endometriosis For Dummies 

Part VI: Appendixes
This section contains two appendixes. The first is a glossary that defines all
the undecipherable (and unpronounceable!) Latin medical terms as well as
other terms in this book that may be unfamiliar to you. The second appendix
is a list of resources to help you find out more about endometriosis, support
groups, and online information sources.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are the strange-looking symbols that appear occasionally in the mar-
gins next to the text. We include them to let you know that a topic or informa-
tion is special in some way. Endometriosis For Dummies includes the following
icons:
This icon identifies information that’s helpful and can save you time or 
trouble.
This icon highlights key points in the section you’re reading.
This icon stresses information that describes potentially serious issues, such
as side effects to medication or other dangerous problems. Pay attention to
warnings — they can keep you out of trouble!
This icon signals information that’s interesting but not essential to under-
standing endometriosis, unless you’re a scientist or medical student.
This icon shows up when a situation requires you to — you guessed it! —
notify your doctor. The situation can include symptoms or side effects.
This icon appears next to information straight from the doctor’s mouth — in
this case, from Dr. Krotec. You can find personal stories and suggestions here
from his years of treating patients with endometriosis.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Enough talk about the book — time to read it already! If this were a novel,
you’d start at Chapter 1 and read straight through. But it’s not a novel, and
it’s not a textbook, where each chapter builds on the one before. You can
open this book at any point and be able to understand the information there.
For example, you may suspect you have endometriosis, but you’re not sure.
Turn to Chapter 2 to read about the most common symptoms of endometrio-
sis. Feeling a little technical today? Turn to Chapter 3 for an in-depth look at
the biology behind endometriosis.
The point is, you don’t have to read everything (although you certainly can,
and you may discover something you never knew before)! Just flip to the
Table of Contents or Index, find a subject that interests you, and turn to that
chapter. It’s not essential to read everything — just what interests you and
helps you.
Endometriosis For Dummies is a resource, a guide that presents the practical
information in a fun, easy-to-read-and-understand format. Read a chapter a
day or a chapter a year, or keep it in the bathroom for frequent browsing. But
however you choose to use this book, we hope it’s helpful.

Endometriosis:
What It Is and Isn’t

In this part . . . 
E
ndometriosis is a long word derived from Greek, as
many medical words are, but what is it? In this part,
we look at the complicated disease of endometriosis: what
it is, what the typical symptoms are, and how common it
is. We cover some biology to give you a good understand-
ing of how all your inner parts interrelate. And we look at
the reasons some women get the disease and others
don’t.

A Quick Run-Through
In This Chapter
 Understanding endometriosis basics
 Educating the public about endometriosis
 Knowing who’s who in endometriosis
 Counting the real costs of endometriosis
 Answering the big question: A self-test
P
eople generally don’t understand endometriosis very well. Until recently,
you didn’t even hear about it — unless you were at a gynecology con-
vention! But new research and better publicity have brought endometriosis
to the public’s attention, making many women wonder whether this is the
nameless disease they’ve had since puberty.
In this chapter, we talk about the little-known disease of endometriosis: what
it is, who it affects, and why it’s received so little attention (despite the fact
that it costs millions of dollars a year in lost wages and productivity). We also
include a self-test to see whether you may have this disease.
Defining Endometriosis
If you tell someone you have endometriosis, you probably get a blank look in
return. Unfortunately most people are pretty clueless when it comes to this
disease. (Check out the nearby sidebar, “The roots of endometriosis,” for
some background on the word itself.)

So what does having endometriosis mean? The following basics can give you
a better grasp of it:
 Every woman has a uterus with an endometrium (the uterine lining).
 When this lining implants outside the uterus, the abnormal condition is
called endometriosis.
 Endometriosis consists of endometrial tissue (pieces of endometrium)
containing glands (just like sweat glands and saliva glands) and stroma
(supporting tissue) growing where it doesn’t belong — anywhere outside
the endometrial cavity.
Sounds fairly clear so far, right? However, endometriosis isn’t quite so simple.
This section looks a bit closer at the complexities of endometriosis, including
how endometriosis moves to different parts of the body and why it hurts.
Figuring out why endometriosis moves
You think you’re starting to understand endometriosis, but you may be won-
dering how pieces of a uterus get into places they don’t belong. After all,
parts of your nose or ears don’t wander to other places in your body, so why
do parts of your uterus travel around to lodge in your lungs, intestines, blad-
der, ovaries, or even your brain?
Unfortunately, the simple answer is this: Doctors and researchers still don’t
know. In Chapter 4, we delve into the mysteries of endometriosis and some
theories of why it travels to strange places.
Understanding why endometriosis hurts
Endometriosis is painful because the endometrial tissue in other locations
behaves just like the endometrium inside your uterus. The endometrium nor-
mally becomes thicker during your menstrual cycle and then sheds off the
10
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
The roots of endometriosis
Endometriosis (en-doe-meet-ree-oh-sis) has six
syllables, but don’t let its size intimidate you.
Just put the accent on the oh and you’ll impress
your gynecologist. (Maybe he’ll even warm 
the speculum for you next time.) The roots of 
the syllables break it down — in Greek, Endo
means inside, and metros means uterus. So
endometrium essentially means inside the
uterus. The -is suffix means an abnormal state,
like gastritis, cystitis, and sinusitis.

wall, flowing out through the cervix and vagina as menstrual bleeding. (See
Chapter 5 for a more detailed description of the menstrual cycle.)
The endometrial tissue in your ovaries or fallopian tubes also bleeds during
your cycle, but the blood has no place to go. The trapped blood irritates
nearby tissue by stretching the lining (like a pimple stretches the skin),
making it tender. In addition, localized inflammatory factors, such as
prostaglandins, interleukin, and tumor necrosis factor (we talk about these in
detail in Chapter 4) also irritate tissue. These inflammatory factors can cause
severe, painful reactions even when very small areas are involved.
But wait, we’re not done. Irritation and inflammation month after month 
can lead to nodules (or cysts) that form on ovaries or other organs. Over
time, these nodules can turn into adhesions (scar tissue) that cause organs
and tissue to stick together, also causing pain. And when the misplaced
endometrial tissue releases chemical irritants over long periods of time, 
a chronic irritation develops, forming extensive scar tissue and — you
guessed it — chronic pain. In other words, every month is a vicious cycle of
pain or other symptoms.
Endometriosis lesions, or implants, range in size from too small to see with
the naked eye to as large as a grapefruit. Most implants are fairly small, the
size of a pencil eraser or smaller. The implants can grow throughout the
pelvis and may be singular (rare) or number in the hundreds (also rare). In
Chapter 3, we cover the most and least common areas for endometriosis to
occur, along with the consequences for each location.
Another factor that makes endometriosis difficult to understand is the
amount of endometrial tissue versus the amount of pain a woman feels. For
example, you may have a neighbor who has just a few spots of endometriosis
but experiences a lot of pain each month, but your sister, who was diagnosed
with many endometrial implants during an appendectomy, may have no pain
at all.

Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Endometriosis: A Quick Run-Through
It’s never too late for endometriosis
A 40-year-old patient came to my office
because her family practitioner had tested her
and diagnosed a cyst in her left ovary. (Her
symptoms had been pain with bowel move-
ments.) Because she was in her 40s, my initial
concern was cancer. This woman had never
had any symptoms related to endometriosis;
she had no painful periods and no pain with sex,
and she had delivered three children without
any problems. What did we find? Stage III (we
define staging in Chapter 9) endometriosis with
a large chocolate cyst (see Chapter 3 for more
on these not-so-yummy cysts!). No doctor
would ever consider endometriosis from her
history. And that’s the problem — endometrio-
sis isn’t always the obvious diagnosis.

Going Public: Why Don’t People 
Know About Endometriosis?
With endometriosis being one of the most common gynecologic problems
that women face, you would expect everyone to know about it. So why don’t
you see ads about endometriosis on television and national telethons to raise
money for research?
This section covers some of the reasons for the relative anonymity of
endometriosis. Sadly, some of these reasons are all too familiar to many
women.
Endometriosis is a women’s disease
Even though women have come a long way, baby, they haven’t come all the
way. Gynecologic diseases, especially non-life-threatening ones, don’t get the
respect, research dollars, or media play that other diseases do. Is this some-
what puritan? Yes. Unfair? Absolutely. Remediable? Of course, but change
takes public awareness.
Simply put, government agencies, insurance companies, and even pharma-
ceutical companies shortchange female problems. Consider the dozens and
dozens of blood pressure medications, diabetes treatments, cold remedies,
and, yes, erectile dysfunction treatments (men must be men!), but modern
science provides few therapeutic options for most female problems. One
reason? The United States is still male-dominated. As a result, according to
documented studies, medical research and treatment for women receive far
fewer dollars than they do for men.
Endometriosis symptoms 
are “all in your head”
Guess what — the naysayers are partly right. Endometriosis really may be in
your head — and in your lungs, appendix, and ovaries, too! But for years,
health professionals have ignored or minimized the symptoms of endometrio-
sis due to a variety of misunderstandings. For example:
 They thought the symptoms were mere exaggerations of the monthly
menstrual cycle.
 They thought the woman was a hypochondriac, depressed, or simply
seeking attention.
12
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 They thought that women were meant to suffer in silence, especially
with traditionally taboo topics, such as menstrual pain.
 Too many women believed (because their moms said so) that all women
suffer during their periods, so they didn’t bother their doctors with their
symptoms.
In fact, many women who seek help for infertility often have a long history 
of painful periods, irregular periods, painful sex, and so on (all signs of
endometriosis). But, too often that history includes a doctor who ignored the
patient’s symptoms or made her feel that the symptoms were normal. (Check
out Chapter 7, which discusses the relationship between endometriosis and
fertility.)
Endometriosis is invisible 
until you have surgery
When a disease has obvious signs (markings on the skin, abnormal EKG, and
so on), the patient usually has confidence in the diagnosis. Unfortunately,
endometriosis has no outward signs and no accurate diagnostic test. As
Chapter 9 discusses, an accurate diagnosis occurs only when a doctor can
visually observe the endometriosis during surgery or through a biopsy.
However, some doctors are hesitant to put patients under the knife for diag-
nostic purposes. Because surgery has risks even under ideal conditions, a
doctor may decide some symptoms don’t justify the risk (see Chapter 11 for
more on surgery and endometriosis). This decision is especially true with
young patients, who often have other problems that can mimic endometrio-
sis. (Chapter 14 has more on teens and their symptoms.)
Endometriosis isn’t glamorous
The symptoms of endometriosis aren’t dire enough or intriguing enough to
draw the media attention — or big funding dollars — that support the more
socially acceptable diseases. Women’s diseases certainly don’t make the
cover of national magazines, and no movie star has broadcast that she has
endometriosis — it’s just not glamorous or popular.
Add to the mix that men don’t usually get endometriosis (yup, you heard me
right) and that it’s not contagious, and you have a formula for widespread
disinterest. So endometriosis remains in the background — a disease that
today’s society just doesn’t bother to promote or treat.
13
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Endometriosis: A Quick Run-Through

Who Gets Endometriosis?
Does endometriosis find its way to all countries in equal numbers, or is it
more of an industrial society’s problem? Obviously, in developing countries,
where women need to worry more about their family’s next meal than mid-
cycle bleeding, endometriosis isn’t a high priority to diagnose or treat. In
addition, endometriosis is less common in women who have many children
and at a young age (which is also more typical in third-world societies).
This section takes a look at the number of people endometriosis affects
worldwide, and it discusses age and pregnancy — two of the important fac-
tors in determining the total number.
Counting the women with endometriosis
How many women have endometriosis? The numbers may surprise you.
Because determining the number of women with endometriosis can be diffi-
cult, estimates worldwide range from as little as 2 to as much as 40 percent.
Based on a relatively conservative estimate then, endometriosis affects one
out of every ten women of childbearing age.
So what women have endometriosis? The following facts provide some
insight:
 More than 5.5 million women in North America alone suffer from
endometriosis.
 Race and socioeconomic status don’t seem to influence the incidence of
endometriosis in any meaningful way.
14
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Speaking of sex . . .
I can’t count the number of patients over the
years that have refused to discuss sex in med-
ical terms. I try to inquire about their sex lives,
orgasms, pain, lubrication, and basic enjoy-
ment, but most women are too embarrassed to
talk even with a gynecologist about these
issues. Most times I hear, “It’s okay,” or “If my
husband/boyfriend wants it. . . .” In addition,
most women have very little understanding of
their sexual and reproductive organs. Because
of this taboo against discussing sex and geni-
tals, too many women have a hard time bringing
up the symptoms of endometriosis, even when a
doctor encourages them to. No wonder this dis-
ease and its symptoms often go undiagnosed.

 Women with lower socioeconomic status (regardless of race) are less
likely to be diagnosed.
 Women with more education and a higher socioeconomic status gener-
ally seek medical care sooner, read more, ask their doctors more ques-
tions, and, therefore, are more likely to be diagnosed with
endometriosis. And, because they’re more likely to delay childbearing
until later in life, these women have more time to develop severe symp-
toms, including infertility.
 Around 50 percent of women with new onset of severe menstrual
cramps have endometriosis.
 At least one-third of infertile women have endometriosis.
Many women don’t know they have endometriosis until they have surgery for
another condition, such as a Cesarean section or tubal ligation. And this inci-
dental diagnosis complicates the numbers issue by raising the following
questions:
 How many other women who never have surgery have undiagnosed
endometriosis?
 If these undiagnosed women have none of the typical endometriosis
complaints, should they be part of the total number of women suffering
from endometriosis?
 If a woman doesn’t have pain, does she still have endometriosis?
 Is endometriosis without pain the same disease that causes so much
pain in other women?
The total number of women with endometriosis is difficult to estimate
because of these great variabilities in symptoms and diagnoses. An accurate
diagnosis of endometriosis is possible only through a visual confirmation
during surgery or by biopsy.
Looking at age and endometriosis
Women between the ages of 23 and 35 are most likely to be diagnosed with
endometriosis. The average age at diagnosis in North America is 27. Table 1-1
shows data by the Endometriosis Association of more than 3,000 women with
endometriosis. The percentage for each group represents the amount of
women who had endometriosis symptoms begin at that age.

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Is endometriosis becoming more common 
throughout the world?
According to a recent World Congress on
endometriosis, the disease hasn’t increased
over the last 30 years. However, doctors are
diagnosing it earlier and more effectively, prob-
ably because more medical personnel are look-
ing for the disease. Also, because of smaller
instruments, better optics, and vast improve-
ments in anesthesia (even local anesthesia),
more gynecologists feel comfortable using
surgery to diagnose the disease (we talk more
about surgery in Chapter 11).
Even in third-world countries, where basic
surgery tools aren’t available and surgery is a
major risk, many doctors are treating women for
endometriosis and could treat more of them if
the resources were available.
Endometriosis is clearly a worldwide disease,
and the estimated number of women suffering
from it is at least 15 million. Nevertheless,
endometriosis is still more likely to be diagnosed
in industrialized countries for reasons that
reflect varying social systems. For example:
 Cultural norms in some countries discour-
age women from complaining about pain,
especially pain related to the reproductive
system.
 Women in industrialized countries put off
childbirth longer and have fewer children.
 Women in poorer countries and third-world
countries tend to have children earlier and
more often.
 Women in poorer countries don’t live as
long — they may even die before puberty.
 Techniques for diagnosing endometriosis
aren’t easily available or may be dangerous.
 The attitude may exist that, if treatment isn’t
available, why bother to diagnose it?
 Medical knowledge of the disease may be
lacking in some areas.
 Women in industrialized countries are more
likely to be exposed to toxins and hormones.
Even with the greater likelihood for it to be diag-
nosed in industrialized countries, endometriosis
is everywhere. Medical journals of Europe,
Japan, and Australia all have numerous articles
on the topic. So the disease is present, but the
real challenges are looking for it and diagnos-
ing it.

The ages of 23 to 35 coincide with the period when many women consider
pregnancy and regularly visit the gynecologist. A woman may have a problem
conceiving, or she may share her symptoms with her doctor, or her physician
may find a problem during the pelvic exam. Any of these scenarios may lead
the doctor to suspect endometriosis (although a myriad of other problems
may also cause these problems). As we note in Chapter 7, there’s no law
against having other diseases and endometriosis!
This age range also coincides with the time women work outside the home
on a regular basis. At this age, the symptoms of endometriosis can alter a
woman’s lifestyle for the worse. For example, women who work full time may
have symptoms that cause them to miss work, or they may have bad days
that detract from their performance. They may now have a boss who doesn’t
understand why they’re bent over in their chair, leave early, come in late, and
miss a couple of days a month due to their recurring symptoms.
The incidence of endometriosis decreases in the 35 to 39 age range, and
problems are rare for women in their 40s, unless they had severe endometrio-
sis at a younger age. In contrast, one study found that 50 percent of younger
women (teenagers especially) who had pelvic pain, bloating, painful periods,
irregular periods, and other symptoms were diagnosed with endometriosis.
This high percentage may be due to the aggressive nature of the disease in
teens. (Check out Chapter 14 for more on treating teens and preteens with
endometriosis.)
Linking pregnancy and endometriosis
Parity refers to the number of pregnancies a woman has had, so women who
have never been pregnant are nulliparous, and women who’ve had at least
one pregnancy are multiparous.

Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Endometriosis: A Quick Run-Through
Endometriosis through the ages
Endometriosis isn’t a new disease, although it
hasn’t always had the same name. Daniel
Shroen first described the symptoms in 1690 as
sores throughout the stomach, bladder, and
intestines as well as broad ligaments that had a
tendency to form adhesions. In 1769, Arthur Duff
described the intense pain of endometriosis,
and it was first seen microscopically in the late
1800s. In 1921, Dr. John Sampson was the first
person to hypothesize that retrograde menstru-
ation contributed to endometriosis. (See
Chapter 4 for more about the retrograde men-
struation theory.)

Endometriosis is
 Most common in women with no children.
 More common in women with fewer children.
 Least common in women with more children.
Linking pregnancy to endometriosis may be a chicken-egg relationship. In
other words, do women who have endometriosis have fewer children
because endometriosis can contribute to infertility, or do they develop
endometriosis because they’ve had fewer pregnancies? Pregnancy does seem
to have a protective and therapeutic effect on the disease (we discuss the
effects of pregnancy in Chapter 4). In fact, pregnancy was one of the oldest
treatments for endometriosis — but, then again, not being able to get preg-
nant may be part of the problem!
Furthermore, endometriosis is less common in women
 Whose first pregnancy occurred at a younger age
 Who have had multiple pregnancies
When women have their first pregnancy early and then have several children,
their uterus and ovaries have longer quiet times — without the steady supply
of irritants from the menstrual cycle, the endometriosis simply burns out.
Calculating the Cost of Endometriosis
Endometriosis literally costs millions of dollars. How ironic is it that a disease
that can’t be seen and doesn’t kill you can still cause so many problems?
Consider this: The main symptom of endometriosis is pain during your men-
strual period, which shows up every month. So endometriosis is a disease
that recurs, almost like clockwork, once every three to four weeks.
This pattern means that every three to four weeks endometriosis is affecting
your life, maybe preventing you from going to work, probably adding to your
medical bills for pain relief, and definitely challenging your relationships.
This section totals some of those high costs of endometriosis.
18
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Can men ever have endometriosis?
Even though a uterus seems like a basic
requirement for endometriosis, a few men 
have developed lesions that appear to be
endometriosis after exposure to high-dose
estrogen treatments for prostate cancer. The
lesions developed in the prostate.

Eying the economic costs
Being in pain once every three to four weeks may not seem bad, but that
week that you’re lying on the couch and taking pain relievers by the handful
means you’re not at work and you’re not contributing to the economy. One
large British study determined the following rather startling statistics on
endometriosis:
 Sixty-five percent of women in the study indicated that they had initially
been misdiagnosed with another condition.
 Seventy-eight percent missed an average of five days per month from
work due to endometriosis.
 Thirty-six percent said that endometriosis had affected their job perfor-
mance, and of this group
• Forty-one percent had lost or given up their jobs entirely.
• Thirty-seven percent had reduced their hours.
• Twenty-three percent had changed jobs.
• Six percent went on disability.
All this sick time and the resulting decreased performance cost the economy
dearly. When you miss work for several days, you aren’t productive. Either
your company pays someone else to take your place or no one does the work.
If you reduce your hours or quit, then your personal economy takes a big 
hit — and the government may end up paying unemployment or disability.
Furthermore, if the pain is severe, you may have major surgery. Women are
typically out of work at least six weeks after such surgery, and this time off
places an even greater burden on the economy. Often a woman who has major
surgery (such as a hysterectomy) doesn’t return to full productivity for sev-
eral weeks or even months. (Some women never get back to full-time work.)
Common complications (wound infection, urinary tract infection, excessive
blood loss, adhesions, bowel complications, and so on) can extend the recov-
ery time even further. When major complications occur (and they do in a
small percentage of cases, no matter how good the surgeon), the result is pro-
longed periods of reduced work, absence, or permanent loss of productivity.
Considering the diagnostic and 
treatment costs
In addition to its effect on the economy, endometriosis (its diagnosis and
treatment) is hard on the wallet too. Considering the vast numbers of women
with the disease, the total cost for even conservative treatments, pain 
19
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Endometriosis: A Quick Run-Through

medication, hormonal therapies, and the like, is enormous. One common pre-
scription for endometriosis is more than $400 per month per woman! This
amount of money is staggering to treat a disease we can’t see and know so
little about.
The total cost of diagnosis, surgical interventions, and extensive treatment is
billions of dollars annually. For example, of the nearly 600,000 hysterectomies
(removal of the uterus and one or both ovaries) in the United States each
year, around 20 percent (100,000) are for reduction of endometriosis–
associated symptoms. The hospitalization, medications, and other fees for
these surgeries cost the healthcare system tens of millions of dollars — 
each year.
Looking at the cost on relationships
The cost of endometriosis extends far beyond money. Endometriosis is hard
on relationships. Chronic illnesses, especially ones that affect sexual rela-
tions, can be a huge strain. The British study mentioned earlier in this 
section reported the following statistics:
 Seventy-two percent of the women studied reported they had problems
with relationships due to endometriosis.
 Ten percent said that endometriosis had caused a split in a relationship.
 Thirty-four percent said it caused significant problems with their 
partner.
 Eleven percent said they had trouble taking care of their children.
How can you even put a price on these problems? No one can estimate a
monetary number to compensate for loss of life’s pleasures and love. These
emotional and social problems can cause other problems. When a disease
puts a strain on a relationship, any number of psychological troubles can sur-
face. For example, depression is common for people with a chronic disease.
Women can be anxious or paranoid, and they can lose self-esteem. A woman
may shut herself off from other people and become reclusive. These side
effects and other relational problems are all difficult to address.
Furthermore, surgeries such as hysterectomies and oophorectomies (removal
of the ovaries) can be psychologically damaging, leading to depression and
perceived loss of sexuality. Although placing a value on life’s pleasures is next
to impossible, the emotional and psychological costs of these losses (along
with the many short- and long-term complications of major surgery) are sub-
stantial and may be more devastating to a woman and her family than the
symptoms directly related to the disease.
20
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

We’re not saying that major surgery is always bad. Many women opt for this
course when the more conservative approaches have failed, and the majority
of women do well (see Chapter 11 for more info on the different types of surg-
eries). In fact, most patients who eventually have major surgery are ready for
it and happy with the results.
Do You Have Endometriosis: A Self-Test
Statistics are interesting, but you’re probably more concerned about whether
you have endometriosis than about the statistics. Although only your doctor
can diagnose endometriosis, the following questions help answer the ques-
tion: Do I have endometriosis? You don’t have to answer all the questions
with a “yes” to have endometriosis, but more than one or two “yes” answers
is a good reason to make an appointment with your doctor sooner rather
than later.
Questions
1. Do you have a family history of endometriosis?
2. Do you have painful periods?
3. Do you have pain during sex?
21
Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Endometriosis: A Quick Run-Through
One woman’s story: The high cost of endometriosis
One patient, Jane, had had 10 or 11 laparo-
scopies over the years for recurrent
endometriosis. She’d have relief after each one
for a year or two, but then the pain returned.
When she couldn’t function at work or socially,
she’d have another laparoscopy. Jane had also
tried all the conservative medical therapies
(GnRH agonist, NSAIDs, and hormones — we
cover all these in detail in Chapter 10) with
either no relief or too many side effects. Finally,
she demanded a hysterectomy and removal 
of the ovary that kept hurting, and she did 
feel better afterwards. Unfortunately, when 
the other ovary became a problem a couple 
of years later, she had several conservative 
surgeries to try and save it. Eventually it had 
to come out, and she is now symptom-free!
This story isn’t typical, but it illustrates the great
difficulty in assessing the cost of endometriosis
and its effect on a woman’s life. What was the
total cost to treat Jane, and what was the cost
of all the lost work days and life’s pleasures
while she was suffering? I don’t even want to
hazard a guess — it’s staggering!
Of course, for every story like Jane’s, another
story exists of a woman who continues to suffer
in silence or who has major surgery and then
always wonders whether it was the right
choice.

4. Are you having trouble getting pregnant?
5. Did you start having periods at a younger age than the norm?
6. Do your periods last longer than four to five days?
7. Do your periods come more often than every four weeks?
8. Do you have heavier than normal menstrual periods?
9. Do you have allergies or autoimmune diseases such as asthma?
10. Do you have painful urination during your period?
11. Do you have tummy troubles, such as diarrhea, constipation, or pain,
during your period?
12. Are you taller and thinner than average?
Answers
The following information provides some explanations for each question:
1. Endometriosis is more common in women whose close female relatives
have endometriosis.
2. Painful cramping during menstrual periods is the most common symp-
tom of endometriosis, although many women with cramps don’t have
endometriosis.
3. Endometriosis in the pelvis can make sex painful.
4. Thirty to forty percent of infertile women have endometriosis (see
Chapter 7 for more info).
5–8. Any factor that causes more menstrual bleeding over the course of your
lifetime is a risk factor for endometriosis. Women whose periods start at
a younger age and who have longer than normal periods, heavier than
normal periods, or periods closer than every four weeks are all more
likely to develop endometriosis.
9. Women with endometriosis are also more likely to have allergies or
other autoimmune diseases.
10. Endometriosis in the urinary tract can cause pain and bleeding.
11. Endometriosis in the intestines can cause pain, cramping, diarrhea, con-
stipation, or rectal bleeding during your period.
12. Women who are taller and thinner than average are more likely to have
endometriosis.
This test is just a starting point. If you’re concerned that you may have
endometriosis, don’t hesitate. Make an appointment with your gynecologist.

s something wrong with you, something you — and your doctors — can’t
put your collective fingers on? You may wonder whether endometriosis is
causing the symptoms that have been plaguing you. However, your symp-
toms seem so varied and elusive at times that you aren’t quite sure what’s
wrong.
In this chapter, we help you answer the question, “Could I have endometrio-
sis?” by discussing the most common symptoms of the disease. We also iden-
tify the less familiar problems of endometriosis so you can get a more
complete picture of this complex disease. Finally, we help you get a handle on
your specific situation by showing you how to keep a written record of symp-
toms (when they occur and under what circumstances) and other relevant
information. With these facts, you can give your doctor clear and accurate
descriptions that will help her help you.
Considering the Most Common 
Symptoms of Endometriosis
To say that endometriosis is a disease of many symptoms is an understate-
ment. Sometimes the symptoms you’re experiencing seem so odd and so
unconnected that you can’t believe they all relate to endometriosis.

In the next sections, we cover the most common symptoms of endometriosis
(listing the most common symptoms first), tell you what other diseases may
cause the same symptoms, and explain how endometriosis symptoms may
differ from those of other diseases. Don’t be disheartened by the length of
this list; few, if any, women with endometriosis have all these symptoms.
You’re more likely to have just a few.
Dealing with painful periods
If you have painful periods, you may or may not have endometriosis.
Endometriosis doesn’t necessarily cause painful periods (dysmenorrhea), so
this symptom doesn’t mean you definitely have endometriosis. In fact, up to
80 percent of all women experience painful periods at some time in their
lives. Around 10 percent experience pain severe enough to interfere with
normal activities, such as school or work. (See more about painful periods in
Chapter 5.)
If you do have painful periods, you may notice the following symptoms:
 Lower abdominal cramping
 Generalized pelvic pain
 Pain in the uterus due to contractions
 Back pain or leg pain
 Headaches
 Nausea, vomiting
 Diarrhea or constipation
 General body weakness
So how can you tell whether endometriosis is causing your painful periods?
You can’t. Cramping from endometriosis can occur before, during, or after
your period, and you can’t diagnose endometriosis by the type of cramping
you have; only your doctor can make a diagnosis between the two. Painful
cramps are just one symptom of endometriosis, and they’re only one piece of
a puzzle that makes up endometriosis. If you have painful pelvic cramping,
you need to see your gynecologist.
If you have painful periods, you don’t have to endure the agonizing pain any
longer. Check with your doctor for a diagnosis (check out Chapter 9 for more
on what your doctor will do to make a diagnosis). Even if your doctor rules
out endometriosis, she may be able to identify another cause for your painful
periods. Some other diseases that can cause painful periods include
24
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)
 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
 Fibroids
 Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
 Stenotic (narrow) cervix
 Uterine abnormalities
Hurtin’ for certain during sex
Pain during or after sex (dyspareunia) can cause more than physical prob-
lems. It can cause problems with your relationships, emotions, and self-
esteem (not to mention infertility from lack of sex). Up to 50 percent of
women experience dyspareunia at some time in their lives.
Dyspareunia is almost always a woman’s problem; men don’t usually experi-
ence it. Pain during sex from endometriosis is likely to cause the following
symptoms:
 Pain with deep penetration; pain may last several days after intercourse
 Pain more intense during menstrual period or ovulation
Because endometriosis isn’t the only condition that causes painful sex (check
out the nearby sidebar “More than endometriosis can cause painful sex” for
other conditions that may be causing your painful sex), how can you be cer-
tain that endometriosis is in fact causing your painful sex? Only your doctor
can determine the truth. Try to give your doctor clues to the exact problems
with your pain. He may ask questions such as:
 Have you always had pain with intercourse?
 Do you feel pain every time you have sex? If not, at what time in the
month do you feel pain during sex?
 Do you have vaginal dryness? Do you use any lubricants?
 Do you use spermicides or condoms?
 Where do you feel the pain? Is it on entry or more during deep thrusting;
on the outside, in the vagina, or in the pelvic area? Which side is the
pain on, or is it on both? Is it in the front, the back, or both? Is it in the
bladder or rectum?
 When do you feel the pain? Is it immediate, during, or after sex? And if
after, how long after?
25
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

 How long have you been sexually active?
 Have you had an abnormal pap smear?
 Have you had a venereal disease?
 Do you have bladder or intestinal problems?
 Do you have any history of sexual abuse?
 What medications are you taking?
These questions may be embarrassing for you, but we guarantee your doctor
has asked them a million times before, has heard a million different answers,
and won’t be surprised by anything you say. If he is surprised or shocked by
anything you say, he’ll have the good sense not to show it!
26
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
More than endometriosis can cause painful sex
Endometriosis doesn’t cause all painful sex
problems, so having painful sex doesn’t neces-
sarily mean you have endometriosis. A host of
other problems may be responsible, including
 Infections
 Pelvic organ infections (PID)
 Cervical infections
 Vaginal infections
 Vaginal irritation
 Dryness from decreased arousal or low
estrogen
 Allergic reaction to lubricants, condoms,
spermicides, deodorants, laundry deter-
gent, soaps, or douches
 Medications
 Pelvic muscle pain
 Vaginismus (muscles around the pelvis)
 Pelvic floor muscles
 Fibromyalgia
 Tenderness on the vulva (the outside of the
vagina)
 Vulvodynia (vulvar pain of unknown
cause)
 Vulvar infections
 Pelvic masses
 Uterine fibroids
 Ovarian cysts
 Pelvic scar tissue (including adhesions
from infection or surgery
 Bladder problems
 Urinary tract infection
 Interstitial cystitis (an inflammatory
bladder problem)
 Intestine and rectum problems
 Large intestine disorders, such as irrita-
ble bowel syndrome (IBS) or colitis
 Hemorrhoids
 Emotional issues

Dr. K. has had patients with many of these symptoms. Recently a patient had
problems getting pregnant. The main complaint was that sex was so painful
that she only rarely had sex. She also had bleeding with and after sex. These
symptoms were so disturbing to her and her partner (he was frightened and
thought he was damaging her) that they almost never had sex (and it’s hard to
get pregnant without it!). But the diagnosis was endometriosis that caused the
pain and bleeding and cervicitis (a cervical infection) that killed his sperm. 
Dr. K. treated the cervicitis, explained different positions for sex (to decrease
the discomfort endometriosis caused her), and told the couple about the
proper timing of ovulation. Success! They soon achieved a pregnancy.
Feeling mid-cycle pain
Mid-cycle pain occurs about two weeks before your next period begins. This
isn’t always halfway between periods, so the name is a bit of a misnomer. 
For example, if your period occurs every 22 days, mid-cycle pain actually
occurs around Day 8. If your period comes every 36 days, mid-cycle 
pain occurs around Day 24.
About 20 percent of women experience mid-cycle pain at some time in their
lives; the pain usually lasts only a few minutes to a few hours. Women may
confuse it with appendicitis when it occurs on the right side. A better name
for mid-cycle pain is ovulatory pain because it usually occurs around the time
of ovulation.
Mid-cycle pain related to endometriosis may cause all the same symptoms, but
they usually get more intense and last longer over time. Most of the other rea-
sons for mid-cycle pain don’t show consistent progression of intensity and dura-
tion (check out the nearby sidebar “Identifying other causes of mid-cycle pain”).
Experiencing abnormal bleeding
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), sometimes called dysfunctional uterine
bleeding (DUB), is any vaginal bleeding that is irregular or heavier than
normal. (See Chapter 5 for more about AUB.) Endometriosis-induced AUB is
often caused by a hormone imbalance. This imbalance may be the result of
endometriosis on the ovaries, and it can cause the following conditions
(Chapter 7 covers these further):
 Problems with follicular development
 Luteal phase defect
 Ovulatory dysfunction
 Association with thyroid disease
 Destruction of ovarian tissue
27
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

Because the cause of AUB is often a hormone imbalance, doctors generally
treat AUB first with hormones (after other causes have been eliminated). The
hormones can be birth control pills (which are simple to use, familiar to most
women, and relatively cheap) or other hormones, like progestins. The hor-
mone or combination depends on many factors, including your doctor’s pref-
erence and his assessment of what will work best for your particular
problem.
Conceiving problems
Endometriosis is a common cause of infertility. In fact, 30 to 40 percent of
infertile women have endometriosis. But that figure also means that 60 per-
cent of patients with fertility issues don’t have endometriosis, so infertility
isn’t a sure sign of endometriosis.
If you’re having trouble getting pregnant, have your doctor first consider
endometriosis as a possible cause in any fertility workup. Endometriosis can
interfere with pregnancy in a large number of ways, such as
 Blocked fallopian tubes
 Hormone imbalances
 Implantation issues
 Production of ovarian cysts
See Chapter 7 for all the info you’ll ever need on getting pregnant when you
have endometriosis.
28
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Identifying other causes of mid-cycle pain
Although mid-cycle pain is sometimes associ-
ated with endometriosis, many women without
endometriosis experience it as well. Other
causes of mid-cycle pain are
 Ovulation: The release of the follicular fluid
or blood from the ruptured follicle can
cause this pain (sometimes called mittel-
schmertz, which is German for middle pain)
 Ovarian cysts: From rupture, leakage, or
stretching
 Ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovary): Can
be caused by large ovarian cysts
 Hormonal fluctuations: May cause spasms
in the uterus, intestines, or bladder muscles

Experiencing chronic pain
Pain that occurs frequently and regularly is, unfortunately, a hallmark of many
diseases. Unlike acute pain, which occurs after a specific insult or injury, fol-
lows an expected timetable, and then disappears, chronic pain hangs around.
Note: Although chronic pain may follow an injury (such as back pain), chronic
pain may also indicate a chronic illness, such as endometriosis. As many as
one in three Americans experience some type of chronic pain; some of the
most common are headaches, back pain, muscle pain, and nerve pain.
The most common type of chronic pain from endometriosis is, not surpris-
ingly, pelvic pain. Pelvic pain accounts for about 20 percent of all gynecolo-
gist appointments, and it’s the reason for nearly half of all laparoscopies.
Nearly two-thirds of patients with chronic pelvic pain are found to have
endometriosis during laparoscopy; this percentage may increase as better
visualization techniques during laparoscopy are developed.
29
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms
Considering other causes of abnormal 
uterine bleeding
Although endometriosis can cause abnormal
uterine bleeding (AUB), a large number of unre-
lated problems can also cause AUB. Some of
these causes are
 Adenomyosis, a condition where the lining
of the uterus (the endometrium) gets into
the muscle wall of the uterus.
 Hormone imbalances
 Polycystic ovarian syndrome
 Taking hormones
 Hypothyroidism
 Medications
 Food supplements
 Uterus problems
 Fibroids
 Infection inside the uterus (endometritis)
 Uterine cancer
 Cervical problems
 Polyps (a fleshy, noncancerous growth)
 Cervical infection (cervicitis)
 Cervical precancer or cancer
 Intrauterine device (an IUD)
 Injury to the vagina or cervix
In order to make sure you have endometriosis
and not one of these other problems, consult
with your doctor.

Chronic pain is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Many women just live with
the pain because they
 Think their doctor won’t believe them
 Think chronic pain is a sign of weakness
 Have been treated like drug addicts when they asked for help
 Don’t want to take opioids
 Are afraid to take too many over-the-counter medications
 Feel that chronic pain is untreatable
If you’re suffering from chronic pelvic pain, check with your gynecologist. 
She can run the necessary tests (see Chapter 9 for diagnostic tests used in
endometriosis) to determine whether endometriosis is causing your chronic
pain. Other conditions besides endometriosis, such as the following, can also
cause pelvic pain:
 Adhesions
 Pelvic inflammatory disease
 Fibroids
 Hernias
 Interstitial cystitis
 Irritable bowel syndrome
Your doctor can determine whether endometriosis or another condition is
the reason for your chronic pain.
Facing autoimmune issues
Many studies support the idea that women with endometriosis are more
likely than most to suffer from autoimmune diseases. With autoimmune 
diseases, the body makes antibodies that attack healthy organs or tissues,
thereby causing disease. About 75 percent of the people with an autoimmune
disease are women, and the disease often starts during the childbearing
years.
Many autoimmune diseases exist, but researchers believe women with the
following autoimmune diseases are also more likely to have endometriosis:
30
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 Allergies
 Asthma
 Chronic fatigue syndrome
 Fibromyalgia
 Lupus
 Multiple sclerosis
 Rheumatoid arthritis
 Thyroid disease
Is endometriosis itself an autoimmune disease? Many scientists think so. 
(See Chapter 4 for more on autoimmune disease and endometriosis.) One
study showed that as many as 28 percent of women with endometriosis had a
positive response to an anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) blood test. This test indi-
cates the presence of antibodies that cause inflammatory responses against a
person’s own cells (in other words, an autoimmune reaction).
Being tired all the time
Are you tired all the time? Ten percent of people say they are. No wonder the
coffee houses are doing so well! Feeling tired can have physical or mental
causes, and often it can be a combination of the two. Endometriosis can cer-
tainly cause exhaustion. In fact, in one large study of women with
endometriosis, exhaustion was the second most common symptom.
The reasons for the extreme tiredness that sometimes comes with
endometriosis aren’t clear. Some theories explain exhaustion as
 Part of the autoimmune process
 A reaction to constant inflammation
 The result of stress from dealing with frequent pain
Endometriosis obviously isn’t the only condition that causes extreme fatigue.
Check out the nearby sidebar “Looking at other conditions that cause
fatigue” for more info.

Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

Noting the Not-Quite-As-Common
Symptoms of Endometriosis
Although most people think of pelvic problems first when they think of
endometriosis, endometrial tissue can travel quite a distance from the pelvis
to wreak havoc in other areas of your body. In the next sections, we take a
look at some not-quite-as-common symptoms related to endometriosis.
Living with your bowels in an uproar
There’s nothing like bowel problems to keep you hopping. If your primary
planning tool for vacations is the proximity of a bathroom at all times, you’re
not alone! Whether your problem is diarrhea, nausea, or constipation, rest
assured that many women share your problems.
Endometriosis is one cause of bowel problems, but it’s certainly not the only
one. Around 10 percent of women with endometriosis have bowel problems
caused by endometriosis.
One way to determine whether bowel problems are related to endometriosis
is to keep track of their timing. Bowel symptoms from endometriosis are
more likely to occur around the time of your periods and can include
32
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Looking at other conditions that cause fatigue
Although endometriosis and fatigue often go
hand in hand, many other conditions can cause
extreme tiredness, such as
 Lack of sleep: About half of all Americans
claim sleep deprivation at any given time.
 Anemia: A decrease in red blood cells can
cause fatigue and weakness.
 Chronic fatigue syndrome: Chronic fatigue
can make even the smallest day-to-day
functions difficult.
 Depression: People who are depressed are
four times more likely to be fatigued.
 Fibromyalgia: Characteristics of this
chronic illness are widespread muscle
aches and fatigue.
 Poor nutrition: Lack of essential nutrients
can cause weakness and fatigue.
 Many medications: Fatigue is a side effect
of many medications.
 Other diseases, such as hypothyroidism:
Fatigue is a common side effect of illness.
If you’re fatigued, make sure you check with
your doctor for a complete exam.

 Diarrhea
 Constipation
 Nausea
 Rectal bleeding
 Bloating
 Stabbing rectal pain
 Increased gas
 Abdominal pain
See Chapter 6 for more on the way endometriosis affects your bowels.
Recognizing urinary symptoms
You may not think much about your urinary tract — until you have a problem
with it. Endometriosis can be the cause of many bladder irritations, from
blood in the urine to urgency. Ten to 20 percent of women with endometriosis
have bladder issues.
Some symptoms of endometriosis in the bladder are
 Flank pain
 Pain with sex
 Urinary frequency
 Urinary urgency
 Burning or pain with urination
 Urinary retention
 Blood in the urine
 Fever
Check out Chapter 6 for more on how endometriosis can affect your urinary
tract.
Coping with respiratory symptoms
When you think of endometriosis, you probably don’t even consider breath-
ing issues, right? However, for a small number of women with endometriosis,
respiratory problems may be a big part of their symptoms each month.
33
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

Suspecting endometriosis when you’re coughing up blood or having chest
pains each month may seem a little ridiculous, but endometriosis can cause
these symptoms if it lodges in your lungs. Endometriosis can occur in the
lining of the lung (the pleura) or in the lung itself. Endometriosis in the pleura
is about five times more common than in the lung, and the majority of occur-
rences are on the right side.
Pleural endometriosis causes the following:
 Shortness of breath
 Pain
 Collapsed lung (pneumothorax)
 Fluid on the lung (pleural effusion)
Endometriosis in the lung (parenchymal endometriosis) causes you to cough
up blood. (Flip to Chapter 6 for more on how endometriosis can affect the
lungs.)
Endometriosis is obviously not the first problem you should suspect if you
have breathing difficulties. Many diseases can cause respiratory issues,
including
 Asthma
 Respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia
 Pleurisy or pneumothorax unrelated to endometriosis
Differentiating endometriosis of the respiratory system from other causes
can be difficult and may require an MRI or surgery (see Chapter 9 for more on
diagnosing endometriosis in the lungs). Interestingly, women with
endometriosis also seem more likely to have asthma.
Minding endometriosis and the brain
Endometriosis of the brain, like endometriosis of the lungs, is uncommon. If
you have symptoms such as headaches and seizures, other causes are far
more likely than endometriosis. However, rare cases of endometriosis affect-
ing the brain do exist.
Women with endometriosis are, according to some studies, more prone to
migraine headaches than women without endometriosis. This connection
may be due to prostaglandins (chemicals released from the uterus during
your period) rather than endometrial lesions in the brain. (Check out 
Chapter 6 for more on how endometriosis can affect the brain.)

Writing It Down: How a Diary Can Help
Most patients are notoriously bad at describing their problems to medical
personnel; “out of sight” and “out of mind” seem to describe many people’s
attitudes toward their symptoms. The average exchange between doctor or
nurse and patient often goes like this:
Doctor/Nurse: “When was your last menstrual period?”
Patient: “Oh, I think it was two weeks ago Thursday, because I remember I
was at the mall, and, no, wait, it wasn’t Thursday. It was Tuesday, because
I had that meeting — no, that was the month before, because I forgot to
bring tampons with me, and. . . .”
Doctor/Nurse: “When does the pain usually begin?”
Patient: “Well, I guess it starts right before my period, well, not right
before but maybe a few days before — sometimes a week before. . .and
sometimes it lasts after my period stops, but not always, and then. . . .”
Do you see why doctors can get frustrated when trying to take a history?
Patients don’t remember important details about their experiences. Some
patients are exceptions to this rule. For example, a patient may come in with a
medical tome the size of New York’s phone book that describes in detail every
twinge she’s had in the last month. There’s such a thing as too much detail!
We hope you can come in with medical information that’s neither too much
nor too little, but just right. The right amount of information helps your doctor
diagnose and treat you without getting bogged down in insignificant details.
How can you remember what’s important? The best way is to keep a diary
that can help you keep track of everything: your symptoms and your men-
strual cycle, the pain and your feelings. Why a diary you ask? Because most
people are too busy to remember every single pain they have each month.
You can make your doctor a very happy woman and give her the accurate
information she needs to treat you. You may not have kept a diary since
grade school, but this section helps you get started so your next trip to the
doctor’s office isn’t a guessing game.
Recording symptoms (and everything 
else important) from month to month
Keeping records in a diary is important to help your doctor make a diagnosis
and develop a treatment plan for you. Diaries are practical for recording
symptoms as well as all other important pieces of information because they
35
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

provide dates and can cover a 12-month time period. The only way to see a
trend in your symptoms (and feelings) is to record them for several months
in a row. Pain can have many causes, and a pain that occurs once and never
shows up again isn’t likely to be endometriosis.
You don’t have to be elaborate in your diary; a simple laundry list of symp-
toms is adequate. But you can really have fun buying a diary or journal —
check out bookstores for some great ones. In fact, buying a diary to record
your symptoms is probably the only fun aspect of having endometriosis, so
get the most out of it!
After a few months, you may start to see trends that you haven’t noticed
before. Maybe you never recognized a cycle to the diarrhea that shows up
three days before your period every month, or you never realized that you
always have a headache right before your period starts. The cough that
always shows up with your period may seem more significant when you 
realize that it’s a monthly occurrence.
Now when you go to see your doctor, you can give him a concise list of your
symptoms and their timing. Make sure you keep track of the items that are
listed in the following sections.
Keeping track of your menstrual cycle
Now that you have a diary, you have no excuse for not knowing when your
last period was, how long it lasted, how heavy it was, and what other symp-
toms occurred at the same time. Probably the last time you paid attention to
menstrual flow so faithfully was in high school!
Knowing how long your period lasts, how heavy it is (yes, a tampon or pad
count is acceptable and very helpful), and how many days are between the
start of one cycle and the start of the next can be helpful for your doctor,
especially if you’re dealing with infertility issues.
Rating your pain
When you record pain, try to rate it. (Awful isn’t a rating!) Rating pain on a
scale from one to ten — with one being the least and ten the most pain 
possible — is effective, and doctors are familiar with that sort of pain scale.
Children learn to rate pain by pointing to a face that best expresses how
they’re feeling; you may want to amuse your doctor by taking a pain chart
like this. If you’re artistic, you can even draw your own faces to express what
you’re feeling!
36
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

In addition to rating the pain, you need to describe it. You don’t have to get
too graphic — if your description sounds like it came out of a cheap novel,
you’ve probably gotten too dramatic. Keep it simple by using the following
words or similar terms: “The pain is. . .”
 Aching
 Building over time
 Burning
 Coming in waves
 Constant
 Dull
 Intense
 Intermittent
 Stabbing
Locating your pain
Knowing the location of your pain is just as important as knowing the kind of
pain you’re having. This description isn’t as easy as it sounds. Pain is easy to
locate when you feel it, but when it’s gone, pain is hard to pinpoint. One way
to mark the spot is with a magic marker (but marking it every day after your
shower isn’t really practical).
You don’t have to be a great artist to make a sketch of your abdomen, back,
or wherever you feel pain. Mark the painful spot on your drawing — or, better
yet, just make a photocopy of a woman’s body out of an anatomy book and
mark the painful spots with an X.
Keeping track of the exact location of your pain will help over a few months.
The pain that you thought was in the same spot every month may actually
move from side to side!
Homing in on your feelings
In addition to recording your symptoms, pain, and how often they occur, you
also need to record your feelings. Keeping track of your mood swings and
your feelings may be more helpful to you than to your doctor, who doesn’t
live with you. You can devise a simple system to evaluate your daily moods,
or you can go into great detail, especially if you’re an aspiring novelist.
Wording doesn’t matter — the pattern does.
37
Chapter 2: Suspecting Endometriosis: Defining the Symptoms

You can be as detailed as you care to be, although minute-by-minute mood
descriptions will probably make for boring reading! A better way may be to
capture your overall mood day-by-day. For example, were you unusually
tired, out of sorts, achy, angry, or sleepy? Over time, you may see a pattern
emerge so you can predict your mood changes ahead of time — and take
measures to keep them under control.
Being aware of mood swings and feelings can help you plan big events in your
life, such as weddings and vacations. No one wants to go to Hawaii at a time
of the month when she knows she’s going to feel somewhat depressed. On
the other hand, perhaps Hawaii is just what you need to cheer yourself up!
Plotting your energy levels
Knowing your energy levels over time can also be helpful in planning your
life. Although you may have some month-to-month variations, recording your
energy levels can guide you on what activities you can reasonably expect to
do and when you can do them. For example, a marathon in the middle of your
exhaustion time probably won’t work well.
Listing your pain treatments — 
both the good and the bad
Keep a record of what treatment decreases your pain. If you don’t track your
successes and failures, you may walk out of your doctor’s office with a list of
basic medications and exercises to try. This list is fine, unless you’ve been
trying these methods without any decrease in pain for the last three months.
Obviously, rehashing the same ineffective treatment isn’t a good plan!
Many women are hesitant to speak up and tell a doctor that his suggestions
haven’t worked. Don’t hesitate to simply say, “I tried that already and it 
doesn’t work.” Better yet, give him a list upfront of the treatments you’ve
tried already so he won’t suggest the same ones. When your doctor can see
what you have (and haven’t) done, he can provide different medications and
exercises to help decrease the pain.

 Examining female biology
 Understanding how endometriosis affects your reproductive system and other organs
T
he human body is amazing, and the female reproductive system is one of
the most amazing parts of all. You may not have a good understanding of
what exactly goes on in there — you may have spent sex education class
hiding your head under your school desk and giggling with your friends.
This chapter fills in the gaps with knowledge about the female anatomy and
physiology. In this chapter, we also explain what endometriosis consists of
and how the condition affects different reproductive and surrounding organs.
Getting Back to Basics: Bio 101 
of Female Anatomy
Whoever said “It’s what’s inside that counts” was right. How your body func-
tions has very little to do with what you see on the outside — it’s all about
what goes on in the places you can’t see. In the case of the female body, you
may be familiar with many parts and their names, but maybe you’re a little
hazy on their exact locations and functions. So, to understand endometriosis,
you first need to understand your reproductive system and the organs that
surround it. Figure 3-1 is a picture that’s worth a thousand words.

This section contains a part-by-part description of your reproductive system
and nearby organs that endometriosis can affect.
The uterus: Your womb
The uterus, commonly called the womb, is where babies are nourished and
grow for about nine months in a pregnant woman.
In women who have never been pregnant, the uterus is almost flat, but after a
woman has been pregnant, her uterus becomes more pear-shaped. A uterus
has three layers of tissue:
 The thin outer lining of the uterus is the serosa, (sometimes called the
visceral peritoneum). This layer is part of the lining of the pelvic walls,
abdominal cavity, and the intestines, forming a large area of covering
tissue called the peritoneum.
 The middle part, or bulk, of the uterus is a muscle called the myometrium.
This muscle causes the cramps (little contractions) women feel with
their period or other bleeding, and it’s responsible for the contractions
of labor.

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

The inside of the uterus is hollow and is a potential space, which means
that normally there’s no space between the walls of the uterus; they
actually touch each other.
 The innermost part of the uterus, the endometrium, grows along the
inside walls of the uterus. But, when pieces of the endometrium go out-
side the uterus, you have endometriosis.
The endometrium consists of glands (tiny tubes that secrete fluid and
proteins, similar to saliva glands) and two layers of stroma (supporting
tissue). The stroma is very vascular, which means it has many blood 
vessels. The two layers of stroma are
• The stratum basalis, the thin inner layer that remains after each
menstrual period and grows for the next cycle.
• The stratum functionalis, which grows from the basalis. This layer
(containing glands, blood vessels, and surface epithelial cells)
thickens and then is sloughed off (shed) during a menstrual
period.
The inside walls of the uterus normally touch each other, except when some-
thing’s inside the uterus — like a baby! Then the area inside the uterus
expands as the baby does.
The uterine ligaments: The stabilizers
When discussing your uterus, we can’t forget to mention the ligaments, or
bands of cordlike tissue, which help keep the uterus in place, sort of like sta-
bilizers. Refer to Figure 3-1 to see the relationship of the uterus to the other
female reproductive parts and nearby organs. The fundus, or body of the
uterus, sits somewhat upright (with a bend to the front or back) in the middle
of the pelvic cavity, and the cervix, which is the opening of the uterus, pro-
trudes into the top of the vagina.
Your uterus has three sets of ligaments that help keep the uterus from sliding
around, including
 Two round ligaments at the top of the uterus on either side.
 Two uterosacral ligaments at the top of the cervix, where it meets the
lower fundus (the bottom of the body of the uterus). These ligaments
attach from the cervix to the sacrum (the bony end of the spine).
 Two lateral (broad) ligaments between the other two, stronger sets of
ligaments. The broad ligaments are folded, flat pieces of tissue.
41
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

These three sets of ligaments consist of firm, fibrous tissue. Although the liga-
ments have a small amount of give so the uterus can move slightly, nerves
running through these ligaments are often sensitive to too much stretch or
movement. The cervical end of the ligaments has a collection of nerve end-
ings called the paracervical ganglion (a ganglion is a group of neurons).
The ovaries: Your egg producers
The ovaries, which produce the eggs, are very near the fallopian tubes (see
the next section and refer to Figure 3-1 for their location). This close proxim-
ity between the ovaries and fallopian tubes makes sense because eggs need
to travel down the fallopian tubes to get to the uterus — where they can
implant and grow into 7-pound bundles of joy.
The fallopian tubes: Your conveyor belts
The fallopian tubes are attached to the uterus — one on each side. These
passages are like personal conveyor belts, transporting an egg from the
ovary to the uterus. If sperm are present, the egg is fertilized at the end of the
tube near the ovary. But, if there’s any disruption along the path, a fertilized
egg can’t make its way to the uterus to implant.
Although fallopian tubes don’t touch the ovaries directly, they have fimbriae
(very fine, fingerlike projections on the end nearest the ovary) that coax the
newly released egg into the fallopian tube. Their function is essential in this
conveyor-belt process of getting pregnant because, if a fertilized egg floats
away and doesn’t get into the tube, it can result in an ectopic pregnancy, a
pregnancy that implants a fertilized egg outside the uterus, usually in the fal-
lopian tubes. (Check out Chapter 7 where we discuss this situation in depth.)
The vagina and cervix: The openings
The vagina is the muscular opening that leads from the external female geni-
tals to the cervix, which is the mouth, or neck, of the uterus. Functioning as a
passage between the endometrial cavity (the layer lining the inside of the
uterus) and the vagina, the cervix is usually open just enough to let men-
strual flow out and sperm in. During pregnancy, the cervix closes to keep
your baby from falling out.
42
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Other important parts
The female body has other important parts that can play a role in endometrio-
sis. Note: Although males have some of the parts listed in this section,
endometriosis generally only affects females (see Chapter 1 for the very rare
exception of a male with endometriosis). The following body parts can be
involved:
 The pelvic cavity is the space between the pelvic bones (which wrap
around from the pubic bone in front to the sacrum, or tailbone, in back).
The cavity holds the reproductive organs, bladder, and rectum. In addi-
tion, large amounts of small and large intestines move in and out of the
pelvic cavity during digestion.
As we mention earlier in this section, the lining of this cavity is called
the peritoneum, which is a thin layer of cells that prevents all these
organs from sticking to each other.
 Other important areas in your pelvic cavity:
• The posterior cul-de-sac sounds like a nice place to live (no traf-
fic!), but it’s a dead end, literally, behind the uterus. The cervix, top
of the vagina, rectum, and uterosacral ligaments (see the earlier
section “The uterine ligaments: The stabilizers”) all come together
at the bottom of the posterior cul-de-sac.
• The anterior cul-de-sac is between the pubic bone and the uterus.
Also, the bladder is at the bottom of the anterior cul-de-sac.
 The bladder is the storage unit for urine. Urine comes down from the
kidneys via the ureters (tubes) and collects in your bladder until you
have a convenient and socially acceptable time to empty it.
 The rectum makes up the last few inches of the large intestine. Lying
behind the uterus and in front of the sacrum, the rectum connects the
large intestine to the anus (the final destination of the digestive tract and
the body’s exit point).
 The large and small intestines (bowels) aren’t restricted to females;
males obviously have them, too. But, because of their proximity to the
pelvis, the intestines are common sites for endometriosis. (The names
small and large may seem somewhat backwards because the uncoiled
small intestine is about 20 feet long, or three to four times longer than
the large intestine, which is only 5 feet long.)
Both the small and large intestines can move in and out of both cul-de-
sacs and float around in the pelvic cavity.
43
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

The small intestine fills the area from the bottom of your ribs to the top
of the uterus and connects the stomach to the large intestine.
Meanwhile, the large intestine makes a lot of turns before reaching the
anus. Starting just below the right side of the umbilicus (belly button),
the intestine winds up toward the rib cage, makes a left turn to cross
under the ribs, and takes another left to continue along the left side of
the abdominal cavity and downward toward the pelvis.
 The appendix is a small, fingerlike projection near the junction of the
large and small intestines.
Measuring How Endometriosis Affects
Your Reproductive and Other Organs
Endometriosis lesions can act and look differently in different areas, but all
are detrimental. In addition, the amount of endometriosis isn’t always an indi-
cator of the damage or pain it causes; a little endometriosis in one location
can be much more damaging and painful than a lot of endometriosis some-
where else. In fact, doctors have known for a long time that the amount of vis-
ible endometriosis has very little bearing on the symptoms. In this section,
we discuss the ways endometriosis can damage different organs. (See
Chapter 7 to find out how these changes can affect your fertility.)
44
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Finding endometriosis in unexpected places
I have seen some strange cases where pelvic
endometriosis causes seemingly unrelated
symptoms. A patient had right-side pain at the
level of her umbilicus (belly button) and multiple
intestinal symptoms, such as nausea, constipa-
tion, and pain after eating. She had a previous
diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or
some other inflammatory bowel disease, but
when she didn’t receive any relief from other
treatments, she turned to me. After much dis-
cussion, she decided on laparoscopy to try and
determine the cause for her problems. Very
unexpectedly, I found severe endometriosis; her
intestines were stuck to her uterus and right
ovary, and her appendix was literally stuck to
the top of her uterus! After I cut down the adhe-
sions and removed the appendix, her intestinal
symptoms resolved.

Endometriosis and your fallopian tubes
Endometriosis can implant on the outside surface of the fallopian tubes and
cause scarring. Just like burn scars can lead to contractures that distort limbs
and other body parts, the endometriosis scarring can distort the fallopian
tubes so they can’t function properly.
How endometriosis blocks your tubes
Endometriosis inside the fallopian tube can partially or totally block that
tube. This blockage may cause infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Unfortunately,
even good imaging techniques, such as X-rays or ultrasounds, can’t see
inside the tubes. Likewise, during surgery, doctors have a difficult time seeing
directly in the narrow tubes because the instruments used to view the pelvic
cavity are too big to enter the tubes.
Endometrial implants can also disrupt the function of the fimbriae (which
means fringe in Latin), the ends of the tubes that pick up the egg. Endometri-
osis can cause these fine, delicate fimbriae to stick to each other or other
structures. In the worst-case scenario, these tiny fingers are destroyed and
lose all function. In that case, the chance for pregnancy in general is greatly
reduced, but the risk of an ectopic pregnancy is high.
Even if the fimbriae aren’t destroyed, any decrease in their functionality can
lead to problems. For example, endometriosis may cause them to stick to the
ovary, tube, uterus, intestines, or pelvic wall, so they can’t move around to
pick up an egg. Inflamed fimbriae can also be painful and can cause addi-
tional pain by adhering to another structure. This pain may be the result of
the stuck tube pulling as a woman goes about normal activity. (Remember,
tubes are usually free and can move around a bit.)
What blocks your tubes
Endometrial implants can totally block the fallopian tube by forming scar
tissue that destroys the fimbriae and sticks these tiny fingers together. As
these delicate fingers become distorted and stuck, the end of the tube can
close off, literally, keeping sperm and egg separated.
The following three substances can damage a fallopian tube:
 Blood: A blocked tube filled with blood (from endometriosis in the tube
or some other reason) is called a hematosalpinx (hemato means blood
and salpinx means tubes). Visually, a hematosalpinx can look similar to
an ectopic pregnancy.
 Inflammatory fluid: Endometriosis that totally blocks the tube near the
fimbriae can lead to a swollen, chronically inflamed fallopian tube called
a hydrosalpinx. (Hydro means fluid.)
45
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

Imagine a water balloon with fluid coming in and filling the balloon
(tube). Because the end is closed, the balloon swells up. The inflamma-
tory fluid in a blocked fallopian tube contains many chemicals, cells, and
tissue that cause inflammation, which can lead to pain, fever, infertility,
and even miscarriage.
 Pus: Infection is another common cause of tubal blockage, although it’s
not a result of endometriosis. When an infection results in tubal block-
age and it fills with pus, it’s called a pyosalpinx.
All three of the salpinxes (substances) can cause pain because a tube is
swollen and stretched — and all of these conditions are obvious causes of
infertility. (Just like having your tubes tied, the sperm and egg can’t meet.)
Check out Figure 3-2 for examples of how endometriosis can affect the fallop-
ian tubes.
Endometriosis and your ovaries
Endometriosis is common on the surface of the ovaries, but it can also invade
the meat, or interior, of the ovary. This section looks at the three ways
endometriosis can affect the ovaries.

46
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

On the ovary’s surface
The fact that the surface of the ovary is a very common site for endometrio-
sis makes sense, because retrograde menstrual flow coming out of the tube
spills right onto the ovaries. (Check out Chapter 4 for more on retrograde
menstruation.) This endometrial tissue can implant onto the surface of the
ovary and do all sorts of damage.
Endometriosis can also start directly from the surface cells of the ovary by a
process called metaplasia. The resulting implants can be on any part of the
ovary and cause the same problems that retrograde spills produce. (Check
out Chapter 4 for more on metaplasia.)
When endometriosis develops on the surface of the ovary by retrograde 
menstruation or metaplasia, the inflammatory process begins and leads to
adhesions (scar tissue). As a result, the ovary can become stuck to the tube,
uterus, intestines, or pelvic wall. These adhesions (check out Figure 3-3) can
cause pain and problems with the intestines and they can cause infertility.

Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

In the most severe cases, all contents of the pelvis — such as the uterus, 
fallopian tubes, and intestines — can be stuck together in a frozen pelvis. In
addition to causing pain and problems with the intestines, these adhesions
can cause infertility.
Forming painful cysts
Another severe problem is endometrioma (cysts) inside the ovary. These
cysts (see Figure 3-4) are a result of inflamed endometrial tissue implants on
the ovary surface that develop scar tissue (to wall off the implants like a
pimple). But this dense, firm scarring causes the endometriosis implants
(lesions) to take the path of least resistance — into the stroma (the relatively
softer ovarian tissue).
Over time these cysts fill with endometrial tissue and old blood. A more
appetizing name for these cysts is chocolate cyst because their dark brown
fluid looks like liquid chocolate. If the cysts burst, the contents spill out into
the pelvic cavity and can cause severe pain. In this case, because the fluid is
highly inflammatory, scar tissue can also form in the pelvic cavity. Other
structures or organs in contact with the fluid can also stick to it. The results
can be dramatic and severe.

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

These cysts continue to grow each month because their endometrial tissue,
which responds to menstrual cycle hormones, deposits more and more
tissue implants and blood into the cysts each month. As these cysts enlarge,
they put pressure, literally, on normal ovary tissue, distorting it and often
making the tissue unrecognizable. Worse yet, the ever-increasing pressure
actually destroys the normal tissue of the ovary. This loss of functioning
ovarian tissue significantly decreases the number and function of primordial
follicles, or future eggs (we cover the menstrual cycle in detail in Chapter 5),
causing infertility and early menopause.
Resulting in LUF
Endometriosis may also result in luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome
(LUF). With LUF, an egg has developed inside the follicle (the fluid-filled sac
that the egg develops in) to supposed maturity and is ready to be released
into the world (so to speak!). But for some reason, the egg never leaves the
ovary. Obviously, an egg that stays in its follicle can’t be fertilized, so LUF
leads to infertility. But what causes this failure of the egg to leave its home?
Doctors don’t really know. Again, the body is wonderfully complex, and the
series of events leading to follicle rupture are many. Any one of the following
processes may cause LUF:
 Scar tissue from endometriosis surrounding the ovary can physically
prevent release of the egg.
 The presence of endometriosis can interfere with the surface of the
ovary in the usual cascade of events that leads to ovulation.
 Some women are prone to endometriosis; LUF may be a marker of the
defect that causes endometriosis.
Doctors really aren’t sure what causes LUF. It’s the chicken-and-egg story.
That is, do some women have a problem that causes LUF and endometriosis,
or does the endometriosis cause the LUF? (See Chapter 7 for more on LUF
and how the menstrual cycle works.)
Endometriosis and your pelvic cavity
Endometriosis that implants on the peritoneum in the pelvic cavity (see
Figure 3-5) can cause severe inflammation that leads to adhesions or scar
tissue. These adhesions can then cause all these organs and tissues — the
uterus, ovaries, tubes, intestines, and bladder — to stick to each other so
they don’t move in the usual manner. This restriction of movement and the
inflammation due to endometriosis cause the pain or discomfort. In addition,
these same adhesions can make the intestines, bladder, and reproductive
organs malfunction.
49
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

Looking closer at the pain
Endometrial implants in the pelvic cavity can result in scar tissue, which
binds organs and tissue together. When the tissues and organs stick together,
movement (such as occurs during sexual intercourse) results in pain. The
eventual result may be a frozen pelvis, which is as bad as it sounds.
The local inflammation produces irritating chemicals, which also cause pain.
Likewise, stretching of the lining and irritation of the nerves are painful.
Endometriosis in the pelvic cavity can cause pain in several ways:
 Nerve endings on the surface of the peritoneum can be stimulated by
endometrial tissue to cause discomfort. As the endometrial implants
grow into deeper tissue, they may affect larger, more significant nerve
fibers that course through the pelvic cavity toward the vulva, buttock,
and legs.
 Endometriosis may simply irritate these nerves or actually entrap them,
causing even more bizarre symptoms, such as back and leg pain, loss of
feeling in the legs, vulvar discomfort, and other lower extremity symp-
toms. (Check out Chapter 2 for more information on the symptoms of
endometriosis.)

 Pelvic wall endometrial lesions can rupture. The fluid released contains
many irritants that lead to pelvic pain.
 Fluid entering the pelvis from a ruptured endometrioma can lead to
pain. This fluid is very caustic to the surrounding structures.
 Endometrial tissue at menstruation can cause pain. Because
endometriosis has the same tissue, it causes chemical changes and
affects the peritoneum to cause pain.
 Enlargement of endometrial implants on organs and the peritoneum can
cause swelling, stretching, and pressure.
 Scar tissue causes pain when structures stick together in unnatural ways.
(Chapter 13 shows you how you can manage the physical pain associated
with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity — and everywhere else!)
Endometriosis and your uterine ligaments
Because endometriosis tends to fall into the bottom of the pelvic cavity, the
uterine ligaments are a common spot for endometriosis to implant (check 
out “The uterine ligaments: The stabilizers” earlier in this chapter for more
about these ligaments). When endometriosis implants on the ligaments 
(refer to Figure 3-5), it grows into the peritoneal covering and then into the
ligament fibers. This invasion causes the same inflammatory response doc-
tors see in other organs and tissues, such as in arthritis or strained muscles
and ligaments.
Usually the endometriosis becomes firm and feels like nodules. In fact, the
uterus can feel fixed (without its usual mobility) on exam because the liga-
ments have lost their small amount of elasticity. The nodules can also cause
pain when touched because they’re inflamed. So the firm feeling of the nod-
ules, along with pain and the decrease in uterine movement, may suggest
endometriosis to your doctor.
Endometriosis causes a variety of reactions in the tissues. One response 
is inflammation, which may scar and eventually shorten the ligament. This
inflammation also irritates ligament nerves, so even normal movement of the
uterus during sex or routine activity is painful. In contrast, healthy uterosacral
ligaments normally stretch a little and keep the uterus in position without
pain during these activities.
Endometriosis and the cul-de-sacs
This section heading may sound more like a catchy name for a 1960s singing
group than a discussion about endometriosis! Of the two cul-de-sacs in the
pelvis, endometriosis is more common in the posterior than in the anterior,
but both locations have their share of problems. Check out Figure 3-5 for 
a clear picture of how endometriosis affects your posterior and anterior 
cul-de-sacs.
51
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

A prime location: The posterior cul-de-sac
The posterior cul-de-sac, often referred to as the dead end of the pelvis, is at
the very bottom of the pelvis. Due to gravity (assuming a woman is walking
upright), all the fluids and tissue from retrograde menstruation and anything
else (such as blood and infection from other organs) probably end up here.
And that makes the posterior cul-de-sac a prime location for endometrial
implants. Because the ovaries hang down into the cul-de-sac, everything in
the posterior cul-de-sac (including the end of the fallopian tubes, the back of
the uterus, and the intestines) can also have contact with the disease.
The posterior cul-de-sac is also a common site for deep endometriosis, where
the endometrial implants have grown through the peritoneum (covering) of
the structures (the ligaments, intestines, ovaries, tubes, and uterus) and
started to grow in the underlying, deeper tissues. The endometriosis can grow
into the ligaments and become inflammatory nodules (see Chapter 1) that
then irritate the intestines or the back of the uterus, causing all of them to
stick together. Endometriosis can also become nodules that stretch the tissue
or put pressure on nearby structures. The implants can even grow into the
vagina (remember, the top of the vagina is at the bottom of the cul-de-sac).
In the most severe case, this inflammation actually completely closes off the
cul-de-sac. That is, the whole space behind the uterus becomes one large
(and very painful) mess, with the intestines, ligaments, uterus, ovaries, and
tubes all stuck together in a frozen pelvis.
A less popular location: The anterior cul-de-sac
Endometriosis occurs less often in the anterior cul-de-sac than in the poste-
rior cul-de-sac (see the previous section). This fact makes sense because the
ends of the fallopian tubes are in the posterior cul-de-sac, so the regurgitated
endometrial tissue goes into the posterior cul-de-sac area most of the time.
(See “Endometriosis and your fallopian tubes” for more info on endometrial
tissue and fallopian tubes.) Only in abnormal cases are tubes in front of the
uterus in the anterior cul-de-sac.
But endometriosis in the anterior cul-de-sac isn’t rare, and although this area
has fewer organs, they can still stick together, just like structures in the pos-
terior cul-de-sac. The bladder is in the anterior cul-de-sac and is the most
common site for endometriosis in the anterior cul-de-sac. The bladder can
stick to the front of the uterus. If the adhesions are bad, the uterus may 
even stick to the anterior abdominal wall (the front surface of the peritoneal
cavity) compressing the bladder between these structures.
In very severe cases, the tubes, ovaries, and even the small intestine stick to
the front surface of the uterus, bladder, or abdominal wall. This result isn’t
common, but it can cause severe pain and bowel and bladder dysfunction.
Although much rarer than the posterior cul-de-sac’s frozen pelvis, the ante-
rior cul-de-sac may also be obliterated so that no space, only a mass of
tissue, remains.
52
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Endometriosis and your bladder
The bladder is the most common anterior cul-de-sac site for endometriosis,
and the condition can be painful. Because it’s constantly filling and emptying,
the bladder is stretching several times a day, which can cause pain in itself.
But the bladder is also a muscle, and inflamed muscles hurt when used —
just ask someone with a muscle strain!
In addition, because the bladder muscle isn’t very thick, the endometriosis
can work its way through the muscle and cause bleeding in the urine. In some
cases the bladder sticks to the front of the uterus or to the intestines.
Endometriosis in your bladder can cause
 Painful urination
 Bladder spasms
 Urinary urgency (when you “gotta go right now!”)
 Blood in the urine
We discuss endometriosis and your bladder more in Chapter 6.
Endometriosis and your intestines
Endometriosis is quite common in the intestines and in the appendix. In fact,
the intestines are the most common site for endometriosis outside of the
reproductive organs (which isn’t surprising because they’re in the neighbor-
hood). Endometriosis can appear in your intestines in several ways, including
scar tissue and invading the walls. Resulting symptoms may be
 Painful sex
 Right- or left-sided pain
 Generalized pelvic or abdominal pain
 Bloating and cramping after eating
 Blockages in the small intestine
 Bleeding with bowel movement
 Change in stool color or consistency
We talk about endometriosis and your intestines in detail in Chapter 6.
53
Chapter 3: Endometriosis: A Quick Review of Biology

Endometriosis and your cervix and vagina
Endometriosis of the cervix is quite rare. Why would endometriosis even
develop there, because menstrual flow normally passes through these
places? That question is the great mystery of endometriosis, but possible
causes are an altered immune response, metaplasia, or genetic defects of the
endometrium (see Chapter 4 for more info on the possible causes).
Two symptoms of endometriosis of the cervix are
 Pain during sex
 Irregular bleeding, especially after sex
The cervix is often contacted during sex, and endometriosis can make the
cervix tender to touch. As a result, women with endometriosis of the cervix
often have pain with deep penetration and then bleeding after, or even
during, sexual intercourse. These endometriosis lesions on the cervix can
also cause irregular spotting or heavy bleeding at any time during the cycle.
Even more unusual is endometriosis of the vagina, which occurs mostly in
the top third of the vagina. This occurrence may be due to the fact that sec-
tion of the vagina develops from the same embryologic tissues as the cervix
and uterus. The symptoms are the same as those of the cervix: pain with 
sex and irregular bleeding.

E
ndometriosis isn’t an unknown disease, but it’s still a mysterious one. The
tissue that behaves normally in the endometrium (the layer of tissue that
lines the uterus) causes all kinds of pain and dysfunction when it hits the road
and travels through the reproductive tract and beyond. One of the toughest
questions is: What sets the events into motion that move endometrium from
the endometrial cavity into other parts of the body to become endometriosis?
Researchers have been studying endometriosis, trying to answer this question.
This chapter looks at all the most common current theories as well as some
other theories that attempt to explain the development of endometriosis.
Speculating on How Endometriosis
Develops: The Most Common Theories
Several prevalent theories exist as to why endometriosis develops in some
women and not in others. Some days you may not really care how it got
there; you just want it to go away! But understanding how a disease works is
the first step to overcoming the problems it can bring. In this section, we
review the most common theories.

Migrating out the tubes: 
Retrograde menstruation
Every woman with a uterus has endometrial cells (cells that line the inside of
the uterus and support a pregnancy). Studies have shown that most, if not
all, women also have retrograde menstruation.
What exactly is retrograde menstruation? Most of the shed endometrial lining
during your period follows the route of gravity; it flows through the cervix,
into the vagina, and then out into the world for you to deal with (check out
Figure 4-1). The cramps you feel with your period are tiny contractions of the
uterine muscle as it tries to push the blood out. However, some menstrual
flow can take a wrong turn, so it ends up in the fallopian tubes and spills onto
the ovaries and into the peritoneum (the membrane lining of the abdominal
cavity). This process is called retrograde menstruation.
Retrograde menstruation is one of the oldest theories describing the possible
development of endometriosis. In the 1920s, Dr. John Sampson first identified
retrograde menstruation as a possible explanation for endometriosis. But this
theory can’t be the only explanation of how endometriosis develops, because
of these problems:
Normal menstrual outflow
Retrograde menstrual outflow
into the pelvic cavity.
Retrograde menstruation:
Endometrial tissue and menstrual blood
back up into fallopian tubes.

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 This theory doesn’t explain how endometriosis ends up in places far
from the pelvic cavity.
 This theory doesn’t explain why all women don’t have endometriosis,
because more than 90 percent have retrograde menstruation.
The following two sections look more closely at how a woman’s body, com-
bined with retrograde menstruation, can lead to endometriosis.
Pelvic abnormalities and endometriosis
Women with pelvic abnormalities (such as in Figure 4-2) are more prone to
endometriosis, mostly due to mechanical factors. This fact supports the ret-
rograde menstruation theory because these abnormalities lead to more back-
flow out the tubes.
The following are some of the more common abnormalities that may cause
endometriosis:
 Cervical stenosis: The cervix is more tightly closed than normal. This
condition can cause a greater degree of retrograde menstruation.
Because blood and debris can’t escape through the cervix as quickly
and easily as normal, it backs up so more of it flows backwards. Studies
show that around 80 percent of women with cervical stenosis develop
endometriosis.

Ovary

ities may

backflow.
57
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

 Longer menstrual periods with heavier than normal flow: These peri-
ods can increase the chance of endometriosis in the same way as cervi-
cal stenosis. Because more than 99 percent of all menstrual flow should
flow out of the vagina, only 1 percent normally goes backward, or in ret-
rograde direction. But, if your periods are closer together, heavier, or
longer lasting, you have more flow than normal. As a result, your 1 per-
cent retrograde flow is also more than normal.
 Uterine anomalies: These anomalies can be malformations of the shape
of the uterus and can also contribute to endometriosis. Approximately 
2 to 4 percent of all women have some sort of uterine anomaly. Uterine
anomalies that are congenital (present from birth) often arise from 
problems with the Mullerian ducts. (Check out the next section.)
Malformed Mullerian ducts
The top third of the vagina, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes develops from
two tubular structures in the fetus called the Mullerian ducts. Abnormalities
of this system can cause a higher risk of endometriosis. Mullerian ducts nor-
mally begin on the sides of the pelvic area and fuse in the middle, beginning
at the cervix. At the top of the new uterus, these ducts separate and form the
fallopian tubes that go out to the sides of the pelvis.
The most common Mullerian abnormality is a failed fusion somewhere along
the way. The most likely location for the problem is the top of the uterus,
where a partial separation of the body of the uterus can occur. In very rare
cases, a woman can have two of everything, including a cervix, a uterus, and
a tube on each side.
Blaming Mom: Is endometriosis 
hereditary?
Research shows that endometriosis has a family link because it tends to clus-
ter in families. If you have a first-degree relative (a mother or sister with
endometriosis), your risk of having endometriosis is seven to ten times
higher than your friend who has no endometriosis in her family. Not only are
you more likely to have endometriosis if it runs in your family, but your dis-
ease is also likely to be more severe than endometriosis found in women
without a family history of the disease. Aren’t genetics grand?
This section looks more closely at the possible connections between genetics
and endometriosis. This section also helps you check out your own family
tree to see whether endometriosis is prevalent.
58
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Understanding genetics
So why does endometriosis run in families? Today’s researchers seek
answers to this question. Great leaps in the study of molecular genetics (look-
ing at chromosomes and individual genes) have given researchers new
insight into the inheritance of the disease. As with many other diseases, such
as cystic fibrosis and diabetes, many subtle changes in the building blocks of
the chromosomes can have profound effects.
Researchers have observed and identified the following conditions in
endometriosis patients that strengthen the hereditary theory:
 Gene mutations: Some of these mutations affect the survival of detached
cells (cells that aren’t part of the basic structure of the endometrium
and that should die when removed, but don’t).
Scientists are finding significant evidence that the endometrial cells in
endometriosis have abnormal expression (how they work and perform)
of gene products that are responsible for survival, invasion, blood vessel
growth, and the like.
Endometrial cells from endometriosis implants show resistance to the
normal, programmed cell death (apoptosis) that’s found in these cells in
the uterus. This resistance, which may be genetic, can improve their sur-
vival and allow them to implant.
 Abnormal cell adhesion molecules: These abnormalities may allow
cells to grow on surfaces that don’t normally accept them. Other
enzymes help these cells invade and get a foothold where they don’t
belong. Progesterone usually suppresses these enzymes, but, for some
reason, women with endometriosis don’t have this suppressive process.
An inherited mutation may be the cause for this change.
Although estrogen is essential for endometrial growth, one enzyme, aro-
matase, converts other steroid hormones into estrogen. Normal endome-
trial tissue has no detectable aromatase, but endometriosis implants
contain this enzyme and show high levels of activity. A genetic abnor-
mality may allow this enzyme and its high activity to exist, leading to
high local levels of estrogen that may help the cells grow, invade, and
cause the disease.
Another enzyme, 17BHSD type 2, is found in normal endometrial tissue
and is activated by progesterone. This enzyme lowers estradiol (the
main estrogen produced by the ovary) levels. Because this enzyme isn’t
in endometriosis glands, higher levels of estradiol and subsequent
development of endometriosis can go unchecked.
These findings and additional research point to a genetic or inherited aspect
of the disease. Although science can’t cure bad genes, knowing the root
cause may lead to better treatments.
59
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

Carrying migrant endometrial cells from birth
One twist on the hereditary theory of endometriosis states that some women
have a hereditary tendency to produce cells predisposed to becoming
endometrial cells. This predisposition makes sense because a fetus begins
with one cell with the potential to become any and all cells in a human. These
stem cells (multipotential cells) can become any part of the body, so the cells
of the pelvic cavity (and other places) could possibly transform into endome-
trial cells and develop glands and stroma.
But does this only happen with endometrial cells? Does that mean an eyeball
could grow in the pelvis? These questions are difficult to answer, and the
answers may reside in the way the human body differentiates as it grows
from one cell to embryo to fetus to full-term baby. There are other disease
states where certain tissues develop in an unusual place (for example, der-
moid cysts may have skin, teeth, thyroid tissue, and hair).
These differentiating factors may mistakenly signal cells in the pelvis to
become endometrium. After all, this area is close to the uterus and normal
endometrium. Unfortunately this signal to an adjacent area doesn’t explain
the distant forms of endometriosis in the lungs, brain, and even umbilicus —
that’s a bit far out.
Other possible genetic misfires include
 Faulty cells that react to the local stimulus in the wrong way
 Incorrect signals that cause predisposed cells to become endometrium
rather than brain
The bottom line: Abnormalities exist and genetic predispositions to these
abnormalities are certainly possible.
Checking your family tree
Trying to figure out if your family has a history of endometriosis can be hard,
particularly if female family members have already gone through menopause.
They may not remember all their menstrual symptoms — they’re too busy
thinking about their current health issues to remember what happened 30
years ago. And many women grew up believing that menstrual pain was just
part of life, so they didn’t dwell on it.
Of course, anything to do with menstruation, pregnancy, or reproduction
wasn’t polite dinner conversation, so your questions may turn your mother
into a stone face who has no intentions of talking about such topics — 
especially not with you!
60
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Some inherited traits can definitely signal a tendency to develop endometrio-
sis, though, including your inherited body type. For example, you’re more
likely to have endometriosis if
 You’re tall and thin. Tall, thin women frequently have shorter menstrual
cycles, meaning that they bleed more frequently. They’re also more likely
to have cervical stenosis, another increased risk for endometriosis.
 You have red hair. Several studies have shown an association between
red hair and endometriosis, although a recent Harvard study showed
that only fertile women with red hair were more likely to have
endometriosis; infertile redheads weren’t.
 You have certain types of nevi, or moles. Several studies have shown
an association between dysplastic (abnormal or unusual) nevi and
endometriosis.
 You’re an identical twin, and your twin has endometriosis. An identi-
cal twin is more likely than a fraternal twin to have endometriosis if her
twin has it.
Exploring Other (Not-So-Common)
Theories
A number of theories related to who gets endometriosis and why have
popped up over the years; some are widely believed by laypersons even
though scientific studies have proven them to be incorrect. In the next sec-
tion, we sort out the fact from the fiction.
Using tampons
Many women use tampons during their periods for their convenience, but
some women fear that convenience comes at a price — a higher risk of devel-
oping endometriosis. Does research support the theory that using tampons
increases your chance of developing endometriosis? We take a look at the
controversy of tampon use in endometriosis in the next sections.
Do tampons cause or protect against endometriosis?
For many years, some experts have been convinced that using tampons
during your menstrual flow can increase your chance of developing
endometriosis. Some of the factors contributing to this belief were
61
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

 The possibility that tampons increased retrograde menstruation
 The possibility that tampons still contain small amounts of dioxin, a
chemical toxin in tampons until the late 1980s (see the nearby sidebar,
“Understanding dioxin exposure”)
Most tampons consist of rayon, a highly absorbent material. Because the
rayon is bleached with chlorine for a white appearance, some people believe
the process leaves small amounts of dioxin in tampons. Tampon makers have
denied any significant amount of dioxin present in tampons, certainly not
enough to cause any harmful effects.
However, a recent study of more than 2,000 women concluded that women
who use tampons may actually have lower rates of endometriosis than
women who use only pads during their periods. Note: This study may not
have considered the many women with endometriosis who don’t use tam-
pons because the insertion is too painful. In any event, this study showed no
evidence that tampon use increases your risk of endometriosis.
The most publicized study that showed a link between endometriosis and
dioxin involved 24 rhesus monkeys in the 1970s. Although the focus of the
study was the effect of dioxin on the monkeys’ fertility, additional results
showed
 Endometriosis does develop spontaneously in rhesus monkeys.
 One-third of the control group (who didn’t receive dioxin) developed the
disease.
 The two groups who received dioxin had a 71 percent and 86 percent
rate of endometriosis.
 The higher-dosage group had the higher percentage of the disease.
The tampon battle wages on
Because of the controversy over this topic, The Tampon Safety and Research
Act of 1997 was introduced to the United States Congress. This bill asks for
research on the risks of dioxin, synthetic fibers, and other additives in tam-
pons and similar products. Unfortunately, as of this writing, this bill is still sit-
ting in Congress.
Dioxin-free tampons with natural, unbleached, chlorine-free cotton are avail-
able. Some brands include Natracare and Terra Femme. A silk reusable
tampon is also available. You can purchase these products from the following
sources, among others:

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Having a tubal ligation
Studies show that some women may develop endometriosis after having a
tubal ligation (having your tubes tied to prevent pregnancy). But, you ask, if
the retrograde menstruation theory is correct (refer to the section, “Migrating
out the tubes: Retrograde menstruation,” earlier in this chapter), how can
blood back up through the top of blocked tubes?
One possibility is that some small, unseen islands of endometrial tissue were
present before the surgery. These microscopic implants can then eventually
grow, cause symptoms, and become endometriosis.
No matter what process causes the problem after tubal ligation, studies don’t
show that the surgery is actually responsible for the disease. In fact, studies
haven’t ever shown a relationship between a tubal ligation and increased risk
of endometriosis.
Women who opt for this procedure have most likely had children. In reality,
these women may very well have had endometriosis all their lives, but the
pregnancy(s) kept it at bay (see the section “Does pregnancy help prevent
endometriosis?” later in this chapter) masking the signs and symptoms.
These symptoms appear then, only after long, pregnancy-free periods of time.
63
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis
Understanding dioxin exposure
Dioxins are chemical-compound byproducts
from burning fuels (such as wood, coal, and oil)
or from waste incineration. Dioxins can form
from the bleaching of pulp and paper during
paper manufacturing and from other types of
chemical manufacturing. Small amounts of
dioxins are in cigarette smoke, and they occur
naturally in forest fires.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stan-
dards have become much more rigid in the past
few decades and dioxin levels have been
decreasing. Industrial levels of dioxins are 90
percent lower than 20 years ago. But because
dioxins break down very slowly, today’s dioxin
exposure can come from compounds released
many years ago. For example, dioxins produced
years ago can still be polluting the soil today.
Today, considerable controversy continues over
whether or not tampon use exposes women to
dioxin.
Dioxins deposited on plants become part of the
food chain, and animal fat has a high concen-
tration of dioxins. In fact, although you can
absorb small amounts of dioxin from the air, soil,
and water, most dioxin exposure (more than 95
percent) comes from eating animal fats. You can
reduce your dioxin exposure by eating lean
meat and reducing your intake of saturated fats.
Testing for dioxin levels isn’t routinely available,
because the tests are very expensive and
results are difficult to interpret.

Scientists can find no logical reason for tubal ligation, a minor procedure, to
cause endometriosis. Note: Historically, people have blamed this surgery for
many other problems (irregular and heavy periods, pelvic congestion syn-
drome, and so on). But none of these connections has ever panned out either.
Most women who undergo this surgery are in their late 30s to early 40s, an
age group where these problems naturally increase.
If surgeries could increase the risk of endometriosis, then many other gyneco-
logic procedures (hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingogram [HSG], saline infusion
sonohysterogram [SIS], and the like — check out Chapter 9 for more info on
these procedures) would have a more profound effect than tubal ligations
because these other procedures can actually force cells out the tube and into
the pelvis. But these procedures don’t cause endometriosis either.
Answering some of the unanswered 
questions: The metaplasia theory
Most theories on endometriosis can’t answer some nagging questions. For
example, why is endometriosis in girls who haven’t gone through puberty
yet, and also (though rarely) in men? And why does the tissue in endometrio-
sis not exactly resemble that of the endometrium? These questions have led
to other theories, the current leading one being the metaplasia theory.
Metaplasia is the changing of a certain type of cell into a different type of cell.
Recent research on tissue-typing and molecular studies suggests this theory
over retrograde menstruation for the following reasons:
 The peritoneal cavity, Mullerian system, and pleura (lung tissue in gen-
eral) all develop from the same embryologic layer of tissue, the mesothe-
lium. (Check out Chapter 3 for peritoneal cavity and pleura info and the
section “Malformed Mullerian ducts” earlier in this chapter.)
 Ovarian surface cells and stromal cells grow glands and stroma when
cultured with estrogen.
 Endometrial tissue from the uterus is functionally different and looks 
different under the microscope from endometriosis tissue.
 Girls who haven’t reached puberty, women with few and light periods,
women with tied tubes, and even men can all have endometriosis, even
though none of them can have retrograde menstruation.
The metaplasia theory suggests that when the mesodermal cells in the pelvis,
abdomen, and lungs are exposed to some stimulus from the menstrual flow or
an outside source, the cells morph (change) into endometrial cells. Back in
the 1950s, Dr. John Sampson, the first proponent of the retrograde menstrua-
tion theory, noted that endometriosis may be “due to a specific irritant.”
64
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Understanding your immune system’s 
role in endometriosis
Most women have the components (such as retrograde menstruation) that
would make endometriosis development possible. So why does only a small
percentage of women ever develop endometriosis? Why do the endometrial
cells take root and grow in some women and not in others?
The answer may lie in the immune system. The study of the immune system
and its relation to endometriosis and other immune-related diseases (such as
lupus, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome) has rapidly progressed in
the last decade. The immune system does seem to play a role in endometriosis.
New research sheds more and more light onto the inner workings of the
immune system, but at the same time that research makes the waters murky.
Endometriosis isn’t immune (forgive the play on words) to this confusion. In
the next sections, we highlight and try to simplify the immune system’s
involvement in endometriosis.
Meeting the immune cells
Normally your immune system gets rid of bad tissue and debris from injury
or other problems. However, that process doesn’t seem to work normally in
women who develop endometriosis. The main question is, “Why does the
body tolerate endometrial cells that develop in the wrong place or why do
lymph nodes or blood vessels deposit them in strange areas of the body?”
65
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis
Asthma, allergies, and autoimmune 
issues in endometriosis
There’s growing evidence that endometriosis is
an autoimmune disease. There’s also growing
evidence that people who have one autoim-
mune disease are more likely to have additional
autoimmune problems. One large study of more
than 3,000 women with endometriosis showed
the following:
 Sixty-one percent had allergies compared
to 18 percent of the U.S. general population.
 Twelve percent had asthma compared to 5
percent of the general population.
 Chronic fatigue syndrome was more than a
hundred times more common than in the
female U.S. population overall.
 Hypothyroidism was seven times more
common.
 Fibromyalgia was twice as common.

In order to get a basic understanding of how your immune system affects
endometriosis, you first need to understand the different types of immune
cells. In this section, we introduce these cells and describe their different
functions. Don’t worry if you can’t remember all the names — or pronounce
them — there won’t be a test on this!
Marauding macrophages
Macrophages, a type of white blood cell, are the body’s scavenger cells. They
aren’t activated by antigens (foreign substances in the body that stimulate
antibodies) and they don’t rely on memory (like vaccines). These cells 
work by recognizing intruders and then eating or swallowing them (called
phagocytosis). In this way they scavenge the body and rid it of dead cells, 
cellular debris, and some invading pathogens.
Macrophages secrete many proteins that help them do their job. The pro-
teins include the following:
 Cytokines: They act as chemical messengers between cells, and can
stimulate or inhibit the growth and activity of various immune cells.
 Growth factors: Proteins that stimulate cell growth.
 Enzymes: Enzymes trigger specific activity in cells.
 Prostaglandins: Hormonelike chemicals that, when released in the
uterus, cause cramping.
Macrophages are normally in peritoneal fluid, but their numbers are higher in
women with endometriosis. In addition, their secretions seem to promote the
disease instead of scavenging the wayward endometrial cells.
Dodging Natural Killer (NK) cells
Natural Killer (NK) cells are another kind of white blood cell in the immune
system. These cells attack cells that have antibodies stuck on them.
These NK cells also have receptors on their surface that regulate their activ-
ity by either killer-activating or killer-inhibiting the cells. The numbers of 
NK cells in the peritoneal fluid varies, but women with endometriosis have
less cell-killing activity. The reason for this decrease seems to be that their
NK cells have many more killer-inhibitory receptors than normal.
Looking at lymphocytes
Another group of immune cells are lymphocytes, another type of white blood
cell. These cells
66
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 Mature in the bone marrow and then enter the blood stream
 Are more prevalent in the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis victims
 Come in two basic flavors:
• B lymphocytes: Secrete immunoglobulins that are specific for cer-
tain microorganisms (this is how your body fights colds and other
diseases).
• T lymphocytes: Help the B-cells make antibodies. They can also
activate macrophages, get rid of intra-cellular (those within the cell
itself) microbes, and kill cancer cells.
Dealing with immune cell secretions
Lymphocytes, monocytes (another type of white blood cell), macrophages,
and other cells, including the endometrial cells themselves, secrete proteins
that can have profound effects on the body. These proteins serve as messen-
gers for
 Chemotaxis (cell movement due to chemical attraction)
 Mitosis (cell division)
 Differentiation (the reason everyone has different kinds of cells)
 Formation (of new blood vessels)
The following proteins are important (but not the only ones) in endometriosis:
 Interleukin-1 (I-1) can enhance the development of endometriosis by
causing the release of factors for blood vessel growth and a molecule
from the endometrial cells that hide endometrial cells from the immune
system so they’re not destroyed.
 Interleukin-8 is released under the influence of I-1. This is a powerful stim-
ulus of new vessel growth that also increases the ability of the endome-
trial stromal cells to adhere where they land. The number of these
interleukins is higher in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis,
and the amount correlates with the severity of the disease.
 Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and RANTES (you don’t want to 
know what it stands for!) help macrophages get to the peritoneal 
cavity. I-1 and estrogen promote the production of these cells and help
endometriosis to develop. Their numbers are higher in endometriosis.
 Tumor necrosis factor – Alpha (TNF-a) may help endometrial cells
adhere to a cellular matrix and promote attachment of these cells and
formation of endometriosis. I-1 increases its production. The number of
TNF-a is higher in women with endometriosis.
67
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF for short) helps the
endometrial cells establish new blood vessels to promote development
of endometriosis. Early endometriosis lesions have high levels of VEGF,
and powder burn lesions (older, burned out disease) have lower levels.
This difference in levels makes sense because the early lesions are most
active metabolically.
All these factors (the immune cells and their secretions, the proteins pro-
duced from the lining of the pelvis and the endometrial cells, and so forth)
can have a profound effect on the development of endometriosis. In theory,
women with endometriosis have an abnormality that allows endometrial cells
to survive outside the endometrium, stick to surfaces where it shouldn’t be
found, grow, and cause damage. But, does the immune system have an inher-
ent defect or do the endometrial cells of these women cause the immune
system to respond abnormally? This is the question for future research.
Exploring the autoimmune connection
As the previous section explains, the immune system is very complex —
errors can occur. One error is when the body fails to recognize itself so it
attacks its own proteins as if they were the invaders. This is called an autoim-
mune disease, and some evidence shows that endometriosis may be an
autoimmune disease.
Autoimmune diseases have the following characteristics:
 Hormonal element: Because autoimmune diseases are more common in
women than in men, a hormonal component is likely.
 Numbers of autoimmune diseases: Autoimmune diseases also like to
travel together; after a patient has one, she’s more likely to develop
other autoimmune disorders. A study from the recent World Congress
on Endometriosis showed 12 percent had an autoimmune disease (even
though only about 2 percent of all women have such problems).
Consider the following statistics from another study on women with
endometriosis:
• Almost 30 percent have fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome
• More than 10 percent have asthma
• More than 60 percent have allergies
This study concluded that these numbers suggest an association
between endometriosis and autoimmune diseases.
68
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 Genetics: Although an identical twin has a 30 percent chance of having a
disorder if her twin has one, nonidentical twins or other siblings have
less than a 3 percent risk of having the same disorder. Even if genetics
don’t exactly cause the problem, bad genes may make you more suscep-
tible to irritants and stimulants.
 Immune system abnormalities: These abnormalities are consistent with
the findings in autoimmune diseases. The same culprits — macrophages,
lymphocytes, NK cells, cytokines, and other substances they produce —
are all in both endometriosis and autoimmune disorders. (See the previ-
ous part of this section for a discussion of these conditions.)
These similarities and the association of these diseases with each other
strongly suggest that endometriosis has an autoimmune component.
Researchers haven’t been able to prove it, but research continues to support
this relationship.
Relating allergies to endometriosis
As the previous section notes, women with endometriosis also seem to have
a higher rate of allergies than other women. (Check out the nearby sidebar,
“Asthma, allergies, and autoimmune issues in endometriosis,” for some inter-
esting related statistics.) This connection makes sense because of the likely
immune system component in endometriosis. Allergies are another example
of an altered, or abnormal, immune response.
What happens during an allergic reaction and what is its relationship to
endometriosis? In allergies and asthma, just like endometriosis, the immune
system either over-responds or abnormally reacts to normal proteins or
minor exposure to harmless antigens causing damage to the body. The fol-
lowing shows how your immune system responds during an allergic reaction:
1. The immune system protects the body when the body is exposed to
foreign material, such as allergens (tissue, debris, germs, pollen, and
so on).
2. B and T lymphocytes work together to form antibodies that attack the
allergens, which the B and T lymphocytes see as a threat.
(See “Looking at lymphocytes” earlier in this section.)
3. When exposed to this threat, T lymphocytes release cytokines that
stimulate the B lymphocytes to multiply and make the specific anti-
body.
4. This antibody attaches to the antigen (and to the foreign material),
and prepares to remove it from the body.
The T suppressor cells help regulate the response and help turn the
response off when the job is done.
69
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

5. This immune response causes inflammation in the area because blood
flow increases and blood vessels become more permeable.
In addition to the redness, warmth, and swelling in the area, the
cytokines and pressure on the nerve endings in the tissue cause pain.
Check out the sidebar, “Gesundheit and g’night: The multiple responses
to allergies,” for more symptoms of allergies.
If allergies and the body’s response to them sounds just like the immune
system and endometriosis, you’re right! In both cases the immune system is
responding to seemingly harmless foreign matter (endometrial cells or irri-
tants such as pollen) in a way that wreaks havoc on the body. The associa-
tion is strong: Many women with endometriosis also have multiple allergies,
and both conditions run in families, indicating a genetic predisposition.
Recurring yeast infections and endometriosis
A fungus called candida albicans causes yeast infections in the mucus mem-
branes, mouth, throat, intestines and genito-urinary tracts. A very common
form of candida disease, vaginal yeast infection, may drive you to distraction
by the itching and cheesy white coating it produces. Although this vaginal
yeast is common and annoying, most healthcare providers don’t consider it
serious.
Candida’s primary purpose is to destroy harmful bacteria in the intestines.
Under normal circumstances, the following conditions control candida’s
growth:
 Good bacteria
 The body’s pH balance (acidity and alkalinity); candida doesn’t like acid
 A healthy immune system
70
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 
Gesundheit and g’night: The multiple 
responses to allergies
Some cells in the immune system cause the
release of histamines, chemicals that cause the
sneezing, runny nose, hives, itching, fatigue,
and other symptoms of allergies. Histamines
can also cause constriction of the bronchials
(tubes that feed air into the lungs) that lead to
the wheezing in asthma. In severe reactions,
this tightening of the breathing tubes can be
life-threatening.
Fatigue (chronic tiredness and loss of energy)
is one of the most common signs of histamine
release — and all immune diseases and abnor-
mal inflammatory responses, for that matter. In
fact, fatigue is the most common symptom of
immune processes and can be debilitating.

So what causes a vaginal or vulvar yeast infection and how does it relate to
endometriosis? The following are the main culprits:
 Irritated skin: This irritation can be from moisture (wet bathing suit),
sprays, perfumes, laundry-detergent residue, douching, exposure to
chemicals (such as chlorine), and even semen. These irritations to the
vagina may alter the critical pH balance of the area. When imbalances
occur, disease can follow.
 Antibiotics: Antibiotics kill off the lactobacillus (good bacteria that make
lactic acid and lower the pH of the vagina). Other substances, such as
douches, perfumed soaps, and feminine hygiene products, can also
directly affect the pH of the vulva and vagina, making the pH less acidic
and allowing the yeast to flourish. The yeast can
• Cause an inflammatory response
• Directly break down the protective barriers that the skin and
mucous membranes of the body use.
Once these barriers have been breached, candida can enter the
body and cause infection and other problems.
 Environmental toxins: Dioxin, PCBs, and the usual suspects, such as too
much alcohol, overindulgence in simple sugars, and cigarette smoke,
compromise the skin and mucus barriers, possibly allowing the yeast to
penetrate the barrier in the intestine. Because hormonal changes may
contribute to this breakdown, chemicals may play another role: convert-
ing intestinal substances into hormone-like chemicals.
 Allergic reaction to candida: Some women may be allergic to candida,
so even the normal amount of yeast can be problematic. This fact may
explain why endometriosis sufferers (who are more prone to allergies in
the first place) tend to be more susceptible to yeast infections. Another
possibility is that a woman’s intolerance to candida makes her more
likely to develop endometriosis. The immune system abnormalities asso-
ciated with candida, along with the chromic inflammatory response to
the infection, can also encourage the growth of endometriosis.
The possible relationship between candida and endometriosis is 
complicated — and very controversial. Candida and its relation to immune
system malfunctions need more research. If you have recurrent yeast infec-
tions and you have endometriosis, consider treatment for candida in addition
to medical therapy for endometriosis. Some case reports have suggested that
lowering candida albicans levels as much as possible may minimize autoim-
mune problems, including endometriosis.

Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

The Mystery of Traveling Endometriosis
You suspect you have endometriosis, or your doctor may have diagnosed
you with the disease. However, you’re wondering how the endometriosis you
have in your pelvic area can end up in your lungs or even your brain. It didn’t
catch the red-eye from your uterus to your lungs, so how does endometriosis
travel to different areas in your body from the pelvic area?
Animal studies show that when scientists place endometrial tissue into an
animal’s pelvic cavity, the tissue eventually resembles endometriosis. (The
only animals that spontaneously develop endometriosis are rhesus monkeys,
as far as we know.) Yet, unlike in humans, this artificially induced disease in
the studies doesn’t seem to travel anywhere.
In this section, we discuss the ways endometriosis may hitch a ride to far-off
parts of the body.
Hitching a ride in the lymphatic and 
vascular systems
One explanation for endometriosis ending up out of the pelvis is the lym-
phatic and vascular spread theory. In cancer, malignant cells travel through-
out the body via two routes — the lymphatic system or the blood. Both of
these methods require the malignant cells to lose their attachment to other
cells nearby and still survive. This is one of the mysteries of malignancy. But
don’t worry, endometriosis isn’t cancer.
The lymphatic system is a collection of small channels that roughly parallel
the vascular (blood vessel) system (check out Figure 4-3). Its job description
includes removal of cells, debris, and excess fluid from the tissues, so the
lymph system sort of acts as a filter, where the white blood cells clean up the
body. You may have had infections where your lymph nodes were enlarged
and tender. This symptom is an indication that the lymph system is working.
Uterine contractions quite possibly force endometrial cells into the lymph
channels and blood vessels that are in and around the uterus and then ship
the cells up into the pelvis or other, far off places, such as the lungs or brain.
This theory makes some sense because the uterus is rich in lymph and blood
vessels.
72
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

But does the forced delivery really occur? Scientists have seen apparent
endometrial cells microscopically in the lymphatic system of the uterus, but
this doesn’t mean the cells are viable and able to implant elsewhere. And this
theory presents another question: How do the cells get out of the lymph
channels? Though this is an attractive theory to explain the rare incidence of
distant endometriosis, it remains unproven.
Although the lymphatic and vascular systems theory has some support, the
vast majority of scientists and physicians believe this method may be sec-
ondary to other theories (see Figure 4-4). Time and research may shed light
on the real cause in the near future. Endometriosis may be not one disease
but several.
Spreading endometriosis through surgery
Another way endometriosis may get to distant places is through surgery. The
following scenario may happen during a hysteroscopy (see Chapter 11 for
more on a hysteroscopy):
Red bone marrow
Palatine tonsil
Spleen
Peyers patches of small intestine
Inguinal lymph node
Intestinal lymph node
Large intestine
Thoracic duct
Axillary lymph node
Thymus gland
Cervical lymph nodes

Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

1. The surgeon forces fluid or air under high pressure into the uterine
cavity.
2. The procedure forces endometrial tissue out of the tubes and possibly
into lymph or blood vessels.
3. The endometrial cells may
• Remain in the pelvis (because this is where they first wind up)
• Go anywhere, even to distant organs after they’ve entered the
extensive lymph and blood systems
Endometrial cells can be dragged during surgery from the endometrial cavity
or endometriosis implants in the pelvis to other areas. Two examples of this
occurrence are
 During a cesarean section, the endometrial cavity is open and cells can
spill out or be pulled out with the baby or placenta (afterbirth).
 While removing endometriosis from the pelvis, the surgeon may inadver-
tently plant endometrial cells into the wound opening or other parts of
the abdomen.
Scientists have documented this surgical spread by observing
endometriosis in old scars and other areas from previous surgery.

Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

Avoiding Endometriosis: Is It Possible?
If you know you have a family history of endometriosis but don’t have any
symptoms, is there a way to keep it from rearing its ugly head? Maybe, maybe
not, but trying to avoid endometriosis can’t hurt. This section looks at a couple
of known risk factors for endometriosis and explains how avoiding them may
decrease your chance of activating the disease or lessen its severity.
Does pregnancy help prevent 
endometriosis?
Evidence suggests that having children at a young age (when you’re young,
that is — all children are young!) can decrease your chance of having
endometriosis. Likewise, most experts agree that being nulliparous — a fancy
way of saying you’ve never been pregnant — increases your chance of devel-
oping endometriosis. These observations support another observable trend:
Women who wait to get pregnant also tend to have a higher incidence of
endometriosis.
But what causes this trend? Consider the following elements of the leading
theories on endometriosis:
 The disease often occurs in women with regular, and sometimes more
frequent and heavier, menstrual cycles.
 Women with years and years of uninterrupted, regular menstrual peri-
ods have much more time for regurgitation of endometrium and debris
out the tubes.
 The endometrium and debris either implant on the structures of the
pelvic cavity (the retrograde theory) or irritate the peritoneum to
change into endometriosis (metaplasia theory).
When pregnancy stops your menstrual cycle, it also
 Stops the possible retrograde menstruation of endometrial tissue into
the pelvic area
 Reduces your lifetime exposure to menstrual bleeding
 Raises levels of progesterone in your blood
These higher progesterone levels further suppress the endometrium by
preventing mitosis (cell division) and growth of the tissue. Without this
tissue growth, endometriosis can’t progress and worsen.
75
Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis

The lack of menstrual periods and suppression of the endometrial tissue can
also minimize the symptoms of endometriosis for a long time because
 Decreased hormonal activity (over the nine months of pregnancy and
several weeks to months after birth) can’t stimulate endometrial
implants.
 The direct effects of progesterone and the pregnancy hormones can sup-
press the implants.
This combination of no stimulation with increased suppression can burn out
the endometrial implants, giving a woman long, symptom-free periods of time.
So, you may ask in an irrational moment, if pregnancy is so effective, why
doesn’t everyone use this method? Kids are cute and this can cure
endometriosis — just stay pregnant until menopause! Ah, yes, unfortunately
this logic has its problems (but you knew that!):
 Most women don’t want to be pregnant for 10 to 30 years.
 This really isn’t a healthy way to go. (Yes, pregnancy is normal and nat-
ural, but it’s still much more risky to your health than the nonpregnant
state).
 The Catch-22: Women with endometriosis often are infertile, so they
can’t get pregnant.
But if the timing in a woman’s life is correct, if she can get pregnant (with or
without help), and if she doesn’t mind having a few kids, pregnancy may be
an alternative to other treatments (but not exactly a cheaper one).
Watching what you eat
Good nutrition is important, no matter how healthy you are. However, it’s
especially important if you’re trying to keep your immune system and other
body systems in tip-top condition to fight off the effects of a chronic disease
like endometriosis.
Can you eat away endometriosis? Probably not. Can you eat in a way that
minimizes endometriosis symptoms and strengthens your immune system?
Probably.
Recent studies show that
 Eating more fresh fruits and green vegetables and limiting red meat and
ham may reduce your chance of developing endometriosis.
 People with diets high in polyunsaturated fats have a greater chance for
developing endometriosis.
76
Part I: Endometriosis: What It Is and Isn’t 

 Certain types of fatty acids can increase prostaglandin levels and add to
the symptoms of the disease.
 Simple sugars that increase insulin levels may also cause a rise in
prostaglandins, increasing the symptoms of endometriosis.
 Caffeine can stimulate cramps and contractions of intestinal and uterine
muscle (common symptoms of endometriosis).
We cover these precautions in more detail in Chapter 16.
What you eat may be important, but equally important may be how much you
eat. Studies on the effect of body mass index, or BMI, are inconclusive (check
out Table 4-1 for a detailed chart of BMI), but a recent study showed a possi-
ble link between low body mass index in tall women and endometriosis.
According to the study, women with endometriosis had an average BMI of
21.3 compared to an average BMI of 23.2 in a control group of women without
endometriosis.
Considering environmental factors
Undoubtedly, pollution is bad for you in a number of ways. Humans produce
tens of thousands of chemicals (mostly through manufacturing) that we then
dump into the environment as waste or trash. Over the years, nature breaks
the chemicals down, and the environment absorbs and accumulates them. In
the meantime, your food (plants and animals) and water store these chemi-
cals, and you take them in when you eat.
Endometriosis is related to environmental contamination. Dioxin, one of the first
pollutants scientists studied, is an example (see the sidebar “Understanding
dioxin exposure” earlier in this chapter) of an environmental effect on
endometriosis. Likewise, scientists can link pollutants to multiple sclerosis,
lupus, thyroid disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and even
cancer.
One of the big problems with chemicals dumped into the environment is
their unknown effects on people. Researchers haven’t tested many of these
pollutants on humans, and, as a result, can’t know safe levels of use. Also,
valid studies and data don’t exist regarding chemical interactions. For exam-
ple, two or more harmless chemicals may combine to make a potentially
lethal substance.
Be aware of your environment and avoid the obvious toxins, such as dioxin
and PVCs; use the safest products and eat the healthiest foods you can. 
In this way you can minimize your risks of endometriosis and other 
environmentally-linked diseases (and you can feel better at the same time).
See Chapter 16 for specific ways to decrease your exposure to chemicals in
your environment.

Chapter 4: Determining What Causes Endometriosis
Are endometriosis and cancer related?
Having endometriosis is bad enough, but the
thought that endometriosis may increase your
risk of developing certain types of cancer is
even worse. Even though studies are inconclu-
sive about a definite link between certain can-
cers and endometriosis, research indicates 
that endometriosis doesn’t increase the general
risk of cancer. However, endometriosis may
increase the risk of certain rare cancers.
According to a very large (64,000 women) retro-
spective study (researchers looked at statistics
only after the study was complete) in Sweden,
the cancers that are more prevalent in women
with endometriosis are
 Ovarian cancer
 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
 Certain endocrine cancers
 Certain brain cancers
Other significant and interesting conclusions
from this study are
 Women who had endometriosis and a hys-
terectomy showed no increase in ovarian
cancer over the general population.
 Younger women who developed endometrio-
sis between the ages of 20 and 40 had a
higher risk of getting ovarian cancer than
other age groups.
 Women with endometriosis developed
cancer at a younger age than the general
population.
 Women with endometriosis had a lower 
risk of cervical cancer than the general
population.
The reason for this conclusion isn’t clear,
but a common symptom may play a role. You
guessed it — painful sex! (Check out
Chapter 2 for more information on this and
other symptoms of endometriosis.) When
you consider that cervical cancer rates are
higher in women with more active sex lives
(and number of partners), the symptoms of
endometriosis can decrease this activity
and, as a result, lower the cervical cancer
rates in women with these symptoms. (This
is just an unproven theory, so don’t use it as
an excuse for avoiding sex!)
Can endometriosis ever turn into cancer? Yes
and no. Endometriosis isn’t a cancer itself; it’s
only endometrial tissue. Note: Cancer that
develops in the endometrial lining of the uterus
is, oddly enough, endometrial cancer. However,
this disease mainly affects postmenopausal
women, the one age group that endometriosis
seldom strikes!
Endometrial cancer can develop in younger
women, but rarely does. These women almost
always have polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS) or very infrequent periods. In other
words, these women have no regular menses
and, logically, no symptoms of endometriosis.
One rare form of endometrial cancer (clear cell
carcinoma) does occur in the implants of
endometriosis. As with any other abnormality,
you should have a biopsy on any suspicious
area.
Dr. K., who has been active in gynecology at
major teaching and referral hospitals for 30
years, has seen only one case of cancer in
endometriosis in his career. Because the
chances of your having this disease are
extremely rare, Dr. K. doesn’t recommend
surgery to explore the possibility.

 Figuring out the connection: Your menstrual cycle and endometriosis
 Taking a closer look at the painful side of cycles
 Making dysfunctional periods functional
 Adjusting abnormal bleeding through surgery
 Bidding a not-so-fond farewell to endometriosis: Menopause
Your menstrual cycle is complex. Hormones and complicated feedback
systems orchestrate your reproductive system’s march each month
toward a single goal — the production of a healthy egg that can grow in a
properly prepared uterine cavity. In other words, all your body cares about
each month is making sure you can get pregnant.
Endometriosis can disrupt the normal march of your menstrual cycle by
interfering with your hormones, your egg’s production and release, the fertil-
ization of the egg, and the egg’s ability to travel to the uterus. In addition,
endometriosis can cause pain throughout your menstrual cycle, especially
around your period.
This chapter looks more closely at your menstrual cycle and the ways
endometriosis can mess it up. We uncover the relationship between your
period and endometriosis by first looking at a normal period and then com-
paring it to a period with endometriosis.
We also tell you how to know whether your pain is endometriosis or another
gynecologic problem. Next we discuss medical and surgical treatments to reg-
ulate your menstrual cycle and decrease pain and irregular bleeding. Finally,
we take a brief look at menopause and its effect on endometriosis

Your Period and Endometriosis: 
Why Are They Connected?
Fact: Endometriosis and your menstrual cycle are closely related. Because
endometriosis derives from endometrial tissue, it functions in much the same
way; it grows like your uterine lining does during the first part of your men-
strual cycle and bleeds when your uterine endometrial lining sheds during
your period. For this reason, many women experience more pain from
endometriosis around the time of menses than any other time. (See Chapter 3
for more background on endometrial tissue.)
To understand the symptoms of endometriosis, you need to first understand
the inner workings of the menstrual system. In the next sections, we tell you
how your menstrual system works when it’s in perfect order and then give
you the lowdown on how endometriosis can throw your menstrual cycle out
of synch.
Looking at a healthy cycle
A normal menstrual cycle is like a complex work of art (check out Figure 5-1).
Okay, you may not think that when you’re changing pads or dealing with
cramps, but your reproductive system really is amazing. And yet many
women understand little of the menstrual cycle. When you understand all the
intricate workings, you have a much better grasp of how endometriosis can
gum up the works, so to speak.
What exactly is the menstrual cycle anyway? Is it just the time you’re actively
bleeding, or is it the time between bleeds, too? When your doctor starts
asking questions about your cycle, you may not be sure exactly what he’s
asking. Our goal is to translate that jargon into regular talk for you.
How long is the cycle?
When your doctor asks you how long your cycles are, he wants to know the
number of days between Day 1 of one period and Day 1 of the next. Menstrual
cycles are traditionally 28 days. However, only one in ten women actually
experience regular 28-day cycles. Cycles are usually 21 to 35 days apart.
Day 1 of your period is the first day of full flow. If you spot on and off for a few
days before breaking out the pads and tampons, you haven’t started your
new cycle yet. Even when you start a full flow period just before bedtime, it’s
still Day 1 of your new cycle.
84
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

The most consistent element of the menstrual cycle is that periods start 13 to
14 days after ovulation. (Check out Chapter 7 for more about ovulation.) If
you ovulate early (before day 14), your cycles are shorter than normal. If 
you ovulate later than 14 days into your cycle, your cycles are longer than 
28 days.
When your doctor asks how long your period lasts, he wants to know how
many days your bleeding lasts. Menstrual flow normally lasts two to seven
days, with an average of four days.
How do hormones orchestrate your cycle?
So what regulates all this flow? The answer is hormones. When you’re feeling
out of sorts and irritable, you may say you’re feeling hormonal, but the truth
is that you’re hormonal all the time. Estrogen goes up, follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) goes down . . . your body constantly has something happen-
ing hormonally. The three hormone-control systems that work together to
manage your cycle are
Uterus
Ovary
Fallopian tube
Egg
Vagina
Endometrium

Chapter 5: Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle 

 The hypothalamus (the small structure in the middle of the brain that
regulates the nervous and endocrine systems)
 The pituitary (an endocrine gland at the base of the brain below the
hypothalamus that secretes several hormones)
 The ovary (the female reproductive organ that produces estrogen, prog-
esterone, and eggs)
Right before your period starts, your hormone levels drop to their lowest
levels. At this moment, the cycle starts again. (Check out Figure 5-2.)
What are the steps in a normal cycle?
The following list describes the menstrual cycle:
1. The hypothalamus, the master gland, produces a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH).
This production tells the pituitary gland to start making follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH).
2. FSH travels through the bloodstream to the ovaries.

Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

3. Anywhere from 1 to 15 eggs containing follicles start to grow in the
ovary.
One egg — sometimes two — grows faster than the others and becomes
the dominant follicle or follicles. The rest stop growing and fade away,
never to be seen again.
4. FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen, one of the main
female hormones.
Estrogen helps the eggs mature and starts to thicken the uterine
endometrial lining, which is very thin right after your period.
5. As estrogen rises, FSH is suppressed and then rises again in conjunc-
tion with the release of a luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary
gland.
This process occurs mid-cycle as the egg nears maturity.
6. LH causes the dominant follicle to enlarge and the egg to fully mature,
weakening the follicle wall.
This causes the egg to burst out of its follicle in the process called 
ovulation.
7. The follicle that was home to the released eggs collapses.
Under the influence of the pituitary hormone LH, the collapsed follicle
becomes the corpus luteum that produces progesterone. This proges-
terone then changes the composition of your endometrial lining, making
it denser and more receptive to a potential embryo. Your basal body
temperature rises one half to one degree when your progesterone rises.
8. The pituitary gland stops producing FSH so that no more eggs mature.
9. If no embryo implants, your estrogen and progesterone levels begin
to drop ten days or so after you ovulate.
The uterine endometrium produces prostaglandins (see Chapter 3 for
more about prostaglandins) that change the blood supply to the uterus
and stimulate uterine contractions. The thickened lining now sheds as
your menstrual period — a combination of blood, cells, and debris.
Normally, your endometrium is approximately 10 millimeters thick at the end
of your cycle. The shedding, along with blood from the torn blood vessels,
cervical mucus, endometrial tissue, and cellular debris, add up to a little
more than 30 milliliters (an ounce) of discharge, although it certainly seems
like a lot more! More than 80 milliliters (a little less than 3 ounces) of 
discharge is abnormal.
Menstrual blood normally doesn’t clot, unless your flow is very heavy.
Sometimes the lining is shed in large fragments (sometimes called decidual
casts) that can look like an early miscarriage.

Chapter 5: Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle 

Understanding how endometriosis 
affects your period
Endometriosis can interfere with your menstrual cycle in a number of ways.
Starting right from Day 1 of your cycle, endometriosis on or around your
ovary can interfere with your egg production. If you’re not planning on get-
ting pregnant, you may say, “So what?” But the whole purpose of the men-
strual cycle is the maturation, release, and implantation of an egg. Disrupting
the process in any way impacts your periods.
Although the exact reasons aren’t clear, endometriosis in and around the
ovaries can interfere with your period by
 Keeping a maturing egg from producing enough hormones, specifi-
cally estrogen and progesterone. When hormone levels are lower than
they should be, your periods may be shorter than normal.
 Destroying part of or the entire ovary, leading to early menopause, a
lack of ovulation, long cycles (more than 35 days apart), or irregular
bleeding.
 Causing inflammation that produces toxins that interfere with egg
growth and maturation.
What do short menstrual cycles mean?
What’s worse than having periods every four weeks? Having periods every
three weeks! When cycles are less than 21 days, a woman is said to have poly-
menorrhea. Short cycles are more than an inconvenience; they can be a sign
of luteal phase defect, or early ovulation. (See the sidebar “Luteal phase
defect: Running out of progesterone” and Chapter 7 for more on this condi-
tion and pregnancy.)
Women with short menstrual cycles may also be more likely to develop
endometriosis if they don’t already have it. This connection may exist
because of the retrograde menstruation theory (see Chapter 4 for more about
this theory). Bleeding more frequently means that more blood spills into the
pelvis, giving endometriosis more chances to grow where it doesn’t belong.
An occasional short cycle is nothing to worry about, but you may want to be
tested if your cycles are repeatedly short (less than 25 days apart). When
periods start less than 14 days after ovulation, you have luteal phase defect,
which can affect your ability to get pregnant.
88
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Early ovulation
Even though your period may start 14 days on the dot after ovulation, your
cycle may still be short because you’re ovulating very early, before Day 10 of
your cycle. Endometriosis can cause short cycles by destroying part of your
ovary, resulting in decreased ovarian reserve.
Why do some women ovulate early? The answer may be that
 It’s a normal variant (that is, it’s just how you are!).
 It’s a sign of perimenopause, the years leading up to menopause.
 You have decreased ovarian reserve because endometriosis has
destroyed part of your ovary.
 You have another endocrine problem.
89
Chapter 5: Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle 
Luteal phase defect: Running out of progesterone
Whether or not endometriosis can cause luteal
phase defect is somewhat controversial,
because studies have shown some evidence for
and some evidence against the connection.
As soon as the egg has matured and released,
the luteinizing hormone (LH) causes the cells of
the follicle to produce the hormone proges-
terone. At this point, the follicle is called a
corpus luteum, or yellow body, because the
molecular changes give these cells a yellow
color.
You can think of progesterone as the opposite
of estrogen. While estrogen causes the
endometrium to proliferate (grow) and the
glands of the breast to develop, progesterone
stops the growth and cell division in these tis-
sues. At that point, progesterone prompts the
endometrium to become more complex with the
development of glands, vacuoles (pockets of
energy), and spiral arterioles (coiled blood ves-
sels). All these changes make the endometrium
ready for the embryo to implant and grow.
However, when the ovary (the corpus luteum)
fails to produce enough progesterone, the
normal changes in the endometrium inside the
uterus may not happen. Or, the changes may 
not be in the correct sequence, or the timing
may be off. Your period comes earlier than
normal because you’re not making enough
progesterone to keep your period from starting
for a full two weeks — you’re running out of
progesterone early.
The lack of adequate progesterone is called a
luteal phase defect because the time between
egg release and menstruation is the luteal
phase. This condition can happen in women
without endometriosis, but it’s common in
women with the disease.

Are long cycles harmful?
Although having periods a few times a year doesn’t seem like such a bad
thing, it can be harmful. Endometriosis growing on your ovary can cause
infrequent periods by destroying part of the ovarian tissue. When this hap-
pens, your periods come much less frequently than normal. In fact, you may
ovulate and have periods only a few times a year. (See Chapter 3 for more on
the effects of endometriosis on your ovaries.)
Cycles that occur more than 40 days apart are called oligomenorrhea. Women
with oligomenorrhea often have problems getting pregnant and are at risk for
very heavy periods. Even worse, over time, oligomenorrhea can increase the
risk of overgrowth of the endometrium (called hyperplasia) and, in some
cases, endometrial cancer.
90
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Dealing with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)
If endometriosis has damaged your ovary to the
point where you’re not ovulating regularly, you
may have irregular bleeding. Sometimes you
bleed too much because the uterine lining
grows too thick before being shed, and some-
times you bleed in the middle of your cycle, 
usually at times when you least expect it.
Adenomyosis (endometriosis that infiltrates the
uterine wall) can also cause irregular bleeding.
Few women complain about bleeding too little
with their periods — bleeding too much is a far
more common complaint! However, bleeding
too much may be in the eye of the beholder.
Some studies show that approximately 50 per-
cent of the women who think they have heavier
than normal periods actually don’t.
Bleeding that doesn’t fit the norm — either in
timing or amount — is called abnormal uterine
bleeding (AUB). About 20 percent of women
with endometriosis have AUB. The primary
cause of AUB in women with endometriosis is
anovulation (lack of ovulation), although adeno-
myosis can also cause AUB. Abnormal bleeding
has some unpronounceable names:
 Menorrhagia: Bleeding too heavily every
month or for too many days
 Metrorrhagia: Bleeding at odd times
 Polymenorrhea: Periods occurring less
than 21 days apart
 Oligomenorrhea: Periods occurring more
than 35 days apart
 Menometrorrhagia: Excessive bleeding at
irregular intervals
The best way to deal with AUB depends on your
age and desire for future fertility (check out
Chapter 7 for more on other fertility issues). At
one end of the spectrum is benign neglect (do
nothing but have your pads and tampons ready).
At the complete other end is the ultimate way to
stop bleeding, a hysterectomy. However, most
of the time your options include medication to
regulate your cycles (see “Regulating Your
Menstrual Cycle to Reduce the Pain” later in
this chapter) or surgical treatments less final
than hysterectomy.
Never choose Ignore It as an option for dealing
with AUB. You and your doctor must consider
the possibility of cancer in cases of repeated
AUB.

A Pain by Any Other Name Is Still a
Pain, But Is It Endometriosis?
Do you experience monthly pain with your period? Occasional, mild pain
isn’t unusual. However, for recurrent and/or severe pain during your men-
strual cycle, you need to see your doctor so he can determine whether you
have endometriosis. Although the only way to definitely diagnose endometrio-
sis is through surgery, the pattern and type of pain you feel each month may
lead your doctor to a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis. Pain during or
around your period is a classic sign of endometriosis. (Check out Chapter 9
for more on how your doctor makes a presumptive diagnosis.)
Identifying the pain
Women with endometriosis tend to have pain that begins right before their
periods and lasts for several days. The pain of endometriosis may
 Be severe
 Worsen over time
 Be accompanied by nausea
 Be accompanied by diarrhea
 Be accompanied by back pain or leg pain
Don’t ignore painful periods. Consult your doctor right away if
 You have more severe pain than usual.
 The pain is different than usual.
 You run a fever.
 You have foul-smelling discharge (you could have an infection).
 You have an IUD that was placed less than three months ago.
 Your period was very light, you have pain, and you’re sexually active
(you could have an ectopic pregnancy; see Chapter 7 for more info).
What causes the pain?
You may feel powerless when you’re in pain during your period. Knowing the
cause of your pain may not make you feel better, but at least you can know
why you’re feeling so lousy.
91
Chapter 5: Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle 

The following are some of the causes of a painful period:
 Uterine cramping from high levels of prostaglandins
Prostaglandins (hormones released by the uterus) cause the cramping
that helps the uterus squeeze off the uterine lining and push it (along
with the blood) out of the uterus. Prostaglandin levels appear to be
much higher in women with painful periods than in women who experi-
ence few menstrual symptoms.
 Inflammation in your pelvis from the toxic chemical produced by
endometriosis implants
 Adhesions, or scar tissue, pulling on organs and tissues
 Irritation of nerves due to endometriosis implants
 Direct effect of endometriosis on the uterus, ovaries, or other organs
You can reduce much of the pain related to endometriosis by regulating your
menstrual cycle (see “Regulating your Menstrual Cycle to Reduce the Pain”
later in this chapter). Medication to prevent egg development and ovulation
can keep pain from showing up on a monthly basis. Obviously, these medica-
tions aren’t a good choice if you plan to get pregnant in the near future.
92
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Generally classifying menstrual pain
General pain with your period is formally called
dysmenorrhea, pronounced dis-men-or-ee-ah.
This pain usually lasts for the first two to three
days of your period. Painful periods are the
number one symptom described by women with
endometriosis.
Dysmenorrhea can be primary or secondary.
Primary dysmenorrhea has the following 
characteristics:
 Primary dysmenorrhea is unrelated to any
other disease process (such as endometrio-
sis). In other words, women with primary
dysmenorrhea don’t have endometriosis.
 Ninety percent of women with painful peri-
ods have primary dysmenorrhea.
 Primary dysmenorrhea usually starts 
within the first three years after you start
menstruating.
 Primary dysmenorrhea doesn’t usually start
in the first six months of a young woman’s
periods; ovulation may not occur for a few
months after her periods start. Painful peri-
ods in the first six months of menstruation
can be due to cervical or uterine problems
and should be checked out by a doctor.
Secondary dysmenorrhea has the following
characteristics:
 Secondary dysmenorrhea is usually caused
by physical disease.
 Endometriosis is the most common cause of
secondary dysmenorrhea.
 A number of other causes for secondary
dysmenorrhea are also possible. So having
secondary dysmenorrhea doesn’t mean you
definitely have endometriosis.

Regulating Your Menstrual Cycle 
to Reduce the Pain
To reduce the pain, you basically have two choices: medication and surgery.
This section briefly looks at your options. Chapter 10 looks more in-depth at
medication to treat endometriosis, while Chapter 11 discusses your surgical
options.
Using medication
One way to reduce the pain of endometriosis during your period is to regu-
late your menstrual cycle through the use of medication. These same medica-
tions can help if you also have irregular bleeding (AUB) (check out the
sidebar “Dealing with abnormal uterine bleeding [AUB]” earlier in this chap-
ter). Most of these medications stop the normal menstrual cycle of egg devel-
opment, ovulation, and progesterone production.
93
Chapter 5: Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle 
What’s with the mid-cycle pain?
Many women spend a day or two a month won-
dering whether they have appendicitis because
mittelschmerz (German for mid-cycle pain) on
your right side can mimic the symptoms of
appendicitis. But you can experience mit-
telschmerz without having endometriosis.
Mittelschmerz appears at the time of ovulation.
Twenty percent of women feel mid-cycle pain
at some time in their lives. The pain can be so
precise that many women know the exact
moment that they ovulate.
The rupture of the follicle housing the egg
causes mid-cycle pain. When the follicle rup-
tures, a small amount of follicular fluid and
blood escapes into the abdomen and can irri-
tate the abdominal lining, causing pain.
Mid-cycle pain has characteristics that are
unlike other pelvic pain:
 It’s recurrent each month.
 It’s one-sided.
 It lasts from a few minutes to one or two
days.
 It switches from one side to another,
depending on which ovary is ovulating.
 It’s usually a sharp, crampy pain.
 Women don’t usually have fever or other
organ-system symptoms.
Mittelschmerz is somewhat of a misnomer
because it doesn’t always occur in the middle
of your menstrual cycle. It actually occurs
approximately 14 days before the start of your
next period. So, if you have short cycles (around
23 days), mid-cycle pain occurs on Day 9. If your
cycles are long (around 35 days), mittelschmerz
occurs around Day 21.

Without the normal hormonal stimulation to the endometrial tissue, the
endometrium doesn’t bleed off, which means that endometriosis tissue 
doesn’t bleed either! The following hormonal medications are very effective
and may be all you need to get pain or irregular bleeding under control:
 Birth control pills: Both estrogen and a progestin in a convenient pack.
 Progestins: Two examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate (better
known by the more pronounceable name Provera) and norithindrone
acetate (Agyestin).
 Estrogen and progestin separately
 Hormone-impregnated IUD: Levonorgestrel intrauterine device.
 Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone agonist: Lupron or Zoladex are two
examples.
(These are, not surprisingly, the same medications we talk about in detail in
Chapter 10 as treatments for endometriosis!)
In most cases, your physician starts with hormonal therapy, unless you’re
planning on getting pregnant immediately. The exact treatment varies from
woman to woman. You and your doctor can decide on which therapy or ther-
apy combination is best for you.
Your doctor may first suggest you start taking ibuprofen before your period
begins as a treatment to control heavy bleeding. Obviously, this treatment
won’t help if your bleeding comes at odd times or isn’t predictable. Ibuprofen
is also very helpful in controlling menstrual pain.
Considering surgery
You can also consider surgery to regulate your painful period. Irregular bleed-
ing from endometriosis can be just a nuisance or it can become troublesome
enough to look for a remedy. When bleeding is very heavy, you can become
anemic (that is, have a low iron count). If medical therapy doesn’t work or you
can’t tolerate the hormones, your doctor may suggest a surgical option to
control irregular bleeding and to decrease pain. These options may be
 Dilation and curettage (D&C)
 Hysteroscopy
 Uterine artery embolization (UAE)
 Endometrial ablation (EA)
 Partial or total hysterectomy (all or part of the uterus)
94
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Which procedure you choose depends on your desires. If pregnancy is in
your future plans, then the only approved options are a D&C and hys-
teroscopy. Most surgeons combine these procedures during one operation.
Some doctors feel that uterine artery embolization is appropriate for women
seeking future pregnancy, but these doctors are in the minority. The data is
controversial at best, and the UAE isn’t approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for women who plan to have children. (Check out
Chapter 11 for more specifics about these procedures.)
Hello Menopause: Goodbye
Endometriosis?
For many women with endometriosis, there’s an end in sight; it’s called
menopause, the cessation of menstrual periods. Normally women stop having
periods between the ages of 45 and 55 because the ovaries produce less
estrogen and progesterone. At menopause, all (or almost all) primordial folli-
cles are used up so eggs can’t form. With no follicles or eggs, a woman’s body
doesn’t produce estrogen. As a result, the tissues that normally respond to
estrogen (like the endometrium and breast) no longer grow.
Because hormones are responsible for the symptoms of endometriosis and
because artificially induced menopause (with hormone therapy) often reduces
the pain of endometriosis, we can expect menopause to end endometriosis.
Although the pain of endometriosis continues into menopause for a small per-
centage of women, the end of menstrual periods is the end of pain for many
women.
This change may not happen all at once, but, after months without hormonal
stimulation, the endometrial tissue — no matter where it is — shrivels up
and, in a sense, dies. After the endometrial tissue dies, the endometrial cells
can no longer respond to estrogen. Even when the body continues to pro-
duce estrogen or a woman takes estrogen for menopausal symptoms, at some
point the endometrium isn’t able to respond.
Unfortunately, a few women don’t follow the rules. They may be taking estro-
gen for hormone replacement or making some estrogen themselves, so the
endometrium (in the uterus or pelvis) continues to react to it. These women
may still have symptoms of endometriosis after menopause. But for many 
(if not most) women, the end of periods is — fanfare, please — the end of
endometriosis.

F
ocusing on endometriosis and its effect on your period and your fertility
may not be that difficult. However, you may not realize that endometriosis
can affect other body systems as well. In fact, in very rare cases, endometriosis
has been found only outside the pelvis.
In this chapter, we look at how endometriosis can affect areas outside the
reproductive tract, from your intestines and urinary tract to your lungs and
even your head.
What a Gas! Endometriosis 
and Your Intestines
If they’re not out of order, you probably take your intestines (the interchange-
able term for bowels) for granted. When it’s working right, intestinal plumbing
is fairly predictable, reasonably painless, and only occasionally inconvenient.
But for many women with endometriosis, their intestines are truly in an
uproar much of the time.

98
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
That winding path of intestines is more complex than you may realize. For
starters, that path is much longer than it first appears — your large intestine
is 5 feet long and your small intestine is 20 feet— not exactly a short jaunt for
the food you swallow.
If you suspect that endometriosis is affecting your intestines, then this sec-
tion is for you. This section looks at how endometriosis can affect your
intestines, what you can do if you suspect you have endometriosis there,
what symptoms you need to look for, how your doctor diagnoses
endometriosis at this site, and what your treatment options are.
Twisting through your intestines
Before you can clearly understand the relationship between endometriosis
and your intestines, you need to understand what your intestines entail.
(Refer to Chapter 3 for more information on the intestines.) The intestines lit-
erally start at your mouth and esophagus and continue to the anus. The small
intestine is narrower and more coiled than the large intestine and has three
sections:
 Upper intestine (stomach and duodenum)
 Jejunum
 Ileum
Most digestion occurs in the small intestine. (The large intestine absorbs
water and solidifies waste that is excreted as stool, and that’s about it — a
dirty job, but something has to do it!)
The intestinal wall, both large and small, has three separate layers:
 The serosa, the thin, outside layer that’s also the continuation of the
peritoneum
 The muscle, which makes up most of the intestinal wall
 The mucosa, the thin, inside layer where absorption and secretion occur
The location of endometriosis on the intestines has a lot to do with your
symptoms. When the endometriosis is on the serosa, you likely have bloat-
ing, nausea, and loose stools during your period. If the endometriosis has
grown through the serosa and muscle layers to the mucosa, you may have
rectal bleeding during your period. Endometriosis on the intestines is more
common on the serosa and muscle layers and less common on the mucosa.
(Check out the next section for the different symptoms you may encounter if
endometriosis has invaded your intestines.)

Suspecting intestinal endometriosis
Intestinal problems are common in endometriosis — at least 30 percent of
patients, probably more, have some intestinal symptoms. But endometriosis
isn’t the first problem doctors think of when they hear patients complain
about intestinal issues. In fact, endometriosis may be the last diagnosis they
consider. Despite this fact, endometriosis in the intestines, not the pelvic
area, is the most common site for post-menopausal women.
You don’t have to have endometriosis on your intestines to have intestinal
symptoms; in fact, most people with symptoms don’t have endometriosis on
their intestines. Most symptoms are due to irritation from endometrial
implants in adjacent areas (such as the ligaments) and adhesions from other
areas to the intestines. In addition, inflammatory factors can affect intestinal
function just as they can affect other organs.
Endometriosis can cause the following intestinal issues:
 Abdominal bloating
 Abdominal pain
 Alternating constipation and diarrhea
 Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Intestinal cramping
 Nausea and/or vomiting
 Painful bowel movements
 Rectal bleeding
 Rectal pain
When patients do have endometriosis on their intestines, the implants are
usually superficial, which means they’re found just on the surface of the intes-
tine, and may be easy to remove. But, because most symptoms come from
inflammatory issues and not from the endometriosis implants themselves,
removal of the implants on the intestines may not cure the pain and cramping.
Sometimes endometriosis in areas right next to the intestines can cause
intestinal symptoms. This effect is most common near the uterosacral liga-
ments or rectovaginal septum (see Chapter 3 for more on these areas)
because the intestine is in contact with these areas. The inflammatory
process around these other areas can cause intestinal symptoms as well.
Adhesions that attach intestines to nearby organs can also cause intestinal
symptoms.
99
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts

Eying where endometriosis attacks the large intestine
Endometriosis is more common in the large intestine and can show up there
in many different ways. The following list shows the areas where endometrio-
sis can invade your large intestines and the symptoms it causes.
 The pelvic portion. Endometriosis most often affects the pelvic portion,
including the sigmoid colon (last section of the large intestine) and the
rectum. Meanwhile, the retroperitoneal (the length of intestine that
passes under the abdominal cavity covering, or peritoneum) part of the
large intestine can be shielded from endometriosis by this peritoneum.
The definition of true large intestine endometriosis is the presence of
deeply infiltrating endometrial-like glands and stroma more than 5 mil-
limeters under the peritoneum. However, shallower endometriosis on
the intestine can still cause symptoms as severe as the deeper disease.
 The nerves. Some studies have shown that deep endometriosis most
often affects the area along the nerves in the large intestine, which may
be the reason for the common symptoms of cramping and contractions
of the intestines. These cramps and contractions are the cause of consti-
pation and diarrhea that often accompany a patient’s period.
 The lumen. When endometriosis penetrates deep into the intestine, it
can bleed into the lumen (the open, interior area of the intestine that
leads to the outside of your body) and cause bleeding with bowel move-
ments. This bleeding can be bright red or darker in color, depending on
the location of the endometriosis.
100
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Endometriosis may even cause intestinal 
contractions and hypoglycemia
A study by Baylor University looked at a group of
women with endometriosis and found they had
increased frequency of contractions within the
muscle layer of the intestine, which can be
related to the production of prostaglandins and
other substances by the endometrial implants.
(Prostaglandins are produced in the endometrio-
sis and then released into the surrounding tis-
sues, blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue.) This
occurrence may also account for cramping and
intestinal symptoms in women who have
endometriosis in places besides the intestines.
Furthermore, the same study had another odd
conclusion: Women with endometriosis also
had reactive hypoglycemia (a drop in blood
sugar) during a glucose tolerance test, even
though the women had normal insulin levels.
Two possible reasons for this conclusion are
 Women with endometriosis may be more
sensitive to the actions of insulin than
women without endometriosis.
 Nerves that help control the actions of the
intestines may overreact to the amount of
insulin present.

 Near the uterus and cervix. Pain during sex can also be a characteristic
of large intestine endometriosis due to the proximity of the uterus and
cervix to the large intestine (these organs actually touch each other).
The movement of these organs during intercourse can cause irritation
and stretching of adhesions between them. (Refer to Chapter 3 for more
about the relationship of the intestine to the uterus and cervix.)
 The junction with the small intestines. Endometriosis near the junction
of the small and large intestines can result in right-side pain that can imi-
tate appendicitis. In fact, you can have endometriosis inside your appen-
dix! Because the appendix is a relatively common place to find
endometriosis and the symptoms are similar, some women have had an
appendectomy because of the confusion. Adhesions can also attach the
intestines to other nearby structures and cause pain there as well.

Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts
Differentiating between IBS and 
intestinal endometriosis
Two diseases that people easily confuse and
doctors misdiagnose are intestinal endometrio-
sis and irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. A lot
of people — up to one in five — have some
symptoms of IBS, and one in ten doctor visits
relates to its symptoms.
IBS can come and go, or it can become a
chronic condition. The symptoms — bloating,
cramping, diarrhea, and constipation — are
similar 
to 
the 
symptoms 
of 
intestinal
endometriosis, so you may not realize which
problem you have.
IBS symptoms are more common in women and
are more annoying during menses. Changes in
the nerves that control the contractions of the
intestinal wall may cause IBS. Endometriosis
has these same problems, making the diagno-
sis between the two conditions difficult.
If you or your healthcare provider can’t differ-
entiate between the two problems, you may
need a gastroenterology consult. Tests like a
barium enema, colonoscopy, and upper-GI
series with follow-through may give you a clue
to the problem. A CAT scan or MRI may help to
determine the cause of the problem, but are
expensive and really don’t add much informa-
tion. Blood tests may not help either. Many of
the same findings are present in both diseases.
If you don’t have a diagnosis of endometriosis but
do have symptoms that seem like IBS, your
doctor may treat you for IBS through diet, stress
reduction, and medications. No rule says you
can’t have more than one disease. If you already
have endometriosis and then develop IBS-like
symptoms, you may have both diseases (aren’t
you lucky!). The endometriosis may make your
IBS worse, so do whatever you can (such as
dietary and lifestyle changes) to control the IBS
while dealing with your endometriosis.

Recognizing a different plan of attack in the small intestine
Small intestine endometriosis causes different symptoms than in the large
intestine. The primary reason? The two parts of the intestine function in com-
pletely different ways. Although both are part of waste elimination, there are
differences in what they do, how they do it, and even in their physical struc-
ture, nerves, and enzymes.
The main concern you have with endometriosis in the small intestine is
bowel obstruction, which results in bloating and the inability to eat much
food at one time. These symptoms may be due to the fact that the small
intestine is, well, smaller. (Makes sense, doesn’t it?) Because of these logis-
tics, the small intestine has a greater chance for partial or complete obstruc-
tion of the lumen. This obstruction can cause very serious problems.
A lot of the large intestine is fixed, or immobile, behind the peritoneum.
However, the small intestine isn’t as bound down, or immobile. Because the
small intestine is very long and freer to move around, the adhesive bands of
endometriosis can restrict its movement, making it kink and bend around,
much like a garden hose can be obstructed by bending on itself.
Diagnosing (and treating) intestinal
endometriosis
Because endometriosis may not invade as deep as the mucosa, it’s almost
impossible to find during diagnostic tests, such as a barium enema or a
colonoscopy. As a result, the best way to diagnose intestinal endometriosis is
the best way to diagnose any endometriosis — surgically. But endometriosis
on the intestine may be difficult to see during either laparotomy or
laparoscopy. Both types of surgery have their advantages and disadvantages.
What are the main differences between the two surgeries in terms of diagnos-
ing endometriosis in the intestines?
 Laparotomy, a more invasive surgery, involves a large incision through
the abdomen. It has the advantage that the surgeon can run the intestine,
or examine the entire length, and check all areas by sight and by touch.
Sometimes the surgeon can’t see a deeper disease but can feel it with
trained hands. Also, the surgeon can do more extensive surgery at the
same time if he determines the patient needs it.
 Laparoscopy is less invasive and generally has an easier recovery.
Another advantage is that the scope magnifies the view by 1.5 to 2 times,
so your surgeon can find a more subtle disease. But, seeing all the small
intestine through the laparoscope is difficult, and feeling anything
through the laparoscope is impossible. Another problem is that very few
skilled surgeons can remove endometriosis from the intestine via
laparoscopy, so a second surgery may be necessary.
102
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Still, most of the time laparoscopy is the preferred method for diagnosis and
treatment. Surgeons perform laparotomies only for special or troublesome
cases. (We deal with surgical issues in more depth in Chapter 11, including
answering the question whether you really need surgery.) If the endometrio-
sis is only on the intestine’s serosa (surface), your doctor can excise or ablate
it (destroying the lesion by vaporizing, burning, denaturing, or otherwise
destroying the abnormal tissue). Discuss these approaches with your doctor
to be sure you’re both comfortable with the choice you make.
103
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts
Getting ready for a bowel prep
The phrase “This too shall pass” probably has
no greater significance than when you’re doing
a bowel prep (a cleansing of the intestines) to
reduce the risk of complications after the
surgery. (And remember the dual meaning to
this: It’s going to pass physically and mentally.)
So put your positive attitude hat on as we
answer your questions about a bowel prep.
1. Why do I have to do this? Bowel preps
empty your intestines of fecal material.
Why? Not just to keep the surgeon clean
during the procedure, although that’s part of
it. Stool can obscure the doctor’s view
during the procedure, it can increase the
chance of infection after the procedure,
and it can make a mess during the proce-
dure. These are three darn good reasons for
the bowel prep.
2. How can I make this easier on myself
beforehand? Eat lightly for a few days before
your prep, and avoid foods that are greasy
and bulky. What’s greasy and bulky? Foods
like fried chicken. Eat less meat and dairy
and more fruits and veggies. Also, don’t plan
any major events for the day of the prep. You
won’t be able to do much of anything —
unless you can do it in the bathroom.
3. What do I have to actually do? Starting one
or two days before surgery, you need to be on
a liquid diet. You also need to drink a prepa-
ration that removes (via the usual route) every
last bit of stool from your intestine.
4. How do I drink this (awful) stuff?!? Some
people find the preparation easier to drink
when it’s chilled. Other people find they can
get the taste out of their mouths with liquids,
gum, or hard candy. (Make sure your doctor
gives you the okay to use these “chasers.”)
Having a pleasant scent nearby may also
help. If you have to, spray a whiff of a
favorite scent on a handkerchief and hold
the handkerchief under your nose while you
drink.
5. How can I make the bathroom a fun place?
You spend a lot of time in there for a day or
two, so make it enjoyable. Scented candles,
lots of books if you’re a reader, and music
can all help. Put out your best towels so you
have something pretty to look at, and clean
up the cobwebs and clutter so they don’t
drive you crazy every time you’re in there.

If the endometriosis is deep and the surgeon can’t simply remove or destroy
only the abnormal tissue, the surgery involves entering the intestine. If your
doctor thinks you have a real chance for endometriosis of the intestine and
that he may have to operate on the large or small intestines, you have to do a
bowel prep, a cleansing of the intestines, to reduce the risk of complications
after the surgery. (Check out Chapter 11 for more on surgery and the nearby
sidebar “Getting ready for a bowel prep” for more info.)
104
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Removing damaged intestine when your deep
intestine endometriosis is severe
If you have deep intestinal endometriosis or the
intestine is injured while removing superficial
disease, the surgeon may have to remove a part
of the intestines. This is a fairly routine proce-
dure in a controlled situation, and a bowel prep
can make the surgery and your recovery much
simpler. (Fortunately, only about 1 to 2 percent
of women with endometriosis on the intestines
need this type of surgery.)
When the surgeon anticipates and plans the
removal of intestinal parts, he can perform a
primary anastomosis (reattaching of the new
intestinal ends with suture or staples) without a
colostomy (an opening through the abdominal
wall to remove waste) in most cases. And often
a surgeon can repair small insults to the intes-
tine wall (inadvertent or intentional) without
removing sections of intestine and without need
of a colostomy. These procedures, however,
depend on the location of the involved intestine,
blood supply, and healthiness of the tissue.
If the endometriosis has caused extensive scar-
ring and/or inflammation of the intestinal wall,
the best choice may be to remove this piece of
intestine because the surgeon may not be able
to determine the extent of tissue damage. But
attempting reattachment at the same time in an
unhealthy area may cause the intestine to break
down, leading to leakage and severe complica-
tions. So even though you had a bowel prep, the
surgeon may prefer to let the fresh ends of the
intestine mature and heal before putting them
back together.
In this case, the surgeon performs an interim
procedure, a diverting colostomy, where the
surgeon brings the end of the intestine (or a loop
of intestine) up through the abdominal wall and
sutures it in place. A bag is placed over the
opening on the outside of the abdomen to col-
lect the stool. Later, after the damaged section
of intestine has had a chance to heal and be rid
of the inflammation and compromised tissues,
the surgeon can reverse the colostomy and
reattach the intestine. Yes, doing so involves
another surgery, but it prevents multiple surg-
eries and peritonitis (infection of the abdominal
cavity) that can be life threatening. In most of
these cases, a general surgeon may help your
gynecologist.

Although the procedure of entering the intestines may sound simple, it’s
actually very involved, and the surgeon must be very careful. He must repair
any compromised areas immediately and expertly. In many cases, he must
remove whole sections of the intestine to insure that damaged and weakened
areas don’t cause future problems, including necrosis (essentially death) of
remaining sections due to subsequent breakdown, infections, leakage of
stool, and dysfunction of the intestine. When the surgeon must remove sec-
tions of the intestine, he also may perform a temporary colostomy (see the
nearby sidebar, “Removing damaged intestine when your deep intestine
endometriosis is severe”). Fortunately, only a small percent (1 to 2 percent)
of patients with endometriosis on the intestine need extensive surgery with
removal of part of the intestine.
In any event, when the surgeon removes endometriosis of the intestine, even
when it’s superficial, he must take great care to be sure not to compromise
the integrity of the intestine, being very careful and meticulous to avoid
severe complications. Be sure to discuss this procedure and its possible com-
plications with your doctor.
Endometriosis and Your Urinary Tract:
More Than Just Another Infection
Although the bladder is relatively near other organs in the pelvis,
endometriosis in the urinary tract itself is fairly rare. (Check out Chapter 3
for a full discussion of these organs.) However, if you or your doctor suspects
you have endometriosis in your urinary tract, then this section is for you. In
this section, we take a closer look at endometriosis in the urinary tract by
identifying some of the common symptoms, figuring out how to diagnose it,
and naming the best treatment options.
Naming the main symptoms
Endometriosis is more likely to appear in the bladder than in the ureters (the
tubes that take urine from the kidney to the bladder) or the kidneys, and the
lower ureters are a more common site than the upper ureters. Symptoms for
endometriosis in the urinary tract can include any of the following:
105
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts

Painful urination
Pain with urination isn’t unique to endometriosis; many problems, including
bladder infection and interstitial cystitis (chronic bladder inflammation) can
cause bladder pain. Furthermore, all bladder pains aren’t alike. For example,
bladder pain can feel like any or all of the following:
 Burning pain when you first start to urinate
 Pain at the end of urination, which can be sharp and knifelike
 Pain even when you’re not urinating; a constant feeling of spasm or pres-
sure in your bladder
 Feeling like you have to “go” all the time, even when you just went
 Tenderness over your pubic area related to your bladder
 Pain radiating up your back to your kidney
Endometriosis of the bladder can cause any of these preceding symptoms,
which is why it can be hard to diagnose and treat. You may mistake many of
your symptoms for urinary tract infections and may think your doctor can
just prescribe an antibiotic.
However, you need a urine sample. Having a urine analysis and culture to
check your urine for bacteria and other abnormalities is important, espe-
cially if you have seemingly endless urinary tract infections. Cultures will be
negative for bacteria when you have endometriosis or interstitial cystitis —
and antibiotics can do nothing to cure your symptoms. Unnecessary antibi-
otics can do more harm than good.
Blood in the urine during your period
Endometriosis in your bladder can cause blood in your urine. Blood in the
urine isn’t always visible to the naked eye. A large amount of blood can make
your urine look cloudy or a shade of red, but you may only see small clots of
blood in the bowl or on toilet paper after you wipe. If you have just a small or
moderate amount of blood in your urine, you may not be able to see it (espe-
cially if you use colored toilet paper and your toilet bowl water is blue from
the toilet bowl cleaner!). Here, a urine analysis can help find it.
Any time you have cloudy, dark, bloody, or scant urine, you should see your
doctor for a urine test to provide a clean catch specimen. First clean the urethra
(the tube leading from the bladder to the outside) and vaginal opening care-
fully with an antiseptic before urinating, and then let a small amount of urine
out and catch the midstream urine in a cup. A simple dipstick urine analysis
test can find pus, blood, sugar, bacteria, and other stuff in your urine.
106
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

If your doctor has any doubt about whether your urine sample is contami-
nated by improper cleaning, she may do a bladder catheterization. This pro-
cedure involves cleaning the urethra and vaginal opening with an antiseptic
and then inserting a small tube called a catheter directly into your bladder,
which prevents the bacteria in the vagina or on the skin from contaminating
the urine specimen.
After obtaining your specimen, your doctor can order a urine culture, which
tests for bacteria growth over a period of several days.
Other urinary symptoms
Endometriosis on the bladder can cause other urinary symptoms including
the following:
 Urinary frequency: Endometriosis on the bladder can irritate the organ
and cause you to urinate frequently. This symptom is unrelated to infec-
tion or IC but may be due to the inflammation caused by the
endometriosis. You urinate more often than normal even though your
bladder isn’t full.
 Urinary urgency: Endometriosis can also cause you to feel a sudden
need to urinate (and even to lose your urine). This is due to spasms that
come suddenly and uncontrollably.
 Urethral obstruction: Endometriosis can grow around the urethra and
compress it, much like running over your garden hose with a tire. This
can lead to retention of urine or incomplete emptying.
Understanding a cystoscopy
The only way to diagnose the problems with your bladder may be with a cys-
toscopy, a procedure that allows a specialist to look inside your bladder and
urethra. The procedure, which uses a very thin, lighted tube to examine and,
sometimes, treat problems inside your urinary tract, can take place in the
doctor’s office, at a free-standing surgical center, or at the hospital. The loca-
tion depends on how extensive your doctor expects the procedure to be and
the anesthesia you’ll need.
What should I expect during a cystoscopy?
Generally, you need no special preparation for a cystoscopy, unless you’re
having general anesthesia. In this case, you need to follow your anesthesiolo-
gist’s instructions about not eating or drinking before the surgery. You’ll have
local anesthetic and/or intravenous sedation to make the procedure more
comfortable. Usually you don’t have to stay in the hospital overnight.
107
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts

The lab will check your urine before the procedure to make sure you don’t
have an infection at the time. The procedure follows these easy steps:
1. You lie on your back with your knees apart and your feet in footrests.
2. The doctor inserts the tip of the cystoscope into the urethra and then
advances it up into the bladder.
3. The doctor first fills your bladder with saline or sterile water through
a sterile catheter so he can examine all areas of the bladder.
This expansion can cause a feeling of urgency, which can be somewhat
uncomfortable. Deep breathing and relaxing your pelvic muscles can
help you through this part of the exam.
4. You can empty your bladder as soon as the exam is over.
The whole exam usually takes less than 20 minutes. Afterwards you may
feel slight stinging when you urinate, and you may notice a small amount
of blood in your urine. These symptoms are normal.
However, you need to tell you doctor immediately if you have any of the 
following:
 Chills and/or fever
 Cloudy or foul smelling urine
 Dribbling of urine
 A lot of blood or clots in your urine
 Inability to urinate 8 hours after the procedure
 Mild symptoms lasting longer than 24 hours
 Severe pain
Try to drink enough liquids to urinate well every two hours after the proce-
dure. A warm, moist washcloth over the urethra may feel soothing when you
have pain. Ask your doctor about when you can take a warm bath. You may
need to take an antibiotic for a few days to ward off infection. If your urethra
is very swollen, you may need a catheter to drain your urine until the
swelling subsides.
Why may I need a biopsy during cystoscopy?
Your doctor may decide to biopsy any suspicious-looking tissue inside the blad-
der or urethra. This involves removing a small piece of tissue from the bladder
wall during the cystoscopy and then examining it under the microscope for 
evidence of endometriosis or other disease processes, like interstitial cystitis
108
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

(see the nearby sidebar “Differentiating between interstitial cystitis and
endometriosis in the bladder” in this chapter). The biopsy is relatively painless
and can be very useful in the diagnosis. Afterwards, you may have some slight
bleeding as with a regular cystoscopy.
Treating urinary tract endometriosis
Unfortunately, as with so many types of endometriosis, curing the disease in
the urinary tract isn’t possible. The goal of treatment is to decrease symp-
toms and prevent worsening of the disease. Your doctor tries to accomplish
this with a nonsurgical approach, such as hormonal treatment and other
medications, in most cases (see Chapter 10 for more info).
In severe cases of endometriosis of the bladder, your doctor can perform
surgery to remove part of the bladder (called a partial cystectomy) or other
involved areas. But, the implants are usually superficial inside the bladder or
on the pelvic surface of it, so this procedure is rare. The endometriosis doesn’t
affect the bladder nearly as often as the intestines, and medical therapy seems
to work well.
109
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts
Differentiating between interstitial cystitis and
endometriosis in the bladder
Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a complicated disease —
many doctors feel it may actually be several dis-
eases that can cause symptoms identical to those
of endometriosis. IC is a chronic inflammation of
the bladder affecting mostly women. Symptoms
occur when the immune system allows the pro-
tective coating of the bladder to wear away in
small areas, exposing the bladder wall to irritants.
So, like endometriosis, IC may have an autoim-
mune component.
The protective coating, with the really long tech-
nical name glycosaminoglycanmucus-mucin
layer, normally allows the urine to sit in the blad-
der for hours without causing any symptoms.
When this layer is missing, the underlying cells
can become irritated. Although the bladder has
no infection, the symptoms of painful urination
with urgency and frequency are the same symp-
toms you may feel if you have a urinary tract
infection.
The best way to differentiate between the two
conditions is through a cystoscopy. If you have
IC, your doctor can see pinpoint hemorrhages
on the bladder wall during the cystoscopy. The
effectiveness of treatment is still controversial,
but medications and minor procedures are
available.

More common is disease that has scarred the tissues around the ureter. This
scar tissue can retract and actually kink and obstruct the ureter. This can
lead to kidney problems and even loss of the kidney. In this extreme case,
your doctor may advise the careful removal of the scar tissue to prevent any
long-term kidney complications. This surgery is delicate and difficult, and
your gynecologist may have a urologist assist.
Most people automatically assume that bladder pain or pain on urination is
an infection. You may be tempted to treat yourself when you have bladder
symptoms by taking any old antibiotics you have lying around the house.
Doing so is a bad idea for a couple of reasons. First of all, you may not have a
urinary tract infection at all. Second, even if you do have an infection, the
antibiotic you’re taking may not cure the specific bacteria that normally
infect the bladder. The antibiotic may suppress symptoms just enough to
make you think you’re cured, but treating with the wrong antibiotic can actu-
ally escalate a bladder infection into a kidney infection by allowing the bacte-
ria to continue to multiply.
Endometriosis in Your Lungs: Coughing,
Chest Pain, and Breathing Problems
Endometriosis in your lungs isn’t common, and it can be really hard to diag-
nose because your doctor won’t think of it when you come in coughing up
blood. You may not even think to tell him you’re having your period, and he’s
unlikely to ask.
Diagnosing endometriosis in the lungs, or thoracic endometriosis, requires an
inquiring mind. Even if you know you have endometriosis elsewhere, you
may think that relating it to your lung problems is too far fetched. Thoracic
endometriosis can cause many different symptoms, all seemingly unrelated
to your pelvis. But suspecting thoracic endometriosis is the first step to diag-
nosing it, and you may be more likely to make the connection than your
doctor, especially after reading this book.
Thoracic endometriosis causes different symptoms, depending on the loca-
tion of the lesions. Endometriosis can be either in the lung tissue (the
parenchymal tissue), or in the lining of the lung (the pleural tissue).
Endometriosis is about five times more common in the pleura than in the
parenchymal tissue.
This section looks at how endometriosis manifests itself in the different lung
tissues and how your doctor can diagnose endometriosis in your lungs.
110
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Endometriosis in the lining 
of the lung (pleura)
More than 90 percent of cases of pleural endometriosis are on the right side.
Often small holes are in the diaphragm, the muscular membrane that sepa-
rates the abdominal and thoracic cavities. Most patients with pleural
endometriosis also have pelvic endometriosis. One theory is that
endometriosis travels through the small holes in the diaphragm. When
endometriosis is in the pleural tissue, the most common symptoms are
 Difficulty breathing
 Pain
 Pain with breathing motions
 Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)
 Pleural effusion (fluid on the lung)
 Shortness of breath
Endometriosis in the lung tissue
(parenchyma)
Parenchymal endometriosis, an uncommon disease, has a completely different
course and probably a different way of spreading than pleural endometriosis.
Most patients with parenchymal endometriosis cough up blood during their
period but don’t have pain or trouble breathing.
Also, patients with parenchymal endometriosis often don’t have pelvic
endometriosis but do have a history of pelvic surgery or vaginal delivery.
Note: One theory of how endometriosis arrives in the lung tissue is that the
endometrial cells spread through the blood vessels as emboli (small clots
that travel through the blood stream). (You may have heard about these clots
from varicose veins in the legs causing severe problems!)
Diagnosing thoracic endometriosis
The key to diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis is suspicion that it’s there. A
chest X-ray, CAT scan, or MRI may help visualize the lesions. A bronchoscopy
or thoracoscopy with biopsy may help to differentiate between endometriosis
111
Chapter 6: Looking Closer at How Endometriosis Also Affects Other Body Parts

and other diseases, including malignancy. These procedures are usually per-
formed on an outpatient basis, depending on how extensive the surgery
becomes. A pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon performs these tests for you.
Treating thoracic endometriosis
Thoracic endometriosis can be treated with hormonal suppression or with
surgical removal of scar tissue and endometrial lesions via thorascopy
(laparoscopy of the pleural space and thorax). (Check out Chapters 10 and 11
for more info about drugs and surgical treatments.)
Endometriosis in Your Brain: 
Rare, but Possible
The idea of endometriosis ending up in the place farthest from its initial
source may sound impossible, but it’s true — endometriosis can, in rare
cases, end up in your brain. (So no matter what some people think,
endometriosis is definitely not just in your head.) Obviously, more than retro-
grade menstruation must send endometrial tissue all the way up to your
head, so endometrial tissue must arrive there via one of the other theories of
endometriosis transmission. (See Chapter 4 for the theories on how
endometriosis travels all over your body.)
Cerebellar endometriosis, or endometriosis in your brain, can cause
headaches, seizures, or, in very rare cases, bleeding in the brain. The diagno-
sis may be aided by CAT scan or MRI. A spinal tap (placing a small needle into
your back to get spinal fluid out) may show blood or endometrial cells. Cases
of endometriosis in the brain are rare, so standard treatments don’t exist.
Brain removal usually isn’t an option! Most of the time, doctors prescribe
medical treatments, such as hormone-suppressing drugs (see Chapter 10) to
decrease symptoms.

Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Figuring Out Why Endometriosis Is 
a Major Cause of Infertility
Many women find out they have endometriosis because they’ve been unsuc-
cessful at trying to get pregnant. They never mentioned the menstrual
cramps, diarrhea, and pain that come with every period to their doctor
(probably because their mom told them those symptoms were just part of
being a woman). But now, after six months of trying to have a baby, they’re
beginning to suspect that mom’s advice (“Just relax and you’ll get pregnant!”)
may not be all that accurate.
How big a deal is endometriosis when you’re trying to have a baby?
Endometriosis can be a very big deal, depending on where it is and how
much you have. Are there ways to overcome endometriosis and have that
bundle of joy you dream of? Yes, but it’s not always easy — or cheap. But,
first we give you a quick review of the normal steps to pregnancy so our dis-
cussion of endometriosis and infertility is easy to understand. We also look at
the number of women with fertility problems due to endometriosis — you’ll
see that you’re not alone!
A quick overview: The steps to pregnancy
Pregnancy may seem like a sure bet each month you try, but even when you
have everything in place, you may not get pregnant because Mother Nature
isn’t as efficient as people think. The fact is, even with the proper ingredients
and timing, women under age 35 have only a 17 percent chance of becoming
pregnant each month. That means the average woman will conceive less than
one out of five cycles. If you’re older, your chances each month are even less;
eventually you reach menopause, where the chance is zero.
The following steps show the normal path leading to pregnancy:
1. A woman’s menstrual cycle begins each month on the first day the
outer layer of the endometrium is shed as menstrual flow.
2. This occurrence signals the start of the first phase of the cycle, the
proliferative or follicular phase.
The hormone estrogen (the most active one being 17-beta-estradiol)
causes the growth or proliferation of eggs containing follicles (check out
the sidebar in this chapter, “Creating a good egg,” for more info).

3. The ovaries start to form many early eggs, or antral follicles.
One antral follicle becomes dominant (more than one is rare, but twins do
happen!), and this dominant follicle produces more and more estrogen.
4. The endometrium starts to thicken in preparation to house a future
embryo.
5. As soon as the dominant follicle grows enough to become a mature
egg, a woman ovulates — that is, the ovary releases the egg to be fer-
tilized — and this egg is picked up by the fallopian tube.
This is an essential step to getting pregnant because you can’t get preg-
nant if your egg never gets out of the starting gate and into the fallopian
tubes to meet the sperm of its dreams!
6. The egg enters the fallopian tube and gets fertilized by a friendly
sperm.
7. The fertilized egg floats gently all the way down the fallopian tube
without getting stuck or otherwise sidetracked.
Although embryos can — and, unfortunately, do — implant in the fallop-
ian tube, this is never a workable arrangement (the tube is so narrow
that a six-pound baby will never fit!). The tube can rupture if the preg-
nancy grows too long there, with life-threatening consequences for Mom.
(We discuss ectopic pregnancy later in this chapter.)
8. After ovulation, the uterine lining changes again under the influence
of progesterone from the corpus luteum (the leftover shell of the folli-
cle) to provide support for an embryo, should one show up.
If anything interferes with, blocks, or prevents one of these steps, pregnancy
can’t occur or early miscarriage may occur. And if no embryo arrives, hor-
mone levels drop, and the lining begins to shed again as in Day 1 of the cycle.
Unfortunately, endometriosis can interfere with the perfect progression of
these steps in many ways.
Each stage of endometriosis (usually noted as Stage I through IV, with IV the
most severe) can affect different aspects of fertility. These variables make it
very difficult to accurately predict your fertility. (Check out Chapter 9 for
more on what the different stages mean.)

Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Whose fertility is affected
by endometriosis?
Although you may feel like you’re the only one in the world not able to get
pregnant, you’re not alone. Having trouble getting pregnant is a major con-
cern for women with endometriosis. The following statistics show the wide-
spread effects of this disease on infertility:
 About one in six couples suffers from infertility. That’s a lot of people —
about 6 million people (2 to 3 million couples) in the United States alone.
 Endometriosis is responsible for around 30 percent of these infertility
cases.
 Thirty percent of laparoscopic surgeries for unexplained infertility result
in a diagnosis of endometriosis.
 About 40 percent of women with endometriosis have some degree of
infertility.
116
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
How long should I try to get pregnant on my own?
Most people start trying to get pregnant with the
attitude that it will occur quickly, like five min-
utes after they consider the idea! Unfortunately,
becoming pregnant isn’t easy for many women
with endometriosis — although, if your endo-
metriosis is mild, you may get pregnant just as
fast as the next guy (or girl, in this case). How
long you should try before seeing your doctor
depends somewhat on your age and circum-
stances, but the following guidelines may be
helpful:
 Under age 35: After one year. (This assumes
you have the patience to wait a year. We
don’t know many people who can wait this
long!)
 Over age 35: After six months. (Ditto the
above.)
 Over age 40: Make an appointment before
you start trying, or as soon as possible. You
don’t have as much time to lose, and you
may want to discuss other considerations
with your doctor.
If you know you have mild endometriosis, see
your doctor sooner than the guidelines suggest.
And, if you have moderate or severe endo-
metriosis or suspect you have, see your doctor
before you start trying because
 You may need help getting pregnant.
 Your risk of problems (such as an ectopic
pregnancy) is significant.

However, the news on pregnancy and endometriosis isn’t all bad. Consider
that
 As many as 70 percent of women with minimal or mild endometriosis
and infertility do conceive within three years without any therapy.
 Studies show that surgical treatment of minimal or mild endometriosis
increases pregnancy rates even more.
 In one study, more than 40 percent of women with moderate or severe
endometriosis became pregnant after surgery.
 In vitro fertilization (IVF) has helped many women conceive, even in pre-
viously hopeless cases. (Check out “Is In Vitro Fertilization [IVF]
Necessary?” later in this chapter for more info about IVF.)
Endometriosis In, Around, 
and On Your Ovaries
Ovaries are one of the most common sites for endometriosis. Endometriosis
here can gum up the works, so to speak, and interfere with pregnancy by
 Keeping an egg from developing normally
 Destroying much of the ovary, which also destroys eggs
 Preventing an egg from releasing by
• Encasing it with endometrial tissue and scar tissue
• Interfering with the normal mechanism of egg release
 Causing an immune response that’s detrimental to fertilization
Ovarian endometriosis was the first endometriosis to be seen microscopi-
cally, and it can develop on the surface of the ovary or bury itself deep
inside. This section looks more closely at how endometriosis affects the
ovaries and causes infertility.

118
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Creating a good egg
The first step in pregnancy is the development of
a mature egg that’s capable of becoming a baby.
This step seems simple enough, considering the
number of people on this earth, but it’s an
extremely complex process that begins when
you’re a fetus in your mother’s womb. Consider
the following:
 All the eggs you’ll ever have are present and
accounted for by Week 20 gestation (about
halfway through a normal pregnancy). Unlike
men, you will never produce any more
gametes (eggs in you, sperm in him) and you
will lose all of them by menopause.
 The eggs live in early shells called primor-
dial follicles. The eggs are in a sort of sus-
pended animation and don’t change until
puberty and the call to ovulation.
 Nature is never perfect. In fact, it’s far from
perfect, and makes up for this imperfection
by sheer numbers. So men produce millions
of sperm over and over to get a few good
men. But women never make more eggs —
you’re stuck with the ones you have (which
is one of the reasons only about one in five
ovulations results in a pregnancy).
 When you begin menstruating, a number of
hormonal changes happen in the ovary to
stimulate a bunch of primordial follicles to
develop. Early in your reproductive life, hun-
dreds of primordial follicles appear, and, as
you near menopause, you have fewer and
fewer to choose from. But, no matter how
many of these follicles begin each cycle,
only one (with a few exceptions, as in frater-
nal twins) continues to develop past the first
few days. The rest die off, never to be seen
again.
 Each month, the dominant follicle interacts
with the surrounding ovarian tissue until it is
ready to be fertilized. On the final steps
toward maturation
The egg has the correct number of chromo-
somes.
The cytoplasm (the liquid around the
nucleus) is capable of orchestrating the pen-
etration of the sperm and the first few cell
divisions.
In menopause, no eggs remain (or at least no
more that can function normally), and a woman
stops producing estrogen and progesterone.
There’s no turning back; the chances of releasing
a good egg (or any egg) are over — or extremely
slim.

Understanding the link between
endometriosis and egg development
Endometriosis has four classifications of severity, from Stage I to Stage IV
(see Chapter 9 for more on endometriosis staging), and different stages
impact egg development in different ways.
Early-stage endometriosis and your ovaries
Early-stage disease, Stage I (minimal) and Stage II (mild) endometriosis, seems
to cause different problems related to egg production:
 Even with in vitro fertilization (IVF), implantation rates are lower than
normal.
 Early-stage endometriosis seems to cause poor embryo quality, which is
related to either poor egg quality or poor sperm quality.
Stage I and II endometriosis appear to have a worse effect on egg develop-
ment than Stage III and IV disease. But this theory doesn’t make sense! Why
are the earlier stages worse on the eggs? The following explanations are 
possible:
 The early stages are very active with growth of the endometrial tissue
and production of destructive proteins, enzymes, and cells. These toxic
substances and cells may have a detrimental effect on the development
of the egg.
 The toxic substances may damage the egg after it’s released into the
pelvic cavity, before or after fertilization.
 The later stages of endometriosis are mostly burnt out (no longer 
growing) and are much less metabolically active than the earlier 
stages.
This situation isn’t hopeless, however. One of the basic treatments for infer-
tility is superovulation, stimulating drugs to help the follicles produce
more/better eggs. (Check out “Starting with Simple Treatments” later in this
chapter for more info.)
119
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Severe endometriosis and your ovaries
Endometriosis is classified as severe depending on the amount of
endometriosis you have, where it’s located, and how far it’s advanced (see
Chapter 9 for how endometriosis is staged). Severe endometriosis, typically
Stages III (moderate) and Stage IV (severe), decreases your chance of getting
pregnant in the following ways:
 Distortion of the anatomy (blocking tubes, causing scar tissue)
 Loss of fimbriae, the fingerlike projections that guide the egg into the fal-
lopian tubes
 Loss of ovarian volume (which decreases the number of eggs)
These problems don’t mean pregnancy is impossible. Studies have shown
that an embryo (fertilized egg) implanted via IVF into the uterus (thereby
bypassing the fallopian tubes and fimbriae) of a woman with severe disease
has the same chance of pregnancy as in women without endometriosis.
Processing how endometriosis 
destroys ovarian tissue
Researchers and doctors know that endometriosis can hinder egg develop-
ment, especially in early stages of the disease. But when a woman has the
late-stage disease (which is metabolically less active), why is achieving preg-
nancy still hard?
One major reason for this problem is the loss of ovarian reserve (the medical
term for decreased number of eggs). You only have a finite number of eggs to
last your whole reproductive life (check out the sidebar “Creating a good
egg” in this chapter). If that number decreases for any reason, you may run
out earlier than usual and have premature menopause. This decreased ovar-
ian reserve leaves you with fewer good eggs — possibly no good eggs — for a
pregnancy.
How does endometriosis decrease ovarian reserve, causing you to lose eggs?
In simple terms, the advancing process of endometriosis destroys the ovar-
ian tissue. The following steps indicate this process:
1. Endometriosis implants on the surface of the ovary (not inside).
2. The misplaced endometrial tissue begins its monthly growth and 
shedding.
120
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

The repeated growth and bleeding on the surface of the ovary causes an
inflammatory response that releases toxins and irritants that begin to
produce scar tissue around the endometrial implants.
3. The endometrial implants are encased in this scar tissue.
The implants follow the path of least resistance and grow into the ovary
instead of spreading over the surface.
4. The destructive process literally eats away the area of the ovary that
houses the primordial follicles, leaving you with less ovarian tissue
(and thus fewer follicles).
Encountering endometriomas (chocolate cysts)
Scar tissue that covers the surface of endometrial implants on the ovary is
tough and fibrous. As this endometriosis spreads across the ovary, it takes
the path of least resistance by growing into the softer stroma (the inside) of
the ovary. As a result, chocolate cysts, or endometriomas, form from the sur-
face of the ovary inwards. (The term chocolate refers to the brown-colored
liquid made of old blood and tissue that’s inside the cyst.)
These cysts of endometriosis aren’t true cysts. Note: A normal cyst is filled
with fluid from the lining of a structure. The walls of an endometrioma, how-
ever, are different because they consist of fibrous tissue, inflammatory mater-
ial, and endometrial tissue — none of which produce fluid.
As the endometrioma expands, the following process occurs:
1. The endometrioma squeezes out and compresses nearby normal ovar-
ian tissue.
2. Because the normal ovarian tissue has nowhere to go, it stops func-
tioning and may eventually die.
3. When ovarian tissue stops functioning, it disrupts the normal hor-
monal environment of the ovary, which can then affect the menstrual
cycle and cause an early menopause.
Dr. K had a young patient with problems of infertility but no other com-
plaints. On examination, he discovered huge endometriomas on each ovary.
These cysts were so large that this 28-year-old woman had only a thin layer of
ovary with virtually no ovarian tissue. She never did get pregnant.
Losing ovarian tissue during surgery
Ovarian tissue can also be lost as a result of surgery. Any time a surgeon tries
to remove endometriosis or the consequences of the disease (adhesions and
other scarring), the surgery can harm the ovary.
121
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

When a surgeon attempts to remove adhesions that glue the ovary to the
intestines, fallopian tube, or uterus, he must take great care to protect all of
these structures. Unfortunately, if a structure has to be sacrificed, it’s usually
the ovary because injury to the ovary doesn’t cause dire results to your
health. On the other hand, injury to the other structures can lead to bleeding,
life-threatening infection, or ectopic pregnancy. The prudent surgeon is usu-
ally conservative and doesn’t risk intestinal, bladder, or tubal damage.
No matter how careful a doctor is, the ovary inevitably loses some pieces
along with the chocolate cyst because just the process of cutting into the
ovary to remove the cyst wall and its contents invariably damages some of
the ovary. And even in the best scenario (when the surgeon removes no
tissue), suturing the ovary back together destroys some of the ovary.
Losing even a small amount of ovarian tissue results in decreased ovarian
reserve and possible infertility. Ask your doctor what method he prefers to
use in surgery and why (check out Chapter 11 for different surgical methods).
Let him explain to you the pros and cons of all the options. In the end, it’s
your body and you have the final say.
Looking at luteinized unruptured 
follicle syndrome (LUF)
For whatever reason, women with endometriosis are more likely to have a
problem with egg release and infertility due to luteinized unruptured follicle
syndrome (LUF).
An egg that never leaves the ovary can never be fertilized and find its way to
the uterus. Some women with endometriosis may not release the egg from
the ovary, even though everything may be going swimmingly (no, wait, that’s
sperm). In other words,
1. The egg develops to maturity (on its own or with the help of fertility
drugs).
2. The levels of estrogen rise appropriately, the luteinizing hormone (LH)
surges (again, either naturally or with help), and progesterone rises.
3. Just when everything’s looking great, nothing happens!
The egg stays right where it is, in the ovary.
If your doctor doesn’t do an ultrasound after you ovulate, he may miss the
egg’s lack of movement. Because doctors usually monitor estrogen and prog-
esterone, these hormones may still rise appropriately, fooling your doctor
into thinking all systems are go. An ultrasound may even show a normal-size
follicle, but a follow-up test a few days later still shows that the follicle hasn’t
shrunk as it should.
122
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

The reason for LUF is unclear. However, the following are possible causes:
 The scarring and adhesions on and around the ovary can make it impos-
sible for the egg to get out of its follicle, as if it’s encased in concrete.
Normally follicle cells near the ovary’s surface dissolve the layers sur-
rounding the egg so the egg can flow out with the follicular fluid.
Hormonally everything happens just as it should — but the egg can’t
escape.
Surgery to clear these adhesions and scar tissue may help in these
cases. IVF, which removes the egg from the follicle with a needle, may
also be successful.
 Endometriosis may interfere with the complicated processes in the sur-
face of the ovary that allow the egg to rupture and escape.
 Inflammatory reactions may interfere with the interaction of all the
above complicated processes.
Interfering with a Good 
Uterine Environment
Developing a good egg, having it fertilize, and making sure it journeys down
the tube to the uterus is only half the battle. As soon as the fertilized egg gets
to the uterus, it has to successfully implant and grow. Endometriosis has sev-
eral ways of preventing an embryo from implanting after it reaches the
uterus. This section takes a closer look at those ways.
Checking out other hormonal problems:
Luteal phase defect
Your menstrual period usually arrives 14 days after ovulation, unless you’re
pregnant. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD, luteal referring to the
time after ovulation) can cause your period to arrive sooner than 14 days.
This shortened luteal phase means the embryo doesn’t have time to implant
well and results in an early miscarriage.
A shortage of progesterone can cause LPD. Ideally, the leftover follicle shell
(the corpus luteum) from the developed egg generates progesterone after you
ovulate. But, when the follicle generates too little progesterone, the result is a
shorter time between ovulation and the start of your next period.
123
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Progesterone plays important roles in helping a new pregnancy take root:
 It changes your uterine lining to make it into a nourishing place for an
embryo to implant.
 It affects the appearance of receptors for implantation of the embryo.
(These receptors make it possible for the embryo to attach to the
endometrium and burrow in for the long haul, so to speak.)
The receptors are present for only a short time and must be there when
the embryo floats by. If they’re not present or the embryo’s timing is off,
pregnancy can’t occur.
Why doesn’t a corpus luteum make enough progesterone? A couple of possi-
bilities are
 Endometriosis may affect the ovary’s ability to produce normal amounts
of both estrogen and progesterone, just as it affects the egg’s matura-
tion. (See “Understanding the link between endometriosis and egg devel-
opment” in this chapter for additional information on egg maturation
and endometriosis.)
 Endometriosis can somehow decrease the corpus luteum’s ability to
make enough progesterone at the right time.
Noting the chemical effects 
of endometriosis
Endometriosis can have serious chemical effects on peritoneal fluid (the fluid
that accumulates in the abdominal cavity) and other parts of the reproduc-
tive tract. These chemical changes can make fertilization and implantation
difficult. Because the peritoneal fluid is in constant contact with the ovaries
and fallopian tubes, any toxic chemicals from the fluid can affect the ovaries
and tubes, as well as the eggs, sperm, and embryo.
Some of the possible effects from toxic chemicals include
 Peritoneal fluid that interferes with sperm motility or movement.
 An overproduction of prostaglandins, especially Prostaglandin E2.
An excess of prostaglandins may interfere with their assistance in the
fertilization and implantation of the embryo. Prostaglandins also cause
uterine contractions that may interfere with embryo transport and
implantation.
124
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

 An overproduction of white blood cells and immunoglobulins in the peri-
toneal fluid.
Although your body’s white cells make immunoglobulins to help protect
you from infection and other diseases, an excess of these immunologi-
cally active cells and proteins may damage normal tissue.
Evaluating enzyme abnormalities
Women with endometriosis appear to have a number of genetic enzyme
abnormalities that may allow endometriosis to develop and attach more
easily where it doesn’t belong (see Chapter 4 for more about genes and
endometriosis).
One recent study found that some women with endometriosis-related infertil-
ity lack an enzyme necessary for an embryo to implant. The enzyme holds a
molecule called L-selectin to the uterine wall. Without L-selectin in place at
the proper time of the menstrual cycle, an embryo can’t attach to the uterus
and grow.
Messing with Your Fallopian Tubes
A blocked fallopian tube is like a dead-end road; your egg isn’t going any-
where. Fallopian tubes are, unfortunately, common sites for endometriosis;
the disease can block the tubes anywhere from the opening at the top to the
bottom near the uterus. And blocking an egg from the uterus or the sperm
from the egg pretty much prevents a healthy pregnancy.
In this section, we focus on the fallopian tubes to see how endometriosis can
block the tubes and cause infertility. We also discuss a serious concern that
endometriosis can cause — the ectopic pregnancy.
Adhesions tangle your fallopian tubes
A body’s inflammatory response to endometrial implants can cause adhe-
sions, or scar tissue, that really snarl up your fallopian tubes. Common sites
for paratubal (around the tube) adhesions to form and, as a result, interfere
with fertilization or egg/embryo transport are
125
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

 By the fimbriae (at the ovarian end of the tube). When the fimbriae
become entangled in adhesions, the tube has trouble picking up the egg
after ovulation.
 Around the outside of the tube (causing the tubes to stick to the uterus,
pelvic wall, or intestine).
 Inside the tube itself, making it difficult for an egg to get through the
tube to the uterus or the sperm to get to the egg.
Blocked tubes can cause 
ectopic pregnancy
The word ectopic means outside. So an ectopic pregnancy is outside the
uterus and usually, but not always, inside the fallopian tube. Very rarely,
ectopic pregnancies can implant in the abdomen or in the ovary itself,
although approximately 95 percent implant in the fallopian tubes.
The damage that endometriosis does to the fimbriae and the tubes in general
greatly increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Damage to the fimbriae or
tubes can cause the following potentially dangerous scenarios:
 The disease can inhibit egg pick-up so the egg never gets into the tube.
If the egg doesn’t get into the tube, it can’t get to the uterus. If sperm
manage to reach the egg, the fertilized egg can implant in the abdominal
cavity or even in the ovary. These cases are very rare, but they do
happen.
 Adhesions around the tube can cause kinking. This kinking may cause
partial obstruction somewhere in the tube so that the fertilized egg gets
stuck in the tube. Note: The sperm are a thousand times smaller than an
egg so they can get through these narrowed areas.
If you have a blocked tube, you may end up with an ectopic pregnancy in any
of the locations shown in Figure 7-1.
Your uterus is the only part of your body that’s capable of carrying a preg-
nancy. No other area has the supporting structures to allow the fetus to draw
nutrients from you without doing you harm. When a pregnancy implants
somewhere other than the uterus, it almost invariably results in a rupture of
the structure and hemorrhage, which can be fatal. Ectopic pregnancies
always require medical or surgical removal.
126
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Partially blocking tubes are bad too
Sometimes endometriosis doesn’t block the tube altogether; it may create a
hydrosalpinx (a chronically dilated, swollen tube). See Figure 7-2.
The hydrosalpinx can fill with fluid that is toxic to embryos. (The fluid is a
result of endometriosis’s inflammatory process and is full of endotoxins, that
is, inflammatory proteins, white blood cells, and other harmful substances.)
If the end of the tube that connects with the uterus is open, even a little, the
fluid from the tubes can drip down into the uterus. (See Chapter 2 for more
about hydrosalpinx.)
This toxic fluid makes embryo implantation difficult, even if an embryo does
reach the uterus. Even if the embryo does implant, this poisonous fluid can
increase the risk of miscarriage. (Check out “Miscarriage and Endometriosis:
Is There a Connection?” later in this chapter.)

Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Because these fluid-filled tubes aren’t likely to be useful for getting pregnant,
your doctor may recommend removing them altogether. Of course, your only
option to get pregnant at that point is IVF — or a miracle.
Diagnosing Infertility Caused 
by Endometriosis
Infertility for any reason can make the road to pregnancy rocky — emotion-
ally, physically, and financially. Before embarking on that road, you want to
know all you can about the landmines along the way. Finding the right person
to help you is your first step.
This section first identifies the importance of seeing a specialist in order to
get a correct diagnosis (see Chapter 9 for more on tests used to diagnose
endometriosis). This section also looks at the different tests you may
undergo in order to reach a diagnosis of infertility.
Seeing an infertility specialist
If you haven’t become pregnant within a reasonable time (see the sidebar,
“How long should I try to get pregnant on my own?” in this chapter to find out
what a reasonable time is), you need to make an appointment with a doctor.
Most people start with their gynecologist (GYN) or their family doctor.

Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Is it absolutely necessary to see a specialist? That depends on your age,
degree of endometriosis, pregnancy history, and personal preference. (Many
women under the age of 45 don’t have a GYN, although they should.) Some
women want to go right to the big guns — the specialist. Even though con-
sulting with a specialist may not be necessary, this decision may help a
woman feel like she’s doing all she can. If you feel this way, by all means, see
a specialist.
Your GYN may be able to help you with the initial diagnosis and treatment.
(See Chapter 8 for tips on finding a doctor you can work with.) No matter
what type of doctor you decide to see, she’ll most likely suggest doing some
diagnostic tests. The following sections describe these diagnostic tests
(some overlap with tests in Chapter 9, but the tests in this chapter measure
infertility). Although some of the tests may be simple blood tests or imaging
studies, like ultrasounds or fluoroscopy, other tests are more invasive and
uncomfortable. But all of them help ascertain the reason for infertility and
guide your doctor toward the most direct treatment and the shortest road to
a pregnancy.
Drawing and testing blood
Nobody likes to have blood tests. (But usually men are the ones who turn
pale and fall over.) Your family physician or GYN may suggest some blood
work early in your treatment. Or, she may defer to a specialist and only do
Pap smears and cultures.
However, one of your doctors should look for clues in your blood. You doctor
may order a blood test that checks for the following:
 Elevated sedimentation rates, which indicate infection or inflammation
 Ca-125, a protein, which possibly comes from endometriosis
 Abnormal thyroid results, which may lead to a search for related, possi-
bly autoimmune, problems, such as endometriosis
 A mature egg and progesterone via estradiol and progesterone testing
at various times of the cycle
 Ovaries damaged from endometriosis and your ovarian reserve via an
FSH and estradiol draw early in your cycle
 Luteinizing (producing progesterone as a result of changes in the folli-
cle cells) too early or indications of LUF via LH and progesterone test-
ing (see “Checking out other hormonal problems: Luteal phase defect” in
this chapter)
129
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Whatever the findings of your tests, blood work is a mainstay of fertility diag-
nosis and treatment. Your doctor will order repeat tests until she’s sure your
treatments are appropriate for your problem.
Debating the endometrial biopsy
An endometrial biopsy can be an uncomfortable but easy test. The doctor
slides a small tube through the cervix that, by gentle suction or scraping,
removes a small piece of the endometrium. This test takes place near the end
of your menstrual cycle to see whether your endometrial lining has devel-
oped normally.
Abnormalities can suggest a luteal phase defect or other rarer problems. The
value of endometrial biopsies remains controversial, so some doctors no
longer do this test. But, because the debate continues, listen to your doctor’s
recommendations. (Check out Chapter 9 for more on biopsies.)
Having a hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
Don’t let this long medical word scare you away from this test. This mouthful
of letters refers to an X-ray test of your uterus and fallopian tubes with dye
injected into your uterus. If the dye exits the top of the fallopian tubes, the
tubes are open (see Figure 7-3). However, your tubes may not be blocked
even if the dye doesn’t spill out — sometimes the tubes can go into a spasm
from the dye and only appear to be blocked.
If the uterus contains fibroids, adhesions, polyps, or anything else that
shouldn’t be there, the dye can’t go to those spots, so they’re visible on the
X-ray. In addition, a tube with hydrosalpinx will appear dilated and swollen.
The HSG, however, can’t evaluate your ovaries or other parts of your pelvis
and can’t see adhesions or endometriosis.
130
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

If your doctor orders an HSG, you can expect the following to happen:
1. You lie down on an exam table in the lithotomy position (legs up in
stirrups).
2. Your doctor places a speculum in your vagina.
3. Your doctor gently cleans your cervix with betadine or another sterile
solution.
4. Your doctor places a cannula (a small tube) in the opening of the
cervix to inject the dye into the uterus.

Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

The dye may have an iodine base, so if you’re allergic to iodine, you
should avoid this test; your doctor may perform a sonohysterogram in its
place (see the next section).
5. Your doctor injects the dye and takes a photograph that shows the out-
line of the uterus and the fallopian tubes, including the spill of the
dye into the pelvis if the tubes are open.
Schedule an HSG after your period has ended but before you ovulate to avoid
interfering with a possible pregnancy. HSG takes 30 to 60 minutes and is an
outpatient procedure, usually without any anesthetic. HSGs generally take
place in a surgery center or in the hospital.
Your doctor may recommend you take an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, an hour
before the procedure because cramping during and immediately after the HSG
is normal. You may also have a small amount of bleeding for a day or two, but
report any heavy bleeding, fever, or extreme weakness to your doctor right
away. Infection is the main complication of HSG, but it occurs in less than 1
percent of cases. You can go back to your normal activities after an HSG,
although some doctors recommend avoiding sex for a few days afterward.
Opting for a sonohysterogram
Your doctor may choose a sonohysterogram or saline infusion sonohystero-
gram (SIS — an ultrasound that tracks normal saline that is injected into the
uterus) over an HSG (if you’re allergic to iodine dye, these are safer).
Sonohysterograms may not give enough information about the fallopian
tubes, but they’re excellent for diagnosing problems in the uterus. If your
doctor has scheduled a laparoscopy (check Chapter 11 for more info), the SIS
may be all you need. You may have this test in your doctor’s office, and side
effects are similar to those for the HSG.
Doing a hysteroscopy
If your doctor wants to look directly into your uterus, he may suggest a hys-
teroscopy. Many doctors can perform these in their office. In this procedure,
the doctor passes a small telescope through the cervix. Your uterus is dis-
tended with saline or carbon dioxide so that the entire uterus is clearly visi-
ble. You may have a local anesthetic and a sedative, such as valium, for the
procedure.
If the doctor sees adhesions or other problems, she may be able to remove
them with small instruments that she inserts through the scope. For more
extensive work, you’ll need to go to a hospital.

Probing with ultrasounds
Doctors use pelvic ultrasounds to evaluate infertility. Ultrasound, which uses
sound waves to bounce off internal structures, can be vaginal or abdominal
to evaluate the pelvis and observe the following structures:
 Ovarian cysts (and follicle size)
 Endometriomas
 Paratubal cysts (benign, fluid-filled remnants from fetal development)
 Dilated tubes (hydrosalpinx)
 Fibroids (common, benign tumors in the uterus)
 Other uterine abnormalities
 Other pelvic pathology (for example, a pelvic kidney)
Starting with Simple Treatments
After conducting the appropriate diagnostic tests (see the preceding sec-
tion), you doctor can determine what is causing your infertility.
The good news: Infertility caused by endometriosis is treatable.
If you have mild, Stage I or Stage II endometriosis, you may not need to jump
right into the big guns of infertility treatment, such as IVF. Most fertility
experts recommend treating infertility from mild endometriosis as if it were
unexplained. In other words, start with treatments that don’t require you to
remortgage your house. This section looks at some of the simple treatments
available.
Ovulation Induction (OI)
If you’re not ovulating at all, your doctor may suggest ovulation induction
(OI) to get you to produce an egg. If you’re already ovulating but not getting
pregnant, he may suggest OI to produce more than one egg, on the theory
that producing more than one egg is more likely to result in pregnancy.
133
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Ovulation induction (OI) can do the following:
 Increase your chance of developing one or more viable egg
 Help insure that a mature egg will ovulate
 Help cure a luteal phase defect or LUF (For more information on these
two conditions, check out “Checking out other hormonal problems:
Luteal phase defect” and “Looking at luteinized unruptured follicle syn-
drome [LUF]” earlier in this chapter.)
Some doctors prescribe medications to help egg development. Clomiphene
citrate (Clomid) may be the first drug your doctor recommends for OI
because it’s
 Cheap
 Taken by mouth
 Has fewer side effects than injected medications
Clomid has some negative effects; it can decrease cervical mucus and inter-
fere with your uterine lining. These adverse effects (a Catch-22 where the
treatment to help may hurt) aren’t common, but they can decrease the
chance for pregnancy. If these problems arise, your doctor can bypass the
cervical mucous by putting the sperm into the uterus or have you take estro-
gen to make the mucous and lining better.
If Clomid doesn’t help you get pregnant within a few months, then your
doctor may recommend injectible hormones, FSH or LH, as the next step in
OI. You usually start these injections early in your menstrual cycle, as early
as Day 2 or 3, and continue them each day until a mature egg has developed.
Doctors often prescribe another injected hormone, human chorionic
gonadotropin, or HCG, to take after an egg has matured to be sure the egg
releases. This hormone is usually taken only one time.
A woman can use these medications until a good egg forms, and these treat-
ments don’t have the potential bad effects on cervical mucous and the
endometrium that Clomid can have. But nothing’s perfect; these injectible
medications are
 More potent than Clomid
 Not cheap; many times more expensive than Clomid
 Injected once or twice a day for several days
 Riskier for overstimulation and multiple births (twins or more!)
134
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)
Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) may help you get pregnant more easily by
putting the sperm a little closer to the egg. The journey for sperm is long and
arduous, and sperm aren’t particularly bright. Only 50 percent of a good
sperm sample knows how to swim forward. Most sperm in any sample are
imperfect and have serious problems; they may
 Lack tails
 Swim in circles
 Have funny-shaped heads
 Not ask for directions (typical male trait!)
 Not be able to take a joke
IUI may offer an advantage in infertility because it weeds out the poorer
sperm and, ideally, puts only the best swimmers much closer to the target.
With any luck, all the bad stuff around the tubes and ovary (endotoxins,
white blood cells, and the like) won’t affect these macho sperm.
IUI often takes place in conjunction with OI or controlled ovarian hyperstimula-
tion. (See “What’s involved with IVF?” later in this chapter for more informa-
tion on this treatment.) Egg-stimulating medications help multiple eggs to
 Grow and stimulate an egg to mature properly
 Overcome some of the negative effects that endometriosis has on egg
development
Progesterone supplements
Progesterone therapy is another simple treatment that may help you achieve
pregnancy. Because a lack of adequate progesterone can cause infertility in
several ways, including luteal phase defect, your doctor may recommend addi-
tional progesterone after ovulation to be sure your levels are sufficiently high.
Your doctor may give you progesterone after you ovulate on an OI or IUI
cycle. Though exact dosage depends on the situation, too much progesterone
doesn’t seem to cause problems. You may take progesterone as a supposi-
tory, injections (ouch!), or caplet.
Be careful — not all progestogens are progesterone. Only the real progesterone —
like your ovaries make — is safe in pregnancy. Other progestogens (like Provera,
Agystin, and the like) may increase the risk of birth defects.

Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Taking the Next Step: Surgery 
to Treat Infertility
If patience or medical therapy hasn’t helped to get you pregnant and if male
problems have been eliminated, you may want to consider surgery.
Fortunately, surgery is much easier and safer today than it was a couple of
decades ago, even safer than a few years ago because of advances in anesthe-
sia and tremendous development in technology and instrumentation for mini-
mally invasive surgery.
Your doctor may suggest surgery to help you get pregnant because
 You’ve had no success with simple treatments.
 You’ve had long-standing, unexplained infertility.
 You’re older than 35, more so if you’re older than 40.
 Your doctor strongly suspects endometriosis.
 Other factors, like pelvic inflammatory disease, blocked tubes, fibroids,
and adhesions may be present (suggested by your history or tests).
The vast majority of women can have outpatient surgery, although some
cases require a hospital stay, especially if extensive adhesions, bowel involve-
ment, or previous surgeries indicate a greater risk. Discuss the risks and ben-
efits of any surgery with your doctor.
This section looks at the different surgical options to help you get pregnant.
You can also check out Chapter 11, which gives you much more in-depth info
about your surgical options and removing your endometriosis.
136
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Considering alternative treatments for infertility
Many of the same methods for overcoming the
pain of endometriosis (see Chapter 12) may be
used to help you get pregnant. Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) using herbs or
acupuncture have been utilized by many
women, although success rates are hard to
verify. Several years ago, the medical journal
Fertility and Sterility published an article sug-
gesting that acupuncture could improve preg-
nancy rates when used in conjunction with IVF.
(See Chapter 12 for more on choosing an
acupuncturist.)

Removing adhesions
A surgeon can remove adhesions caused by endometriosis, but one result of
this surgery is — you guessed it — more adhesions. Between 60 and 90 per-
cent of surgeries create more adhesions. What to do!?
If your surgery is primarily for infertility, your surgeon may need to disregard
your other symptoms to maximize your potential for achieving a pregnancy.
As a result, he may ignore adhesions that don’t directly affect your chance at
pregnancy.
For example, if your large intestine sticks to your pelvic wall and you have
some pain there (but not enough to drive you crazy) or if you have some mild
symptoms with bowel movements, your doctor may leave the adhesions
alone. Why? Because the risk of bleeding, tearing the intestine open, injuring
other vital organs, or creating more adhesions that will affect your shot at
pregnancy may be too great. Sometimes — even many times — prudence is
better than attempted heroics.
In light of this information, why does any woman have surgery for adhesions?
Some of the best reasons are
 The most common places for endometriosis to develop are on the tubes
and ovaries.
 Adhesions around these important structures hinder fertility, so remov-
ing this scar tissue can increase the chance of pregnancy.
 Freeing up the ovaries from dense adhesions can also increase the
chances of pregnancy with IVF.
You’re most likely to get pregnant in the first six months after surgery to
remove adhesions. The longer the time after surgery, the greater the chance
for adhesions to start forming again.
Taking out endometrial implants or not?
Removing endometrial growths may improve your chance for pregnancy.
Success may depend on their location, but implants around the tubes and
ovaries (and possibly anywhere) can affect fertility. Most experts agree, how-
ever, that surgeons should remove an endometrioma found during surgery
because it can compress and destroy ovarian tissue. These cysts may also
137
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

 Interfere with development of a follicle
 Contribute to an inaccurate ultrasound reading because the cyst looks
like a developing follicle
 Hinder normal follicular rupture
 Prevent egg pick-up by the fimbriae and tube
But, deciding what to do with endometriosis implants on other organs can be
more challenging. Removing or destroying the implants when the surgeon
finds them makes perfect sense. But, by doing so the surgeon may actually do
more harm than good. Experts have not been able to prove that removing
endometriosis from another organ, say the bladder, has any effect on fertility.
Pain, yes — infertility, no.
In fact, removing endometriosis lesions from areas other than the tubes or
ovaries may cause more scar tissue and adhesions that can lead to more
problems, especially when these structures had no adhesions to begin with.
These adhesions from the surgery can then interfere with sperm, egg, and
embryo transport.
So, what about the other effects of endometriosis on fertility, such as ovulation
problems, immune issues, and the like? Does surgery to remove endometriosis
improve these conditions when the disease isn’t on the ovary or tube? Well,
who knows! Two problems with its removal are
 Surgeons can’t see all the endometriosis because microscopic disease
undoubtedly remains.
 Microscopic early disease, Stage I or II, is very active metabolically and can
still disrupt fertility in these same ways as the removed endometriosis did.
So the question remains: Remove all visible endometriosis or not? Again, dis-
cuss this with your doctor to get his opinion.
Other than endometriomas (which most doctors agree should be removed),
the treatment of endometriosis on the surface of the ovary is problematical.
If endometriosis covers extensive areas of the ovarian surface, surgery may
cause more damage by destroying primordial follicles along with the lesions.
Removing adhesions doesn’t damage the surface of the ovary. But removing
or destroying implants on the surface may involve
 Extreme heat (cautery and some types of laser)
 Vaporization (laser)
 Coagulation of proteins
138
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

All these forms of energy can harm normal ovarian tissue. Even when remov-
ing adhesions with a scalpel or scissor, the surgeon must remove a margin of
normal tissue to insure no endometrial tissue remains.
All these methods diminish active ovarian tissue and can reduce the number
of primordial follicles (the finite number of eggs) in the ovary. This reduction,
of course, can lead to infertility itself — not a good idea when you’re trying to
solve the problem! So doctors are in a quandary with no consensus about the
proper procedure.
Going for the Big Guns: Is In Vitro
Fertilization (IVF) Necessary?
If your fallopian tubes are completely blocked, in vitro fertilization (IVF — the
removal of eggs from your ovaries by a surgical procedure and fertilizing
them with sperm in a Petri dish and then putting the embryos into the
uterus) is not only the best way to become pregnant, it’s the only way. (For
much more information on getting pregnant with IVF, check out Fertility For
Dummies by Jackie Meyers-Thompson and Sharon Perkins [Wiley].)
And if the tubes have partial closure, the risk of ectopic pregnancy also
makes IVF the best way to go. Note: In some cases of severe endometriosis,
the tubes may be open but the rest of the anatomy is so distorted that preg-
nancy may never happen without IVF.
If mild endometriosis seems to be your only problem and you’ve tried and
tried to become pregnant but haven’t been successful, your doctor may tell
you IVF is the next step. Even though the exact reason for infertility isn’t
clear in this case, IVF may be the only way to achieve your goal.
Two unique advantages to IVF are
 It may also help overcome poor egg quality by stimulating more than
one follicle to grow to maturity.
 Removing eggs from their follicles when they mature means that you’re
bypassing possible problems of LUF. (See the earlier section “Looking at
luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome [LUF]” for more about LUF.)
This section looks more closely at IVF, how it helps you get pregnant, and its
advantages and disadvantages so you can determine whether you want to
take this step.
139
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

What’s involved with IVF?
IVF is a complex process that can eat up your time, money, and sanity! Before
you lose any of the three, you may want to know what IVF involves.
IVF includes the following steps:
1. Stimulation of your ovaries with high-powered hormonal drugs to help
you produce more than one egg.
2. Removal of eggs directly from ovarian follicles through a minor proce-
dure.
3. Fertilization with sperm in a laboratory.
4. Implantation of embryos into your uterus through the cervix, bypass-
ing the fallopian tubes altogether.
IVF also involves ovarian hyperstimulation, that is, you take drugs (primarily
through an injection) that stimulate your body to produce more eggs than
normal.
How does IVF bypass the problems 
of endometriosis?
No one does IVF for fun; your doctor will only suggest it if he thinks it will
help overcome your fertility problems. IVF bypasses several of the inhibiting
factors of endometriosis. For example, it
 Removes eggs from their follicles and bypasses the problems of LUF,
adhesions, and scar tissue around the ovary
 Stimulates the ovaries until the eggs are mature (eliminating the effect of
endometriosis on maturation)
 Protects the eggs from the potentially toxic peritoneal fluid
 Allows manipulation of the endometrial lining to assure maturity for
implantation
 Fertilizes the eggs in the laboratory, decreasing the chance of sperm
damage from toxins in the tubes
 Bypasses the fallopian tubes for embryo transport, placing embryos
directly into the uterus
140
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

What’s the downside of IVF?
So, you’re thinking IVF is the perfect way to get pregnant, right?
Unfortunately, IVF isn’t a bed of roses leading you to dirty diapers, empty
bottles, and bundles of joy. You do need to consider the following cons before
deciding if IVF is right for you:
 Cost: IVF is very expensive, and not all insurance companies cover the
cost.
 No guarantee of success: Your chances of pregnancy may be 50 percent
or less.
 Emotional strain: Undergoing IVF can be stressful and frustrating, par-
ticularly if you have to do more than one cycle.
 Time consuming: Frequent doctor’s visits and tests can take a tremen-
dous amount of time away from work and family.
 Possible ethical and religious questions: Many people have ethical con-
cerns about the manipulation of eggs and sperm in a laboratory.
The bottom line on IVF is that some women can’t get pregnant without it. If
you’re one of them, it’s worth every penny and all the emotional turmoil.
Unfortunately, not even IVF can get everyone pregnant, which can be devas-
tating after such a huge emotional and financial outlay.
Miscarriage and Endometriosis: Is There
a Connection?
Experts continue to debate whether endometriosis increases the risk of mis-
carriage after you become pregnant. Many pregnancies end in miscarriage
before women even realize they’re pregnant. Sometimes a period that’s espe-
cially heavy or arrives a day or two late is actually a very early miscarriage
(sometimes called a chemical pregnancy).
Endometriosis may cause miscarriage by interfering with the chemical sup-
port necessary to maintain pregnancy by
 Lowering progesterone levels or increasing prolactin levels.
 Creating the immune issues that many women with endometriosis face.
141
Chapter 7: Endometriosis and Infertility: Having a Baby (Or Trying To)

Women who don’t have endometriosis but do have an autoimmune disease
(like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) also have an increased risk of miscarriage
and failed implantation. So, given the possible association of the immune
system and endometriosis, it’s understandable that women with endometrio-
sis are also more likely to have a miscarriage.
Likewise, if you believe the molecular genetic explanation of endometriosis
(see Chapter 4), then this defect may make it more difficult for an embryo to
implant or continue to grow. These abnormalities can affect receptors and
other factors that make implantation and continued development possible.
The embryo and endometrium may not work well together. Either way, this
defect can also explain the increased risk of miscarriage.
The following facts about miscarriage may surprise you:
 More than 50 percent of all embryos stop growing before they develop a
heartbeat.
 One in four women has a miscarriage in her lifetime.
 Eighty percent of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
 A chromosomally abnormal embryo causes at least 50 percent of all 
miscarriages.
Of course, knowing these facts does nothing to ease the pain and heartache
of miscarriage. Some studies have shown, however, that the treatment of
endometriosis does reduce miscarriage rates in women with endometriosis.

Finding the Right Doctor
In This Chapter
 Searching for a gynecologist
 Patiently taking your role
 Selecting the best doctor for you
 Leaving a not-so-perfect doctor
F
inding a doctor you love these days isn’t easy. For starters, your doctor
has to be conveniently located, unless you’re prepared to spend large
chunks of time (not to mention gas money) driving back and forth to appoint-
ments. Second, he has to have privileges at a hospital that’s acceptable to you.
Third, he needs to be taking new patients. Last of all (but certainly not least),
your doctor has to be in your insurance network, unless you’re independently
wealthy. No wonder so many women don’t even have a gynecologist!
In this chapter, we talk about how to find a competent doctor, how to avoid
doctors who never heard of the Hippocratic Oath, which states, “First, do no
harm,” and how to establish a good working relationship with your doctor.
Finally, we show you how to gracefully part ways from a doctor, if the need
arises.
Finding a Gynecologist
When I (coauthor Sharon) first started working in an infertility clinic, I was
amazed at how many women didn’t have a regular gynecologist (or GYN — a
specialist in women’s health issues). Some GYNs are also obstetricians, or
OBs — doctors who deliver babies. (See the sidebar “Gynecologist or obste-
trician: What’s the difference?” in this chapter.) Some women had their family
practice doctor do Pap smears and breast exams, which can be just fine, but
many women weren’t having any screenings. They didn’t want their family
doctor to do the tests, and they didn’t have a GYN, so these women were
skipping a crucial part of their health care. But these same women were
coming to our clinic to find out why they weren’t getting pregnant.

144
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Are you a woman who doesn’t have a GYN? Have you considered seeing one
but just didn’t know where to start? Or are you wondering why you really
need to see a gynecologist? If you suspect you have a health problem related
to your reproductive organs, the best person to see is a gynecologist, because
they have extensive training in diagnosing and treating women’s disease.
This section can help you by showing you how to look for a gynecologist
appropriate for you, how to narrow the search, and what to expect from your
first appointment.
Looking for the right doc
You may think some women don’t have routine GYN checkups because they
lack the health coverage. However, most health insurance plans cover at
least one yearly visit to the gynecologist. And even if a woman has no health
insurance, some clinics charge fees on a sliding scale. So really, the insurance
issue isn’t a good excuse for not having a gynecologist.
If you know — or suspect — that you have endometriosis, finding the right
GYN becomes even more complicated. Now you need a GYN that specializes
in endometriosis. You may think that all GYNS would be competent to treat
endometriosis, and for basic treatment of endometriosis, they probably are.
But some GYNs are especially interested in one area of women’s health more
than another, and specialize in it. GYNs with a special interest in endometrio-
sis are most likely to have kept up with the latest surgical techniques and
advances in endometriosis.
Overcoming the fear factors
Most women don’t avoid the GYN altogether;
only 3 percent of the women in one large study
said they’d never been to the gynecologist.
However, although 75 percent had yearly
exams, another 20 percent saw their gynecolo-
gist only every two to five years.
Why do women avoid the gynecologist?
 Fear of the exam itself
 Embarrassment — many women avoid
going to a GYN, for example, if they’re over-
weight
 Fear of what the doctor may find
It’s your doctor’s job to help you solve health
problems, not to make you feel more uncomfort-
able about them, so if you’re avoiding the GYN
because you’re afraid she’s going to yell at you
for something, it may be time to change GYNs!

But what’s the best way to find a gynecologist who specializes in endometrio-
sis? You can look to the following for a recommendation:
 Your insurance company: If your insurance company issued you a large
book with doctors who participate in its plan, you probably need to
start there, unless you’re willing to pay extra to see the doctor of your
choice.
 A nurse: You can check with a nurse who works in that specialty at the
hospital where you want to go for treatment. She may not tell you who is
a bad GYN — but she may tell you who she goes to!
 Your family doctor: Asking your doctor may be a good starting point for
finding a GYN, but you need to take this information with a grain of salt.
Doctors tend to recommend other doctors they know maybe because
they went to medical school together, or they’re on the same medical
staff, or they go to the same health club. Your doctor’s golf buddy isn’t
necessarily the best choice for you.
 Your current gynecologist: You may already have a gynecologist, so you
can ask her for a referral to a specialist who deals with endometriosis
issues. She probably knows and can suggest other doctors in the field.
But what if your gynecologist is hesitant to refer you to another physi-
cian for care? She may feel that she knows everything about your prob-
lem and that you don’t need another opinion. Or perhaps you’re not
comfortable with the way she’s handling your problem with endometrio-
sis (or other concerns). If she refuses to give a referral, ask her why. She
may not refer you to someone because she doesn’t know of anyone
within a reasonable distance, especially if you live in a rural area. In that
case, ask your primary care physician (PCP) or refer to Web sites dedi-
cated to endometriosis (check out Appendix B for some Web sites).
 Your friends and family: Your friends and family can recommend a new
GYN, but try to remain objective. Not all patients really know how to judge
whether or not a doctor is good. Your friends may base their perceptions
on whether the doctor treated them kindly, listened to them, and best of
all, cured them. But, even though all these qualifications are important,
they don’t really define a good doctor. Some people can’t be cured, and
people’s perceptions of good treatment may vary considerably.
 The phone book: Despite the ease and one-stop-shopping convenience
of the phone book, letting your fingers do the walking isn’t the best way
to find a GYN — or any other doctor, for that matter. Nonetheless, you
can find GYNs in any phone book under “Obstetricians and
Gynecologists” or “Women’s Health Center.”
If you’re still not able to find a referral in your general location, then you
may have to stick with your doctor and work together, or you may have
to travel some distance for care. But, when you do get a referral (and we
hope this process has been painless for you and your present doctor),
you still want to do some of your own research. Just because your PCP
or GYN refers a specialist, she still may not be the best for you.
145
Chapter 8: Finding the Right Doctor

Narrowing your search
To make good choices as you look for possible GYNs, you want to find a
doctor that meets your specific needs and other criteria. This checklist may
help you narrow your search for the gynecologist of your dreams:
❑Do you want to see a man or a woman GYN? Many women have strong
preferences for one or the other. If you’re more comfortable with a
woman, or a man, focus your search in that direction.
❑Is the doctor board-certified in gynecology? Board certification assures
that the doctor has met certain standards and maintains certification by
keeping up with new information. Doctors who are just out of school
may be listed as board eligible. This classification means they have the
education and are working toward the certification exam, which requires
doctors to have a certain number of surgeries under their belts. You can
find out if a doctor is board certified by asking whoever answers the
office phone; if that person doesn’t know, ask him or her to look at the
doctor’s certificates hanging on the walls! You can also look on
www.acog.org for board-certified doctors.
❑Is the doctor an MD (Medical Doctor) or a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy)?
(You can notice this distinction by the initials after the doctor’s name.)
These two routes through medical school used to be quite different, with
the DO putting more emphasis on holistic medicine and manipulation of
the spine to cure disease, but today the programs are very similar.
146
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Gynecologist or obstetrician? 
What’s the difference?
You may wonder why some doctors have the
title of gynecologist and some are obstetricians;
this distinction is mostly about the focus of their
practices. All board-certified obstetrician/gyne-
cologists have been residency trained and then
tested to practice in both fields. Some doctors
with the specialization focus on obstetrics —
delivering babies. If you’re considering becom-
ing pregnant in the future, you may want to
select a gynecologist who also does obstetrics,
so you don’t have to start the whole search
again if you become pregnant.
But some specialists don’t want the uncertain
hours of obstetrics, the risk of lawsuits, and the
high malpractice costs, so they decide to keep
their focus on gynecology.
Some gynecologists narrow their focus even
more, choosing to treat mostly patients for infer-
tility or for issues related to urology (study of the
urinary tract). However, these doctors may also
see general gynecology patients.

❑How far do you want to travel? Having a chronic disease like
endometriosis may mean frequent visits to the office. Although you’re
willing to travel an hour or more to see a specialist once, are you willing
to make this trip on a weekly or monthly basis?
❑Do you care where the GYN has hospital privileges? Doctors can’t just
walk into the nearest hospital and start performing surgeries; they have
to be on staff at that hospital. If you have strong preferences about local
hospitals, make sure your GYN is on staff where you want to go. Most
hospital Web sites have a list of doctors on staff, or you can ask the
person who answers the phone at the office where the doctor practices.
Scheduling your first appointment
After you narrow down your list of choices (if you live in a rural area, your
list may be one name long), you can call the doctor’s office to find out the 
following:
 Is the GYN taking new patients?
 Does she still take your insurance? (Doctors start and stop taking insur-
ances at regular intervals.)
 How far out are the new patient appointments? (The office may be
scheduling months in advance.)
Calling an office can be very illuminating. For example, you can get a good idea
of how you’d be treated as a patient by the office phone etiquette. Is the person
who answers your call abrupt, putting you on hold without even asking if it’s
okay? Or does she ask the question, but then not listen to the answer? Can you
even reach a live person, or do you get a maze of recordings that tell you to
“Press 1, press 2, press 7 . . .” until you forget what you called for?
Prepping for the call
Before you actually call the doctor, prepare yourself. Make sure you have all
the important information before you pick up the phone so you don’t have to
run into the other room for more documents.
The following tips can help you prepare for phoning a doctor’s office:
 Have your insurance card ready so you can give the correct informa-
tion. “It’s a blue card . . . blue something” isn’t very helpful in determin-
ing whether that office takes your insurance.
 Have your appointment book out. You’re calling for an appointment, so
have your calendar handy when the scheduler gives you times and
dates.
147
Chapter 8: Finding the Right Doctor

 Know the reason for your appointment. Different appointments may
require different time slots. For example, a first appointment may take
more schedule time than a surgical follow-up.
Making the call
You can help your first contact by being a good potential patient. If you’re
ready to make the call, remember the following pointers when talking to the
scheduler:
 Call at a time when you can pay attention to the conversation. In other
words, don’t call when you’re driving, trying to make dinner, or working
where you may have many interruptions.
 Ask how long you can expect to be at the office, especially for a new
patient appointment. Your potential doctor may want to do blood work,
ultrasounds, or other testing on your first visit. If you’re worrying about
picking up your son from school half an hour after your appointment
time, your stress level is probably going to rise considerably.
Note: Obviously, if you’re seeing more than one potential GYN, they all
can’t do testings like Pap smears or mammograms. Your insurance com-
pany won’t pay for more than one. You can make your first appointment
a “getting to know you” event, with more talk than action. (See Chapter 9
for more on what to expect during your first exam.)
 Ask what information you should bring with you. If you have your
medical history or any type of medical records, you can bring them with
you. But, unless you’re sure this is Doctor Right, don’t have all your
medical records transferred to him. Wait until you’re sure that you want
to work with this new doctor before asking another doctor to send
records — most offices charge you for this service.
 Tell the person you’re making the appointment with that you’re
making the appointment to get to know the doctor without making it
sound like you’re “doctor shopping.” Most docs appreciate that a com-
fortable patient-doctor relationship is important, but they also don’t
want to feel that they’re just one of a long list of docs that you’re trying
out. Saying, “I’d like to talk with Dr. Smith before she does an examina-
tion; is that possible?” sounds less harsh than “I want to talk with Dr.
Smith before I let her examine me.”
Navigating the First Doctor’s Visit
After you’ve pared your list down to one (or possibly a couple) doctors and
scheduled an appointment, you need to make sure you’re ready for your visit.
Your time is valuable — and so is your doctor’s — so make sure you’re all set.

During this visit, the doctor may conduct several tests (see Chapter 9 for
specifics on the actual exam). However, this section focuses more on what
you need to do.

Chapter 8: Finding the Right Doctor
Avoiding charlatans
In your search for your GYN, you may encounter
a few bad apples. Most doctors are profession-
als who take their jobs very seriously.
Unfortunately some doctors are out to make a
quick buck off the unsuspecting public. These
doctors fall into two basic categories:
 Doctors who know they’re fleecing the
public.
 Doctors who truly believe in what they’re
doing, even if no one else does.
You want to watch out for doctors whose treat-
ments are basically worthless and whose main
goal is a fatter bank account. These pros are
pretty easy to spot.
 They charge a lot of money for what they’re
peddling, whether it’s a book, a medication,
or a treatment.
 They claim to be the only one who knows
this secret. (If you found a miraculous cure,
would you keep it to yourself?)
 They tell you that everyone else has done
something wrong; no matter what it was, it
was not what they would have done.
 They treat people who are desperate.
(Would people be breaking down the doors
for a cure to dandruff?) These doctors
target people who have received no satis-
faction from conventional medicine.
Doctors who truly believe in what they’re doing
but are somewhat unconventional in their
approach are more difficult to deal with. For
example, they have no trouble sounding truly
sincere because they usually are. This attitude
makes them quite persuasive. And these doc-
tors may not charge much for their services, rel-
atively speaking, because they really want to
cure people and believe they have the answer.
Not all charlatans are medical doctors; they
may be naturopaths, herbalists, or someone
who just put a few initials behind his name and
made up a title to fit them. Often these charla-
tans have practices with lofty, impressive-
sounding names that, coincidentally, include the
name of another well-known institution. How do
you protect yourself from medical charlatans?
Remember these facts:
 If a remedy sounds too good to be true, it
probably is.
 If he has a true medical breakthrough, other
people know about it.
 Legitimate medical practitioners are open
to questioning and share new findings with
other doctors.
 The Better Business Bureau may have
complaints against institutions or clinics;
check it out.
 Ask your own doctors what they think, but
remember that they may pooh-pooh a
doctor who has legitimate, valid, but
unorthodox approaches.

Describing your symptoms
You can save the doctor’s time — and your own — if you can bring a coher-
ent list of symptoms. (See Chapter 2 for more on keeping track of your symp-
toms.) “What brings you here today?” is probably one of the most poorly
answered questions in any doctor’s office.
In order to prepare for this first visit, create a list that includes the following:
 What do you feel (severe pain, dull ache, and so forth)?
 Where do you feel pain (pelvis, right or left side, vagina, and so on)?
Draw a picture of yourself, with an X on the pain spots. If you have any
artistic ability at all, an illustration is a great way to help your doctor
understand.
 When do you have symptoms (time of the month, relation to your
period)?
 How long do your symptoms last?
 How often do your symptoms occur (regularly — every month, every
day, every minute — or irregularly)?
 How long have you had the symptoms (a year, since yesterday, your
whole life)?
In addition to your symptoms, create a list of how you’ve tried to deal with
the pain. If you’ve already tried every over-the-counter, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug on the shelves, write this information down. If another
doctor has tried hormone replacement therapy, note this treatment too. This
list saves time so your doctor can begin focusing on a more promising course
of treatment.
Interviewing your doctor
Now that you and Dr. Prospective are face to face (and hopefully you’re fully
clothed and talking across a desk, not wearing a paper gown and lying on a
table), it’s time to find out how compatible you are.
On your list of questions to ask, you should have the following:
 Do you treat many patients with endometriosis? (The answer should
be “Yes.”)
 How many patients with endometriosis do you see in a year? (The
more the better; a few or a dozen or so isn’t very many.)
150
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

 What kind of testing can you do to diagnose endometriosis? (There
aren’t many tests for endometriosis; surgery is the most definitive way
to identify it.)
 Do you do surgery often for endometriosis? (The answer should be
“Yes, when necessary.”)
If the doctor already has his prescription pad out and is writing on it before
you even have your coat off, he may not be the doctor for you. Treating a
chronic illness, such as endometriosis, is more than suppressing the symp-
toms, and rarely does a simple prescription cure your ills. Ordering medica-
tions isn’t wrong, as long as the doctor has heard the whole story first and
has a good idea of what he’s treating.
Making your final decision
At the end of your first visit, you’ll probably have a good idea of whether or
not this doc is a keeper. Has he
 Answered your questions thoroughly?
 Encouraged you to ask questions?
 Really listened to what you say without trying to rush the conversation?
 Made recommendations based on your symptoms and not a cookie-
cutter approach?
If you feel good about the visit and your personalities seem to mesh, you may
want to make the relationship permanent. If you’re comfortable that you’ve
made the right choice, you can start discussing specific testing and treat-
ments. You can schedule them for a later date, or get started the same day of
your get-acquainted visit.
Sometimes you know immediately that this doctor isn’t for you, and a brief
visit is enough before saying goodbye. Don’t feel bad about this decision; doc-
tors know they can’t please everyone.
Working with Your Doctor
After you’ve chosen a doctor, you need to do your part to keep the relation-
ship a beneficial one. Your doctor will best be able to help you if you commu-
nicate honestly and work together. In the next sections, we tell you how.
151
Chapter 8: Finding the Right Doctor

Communicating your concerns
You’re never going to be happy with your doctor unless you feel like he’s taking
your concerns seriously. But presenting those concerns in an organized,
straightforward manner can help him understand your specific situation.
What can you do if he doesn’t seem to take your symptoms seriously? You
need to find another doctor. But if you initially felt comfortable with this
doctor, you may want to try and salvage your relationship. To take another
stab at developing a good relationship, try the following:
 Restate your concerns. Maybe you weren’t clear. Try writing symptoms
down and reading them to him — or just hand him the list.
 Stay factual. Overstatement is okay when you’re telling a dramatic story
to your friends, but exaggeration usually gets poor results in the
doctor’s office.
 Be honest about your concerns. Many people were taught as children
not to complain. They carry that attitude into the doctor’s office, mini-
mizing their symptoms, so the poor doctor has a terrible time trying to
figure out what’s really wrong with them. Conversations that start with
“Tell me how you’ve been.” “Oh, not too bad, Doctor Perfect. How are
your kids doing?” aren’t going to help him find out what’s wrong with
you. A doctor’s office is no place to keep a stiff upper lip.
If he still isn’t taking your concerns seriously, then you may need to move on
to another doctor on your list.
Keeping your expectations realistic
Sometimes people expect too much of their doctors. Your doctor isn’t a
member of the holy family, nor does he keep a halo hidden under his bed.
He’s just a person like you — only with a medical degree and possibly a
house at the shore.
As much as you hope he can, your doctor can’t pull cures out of thin air or
make symptoms disappear with a few words. When you’re dealing with a
chronic disease, such as endometriosis, remember that the condition usually
requires some degree of trial and error with different medications and treat-
ments before you notice progress. Unfortunately, you’ll probably never be able
to say that your endometriosis is gone forever — at least not before menopause.
Blaming your doctor is easy if you’re not cured quickly. But you need to
remember one important point: Although endometriosis isn’t curable, it is
controllable in many cases. Look at endometriosis as a condition that you’ll
have to live with and deal with for some time, not as a disease that comes
once and goes away, like the measles.
152
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Divorcing Your Doctor Painlessly
As much as you respect and like your doctor, sometimes you need to break
off the relationship and say “Goodbye.” Maybe he’s not listening to you, or
he’s not helping you, or you’re just not comfortable with the progress of your
treatment.
Don’t worry too much about hurting your doctor’s feelings if you decide to
change practices, but do try and leave on good terms. When you’re ready to
move on, make sure you
 Get a copy of your treatment record. Instead of having your records
sent to a new doctor, get a copy for yourself. The copy may cost about a
dollar or two per page, but keeping your own records is a good idea. You
can make a copy for your next doctor.
 Say what you have to say in a letter. If you have had serious issues with
the practice that don’t relate specifically to the doctor, send a letter to
inform him. Maybe his front desk staff is alienating patients or his billing
staff is continually messing up on insurance issues. The doctor needs to
know about these problems. Of course, if the receptionist is his wife and
the billing person is his daughter, writing a letter probably won’t accom-
plish much, but the exercise can make you feel better.
153
Chapter 8: Finding the Right Doctor
Trusting your doctor
I (coauthor Sharon) have worked in doctors’
offices for ten years. I’ve seen far too many
people on both extremes — patients who would
jump off a bridge if their doctor told them to and
patients who acted like their doctor was trying
to kill them. Take my advice: If you’ve taken the
time to pick the right doctor, then trust him. I
don’t mean blind trust; ultimately, you’re the one
who has to live with his recommendations. Also,
try to avoid taking an adversarial stance with
your doctor.
Keeping up on all the latest research is difficult
unless you’re a doctor. So you don’t need to tell
your doctor about the groundbreaking treat-
ment that you read about in a well-known
women’s magazine. Most of the time, these
magazines have old, incomplete, or even faulty
information. Doctors generally hear about
promising research in medical journals long
before the news shows up at the supermarket
checkout counter. After you choose a doctor,
trust that he’s going to keep up on all the newest
treatments, that he has your best interests at
heart, and that he’s not trying to do you harm.

 Stick to your reasons for leaving. Don’t make accusations, such as “The
receptionist deliberately hung up on me!” unless you can prove it. And
stay away from threatening statements (even though your brother is a
lawyer).
 Be careful how you talk about your problems with a doctor’s office
with others. You may be talking within earshot of the receptionist’s best
friend or the doctor’s brother-in-law!
154
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 
Finding a doctor if you don’t have insurance
Unfortunately, many women who need medical
care don’t have medical insurance. The cost of
medical care, and especially hospitalization,
can be unbelievably high. If you’re uninsured,
we suggest you keep the following in mind
when considering medical care:
 If you’re married, see if your husband’s
insurance plan can include you.
 If you’re partnered and your partner’s com-
pany includes domestic partnership cover-
age, see if the plan can include you.
 If you’re working, see if you can purchase
insurance through your job.
 If you’re not working, see if you’re eligible
for Medicaid or Medicare.
 If you live in a large town, it probably has at
least one hospital clinic for the uninsured
and the underinsured. The hospital may
help you apply for an insurance program
that you’re eligible for, and the hospital may
have a sliding-scale fee plan based on your
income.
 If you live in a larger city, look for a medical
school or residency training program.
These teaching programs have enthusias-
tic, young doctors in training with close
supervision by senior staff physicians. The
clinics often have sliding-scale fee plans.
Although the wait is often longer, the level
of care is excellent.
 If you have to see a private physician and
don’t have insurance, make sure to mention
to her that you’re uninsured. Even if the
front office personnel are aware, the doctor
may not be. Many doctors reduce their fees
and give discounts to patients who pay for
their care at the time of service, so it never
hurts to ask. If the doctor is rude about the
issue, this is probably a good time to look for
a new doctor!

Chapter 9
Do You Have Endometriosis? Your
Initial Exam and Diagnosis
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect during the exam
 Communicating with your doctor
 Relying on diagnostic tests
 Taking a close look at endometriosis
 Classifying the stages of endometriosis
H
ow do you find out whether you have endometriosis? You may suspect
it, think that your symptoms match those in every book and on every
Internet support board, know that your mom and six sisters all have it — but
how do you know for sure? When you really want a diagnosis, you need to
talk with a doctor.
But how does a doctor know you have endometriosis? In many cases, this
disease isn’t easy to diagnose. In this chapter, we tell you about preparing for
your first diagnostic appointment, what occurs at that exam, and how you
can communicate most effectively. We also tell you what’s in your doctor’s
bag of tricks to properly diagnose endometriosis, including lab tests, imaging
techniques, and the granddaddy of diagnostic gold standards — a biopsy.
After you have a diagnosis, we tell you how the doctor analyzes your condi-
tion and what the different stages mean so you can understand how severe
your endometriosis is.
Preparing for Your Diagnostic Exam
Your appointment is tomorrow, but how can you prepare for the exam? This
section covers a few essentials that you need to do (and not do) before you
show up at your doctor’s office for your diagnostic exam.

Knowing what to do (and not do)
Before you arrive at your doctor’s office, you need to make sure you come
ready for the exam. Keep in mind the following important pointers:
 Don’t douche. Women seem to think they need to be clean and dainty
down there. But douching isn’t good for you because it increases the
chance of developing a pelvic infection. In addition, the doctor needs to
see the natural conditions down there. Take a shower, yes. Douche, no.
 Shave your legs and whatever else you normally shave. Shaving really
isn’t required, but if you forget, you’re going to look down and say, “I
can’t believe I forgot to shave.” You’ll be so embarrassed by your stub-
ble that you won’t hear a word the doctor says.
 Come to your appointment with a full bladder. The nurse will probably
hand you a little jar to urinate in (and going on command is hard
enough, but going when you just went is even harder!). If the nurse
hasn’t given you a jar and you need to urinate before your appointment,
let her know so you don’t waste a valuable sample and can complete the
ritual before you go into the exam room.
Should you bring your partner to this visit? That’s up to you and your part-
ner. Your partner may be able to
 Give you support.
 Add details that you forgot to mention.
 Give a different perspective.
 Provide a second pair of ears. (You may be nervous and forget details of
the discussion.)
Bringing information with you
Most important of all, bring your diary with you (see Chapter 2), the one with
all your symptoms. You started the diary for this appointment — to give your
doctor a concise and accurate description of your situation. So don’t leave
home without it.
If you have old records from other doctors, bring them along also. This step
is especially helpful if you’ve had previous treatments or surgery for
endometriosis. Past problems (medical, surgical, or gynecologic) and records
(testing, findings, and treatment) are very important to your healthcare
provider. Don’t trust your memory on this.
156
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

And don’t think that your appendectomy at age 5 isn’t relevant now. All med-
ical facts, no matter how trivial you may think they are, can help your doctor
figure out which disease may be causing your symptoms. Every bit of this
information can help your doctor decide on the diagnosis, testing, and treat-
ment to try.
Understanding How Your Doctor 
Makes a Diagnosis
So, you’re in your little paper gown and perched on the exam table when you
hear that shuffling at the door that means your doctor is about to appear. Or
maybe you’re sitting in the chair, trying to put off climbing on the table for
one more minute and in comes your doctor. He may sit and chat with you for
a few minutes to help you relax before insisting that you hop up on the table,
but eventually the time comes to get on up.
Many physicians have a nurse, assistant, student, or other doctor in the
room for the pelvic examination. If you feel uncomfortable with someone else
in the room during the exam, your doctor may allow her to leave at your
request. Or, if no one is in the room with you and your doctor and you’re
uncomfortable with this, tell him you want someone with you.
Don’t worry though. Your doctor knows his job. This section helps you
understand your doctor’s routine, including the general exam and the pelvic
exam. This section also addresses what you can do if you experience pain
during the pelvic exam.
The general exam
Because your gynecologist isn’t a general practitioner or internist, she may
not do a complete general exam. But she still should cover all the areas that
may relate to your gynecologic problems.
As you talk, your doctor is assessing your overall appearance in the following
ways:
 Are you over or underweight by a lot?
 Do you have excessive hair or an unusual pattern of hair growth or loss?
 What’s your general body type, and have you developed normally for
your age?
 Do you have unusual markings, rashes, or lesions of the skin?
157
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

Your doctor may also
 Check your lymph nodes and thyroid gland to be sure you have no
enlargements or other abnormalities.
 Examine your face, chest, and back for acne.
 Note color and temperature changes of the hands or feet.
 Note joint pain or tenderness.
 Listen to your heart, lungs, and abdomen with a stethoscope (just to be
sure you have no obvious problems).
 Examine your breasts for masses and leakage.
 Palpate your abdomen (explore with the hands) to find abnormal
masses.
 Check your back for muscle spasm or tenderness.
 Check your legs for varicose veins and swelling.
All this information is important and provides clues to your diagnosis. If a
detail seems different from the norm, your doctor may refer you to another
specialist or to your primary doctor, or she may order other tests.
The pelvic exam
Eventually you need to get into the lithotomy position, which is lying on your
back with your knees and hips flexed and thighs spread apart. Granted, it’s
not the most dignified position in the world, but your doctor can see what he
needs to see, and, remember, that’s what you came for. Usually the actual
pelvic exam is done after the rest of the general exam. The following shows
the different steps of a pelvic exam:
1. Your doctor visually and tactilely examines the vulva and the opening
of the vagina.
She looks at the skin for any rashes, color changes, lesions (such as
warts, ulcers, moles, or scars), abnormalities of the structures, or dis-
charge. She may then touch the skin to feel for firm or tender areas and
the pliability of the tissues. Doing so assures your doctor that other
problems (such as infections or structural abnormalities) aren’t causing
your problems.
2. Your doctor places the speculum into the vagina.
The speculum is a device that looks like a duck’s bill and holds the walls
of the vagina apart (gently, we hope, and warmed is even better) so the
doctor can see the inside of the vagina, its lining, and the cervix.
158
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

3. The doctor can take specimens by swab, brush, or spatula (no, not the
kind you flip hamburgers with!) from the vagina or cervix.
These swabs provide information for
Cervical problems (Pap smears)
Vaginal and cervical infections
Hormonal evaluations
Fertility testing
4. The doctor can take an endometrial or cervical biopsy (removal of a
small part of tissue).
You may have local anesthesia to make you more comfortable.
5. The doctor performs a bimanual (two hands) exam.
During this part of the exam, he places one hand on the lower abdomen
above the pubic bone and one or two fingers of the other hand into the
vagina until he reaches the cervix.
During this very important part of the exam, your doctor can:
• Feel lumps and irregularities of the tissues in the vagina and cervix
• Feel the uterus, ovaries, and any other masses in the pelvis by
placing the internal organs between his hands
• Detect fibroids (usually benign tumors of the uterus), ovarian cysts,
lesions, other pelvic masses, and irregularities of the pelvic organs
6. Your doctor may perform a rectal exam.
He places one gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum and another
finger in the vagina to help him feel any thickening in the area between
the rectum and uterus.
Because this area is a very common site for endometriosis, any nodules
or thickening of this area can strongly suggest endometriosis.
7. Your doctor can perform a test for blood in the stool after the rectal
exam.
See “Checking your stool for blood” in this chapter to see how your
doctor does this.
When your doctor has completed the entire exam, he may suggest more
tests, such as an ultrasound and blood tests, to help make a diagnosis.
159
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

Ouch! Tenderness during the exam
The pelvic exam shouldn’t be painful. It may be uncomfortable both mentally
and physically, but real pain is unusual and may mean that you have an
underlying problem. If you do have discomfort or pain, be sure to let your
doctor know. Everyone has a different pain threshold, so don’t worry about
looking like a wimp — don’t try to hide it and suck it up. Your doctor wants
to know what you’re feeling no matter how trivial you may think it is.
If you’re going to the gynecologist because you have pain, your provider may
try to duplicate it. For instance, if you have pain in a certain area of the pelvis
during sex, he may try to push in that area or move parts around to re-create
the pain. With these moves, he hopes to find the reason (a mass, nodule, or
fixed [unmoving] structure) for the pain.
If you’ve been having pain at home or if you experience pain during your rou-
tine exam, discuss this symptom with your doctor now. He may not have felt
or seen a problem during the exam, so telling him about the pain lets him
know that he needs to investigate further and, ideally, prevent future pain.
Keeping the Lines of 
Communication Open
Talking honestly and opening with your doctor can be difficult, but the more
medical information you give him, the better able he’ll be to diagnose your
problem. Some information that he needs to know may be embarrassing to
discuss, and some details may be very personal. Try to remember that he is a
doctor, and he’s heard it all (and more!) before.
Even if you don’t feel like being social during your exam, you still need to be
proactive. This is no time to be a dainty wallflower. This section tells you how
to talk to your doctor during the exam and how to get your doctor’s diag-
noses in writing for your own records.
Talking openly with your doctor
Talking to doctors is hard enough when you’re fully clothed and sitting in a
chair at eye level; it’s even harder when one of you — and it’s never the
doctor! — is wearing a paper gown and has her legs up in stirrups. Some doc-
tors choose this time to start small talk about your job, family, or whatever to
help you relax.
160
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Don’t feel like you have to carry on a full-fledged conversation; this isn’t a tea
party, and your doctor’s not grading you on your social skills. If you answer
in monosyllables, he’ll catch on that you don’t feel like talking during the
exam, or he may just carry on a monologue. If possible, talk with your doctor
only when you’re fully dressed and sitting across a desk from him. You’ll feel
more like an equal and probably retain more of his ideas. Besides, how are
you going to whip out your diary if you’re wearing a paper gown?
After your exam, if you feel like your doctor didn’t listen to you or that you
didn’t feel comfortable asking him certain questions, then you need another
doctor. You don’t need to settle for a doctor who acts as if you shouldn’t
bother your little head about medical details or talks down to you. Doctors,
for the most part, are aware of the plethora of information (and misinforma-
tion) on the Internet; they know that many patients have read obsessively
about their condition before they ever get into the office.
Your doctor should always give you chance to ask questions at the end of the
exam. Saying “Anything else bothering you?” as he walks out the door isn’t
good enough! A good doctor addresses all your concerns during your visit,
and she wants to be sure you understand your condition, so she may provide
written instructions or pamphlets for you to read.
Maintaining your own set of records
In this age of frequent moves and insurance changes, keeping your own
records is very helpful to you and your future medical practitioner. But you
don’t need to sneak your chart out of the office to photocopy it before anony-
mously returning it. You don’t need records of every detail.
Keeping your own records makes it easier to supply new doctors with infor-
mation if you need to change or add doctors due to insurance changes or
new diseases. But you don’t need to lock these records in Fort Knox. Keeping
them in a drawer where you can find them easily is fine. If they contain infor-
mation you don’t want anyone else to see, you may consider buying a safe.
Copies of all your tests or procedures and surgical reports are very handy. If
you ask for a copy of a procedure or test result on the day of your visit, most
doctors give it to you without a charge. If you call in and ask for a copy of
your chart, you may have to pay a dollar a page.
Undergoing a Few Diagnostic Tests
“We’re just going to run a few tests,” your doctor says, handing you a handful
of prescriptions just before he leaves the room. You look at the prescriptions
(which are, of course, illegible) and wonder, “What tests? Why? Where do I go
161
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

for them?” We hope your doctor is more communicative than this and actu-
ally explains the what, why, and where for you. But in case he doesn’t, this
section can help you make your appointments and tell you what to expect.
It’s a draw — blood, that is
Few blood tests help to diagnose endometriosis. In fact, no blood test can
prove or disprove the presence of endometriosis. So why is Nurse Ratchet
coming at you with a needle and an evil smile on her face?
Although endometriosis has no specific blood test, one called CA125 can be a
diagnostic tool because many women with endometriosis in the pelvic area
have an elevated CA125 level. An elevated CA125 level is the result of irrita-
tion of the peritoneal surface by the disease. However, other diseases, such
as fibroids or ovarian cancer, can also cause an elevated CA125, so the test
isn’t a reliable way to diagnose endometriosis by itself. In most labs, a normal
CA125 level is less than 35 U/ml (units per milliliter).
Current research is focusing on the diagnosis of endometriosis by cytokines
(see Chapter 4 for more on cytokines) that develop in response to the inflam-
mation of endometriosis. Down the road, scientists may identify specific gene
markers for endometriosis and then isolate those markers in a blood test.
If you’re trying to get pregnant, your doctor may use a blood draw to evalu-
ate your ovarian function by checking hormone levels such as estrogen, prog-
esterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). (See Chapter 7 for more
about hormone levels and fertility.)
Checking your stool for blood
A hemoccult or stool guaiac test checks for blood in your stools. If blood is
present, your doctor can order more specific tests to determine the source of
the blood. Endometriosis on the intestines can cause blood in your stools
during your period, so a positive test may suggest this problem.
Although it sounds fairly disgusting, the hemoccult isn’t painful and your
gynecologist may take a sample without your realizing it. He simply inserts a
gloved finger into the rectum to obtain a small amount of stool and smears it
on a special paper. Within a few seconds, the paper changes color to indicate
the presence of blood.
162
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Your cup runneth over: The urinalysis
Endometriosis on your bladder can cause abnormalities in your urine, so
your doctor may want to do a urinalysis, a test of your urine (see Chapter 6
for more on endometriosis in your bladder). Urinating into a cup isn’t all that
difficult, unless you’re klutzy or can’t aim. It can also be challenging if you
can’t urinate on demand. Our advice: Always go to your doctor’s appoint-
ments with a full bladder — that way you can minimize your anxiety and hap-
pily accommodate the request for a specimen.
A urinalysis can diagnose any number of conditions, from kidney and liver
problems to urinary tract infections. Most urinalysis tests check for the 
following:
 Bacteria
 Bilirubin (a chemical excreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder)
 Blood
 Ketones (chemicals that are products of tissue breakdown)
 Nitrates (chemicals that may signify bacterial growth)
 Protein
 Sugar
 White blood cells
Finding any of this stuff in urine is abnormal. Although urine is normally ster-
ile (hard to believe, isn’t it!), vaginal secretions and skin bacteria can contam-
inate it. A clean catch specimen (cleaning with a soapy cloth before urinating
and then discarding the first part) is important to avoid contamination.
Testing, testing: Ultrasounds, X-rays, 
CT scans, MRIs, and more
Have you ever wished you could just look inside your body and see what’s
giving you trouble? Although Superman’s X-ray vision was great, today’s
ultrasounds, X-rays, computed tomography-scan tests (CTs), and Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRIs) are the next best thing.
Undergoing ultrasound
Ultrasound can help your doctor diagnose distorted or swollen fallopian
tubes, endometriosis, other pelvic problems, and uterine anomalies.
Ultrasound bounces sound waves off internal organs or tissues, detecting 
163
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

differences in the density of various tissues. Your doctor can then see
whether organs are in the right location and have a normal density.
Two ways to do an ultrasound are
 Transabdominal: This is the most common and least invasive approach.
Doctors commonly use this ultrasound for obstetrics, but it can also
show fibroids, check the position of organs, and give fairly good informa-
tion on the uterus and other pelvic organs.
 Transvaginal: This approach uses a probe through the vagina up to the
cervix at the top of the vagina, where the abdominal cavity begins.
Because the ovaries should be in this location, a transvaginal ultrasound
offers a better view for various problems in the ovaries and tubes (espe-
cially for an ectopic pregnancy and endometriomas) and in the endome-
trial cavity.
Many times a doctor may ask for both kinds of ultrasounds to be sure he
doesn’t miss anything.
HSGs, SIS, X-rays, and CT scans
Your doctor may suggest a number of additional tests to get a better look at
your insides, particularly if you’re planning on trying to get pregnant. Some
of these tests are more effective than others in diagnosing endometriosis. He
may recommend the following tests:
 Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): In this test, dye is passed through the
uterus and the fallopian tubes. Your doctor can tell if your tubes are
blocked by adhesions or dilated by inflammation, as well as check for
uterine anomalies (see Chapter 7 for more on HSGs and how they’re
done).
 Saline Infusion Sonohysterogram (SIS): This test may be done to get a
better look at the structure of the uterus and endometrial cavity. The
procedure is done with a small tube placed into the uterus (like a very
thin catheter) so that saline can be infused into the endometrial cavity
while the ultrasound is completed.
 X-Ray: X-rays are useful for looking at bony structures and some soft
tissue, such as the lungs or parts of your abdomen. Unfortunately, an X-
ray only tells you whether you have a mass or obstruction in your lungs,
bladder, or bowel; it can’t diagnose whether the blockage is endometrio-
sis or some other kind of mass.
 CT scan: A computed tomography-scan (or CT), similar to X-rays, can
show masses and obstructions as well as cysts, but they can’t differenti-
ate between endometriosis and other types of masses. Because they
consist of multiple slices of the area, CT scans can give a more distinct
image of a body part. This increased resolution can be better than a
single, simple X-ray picture.
164
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs)
An MRI machine consists of a large tube that you slide into (or are slid into)
so that the specific body part is in the exact center of the magnetic field that
runs through the MRI. The tube is actually a big magnet. Your doctor can use
MRIs to diagnose endometriosis if the lesions are larger than 2 centimeters
(about 1 inch) and to diagnose endometriomas (cysts caused by endometrio-
sis). Check out Chapters 3 and 7 for more on endometriomas.
MRIs are very expensive compared to other diagnostic tests but may be
useful in distinguishing between certain abnormalities. Although the MRI
can’t see cysts well, this diagnostic test may help to rule out other problems,
such as fibroids or pelvic abnormalities. The MRI has not supplanted the gold
standard of a biopsy for endometriosis (refer to the next section).
So how do MRIs work? MRIs use magnets and radio waves to create images. A
computer creates the images by sending radio waves through your body and
collecting the signal that’s emitted from the hydrogen atoms in your cells. An
antenna collects this information and feeds it into a sophisticated computer
that produces the images. MRIs can show much greater detail in soft tissues
(they’re not so good with bones) than CT scans. MRIs can also scan from
many different angles, but CT scans can only scan horizontally.
The magnets in MRIs are extremely powerful and can attract metal even if the
metal’s inside you! An MRI isn’t for you if you have
 A pacemaker
 A cochlear implant
 Pieces of metal in your eye
 Metal clips in your brain or elsewhere
 Dental bridges
 Braces
 Belly button rings, toe rings, a pierced tongue, or any other metal deco-
rations or piercings
Diagnosing Endometriosis Surgically
The best and only way doctors can definitively diagnose endometriosis is
through surgery. During surgery, doctors have two basic options in making
the diagnosis — by taking a biopsy or by visually diagnosing the disease.
This section looks more closely at these two and also looks at what
endometriosis looks like under the microscope.
165
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

Biopsying endometriosis
Physicians refer to surgically removing endometriosis and identifying it
microscopically as the gold standard, that is, the best procedure to diagnose
endometriosis. Your doctor can make this diagnosis through laparoscopy, a
minimally invasive procedure, or by a laparotomy, a larger incision (see
Chapter 11 for descriptions of the surgeries). Biopsy of endometriosis is
fairly easy, but, like all procedures, it carries some (though small) risk. Also, a
biopsy may miss the endometriosis, or the endometriosis may be unrecogniz-
able to the pathologist due to distortion of the tissues.
Because endometriosis isn’t accessible from outside the body, a surgical pro-
cedure must provide the specimen. Two procedures are possible: an open
procedure (laparotomy) or a less invasive procedure (laparoscopy).
Although the laparoscopic approach takes more skill and experience, most
surgeons can get a specimen via this route.
The easiest way to get a specimen is by peeling or wiping it off the surface of
the pelvis or organ. Often, the early lesions (blebs and thin filmy areas) are
hardest to see but the easiest to remove during laparoscopy with special
instruments. A lab then verifies whether the pieces are endometriosis.
Peeling off lesions can also be done during a laparotomy, although seeing
these lesions without the magnification of the scope is more difficult.
Older, deeper, and more scarred endometriosis takes much more care and
skill to remove during a biopsy. The surgeon must make a shallow incision in
the surrounding tissue and remove the endometriosis (or part of it when only
biopsying). The surgeon must be very careful that the lesion isn’t stuck to an
important structure, such as a ureter, piece of intestine, large blood vessel, or
the bladder. Tearing any of these structures, especially without realizing it,
can be disastrous!
A surgeon removes endometriosis on the ovary with the same procedure.
However, when the disease has invaded the ovarian tissue, the surgeon must
save as much normal ovarian tissue as possible and then repair any damage,
which prevents adhesions. Again, only experienced surgeons should attempt
such intricate surgery, especially if the patient hopes for a future pregnancy.
Diagnosing endometriosis visually
An experienced surgeon may also recognize endometriosis visually, and he
may not biopsy at all if he sees obvious disease. Visual diagnosis also avoids
the rare but serious complications of biopsy. Given the advantages of visual
diagnosis, having an experienced surgeon who knows what he’s looking at
and is comfortable with the procedure is of utmost importance.
166
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

Many times I’ve seen new patients whose endometriosis was obviously
missed during an earlier surgery. The previous surgeon may have not recog-
nized the disease because he was relying on the textbook description — a
classic powder-burn lesion appearance. We now identify that traditional
appearance as end-stage disease (check out “Staging Endometriosis” later in
this chapter for more info). In reality, endometriosis can take on many varied
disguises, and surgeons must be trained and experienced to recognize them.
Lesions: Up close and personal
When bits of endometrial tissue turn into endometriosis, the resulting lesions
don’t look like your regular menstrual flow. So, what does endometriosis look
like to the naked eye? Well, it depends. The tissue can appear very different
from one woman to another when a surgeon views it through the laparoscope
or with his own eyes. Endometriosis from different areas in the same woman
can even look totally different from each other.
Endometriosis can be any one of a number of colors — black, blue, red,
white, brown, or clear — depending on where it is, how old the lesions are,
and what kinds of cells they contain. The tissue can be flat, raised, regular, or
irregular; it can be thin, thick, deep, or shallow. The endometriosis can con-
sist of many adhesions or none. In short, endometriosis is variable in appear-
ance; it has no definitive descriptions.
The classic description of endometriosis, which many textbooks still use, is
the powder burn and stellate lesion. Early surgeons saw these structures as
obviously abnormal tissue because the abdominal cavity and pelvis have a
pink color and the ovaries are white. Note: Your pelvic cavity has other
167
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis
Keeping calm in the MRI
Many offices now tout their MRIs as being open
and less likely to cause claustrophobia, but their
definition of open and yours may differ! If you’re
claustrophobic, undergoing an MRI even in an
open tube is a stressful experience. You need to
remain as still as possible, the machine makes
ominous noises, and even though the side may
not be totally enclosed, you will still be sur-
rounded by metal. How can you get through the
test without trying to escape in the middle of it?
First of all, remember that someone is always
within hollering distance in the room — they
don’t just walk away and leave you there. Just
knowing someone is nearby can be comforting.
Then, to get through the procedure, keep your
eyes closed to take your mind off the close
walls. Earplugs also help block out noise. They
may allow you to move your fingers a bit (some-
times just being able to move any part is com-
forting!). But always ask whether this
movement will interfere with your test. And
don’t worry — they don’t strap you in!

shades of red, blue, and gray hanging around, but nothing is dark gray to
black (powder burn) with whitish, thin bands of firm tissue that spread out
from the structure (the starlike, stellate, lesions).
The colors of a rainbow: Significant differences
Endometriosis can have many different appearances depending on the stage
(See the section “Staging Endometriosis” later in this chapter) and age of the
disease. In fact, a patient can have all the different lesions at the same time!
The lesions can appear as clear vesicles, or they can be yellow-brown, red,
dark red, dark brown, or black areas on the effected surfaces. Your doctor
may encounter the following features of these colored lesions:
 Clear: Although clear isn’t exactly a color, the clear blebs (little bubble-
like areas) are the earliest signs of endometriosis. They may be hard to
see, but, as instruments have improved, the blebs have become clearer
to the surgeon. Still, many doctors ignore them or misdiagnose them as
bubbles (from the procedure’s fluid and gas) or as artifact. A surgeon
must have experience and training to find and confidently diagnose
these structures as endometriosis.
 White, yellowish to light brown: This next stage of lesions is more visi-
ble, but a surgeon may misinterpret the lesions as remnants of the
corpus luteum (the leftover shell of the egg follicle) or other fairly normal
conditions (such as bruising from instruments to blood vessels under
the peritoneum). These lesions are often flat but may be raised slightly.
They’re soft, so a surgeon can usually rub them off the surface of a
structure. This stage of lesions can occur anywhere, and it’s metaboli-
cally (chemically) very active.
 Red: These lesions vary from bright red (like fresh blood) to dark red,
almost brown. They can occur anywhere and take on various shapes —
round, elongated, long and thin, and so on. These lesions may be more
invasive because they’re older than the white to light brown variety. Red
lesions may be deep and nodular, which leads to scarring. When a surgi-
cal instrument enters one of these lesions, a dark fluid (old blood) often
emerges. These structures are very obvious and common examples of
endometriosis.
 Dark gray to black: The classic lesions have a gun-powder burn color
and represent the disease’s end stage. The immune system has attacked
the disease, and the endometriosis is now scarred and mostly nonre-
sponsive to the menstrual cycle hormones. However, the damage is
done. Lesions have destroyed or distorted nearby tissues, and scarring
has stuck organs together (called a frozen pelvis) or caused pain and
dysfunction.
168
Part II: Digging Deeper into Endometriosis 

All these lesions can occur in the same patient at the same time. Because the
earlier blebs and yellow lesions are the most metabolically active, women
who have them also have the most symptoms. Researchers note that the
women with the least apparent disease can have the most symptoms. The
reason for this apparent paradox is that these women have plenty of
endometriosis — it just hasn’t been correctly recognized.
Looking at endometriosis under the scope
You would think that endometriosis always looks the same under the micro-
scope, right? Well, no. Even after a biopsy and under the microscope, this dis-
ease doesn’t always look the same, even in the same woman.
To diagnose this disease, the endometrial tissue, glands, and stroma must be
present in the wrong place. But, in 30 to 50 percent of cases, the biopsy fails
these criteria. How can this be? Several reasons may be possible.
 The surgeon doing the biopsy may just miss the real lesion. An area of
endometriosis has many tissue variations. The inflammatory process
can cause a change in color and distortion of the anatomy. And an area
at the edge that looks good to biopsy may just be a reaction to the dis-
ease process and not the actual endometrial implant. The actual lesion
may be much deeper and not visible. The surgeon doesn’t want to cause
harm while diagnosing the problem, so he may not biopsy deeply
enough to reach the actual active endometriosis.
 The surgeon may not recognize the active areas. The textbooks
describe classic endometriosis as black, stellate (star-shaped) lesions.
But this definition is only for the end stage of the disease, so the biopsy
may only contain scar tissue and old inflammatory cells and debris, not
endometriosis. The surgeon may not even recognize the active areas
because they may be too small, hidden, or unusual in appearance.
Sometimes the earliest lesions are clear and hard to see. Or the surgeon
may biopsy red areas that are actually bruises from the instruments.
 The pathologist doesn’t see any glands or stroma. Endometriosis implants
can become so distorted that the pathologist can’t see any glands or
stroma. The only evident glands are scattered and distorted, separate from
any recognizable stroma. Pressure from the retained menstrual blood can
squeeze the cells, making an area look different from endometrium.
Imagine a shag carpet squashed so flat that its pile looks like part of the
backing; this view is similar to what the pathologist may see.
169
Chapter 9: Do You Have Endometriosis? Your Initial Exam and Diagnosis

Staging Endometriosis
If your doctor diagnoses you with endometriosis, she may use a staging
system developed by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
(ASRM) that categorizes endometriosis into four stages based on
 The amount of endometriosis present
 The location of the endometriosis
 The severity of the disease
Surgeons further classify endometriosis as superficial or deep:
 Superficial endometriosis lies more on the surface of a structure.
 Infiltrative or deep endometriosis implants are deeper than 5 to 6 
millimeters.
Your doctor can only make this classification in your diagnosis during
surgery. With endometriosis staging, lower numbers are better. The following
classifications determine the points and stages of endometriosis:
 Superficial endometriosis of the peritoneum (1 to 3 centimeters) = 2
points
 Deep endometriosis of the peritoneum (greater than 3 centimeters) = 6
points
 Deep endometriosis of the ovary (less than 1 centimeter) = 4 points
 Deep endometriosis of the ovary (1 to 3 centimeters) = 16 points
The four stages of endometriosis have the following range of points and gen-
eral descriptions:
 Stage I: Minimal; 1 to 5 points
 Stage II: Mild; 6 to 15 points
 Stage III: Moderate; 16 to 40 points
 Stage IV: Severe; More than 40 points
Some staging classifications also categorize the color of the endometrial
implants:
 The red lesion category includes red, red-pink, and clear lesions.
 The white lesion category includes white, peritoneal defects (these are
distorted areas of the pelvic surface sometimes called windows), and
yellow-brown lesions.
 The black lesion category includes both black and blue lesions.

 Giving nonhormonal options a try
 Staying optimistic about the future
U
nfortunately, no medications are available to cure your endometriosis.
However, certain drugs may shrink the endometrial implants for a time
and reduce pain. Other drugs treat the pain and inflammation and keep them
at bay for a while. However, none of the available medications is perfect; most
of them have side effects ranging from annoying to serious. What works for
your neighbor may not work for you.
With so many drawbacks, why do doctors prescribe medications for
endometriosis? Because the meds do help with symptoms — even though the
relief may be temporary — and the meds can help avoid surgery. Oftentimes
the medications can get you through the tough times until you get pregnant
or the disease runs its course. In this chapter, we discuss the most commonly
prescribed medications and their pluses and minuses. We also tell you what
you can do to alleviate side effects.
Understanding Medical Treatment:
How Drugs Fight Endometriosis
Medication therapy isn’t a permanent cure for endometriosis. Although it
may help with symptoms for a period of time — maybe up to a year or two
after treatment stops in the case of the hormonal therapies, dietary changes,
and natural substances — medication eventually becomes ineffective and the

symptoms come back. The goal of drug therapy is to reduce, not cure, the
inflammation and pain, and minimize the destructive complications, such as
adhesions and abnormal bleeding.
Different classes of medical therapy work in different ways. Some medica-
tions relieve pain and decrease inflammation although they don’t directly
affect the endometriosis. Other therapies suppress the growth of the
endometrial tissue and cause the endometrial implants to shrink down and
become inactive.
None of the medications currently available totally eliminates endometriosis,
nor do any of them affect adhesions and anatomic distortions already pre-
sent. Even after hormonal treatment, endometriosis is still there and gradu-
ally reactivates after your ovaries start working again. Active endometriosis
returns gradually 12 to 24 months after you stop treatment.
When you start considering medication for endometriosis, the goal may
hardly seem worth the effort. Some medications take two to four months to
become effective, and you can only take them for six months or so. You
wonder whether it’s worthwhile to suffer through the side effects and then
continue the drug for such a short time after you’re pain-free. Don’t feel dis-
couraged though. These meds can still help. This section gives an overview
of how medications work to fight endometriosis in your body.
Mimicking pregnancy
Some of the most common hormonal treatments for endometriosis are
designed to trick your body into thinking you’re pregnant. The symptoms of
endometriosis usually improve during pregnancy because
 The high levels of pregnancy hormones and progesterone effectively
suppress the ovaries. Under this suppression the hormone fluctuations
of the normal menstrual cycle don’t exist.
 The high levels of progesterone stop the endometrium from growing,
and you don’t have periods.
Medications accomplish this trick by occupying (and blocking) certain recep-
tors in different parts of the brain. This blockade of the receptors stops the
ovaries from going through their natural menstrual cycle with all the associ-
ated hormonal changes. As a result, your body can experience relief from
decreased endometrial growth and decreased periods.
In pregnancy, the high level of hormones has a negative feedback on receptors
in the hypothalamus (a gland in the middle of the brain just above the pituitary
gland; see Chapter 5), and this feedback shuts down ovulation. The hormones
cause the gland to suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
174
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland (see Chapter 5 for more
details on the menstrual cycle). Birth control pills, progesterone- and estrogen-
like compounds, and certain male-like hormones work the same way. They all
occupy the receptors in the hypothalamus and fool the gland into thinking
you don’t need to make an egg. As a result, the endometrial implants aren’t
being stimulated to grow and bleed, and this decreases the symptoms of
endometriosis.
Mimicking menopause
Other hormone treatments work in a way similar to negative feedback (they
work on receptors), but these treatments work on the pituitary gland (the
gland just below the hypothalamus), tricking the body into thinking that it’s
in menopause. In natural menopause, the symptoms of endometriosis also
decrease for several reasons:
 Ovaries can’t make estrogen.
 The hypothalamus and pituitary gland go into overtime trying to make
you ovulate.
 Levels of the hormones FSH and LH soar very high, attempting to stimu-
late the ovary to mature an egg. Because there are no eggs though, noth-
ing happens.
GnRH agonists or antagonists (two classes of drugs) simulate menopause
except for one difference: Instead of increasing FSH and LH (which leads to
more eggs and more hormones!), these medications remove the stimulus to
your ovaries by lowering LH and FSH. The result is, ideally, no menstrual
cycles, no hormones, and the number-one goal — decreased amounts of
endometrial tissue and endometriosis.
Looking at Hormonal Medication Options
Doctors use a number of hormonal medications to treat endometriosis; some
treatments work better for some people, and others work better for other
people. Which medication works better for you often depends on your toler-
ance to the side effects that each medication causes.
Why do hormones decrease the symptoms of endometriosis? Because they
induce a state similar to either pregnancy or menopause. (See the section
“Understanding Medical Treatment: How Drugs Fight Endometriosis” earlier
in this chapter for further explanation.) Endometriosis symptoms generally
disappear at those two times and may stay away for long periods of time
(probably forever in menopause!).
175
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

All medications to treat endometriosis don’t work the same way, but they all
strive to achieve the same goals:
 To decrease pain
 To control other symptoms
 To lessen the damage endometriosis can cause
However, hormonal treatments aren’t for everyone. Don’t use any of these hor-
monal medical therapies in this section if you’re trying to become pregnant.
Do these hormonal treatments cure endometriosis? That’s debatable. Like
most other treatments for endometriosis, hormone medications aren’t a per-
manent cure. However, they may be able to help you out. This section delves
into the many hormonal treatment options you have and considers their
advantages and disadvantages.
Popping the Pill: Oral contraceptives
You’re probably familiar with oral contraceptives (OCs), more commonly
called birth control pills (BCPs) or just the Pill. But you may not know how
versatile they are. Preventing pregnancy is just one of their uses (although
that use has certainly changed society!).
176
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 
Hormonal treatments and their effectiveness:
Just the numbers, please
Hormonal medications are the most commonly
used treatment for endometriosis. Just how
effective are hormonal treatments? Check out
the following statistics:
 Up to 20 percent of all women who receive
treatment have pain that returns after hor-
mone treatment.
 Around 37 percent of women who use hor-
mone therapy for mild endometriosis have
pain five years later.
 Generally, 66 percent of women who have
conservative surgical treatment have a
recurrence of endometriosis within two
years after the surgery.
 Around 74 percent of women who use hor-
mone therapy for severe endometriosis
have pain five years later.

Tweaking contraceptives to treat endometriosis
BCPs contain combinations of an estrogen and a progestin (the synthetic form
of progesterone, also called progestogen). BCPs are often effective in treating
the pain and bleeding problems associated with endometriosis. Birth control
pills work because they fool your body into thinking it’s already pregnant. They
suppress the actions of the reproductive hormones LH and FSH and prevent
ovulation. Because BCPs contain a progestin every day (unlike your ovaries,
which make progesterone only after ovulation), they also inhibit the growth of
endometrial tissue. Some women have light or no periods while on them.
Variations in doses are mostly inconsequential but you may do better on one
BCP than another because of the different amounts of estradiol (the estrogen
compound in most BCPs in the United States) or progestin in each pill.
Different doses of estradiol and progestin may cause different side effects.
Don’t despair if one doesn’t work; your doctor may just suggest a different
combination. You have plenty to choose from! (Check out the sidebar
“Breaking down the Pill: Biochemistry 101” in this chapter for more info.)
Most BCPs for endometriosis are monophasic, meaning that you take the
same exact combination of drugs every day. Your doctor may recommend
that you take an active pill daily for three to four months without a break to
better simulate pregnancy and suppress endometriosis. Historically, the
normal schedule for BCPs is three weeks of hormones (active pills) and one
week of blanks (nonactive pills).
Moving (and improving) contraceptives in the 21st century
Most contraceptives are taken by mouth — because they’re oral contracep-
tives! But today, contraceptive skin patches and even vaginal rings (a
diaphragm without the innards) can dispense estrogen and progesterone in
slow-release doses. These patches and rings last for a week at a time, and then
you change them. Ortho Evra is an estrogen/progestin patch and NuvoRing is
a vaginal insert. Note: Patches may increase menstrual cramping.
177
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis
Breaking down the Pill: Biochemistry 101
The estrogen compound in most oral contra-
ceptives in the United States is a form of estra-
diol, the hormone your ovaries make. However,
the progestin element offers some variety (five
related to testosterone and one unique com-
pound). As a result, more than 40 types of BCPs
are on the market, all with varying combinations
of estradiol and one of the progestins. They’re
available in many different doses and sched-
ules. In general, the monophasic pills (all pills
contain the exact same ingredients) are better
than the biphasic or triphasic variations (differ-
ent ingredients depending on the day of your
cycle) for endometriosis.

Most of the BCPs for endometriosis now contain lower estrogen doses than
they had 20 years ago; they’re the so-called low-dose pills. Most BCPs use the
same synthetic estrogen, ethinyl estradiol, but the amounts can vary from 20
to 50 micrograms.
Your doctor may prescribe BCPs with a more potent progestin to further sup-
press endometriosis (progestins tend to decrease the growth of the
endometrium). Another possible combination is estrogen with an androgen
(male hormone) to further suppress the ovaries.
Different types of progestin have different potency, milligram per milligram,
so a 1.0 mg dose of one progestin may cause more side effects than 3.0 mg of
another type of progestin. Just because the dose of progestin is higher, don’t
assume your doctor is giving you a stronger pill. Check out Table 10-1 to see
some of the most common BCPs.

Living with the side effects
Estrogen and progestin each cause different side effects, some very serious
and some more minor. In addition to the pill-specific effects listed in the pre-
vious table, the minor side effects of estrogen and progestin in oral contra-
ceptives include the following:
 Abdominal swelling
 Ankle swelling
 Bleeding between periods
 Breast tenderness
 Increased appetite
 Nausea
 In rare cases, deep vein thrombosis (blood clots)

Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

If you suspect the prescription is causing high blood pressure or deep-vein
blood clots (which can, in rare cases, lead to heart attacks or stroke), you
need to immediately call your doctor.
On the reassuring side, a long-term study of 46,000 British women showed no
difference in mortality rates between women who took BCPs and those who
didn’t. In fact, because of the beneficial effects of BCPs, the mortality rate is
lower for reproductive-age women who use BCPs than for women in the same
age group who don’t use them.
Women who smoke have a higher risk of stroke or heart attack when taking
BCPs than nonsmokers do. If you smoke, discuss this risk thoroughly with
your doctor before taking BCPs — or, better yet, consider not smoking! If you
have a family history of clotting or if you’ve had similar clotting problems,
your doctor may want to test your hypercoaguability state (the tendency to
form clots too easily).
Benefiting (potentially) from the Pill
Some research has shown that BCPs may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer
by 30 to 50 percent and the risk of endometrial cancer by 50 percent. These
are very important potential benefits for women with endometriosis, who
may have an increased risk of ovarian cancer (see Chapter 4). Finally, some
good news, right?
Other benefits of BCPs are less dramatic (Preventing cancer is about as good
as it gets!), but they can make life better. The following are a few other bene-
fits you may notice from taking BCPs:
 They can reduce the severity of acne.
 They can reduce the amount of blood loss during the menstrual cycle
and lessen menstrual cramps (see Chapter 5).
 They may add to bone mineral density and reduce your risk of
osteoporosis.

Breast cancer and the Pill: Is there a connection?
Ever since birth control pills (BCPs) first came on
the market, their relationship to breast cancer
has been a concern. Unfortunately, studies don’t
have a clear consensus on this issue. The stud-
ies also cannot determine which women, if any,
are at risk. A 2002 study showed no increase in
breast cancer in women who take BCPs, even in
women who have taken them for 15 years or
more or who had taken them at young ages.
Undoubtedly, more studies will focus on this con-
nection in the future.

Considering progestins alone
Pregnancy often significantly reduces the symptoms of endometriosis because
progesterone levels are high. Therefore, medication that raises these hormone
levels and tricks the body into thinking that it’s pregnant can also reduce the
symptoms of endometriosis. One of the progestins, norethindrone acetate, is
also used in BCPs and other hormonal contraceptive combinations, and the
other, medroxyprogesterone acetate, isn’t.
Understanding how progestins treat endometriosis
Pseudopregnancy with progestins for endometriosis started in the 1950s and
continues to be of great benefit in some patients. Today, synthetic proges-
terone (injections or pills) usually prevents ovulation and causes the
endometrial tissue to atrophy (shrink) over time. So the treatment can reduce
the pain of the endometrial implants and possibly control other symptoms of
endometriosis.
Up to 80 percent of women with endometriosis have decreased pain while
taking progestins. Long-term progestins decidualize the endometrium. In other
words, they make the endometrium tissue thin and spongelike compared to
the thick and complex tissue that estrogen builds. The usual treatment time
is at least six months. During the first few months, you may have spotting or
irregular bleeding as your periods decrease and then stop altogether.
Knowing your treatment options
The most common progestin for endometriosis is medroxyprogesterone
acetate (MPA) with a structure very similar to natural progesterone. MPA may
have a slow onset of therapeutic effect, but adipose (fat) cells can store it for
long periods of time. If it works, you can continue MPA orally or by injection for
long periods. MPA acts like BCPs to prevent ovulation. MPA directly inhibits
endometrial growth like all progestins. And, because MPA reduces estradiol
levels, it may also have an added suppressive effect on the endometrial tissue.
The other common progestins, norethindrone and norethindrone acetate,
are in pill form and have similar effects. These drugs have a more estrogenic
effect than MPA (so bone loss and other symptoms related to low estrogen
may not be as bad), but the effect isn’t enough to cause endometrial growth.
Although megestrol acetate is seldom a treatment for endometriosis (it’s more
common in cancer treatment), it can also be an option for some women.
If you’ve been taking oral progestin and then stop, your periods may take a
few months to begin again. If you’ve been on injections, your periods can take
a long time, up to a year, to start back up again and become regular. Because
of these delays, you may want to consider another method if you plan on
trying to get pregnant soon after stopping treatment. (Table 10-2 lists the
different progestin treatment options that you have.)

Considering the side effects
Like BCPs, progestins can have side effects. Talk with your doctor if you
notice any of these problems. These side effects include
 Weight gain: Sometimes difficult to lose (especially when taking MPA).
 Depression, mood changes: Can be potentially serious.
 Irregular bleeding: May subside after the first month or two.
 Bone loss: If you’re on MPA (better known as Provera in its different
forms), your doctor may test you periodically for a decrease in bone
mineral density.
 Decreased libido (sex drive): May not be good for your sex life.
If you don’t have severe side effects and you respond well, you can stay on
the progestins almost indefinitely.
182
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Debating danazol (Danocrine)
Danazol (brand-name Danocrine) is an oral drug that was extensively used in
the past to treat endometriosis. Although it was proven to be effective, its
numerous side effects (see “Facing the side effects of danazol” later in this
chapter) have resulted in its replacement by more modern medical treatments.
However, for some women with endometriosis, it remains an optional medical
treatment.
Danazol acts like two kinds of sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone. Its
structure is very similar to testosterone, an androgen (male sex hormone).
Although women normally have androgens, the quantities are smaller than in
men. (All’s fair with Mother Nature: Men have estrogen but in a lower level
than women.) Danazol comes in capsules; the most common dose for
endometriosis is 100 to 400 mg twice a day for three to nine months.
Contemplating danazol: How does it treat endometriosis?
Like all hormone therapies and surgery for endometriosis, danazol doesn’t
cure the disease. However, danazol can help with endometriosis in the follow-
ing ways:
 Shuts down your monthly cycle: Danazol raises androgen levels in your
blood stream and lowers your estrogen levels by suppressing produc-
tion in the ovaries. This change puts the body in a menopause-like state
but doesn’t affect the pituitary gland.
 Shrinks endometrial implants: Like progesterone, danazol may have
a direct effect on the endometrial tissue. That is, it may suppress the
growth of the endometrium directly, not as a result of just lowering estro-
gen. Biopsies of the endometrium have shown this suppressive effect.
 Decreases pain from implants by depriving them of estrogen stimula-
tion: Without estrogen, endometriosis can’t grow.
Some research shows that danazol may also inhibit the immune system and
thereby decrease the inflammatory response to endometriosis. Up to 90 per-
cent of women who use danazol report improvement in symptoms of
endometriosis. Relief can come within a few months after starting treatment
and typically lasts 6 to 12 months after stopping treatment. Symptoms return
within a year for one-third of patients.
Facing the side effects of danazol
For years, danazol was the first-line hormonal therapy for endometriosis. But
doctors rarely prescribe it now as an initial treatment and limit its use to six
to nine months at a time because of its side effects when it is used. Danazol’s
side effects are common, affecting 80 percent of women who take the drug.
Most of these side effects go away within several months after stopping treat-
ment (but some may be permanent).
183
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

Side effects include
 Acne: Occurs in around 13 percent of patients.
 Decreased breast size: Uncommon but probably annoying!
 Depression and emotional changes: May include nervousness, anxiety,
and emotional ability.
 Fluid retention: Occurs in about 6 percent of patients.
 Flushing: Occurs in about 6 percent of patients.
 Increased cardiovascular risk: The rise in cholesterol is a real problem
because the drug increases LDL (the bad one) by more than 35 percent
and, worse, lowers HDL (the good stuff) by more than 50 percent. It also
adversely affects apolipoprotein levels, another indicator of increased
cardiovascular risk.
 Increased risk of ovarian cancer: Be sure to discuss this effect with
your doctor.
 Increase in male characteristics, such as deepening of the voice and
increased facial hair and body hair (hirsutism): A change in voice can
be permanent. Many women find these side effects unbearable and stop
the medication prematurely. In our experience, more than 50 percent of
women couldn’t, or wouldn’t, tolerate these side effects and stopped
taking danazol before they had a clinical response.
 Muscle cramps: May include muscles spasms or tremors, joint lock up,
or swelling.
 Oily skin and hair: Occurs in around 2 percent of patients.
 Sugar level changes: This medicine may affect blood glucose (sugar)
levels. If you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine glucose
test, or if you have any questions about this effect, check with your
doctor.
 Skin rash: Danazol may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight.
Even short exposure to the sun can cause a skin rash, itching, redness,
or severe sunburn. When you begin taking this medicine, take precau-
tions: avoid intense sunlight; wear sunglasses, a hat, and long sleeves
when you do go out; apply a good sun block; and avoid tanning salons
and tanning beds.
 Weight gain: Occurs in around 4 percent of patients.
Danazol shouldn’t be taken in pregnancy because it can harm a develop-
ing fetus. You must use a barrier method of contraception (condoms or
diaphragm) while taking danazol.
While you’re taking danazol, your menstrual period may not be regular or
you may not have a menstrual period at all. This change is normal. If regular
menstruation doesn’t begin within 60 to 90 days after you stop taking this
184
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

medicine, check with your doctor. Danazol’s effects on hormone regulation
are usually reversible. But stopping danazol can cause FSH and LH secretion
to rebound, resulting in increased fertility.
Danazol doesn’t cause bone loss, as some other hormone treatments do, but
it does cause other complications that you should be aware of. You shouldn’t
use danazol if you fall into any of the following categories:
 Breast-feeding
 Chronic liver, kidney, or heart disease, which can become worse with
danazol therapy
 High cholesterol
 Inherited disorder of skin pigment (porphyria)
 Pregnancy or possibility of pregnancy during treatment (danazol can
harm a fetus)
 Abnormal vaginal bleeding without a known cause
Trying GnRH agonists
GnRH agonists are injected or implanted medications that have found wide use
as a treatment for endometriosis. They work by causing a medical menopause
with extremely low levels of estrogen (much like natural menopause). Although
they’re an effective treatment for endometriosis, they aren’t without significant
side effects.
To understand how GnRH agonists work, you first need to understand
gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH). GnRH is a vital part of the menstrual
cycle. The hypothalamus delivers GnRH to the pituitary in a pulsatile fashion
(that is, in short bursts) about every 90 minutes. GnRH lasts a very short time
because it breaks down very rapidly while working on receptors in the pitu-
itary gland to release FSH and LH. (Checkout Chapter 5 for more information
on these two hormones.)
Understanding how GnRH agonists treat endometriosis
GnRH agonists deliver a constant stream of a molecule very similar to GnRH to
the pituitary gland. Two to three amino acids (the building blocks of proteins)
in the agonist are different from those in natural GnRH, and this small differ-
ence makes them stick around much longer than the natural GnRH. The agonist
fits on the pituitary gland’s receptors in place of the real GnRH and stays there.
The pituitary gland isn’t used to this constant stimulation (the pituitary usu-
ally sees GnRH briefly every 90 minutes). This adjustment results in a phe-
nomenon called down regulation (the pituitary gland becomes exhausted and
can no longer make FSH and LH), which eventually suppresses the hormones
LH and FSH to very low levels.
185
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

Suppressing LH and FSH means the ovaries aren’t stimulated and no ovula-
tion occurs. As a result, estrogen levels drop very low (a hypoestrogenic
state). Because estrogen levels normally stimulate growth of endometrial
implants, suppressing the estrogen levels decreases the implants and
decreases the pain of endometriosis. With no menstrual cycle (due to no ovu-
lation), the endometrium doesn’t grow and shed periodically, and you experi-
ence less inflammation from endometriosis and bleeding problems get better.
All the GnRH agonists seem to have a similarly positive effect on pain relief.
Clinical studies have compared these compounds to placebos (inert substi-
tutes) and danazol (which used to be the standard medical therapy). In these
trials, patients noted significant reduction in pain of all kinds (dyspareunia —
pain with sex; dysmenorrhea — painful menstruation; generalized pelvic
pain). For instance, GnRH reduced dyspareunia in one year in 75 percent of
women who used the medication.
Unfortunately, as with all other treatments, symptoms recurred in most women
after some period of time. One study with Lupron found that 57 percent of the
patients had recurrence of painful periods within one year of stopping Lupron.
Decreases in pain are presumably due to the low estrogen levels and lack of
ovulation. However, the low estrogen levels are also responsible for most of
the side effects with these medications. For this reason, many doctors do an
add-back therapy, that is, a medication or combination of medications that is
low enough to maintain the positive effects of the GnRH agonist and high
enough to keep symptoms of low estrogen levels to a minimum. The following
medications are possible add-back therapies:
 Low doses of estrogen
 Estrogen and progestin
 Progestin alone
 Bisphosphonate (such as Actonel or Fosamax — drugs that prevent
bone loss but don’t increase your estrogen levels)
 Progestin and bisphosphonate
You can discuss with your doctor which therapy may be best for you.
Looking at the different GnRH agonist options
When you begin taking GnRH agonists, a flare effect occurs. (Before the hor-
mone levels start to decrease, they actually increase — flare — for the first
four to ten days, causing a possible initial increase in symptoms in the first
week or two of treatment.) To help prevent, or at least blunt, this effect, you
can start the GnRH agonist about a week after you ovulate. This mid-luteal-
phase (middle of your cycle) dosing helps your own hormones block the ini-
tial flare and subsequent ovulation. Ask you doctor about the best time to
start the agonist.
186
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

You can take GnRH agonists a number of ways: injections into the muscle, a
nasal spray, or implants under the skin. However, two major drawbacks to
using GnRH agonists are that they’re expensive and unavailable in tablet
form. Table 10-3 lists the common brand names and doses of GnRH agonists.

Many women may find nafarelin (Synarel) easier to take because it doesn’t

study, nafarelin shrank endometrial implants and significantly relieved symp-
toms in 85 percent of patients and delayed recurrence of endometriosis after
surgery. Compared to leuprolide, nafarelin was less expensive, had fewer
side effects, provided a better quality of life — and didn’t use needles!
Unfortunately, the nasal spray can be hard to standardize and use, so these
benefits may not actually be as good in normal use.
Facing the side effects
Although GnRH agonists can make some women’s lives easier by treating
their endometriosis, this drug isn’t for everyone. The following people
shouldn’t take GnRH agonists:
 Women who haven’t gone through puberty yet. If you’re a young
woman, GnRH agonists prevent you from developing peak bone mineral
density (BMD, a way to measure bone mineral content) and may increase
your risk for osteoporosis later in your life. (Check out Osteoporosis For
Dummies by Dr. Carolyn Riester O’Connor and Sharon Perkins [Wiley]
for more on osteoporosis and peak BMD.) GnRH agonists may also delay
puberty.
187
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

 Women who are pregnant. Researchers aren’t sure, but GnRH agonists
may be harmful to a developing fetus. They also will decrease estrogen
and progesterone and may cause miscarriage. Although you’re unlikely
to become pregnant while using a GnRH agonist, to be completely safe,
you should use a barrier method of contraception while you’re on these
drugs. If you think you’re pregnant, tell your doctor immediately.
 Women who have pernicious anemia. This anemia results from a lack
of intrinsic factor, a protein that helps you absorb vitamin B12 from the
stomach. Decreased estrogen levels with GnRH agonists can worsen
symptoms.
You may experience a number of unpleasant side effects while on these med-
ications. Not surprisingly, these are the same symptoms you may experience
in menopause. Some common side effects are
 Menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood
swings: Just like menopause, these symptoms are annoying and life
altering. Several treatments are available. Ask your doctor.
 Headaches: May be severe and can be treated by over-the-counter
meds, such as ibuprofen.
 Insomnia: Sleeplessness or awaking in the middle of the night without
being able to get back to sleep can cause irritability and emotional
changes.
 Bone loss: Because GnRH agonists decrease your estrogen to menopausal
levels, long-term use can result in irreversible bone loss. You can experi-
ence 4 to 6 percent bone loss in a six-month treatment period; most of the
lost bone regenerates within six months of stopping treatment. Add-back
therapy (giving estrogen in addition to Lupron) may allow you to have
more extended time (more than six months) or repeat treatment.
 Vaginal dryness: This may cause painful sex and can be treated with
lubricants or local hormone cream.
Handling hot flashes
Hot flashes are one of the most annoying side effects of GnRH agonists, just
like they’re one of the most annoying side effects of menopause! You can min-
imize those effects however. To decrease hot flashes, try eliminating the fol-
lowing triggers:
 Alcohol (which can make you flushed and hot all on its own!)
 Caffeine
 Diet pills
 Hot (spicy) foods
 Hot tubs
188
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Saunas
 Smoking
 Stress
For example, if being late stresses you out, make sure you get to your
destination early! Reducing stress may not be easy, but it’s certainly
worth the trouble, not only for reducing hot flashes but also for making
your life easier and more fun overall! (We discuss ways to decrease both
pain and stress more in Chapter 12.)
You can also decrease the effect of hot flashes. For example:
 Wear layered clothing, so it’s easier to undress (one layer at a time,
please!) when you start to overheat.
 Use only cotton sheets on your bed; no synthetics.
 Dress in cotton or cotton derivatives; skip synthetic materials that don’t
let your skin breathe.
 Keep a glass of ice water nearby and sip frequently to keep your insides
cool.
 Have a fan in your bedroom — and at your desk, if possible.
189
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis
I’m burning up: Hot flash facts
The body’s drop in estrogen (which certain hor-
mone medications can artificially induce)
causes hot flashes. The decreased estrogen
affects the hypothalamus, which controls body
temperature. Because estrogen receptors are in
other parts of the brain and in the skin, the lack
of estrogen may directly affect these areas also.
The decreased estrogen causes the hypothala-
mus to think your body temperature is too hot
and sends signals to your blood vessels, heart,
and nervous system to start processes to cool
you down. Suddenly your heart starts to pound
and blood vessels dilate to bring more blood to
the skin surface to be cooled (which makes
your face look red and your sweat glands
release more sweat).
Do you feel like you’re about ready to pass out
because you’re so hot? Do your friends and
family think you’re a bit strange when you’re
wearing shorts and a sleeveless shirt on a chilly
November day? Don’t let those folks bother you.
Grab a cold drink, a fan, and arm yourself with
these interesting hot flash facts:
 An aura, (a feeling that a hot flash is about
to begin) often precedes a hot flash.
 Hot flashes usually last just a few minutes,
but they can last up to an hour and recur
several times during the day (more than 50
times a day in some studies!).
 Hot flashes usually affect your upper body
the most, especially your face and chest.
 Hot flashes can cause nausea, dizziness,
headache, or heart palpitations.
 Your skin temperature can rise as much as
6 degrees during a hot flash (that’s skin, not
internal body temperature).

Low-dose antidepressants can help with hot flashes because they disrupt epi-
nephrine and serotonin, the signals that transmit the go-ahead for hot flashes.
Up to 60 percent of women notice a decrease in hot flashes with this treat-
ment, according to one study.
Dealing with the other side effects
The side effects of GnRH agonists can usually be dealt with by taking over-
the-counter medications for headaches and pain, sleep aids, or vaginal lubri-
cation aids. If you notice side effects from these drugs, you may want to
consider one of the newer types of treatments, such as GnRH antagonists
(see “Looking at GnRH antagonists” later in this chapter.)
Inserting an IUD for pain relief
If you had an intrauterine device (IUD) in the past, the thought of using it for
pain relief may seem a little foreign to you. After all, most IUDs are pretty
uncomfortable at first, so how can one decrease pain?
IUDs are primarily a birth control device, so if you’re planning on getting
pregnant, an IUD isn’t the method to use to decrease endometriosis!
However, unlike Depo-Provera (whose effects can last for months after your
last injection), an IUD has no effects after you remove it, so you can try to get
pregnant soon after.
Understanding how an IUD can relieve endometriosis pain
Studies indicate that the LNG-IUS IUD (Mirena) may effectively relieve pain in
endometriosis. This IUD is impregnated with levonorgestrel, a progestin. This
IUD reduces endometrial cell-proliferation and increases cell self-destruction.
Progestin from the IUD mainly affects the uterus and cervix, causing fewer
systemic side effects than other forms of progestins.
The LNG-IUS has several advantages:
 It can decrease dysfunctional uterine bleeding up to 90 percent.
 It may lessen or stop menstrual bleeding altogether after the first two to
three months.
 It’s less likely to have side effects than oral progestins.
 It’s more effective in preventing pregnancy than copper IUDs.
 It may decrease your chance of developing pelvic inflammatory disease.
 It can remain in place up to five years.
190
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Determining if an IUD is right for you
IUDs can be inserted any time, as long as you’re not pregnant. The easiest
and safest time to insert one is during your menstrual cycle. Insertion takes
place in a doctor’s office in just a few minutes. Insertion can cause cramping
and light bleeding, but you may notice less discomfort if you’ve had a vaginal
delivery.
An IUD may not be a good choice for you if
 You have pelvic inflammatory disease.
 You have a sexually transmitted disease.
 You have an active cervical or vaginal infection.
 You have uterine abnormalities.
 You had a serious pelvic infection in the three months following
pregnancy.
 You have more than one sexual partner or a sexual partner who has
more than one sexual partner.
 You get infections easily (including immune-system problems), have
leukemia or AIDS, or abuse intravenous drugs.
 You possibly have uterine or cervical cancer.
 You have unexplained bleeding from the uterus.
 You have liver disease or a liver tumor.
 You have or have had breast cancer.
 You have had, or are at risk of having, an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy
occurring in the fallopian tubes).
 You are allergic to levonorgestrel, silicone, or polyethylene.
Make sure you discuss all the pros and cons with your doctor before deciding
on an IUD.
Considering serious side effects
Because IUDs are a foreign body in your uterus, they can cause serious com-
plications; call your doctor immediately if
 You don’t feel well or have a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
 You can’t feel the strings attached to your IUD or they seem to be mis-
placed (longer or shorter than usual).
 You have symptoms of a vaginal infection, such as pain, odor, and
discharge.
 You have abnormal spotting or sudden bleeding.
191
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

Living with normal side effects
An IUD can cause side effects, especially in the first few months after inser-
tion. The following are normal, but if they’re especially severe, ask your
doctor if you can take anything to combat them. Normal side effects of a
progestin-coated IUD include the following:
 Acne
 Back pain
 Breast tenderness
 Cramping
 Headache
 Menstrual changes, such as heavier flow or less flow than normal
 Mood changes
 Nausea
About 12 percent of women with the Mirena IUD have ovarian cysts. In most
cases, these cysts disappear spontaneously over two to three months.
Checking Out Nonhormonal Options
Nonhormonal options are usually the first-line drugs for endometriosis pain.
Most of these medications are available over the counter, but some do require
a prescription. Doctors also may suggest or prescribe these nonhormonal
treatments if you can’t handle the side effects of hormones or you’re trying to
get pregnant. You can read more about nonhormonal treatments and other
painkilling methods in Chapter 13, where we discuss managing chronic pain.
Using NSAIDs
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and
Naprosyn, are the mainstay and usually the first choice of treatment for
endometriosis symptoms. NSAIDs help reduce pain and the inflammation in
many diseases. You can buy them over the counter or in higher doses with a
prescription. (Check out Chapter 13 for more helpful info about NSAIDs.)
These medications are safe to use (as directed), and they can reduce the
pain of endometriosis (such as mid-cycle pain and painful periods) and help
decrease the inflammation. This anti-inflammatory benefit can potentially
decrease inflammation that leads to adhesions and scarring. Of course, these
medications can’t help with adhesions and scar tissue that are already present.
192
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

For many women, NSAIDs work well enough to make their discomfort tolera-
ble. They’re most effective when you take them as soon as, or even before,
the symptoms start. As with all pain management, you’re most successful
when you get ahead of the pain and stay there.
Trying other painkillers
If NSAIDs don’t give you enough relief to continue with everyday functioning,
then your doctor may prescribe more potent pain relievers. These drugs
belong to the class of narcotics and similar medications. Refer to Chapter 13
where we discuss these painkillers in depth.
Looking at What the Future Holds
A number of drugs may be available in the near future for the treatment of
endometriosis. Some of these drugs are older and are already effective for
other diseases, and they may prove helpful in endometriosis. Other drugs are
brand new. Do they all hold promise for the future? Undoubtedly, some of them
do; others may fall by the wayside. A few of these treatments are already in use
in Europe. In this section, we look at some possible drugs of the future.
Looking at GnRH antagonists
Although these drugs aren’t specifically approved to treat endometriosis,
some doctors do prescribe them to treat the disease. GnRH antagonists are
the new kids on the block in hormonal medications to treat endometriosis.
They seem to have several real benefits, especially with side effects. Two
common GnRH antagonists are Cetrorelix acetate (Cetrotide) and Ganirelix
acetate (Antagon). They aren’t approved yet for endometriosis, and they’re
very expensive, much more so than agonists (8 to 20 times more expensive!).
Gauging how GnRH antagonists treat endometriosis
GnRH antagonists are very similar to GnRH agonists, but they work much
more quickly than agonists. GnRH antagonists are a synthetic peptide that
competes with GnRH for its receptor site, just like agonists. Unlike the ago-
nists that initially stimulate the pituitary gland to release its store of FSH and
LH, antagonists block the action of the receptor. This blockage of GnRH action
results in the pituitary gland decreasing its output of FSH and LH immediately.
GnRH antagonists aren’t long-lasting drugs, so they’re usually given subcuta-
neously, like insulin, through daily injections. One GnRH antagonist, Cetrotide,
comes in a higher dose (3 mg) for a once- or twice-a-week dose over eight
weeks.

Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

Identifying the side effects to GnRH antagonists
Serum estradiol remains higher with this therapy (around 50 pg/ml), so side
effects related to low estrogen are less prevalent. In one study, endometriosis
patients undergoing this treatment reported a symptom-free period, with no
mood changes, hot flushes, libido loss, vaginal dryness, or other symptoms.
Antagonist side effects aren’t as severe as those from agonists. Antagonist
effects include
 Headache
 Nausea
 Itching and redness at the injection site
Pursuing antiprogestins
Antiprogestins are promising new drugs for endometriosis because they
reduce both estrogen and progesterone receptors. Currently scientists are
testing two antiprogestins:
 Gestrinone: As the most studied antiprogestin, gestrinone (Dimetriose)
seems comparable to GnRH agonists in reducing pain but with fewer
menopausal symptoms. Gestrinone also seems to have a less negative
effect on bone density. In one study, bone density even increased
slightly. The side effects are similar to androgens like danazol (see
“Debating danazol [Danocrine]” earlier in this chapter). Gestrinone isn’t
currently available in the United States.
Treatment with gestrinone includes 2.5 mg doses, two or three times per
week. Some of the negative effects of gestrinone include
• Abnormal uterine bleeding
• Acne
• Excess hair growth
• Headache
• Weight gain
 Mifepristone (Mifeprex): In one six-month study, mifepristone improved
symptoms and reduced endometrial implants without causing
menopausal side effects. Long-term use, however, may cause changes in
the uterine tissue and cell proliferation. Experience with this drug for
endometriosis is limited.
194
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Selecting SERMS
Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) are drugs that behave like
estrogen in some tissues and like estrogen blockers in others. One well-known
SERM, tamoxifen (Istubal, Nolvadex, Valodex), seems to worsen endometriosis,
but others, such as raloxifene (Evista), may decrease endometrial implants and
decrease pain.
Fulvetrant (Faslodex) is an estrogen blocker, and studies have looked at its
effectiveness for uterine fibroids and endometriosis. More testing is needed
in this area.
Examining aromatase inhibitors
Aromatase is an enzyme that makes estrogen from other hormones, and it’s
essential for most estrogen production. Researchers are studying drugs
called aromatase inhibitors for effects against endometriosis because they
block the production of estrogen. Research also shows that women with
endometriosis may have abnormal levels of aromatase in these tissues.
Aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer and other disease states include
anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, and vorozole. A 2004 study showed
that a combination of letrozole and progestin reduced endometriosis and
decreased pelvic pain. More studies are underway.
Testing SPRMs
A new class of drugs, Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRMs —
make sure you don’t add an E after the P!), have both agonist and antagonist
properties and may prove beneficial in suppressing endometrial implants.
SPRMS, also known as mesoprogestins, react differently in different tissues,
and may be used in place of GnRH agonist and antagonist drugs that have
negative side effects.
One drug in this class that is being tested and is effective in reducing non-
menstrual pain and dysmenorrhea in patients with endometriosis is asopris-
nil. Asoprisnil is undergoing clinical trials and may be available in the next
few years.
195
Chapter 10: Relying on (Prescription) Drugs to Treat Endometriosis

Finding new treatments (and wrinkles)
all the time
Researchers are considering a number of drugs for investigational testing for
use in endometriosis. Just a few examples include
 Various immune modulators: In many ways, immune therapy is still in
its infancy. Because immune issues may play a large part in endometrio-
sis, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs may stop the disease
before it becomes a problem in those women susceptible to it. (See
Chapter 4 for more on immune therapy.)
 New anti-estrogen medications: These may also prove useful in shrink-
ing endometriosis without the side effects of older medications.
 Botox (botulinum toxin): Yes, the wrinkle cure has been used with some
success in a small number of patients. It doesn’t work in any hormonal
way but may help relax muscle spasms in the pelvis, reducing pain.
196
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 
Worrying about the effect of medication
on future pregnancy
If you’re hoping to get pregnant in the near future,
taking a medication that fools your body into
thinking that it’s in menopause may not seem like
a very good idea. Decreasing your pain is cer-
tainly a concern, but decreasing your chances of
getting pregnant is a serious compromise.
Your chances of pregnancy right after stopping
medications depends on which medication you
choose. For example:
 Contraceptive effects of birth control pills
usually stop a few weeks to months after you
stop the Pill, making it a good choice if you
want to get pregnant soon after treatment.
 After you have an IUD removed, you can
start trying to get pregnant right away.
Fortunately, most of today’s drugs are short
acting and leave the body pretty quickly (except
for medroxyprogesterone acetate — MPA). As
long as you don’t get pregnant within the first
few weeks after stopping the medications, you
have no chance of the medications affecting the
egg, sperm, embryo, or fetus. In fact, discontin-
uation of the drugs may even enhance your fer-
tility initially.

Your Endometriosis
In This Chapter
 Knowing your surgical options

 Beginning conservatively
 Undergoing radical surgery
 Choosing what kind of surgery to have
D
octors often suggest medical therapy as the first treatment for
endometriosis symptoms. However, if you don’t already have a definite
diagnosis or the medication doesn’t work for you, your doctor may suggest
surgery. Surgery, then, can determine whether you actually have endometriosis
or another disease, and in most cases, your surgeon can treat the disease
during the surgery.
Don’t take surgery lightly. Risks are always present, even though small, with
anesthesia and surgery. But in many cases, surgery is the best option for
decreasing the pain and destruction of endometriosis.
Deciding to have surgery is a major decision, but we hope to make that
decision a little easier for you. In this chapter, we discuss all the current
options, the potential complications, and the benefits of surgically treating
endometriosis.
Eyeing the Two Main Surgical Methods
Choosing to have surgery to treat endometriosis isn’t simple. The first ques-
tions that come up are, “What kind of surgery? Minor or major? Laparoscopy
or laparotomy?” Which type of surgery you and your doctor decide upon will

depend on whether your surgery will be conservative (leaving as much in
place as possible) or radical (removing organs such as the uterus).
Throughout this chapter we discuss the surgical methods and options and
give you the information you need to make an informed decision.
Before you can make a decision about which surgery method is right for you,
you first need to understand the two types of treatment:
 Conservative surgery: The surgeon tries to do as little surgery as possi-
ble in order to preserve function of your reproductive organs. She may
remove cysts, adhesions, fibroids, abnormal tissue, and even a whole
ovary if the other ovary is functional. The goal is to help your symptoms
but keep the uterus, tubes, and ovaries (at least one good one) so that
your menstrual cycle can continue. (See the section “Starting Surgical
Treatment Conservatively” in this chapter.)
 Radical surgery: Don’t let the term concern you. With endometriosis,
radical surgery simply means that the surgeon removes your uterus,
tubes, and ovaries. (We discuss radical surgery in depth in the section
“Opting for Radical Surgery” later in this chapter.)
If you’ve unsuccessfully tried conservative surgery and every medical option
possible to relieve your symptoms and you don’t want to get pregnant in the
future, radical surgery may be your best option. Sometimes the surgeon
leaves one or both ovaries in, but this decision may undermine the success
of the radical surgery.
In the vast majority of cases, surgery for endometriosis means choosing an
approach for the surgeon to see inside the pelvis and abdominal cavity.
Because every surgery requires an incision of some size somewhere, the
location and size of that incision dictate the type of surgery. Your surgeon
has two choices:
 Laparoscopy: This method is less invasive and uses a small incision,
much less than an inch, to allow access to the abdominal cavity. This
choice probably sounds good to you — why have a big incision when
you can have a small one?
 Laparotomy: This method uses an incision ranging from a couple of
inches to 12 inches or more in length. For example, cesarean section
scars are laparotomy incisions. These incisions can be horizontal across
the lower abdomen or vertical from the pubic bone to the umbilicus and
above. This method is an open procedure, allowing your surgeon to see
and feel more.
198
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

However, no two situations are ever the same, and no two patients are identi-
cal. Just because someone you know had one type of procedure and swears
by it doesn’t mean that procedure is the right choice for you. You may end up
swearing at it! This section looks more closely at laparoscopy and laparo-
tomy and helps you see the advantages of each surgical method.
One option: Having a laparoscopy
Laparoscopy has become the most common way to diagnose and surgically
treat endometriosis. The procedure has come a long way since the 1970s
when surgeons used it exclusively for tubal ligations and simple diagnoses.
In its early days, the telescope optics and the brightness of the light sources
were barely adequate to see fuzzy shapes, and surgeons had only a few crude
instruments. These limitations minimized the usefulness of laparoscopy.
However, with the explosion of technology in surgical instruments (refer to
“Naming the Surgical Tools” later in this chapter for more specifics) and train-
ing in this procedure over the past three decades, laparoscopy has become
very popular. For example, many training programs include extensive labs
with computer-aided simulations and animal labs that offer doctors invaluable
experience and training. Numerous post-graduate courses are available for
doctors who didn’t get this training in their residency program — probably
because it hadn’t been invented yet!
199
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis
When endometriosis isn’t the problem: 
Finding the real culprit
If endometriosis is not your main problem, then
surgery may expose the real culprit. Your sur-
geon may be able to remove that new problem
right then, or you may need another treatment
altogether.
Various surgical scenarios allow the surgeon to
identify the source of pain. For instance, an
appendix stuck to other areas by adhesions from
chronic inflammation can cause right lower-
abdomen pain. During surgery, the doctor can
remove the appendix and, as a result, reduce the
symptoms.

However, even with all this progress, not every gynecologic surgeon can
do advanced laparoscopic surgery. Be sure you ask your surgeon about his
qualifications because he needs to feel comfortable about his skills — and
so do you! Note: Just because a doctor doesn’t want to work through the
laparoscope doesn’t mean he’s a poor surgeon. Actually, the opposite is true;
doing a procedure through the scope may not be in your best interest. Discuss
the pros and cons of each approach with your doctor.
Proceeding through a laparoscopy
Laparoscopy is practical for almost any type of surgery imaginable, including
hysterectomy, removal of ectopic pregnancies, appendectomy, gall bladder
removal, bowel resection, stomach stapling for obesity, removal of lungs, and
even radical surgery for cancer. The list gets longer every day.
In gynecologic surgery, a laparoscopy has the nickname of belly button
surgery because it almost always uses a small incision in, or just below, the
umbilicus. (Obviously you need to shelve any navel embellishments or jew-
elry for this surgery!) Rarely, the entrance incision is somewhere else on the
abdominal wall.
A laparoscopy (check out Figure 11-1) usually follows these steps:

Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

1. An anesthesiologist or an anesthetist puts you to sleep.
(Check out the next section for more anesthesia information.)
2. The surgeon performs a vaginal exam before the surgery while you’re
asleep or relaxed.
This exam can be more accurate than one in the office because you’re
more relaxed (you can’t get much more relaxed than asleep!), and your
bladder is empty and doesn’t get in the way (see Chapter 3 to see the
close proximity of the uterus and bladder). You have a catheter during
the surgery, and it may remain until you’re fully awake.
3. The surgeon makes a small incision into your abdominal cavity.
4. Using a small, blunt needle or a similar device, the surgeon inserts gas
(usually carbon dioxide) into the abdominal cavity.
5. The surgeon slides a trocar (a tube with a valve to prevent loss of the
gas) into the cavity, allowing him to place the scope and see inside.
Because the surgeon can’t see or avoid possible abnormal anatomy, he
must place the needle and trocar (most have fairly sharp ends!) blindly
into the area. This step is the most risky part of the procedure.
6. The surgeon makes at least one additional incision (and usually two
or three) as an accessory port below the umbilical incision.
These incisions are usually about a half-inch long and provide access to
the site for other instruments, such as scissors, lasers, or graspers
during the procedure. Sometimes a larger accessory port is necessary
for removal of big pieces of tissue or organs.
7. A camera at the end of the scope (some have the camera at the tip that
goes inside you but most are on the end that is outside you) feeds the
image to a monitor (large TV) so the surgeon and assistants can see
their work.
Because the image is limited to two dimensions, the surgeon must rely
on his experience and use great care to prevent complications. Picture
printers, VCRs, or CD recorders can record your surgery for future refer-
ence (and may be available for your records).
8. Because the surgeon can now see inside the cavity with the laparo-
scope and avoid vulnerable structures, he can insert the accessory
ports safely.
9. Using a gentle probe or a grasper to move organs, the surgeon looks
around the entire abdominal cavity, checking out your liver, gall blad-
der, intestines, bladder, and pelvic organs.
He can deal with any problems at this point or document them for future
care.
201
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

10. Your surgeon may do a dilation and curettage (D&C) or hysteroscopy
(a technique to examine the inside of the uterus with a smaller
telescope).
These techniques allow him to be sure the inside of the uterus has no
abnormalities, and he may run dye through the fallopian tubes to check
for blockage.
11. At the end of the procedure, the surgeon closes all incisions under the
skin with dissolving sutures or with tissue glue closure that requires
no sutures.
You may have a small bandage over the incisions to keep them clean (thus
another nickname — band-aid surgery). Sometimes a harmless string
emerges at the incision site and either dissolves or can be removed.
If you’ve had a previous laparotomy or have a known infection in the
abdominal cavity, the chance of running into adhesions and intestinal
or bladder injury on insertion of the needle or trocar can be high. In
this case, your surgeon may make a slightly larger opening into the
abdominal cavity first and then place a blunt trocar to avoid the risky
blind insertion with a sharp instrument. However, because studies don’t
show that this approach greatly reduces injury and is larger and more
time consuming, it’s fairly uncommon.
Considering anesthesia during laparoscopy
Almost all laparoscopies require general anesthesia, especially if your doctor
expects to remove or rearrange tissues. General anesthesia allows for better
and more predictable relaxation of the abdominal muscles, which makes the
surgery safer and easier.
The newer anesthetic medications
 Are very safe and gentle on your system
 Put you to sleep quickly, easily, and safely and allow you to awaken just
as quickly
 Have an amnesiac effect so you don’t remember any discomfort
 Often include an analgesic so you have pain relief before you perceive
any pain (a definite plus!)
Usually a person from the anesthesia department interviews you about your
medical and surgical history before the surgery and tells you about the drugs
and what to expect. A representative from your doctor’s office, the hospital,
or the anesthesia department will also contact you with specific instructions
for you to follow before your arrival.
202
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

On the day of surgery, the following steps occur:
1. A nurse places an intravenous line (the IV) in your arm to provide your
future medications quickly and easily — and without more needles.
2. You may receive a sedative to help you relax while you wait.
(If you have any anxiety or fears, this medication can be a godsend — a
strange place with many new faces can be scary!)
In the operating room, the following take place:
1. You’re moved onto the operating table, and the anesthetist or anesthe-
siologist gives you several medications.
2. A mask is placed over your mouth with oxygen to ensure that you
have enough oxygen during the surgery.
3. As soon as you’re deeply asleep and your muscles are relaxed, a tube
or similar device is placed through your mouth or nose into the tra-
chea (wind pipe) to
• Be sure you receive enough oxygen.
• Prevent stomach contents or excess saliva from getting into your
lungs.
Anesthesia has greatly improved over the years. Still, don’t plan on driving or
making important decisions for 24 hours!
203
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis
Using MAC during surgery: 
Advantages and disadvantages
Some surgeons and anesthesiologists perform
uncomplicated and quick procedures (usually
tubal ligations or purely diagnostic procedures)
with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation
known as Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC).
The plus side: You aren’t as deeply asleep with
MAC, and you don’t have a breathing tube.
MAC has some disadvantages for abdominal
surgery, however, so be sure you know the facts
before you opt for this approach. Some disad-
vantages are
 Your abdominal organs may not be as
relaxed as they are with general anesthesia.
 Although the surgeon can numb the incision
areas with a local anesthetic (such as
Novocain), he can’t adequately anesthetize
the internal covering of the cavity or the
organs that he moves and pokes. As a
result, you may have some very uncomfort-
able moments, and you can’t just stop in the
middle of the procedure!
 The pressure of the gas that separates the
organs can make you feel like you can’t
breathe — not a pleasant feeling and highly
anxiety-provoking.

Treating endometriosis during laparoscopy
While your surgeon is looking inside you, what can he do if he finds
endometriosis (or any other problem for that matter)? The answer depends
on what you discussed when you signed the informed consent.
For example, if this is purely a diagnostic procedure, the surgeon looks around,
possibly puts dye through the tubes, and may break up minor adhesions. If
you hope to get pregnant and signed a consent for the surgeon to take any
necessary steps, he can also try to make the anatomy as normal as possible.
If you’ve had multiple surgeries and this surgery is an attempt to end the
problem forever, he can do a hysterectomy and remove the tubes and ovaries
(check out “Having a hysterectomy” later in this chapter for more information).
In short, your doctor’s actions during the laparoscopy depend on your previ-
ous discussions about possible complications and risks, the severity of your
symptoms, your previous history, your expectations, your desire for preg-
nancy now or in the future, your age, and the comfort level of the surgeon
(that is, his skill level, his assessment of the risks and benefits for you, and
his understanding of your expectations).
Passing through the recovery phase
People have different pain tolerances, so predicting when you’ll be back to
normal after laparoscopy isn’t easy. Some patients return to work the next
day, and other people take weeks. Your recovery also depends on the actual
procedures during surgery. Cutting a few adhesions and removing implants
and cysts can be fairly pain-free because these structures have no pain
nerves. But if your doctor has removed a lot of peritoneum or vaporized or
cauterized endometriosis, you may have more pain because the peritoneum
has pain fibers that respond to any disturbance.
Your doctor can let you know about returning to normal activities, but again,
a lot depends on the surgery and how your body responds to it. Be sure to
ask about sexual activity. Each surgeon has suggestions on timing, but some
of the decision depends on the extent and type of surgery (such as vaginal
work, D&C, or a hysteroscopy).
Taking care of your incision
The wounds on the skin of the abdomen can hurt just like any other cut.
Many surgeons use a local anesthetic, such as marcaine, in these sites to help
relieve pain. The size of the incision can also, of course, add to the discom-
fort. And types of closure also affect your recovery. Sutures through the skin
are more painful than sutures underneath, and a tissue glue closure normally
causes the least pain.
No matter what kind of closure or incisions you have, you can decrease the
recovery discomfort in several ways:
204
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Keep the wounds clean and covered until your doctor tells you to
remove the bandage.
 Don’t let clothing (especially elastic bands or belts) or jewelry rub
against the wounds.
 Use a mild soap to gently lather the area, then rinse it well and replace
the bandage.
 Apply an ice pack for 30 minutes and then remove it for 30 minutes as
often as feasible the day of surgery. (For the first 24 hours, an ice pack
can help decrease the swelling and inflammation.)
 After this first 24 hours, heat can help healing in the area. Three or four
times a day, use heat just above body temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.
Your doctor prescribes pain medication based on the extent of the surgery,
including ibuprofen to opioids. If you’re not getting adequate pain relief from
your medication, let your doctor know.
Ouch! Why your throat may hurt
Perhaps the worst part of the immediate recovery is the sore throat from the
breathing tube. Though the anesthesiologist may give you medication to pre-
vent it, most people still feel the effects. The discomfort usually doesn’t last
long, and you shouldn’t see any blood. The treatment is the same as for any
sore throat: lozenges, warm saltwater gargles, or analgesics.
Before you leave the recovery area, ask the anesthesiologist about any spe-
cial difficulties you may have had during surgery so she can help you deal
with them. If your sore throat persists or gets severe or if you see blood in
your sputum or have trouble breathing, let your doctor know immediately.
The breathing tube is necessary because your abdominal muscles need to
relax for surgery. The anesthesiologist administers a paralyzing medication
to relax these muscles, but the drug also reduces your ability to breathe on
your own. So, the anesthesiologist inserts an endotracheal tube into your
bronchus to provide additional oxygen and to prevent you from aspirating
(getting something into your lungs — not good). Although the endotracheal
tube is the safest and most common instrument, other devices are also avail-
able, such as the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or the nasotracheal tube, but
they all accomplish the same goal.
Another option: Choosing laparotomy
Laparotomy means to enter the abdominal cavity via a large, or relatively
large, incision. With the advent of mini-laparotomy techniques, the incision
may be as small as 4 centimeters (about an inch and three-fourths), which is
still bigger than the 1-centimeter incision for laparoscopy but far smaller
(and easier to heal) than the common 12-inch wounds a few years ago. Before
205
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

the boom of laparoscopic technology and training, a laparotomy was the only
way to really treat endometriosis. Even today, most training programs teach
procedures using laparotomy.
Sizing up a laparotomy
During a laparotomy, your surgeon makes a vertical or horizontal incision.
The cut can go from the top of the pubic bone to the navel (and beyond, if
necessary), or it can be across the lower abdomen, from the top of one hip-
bone to the other. The size of the incision depends on the procedure and the
need for exposure of structures.
Most gynecologic cases (such as cesarean sections) use a transverse (hori-
zontal) incision that extends from a couple of inches to more than 12 inches,
depending on the procedure. Most general surgeries use a vertical incision,
and some gynecologic cases may also require this approach. Ask your sur-
geon which incision he plans to use and why.
Noting the treatment advantages of laparotomy to laparoscopy
Sometimes a laparotomy is necessary or more beneficial than a laparoscopy.
Although laparotomies do result in a larger incision and slower healing time,
they have the following advantages over laparoscopy:
 Laparotomy gives the surgeon as much room as he needs to perform a
procedure. The incision can be big enough to get instruments, hands,
and assistants’ hands into the area. Because exposure (accessibility) is
the mantra of surgery, the laparotomy was the only approach for many
years. This need for exposure is still true of many procedures, especially
those that require extensive tissue removal or reconstruction.
Furthermore, a laparotomy allows the surgeon more room to readily
repair damage to the ureter, major blood vessels, intestines, bladder,
uterus, and other organs.
 Most surgeons are trained to do laparotomies. Most training programs
still teach doctors to do major procedures, such as hysterectomy,
myomectomy (removing fibroids), oophorectomy (removing ovaries), and
salpingectomy (removing ovaries and tubes), via laparotomy. However,
this preference may change as more gynecologists receive training in
laparoscopy and as the equipment becomes more available.
 Laparotomy makes viewing and removing extensive adhesions and
distorted anatomy easier. With the exposure of a laparotomy, the sur-
geon and his assistants can actually place their hands into the pelvis to
feel for problems and expose areas better. This accessibility is very
important when dealing with dense scar tissue, anatomic distortions
and malformations, and large growths (such as fibroids and cysts).
 Laparotomy allows easier removal of potentially dangerous lesions
from the pelvis. The surgeon may not want anything to spill from the
pathology he is removing, particularly if cancer is a concern. But
206
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

spillage from endometriomas, dermoid cysts, and even fragments of
fibroids can also cause problems. Laparotomy gives the surgeon a better
chance to remove all the pathology easily and cleanly.
 Laparotomy lets the surgeon do more extensive removal of lesions
while avoiding vital structures. Most surgeons are better trained to do
extensive surgery via laparotomy and can do it quicker and with less
risk of injury to other organs and structures.
Granted, the few surgeons who perform advanced laparoscopic surgery will
say that all these advantages are also possible through the scope. And that’s
true, but very few surgeons are capable of performing all these procedures as
well via laparoscopic surgery. Your doctor may feel more confident with
laparotomy, and the doctor’s level of confidence is important!
Recovering from laparotomy
For a laparotomy, you can follow all the same guidelines as for a laparoscopy
(see the section, “Passing through the recovery phase” earlier in this chapter).
These guidelines include ice the first 24 to 48 hours (to decrease swelling and
pain) and then regular heat on the incision to help healing.
However, the recovery process for a laparotomy is a bit more complicated
than a laparoscopy because the incision is larger and surgery is more com-
plex. Most patients stay overnight after laparotomy for the following reasons:
 The wound is usually too painful and your movement too restricted for
the first 24 to 48 hours for you to be comfortable at home. Regular pain
medication is important and may not be available at home. The hospital
staff can monitor the powerful pain medications after a laparotomy to be
sure that you don’t have a problem with blood pressure or breathing.
 The digestive system sometimes doesn’t work well after laparotomy. A
problem called ileus (the intestines just stop functioning) can occur and
lead to major problems. The problem can be hard to monitor at home,
and the resulting complications can be very serious.
 The wound runs the risk of bleeding. The hospital staff can watch your
incision for the first 24 hours or so.
The incision can disrupt the abdominal muscles and their attachments, and it
opens up the fascia (the tough white tissue that supports the abdominal wall
and attaches muscles to bones). Remember these facts about the fascia:
 The fascia must heal before full strength and function of the abdominal
muscles returns.
 During this healing process, movement of any kind can be painful.
 The fascia takes about two weeks to regain most of its strength, but ten-
derness can remain for a while longer.
207
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

The laparotomy wound is more likely to get infected than a smaller laparo-
scopic incision. Contact your doctor if you have redness, firmness, or
increasing pain and discharge from the wound because any of these symp-
toms can signify infection.
Most surgeons close laparotomy wounds with metal staples or sutures of other
material that must be removed. These closures can come out in three to five
days, but occasionally they need more time. (Your doctor can make that call.)
Be sure to keep the sutures clean and free from irritation. Sometimes the
sutures are under the skin and dissolve away on their own. Although most of
these sutures don’t need removal, you should take the same precautions as for
the above-ground variety.
Due to all these recovery factors, your return to work and other normal activi-
ties can’t be as quick as with a laparoscopy. Ask your surgeon about returning
to normal activities, but resign yourself to at least two weeks (and probably
four to six weeks) of minimal activities.
Naming the Surgical Tools
Wouldn’t it be great if your physician could wave Dr. McCoy’s diagnostic tri-
corder in Star Trek over your body to make a diagnosis? Despite all the tech-
nological advances in the past three decades, surgeons still have to rely on
today’s surgical tools to help them treat endometriosis.
Various companies have developed ingenious devices for many more proce-
dures via laparoscopy. These devices can
 Make entrance and exit easier and safer
 Grasp tissue gently and minimize trauma
 Remove tissue neatly
 Cut with less bleeding and collateral damage
 Prevent spillage of irritants and pieces of tissue
Nevertheless, the surgeon must still make an incision to see and work inside
your pelvis and abdominal cavity with a laparoscope. The usual size of scopes
today is 5 or 10 millimeters (1⁄5 to 2⁄5 of an inch) in diameter. This requires an
incision of less than an inch, but it still requires an incision. Newer scopes (as
small as 2.8 mm) aren’t common yet, but they’re on the way.
This section looks at some of the surgical tools for a laparoscopy or laparo-
tomy, the technology behind these tools, and your doctor’s decisions about
tools for your surgery.
208
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Cutting with knives and scissors
Many surgeons still use the tried-and-true scalpel (knife) and scissors.
Surgeons use the scalpel — almost exclusively — for the initial incision in
laparotomies and laparoscopies. The scalpel is useless after the initial inci-
sion in laparoscopy, but some surgeons use scalpels in laparotomy to remove
adhesions, organs, and other pathology.
Scissors are very common in laparotomy because surgeons have room to get
their hands in the incision. Scissors have several advantages as tools:
 They’re cheap.
 They can be sterilized to use over again.
 They do a fine job of cutting.
 They allow a surgeon to feel what he’s doing with his hands.
 They have a variety of uses.
 They’re very safe because they don’t use any other energy source. They
don’t cause collateral damage like other methods (such as cautery) can.
Scissors are available for use in laparoscopy as well, with long handles that
fit through the tiny incisions. They have the same safety profile as laparo-
tomy scissors, and surgeons are comfortable with them. However, the cost is
higher than for laparotomy because most laparoscopic scissors are dispos-
able and have a one-time use.
Vaporizing tissues: Electrosurgery
Almost as old as the scalpel and scissors is electrosurgery, which converts
energy into heat. Electrons are generated at a frequency in the range of AM
radio stations, hence the term radio frequency for this energy. The varying
types of electron waves produce different effects in tissue. Two types of
currents are
 A cutting current: A continuous, high-frequency flow of electrons
without going to zero so electrons constantly flow to the tissue. This
method causes instant vaporization of the water in the cells so they
explode! This instantaneous vaporization of the cells prevents spread
of harmful heat to surrounding tissues, so it minimizes collateral damage
to nearby structures and helps to lower the chance of adhesions and
other complications.
209
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

 A coagulating current: The current goes to zero between the peaks.
This interrupted current causes dehydration, not vaporization, of the tis-
sues and denatures the proteins. (Think of cooking eggs where the clear
proteins turn white and firm.) Although this effect stops bleeding, it
allows heat to build up in the tissues and is more likely to cause collateral
damage.
Some surgeons use electrocautery to burn away the endometriosis. This
method is very effective in getting rid of the disease, but the destructive
energy of this device can spread over 1 centimeter (there are approximately
2.5 cm per inch). Using electrocautery is like using a nuclear bomb; you
destroy the target but you also do extensive collateral damage. Newer devices
have been developed to minimize this problem but all have some drawbacks.
Both laparotomy and laparoscopy use electrosurgery. Some newer devices
combine paddles for coagulation with a knife blade for speed, and other
devices add this energy to scissors for coagulation while cutting. Each
method has advantages and disadvantages.
Beaming away the tissues: Lasers
Laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
Laser is a finely focused beam of electromagnetic radiation of a certain wave-
length. These wavelengths are in or around the visible light spectrum.
Through the magic of television and movies, many people have formed ideas
about lasers and their uses. And because of this introduction, laser is the
most misunderstood term in surgery. People may think laser surgery means
no cutting and no incision, as if surgeons just aim the laser through the skin
and the problem evaporates. In fact, many doctors advertise that they do
laser surgery, perhaps implying that it is magic and special. But laser surgery
is simply one of many means to an end — the cutting and removal of various
tissues and pathology.
The radiation in laser isn’t the same type as in X-rays or bombs that can cause
cancer. Laser radiation’s energy is in the form of photons (pockets of light that
electrons create when they go to lower energy levels in atoms). Simply put,
laser is concentrated light that’s similar to the intense, focused light of a
magnifying glass when it burns paper or wood, except laser contains only one
color of light. The biggest problems with lasers are the cost (literally tens of
thousands of dollars), their bulkiness in tight surgical areas, and the need for
specially trained personnel.
210
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Several kinds of lasers are available for use in all parts of the body. But the
main lasers in gynecologic surgery are
 Carbon dioxide: Best for cutting and vaporizing tissue
 Potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP): Causes coagulation rather than
vaporization; used to treat deep endometriosis and bleeding
 Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG): Penetrates deeply
into tissue
 Argon: An inert gas; used similarly to KTP
Surgeons can apply lasers to tissue in various ways, such as glass fibers, crys-
tal tips, and mirror-focused beams, to name a few. As with electrosurgery, the
tissue reactions vary due to different power densities and wavelengths. All
lasers can be used in open (laparotomy) or closed (laparoscopy) cases.
(Sorry, Dr. McCoy, none of these work without an incision for gynecologic
surgery — not yet anyway!)
Using the harmonic scalpel
The relatively new kid on the block is an ultrasonic device called the harmonic
scalpel. This device uses rapid vibration (55,000 per second!) to disrupt the
proteins in tissue. You may know this from the device your dentist uses to
clean your teeth. The vibration or movement of the tips or blade causes cavita-
tion (collapse) of the tissue and disruption of the proteins with implosion of the
cells. Besides the rapid movement of the device over very small distances, no
other energy source is used, so the risk of damage to surrounding structures is
minimal, just like the tartar on your teeth is removed without damage to your
teeth or gums.
The ultrasonic device comes with different tips to do a variety of tasks. Your
surgeon can use them in both open and closed surgeries for removing adhe-
sions, fibroids, cysts, ovaries and tubes, the appendix, the whole uterus, and
many other tissues. Besides excision, they can also destroy or ablate tissue,
including endometriosis. The biggest drawback of this device is the question-
able ability to prevent some types of bleeding so a second instrument, like
the electrosurgery machine, may be needed.
Putting everything back together
Any time your doctor makes an incision, he needs to seal it in some way. But
if the thought of stitches or metal clips bothers you, welcome to the world of
Star Trek closings!
211
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

The following are just a few of the ways your doctor can close your incision
without staples or exposed sutures:
 Sutures that dissolve under the skin so you won’t ever see them
 Tissue glue for small incisions — no sutures at all
Ask your surgeon how he plans to close your wounds so you’re prepared for
it when you wake up.
Knowing which tool is better
So futuristic, science-fiction tools are still a few years away, but how does a
surgeon decide which tools to use today, and does that choice make a differ-
ence in your treatment? Current studies don’t show that one tool is superior
to all others in every circumstance, but surgeons tend to strongly advocate
one device as the best and only one they use.
However, having a surgeon who’s proficient in all (or most) of today’s tech-
nologies is a good idea. (Just ask what he prefers.) Each patient is different
and each instrument has its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, what hap-
pens if the only tool your doctor uses is unavailable? He’s out of luck — and
so are you! Fortunately, surgeons have many tool choices, and he should be
able to use most of them.
Starting Surgical Treatment
Conservatively
You may assume a surgery is conservative or radical depending on the
method. In other words, you may think laparoscopic surgery is conservative
and laparotomies are radical. However, the terms conservative and radical
have nothing to do with the method of incision. Instead, they refer to the sur-
gical procedure your doctor performs. Both radical and conservative proce-
dures can be done via laparotomy or laparoscopy.
This section looks at some of the more conservative procedures your doctor
may perform during your surgery. Some of these techniques directly tackle
the endometriosis, and others help reduce pain. Conservative surgery for
endometriosis is possible via laparoscopy or laparotomy.
212
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Cutting away adhesions
The simplest conservative treatment for endometriosis is the removal of
adhesions (scar tissue) around the ovaries, tubes, and uterus. The risks of
this treatment are minimal (unless the scar tissue is very dense and around
vital structures), but the results can be dramatic. Surgery is via a
laparoscopy or a laparotomy, using scissors, electrosurgery, laser, harmonic
scalpel, or a blunt instrument to simply break down thin, filmy adhesions.
If adhesions are causing your pain, you should feel better almost immediately
after they’re removed. If your problem is infertility, cutting adhesions around
the tubes and ovaries and squirting dye through the tubes may significantly
improve your chances of getting pregnant.
Trying ablation of endometriosis
No matter which approach you choose (laparotomy or laparoscopy), dealing
with endometriosis lesions through ablation (surgical destruction) or exci-
sion (removal) remains controversial. Some surgeons prefer to remove only
lesions involving important structures. Other surgeons remove every last bit
of disease they can see. Who’s right? Both — and neither. You should discuss
these issues and the pros and cons with your doctor.
Your doctor may use any or all of the instruments in the section, “Naming the
Surgical Tools” earlier in this chapter. Some instruments are better than
others for certain procedures, and some surgeons use more than one device
during a procedure.
Using the different tools, your doctor can ablate implants in several ways
(check out Figure 11-2):
 She can scrape or pick off superficial, loose implants from the struc-
ture. This method has the following benefits:
• Causes minimal disruption of the surface
• Involves little, if any, bleeding
• Provides a biopsy specimen for pathology
 Your doctor can excise the lesions. If the lesions are deeper or don’t
come off the surface easily, she may have to cut out them. This method
• May damage the structures below or around the implants when the
implant is removed, so the surgeon must be careful.
• Requires the surgeon to take a margin of normal-looking tissue
with the implant because microscopic endometriosis reaches
some distance around the main, easily visible lesion.
213
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

 Your doctor can destroy the lesions. If she doesn’t remove the implants,
your surgeon can rely on electrosurgery, laser, or ultrasonic energy to
destroy them. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, but the
goal is to totally destroy the implant with the least amount of damage to
surrounding tissues.
Any instrument that can cut the surface with the disease can also remove
the implant entirely. Scissors are fine but may cause bleeding; electro-
surgery can cut and coagulate the bleeding, but the energy may cause
collateral damage. Lasers and ultrasonic devices can cut and remove
tissue with the same caveats as the electrosurgery. Likewise, any of these
tools can be used to ablate the tissue. Which method is best?
• Electrosurgery with a needle-point probe and cutting current can
be very accurate and effective. It also works well on lesions with
blood or liquefied tissue.

• The carbon dioxide laser causes minimal peripheral damage, and
its tiny spot size can be very precise. However, this laser isn’t as
good as other lasers or electrosurgery for lesions with blood of liq-
uefied tissue and lacks the ability to stop bleeding.
• Because the KTP and nd-YAG lasers are effective through fluid and
are absorbed by the pigment in endometriosis, they can be good in
larger lesions. They’re particularly good in the treatment of
endometriomas. But because they coagulate and don’t vaporize,
they have a greater chance of damaging surrounding tissues.
• Ultrasonic devices can be used to destroy the lesions, but they
may cause collateral damage and don’t coagulate well.
No matter which method the surgeon uses to excise or destroy the
lesions, denuded (bare) tissue remains, leaving the underlying tissue
without its slick covering. Because the denuded tissue is vulnerable to
new adhesions, surgeons have devised various methods to prevent
these raw areas from forming adhesions. These methods include
• Taking omentum (the sheet of fat that’s covered by peritoneum)
from the perineum to cover the denuded tissue
• Adding various commercial adhesion-preventing fluids or patches
made from animal tissue or synthetic material
The larger the area of disease that the surgeon excises, the greater the
chances of bleeding, adhesion formation, and injury to a blood vessel of
another organ.
Removing ovarian cysts — How much?
The ovary is a special case when treating endometriosis. Surgeons have no
standard for treating these lesions, but your surgeon must be careful not to
decrease ovarian reserve (see Chapter 7) if you plan to become pregnant in
the future.
If surgery removes parts of the ovary with the endometriosis or inadvertently
destroys parts by collateral thermal damage from a device, then primary folli-
cles are also lost. Because every woman has a finite number of eggs, anything
that decreases this number can lead to premature ovarian failure, premature
menopause, and infertility.
215
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

The Catch-22 is that not treating the underlying endometriosis can lead to the
same fate! This problem is especially true of chocolate cysts (endometriomas).
The surgeon must try to remove or destroy all the disease while saving the
ovarian tissue.
Should a surgeon remove endometriomas? Most specialists think they should
take the endometriomas to save ovarian tissue from destruction. Medical
therapy with GnRH agonist doesn’t appear to be effective for endometriomas
(see Chapter 10 for more on treating endometriosis with medication). In
cases where pregnancy is the goal, in vitro fertilization (IVF) without removal
of small endometriomas may work well. Because science has no one right
answer at this time, surgeons must deal with each case individually.
If a surgeon plans to remove an endometrioma or any other cyst, he has two
basic concerns:
 He needs to take out the whole cyst, wall, and all its contents, if possi-
ble. Any spilled contents of the cyst must be removed.
 He doesn’t want to harm the normal ovary, but he does want to leave as
much healthy ovarian tissue as possible. The patient’s desires for future
pregnancy and her age are important factors. If she doesn’t hope to
become pregnant and has no concerns about early menopause, then the
surgeon can be more aggressive in dealing with a cyst.
In some cases the cyst may have totally destroyed the ovarian tissue, so the
surgeon must remove the whole ovary to prevent future problems. Still, these
are rare cases; generally the surgeon should try to save as much of the ovary
as possible. Although surgeons can remove cysts laparoscopically, some cases
may be safer via laparotomy to be more precise and to save more ovarian
tissue.
Looking at LUNA
Laparoscopic Uterine Nerve Ablation (LUNA) is a conservative surgical proce-
dure used to help dysmenorrhea, or painful periods, which can be caused by
endometriosis. During the procedure, the surgeon can cut, burn, or otherwise
destroy bundles of para-sympathetic and sympathetic nerves. These nerves
carry pain sensation from the uterus, and scientists believe the nerves are
involved in painful menses. (See Figure 11-3 for an illustration of nerves in the
pelvis.) Because the nerves don’t seem to have any other important function,
such as sexual response, destroying them doesn’t appear to have any other
significant risks.
216
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

What’s involved with LUNA?
A surgeon can perform LUNA via laparotomy or laparoscopy in the following
way:
1. After the surgeon opens the pelvis, the cul-de-sac is exposed.
(See Chapter 3 for a biology recap.)
2. He pushes the intestines out of the way and identifies the uterosacral
ligaments.
The nerves run in the ligament. The ligaments meet and form the ganglion
(group of nerve cells) that attaches to the uterus at the junction of the
cervix.
3. The surgeon uses one of two methods to interrupt these nerves:
• He cuts the uterosacral ligaments where the ligament meets the
uterus.
• He ties off or cauterizes the tissue with electrosurgery or laser to
prevent bleeding (because a blood vessel is there also). He then
cuts the ligament to interrupt the nerve.

Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

Because the ureter runs very close to this area, the surgeon must be careful
that the energy source doesn’t damage it. Bleeding is the other major compli-
cation. The uterine artery and its major branches are nearby. Damage to
them can lead to dangerous bleeding. Surgeons must also be careful not to
injure deeper blood vessels and nerves.
Does LUNA really decrease pain?
Many women wonder if LUNA really works. Good question! As with many pro-
cedures, some surgeons swear by it and some swear at it. Studies suggest that
LUNA may decrease dysmenorrhea in 80 percent of women with the problem.
Although few women get total relief, most women notice some improvement in
their symptoms. Because LUNA is fairly easy and safe and because it requires
no special equipment or skill, many doctors suggest LUNA for women with
painful periods who haven’t responded to traditional methods.
Decreasing endometrial pain:
Presacral neurectomy
Another way of decreasing pain from the pelvis caused by endometriosis is to
interrupt the nerve fibers that carry pain messages from the pelvic organs
and covering. These fibers are part of the sympathetic nerve system; the tiny
nerves come from both sides of the pelvis and form visible nerve fibers on
the surface of the sacrum, hence the term presacral. These nerves don’t have
any other known function, so cutting them only affects pain sensation. For
instance, these nerves don’t affect labor or pushing during childbirth, nor do
they affect sexual response.
What’s involved with presacral neurectomy?
This procedure was only done via laparotomy until recently. Now, skilled
endoscopic surgeons can do it safely and effectively as an outpatient proce-
dure. Still, the surgeon must be careful not to injure the aorta and vena cave
(the biggest blood vessels that take blood away from and to the heart,
respectively) and the plexus of veins on the surface of the sacrum. These
injuries may cause catastrophic bleeding. Injury to the intestines is also a
common complication.
In a presacral neurectomy (PSN), the surgeon
1. Moves the intestines out of the way to expose the covering of the
sacrum at the base of the spine.
This peritoneal covering is part of the peritoneum all over the abdomi-
nal cavity.
218
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

2. Cuts and peels away the peritoneum to see the nerve fibers.
These fibers may be in one bundle or in many separate nerves.
3. Isolates and cuts all of the nerve fibers.
4. Repairs the peritoneum and replaces the intestines.
Does PSN really help decrease pain?
That answer depends on which authorities you believe. Advocates say that
70 to 80 percent of women have relief with the procedure. Detractors say that
the results aren’t nearly that good and the benefit doesn’t justify the risk.
Some reasons PSN isn’t routine are
 The surgery is very difficult and dangerous.
 The anatomy of the nerves is so variable that complete dissection often
isn’t successful.
Incomplete cutting of all the nerves appears to cause the failed surgeries.
Because of the controversy, difficulty of the surgery, and variable results, sur-
geons usually save PSN as a last option.
Opting for Radical Surgery
Unfortunately, some women don’t get enough relief from their endometriosis
with medications or conservative surgery. These women have two choices:
 They can live with the problems and adjust their lifestyle to suit the
disease.
 They can have radical surgery, removing the uterus, ovaries, and
fallopian tubes in the hopes of ending the problem for good.
But even radical surgery isn’t 100 percent effective for ending all the symp-
toms of endometriosis.
“How can this be?” you ask. If a woman has no more ovaries to feed the
implants, no uterus to supply the endometrium, no tubes to transport the dis-
ease, and nothing to stick together, why does she still have problems? Doctors
and researchers don’t really know the reason. A couple of theories include
 The effect of microscopic endometriosis lesions on the peritoneal surface
in the pelvis, on the intestines, or on the bladder
 The metaplasia theory (see Chapter 4), where the cells of the pelvic
lining can change and become endometrial tissue
 The abnormal inflammatory response of immune cells and other media-
tors to the presence of even microscopic disease
219
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

Whatever the reason for incomplete relief from radical surgery, you must be
aware of the possibility and accept this risk. Discuss the expectations, risks,
and benefits with your surgeon before radical surgery (or any treatment for
that matter).
This section looks at the two most common radical surgeries: an oophorec-
tomy (the removal of the ovaries) and a complete hysterectomy. In this sec-
tion we tell you what happens during these procedures and give you the
lowdown on the pros and cons.
Removing your ovaries
In some cases, you and your doctor may elect to remove one or both ovaries
(an oophorectomy) and not the uterus. This decision is unusual but has some
good reasons. Sometimes one ovary keeps forming chocolate cysts and adhe-
sions that cause pain and hormonal changes. When more conservative treat-
ment has failed or the disease has recurred quickly, removing the “bad”
ovary may be beneficial.
Usually this radical surgery isn’t for young women who may want to become
pregnant. However, if one of the ovaries seems more involved (the pain isn’t
in the middle of the pelvis but more on one side or the other), removing that
one ovary (and possibly its fallopian tube) may relieve symptoms. In this
case, at least one ovary remains, so pregnancy is still possible.
Some women don’t want to risk losing all their natural hormones. One ovary
can provide plenty of natural hormones to prevent menopausal symptoms
with the potential problems of osteoporosis and other menopausal problems.
220
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 
Freezing eggs for a possible pregnancy
With the advent of assisted reproductive tech-
nologies (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), sur-
geons may remove both ovaries but leave
the uterus in place. This choice works for
women who need to relieve symptoms from the
ovaries but still want the possibility of carrying
a pregnancy.
Before the surgeon removes the ovaries, a fer-
tility specialist removes the eggs and fertilizes
them and then freezes the embryos. At a later
date, the embryos can be thawed and placed
into her uterus. Recent technical breakthroughs
show that the eggs themselves may be frozen
and fertilized later (see Fertility For Dummies by
Jackie Meyers-Thompson and Sharon Perkins
for more on advances in egg freezing).

Performing an oophorectomy
Surgeons remove one or both ovaries via a laparotomy or laparoscopy. The
route depends on the anatomy, possible distortion of the normal structures,
presence of adhesions, and the judgment of the surgeon. You should discuss
the approach with your doctor before surgery.
To remove an ovary, the surgeon
1. Blocks off its blood supply and cuts some ligaments that suspend the
ovary between the sidewall of the pelvis and the uterus.
2. Cuts other small blood vessels and attachments between the ovary
and tube to free the ovary.
This area has few pain nerves, so the procedure itself isn’t painful; only
the access hurts.
If the surgeon removes the fallopian tube, he uses the same procedure. But
the blood supply is much smaller and easier to coagulate, and the tubes have
no real ligaments (just fairly filmy attachments) to cut.
Although this procedure sounds fairly straightforward, the surgeon must avoid
major arteries in the area and the ureter. Direct damage to these elements or
indirect damage from thermal spread (damage done to adjacent structures by
the energy used) or kinking of the tissue can lead to major complications.
Recovering from oophorectomy
This surgery adds little, if any, discomfort to the incision for access to the
pelvis, so recovery centers on the route, laparotomy or laparoscopy. The
same caveats for recovery that we mention in “Passing through the recovery
phase” earlier in this chapter apply here.
The only major difference with an oophorectomy is the removal of the ovar-
ian hormones and the short- and long-term effects of no estrogen. If both
ovaries are gone, essentially all the estrogen and progesterone producers are
gone too. This absence of estrogen can cause menopausal symptoms within a
few days of the surgery and may last for a variable amount of time, from
months to years. Symptoms usually abate eventually. If they don’t, your
doctor may prescribe hormone replacement, depending on your overall
health history, such as history of heart disease or cancer.
If surgery removes only one ovary, the other ovary may shut down for some
time. As a result, a woman may have the same menopausal symptoms for the
short term. In almost all cases, the remaining ovary begins to make estrogen
quickly. Short-term hormonal replacement can help with these symptoms if
needed.
221
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

Having a hysterectomy
If you’re reading your doctor’s notes as he writes, you may be stymied by the
initials TAH-BSO. This is shorthand for removal of uterus, fallopian tubes, and
ovaries. (TAH-BSO stands for total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salp-
ingo-oophorectomy.)
Most of the time surgery removes the whole uterus, the cervix, and fundus.
Some physicians advocate leaving the cervix to enhance pelvic support and
improve sexual response after surgery. This is called a partial (or supracervi-
cal) hysterectomy. Sometimes, especially in cases of severe adhesions and a
frozen pelvis, the surgeon may leave the cervix for reasons of safety because
it may be dangerous to risk injury to the major blood vessels, intestines,
bladder, or ureter. Occasionally, your doctor decides to leave an ovary in
place (see the previous section for reasons).
Choosing how to approach a hysterectomy
Most surgical procedures, including a hysterectomy, have more than one
approach. Until the advent of laparoscopy, two approaches were common:
the abdominal incision (laparotomy) or a vaginal removal. All three methods
have their advocates. Because no one right choice exists for everyone or every
situation, you and your doctor should discuss the route for your surgery.
Making an incision: The abdominal method
In most cases where the surgery involves removing ovaries, the abdominal
incision allows easier and less risky access for oophorectomy. Even when
a cul-de-sac and other scarring aren’t likely or present, adhesions are likely
around the ovary in cases of endometriosis. In this situation, a vaginal
removal of ovaries is more difficult and dangerous.
A frozen pelvis from severe adhesions makes the abdominal approach a
necessity. The laparotomy has all the same advantages we discuss in “Noting
the treatment advantages of laparotomy to laparoscopy” earlier in this chap-
ter, and it’s often the method of choice for radical surgery. A supracervical
hysterectomy via laparotomy is easier via laparotomy, and all gynecologists
are trained in this approach. The mini-laparotomy (smaller incision) is
another option but offers slightly less access.
Going through the canal: The vaginal method
As the name implies, the surgeon performs a vaginal hysterectomy through
the vagina. Obviously, access is much more limited than with a laparotomy,
and hands and instruments greatly reduce visibility during the procedure.
Because the surgeon can’t really get his hands in to feel for structures, he has
to rely on that limited sight. With many pelvic surgeries, limited access isn’t a
222
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

major problem for the experienced surgeon, but when dealing with
endometriosis, the limitations can become a real disadvantage. As a result,
vaginal hysterectomies are less common for endometriosis because they
offer little access to probable adhesions and distorted anatomy.
Nonetheless, vaginal hysterectomy has advantages. It’s an ideal method for
removal of the fairly normal-sized uterus for benign conditions like fibroids,
adenomyosis (growths in the uterine wall), refractory dysfunctional bleeding,
abnormal Pap smears, and prolapse (collapse of the uterus into the vagina
through the cervix). And because this surgery involves no large abdominal
incisions, recovery is usually quicker than with a laparotomy. Unfortunately,
many younger surgeons aren’t getting enough exposure to this procedure in
training programs, and it’s an underused procedure in gynecology today.
Using new technology: The laparoscopic method
With the development of laparoscopy for hysterectomy, surgery is minimally
invasive and provides better tolerance and recovery for the patient. However,
for patients with endometriosis and severe adhesions — where structures are
stuck together — a laparoscopic approach may not be safe. If the patient has
a possible frozen pelvis, severe adhesions, or a much-distorted anatomy, the
surgeon may initially use laparoscopy to assess the viability of that approach.
But, if he determines that the route isn’t appropriate, he can then convert the
approach to a laparotomy.
The scope offers two ways to perform a hysterectomy. Each method has its
proponents, but your surgeon makes the final decision.
 Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH): This method was
the original laparoscopy. A wise surgeon decided that he could accom-
plish vaginal hysterectomies more easily and safely if he used the
laparoscope. The most difficult part of the vaginal hysterectomy was
getting the upper attachments and blood vessels under control. These
structures (the round ligaments and ovarian arteries) are fairly easy to
tie off, coagulate, and cut via the laparoscope. After this upper work is
complete, the rest of the procedure can proceed vaginally.
This method also allows surgeons to check for adhesions or anatomical
abnormalities and deal with the problems via the scope, under direct
visualization. Likewise, a surgeon can evaluate ovaries and tubes and
then detach them much more effectively through the scope. So, with
only a few tiny incisions on the abdominal wall, LAVH makes vaginal hys-
terectomies a better possibility.
 Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH): This option uses laparoscopy exclu-
sively. As the name implies, the surgeon detaches and removes the uterus
(and tubes and ovaries if necessary) from the pelvis via the laparoscope.
You may wonder how he gets that large uterus (at least the size of a small
pear) out through that tiny incision. Good question! In the LAVH, the sur-
geon takes the uterus out through the vagina. If a baby can fit, then a
223
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

uterus is a piece of cake! With LH, as soon as the surgeon has secured the
blood vessels and cut the support structures, he can extricate the uterus,
tubes, and ovaries through the laparoscopic incision.
Your surgeon has two ways to remove the organs:
• He can enlarge one of the incisions to afford removal of the organs.
This may seem somewhat self-defeating because the advantage of
an LH is the small incisions. Why not just take the uterus out
through the vagina? Two reasons: The uterus may be too big (not
usual with endometriosis), or the surgeon performed a supracervi-
cal hysterectomy, which offers no opening to the vagina because
the cervix is left in place.
• He can morcelate (shred) the uterus, tubes, and ovaries into pieces
less than a centimeter with an instrument (powered or manual)
and then remove the tissue through the normal-size incisions.
Because these instruments can cause inadvertent damage, the sur-
geon must be careful to avoid injury to other organs, such as the
intestines or major blood vessels. The other potential problem is
that the organs are in pieces, which can make microscopic diagno-
sis more difficult and can leave other diseases undiagnosed (such
as cancer, in the worst-case scenario).
Whichever route your surgeon takes, the two of you must be on the same
page. Discuss these options, and be sure that you’re comfortable with your
doctor’s suggestion.
Recovering from hysterectomy
Recovery from a hysterectomy depends on the method. With LH, your recov-
ery is about the same as any other laparoscopy. However, when the surgeon
has cut ligaments and other attachments to the uterus, the surgery injures a
larger area of tissue. As a result, patients usually have a bit more pain and
discomfort with LH than with other laparoscopic procedures.
On the other end of the spectrum is the recovery from a laparotomy (see the
earlier section “Recovering from laparotomy”); the removal of the uterus
adds some to the discomfort, but most of the pain is incision-related.
The pain level after a vaginal hysterectomy falls between the pain levels of
the other two approaches. In this case, the surgeon has removed the same
organs, but you have less pain and can return to activity more quickly
because you have no abdominal incision. However, this procedure causes
224
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

more vaginal discomfort because the retractors and other instruments in
the vagina and pelvis can cause swelling and inflammation. These conditions
add to the pain and discomfort, but not as much as a laparotomy does.
If your surgeon removed your ovaries, the loss of hormones can bring on
menopausal symptoms. Check out “Recovering from oophorectomy” earlier
in this chapter for more info.
Complications may prolong recovery from hysterectomy. Some of these are
common and not severe, including
 Urinary tract infection (due to the catheter in the bladder)
 Bowel dysfunction
 Wound infection from skin bacteria
 Atelectasis (collapse of some air pockets in the lung)
 Pneumonia
 Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs or pelvis)
 Bleeding
The chance of any one of these complications increases with the length and
route of surgery. Laparotomy is most likely to cause complications;
laparoscopy is least likely.
Follow all post-operative instructions to minimize the risk of these problems. If
you have frequent, difficult, or painful urination, try to drink fluids, and let your
doctor know whether the problem persists. Deep breathing may be painful, but
it is essential to prevent lung problems. And getting out of bed and moving
around can help your bowels work, your lungs fill, and your veins stay free of
clots. All of these preventive measures can make your recovery smoother.
Inform your surgeon immediately if you have
 A cough (especially if you cough up blood) or breathing problems
 Shortness of breath
 Constipation or diarrhea
 Pain in the legs (especially the calves)
 Chest pain
 Increasing (rather than decreasing) abdominal pain or redness and pain
in the incision
 Fever after surgery (more than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit)
225
Chapter 11: Contemplating Surgery to Improve Your Endometriosis

Making the Right Surgical Choice
Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may start with conservative
surgery, such as a hysteroscopy or a dilation and curettage (D&C). Or your
initial surgery for endometriosis may be a diagnostic laparoscope so your
doctor can take a look around your pelvis and possibly remove endometrial
implants. But if you’ve already had diagnostic surgery, you may decide to
have a more radical treatment that’s based on previous results.
After you and your doctor decide to have surgery, you need to choose the
proper approach. Your doctor will undoubtedly have preferences based on
his findings and will guide you on the pros and cons of all the alternatives.
Unfortunately, surgery isn’t always a miracle cure. In some circumstances,
surgery may be too risky because it’s unsafe for you or because it can do more
harm than good. For example, to preserve your chances of getting pregnant,
your doctor doesn’t want to interfere with your ovaries. But some times the
surgeon does everything possible, and the patient still has symptoms or still
can’t get pregnant. No surgeon is perfect, and no procedure is guaranteed to
work.
In the end, you and your doctor have to make the decisions about surgery;
if he seems to be proposing one type of surgery over another, ask him why.
Many offices today have videos you can watch about different types of surgery
and their risks and benefits; offices that don’t offer this usually have written
information you can take home and mull over at your leisure. Rarely is surgery
for endometriosis a life-or-death decision, so take the time to really understand
what’s involved before making a surgical decision.

N
ever before have so many people looked for alternatives to traditional
Western medicine — herbs, acupuncture, Eastern medicine, and other
alternatives are all getting a close look. But you may be asking: Why the pop-
ularity of alternative treatments? After all, traditional medicine today is as
advanced as it’s ever been and improving all the time. So why are so many
people looking for alternative treatments?
Part of the reason is that traditional Western medicine focuses on illness,
devoting far more time to curing disease than to preventing it. Alternative treat-
ments tend to focus on integrating the mind, body, and spirit in treatment and
prevention. More people today are aware of the mind’s influence on health and
want to incorporate an integral approach into their treatment. Sometimes tradi-
tional medicine doesn’t have the answers you’re looking for. When your doctor
says, “There’s not much more we can do for you,” you may decide to look to
nontraditional methods to decrease pain or treat endometriosis.
This chapter looks more closely at alternative treatments and remedies,
including those that rely more on the mind-body connection and those that
utilize hands-on treatment, like massage and chiropractic.

Being Aware of Alternative 
Medicine Pitfalls
Because alternative medicine isn’t as stringently regulated as traditional med-
icine, you need to be on your guard against undertrained and improperly
trained practitioners, as well as outright snake oil salesmen. Although many
alternative treatments have become almost mainstream in their acceptance
by the general public and medical personnel and have strict guidelines for
practice, others have little in the way of regulation to make sure that practi-
tioners are consistent and effective.
For this reason, you must remember one caveat above all others when choos-
ing alternative medical treatment: Consumer, beware! Pursuing alternative
medicine treatments can have potentially serious drawbacks. This section
looks at those drawbacks.
Finding a competent practitioner
Be sure the practitioner you choose is licensed if the treatment has a licens-
ing procedure. Many alternative treatments, such as acupuncture and chiro-
practic, have strict criteria for licensure. Finding a practitioner that uses
techniques outside mainstream medicine can be more challenging than find-
ing a traditional medical doctor. One of the drawbacks to alternative thera-
pies is that licensing of practitioners isn’t as stringent as the licensing of
medical doctors, so you may not know whether your practitioner has had
adequate training. A well-intentioned but untrained practitioner can do a lot
more harm than good!
In order to find a competent practitioner, we recommend you start with the
governing boards or licensing bodies of the professions that have them, such
as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), naturopathy, or acupuncture, to
name a few. (We list the governing bodies of many alternative treatments in
the sections describing them.) If you want to find out or you’re unsure
whether a profession is regulated, a number of sources can help.
 The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
(NCCAM), which is associated with the National Institute of Health
(NIH), is a good place to start. The NCCAM provides an amazing amount
of information on alternative treatments, including licensure informa-
tion, clinical trial updates, and articles on finding an alternative practi-
tioner. They don’t make physician referrals, however. The NCCAM even
has an online chat with a health information specialist Monday through
Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST. You can reach the NCCAM at

can reach the FDA by phone at 888-723-3366.
After you find a regulated profession and need to find a practitioner, you can
use the same criteria for finding a practitioner that we suggest in Chapter 8
for finding a doctor.
If the treatment you’re considering isn’t regulated, finding a practitioner is
more difficult. You may have to rely on two methods: asking friends and
acquaintances for references and listening to your gut. It’s important not to
sign up for anything until you’ve met with your potential practitioner in
person and asked some of the following questions. The answers you get may
give you a feeling for whether or not this practitioner is knowledgeable in his
or her field.
Meet with your potential practitioner before you start working with her for a
“get to know you” appointment. Doing so is especially important if there’s no
licensing board to check with. Make sure you ask her the following questions:
 What are your qualifications? What kind of training have you had and for
how long? Where was your training done?
 How many years have you been in practice?
 Are you associated with a recognized professional organization, and are
you listed as a member in good standing?
 Is treatment covered by health insurance?
 How much will treatment cost?
 How long will treatment take?
 What kind of results can I expect?
 Do you have any patients who would be willing to talk to me about their
successful treatment?
Asking these questions can help you make an informed decision about the
qualifications of the practitioner you’re considering.

Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Protecting yourself from dangerous 
(or useless) pills
Many people think that herbs and food supplements in health food stores
can’t possibly be harmful. This assumption isn’t true — deaths from herbal
preparations have occurred and are documented. Many herbs are powerful,
especially if you mix and match without guidance from a professional. Most
employees at your local health store are undertrained (if trained at all) in the
products and possible interactions and are no more a professional than you
are, although you may find exceptions.
One problem with alternative therapies that use food supplements, herbs,
vitamins, and other natural medicines is that no governing body has scientifi-
cally studied or compared most of them to more traditional treatments or
placebos (compounds that don’t contain any active ingredients). You can’t
verify what’s in that bottle of natural medicines, herbs, supplements, or vita-
mins that you buy. The amount of medication in each dose may vary from
bottle to bottle or even dose to dose. Furthermore, many of these herbs and
food supplements contain added ingredients that have effects such as anti-
inflammatory drugs and amphetamines. These added ingredients — not the
herb — may actually be the source of your relief. Many herbs also stimulate
the immune system; some herbs can make other diseases worse. Evening
primrose oil, for example, can increase the risk of seizure activity. These
important facts are almost never on the label.
In contrast, pharmaceutical companies that sell traditional medicines must
complete very thorough studies, governed by the FDA, that establish the
dose and quantify the benefits and risks. The FDA also makes sure that each
dose is uniform and that the substance is pure, with no contaminants.
We’re not just two people from the traditional medical world bad-mouthing
the alternatives. Far from it. We’ve used alternative treatments with patients
and ourselves. But independent agencies have tested many over-the-counter
(OTC) vitamins and supplements and have shown wide variations in doses
and potencies — even in compounds manufactured according to United
States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards. Strict scientific studies on some forms
of natural therapy, notably those for menopause, have found that these thera-
pies are no more effective than placebos.
If you’re seriously considering alternative treatments, first check with your
primary care physician. You also need to keep the following pointers in mind:
 Be sure that you only use products from reputable companies or
stores, and get your information on supplements from people who
know their product well. Small stores that have been in business for
years often have knowledgeable owners who are passionate about sup-
plements. The local big box vitamin store, on the other hand, is more
230
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

likely to hire people who need a job, not people who know — or care —
about supplements. This rule isn’t hard and fast; you may find an
extremely knowledgeable salesperson at a large chain store. Ask the
person you’re taking advice from how long she’s worked in the store,
and what her training is before you load hundreds of dollars worth of
supplements into your cart.
 If you find a product that works for you, use it under supervision 
of a trained professional. He can ensure that you’re taking the product
correctly.
 Ask questions of any practitioner that suggests a treatment. Ask ques-
tions about the efficacy, safety, quality, and potency of the therapy.
 Search reference sources about studies on these products. Try to find
legitimate studies that test many women (at least a hundred in each
group, not just a few) and that compare the therapy to a placebo or
other documented therapy. NCCAM has information on many clinical
trials that have been done with alternative therapies.
If you can’t get answers from the professionals or references about these
therapies, then be wary. The products may do more harm than good and cost
you dearly in the long run.
Accessing Acupuncture
You may be familiar with acupuncture, the art of inserting fine, sterile needles
into different areas of the body for treatment of any number of disorders.
Acupuncture, which is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), came into
use in the United States in the 1970s and is often used for pain relief. Some
traditional medical doctors now train in the use of acupuncture. TCM
acupuncturists often combine treatments with the use of herbs.
This section looks more closely at how acupuncture can help ease your
endometriosis pain and how you can find a licensed acupuncturist.
Easing the pain with just a little prick
Are you looking for a little extra pain relief from your endometriosis?
Acupuncture may be an option. Acupuncture and herbal medicines are fre-
quent treatments for endometriosis and other pelvic disorders. These herbal
medicines include plant elements, such as roots, barks, flowers, and fruits,
and the formulas prescribed vary from person to person. Common acupunc-
ture points in the treatment of endometriosis are the ears, abdomen, wrists,
feet, legs, and back. Needles remain in place for 20 to 45 minutes.
231
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

So how does acupuncture really work? An acupuncturist inserts needles into
certain points on your body to stimulate nerve endings and release endor-
phins (neurotransmitters) that have pain-relieving qualities. You may need up
to six treatments before you feel significant pain relief.
Some of the goals of acupuncture and herbal medicines are to break up stag-
nation of blood by moving blood from one place to another, thus stopping 
the pain. Each point of needle placement and herb has its own therapeutic
importance in the treatment of endometriosis depending on the TCM diagno-
sis of the individual.
If you’re needle-phobic, don’t rule out acupuncture altogether. The needles
are about the width of a human hair; insertion is far less uncomfortable than
your average blood test.
Finding a licensed acupuncturist
Acupuncture became an officially recognized treatment for pain by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1997, so you can find a physician trained
in acupuncture more easily now than even ten years ago. Physicians can be
certified in acupuncture after taking a 200- to 300-hour training course. They’re
then members of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (AAMA).
The FDA regulates acupuncture needles and tools, so standards are high but
the FDA doesn’t regulate the practitioner, so be careful. You can get a listing
of medical doctors in your area who perform acupuncture by contacting the
AAMA at its toll-free number at 800-521-2262 or by searching its Web site at
www.medicalacupuncture.org.
Acupuncture-trained physicians are licensed or certified through the National
Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. To confirm
your practitioner’s certifications, check out the NCCAOM’s Web site at www.
nccaom.org.
Considering a Chiropractor
Millions of people visit a chiropractor each year, and many make regular
visits. According to the Annals of Internal Medicine, chiropractic is the
largest, most regulated, and best recognized of the complementary and alter-
native medicine professions. Doctors of Chiropractic have at least four years
of post college education at accredited chiropractic schools and must pass
boards to be licensed to practice.
232
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Understanding what a chiropractor does
Chiropractic physicians use hands-on manipulation, called chiropractic adjust-
ment, of muscles and joints (particularly in and around the spinal column) to
treat a number of diseases and to decrease pain by restoring mobility to tis-
sues that have become restricted in their movement, causing inflammation
and pain. Because pain from endometriosis can involve the back and the
nerves that run from the spinal column to the pelvis, chiropractic manipula-
tion may decrease its pain.
Chiropractors use more than 20 different techniques to manipulate tissues.
You can go to two different chiropractors and have two completely different
experiences depending on their individual approach to manipulation. You
can find a good explanation of commonly used chiropractic techniques
online at www.becomehealthynow.com/category/chirotechniques/.
Finding a chiropractor
You may think finding a chiropractor is fairly easy because most strip malls
and office complexes seem to have a chiropractor’s office. As easy as these
offices may be to find, we still suggest you follow the Chapter 8 guidelines for
finding a good doctor when you’re looking for a chiropractor. Take the time
to meet with your prospective chiropractor and ask him about his training
and methods. (For example, chiropractors use different manipulation meth-
ods, some of which may be more painful for you.) Ask if he’s treated other
patients with endometriosis, and what results you can realistically expect.
Many chiropractors will want to see you on a regular basis, such as once or
twice a week. Some insurance companies will pay for chiropractic visits. You
can verify a chiropractor’s certification by visiting the National Board of
Chiropractic Examiners’ Web site at http://www.nbce.org/.
Using Heat and Massage for Pain Relief
Sometimes simple methods work well for relieving pain. Heat can be a great
muscle relaxer. Sometimes just soaking in a warm tub or resting with a heat-
ing pad or hot water bottle can relieve pain. Some heating pads supply moist
heat, which can be even more effective than dry heat.
You can also make your own packs by warming slightly dampened towels in
the microwave. Remember that microwaves don’t apply heat evenly, and
make sure the towel doesn’t get too hot in one spot; you could end up with a
painful burn in addition to your other aches and pains. One advantage of
using warm towels is that you can mold them to your aching areas, which is
difficult to do with commercial heating pads.
233
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Massage can be a great way to lessen your endometriosis pain, even if the
relief’s only temporary. You can also use massage therapy to decrease pain,
relax muscles, and relieve tension. The following types of massage may 
help you:
 Acupressure applies pressure to specific trigger points to release ten-
sion in muscle fibers.
 Deep-tissue massage applies pressure to connective tissue and muscles
to release tension.
 Shiatsu is a form of acupressure that combines pressure on trigger
points with long strokes, stretching, and manipulation.
 Swedish massage uses long firm strokes on heavily muscled areas and
softer strokes on more delicate tissues to release stress and relax tense
muscles.
Some massage therapists may incorporate aromatherapy (see the section
“Breathing Your Way to Feeling Better: Aromatherapy” later in this chapter
for more info) into the massage because the body absorbs these essential
oils through massage. As a result, you get two benefits for the price of one.
If you’re choosing a massage therapist, look for someone who has graduated
from an accredited school (accredited by the Commission for Massage
Training Accreditation [COMTA]) and is a member of the American Massage
Therapy Association or the Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals.
You can find Web sites listing members at www.amtmassage.org or www.
abmp.org.
Some malls and airports have massage therapists set up so you can shop and
then drop onto the table for some relaxation, but make sure the person doing
your massage is a trained therapist. Furthermore, some nationwide clinics
claim to offer a unique, deep, external and internal massage technique that
can break down scar tissue. This therapy is expensive, unproven, and can be
harmful. Always discuss this sort of therapy with your regular doctor and
follow his recommendation; he knows your scar tissue better than anybody!
Relying on Relaxation Techniques
Your mind is a powerful tool. In fact, several mind-body therapies rely on
mind over matter — the idea that you can overcome or control physical sen-
sations, such as pain, with mental effort to actually reduce pain. This type of
therapy can be a valuable part of treatment for pain because it’s nonaddic-
tive, has no unpleasant side effects, and gives you the sense of controlling
your own body. The following different techniques use your mind to over-
come pain:
234
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Biofeedback teaches you how to use your body’s response to decrease
pain and stress through a technique called positive reinforcement. Often
the technique begins with the use of a machine that records your heart
rate and other vital signs as they change in response to stimuli.
Eventually you understand how to respond positively to pain by relaxing
muscles, breathing deeply and slowly, and using visual imagery or posi-
tive thoughts to distract you from the pain.
 Guided imagery helps you relax tense muscles by using visual images of
places that you find peaceful and relaxing. You can also use this tech-
nique in conjunction with music therapy.
 Hypnosis puts you into a trance state of extreme suggestibility and relax-
ation. A therapist can show you how to use a type of self-hypnosis that
is similar to relaxation training.
 Meditation can calm and focus the mind. This therapy promotes relax-
ation by using two principles:
• Focusing repetitively on a word, sound, phrase, sensation, prayer,
or even muscular activity.
• Developing a passive attitude toward any intrusions and then
returning to the focus.
 Mindfulness training is a meditation technique aimed at reducing stress
and decreasing pain by increasing awareness of the present moment.
 Music therapy can combine relaxing music with relaxation therapy to
decrease anxiety and reduce tension.
 Relaxation training enables you to relax tense muscles and reduce anxi-
ety that can intensify pain.
 Religion and prayer, along with any spiritual beliefs, may work for some
people. Though controversial and hard to prove, a study by Johns
Hopkins showed that people who are more spiritual are also more able
to cope with chronic diseases. The study didn’t show any improvement
in the disease, but the more spiritual patients were happier and felt
better about themselves and their health.
 Spas and balneotherapy have treated chronic pain syndromes for cen-
turies. Balneotherapy (bathing in hot mineral water) has a reputation as
a healing technique. Although no scientific research exists, both prac-
tices can relax and soothe pain.
Stretching with Yoga and T’ai Chi
People have practiced yoga and T’ai Chi for centuries. Although their original
purpose was to improve the mind-body-spirit connection, yoga and T’ai Chi
are most popular in the United States for their combination of gentle and con-
trolled movements that provide a no- or low-impact workout for people in
235
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

almost any physical condition. These exercises can ease tense muscles,
reduce pain, improve flexibility, and enhance a person’s strength, balance,
and endurance.
This section uncovers where you can find out more about yoga and T’ai Chi
and explains how these two arts can benefit you and ease your endometrio-
sis pain.
Finding out more about yoga and T’ai Chi
Yoga and T’ai Chi are gentle enough for almost everyone, and they’re adapt-
able to your physical level. Nearly every college, gym, hospital, YMCA, and
neighborhood recreation center offers some type of yoga or T’ai Chi instruc-
tion. Most classes are relatively inexpensive and may be covered under your
health plan if your doctor prescribes them.
If you want to find a program, check out www.yogafinder.com or www.
taichinetwork.org. You can take group classes or have individual instruc-
tion (definitely more pricey). Books and DVDs can also guide you through the
movements of yoga and T’ai Chi at home, which is helpful if you don’t feel
like reaching for all those positions in front of a dozen strangers. Keep in
mind, though, that the home schooling approach is harder without a few
lessons from a pro first. Yoga For Dummies by Georg Feuerstein and Larry
Payne (Wiley) and T’ai Chi For Dummies by Therese Iknoian (Wiley) are good
starts if you want more information before signing up for a class.
Finding a qualified instructor isn’t always easy because just about anyone
with a correspondence course under her belt can call herself a yoga instruc-
tor. Yoga Alliance, a teacher-organized group, recommends at least 200 hours
of expert training to qualify as a yoga instructor. At the last count, 8,000
instructors in the United States have met that standard. So finding a qualified
instructor near you should be easy.
Looking closer at the benefits 
of yoga and T’ai Chi
The pain of endometriosis often causes tense muscles, which makes overall
pain even worse. Gentle stretching and controlled movements like those per-
formed in yoga and T’ai Chi can help relax muscles, decreasing pain.
Yoga’s and T’ai Chi’s benefits include
 Stress reduction
 Relaxation
236
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Improved circulation
 Improved muscle tone
 Enhanced cardiovascular health
One school of thought proposes that progesterone receptors stop function-
ing in the presence of adrenaline, the stress hormone. When that happens,
you may have an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone effects that can
increase symptoms of endometriosis. Calming exercises can relieve stress
and facilitate more balanced hormones. Relaxing with yoga, for example, can
calm and relax you. When you’re more relaxed, you may not notice your
endometriosis symptoms as much as if you were stressed.
Using a TENS Unit
A Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) unit uses electrical
impulses to block pain signals. Electrodes — on your skin near the pain —
transmit a mild electrical current through the skin, blocking the sensation of
pain for several hours. TENS units cost around $100, and the electrodes run
around $30 for a pack of four. Electrodes are good for 15 to 30 uses. TENS
units run on batteries, and most are small enough to hook to your belt, so
you can keep moving while you’re wearing one. Patients control the unit by
turning it on and off; some units can be programmed for a pre-set amount of
time, such as 30 minutes.
Use a TENS only under the supervision of your doctor or physical therapist;
your insurance company may reimburse the cost as long as you have a pre-
scription. You can also rent a TENS unit before buying one to make sure it
helps you with your pain. Many medical companies let you rent one for a
month and apply the rental fee to the purchase price if you decide to buy the
unit.
If you have a pacemaker, a TENS unit may interfere with your pacemaker. Talk
to your doctor before considering a TENS unit.
Trying Traditional Chinese Medicine
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) categorizes endometriosis as a blood
stasis disease with formation of lumps. The Chinese name for endometriosis is
actually neiyi, meaning internal lump. TCM relates blood stasis in the lower
abdomen to back and pelvic pain. In addition, qi stagnation (restricted blood
flow due to emotional distress) and coldness (decreased metabolism and 
circulation — sometimes called kidney yang deficiency) cause the blood stasis.
237
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Since 1979, Chinese researchers have studied endometriosis extensively,
especially in Shanghai. This research has centered on basic herbal prepara-
tions used to treat qi (the basic problem in endometriosis). The Chinese
believe the mixture revitalizes blood flow and, as a result, minimizes the
symptoms.
In the 1800s, TCM physician Wang Quingren, forerunner of endometriosis
treatment in China, developed two blood-vitalizing formulas for the lower
body that are still widely used in TCM today. One formula is Shaofu Zhuyu
Tang (shaofu means lower palace) and the other formula is Gexia Zhuyu Tang
(ge means diaphragm, while xia means below). The two formulas are similar
and contain many of the herbs listed in Table 12-1.

If you’re combining the methods of a TCM practitioner with traditional
Western medicine, make sure all your caretakers know what you’re doing!
Trying to mix and match treatments is a good way to end up in trouble; herbs
and supplements from health food stores or TCM practitioners can be every
bit as potent as medicine from your local pharmacy — mixing the two can
cause serious side effects.
So how do these herbs work? Researchers believe they may increase blood
flow and give a boost to the immune system.
Considering Herbal Medicines
Herbalists, homeopaths, and naturopaths also use herbs to treat diseases,
including endometriosis. Herbalists use herbs to strengthen the immune
system and restore health, homeopaths use minute amounts of minerals to
cure disease, and naturopaths use a natural, balanced approach of herbs and
dietary changes to allow the body to heal itself. This section looks at these
more in-depth and identifies how each one treats endometriosis.
Trying an herbalist
Herbalists use herbs to rebalance the hormone levels in the body and
strengthen the immune system. Herbalists tend to associate endometriosis
with a variety of causes, such as emotional stress, anxiety, constitutional
weakness, surgical history, exposure to cold temperatures during menstrua-
tion, diet, chronic illness or weakness, or a history of genital infections, so
they prescribe specific herbs depending on each person’s unique history. If
you’re looking for a qualified herbalist, check out the Web site www.yinyang
house.com/directory/ for a list of practitioners.

Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Although modern medicine may criticize the use of herbs, plants and herbs
historically are at the root (pun intended) of today’s most-accepted medi-
cines. So, even though modern medicine uses plant and herb extractions,
herbalists advocate the use of the whole plant rather than laboratory-
purified products.
Some of these herbs and their purposes include the following:
 Chamomile flower reduces inflammation.
 Ginger root relaxes muscles.
 Goldenseal relaxes uterine muscles and decreases abnormal bleeding.
 Motherwort reduces pelvic congestion.
 Red raspberry reduces pelvic congestion.
 Red root reduces pelvic congestion.
 Shepherd’s purse helps decrease abnormal menstrual bleeding.
 Squaw vine reduces pelvic congestion.
 Turska’s formula decreases pain.
 Vitex, also called chaste tree berry, helps balance estrogen and 
progesterone.
Working with a homeopath
Homeopaths administer diluted plant, animal, and mineral derivatives to help
an individual’s body to correct the illness. Homeopathic medicine’s premise
is like cures like, which means that the medicine must cause symptoms simi-
lar to the disease in order to cure it.
Homeopathic treatment of endometriosis is individualized. At one time, it was
quite mainstream; in 1900, one out of five doctors in the United States prac-
ticed homeopathy. However, it lost popularity as medical science and educa-
tion advanced. Some medical doctors today can also be licensed homeopathic
physicians. If you’re looking for a homeopathic practitioner, or just want to
know more about homeopathy, check out www.homeopathic.org/
find.htm for a list of practitioners and tons of other info.
The FDA regulates the homeopathic medications manufactured by estab-
lished pharmaceutical companies under strict guidelines. The dosages
involved in homeopathic drugs are minute, so minute that detractors say
they can’t possibly be of any benefit. Homeopaths, however, believe that only
a tiny amount of a substance is necessary to cure illnesses with symptoms
similar to those the drug produces.
240
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

The following medications are common recommendations by homeopaths for
endometriosis:
 Belladonna for menstruation with sensation of heaviness and heat
 Calcarea phosphoricum for excessive periods with backache
 Chamomilla for heavy menses with dark, clotted blood and pains
 Cimicifuga racemosa for unbearable pain radiating from hip to hip
Seeing a naturopath
Naturopathic medicine uses herbal remedies, diet, hydrotherapy, and lifestyle
changes; it emphasizes the body’s “God-given” ability to heal itself in the
proper environment. Naturopathy is also about maintaining wellness and
relieving stress (from mental, nutritional, environmental, or physical factors)
without pharmacologic medications. Approximately 1,500 naturopathic
physicians practice in the United States.
Naturopathy emphasizes the body’s power to heal itself. Developed in the late
19th century, naturopathy regards the body’s natural state as one of equilib-
rium, which an unhealthy lifestyle can disturb. Naturopathic doctors (NDs)
look for underlying causes of a problem instead of treating symptoms alone.
Endometriosis treatment in naturopathic medicine involves a holistic
approach to all areas of a patient’s lifestyle, including diet, cleansing, and
hormone-balancing herbs. Treatment may also include herbs for pain relief
and external preparations to clear toxicity in the abdominal area.
Several accredited naturopathic schools are located in North America; pro-
grams consist of four years post-graduate education. In some states, a State
Board of Examiners licenses and regulates naturopaths, requiring applicants
to pass a national or state board examination. Several naturopathic profes-
sional organizations also require the candidate to pass a proficiency test in
naturopathy in order to join their organization. You can find an accredited ND
at www.findnd.com or www.naturopath.org.
Breathing Your Way to Feeling 
Better: Aromatherapy
Aromatherapy may sound like it belongs on the perfume counter, but this
approach isn’t just about sniffing different odors. Aromatherapy utilizes the
essential oils of plants both for their scent and for their medicinal properties.
These aromatic oils can be extracted from the seeds, bark, leaves, flowers,
wood, roots, or resin of a plant.
241
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Experts don’t see aromatherapy as a cure for endometriosis but as an aid to
strengthening the body’s immune system to heal itself. Some of the oils for
endometriosis, touted to decrease adhesions and help heal the body, include
the following:
 Chamomile soothes, relaxes, acts as an analgesic, and reduces spasms.
 Jasmine soothes, relaxes, acts as an antidepressant, and reduces
spasms.
 Lavender calms, acts as an anti-inflammatory, and reduces spasms.
 Oils of rose relaxes, acts as an antidepressant, and reduces spasms.
You may want to consult with an aromatherapy expert in your area; ask your
local health food store for the names of knowledgeable people. Just remem-
ber that aromatherapy isn’t a state-licensed or regulated practice.
Considering Immunotherapy
Many doctors already use immune therapy in cancer patients as well as
patients with autoimmune disease, a category it seems endometriosis may
fall into. (See Chapter 4 for more on the immune system and endometriosis.)
242
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 
The link between the immune system 
and endometriosis
Can immune therapy help decrease endometrio-
sis? The following three areas of research may
support the idea of immune treatment for
endometriosis:
 Implants of endometriosis cause increased
peritoneal fluid, which contains increased
numbers of immune cells (leukocytes and
others). These cells release chemical sub-
stances (cytokines) that may help endome-
trial implants grow, cause adhesion
formation, reduce fertility, and increase fre-
quency of miscarriages.
 New 
research 
shows 
women 
with
endometriosis often have increased autoan-
tibody levels, suggesting that endometrio-
sis is an autoimmune disease. Common
systemic symptoms like cyclic headaches,
ovulation dysfunction, recurrent flu-like
syndromes, joint pain, chronic fatigue, irri-
table bowel symptoms, and possible
increased rate of miscarriage may be
caused by the increase in autoantibody
levels.
 Research may link the female sex hormones
(estrogen and progesterone), testosterone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing
hormone to the immune system. Hormonal
and menstrual cycle irregularities are
common with endometriosis.

A normal immune system checks the growth of endometrial tissue outside
the endometrial cavity, just like it would check the growth of any neoplastic
(new or tumor) cells found where they don’t belong. However, most women
with endometriosis may have malfunctioning immune systems that don’t
destroy stray endometrial cells before they have a chance to take up resi-
dence. Most immune therapy involves intravenous infusions or injections of
medications that stimulate the immune system to reject and destroy tumors
and growths. This section briefly looks at a few treatment options.
Naming the two main treatment options
Immune therapy is successful with other types of autoimmune disease, and
because of the link of endometriosis to autoimmune diseases, researchers
suggest that immune therapy may work against endometriosis. Because the
FDA hasn’t approved any of these more aggressive treatments for endometrio-
sis, we include them in this chapter. The two main treatments include
 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG is a sterile protein prepara-
tion derived from human blood, given intravenously. IVIG is being used
in other autoimmune disorders with some success, but some studies
have found no real benefit to IVIG. The biggest problem with this treat-
ment is the cost, $2,500 to $4,000 per treatment, which most insurance
companies don’t cover because IVIG isn’t approved for use in
endometriosis.
IVIG comes from the same blood pool used for transfusions, so it’s quite
safe, because these products are specially treated to filter out and kill
viruses. The IVIG products available in the United States and the United
Kingdom have, according to manufacturers, not resulted in a single HIV
transmission in more than 2 million administrations.
 Pentoxifylline (Trental): Trental is an oral medication that normalizes
the activity of a wide range of immune cells that may contribute to
endometriosis. One study done by Dr. Michael Vernon in Kentucky found
that Trental treatment caused endometriosis to shrink in animals, and a
study in Spain showed the pregnancy rate for women treated with
Trental was 31 percent compared to 18 percent for women treated with
placebo (sugar pills).
Trental has an advantage over IVIG because it’s fairly inexpensive, is
taken by mouth, and less than 1 percent of patients report noticeable
side effects. Tell your doctor you’re taking this medication before any
type of surgery, including dental surgery, because increased bleeding is
a possible side effect.
243
Chapter 12: Considering Alternative Therapies and Remedies to Relieve the Pain

Considering biologic response modifiers
Medications called biologic response modifiers, such as adalimumab (Humira),
infliximab (Remicade), and etanercept (Enbrel), have been used for many
autoimmune diseases, but are still under investigation for endometriosis.
Biologic response modifiers inhibit cytokines, which decrease pain and
inflammation.
These drugs are expensive and must be given intravenously or by injection.
They may also increase the risk of infections. Some can have a bad effect on
the neurological system, making them unacceptable for use in some patients.

C
hronic pain can drive you to despair. When you suffer from acute pain,
say from a bad infection, you know it will eventually end and you’ll feel
better. But chronic pain gives you no such assurances. You can only hope the
pain lessens after treatment or that some medication can keep it at bay.
Even with the treatments your doctor gives you, permanently defeating the
pain of endometriosis may take a long time. But defeating pain one day at a
time may be possible, although you need patience to figure out what combi-
nation of drugs, exercise, or therapy works for you. Pain from endometriosis
can occur at different times in your cycle and in different places in your body.
You can look at your progress by keeping a detailed diary of your pain, your
symptoms, and your treatments. (See Chapters 2 and 10 for more on keeping
a diary.)
Keep track of the medications you’ve tried and what works best for you.
Some days you may find one medication works better, some days another,
depending on your symptoms. You’ll never remember what worked best if
you don’t write it down though!
In this chapter, we tell you how to keep the pain of endometriosis under con-
trol as much as is humanly possible. We cover the different types of over-the-
counter (OTC) medications and prescription drugs as well as other methods
that can help you manage the pain.

Defining Chronic Pain
Chronic pain is difficult to understand. Often the pain continues long after
the original injury has healed, leaving other people to wonder why you’re not
better. For example, “Didn’t your surgery fix all that?” is a typical attitude
from uneducated family and friends.
So what exactly is chronic pain?
 Pain that may not have a definable cause
 Pain that continues for longer than six months
 Pain that may not respond well to conventional medical therapies
What’s the first step to decreasing pain? Know your enemy. (Read Part I to
get the lowdown on endometriosis and how it affects your body.)
The next step? Know what works for you. Everyone responds differently to
pain medication, and chronic pain can change the way you respond to med-
ications that you may have used effectively in the past. When pain becomes
chronic, you may need to increase the dose of medications you take, try new
medications, or move up to prescription-strength medications.
Self-Medicating with 
Over-the-Counter Meds
Drugstores can be deceiving. With so many medications on the shelf, surely
some medicine can help, right? The trouble with OTC medications for pain is
that many of them have the same ingredients — just different packaging with
different names by different companies — so the varieties of medicine aren’t
as diverse as they first seem.
This section helps you identify the two main types of OTC painkillers and
then discusses a few pointers you need to consider when taking an OTC 
medicine to battle your pain.
Comparing the types of OTC painkillers
When you’re walking the aisles of your neighborhood pharmacy, you basi-
cally can choose from two types of OTC pain medicines, or analgesics. You
have acetaminophen, better known as Tylenol, which relieves pain but doesn’t
246
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

decrease inflammation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which
include aspirin and newer NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen, which relieve both pain
and inflammation. We discuss all the options in the next sections.
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol, is the most common OTC analgesic in the
United States. Acetaminophen relieves pain and reduces fever but doesn’t
decrease inflammation or inhibit platelet function. For this reason, it doesn’t
cause stomach irritation or increase bleeding tendencies. Although it’s very
safe when taken in recommended dosages, overdoses can result in fatal liver
disease.
Acetaminophen is often sold as a prescription drug in combination with
opioid medications, available only by a prescription for stronger pain. You
can buy the medicine OTC in 325 milligram and 500 milligram tablets and it
can be safely taken in doses up to 1,000 milligrams four times a day.
Because acetaminophen doesn’t cause the stomach upset and bleeding 
problems common to aspirin and NSAIDs (see the next two sections), it may
be a safer long-term choice for self-medication for some people. However,
because acetaminophen doesn’t block the inflammation that is a large part of
endometriosis, it may not be effective in the long run.
Aspirin
Aspirin is one of those modern medicines that was first discovered in nature
thousands of years ago. As early as 400 B.C., the Greek physician Hippocrates
prescribed tea made from the bark of the willow tree to relieve pain and fever.
In the 1800s, salicin was extracted in the laboratory from willow bark and the
spirea plant and transformed into the more active acetylsalicylic acid, known
today as aspirin. Aspirin is sold in tablets containing 325 mg or 500 mg.
Today aspirin remains one of the most commonly used pain relievers. Aspirin
inhibits prostaglandins, the chemicals responsible for uterine cramping. This
decreases pain, fever, and inflammation. (See the sidebar in this chapter,
“How do NSAIDs work” for more information.) Although aspirin is the grand-
daddy of all NSAIDs, it isn’t as effective as its newer relatives.
Newer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs work differently than other analgesics (see the sidebar, “How do
NSAIDs work?” in this chapter for more info), and because NSAIDs reduce
inflammation, they may be more effective in reducing pain than plain anal-
gesics. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, the chemicals responsible for uterine
cramping. The most common newer OTC NSAIDs include the following brand
and generic names:
247
Chapter 13: Managing the Chronic Physical Pain

 Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) sold OTC in doses up to 200 mg,
depending on the brand name (400, 600, and 800 mg are available by 
prescription)
 Naproxen (Naprosyn) 250 mg, 375 mg, 500 mg
 Naproxen Sodium (Aleve, Anaprox) 220 mg, 275 mg, 500 mg
NSAID daily doses shouldn’t exceed 2,400 mg unless you’re told to take more
by your doctor.
NSAIDs’ enzyme-inhibitor effect also increases your risk of bleeding and
stomach ulcers. If you want to take an OTC NSAID on a regular basis, discuss
it with your doctor first. Side effects of increased bleeding and stomach
ulcers can make NSAIDs dangerous if you have any of the following issues:
 Congestive heart failure
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
 Liver disease
 Renal (kidney) disease
 Stomach ulcers
NSAIDs have a large list of potential side effects besides the more serious
problems of bleeding and stomach ulcers. Allergic reactions are common. In
addition, you may experience any of the following:
 Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Drowsiness
 Fluid retention
 Headache
 Nausea
 Rash
 Vomiting
In addition, NSAIDs decrease blood flow to the kidneys and can raise blood
pressure in individuals with hypertension. NSAIDs can also interfere with the
metabolism of certain medications, such as lithium or methotrexate. Finally,
NSAIDs can increase symptoms in asthma sufferers.
248
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Choosing meds wisely
Start with your doctor when you need more information about OTC pain
relief medications. However, if you’re wandering around the 24-hour drug-
store at 4 a.m., calling the doctor may not be a good idea — not if you want
him to stay your doctor. If a pharmacist is on duty, she can help you out by
telling you which drug products have basically the same ingredients. You can
also keep the following in mind when you’re considering OTC drugs:
 Keep an eye out for the same ingredients. As you can see by reading
the previous section, some medications, such as brand-name Motrin and
generic ibuprofen, contain the same ingredients. This information is
important to know so you don’t overdose, thinking you’re taking two dif-
ferent drugs.
 Take single drugs rather than combination drugs. Taking single drugs,
such as plain aspirin, is better than taking combination drugs, like
Excedrin, which contains acetaminophen, aspirin, and a hefty dose of
caffeine. Combination drugs may give you ingredients you don’t need
and may increase the chance of drug interactions.
249
Chapter 13: Managing the Chronic Physical Pain
How do NSAIDs work?
NSAIDs work by blocking the production of
prostaglandins, the chemicals produced in the
uterus (as well as a number of other places) 
at the time of your period. They cause the
cramping that helps shed the uterine lining 
if you’re not pregnant, and can cause diarrhea,
fever, pain, and inflammation. Because
prostaglandins are responsible for uterine
cramping, medications that reduce their effects
can help block menstrual cramping.
Prostaglandins are produced within the body’s
cells by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX).
There are two COX enzymes, called, logically,
COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 enzymes support
platelets and protect your stomach lining; taking
aspirin or NSAIDs frequently decreases the pro-
tective effects of COX-1 and can cause bleed-
ing and ulcers in some people. Some NSAIDs
are more effective in blocking COX-1 than
others and vary in their tendency to cause
ulcers and promote bleeding.
Acetaminophen appears to block COX enzymes
only in the central nervous system. For this
reason, acetaminophen decreases pain and
fever but doesn’t decrease inflammation or
platelet function.
A promising new class of NSAIDs, COX-2
inhibitors, selectively block only the COX-2
enzymes. This approach initially looked good for
pain management because these drugs reduce
pain and inflammation while protecting the
stomach and platelets. A few years ago, how-
ever, COX-2 inhibitors reportedly appeared to
increase the risk of heart problems, and some
COX-2 inhibitors were taken off the market.
COX-2 inhibitors that are still available require a
doctor’s prescription.

 Ask your doctor for a prescription — and if he gives you one, have it
filled! Many times doctors hand out prescriptions at your appointment
and you never have them filled because you’ve seen the names of the
drugs on the pharmacy shelves. But doctors can prescribe drugs like
ibuprofen in higher dosages than you can buy them OTC. Although you
can certainly take four 200 mg pills rather than one 800 mg pill, why
would you want to? And it costs more to take several pills instead of one.
Trying Prescription Medications
OTC medications often aren’t enough to treat chronic pain. You may also
need to take prescription pain medication, at least at certain times of the
month. However, you may find that taking pain medication on a schedule is
more effective than waiting until the pain builds up.
This section looks at the different types of prescription medications that can
help you manage your pain. In this section, we cover prescriptions NSAIDs,
Ultram, opioids, antidepressants, and antiseizure drugs.
Taking prescription NSAIDs
Some prescription pain medications are the same medications you can buy
OTC but in higher dosages. One example of an NSAID available both OTC and
by prescription is ibuprofen, which comes in doses up to 200 milligrams 
OTC. You need a doctor’s prescription to buy ibuprofen in doses of 400 to 
800 milligrams.
Some common prescription NSAIDs (and their brand names) that require a
doctor’s prescription are
 Diclofenac (Cataflam, Voltaren)
 Etodolac (Lodine)
 Fenoprofen (Nalfon)
 Flurbiprofen (Ansaid)
 Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
 Indomethacin (Indocin)
 Ketoprofen (Orudis, Oruvail)
 Meclofenamate (Meclomen)
 Meloxicam (Mobic)
 Nabumetone (Relafen)
250
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Naproxen (Anaprox, Naprelan, Naprosyn)
 Oxaprozin (Daypro)
 Piroxicam (Feldene)
 Sulindac (Clinoril)
 Tolmetin (Tolectin)
COX-2 inhibitors are drugs that block certain prostaglandin-producing
enzymes. (See the sidebar “How do NSAIDS work?” for more info.) The only
COX-2 inhibitor still available by prescription is Celecoxib (Celebrex). In 2004,
the FDA removed other COX-2 inhibitors from the market because studies
showed an increased risk of heart disease in patients taking them.
Considering opioids
Opioids are a powerful prescription-only class of pain relievers related to the
granddaddy of all pain relievers, morphine. Also called narcotics, opioids
include the natural opium alkaloids, the semisynthetic opioids derived from
them, and the fully synthetic opioids. They all bind to opioid receptors found
principally in the brain and gastrointestinal tract.
The following includes some common prescription opioids, with their brand
name in parentheses:
 Codeine (Tylenol 3)
 Hydrocodone (Vicodin)
 Hydromorphine (Dilaudid)
 Meperidine (Demerol)
 Morphine
 Oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan)
Long-term use of these medications can lead to physical dependence and tol-
erance; you may need increasingly larger amounts to achieve the same effect.
Addiction to opioids can occur if the drugs are misused, taken in larger doses
or more often than prescribed, or mixed with other medications.
Table 13-1 lists drugs by classification and schedule, which is the way the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) defines the uses of certain drugs.
Schedule I drugs have high abuse potential, have no medical use, or haven’t
been proven to be safe, so we don’t list them. Because most opioids fall into
Schedules II to IV, we concentrate on them.

Some doctors are hesitant to prescribe opioids because of the risk of addic-
tion; other doctors are so negative about prescribing opioids that you may
leave their office in tears, feeling as if you’ve been treated like a drug addict
for even asking about them. (See the nearby sidebar, “Opioids can lead to
dependence and addiction” for more info.)
Finding a doctor who understands pain and is willing to treat it can be an
important part of your care. However, doctors who are willing to treat pain
are very different from doctors who indiscriminately overprescribe opioids.
How can you tell the difference? Your doctor is prescribing responsibly if he
 Asks about whether or not the drugs are helping, rather than just hand-
ing you another prescription
 Prescribes only a small amount of medication at a time rather than a
year’s supply
 Discusses alternative pain-relief methods to try along with the pills
252

medication with you

Trying Ultram
Tramadol (Ultram) is in a class by itself. Tramadol is an analgesic that has its
effects in the brain. Its mode of action resembles that of opioids, but
researchers believe that it has much less potential for abuse and addiction
than the opioids. It’s not derived from natural sources nor is it chemically
related to opioids. For these reasons, it hasn’t been classified as a controlled
substance. Ultram is effective in relieving moderate pain and causes less res-
piratory depression than opioids.
253
Chapter 13: Managing the Chronic Physical Pain
Opioids can lead to dependence and addiction
Anyone who takes opioids for any reason will
develop some degree of tolerance and depen-
dence over time. There’s a difference, however,
in tolerance, dependence, and addiction.
 Tolerance is the tendency of the body to
adapt to the effect of opioids; over time, the
body requires higher and higher doses to
produce the same effect.
 Dependence is the tendency of the body to
experience unpleasant side effects if a
person stops taking the drug abruptly.
 Addiction is a psychological dependence to
the side effects of opioids, such as eupho-
ria. The craving for the side effects leads to
taking medication when not medically nec-
essary. Addiction causes continued use
even when that use becomes self-destruc-
tive. Addiction is most common in people
who are taking medication purely for recre-
ational use; addiction is less common in
people using the drug for legitimate pur-
poses, such as pain management.

Even though Ultram isn’t classified as a controlled substance, as an atypical
opioid, it can produce many of the same euphoric effects and has a potential
for abuse and addiction.
Some of Ultram’s most common side effects are
 Agitation
 Blurred vision
 Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Dizziness
 Drowsiness
 Dry mouth
 Headache
 Mood changes
 Nervousness or anxiety
 Sweating
 Upset stomach
Like any medication, Ultram can also cause allergy symptoms and rare, but
serious, side effects. If you experience hives, swelling, fast heartbeat,
seizures, or hallucinations, you should, of course, notify your doctor immedi-
ately and go to the nearest emergency room.
Taking antidepressants
At first glance, you may think this section is in the wrong chapter. How can
taking prescription antidepressants help with pain? Actually, antidepressants
can help decrease chronic pain in several ways. The two most obvious ways
are
 Improved sleep so pain decreases
 Decreased depression, which is a common side effect of chronic pain
(Check out Chapter 15 for more information about depression and your
emotions.)
However, there’s much more to this story. Many studies have shown that
some classes of antidepressants have analgesic properties and have reduced
chronic pain in more than 50 percent of the people studied.
254
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Tricyclic antidepressants
The antidepressants that have been studied the most for pain relief are tri-
cyclic antidepressants. These antidepressants may work on pain by
 Blocking pain pathways
 Increasing endorphin release (Endorphins help regulate mood and 
block pain.)
Some of the most common tricyclic antidepressants (and their brand names)
are
 Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Amitril, Elevil, Endep)
 Desipramine (Norpramin)
 Doxipin hydrochloride (Sinequan)
 Imipramine hydrochloride (Janimine, Tofranil)
 Nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor)
Dosages for pain relief are often lower than dosages for treatment of depres-
sion. The drug may take several weeks to be effective, so don’t be ready to
give up if you don’t see any results within the first week or two.
Antidepressants do have side effects. Check out Chapter 15 for more 
information.
Other antidepressants
What about other antidepressants not in the tricyclic family? A number of
newer antidepressant drugs on the market fall into categories that are nearly
unpronounceable. Three new categories are
 Serotonin and Noradrenergic Reuptake Inhibitors (SNaRI), like venlafax-
ine and duloxetine
 Noradrenergic and Specific Serotoninergic Antidepressants (NaSSA), like
mirtazapine (Remeron)
 Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (NaRI), like reboxetine
SNaRI antidepressants are some of the most investigated of the new drugs
shown to be effective in the treatment of different kinds of pain, and appear
to have fewer side effects than TCAs. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine
(Effexor) have both been found to be effective in treating chronic pain.
Mirtazapine (Remeron) is an NaSSA that is more sedating than some of the
other antidepressants and may be helpful if you’re having trouble sleeping.
255
Chapter 13: Managing the Chronic Physical Pain

Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are useful for relieving neuro-
pathic pain. Citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxitene (Paxil), flu-
oxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) are all SSRIs. See Chapter 15 for more
on antidepressants and their effects.
Considering antiseizure medications
Some doctors prescribe antiseizure medications for neuropathic and chronic
pain, including pain associated with endometriosis. Two of these proven anti-
seizure medications are carbamazepine (Tegretol) and gabapentin (Neurontin).
The most common side effects to antiseizure medications are
 Dizziness
 Fatigue
 Headaches
 Sleeplessness
Creaming Away the Pain
You may think a painkiller in the form of a cream or patch may sound too
good to be true. However, pain medications, such as fentanyl, work quite
effectively as skin patches. Logically, other pain medications may eventually
work the same way.
Medications that are absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream avoid
the first pass effect; in other words, they don’t pass through the stomach and
liver. The most significant benefits to transdermal (through the skin) applica-
tions of medications are
 Fewer side effects, such as stomach upset
 Faster onset of pain relief than oral medication
 Possibly more of the drug reaching the pain site
 Possibly longer-lasting relief
A number of drugs are available either in cream form or in a patch; both
types are absorbed through the skin. Some examples are as follows:
256
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Over the counter
• Aspercreme: An aspirin cream.
• Ibugel: A gel that contains 5 percent ibuprofen and was as effective
as oral ibuprofen 400 mg in one study; approved for sale in Europe
but undergoing clinical trials in the United States.
• Menastil: A topical anesthetic sold in a lipstick-sized container.
The manufacturer claims Menastil is specifically effective against
menstrual cramps and the symptoms of endometriosis.
 Only by prescription
• Fentanyl: An opioid pain reliever that is available in transdermal
form and must be prescribed
• Lidocaine: A well-known anesthetic that is applied via a patch and
available by prescription
• Zonolon: A tricyclic antidepressant cream that contains doxipin
and is available by prescription
Is it worth giving topical medications a try before taking pills? It may be if you
have a sensitive stomach or have liver problems. However, remember that
these gels and creams do contain active medication; you can’t slather your-
self in them!
Exercising Away Your Pain
Exercise can really help decrease chronic pain; the key to beneficial exercise
is to start slow, do only what’s comfortable at first, increase gradually, and
most important of all, don’t give up too soon! Getting started on an exercise
program takes perseverance. The most important step you can take is the
first one: just get up and do it!
Gentle stretching exercises may be all you can manage at first, but as you
limber up, you may find a yoga or T’ai Chi class helpful in pushing you a bit
without injuring anything (check out Chapter 12 for more info).
Kegel exercises can also help with endometriosis pain by strengthening the
pelvic muscles and bladder. The best way to practice Kegels initially is to find
the pelvic muscles by trying to stop the flow of urine by squeezing the mus-
cles. After you’ve isolated the muscles, you can “Kegel” frequently during the
day. Kegels can help get your pelvic muscles back into shape after childbirth
as well!
257
Chapter 13: Managing the Chronic Physical Pain

Walking is one of the most beneficial exercises of all. It requires no equipment
other than a good pair of walking shoes. You can add hand weights as you
become more fit, and increase your speed and distance.
The best thing about exercise? It releases endorphins, chemicals that boost
your sense of well-being. (See Chapter 16 for more on exercise when you
have endometriosis.) Exercise may also reduce estrogen levels, and estrogen
promotes growth of endometrial implants.
Using Heat and Massage for Pain Relief
Sometimes simple methods work well for relieving pain. Heat can be a great
muscle relaxer. Sometimes just soaking in a warm tub or resting with a heat-
ing pad or hot water bottle can relieve pain. Some heating pads supply moist
heat, which can be even more effective than dry heat.
You can also make your own packs by warming slightly dampened towels in
the microwave. Remember that microwaves don’t apply heat evenly, and
make sure the towel doesn’t get too hot in one spot; you can end up with a
painful burn in addition to your other aches and pains. One advantage of
warm towels is that you can mold them to your aching areas, which is diffi-
cult to do with commercial heating pads.
You can also use massage therapy to decrease pain, relax muscles, and
relieve tension. Check out Chapter 12 for more on massage and other alterna-
tive treatments that can alleviate your pain.

All Things Teens: Diagnosing,
Treating, and Coping with
Endometriosis
In This Chapter
 Seeking a doctor’s advice early
 Recognizing the differences in teenage endometriosis
 Keeping up on treatment risks
 Opening the doors of communication
 Adjusting to the challenges of endometriosis
N
ot too many years ago, doctors thought teenagers couldn’t have
endometriosis, and many moms taught their daughters that pain,
cramps, and abnormal bleeding were just a normal part of becoming a
woman. Now that doctors have diagnosed endometriosis in girls as young as
11 years old, they’re more aware of endometriosis as a possible cause for a
teen’s painful periods.
In this chapter, we discuss how doctors can diagnose and treat endometrio-
sis in young patients, and how parents can keep communication open with
their teenage daughter (as well as with her doctor), can help teens feel well
enough to stay in school, and can preserve fertility in teens.
Making a Diagnosis in Teens 
(And Preteens)
The symptoms of endometriosis in teens (and even some preteens) are simi-
lar to those for women in their 20s or 30s, with the most common symptom
being painful periods, or dysmenorrhea. (Check out Chapter 2 for a complete
rundown of common symptoms.) The difference in teens, though, is that

many parents and doctors don’t consider endometriosis as a diagnosis for
the painful cramps that can keep a teen home from school or in bed a few
days each month.
Diagnosing endometriosis in teens starts with suspecting the disease and
actively looking for it. Doctors who look do find it. Statistics show that
 From 4 to 10 percent of teens with severe menstrual cramps will be
found to have endometriosis.
 Teens make up 5 to 6 percent of all endometriosis patients.
 More than 40 percent of women who have endometriosis say that their
symptoms started during their teen years.
Sadly, the average time between the start of endometriosis symptoms and
diagnosis is nearly ten years. But early treatment is likely to result in less
serious disease down the road and can help preserve normal reproductive
function.
The only way to truly diagnose endometriosis is surgery, but you may not
want to consider this route right off the bat. When doctors make a presumptive
diagnosis of endometriosis, they’re saying that all the symptoms fit and
endometriosis is likely the cause, but they haven’t proved 100 percent that
endometriosis is present.
This section focuses on you helping your teen by talking with her about
severe menstrual pain, helping her with the initial gynecological exam so her
doctor can make a presumptive diagnosis, and understanding what other
problems your teen’s doctor has to rule out before diagnosing endometriosis.
Letting teens know that severe 
menstrual pain isn’t normal
Many teens think that cramps and severe pain with their periods and in the
middle of their menstrual cycle is just a normal part of being a woman —
because their parents and friends told them. But believing this myth often leads
to a delayed diagnosis and treatment that can have long-lasting consequences.
Many teens (just like many adults!) play “Can you top this?” when discussing
medical issues. Unfortunately, if a teen’s friends exaggerate their painful pe-
riods to sound like ptomaine poisoning, she’s going to think painful periods
aren’t only normal but required.
Although some cramping is normal — up to 50 percent of teens experience
cramping during their periods — severe cramping and pain that interferes
with normal activities isn’t.
260
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Understanding why pain 
doesn’t recur every month
Endometriosis can be easy to dismiss as a possible diagnosis in a teen if she
doesn’t have painful periods every month. After all, if a teen has the disease,
why doesn’t it show up every month, rather than every other month, or for
two or three months in a row and then not for a few more months?
Many teens don’t have pain every month because they don’t ovulate regu-
larly. Especially in the first year or so of menstrual periods, an egg doesn’t
develop and estrogen doesn’t rise every month. And because estrogen feeds
the growing endometriosis, an anovulatory cycle (no egg) may escape severe
pelvic pain or cramps. This inconsistency can lead to a false sense that
endometriosis isn’t present when it may be.
Getting through the gyno exam
The first step to diagnosing endometriosis is a gynecologic exam (see Chapter 9
for more about GYN exams), but many teens have never had one — and
would rather not have one!
If grown women are often afraid of pelvic exams, imagine the fear that strikes
a teen or preteen who has to undergo such an ordeal! If you’re the parent of
the teen, you need to help your teen through this experience with a minimum
of trauma.
As with most frightening procedures, education is the best tool. Teens need
to know what to expect during a gynecologic exam. A doctor or nurse who
takes time to explain exactly what occurs and what it feels like is worth her
weight in gold. A doctor who takes her time and is extra gentle is also a
necessity!
Deep breathing techniques can help nervous teens get through the exam and
relax at the same time. Tense muscles make a thorough examination nearly
impossible. However, gynecologic examinations are possible without using a
speculum (an instrument used to hold the vagina open so the doctor can see
inside the vagina) or bimanual exam (using one hand in the vagina and the
other on the abdomen). A blindly-placed swab in the vagina (to check for
infection or abnormal cells) and an abdominal exam with ultrasound may 
suffice. A teen may tolerate a rectal exam better than a vaginal exam to deter-
mine pelvic abnormalities. All these methods are possible for examining a
young woman with fear of a full pelvic exam.
261
Chapter 14: All Things Teens: Diagnosing, Treating, and Coping with Endometriosis

Ruling out other problems
To make a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis, your teen’s doctor may
need to rule out other potential problems by looking for the following:
 Pelvic organ abnormalities: The most common symptom experienced
by teenagers with a uterine abnormality is severe menstrual cramps
caused by backward (retrograde) flow of menstrual blood through the
tubes. Early surgical correction of such an abnormality can avoid the
development of severe endometriosis is some patients. Pelvic ultra-
sound, performed through the vagina or abdominal wall, can verify that
the uterus and ovaries are normal. Unfortunately, unless an endometri-
oma is present in the ovary, ultrasound can’t “see” endometriosis.
 Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): Doctors must differentiate
between endometriosis and a sexually transmitted disease because the
diseases have some of the same symptoms but need very different treat-
ment. Unfortunately, the first diagnosis many doctors consider when
teens have severe pelvic pain is an STD rather than endometriosis.
Many doctors incorrectly assume that a teen with pelvic pain is having
sex. This assumption can be embarrassing for a teen who isn’t sexually
active and can lead to a lack of trust in a doctor who jumps to conclu-
sions. However, if a teen is sexually active, she needs to be honest; other-
wise, the doctor may overlook an important problem.
Doctors can diagnose STDs by taking a blood sample (for syphilis) or a
cervical swab (for chlamydia and gonorrhea). If a teen has been sexually
active, the speculum may be easier to insert into the vagina than with a
teen who isn’t sexually active. A Pap test is also necessary if a teen has
had intercourse because the test can detect changes in the cervix that
may lead to cervical cancer, which the doctor can then treat relatively
early and easily.
Having an STD doesn’t mean a teen can’t also have endometriosis, 
so she should follow up after STD treatment if symptoms haven’t 
disappeared!
 Sexual abuse: Healthcare providers have finally begun to realize that
sexual abuse can cause symptoms similar to endometriosis. During the
exam, the doctor can look for signs.
 Other organ system problems: Intestinal or urinary tract disease can
also mimic the symptoms of endometriosis and can be affected by the
menstrual cycle (see Chapter 2).
262
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Knowing the Risks When Choosing
Treatment for Teens
Treating teens with endometriosis may differ from treating adults in a
number of ways because a teen’s body hasn’t completely developed like an
adult’s. Teens have special issues, from fear of pelvic exams to preserving
their ability to have children. Teens and their parents need to carefully con-
sider the risks that accompany different medications as well as the risks of
surgery. This section looks at the important considerations and risks.
Being more conservative (or more 
aggressive?) when treating teens
Because teens generally aren’t planning to become pregnant for a few years,
their endometriosis requires treatment that won’t affect their chances of
pregnancy in the future.
Yet some doctors are hesitant to treat teens aggressively for fear of irrepara-
bly damaging growing reproductive systems. This fear, however, can lead to
undertreatment, which in turn doesn’t prevent the reproductive damage that
a more aggressive treatment may have prevented.
Make sure all parties — the doctor, the teenager, and the parents — stay
involved and aren’t afraid of frank discussions about treatment. (Check out
“Keeping Communication Open between Parent and Teen” later in this chap-
ter for more about the importance of communication.) Being too conserva-
tive or too aggressive in treatment can have long-term consequences.
Everyone involved needs the opportunity to talk through and understand all
the risks and benefits.
Realizing that teens may still be growing
You may wonder whether a teen’s physical immaturity affects the treatments
for endometriosis. In fact, many of the drug treatments for endometriosis can
damage growing bones. Because of this concern, doctors need to look at the
length of treatment, monitor closely for side effects, and provide add-back
therapy (check out Chapter 10 for more information on this treatment plan)
to offset negative effects.
263
Chapter 14: All Things Teens: Diagnosing, Treating, and Coping with Endometriosis

Examples of problematic teen treatments include estrogen and testosterone.
Estrogen can cause the fusion of the growth plate (preventing a child from
reaching her full height), and testosterone-like compounds can affect the gen-
ital system, hair and breast growth, and the voice. All hormonal medications
require cautious use.
Eying the medication risks
Medication choices for teens with endometriosis are somewhat more 
limited than they are for adults (check out Chapter 10, which discusses med-
ication treatments for endometriosis). Because many medications to treat
endometriosis can be harmful to a teen’s growth and development, selecting
the right medication for a teen (or preteen) is vital.
Treating teens with GnRH agonists
GnRH agonists, such as leuprolide acetate (Depot Lupron) or goserelin
acetate (Zoladex), work by shutting off hormones made by the ovaries that
lower estrogen levels. As a result, these drugs temporarily shut down the
menstrual cycle. Teens on GnRH agonists don’t usually have regular periods,
although they may have spotting at times.
The FDA has approved these drugs for use up to six months at a time. If used
for more than six months, studies have found they can cause permanent
changes in bone density. Although decreased bone density has no symptoms,
young women with low bone density are at increased risk of fracture related
to thin bones after menopause. For this reason, many doctors use add-back
therapy, which means that estrogen is prescribed along with the GnRH ago-
nists to protect against bone loss.
Putting teens on birth control pills
Hormonal treatments, such as birth control pills (BCPs), work well but may
give parents pause. A large number of BCPs are available today that have dif-
fering combinations of estrogen and progesterone — two female hormones.
(Some teens tolerate one combination better than another; some treatments
are helpful for teens with acne, and others may make acne worse.)
Often doctors direct a patient to take BCPs continuously, without a break in
the active pills for three months or more. This may allow for better suppres-
sion and periods only a few times a year.
Note: Some pills are packaged in this three-month format that may be toler-
ated by a teen, but patients may also use regular BCPs, skipping the sugar
pills (or inert pills) and taking only the active pills for three months straight.
With this treatment, monthly menstrual periods don’t occur. Although some
teens may find this change worrisome; others may find it freeing!
264
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

Taking BCPs, even for long periods of time, doesn’t make getting pregnant
more difficult in the future. Today’s pills are a much lower dose than those of
20 years ago, and normal periods usually resume within a month or two after
stopping the pill.
Using progestin-only pills
Another type of daily pill contains only synthetic progestin. Norethindrone
acetate (Aygestin) is one type of progestin-only medication. Patients that
can’t take hormone medication with synthetic estrogen may take this type of
medicine.
Progestin-only medications don’t supply estrogen. As a result, some, espe-
cially methoxyprogesterone acetate (Provera in its different forms), can
cause lower bone density, leading to a higher risk of osteoporosis (brittle
bones) if teens take them for a long time. The doctor may also prescribe
estrogen for patients with endometriosis who are on this medicine for more
than six months. Unfortunately, not all teens get pain relief from progestin-
only medications.
Injecting progestins
Another way of taking progestins is by injection. This method is a bit more
convenient because a patient has the injection only once every three months.
Depo-provera has been around for decades and can give good results. The
biggest problems with this treatment are possible irregular bleeding, the
absence of menstrual cycles, possible bone loss, and weight gain. Two other
possible drawbacks to injections are that:
 Some people, especially young people, are afraid of injections.
 After you inject the medication, you can’t remove it, so side effects can
persist for a while.
265
Chapter 14: All Things Teens: Diagnosing, Treating, and Coping with Endometriosis
Worrying about birth control pills and sex
Putting a teen on birth control pills (BCPs) can
be a guilt-producing experience for parents. On
one hand, it reduces your teen’s pain, which is
a big positive. On the other hand, you may worry
that you’re giving your teen carte blanche to
have sex.
Parents can’t help but worry about this conflict;
it’s what makes parents parents! But the fact is,
taking BCPs for endometriosis is different from
taking pills just so she won’t get pregnant. BCPs
are simply a medication for endometriosis. As a
parent, you shouldn’t feel guilty about putting
your child on them.
But this is an important time to have a dialogue
with your child. Honest discussion about the
reasons for using BCPs and the responsibility of
sexual relations is a must. In fact, the topic may
be a good lead into a frank, general talk about
sex or a reinforcement of past discussions.

Limiting NSAIDs
Though the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen
or acetaminophen, are safe, too much of any medication can be harmful.
These medications are available over the counter so your doctor may not
really know how much the patient has really taken. These medications do
have potentially severe side effects. Be sure that a healthcare provider is
monitoring your teen if she is taking more than a few pills a month.
Identifying surgical risks
As a teen or a parent of a teen with endometriosis, the thought of undergoing
surgery to treat endometriosis may be frightening. You may worry about
damage to reproductive organs, having a big scar, or something going wrong
during surgery.
Studies have shown that treating endometriosis surgically is better sooner
rather than later, especially if medical treatment isn’t working after six
months or so. The endometriosis lesions will cause less damage if a surgeon
removes them sooner and symptoms should diminish. You may be doing
your child a favor by deciding on surgery because it may prevent big prob-
lems or more extensive surgery in the future. As with all other treatments, a
discussion with the doctor about risks, benefits, and alternatives is essential.
The good news is that surgery has never been safer. A large incision isn’t usu-
ally necessary because most surgeries are by laparoscopy and require only a
few tiny incisions. (See Chapter 11 for more about surgery options.) Some of
your daughter’s friends may have had arthroscopic surgery for sports injuries,
so your child can feel better knowing her surgery may use a scope too.
Anesthesia today is also very safe because hospitals use less of it. Recovery
is short, only a few days, so your daughter can get back to school or other
activities quickly. (That can be good news or bad, depending on how she
looks at it!)
Keeping Communication Open 
between Parent and Teen
Being able to talk about endometriosis is important, but parents and teens
may both have trouble with this! Even in this tell-all era, many teens have
trouble talking to their parents about their periods, and many parents — who
didn’t discuss menstrual issues with their parents — have difficulty asking
their daughters about it. Although teens may discuss everything with their
friends (and, amazingly, tend to believe their friends’ advice as gospel truth),
they’re often reluctant to listen to you, the parent.
266
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

If you’re a parent, your part of keeping communication lines open is to
 Take complaints about cramps and pain seriously. Severe cramps and
pain aren’t part of normal menstruation, so follow up on them.
 Be nonjudgmental about your daughter’s complaints. Telling her that
she’s just being a baby or trying to get out of going to school isn’t going
to encourage her to tell you anything further.
 Ask open-ended questions about how she’s feeling. Don’t try to describe
what you think she should be feeling; ask her what she is feeling.
 Not be afraid to suggest a visit to the gynecologist. If your daughter has
endometriosis, the earlier treatment starts, the less harm will be done.
 Talk to your daughter’s school administrator if absences are a prob-
lem. You may need to explain that she has a chronic illness and will be
absent from time to time. You don’t need to go into great detail about
your daughter’s private health issues; a doctor’s note may be helpful
without being too descriptive.
If you’re a teen, you can help your parents by remembering these tips:
 Be honest about what you’re experiencing. Don’t minimize your symp-
toms, even if all your friends have assured you that they feel the exact
same way and it’s normal. Severe cramps and pain aren’t a normal part
of periods.
 Be willing to see a gynecologist. This isn’t high on the list of fun activi-
ties to do in your spare time, but an appointment with the GYN is the
only way to determine the cause of your symptoms.
 Trust your parents. They really only want to help, and watching you
suffer can make them crazy.
Helping Teens Live with Endometriosis
Teens can be notoriously bad about taking care of themselves when they
have a chronic illness. In fact, some studies show that teens with chronic ill-
nesses are more likely to take chances and live dangerously than the average
teen. The best way to help teens live with a chronic disease is to involve
them in their care.
Being a teen with a chronic disease and feeling like you have no control can
be bad enough. But living with a disease that involves reproductive organs is
even worse because you may be too embarrassed to talk about it to friends
and family (yes, even in this day and age!).
267
Chapter 14: All Things Teens: Diagnosing, Treating, and Coping with Endometriosis

Teens with endometriosis need to learn about it, and they need to learn how
to deal with it. As much as possible, these teens should also be in charge of
their own medication and treatment.
Chronic illness can affect teens emotionally in a number of ways. For exam-
ple, chronic illness can
 Interfere with their ability to be independent
 Disrupt relationships with peers
 Limit social activities
 Affect self-esteem
 Impose physical limitations
Needless to say, adolescence by itself brings problems to all of these areas;
adding a chronic illness to the mix can seriously stress both the teen and her
family. The following section provides some helpful tidbits to assist your teen
in living with endometriosis.
Handling school absence
More teens miss school for painful menstrual periods than for any other
reason, and teens with endometriosis are likely to miss more school days
than their friends. These absences can be a source of frustration for teens
and parents alike.
If you’re a teen with endometriosis and you miss school because of your
symptoms, you shouldn’t feel guilty. If you’re a parent of a teen with
endometriosis, don’t make your child feel guilty for missing school when 
her symptoms flare!
On the other hand, if you’re a parent, you may suspect that your teen is 
occasionally using endometriosis as an excuse to avoid gym class, or to 
skip school once in a while. How can you tell? Most teens in the throes of
endometriosis pain are obviously hurting, but the bottom line is, you need to
set some rules about missing school. For example, if your teen doesn’t go to
school, she can’t go out later when she miraculously recovers. And too many
absences may warrant a visit to the doctor to find out if the disease is wors-
ening or needs different treatment.
Keeping the lines of communication open with the school when absences are
unavoidable can help curb discipline problems in the future. Two suggestions
for dealing with the school are
268
Part III: Treating Endometriosis 

 Talking to the school administrator to let her know your daughter’s 
situation
 Asking your daughter’s doctor for a note that can excuse her from physi-
cal education when necessary
Watching for signs of depression
Having endometriosis can cause depression in teens, just like it can in adults.
Missing out on activities and suffering with pain each month can send teens
into an emotional tailspin. Depression is common among people with a
chronic illness such as endometriosis and can manifest itself both physically
and mentally.
Whether you’re a parent of a teen with endometriosis or are a teen with
endometriosis, you need to watch for these signs of possibly serious 
depression:
 You’re unable to sleep — or sleep too much
 Simple activities are exhausting
 Nothing seems like fun anymore
 Life doesn’t seem worth living
 Life seems unfair
 Being with other people is too much trouble
 Normal activities cause anxiety
 You have weight loss or gain
 You have physical symptoms, such as headaches, chest pain, diarrhea,
constipation, or stomachache
 You have guilty feelings
 You have recurring thoughts of suicide
If you notice these signs, keep a close eye on your teen. Although everyone is
entitled to a down day or two, depression that continues more than a few
days, that seems to be worsening, or that includes any hint of suicide or
wanting to harm herself warrants a visit to the doctor immediately. (Check
out Chapter 15 for more on coping with endometriosis.)

Chapter 14: All Things Teens: Diagnosing, Treating, and Coping with Endometriosis

Preserving fertility in teens 
with endometriosis
Although the last thing most teens want is to become pregnant, the day may
come when having a baby becomes a priority. For a teen with endometriosis,
a medical provider wants to do everything possible to make sure that preg-
nancy is possible in the future.
Your daughter’s doctor needs to be aggressive enough with treatments to pre-
vent long-term damage. Surgery, long-term medication, and other methods of
treatment are necessary and shouldn’t be delayed. Your daughter’s doctor can
help decide on the best way to preserve your teenage daughter’s fertility
while providing the best treatment options for her.
Finding a teen support network
Networking on the Internet is the one exercise most teens are good at. And
sources on endometriosis are available just for teens. The Endometriosis
Association (www.endometriosisassn.org) publishes a quarterly newslet-
ter just for teens and runs a correspondence network to connect teens that
have endometriosis. Teens can choose to e-mail, write, or call each other for
conversation and commiseration!
The Endometriosis Association also sponsors a mentor program for teens. 
A person with a few years of endo-experience under her belt answers ques-
tions, gives support, and generally provides a helping hand to teens recently
diagnosed with endometriosis.
Two other helpful sites include
 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG at www.
acog.org) has information on endometriosis.
 Another helpful Web site, sponsored by Children’s Hospital Boston, con-
tains articles for parents and teens alike. You can find this information at
www.youngwomenshealth.org.

D
oes anything make you feel more alone than a disease that others can’t
see? People with a chronic disease, such as endometriosis, deal with it
in different ways. Some never stop talking about the problems, and others
never talk about the disease at all. Neither extreme is good for your emo-
tional health.
Trying to find a happy medium is important for your own emotional and psy-
chological well-being. However, no matter how you cope, you may inevitably
be depressed or anxious at one time or another. Face it: Endometriosis is
very painful, and its symptoms are so overwhelming at times that even the
strongest people can experience depression and anxiety.
In this chapter, we help you to emotionally and psychologically handle the
frustration of endometriosis in a way that’s healthy for you — and the people
around you. We look at how endometriosis affects your mental well-being,
why women with endometriosis often battle depression and anxiety, how to
determine if you’re depressed or anxious, and how you can overcome the
funk with medications and support.

Understanding How Endometriosis 
Can Affect Your Mental Health
Initially you may be scratching your head and wondering how we can even
suggest that endometriosis may affect your emotional and psychological well
being. Endometriosis is a disease typically located in a woman’s reproductive
organs that causes physical pain, right? How can it affect your mental health?
In addition to causing severe physical pain (check out the symptoms of
endometriosis in Chapter 2), endometriosis can severely affect your mental
health. When you’re in pain, you may feel alone. As often as other people say,
“I know how you feel,” you can’t help but feel that they really don’t under-
stand at all. And verbalizing your pain over and over because other people
forget about it becomes frustrating. Yet you feel like a hypochondriac when
you have to keep turning down invitations and activities you may really want
to do. How do you keep the balance between feeling like a martyr when no
one understands and being this person whose every waking moment is con-
sumed with endometriosis? It’s not easy!
Unfortunately, endometriosis doesn’t go away just because you can’t see it or
decide not to think about it. At times you may feel great and barely give the
disease a second thought. Then another period starts, or you have mid-cycle
pain, and the problems all come rushing back into your life. (Read more
about physical pain relief in Chapter 13.)
Oftentimes people living with physical pain can develop emotional problems,
such as depression and anxiety (check out the next two sections). And these
emotional problems can even cause the physical pain and symptoms of
endometriosis to worsen. Sometimes, though, differentiating between chronic
pain and emotional pain isn’t easy because many of the symptoms of chronic
pain are also symptoms of depression.
When Depression Rears Its Ugly Head:
Feeling Down in the Dumps
Depression is common in the general population, never mind people with
chronic pain. In fact, depression may affect as many as 50 percent of all
chronic pain sufferers because depression can be a normal response to the
losses that come with chronic pain. When we also figure in the high percent-
age of women compared to men — up to three times as many — who suffer
from depression (at least in the years before menopause), the potential for a
woman with endometriosis to experience depression is very high.

Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

This section looks more closely at depression, identifies the signs of depres-
sion, and tells you when you may need to seek professional help.
What exactly is depression?
Depression — feeling sad, losing interest in daily activities, experiencing
changes in sleep patterns, and feeling like things will never be the same 
again — is a normal reaction to loss and drastic changes in life. However, if
depression continues for weeks after an event or occurs even without any
dramatic life events, you may be clinically depressed. Clinical depression is a
medical diagnosis indicating that medical intervention is needed. In other
words, you’re not likely to shake off clinical depression by giving yourself a
pep talk or by forcing yourself to get back to your regular routine. About 16
percent of people suffer from clinical depression at one time in their lives.
Clinical depression is more than just having a down day or two. Everyone has
bad days, and some people have personalities that tend to be more melan-
choly than others. Clinical depression is defined as sadness lasting more than
two weeks that has advanced to the point where it disrupts activities of daily
living or social functioning.
Depression can be very complex. Years ago, many people thought the cause
for depression was a personality weakness. And today some people believe
that depression is strictly a chemical disorder. However, neither explanation
is true. Depression is a multifactorial problem; chemical imbalances are cer-
tainly a part of depression, but other aspects contribute as well. Some of
these contributors are as follows:
 Alcohol and drug use: Daily use of marijuana has been associated with
a five-fold increase in depression, according to a study published in the
British Medical Journal in 2002.
 Family history: A 2004 statement from the National Institute of Mental
Health reports that major depression may be 40 to 70 percent heritable.
The statement also notes that development of depression hinges on the
interaction of several genes with environmental events.
 Life experiences: Past trauma, abuse, and life-affecting events can all
contribute to development of depression.
 Medical conditions: Certain illnesses, including heart disease and
hypothyroidism, may contribute to depression; certain prescription
medications, such as birth control pills, may also contribute to 
depression.
 Psychological factors: Low self-esteem and negative thinking can con-
tribute to depression.
275
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

What are the signs of depression?
Obviously, a disease with no clearly defined cause, pains that no one can see,
and treatments that seem to be of no help can all be upsetting. Some women
become withdrawn; others become angry. Some feel guilty over their inability
to fulfill responsibilities. Many women feel isolated and alone. You may even
begin to doubt your own symptoms, wondering whether this disease really is
all in your head.
Medical institutions love to put diseases under neat little codes so the insur-
ance company can pay for them. On paper, then, clinical depression has cer-
tain characteristics, and, according to insurance regulations, depressive
disorder has at least one of the following characteristics:
 Depressed mood
 Loss of interest or pleasure
In addition, you have to have four of the following symptoms to be diagnosed
with a depressive disorder:
 Feelings of overwhelming sadness or fear, or the seeming inability to feel
emotion
 A decrease in the amount of pleasure derived from what were previously
pleasurable activities
 Changing appetite and marked weight gain or loss
 Disturbed sleep patterns, such as insomnia, loss of REM sleep, or exces-
sive sleep
 Changes in activity levels, such as restlessness or a slowing of movement
 Fatigue — mental or physical
 Feelings of guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, anxiety, or fear
 Decrease in self-esteem
 Trouble concentrating or making decisions, or a generalized slowing of
thought processes
276
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 
The high numbers of depression
According to the World Health Organization,
clinical depression is currently the leading
cause of disability in the United States as 
well as other industrialized countries and is
expected to become the second leading cause
of disability worldwide (after heart disease) by
the year 2020. Most depression occurs between
the ages of 25 and 44, although it can strike at
any age. Most depressive episodes last six to
nine months.

 Self-harm or thinking about self-harm
 Preoccupation with death or suicide
 Reduced memory
If you feel some of these symptoms, you may be clinically depressed, and
should see your medical doctor to make sure there’s no physical cause first.
How do I know when I need help?
When you’re depressed, you may be the last person to recognize it. Often
friends or family may be the first to point out that you may be clinically
depressed. Although knowing that you’re depressed is the first step to get-
ting help, you may be too depressed to do something about it!
Don’t be offended if family members or close friends suggest you need help.
Although many people feel psychological help is a sign of weakness, actually
the opposite is true. Admitting that you’ve lost control of your life and need
help is much harder than just trying to slog through on your own. Fewer 
than half of all people with depression seek help, even though depression is
very treatable; more than 80 percent of people who seek treatment show
improvement.
Determining If Anxiety Is Your Problem
One trouble with chronic pain is that it never seems to end. If you have a
broken leg, at least you can look forward to the day your cast comes off and
you’re good as new. Chronic disease, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any-
thing to look forward to — except more pain. You may not be feeling depressed
about your condition, but you may have chronic anxiety. This section looks a
little closer at anxiety.
Defining anxiety
Anxiety is a state of apprehension and uneasiness where fear and worry affect
your moods and behavior. Anxiety is normal in new or stressful situations, but
anxiety can become chronic, leading to anxiety disorder. Anxiety can lead to
 Worrying that your condition will never improve. The one constant
you can count on in life is change. And you can hope your symptoms
will change for the better. New research is in progress, and new medica-
tions are available. Surgery is less invasive and more effective. Don’t
give up hoping that remedies will improve — chances are they will.
277
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

 Worrying that your condition will actually get worse. Over time, the
symptoms from endometriosis often improve — Stages III and IV of the
disease tend to burn out, so pain decreases (see Chapter 9 for more on
staging the disease). As a result, the odds are that your pain will dimin-
ish over time, not worsen. And few women have symptoms after
menopause. This fact may not be much of a consolation if you’re in your
20s, but if you’re in that age range, you’re bound to see many advances
in the treatment of your endometriosis.
Looking for possible signs
Anxiety disorder is a condition characterized by extreme, chronic anxiety
that disturbs mood, thought, behavior, and/or physiological activity. If you
have anxiety disorder, you’re anxious more often than not and find the anxi-
ety difficult to control. You may also
 Feel restless, keyed up, or on edge
 Be easily fatigued
 Have difficulty concentrating
 Be irritable
 Have muscle tension
 Suffer from sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or rest-
less unsatisfying sleep)
If you have three or more of the preceding symptoms, with symptoms occur-
ring more often than not over a six-month period, you may have an anxiety
disorder. See your medical doctor to make sure there’s no physical cause; he
can refer you to a mental health specialist if necessary.
Treating Emotional Problems 
with Medication
Experts differ on treatment for depression and anxiety. Although some doc-
tors feel a combination of therapy and medication is most helpful, others
believe a trial of antidepressant medication may be adequate.
If you want to try medication without counseling first, your doctor may sug-
gest one of the many antidepressants available. Most of these medications
change the balance of the nerve chemicals in your brain. These chemical
messengers, called neurotransmitters, are released by nerves and then taken
up again by the nerves for reuse.
278
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

If you find medication alone isn’t enough, many therapists, psychologists,
and psychiatrists specialize in women’s issues. But, if you want a more casual
setting, support groups and online bulletin boards and chat rooms may be for
you. (Check out “Expressing Your Frustration without Alienating Everyone
You Know” later in this chapter.)
If you and your doctor agree that medication is the avenue for you to pursue,
this section can help. It looks more closely at the different types of antide-
pressant medication available that can help you cope with depression and
anxiety. (See Chapter 13 for medications that relieve the physical pain of
endometriosis.)
Trying tricyclics
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been around a long time. They
increase the brain’s supply of two neurotransmitters, serotonin and norepi-
nephrine, which are abnormally low in people with depression. The following
list contains some common TCAs (brand names are in parentheses):
 Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil, Emitrip, Endep, Enovil)
 Amoxapine (Asendin)
 Clomipramine hydrochloride (Anafranil)
 Desipramine hydrochloride (Norpramine, Pertofrane)
 Doxepin hydrochloride (Adapin, Sinequan)
 Imipramine hydrochloride (Janimine, Tipramine, Tofranil)
 Pamelor (Nortiptyline)
 Protriptyline hydrochloride (Triptil, Vivactil)
Doctors usually prescribe TCAs at a low dose initially and slowly increase the
dosage until you start to see results. Don’t expect overnight results; the dif-
ference may not be noticeable for a few weeks.
One problem with TCAs is their effect on other neurotransmitters and brain
cell transmitters, which can lead to unpleasant side effects. Some common
side effects and the reasons they occur are
 Blurred vision, constipation, dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, and diffi-
culty emptying the bladder. Amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin,
imipramine, and protriptyline are likely to cause these side effects.
 Dizziness and decreased blood pressure when you’re standing. This
side effect is most common if you’re taking amitriptyline and is least
likely to occur if you’re taking amoxapine or nortriptyline.
279
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

 Drowsiness. Doxepin, amitriptyline, and imipramine are three TCAs that
often cause drowsiness.
 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some patients taking clomipramine
for long periods of time have a small risk of developing this syndrome,
which can cause fever, fast or irregular heartbeat, sweating, loss of blad-
der control, and even seizures.
 Sexual difficulties. Many antidepressants cause loss of sexual desire. If
this problem is significant for you, bupropion (Wellbutrin) may be an
option for you. (See more on Wellbutrin in the section “Looking at the
latest antidepressants” later in this chapter.)
 Sun sensitivity. TCAs can increase your sun sensitivity. Be sure to use a
good sunblock and avoid tanning salons and sunlamps.
 Weight gain. Many TCAs cause weight gain. If this is a concern of yours,
ask your doctor about switching to one of the newer antidepressants,
such as Wellbutrin, Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft, Desyrel, or Effexor, which are
less likely to cause weight gain.
If you have any of the following issues, make sure your doctor knows about
them before you take TCAs because the drugs may cause complications or
interactions in these cases:
 Alcohol abuse (TCAs may increase depressant effects of alcohol)
 Allergies (to TCAs, foods, preservatives, dyes)
 Asthma
 Blood disorders
 Contact lenses (drugs may cause dry eyes)
 Convulsions or seizures
 Glaucoma or increased eye pressure
 Heart disease
 High blood pressure
 Hyperthyroid
 Intestinal problems (TCAs may cause increased risk of serious side
effects)
 Kidney disease
 Liver disease (may raise blood levels of TCAs, causing more side 
effects)
 Manic depression
 Schizophrenia (TCAs may worsen schizophrenia)
280
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

 Stomach problems (TCAs may cause increased risk of serious side
effects)
 Urinary problems
If you have a history of heart problems, avoid taking TCAs.
Switching to SSRIs and other 
new antidepressants
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a newer class of antide-
pressants. They’re effective in approximately the same number of people
who find relief from TCAs, but, because they react only with one neurotrans-
mitter (serotonin), they have fewer side effects.
Well-known SSRIs that doctors frequently prescribe are escitalopram
(Lexapro), citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and
sertraline (Zoloft).
Despite their popularity and fewer side effects, these antidepressants still
have some side effects. Some of the more common effects include
 Diarrhea (especially with Zoloft)
 Dry mouth
 Headache
 Insomnia
 Nausea
 Nervousness (especially if you’re taking Prozac; you also may not be
able to sit still)
 Sexual problems
 Tiredness (especially if you’re taking Paxil)
Looking at the latest antidepressants
The new antidepressants sound like alphabet soup, with names like SNRI
(serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) and NRI (selective norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors). Most of these drugs differ from TCAs and
SSRIs in side effects rather than in effectiveness.
 Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is chemically unrelated to TCAs or SSRIs.
Bupropion’s main side effects are agitation, constipation, dry mouth,
headache, insomnia, nausea, and tremors.
281
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

 Duloxetine hydrochloride (Cymbalta) is an SNRI. Nausea, dry mouth,
constipation, loss of appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, increased
sweating, blurred vision, rash, and itching are common side effects.
 Nefazodone (Serzone) is chemically unrelated to TCAs or SSRIs.
Nefazodone is chemically similar to trazodone (Desyrel), another antide-
pressant. The most common side effects are agitation, blurred vision,
confusion, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, and tiredness.
 Venlafaxine (Effexor) is a potent SNRI and a weak inhibitor of dopamine
reuptake. Venlafaxine can cause similar side effects to other antidepres-
sants. Like most antidepressants, it can cause nausea, headaches, anxiety,
insomnia, drowsiness, and loss of appetite. Increased blood pressure can
occur, so blood pressure should be monitored. Seizures have occurred.
Avoiding serotonin syndrome
Whenever you switch from one antidepressant to another, you need to allow
a washout period so the drugs don’t overlap in your system. Failure to do so
can cause serotonin syndrome, a condition that results from overstimulation
of serotonin receptors. Taking antidepressants with certain prescribed med-
ications, over-the-counter herbal meds, and some recreational drugs can also
cause this syndrome (check with your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these
possible drugs).
Stopping antidepressants
If you’ve been on antidepressants for some time and you plan to stop taking
them, you first need to consult with your doctor. Weaning down your dose
gradually is better than going cold turkey. Stopping antidepressants abruptly
can cause symptoms such as
 Agitation
 Anxiety
 Blurred vision
 Dizziness
 Electric shock sensations
 Fatigue
 Hallucinations
 Insomnia
 Irritability
 Myalgia (generalized muscle pain)
282
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

 Nausea
 Sweating
 Tingling sensations
 Vivid dreams
Your doctor can slowly decrease your dose while watching for signs that
depression is coming back. Your family or friends may notice a change for the
worse before you do, so be sure to listen if they voice concerns that you’re
becoming depressed again, and follow up with your doctor immediately.
Expressing Your Frustration without
Alienating Everyone You Know
You probably know when your audience isn’t paying attention. They start to
twitch, look away, shift from foot to foot, and demonstrate a host of other
verbal and physical clues that say, “I’m tired of hearing about this.” Of
course, their actions may just make you want to shout back, “I’m tired of
living this too! Listen to me!” But that approach isn’t likely to get you any-
where. Sometimes you need to look elsewhere to express how you feel, espe-
cially if the people close to you just can’t hear you.
This section looks at who you can turn to for help, including friends and
family, support groups, and even a professional therapist.
Finding friends who understand
When all is said and done, the people you want to be around you are your
family and friends. They really do want to help, but sometimes they don’t
know how to go about it. How can you help them help you? Here are some
suggestions:
 Have them read Chapter 17, which is for family and friends. In fact,
you may want to read it too!
 Don’t expect Mr. Macho Man to turn into Mr. Sensitivity overnight.
Your partner cares deeply, but guys generally aren’t as good as women
at giving sympathy. Or he may show sensitivity once or twice and feel
like that’s enough. Guys can be educated, but it takes time.
 Try not to make endometriosis the topic of every conversation. Ask
how other people are feeling sometimes. In fact, don’t let endometriosis
become the center of your world. Life is short — don’t waste it.
283
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

 Don’t let your feelings get hurt too easily. Accept that friends have
other thoughts on their minds, so they may forget to ask about your
most recent surgery, or they may forget that you don’t feel like going out
right now. The oversights don’t mean these folks don’t care — they just
forget at times.
 Thank your friends and family for what they do for you. Everyone
likes to be appreciated!
However, sometimes your friends and family can’t be your support system.
Because endometriosis is invisible, some people may have an “out of sight,
out of mind” mentality, no matter how hard you try to convey what you’re
feeling. Sometimes people get tired of hearing about the problem, especially
when they can’t fix it.
Even if they’re your nearest and dearest family and friends, your situation
doesn’t affect them in the same way it affects you. Yes, they’re upset for you.
Yes, they feel bad, and they do care what you’re feeling. But sometimes they
have problems they want to talk about too. Remember, they also have stories
to tell. And sometimes you need to listen to them and give them your shoul-
der to cry on.
Eventually, however, you may have to turn elsewhere — such as to support
groups or to a professional therapist — for support (check out the next two
sections).
Looking for support from groups
So where do you go when you know your family and friends don’t want to
hear the word endometriosis one more time? You go to people who not only
know about endometriosis but also want to talk about it as much as you do!
Two of the most common types of support groups are traditional support
groups that usually meet in your local hospital and online support networks,
where you can find helpful people wanting to chat at almost all hours of the
day and night.
Traditional support groups
Nearly every large city has support groups for women with endometriosis;
your weekend paper often lists the meeting times and locations. Or you can
call your local hospitals to find out if they sponsor support groups. The draw-
back to support groups is their limited meeting schedule (usually only once a
month), but you can make friends there that you can talk with more fre-
quently. If you’re not comfortable talking about your disease face to face in a
social setting, check out the next section, which may be just what you’re
looking for.
284
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

Online support networks
Have you ever wondered how on earth people can spend hours with a bunch
of strangers in a chat room? Just like people come in all shapes and sizes, so
do their reasons for talking online with other women they’ll probably never
meet. When the common enemy is endometriosis, two important reasons to
talk online are
 Anonymity: Online bulletin boards and chat rooms are anonymous. You
can talk about your symptoms, feelings, treatments, relationships, suc-
cesses, and failures without fear of being recognized, patronized, or
ostracized.
 Empathy: The people who frequent the boards are, for the most part,
women dealing with the same problems and frustrations of endometrio-
sis that you are. You can pour your heart out and someone is sure to
understand.
Need some encouragement to jump in? You can find bulletin boards and chat
rooms at www.google.com or any search engine. When you type endometrio-
sis bulletin board or endometriosis chat room on the search line, you get more
than 100,000 hits! (See Appendix B for a list of some good Web sites that have
informative forums.)
Whichever board you finally settle on, here are a few common-sense 
guidelines:
 Maintain some anonymity. Use made-up names when you chat, includ-
ing your significant other’s name your kids’ names. You don’t know
who’s reading, and you want to be able to say your peace without your
next-door neighbor reading it — and knowing who you are!
 Start slow. Take time to get the feel of a bulletin board group; by listen-
ing to the give and take on a board, you can decide if you really want to
bare all there.
 Never meet a bulletin board friend for the first time at your home.
Some people seem saner online than in person, and you may regret the
day you told someone where you lived! Meet in a public place.
 Balance questions with support. Every bulletin board has people who
continually ask for advice and support but never share their own
wisdom or show their concern for other members.
 Remember — Meaning is often lost online. In conversation, you can
hear inflections and see facial expressions that help communicate a
speaker’s meaning. But these advantages are lost online, so readers
need to give writers the benefit of the doubt. If a remark sounds out of
place, maybe it was intended as humor, or maybe it was a typo!
When you’re the writer, use the common abbreviations (for example,
LOL for laughing out loud) to make your meaning clearer.
285
Chapter 15: Coping with Endometriosis and Your Emotions

 Remember — You have a life! Bulletin boards and chat rooms are
addictive. Ask any teenager! But anyone, adults included, can get
hooked and spend hours online. Limit your time, or you may end up
needing a support group for Internet addictions!
Turning to a therapist
Finding a therapist isn’t easy. Therapists can be medical doctors (psychia-
trists), psychologists, social workers, or certified counselors. Therapists
have different philosophies and methods; a therapy technique that works
well for your friend may be a total bust for you.
Your doctor may suggest a certain therapist, and that’s a good place to start.
But don’t feel that you have to stay with someone whose approach isn’t help-
ing you. Feel free to try someone else if you don’t feel your therapist is right
for you. Make sure that you give it a few months first, though; therapy doesn’t
work immediately. Follow our guidelines in Chapter 8 to find a therapist that
you not only can trust, but one that will help you get back to normal.
286
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 
Each online bulletin board is a bit different
As you search through the bulletin board results
from your search engine, you notice that each
bulletin board is a little different. Keep the fol-
lowing in mind when selecting an online support
group. Some basic formats are
 Very tight: Moderators keep a close watch,
deleting problematic postings and banning
posters who get out of line with personal
remarks.
 Very loose: Just like the Wild West, any-
thing goes, and it’s every woman for herself!
 Very sponsored: Drug companies and 
doctors who specialize in infertility or other
endometriosis-related issues frequently
maintain their own boards.

n a perfect world, you wouldn’t have the inconvenience of endometriosis —
but in the real world, you do. However, having endometriosis doesn’t have
to mean the end of life for you. For the most part, you don’t really want to
change your life completely. Maybe you’re fairly happy with it the way it is.
And if you aren’t completely happy with your life, you may feel too over-
whelmed to make any significant changes.
However, change can be good, even if you’re happy with your life the way it
is. And if you’re too busy or don’t know where to start making some lifestyle
changes, don’t worry. This chapter can help you analyze your lifestyle a bit
more closely.
Finding the right job, decreasing your stress, and improving your sex life may
not make you forget your endometriosis, but they can add to your life in a
way you didn’t think was possible. Even little choices like eating right and
exercising regularly can change your outlook on life (and even help reduce
the pain). In this chapter, we’re your cheerleaders, encouraging you to make
some positive changes that can help decrease the hold endometriosis has on
your life.

Focusing on Life beyond Endometriosis
What’s the first step to improving your life when you have a chronic disease?
Change your focus. Stop putting endometriosis in the center stage of your
life. Everything doesn’t have to be about endometriosis, even if you’re in
pain, even if you never know how you’re going to feel from day to day.
Just by changing your perspective on life, you can make significant changes
(and maybe start to feel a bit better). This section shows you how staying
positive and adjusting your schedule to allow for good and bad days is a
good start.
Keeping a positive attitude
As with any chronic disease process, a positive attitude can’t cure endometrio-
sis, but it can make the disease much more tolerable for you and your family
and friends. Staying positive may be an easy concept, but when you have to
walk the walk (not just talk the talk), the concept isn’t that easy. However, you
can express a positive attitude simply through an optimistic rather than pes-
simistic attitude toward life.
We’re not the only people in the world to say that a positive attitude can
overcome a lot of ills. Consider these studies and their conclusions:
 A Dutch study of more than 900 people found that people who described
themselves as being highly optimistic had a 23 percent lower risk of car-
diovascular death and had a 55 percent lower risk of all causes of death
than people who said they were highly pessimistic.
 A study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
links negative brain activity with a weakened immune system — and
we’re discovering that endometriosis may be linked with immune issues.
 A study summarizing more than 30 years of data by the Mayo Clinic
reports that people who expect misfortune and who only see the darker
side of life don’t live as long as people with a more optimistic view.
Dozens of studies similar to these all seem to agree: Optimistic, positive
people live longer than negative, pessimistic people.
This news is great if you’re already a positive person. But what if you’re not?
With some work, you can improve your outlook. For example, you can:
 Quiet your inner critic, the little voice that whispers “You can’t do it”
or “You’ll never get all this done.” Teach yourself instead to concen-
trate on the “I can” messages. You can’t do it overnight; it takes time to
change your mindset, but you can do it.
288
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

 Put everything in perspective. Ask yourself, “Will this matter in 20
years? Will it even matter next week?” You can easily get discouraged by
little events that have no consequence in your overall life, like being cut
off by another driver. Put everything in the big picture, and you’ll see
how unimportant life’s little annoyances really are.
 So what about the big stuff? Everyone has painful traumas in life. Even
in the worst of situations, you can make choices. Focus on what you can
do in difficult situations, not on what you can’t change.
 Make positive changes in your life. Having goals and meeting them give
you a sense of control in your life, and when you have a chronic illness
like endometriosis, you need to know your life is ultimately still in your
own hands. You may always have pain, but you can do things to decrease
the pain. You may miss some time at work — but you may miss less this
year than last. You may not be able to work at your dream job — but you
can work at something you like almost as much. You always have room
for improvement, if you’re willing to take steps toward it.
This chapter can change your life if you put the principles into practice —
just reading them isn’t enough! And yes, we know it’s not easy. But the
results, we promise, are worth the effort.
Scheduling around good and bad days
Keeping a positive outlook isn’t always easy because some days with
endometriosis are hellish. But some days are also better than others. When
you have endometriosis, do some preplanning so endometriosis doesn’t ruin
every single day.
The good news is that, with endometriosis, you can sometimes project which
days are problem days. For example, if you’re planning a once-in-a-lifetime
visit to Hawaii, don’t plan it when you expect your period. Or plan ahead and
take medication (birth control pills or progestins) to control your symptoms
or hold off your period during your trip. The result? No period cramps and
pain and no mess from period bleeding. Two bonuses in one!
Women have scheduled their periods for years for major occasions like wed-
dings, but many women need to think of scheduling their real lives in the
same way. Most people have some control over vacation schedules and even
the date to have the whole family over to dinner.
Naturally, we don’t have this kind of control over attending someone else’s
wedding or going to school. Birth control pills or progestins (even as long-
term injections) can be your best friend in these situations. You can take
birth control pills for longer periods of time if you need to get through a spe-
cial occasion without pain and bleeding. And, of course, birth control pills
can help reduce pain and bleeding even when they do occur. (See Chapter 10
for more on how taking birth control pills can benefit endometriosis.)
289
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

Coping with Work When 
You Don’t Feel Good
Like it or not, work is a big part of your life (unless you won the lottery and are
sitting around eating bonbons all day, which is another issue all in itself). But
work brings certain expectations. Bosses expect you to be at work when they
want you there, and even the most sympathetic bosses need to limit call ins
and sick time. Besides, you can’t use sick days for predictable monthly aches
and pains when you may need those days for another illness or even surgery.
This section helps you analyze what type of job is appropriate for you, dis-
cusses whether you need to share your medical history with your prospec-
tive boss, and helps you better manage your sick time.
Finding the right job for you
Find a job that has a flexible schedule. However, landing a flexible job is
easier said than done. And how many jobs are really flexible? Even tradition-
ally flexible jobs, such as per diem nursing or substitute teaching, aren’t
totally flexible because you work when they need you, not when you want to.
Considering different options
A job where you can work when you’re well and stay home when you’re not is
difficult to find. But some jobs may work better for you than others. Obviously,
the more flexible a job, the better it is for you. When looking for a job, consider
these questions:
 Can you switch days with other employees? Having a co-worker who’s
willing to trade days can be a big bonus.
 Can you work from home? With computer access, many jobs allow
work from home a few days a month. Can you work at home while lying
on the couch with a heating pad on days when you’re not feeling well?
 Can you work per diem, coming in only on days when you feel well?
For example, many hospitals have per diem positions for nurses.
Many jobs come with stress levels through the roof. In fact, some professions
promote their long hours and high stress levels as a badge of honor! Women
seeking these high-powered careers often work long, hard hours and put off
having children, perpetuating the myth that career women are the only ones
with endometriosis. Although the myth is hot air (see Chapter 18 for more
discussion on this stereotype), stress may be related to endometriosis, and
290
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

these types of careers can pile it on. (Check out “De-stressing Your Life: 
More Than Just Breathing in Slowly” later in this chapter for more info.)
Making career sacrifices or not?
If your endometriosis is killing you, your job may be part of the problem.
What good is a great career if your life is in shambles? You don’t have to give
up your stressful job, but you may need to make some concessions.
Look for a way to stay in your chosen field but decrease the stress. This
change may mean that you don’t make partner or that you don’t make the
salary you want, so the 80-hour week can be tough to leave (especially if
you’re a driven person). But your health may depend on it.
Being honest with your potential boss?
Is it better to tell a potential boss that you have a chronic disease, or is it
wiser to keep quiet? Several schools of thought exist about disclosing an
invisible illness when you’re applying for a new job. You certainly won’t be
the only one having this inner debate; as many as 40 percent of American
workers have a chronic illness, and employees justifiably worry about
increased health costs and decreased productivity for this 40 percent.
If endometriosis is just an inconvenience in your life (accounting for no more
than a few days a year of down time), you probably see no reason to discuss
it with a future employer. However, if endometriosis is a major pain for a
major part of your life, you may consider bringing it up. You should base part
of your decision on how much endometriosis incapacitates you. For example:
 Do you curl up in a ball on the bed for two or three days every month?
 Can you keep symptoms under control enough to go to work?
 Is surgery in your future?
 Are you thinking of starting a family and do you suspect that you’ll need
time-consuming, high-tech treatments, such as in vitro fertilization?
Advantages of telling your future boss
The pros for disclosure to your future boss are as follows:
 Your boss will know why you’re out instead of having to guess what your
excuses mean.
 You can tell the truth about your absences.
 Disclosing a disability or illness to an employer from the beginning may
protect your employment under equality legislation.
291
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

Disadvantages of telling your future boss
The cons for discussing a chronic disease before you’re hired are
 The employer may not hire you if she suspects you’ll miss a lot of work.
Although the Equal Opportunity laws say employers can’t discriminate
because of a disability, the laws don’t say you have to be hired. Someone
else may get the job just because she seems like a better fit — and that
can mean anything the employer wants it to!
 If your superiors think your health may compromise a job, you may face
a subtle bias when promotions and assignments come around.
Being aware of your sick time
When you have endometriosis, you may want to call in sick during your down
days, right when your period is in full throttle. However, most businesses
292
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 
Knowing your rights under the Employment
Equality Act
The Employment Equality Act of 1998, Section 2,
outlaws discrimination by employers and
employment agencies based on several cate-
gories, including chronic illness such as
endometriosis. So if you have endometriosis
and think that your employer may have fired you
because of your disease, you may need to pull
rank by quoting the Employment Equality Act of
1998, Section 2. We hope you never need to, but
it’s nice to know your rights. This act defines
disability as:
 The total or partial absence of a person’s
bodily functions, including the absence of a
part of a person’s body
 The presence in the body of organisms
causing, or likely to cause, chronic illness
or illness
 The malfunction, malformation, or disfig-
urement of a part of a person’s body
 A condition or malfunction that results in a
person learning differently from persons
without the condition or malfunction
 A condition, illness, or disease that results
in a disturbance in a person’s thought
processes, perception of reality, emotions,
or judgment
 A condition that exists at present, or which
previously existed but no longer exists, or
which may exist in the future, or which is
imputed to a person
Does endometriosis fit these criteria? Yes,
under several categories. Is there a catch? Of
course. You can be fired for other reasons — a
chronic illness doesn’t guarantee you a job.
However, your place of employment must make
an effort to accommodate your disabilities
within reason, and, if possible, retrain you if you
can’t do your current job. Obviously, a mom and
pop operation can’t provide retraining if it only
offers one type of job.

only allot you X number of sick days a year. How can you manage those eight
to ten days so that you don’t end up using them all before March?
Although “How much sick time do I get?” can’t be the first question out of
your mouth during a job interview, you do need to know not only how much
time you get, but also how you can use it. For example:
 Can you take half a day at a time?
 Do you have a waiting period before you can start using sick time?
 What happens when you run out of sick time?
 Does your time off come out of your vacation time or can you take a day
off without pay?
 If you’re on salary, what is a normal number of sick days and what does
the employer consider excessive?
Obviously, the more flexible your sick time, the better off you are. Some work-
places dock vacation time if you take off sick right before or after vacation,
even though you’re legitimately ill. Find out what the procedure is for sick
time. Do you have to call in by a certain time or bring in a doctor’s note if
you’re out more than a day or two? Knowing the rules in advance can help
you maximize your sick time.
De-stressing Your Life: More Than 
Just Breathing in Slowly
If you have a chronic disease, such as endometriosis, de-stressing your life
can make a significant difference. Stress can weaken your immune system,
and worsen symptoms of endometriosis.
You can rely on yourself to de-stress, or you can seek outside help to avoid
internalizing your stress. Studies have shown that people who keep stress
inside have more physical and emotional problems than people who vent.
This externalization can improve your immune system function and help you
psychologically.
Consider the following people when you need to de-stress your life:
 Yourself: Yes, you can de-stress your life, but you need to teach yourself
not to sweat the small stuff (and even some of the big stuff).
293
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

Try the following tips to de-stress your life:
• Keep a diary. (See Chapter 2 for more info.)
• Take a long walk while listening to a relaxing CD on headphones.
• Get a massage. (See Chapter 12 for additional treatment options.)
 Friends and family: You can ask your closest loved ones to help you get
through the tough times. Be honest with them about your problem and
how you feel at those times. These people can then try to help de-stress
your life. If they know when the bad times are and what you go though,
they can support you and not add to your stress level. (For more sugges-
tions, see Chapter 17, which is directed to these important folks.)
The same advice is good for your friends and extended family. Again, be
upfront with them. You have nothing to hide, you didn’t want to have
endometriosis, and they can help you avoid stress in you everyday life.
 Co-workers or your boss: The workplace is another area where you can
reduce stress. Don’t hide you problem. Let your boss and co-workers
know about your bad days — maybe they can help you cope with the
stress of work so you don’t have to take a day off. (Check out “Coping
with Work When You Don’t Feel Good” earlier in this chapter for more
work-related info.)
 Professional therapist: If you feel you can’t de-stress on your own, pro-
fessional help is available. Psychologists are trained to help you deal
with the stress of endometriosis and make your life more comfortable.
Working with a therapist doesn’t mean you’re crazy, and she can help
you avoid driving other people crazy when you’re going through a bad
time with your disease.
 Spiritual support: If you have a priest, rabbi, or other spiritual support,
seek guidance. He or she may be able to help you deal with the stress of
everyday life, marriage, kids, and work, and may help you soothe your
stress spiritually.
Changing Your Bad Habits
Everyone has a bad habit or two — behaviors you probably know aren’t good
for you, like eating the wrong foods, smoking, or overindulging in alcohol.
Although the occasional indulgence probably won’t hurt you, regular doses
of things that aren’t good for you can harm your health. When you have a
chronic disease like endometriosis, anything that harms your health can
worsen your symptoms.
No matter what your bad habit is, this section can help. We provide plenty of
information to help you change your eating habits. We also look at your
drinking and smoking habits and explain how cutting back can make a differ-
ence even if you can’t completely stop.
294
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

Eating well really can change your life
Everyone has to eat, but, unfortunately, most people don’t eat very well.
Many people just don’t eat the food they should, even though they want to
and even try to. And when you have endometriosis, eating well is extra
important.
Eating well really does make a difference in how you feel. It can help keep
your weight normal, keep your energy levels high, and prevent heart disease
and other long-term illness. Many theories on how to eat when you have
endometriosis are out there too. Some plans probably work better for some
people than others. In general, eating more fresh food rather than processed,
and keeping your saturated fats low and your veggie and fruit intake high
works for just about everybody.
So are you ready to start eating better (and feeling better)? This section looks
more closely at different steps you can take to improve your diet and break
the bad habits of eating unhealthy food.
Do certain foods worsen endometriosis?
Many nutritionists and holistic medical practitioners claim to know what
foods are best if you have endometriosis, and most of their recommendations
are similar. Almost all of these diets stress the following:
 Eat less dairy. Dairy products contain saturated fat, which increases the
circulation of estrogen and produces prostaglandin F2-alpha, a fatty acid
that can increase the inflammation and cramping from endometriosis.
 Eat less meat. When you do eat meat, eat organic or free-range meat.
Meat also contains saturated fat, and many animals were fed hormones
to increase their weight.
 Eat more veggies. Make sure you wash fruit and vegetables thoroughly
and buy organic when you can to avoid pesticides.
 Drink less alcohol. Alcohol is hard on your liver, and a stressed liver
can’t remove toxins and waste products from the body well. (Check out
the section “Cutting back on the drinks” later in this chapter for more
information on reducing your alcohol intake.)
 Consume less caffeine. Caffeine can make you jumpy and irritable; it
also dehydrates you and depletes your vitamin B stores.
 Eat more fiber. Good sources of fiber include oatmeal, fruits and vegeta-
bles, brown rice, beans, and whole grains, excluding wheat.
 Eat less wheat in any form. Some doctors who specialize in endometrio-
sis feel that sensitivity to wheat products is increasing, and that remov-
ing wheat from the diet can decrease pain for endometriosis.
 Eat less soy and fewer soy products. See the “What happened to the joy
of soy?” sidebar in this chapter for more information.
295
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

 Eat less refined sugar. It really has no nutritional benefits, although we
don’t argue that it tastes good!
 Eat more omega-3 fatty-acid-producing oils. Good sources of omega-3
include walnut oil, flaxseed oil, evening primrose, and safflower oil.
 Eat less saturated fat, butter, lard, and animal oils. These fats may
increase your chance of developing heart disease.
 Eat foods that boost the immune system. Healthful, immune-boosting
foods include carrots, beans, lentils, onions, ginger, green tea, and
rhubarb.
Can you wake up tomorrow and transform yourself into a total health freak?
Probably not! In fact, introducing changes slowly, and one at a time, can keep
you from feeling deprived and help you to pinpoint changes that really make
a difference.
Taking supplemental vitamins and minerals
If you have endometriosis, should you take extra vitamin and mineral supple-
ments? Doing so can’t hurt, and they may help — as long as you follow some
general guidelines. And as always, discuss it with your physician before you
start buying bottles off the health-food shelf. If you take several different sup-
plements, you may be duplicating ingredients. And many vitamins (especially
those that are fat soluble) and some minerals are toxic in large amounts. The
following list of vitamins and minerals and their benefits may help you get
started:
296
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 
What happened to the joy of soy?
Not too many years ago, soy was a near-miracle
food. Now, many dieticians and naturopaths
suggest you avoid soy. Why the turnaround?
The list of negative effects of soy has now out-
grown the list of benefits. Among the reasons to
avoid soy products, according to many health
aficionados, are
 Phytic acid in soy may reduce absorption of
calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, and zinc,
all essential minerals.
 Phyoestrogens in soy may disrupt fertility
and increase the risk of breast cancer.
 Phyoestrogens in soy disrupt thyroid 
function.
 Soy products contain high levels of alu-
minum, which is toxic to the kidneys and
nervous system.
 Soy increases the need for vitamins B12
and D.
Have you been drinking soy and assuming you
were health conscious? You may want to recon-
sider. Check with your doctor for her opinion.

 Vitamin A: Boosts the immune system; an antioxidant; helps lessen pro-
fuse menstrual bleeding
 Vitamin B complex: Helps break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats
in the body; helps keep estrogen levels naturally low; helps produce
good prostaglandins
 Vitamin C: Helps boost the immune system and fight off disease; antioxi-
dant; helps control excessive bleeding; detoxifies pollutants
 Vitamin D: Helps retain calcium
 Vitamin E: Boosts the immune system; helps decrease pain from cramps
 Beta carotene: Converts to vitamin A in the body
 Calcium: Deficiency can cause cramping, headaches, and pelvic pain
 Folic acid: Necessary for making healthy red blood cells
 Iron: Prevents anemia, weakness, and fatigue due to heavy bleeding
 Magnesium: Decreases cramping; a muscle relaxant
 Selenium: Boosts immune system; decreases inflammation when taken
with vitamin E
 Zinc: Boosts immune system
If you’re not much of a pill popper, preferring to get your vitamins and miner-
als from food sources, the following list of foods containing vitamins and min-
erals can help you:
 Vitamin A: Apricots, broccoli, cantaloupe, carrots, eggs, milk, pumpkin,
spinach, squash
 Vitamin B: Fortified cereals, beans, red meat, poultry, mollusks, liver
 Vitamin C: Berries, broccoli, cantaloupe, grapefruit, lemons, oranges,
peppers, spinach, strawberries
 Vitamin D: Butter, cheese, eggs, salmon, tuna
 Vitamin E: Almonds, avocado, eggs, safflower oil, salmon, sunflower oil
 Beta carotene: Carrots, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, cantaloupe
 Calcium: Almonds, hard cheese, green beans, kelp, milk
 Folic acid: Asparagus, green leafy vegetables, organ meats
 Iron: Clams, fortified cereals, liver, oysters, lean red meat, dried beans
 Magnesium: Bananas, barley, green beans, kelp, sunflower seeds, rasp-
berry leaves
 Selenium: Cabbage, celery, cucumbers
 Zinc: Ginger root, oysters, lamb chops, pecans

Eating organic
People talk about eating organic foods, but what does organic really mean?
Some people consider organic foods to be anything they buy from the local
fruit and veggie stand. However, in order to be labeled organic, foods, includ-
ing meat, need to meet the following strict criteria of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The foods must be free from
 Conventional pesticides
 Petroleum-based fertilizers
 Irradiation
 Sewage sludge
 Antibiotics and growth hormones
Whether or not organic foods keep you healthier or decrease endometriosis
is a matter of much debate. But if you want to eat as naturally as possible and
avoid chemical exposure, organic foods are a good bet. (Check out the
nearby sidebar, “Locating organic food” in this chapter.)
298
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 
Prostaglandins: The good, the bad, and the painful
Prostaglandins are fatty acids that the body can
manufacture or that you can consume in foods.
Prostaglandins have useful functions that you
can’t live without. But women with endometrio-
sis may produce too many prostaglandins,
resulting in inflammation in tissues and painful
cramping.
Prostaglandins have an interesting history. A
Swedish scientist named Ulf Von Euler discov-
ered them in human semen in the 1930s. He
thought prostaglandins came from the prostate,
hence their name. But prostaglandins are in just
about every type of cell and act as chemical
messengers inside the cell. They don’t travel
around the body.
A number of different prostaglandins, all with
differing functions, are in the human body. Some
prostaglandins activate immune responses and
can cause fever and inflammation. Others help
form blood clots in some places and prevent
their formation in others. Certain prostaglandins
can cause uterine cramping, diarrhea, fever,
and pain. Scientists have identified around a
dozen different types of prostaglandins.
Good and bad prostaglandins are also in foods.
The bad ones are in foods such as dairy and
meat. Good prostaglandins are made from fatty
acids in some marine plants and fish. These are
part of the omega-3 fatty acids. By avoiding the
bad prostaglandins and increasing your intake
of the good ones, you may help alleviate or
lessen your symptoms.

Cutting back on the drinks
Outside of the obvious risks of overindulging in alcohol, such as liver damage,
accidental injury, and making a fool out of yourself at the office holiday party,
alcohol may also be harmful if you have endometriosis.
Alcohol may increase estrogen levels, which can worsen endometriosis
symptoms and encourage growth of endometrial implants. Will an occasional
glass of wine be harmful? Probably not — but monitor your own response.
Does drinking alcohol increase your pelvic pain or cause intestinal problems?
You may want to avoid alcohol altogether if it aggravates your symptoms.
Snuffing out the smokes
Smoking is a serious and dangerous addiction. Around 48 million Americans
smoke, and around 400,000 die each year from causes related to smoking. No
direct proof links smoking to causing or worsening endometriosis, although
many scientists suspect that it may. Smoking has been associated with
changes in the immune system, which is significant because endometriosis is
more and more considered to have an autoimmune component. What is
known is that smoking decreases fertility, and because many endometriosis
patients are also infertility patients, it’s certainly in your best interest to quit
smoking altogether, or at least cut down.
Exercising for Health and Other Benefits
You probably know you should exercise, but exercise is easy to put off until
tomorrow. After all, getting up early to go to the gym or going after work
(when all you want to do is collapse on the couch in front of the television) is
hard work.
299
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis
Locating organic food
Are you interested in eating more organic food
but just don’t know where to look? Check out
www.localharvest.org on the Internet;
by keying in your zip code, you can find places
near you that produce organic products. Or you
can have organic foods delivered right to your
door by going to www.diamondorganics.
com. They even have organic takeout!
These are just two of several online sites for
organic produce. You can even grow your own
organic produce from organic seeds! You pay
more for organically produced food, but if you’re
convinced chemicals are making you sick, your
money is well spent.

Many people are often too tired to exercise, but the irony is that daily exer-
cise can energize and rejuvenate you. Don’t believe it? Many studies show
that exercise has benefits beyond the physical. This section looks at how
exercise can help you feel better, even when your endometriosis symptoms
are acting up.
Understanding the benefits of movement
Do you often find yourself saying, “I’d exercise if I thought it would really
accomplish anything.”? Or are you just so busy that you don’t have even 
20 to 30 minutes a day, three times a week to devote to exercising? Well, to
prove to you that exercise is good for you, consider the following facts:
 Women who have exercised more than two hours a week from an early
age are less likely to develop endometriosis.
 Exercise decreases estrogen levels, which may slow the growth of
endometriosis. Exercise also increases the body’s production of 
endorphins, natural pain-blocking substances.
 Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous to have benefits. Yoga, swimming,
and walking all help release endorphins.
 Exercise reduces stress and tension and helps you sleep better.
 Exercise helps keep your bones strong.
You don’t need to spend a fortune on equipment and devote hours a day to
exercise. Taking even a few small steps toward regular exercise, like a short
daily walk, will encourage you to do more as time goes by.
Taking the first step
Jumping head first into an exercise program like some people do isn’t a good
idea. You know the drill — they decide they should start exercising more, so
they rent ten different exercise videos, buy six new color-coordinated exer-
cise outfits and two new pairs of shoes, buy a pedometer and a pulse moni-
tor, pick up a few dumbbells (color-coordinated to match their outfits), buy a
treadmill and three new exercise magazines, and then . . . collapse on the
couch for a week.
Or a woman may actually start a new exercise program by hitting the gym in
the morning, the track at lunch, and the treadmill in the evening for a week.
But the next week, she needs to see a chiropractor for her back, a podiatrist
for her swollen feet, and an orthopedist for her brand-new stress fracture —
not to mention a marriage counselor for driving her spouse crazy by exercis-
ing at 5 a.m. each morning and a human resource counselor to find a new job
because she’s been falling asleep on the job all week.
300
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

Exercise is good, but make sure you start slowly. Why? Here are just a few of
the reasons:
 You’re less likely to hurt yourself.
 You’re more likely to remain enthusiastic if you don’t burn out in the
first week.
 Your muscles need time to get into condition.
However, before you begin any exercise program, talk to your doctor. She can
advise you about your exercise plans.
If you’re not sure where to start, don’t worry. Exercise doesn’t have to be
complicated; you can start a walking program, exercise to videos, or use a
treadmill at home for next to nothing. You don’t need to join a gym to get in
shape — if you’re motivated enough to design and continue your own exer-
cise regimen at home. If you feel you need the extra push (and you know if
you do), joining a gym may be your best bet. You may consider one step fur-
ther: Hire a personal trainer for at least a few sessions. That extra commit-
ment can make exercising a habit and can ensure that you don’t jump in over
your head just to land on the couch!
Finding Chemically Safe Products
Will cutting down on chemical exposure help control endometriosis? The jury
is still way out on whether chemical exposure causes autoimmune diseases
like endometriosis. But reducing contact with some chemicals certainly can’t
hurt. (See Chapter 4 for more on chemical exposure and endometriosis.)
Many of the foods you eat are contaminated with environmental chemicals.
Compounds migrate from the items to which they were added and build up in
the fat tissue of animals that everyone eats, and eventually end up in people.
Although levels of some dangerous environmental chemicals have actually
dropped over the last few decades, such as bath and paper products, for
example, other chemical levels have risen.
Avoiding chemicals today isn’t as hard as 30 years ago, when people didn’t
know the contents of many products. Every product these days has a label,
and — if your eyesight is good enough — you can read it before you decide
to buy. These are just a few items you can buy chemical-free:
 Bath products
 Bedding
 Cleaning products
 Clothing
301
Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

 Paper products
 Sanitary products
Although you don’t need to buy a gas mask and suit up in chemical gear yet
(unless you’re a member of Homeland Security), you can take the following
steps to reduce your exposure to harmful chemicals in the air, in your food,
and on the ground:
 Wash fruits and vegetables before eating.
 Wash meat, chicken, and fish before eating.
 Skin and trim fat from fish because some contaminants congregate there.
 Open the windows instead of using artificial air fresheners (unless you
live in a polluted area).
 Avoid using chemicals on your lawn — are a few dandelions all that bad?
 Swat bugs instead of spraying them.
 Use natural cleaning products.
 Try chemical-free detergent instead of using dryer sheets.
 Use nonperfumed toilet paper, paper towels, and other paper products.
 Hire a professional instead of trying to remove lead-based paint.
 Stain or seal-pressure treated wood, such as decks or walkways, to avoid
the chemicals they contain.
 Avoid burning trash, even if it’s legal in your area.

ing, try the following sources:

Adjusting Your Sex Life
If you have endometriosis, you probably think your sex life needs some
adjusting. (Actually, most people feel this way!) Unfortunately, endometriosis
can wreak havoc on your sex life by causing pain at a time that should be
most pleasurable.
302
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

Studies have shown that more than 50 percent of women with endometriosis
have pain with intercourse for most of their lives. In addition, women with
endometriosis
 Have intercourse less often
 Have less satisfying orgasms
 Feel less relaxed during intercourse
 Frequently have to stop in the middle of sex due to pain
However, even if you have dyspareunia (pain during sex), you can keep sex in
the pleasure, rather than in the pain, category with modifications that are
easy to pick up and fun to practice!
We want to give you hope that your sex life can be enjoyable and not so
painful. This section gives tips to help you communicate with your partner,
looks at how you can enjoy sex more, and offers suggestions for ways to
spice things up with new positions. Ooh-la-la! Have fun!
Being upfront with your partner
If you have painful sex as a result of endometriosis, be honest and upfront
with your partner. Your partner may think the worst if you don’t explain the
real reason sex doesn’t excite you. Your partner may think that you don’t
have affectionate feelings toward him or her. Or your partner may believe
that you want to be with someone else. And if sex involves pain for you, your
partner is likely to feel guilty for causing you pain, thinking he or she is doing
something wrong.
Guilt and lack of communication can kill any relationship, so being upfront
about endometriosis and its effect on your sex life is paramount. Take your
partner with you to the doctor’s office if necessary, so you both know what’s
going on and can get some ideas on how to overcome pain during sex.
Explain to your partner where and when you feel pain. With your partner, find
a position or other form of lovemaking that’s comfortable for both of you.
Maybe all you need is to avoid certain days. When you communicate this to
your partner, you lessen misinterpretations about your lack of interest at
those certain times.

Chapter 16: Changing Your Lifestyle When You Have Endometriosis

Getting the most out of sex
Do you have endometriosis and want to improve your sex life? Remember the
following:
 Figure out what times of the month are least painful for you. For some
women with endometriosis, ovulation time is least painful. Find what’s
best for you.
 Take some pain medication before getting started. But go easy on
drugs that make you drowsy!
 Use lots of lubricant. Water-based or silicone-based lubricants can help
decrease dryness and painful entry. Many drugs for endometriosis dry
up vaginal secretions.
Trying different positions
When you have endometriosis, just mixing up your sex life and trying differ-
ent positions can help ease the pain. Deep penetration is most likely to cause
pain when you have endometriosis, so try new angles — they may make the
difference between pleasure and pain. You may feel much more comfortable
if you try:
 Being on top
 Lying side by side
 Any position that makes you happy
 Oral sex (giving and receiving)
 Hanging from the rafters (okay, maybe not quite so drastic)
These simple changes and any others that make you more comfortable can
help, if not save, your sex life. Be sure to discuss these ideas with your part-
ner so he or she understands why you’re suddenly kinkier at certain times 
of the month. Knowing why you’re changing the routine can make your part-
ner feel better and just may inspire him or her to find ways to help you feel
better too.

H
aving a chronic illness isn’t fun. No one can argue that. But it’s no fun
sometimes to be the significant other of someone who has a chronic
disease, such as endometriosis. Living with endometriosis day to day can be
stressful, not only for the patient, but also for her family and friends. If you’re
a significant other, a parent, a friend, or a family member, you may feel even
more helpless because you can’t take the burden from your loved one or
truly understand how she feels.
In this chapter, we discuss the frustrations of living with — and loving —
someone who has endometriosis, and discuss ways to make the situation a
bit better — for both of you. We cover topics from helping without hindering
to improving your sex life. We look at how you can be supportive concerning
difficult infertility issues, and we provide information for parents who may
have an adult daughter dealing with endometriosis. Finally, we don’t forget
what support you need. For everyone who cares for someone with
endometriosis, this chapter is for you!

Living with Endometriosis —
Secondhand
Sometimes watching someone you care about suffer is just as difficult as feel-
ing the pain yourself. If someone you care about has endometriosis, you
probably have days where you want to wave a wand and fix all the problems.
You can’t wave a wand, but you can do the next best thing. You can be sup-
portive when she really needs it, when she questions her own feelings, and
when she feels bad about letting you down.
This section tells you how you can be part of the solution without going
down with the ship yourself. We help you understand your loved one’s pain,
provide tips on how you can help without being a nuisance, suggest ways to
keep your sex life on fire, and take a close look at financial issues.
Understanding how endometriosis 
affects her
It’s hard to be on the same page with someone whose symptoms are always
changing. Picture this: Your partner comes into the kitchen, kicks the cat out
of the way, pours herself a cup of coffee, and chugs it in one gulp. You assume
that she’s having a bad day, so, trying to be empathetic, you say, “Poor baby,
are you having cramps again?”
She picks up the nearest newspaper and heaves it at your head. “I don’t have
cramps at this time of the month,” she hisses. “My stomach is killing me!”
Well, how are you supposed to know? You thought endometriosis was mostly
about cramps. Don’t be embarrassed; many people think that’s the only prob-
lem. By reading this chapter, you’re off to the right start to understand better
what your loved one is experiencing. Maybe you’re reading it under duress,
with your partner glaring at you from across the table. She may even have
you chained to a chair. That’s okay. We promise you’ll be glad you read this
chapter (and even the book) in the end.
For starters, you need to know that endometriosis can affect a legion of body
functions. For example, endometriosis can cause a number of symptoms. (We
start with the most common ones.)

Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

As you can see, endometriosis can definitely be more than “just cramps!” To
understand more about how endometriosis can cause pain, check out
Chapter 2 for a more in-depth discussion on symptoms.
Helping without being a pain
You don’t have endometriosis, but you care about someone who does. You
want to help, but some days you feel like you’re only irritating your partner.
She pushes you away when you offer her a back rub. In fact, she may push
you away all together! How do you handle living with a chronic illness that
isn’t yours?
Being able to empathize with your partner can help. But you may be wonder-
ing how to empathize. In truth, the ability to empathize is a rare gift. To
empathize is to say, “I don’t know what you’re going through, but I’m here for
you” without falling into the “You poor thing” or “I know what you’re going
through” trap.

When women with endometriosis were asked what they wanted most from
family and friends, the answer was support. But support is hard to define. The
following list includes some suggestions for supporting your loved one:
 Listen to her (primary to any relationship!). Listening means more 
than saying “Uh huh” occasionally; it means really hearing what she’s
saying — and sometimes reading between the lines to hear what she’s
afraid to say out loud. Listening takes practice.
 Believe her when she says she’s hurting. People who live with a lot of
pain often become good at hiding it, so don’t assume that she’s not
really in pain because she’s not writhing on the floor; she may be
writhing on the inside.
 Be patient with her. It can be annoying to have plans turned upside
down at the last minute by flare-ups, but she doesn’t enjoy having life
topsy-turvy any more than you do.
 Learn about the disease yourself. Understanding what she’s feeling is
the first step to real empathy.
 Don’t blame her for her symptoms. No one chooses to have endometrio-
sis, and she feels bad enough about missing events, staying home from
work, or missing out on family time as it is.
 Don’t make judgments. No “If you would only . . . “ statements. Even if
what you’re saying is true, a positive attitude from you will be much
more motivating than accusations.
 Be committed. No threats to leave when times are bad, which may be
one of her biggest fears.
 Ask what you can do to help — and do it. Even better, although you’ve
worked a long day, do what needs to be done without asking!
 Run interference with other family and friends when she doesn’t feel
up to being with them. Families can take this as rejection; it may be up
to you to clear things up for them.
 Don’t feel like you have to fix everything. No one can be everything to
everyone all the time, and you can wear yourself out trying.
 Give positive feedback. Comments such as, “You’re handling a hard 
situation well” work wonders. Praise is a great motivator!
 Become an expert at giving back rubs or massages. Good ones can
really make a difference!
 Go to doctor visits with her if she asks. You may discover helpful 
information, and understanding what’s going on can help you be more
empathetic.
Accentuate the positive. Sometimes your partner may not be able to think
about the good parts of your lives. But, if you both fall into the same “woe is
us” trap, you’re going to have a very gloomy household. You don’t need to be
308
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

unrealistic or try and bully your partner into feeling better — which never
works anyway. Saying “You should . . .” makes her feel like she’s getting a lec-
ture, and the natural inclination is to become angry or defensive.
Listen, listen, listen!!! Listening is more than having half an ear tuned in; it’s
giving all your attention and really trying to hear what she’s saying beyond the
words themselves. Letting her talk is one of the greatest gifts you can give her.
Coping with the sexual effects 
of endometriosis
Do you want to talk about sex? Maybe not, but you need to if your partner is
suffering from endometriosis. (If the person you love with endometriosis is
your friend or daughter, feel free to skip this section!)
Almost 60 percent of women with endometriosis have sexual problems
directly related to endometriosis. Of course, sex (or lack of sex or unsatisfy-
ing sex) can railroad almost any relationship. So you need to know what you
may be up against with sex and endometriosis.
 Believe that endometriosis can cause real pain during sex. Her claims
aren’t an avoidance tactic.
 Ask her what hurts. The area may vary, depending on the time of the
month.
 Change positions. Deep penetration may be very painful for her. Oral
sex or sex toys may be a better alternative at times.
 Be understanding, even when you’re frustrated. We know this balance
is hard to maintain!
 Be willing to experiment. Sometimes figuring out what works for her
takes time.
 Be committed. Let her know that sex is just a part of your life together
and that you’re not going to throw in the towel because of sexual issues.
 Don’t pressure her. When you have urgent needs she can’t meet at 
the time, don’t storm off threatening to find alternatives. If a cold shower
doesn’t appeal to you, you can release the tension yourself, so to speak.
Okay, it’s not as much fun, but masturbation can do the job when 
necessary.
 Sometimes the pain is talking, not the woman who loves you. Pain
makes people say words they don’t mean. Add guilt to pain and almost
any idea can come out — without really meaning it. Don’t take any
words from the middle of a painful moment to heart.

Chapter 17: Just for Friends and Family: Help and Support

Keeping afloat financially
Endometriosis can be a costly disease. Considering the surgeries, medica-
tions, doctor’s visits, therapy, time off from work, or an inability to keep a job
or to work at all — chronic illness can put a big dent in your financial plan-
ning. Your partner may feel guilty for not being able to carry her financial
share, and you may be frustrated with this situation as well.
Look for ways to work around the financial quagmires. Can your partner work
at home? More and more jobs today allow employees to work outside the
office, at least part of the time. Ask your loved one to discuss such a possibil-
ity with her employer. Many positions, such as medical transcribers, medical
billers, phone sales, and so on, are possible to do from home. These jobs may
not be ideal, but they can help pay the bills.
When your partner isn’t feeling well, she may not be emotionally or physi-
cally able to dive into insurance issues and health plans. But a good plan can
save you a lot of money, so make sure the plan you choose covers the
expenses you’re likely to have. Many companies offer more than one option
to choose from. The cheapest, not surprisingly, may not be the best for you.
Then again, it may be!
Know your insurance coverage so you can fight denials when necessary. Yes,
the language is obscure, and calls to insurance companies can eat up hours
of time. But saving co-pays or fighting denials can be worth your time and
effort, especially if you’re on a tight budget.
I have had patients whose insurance companies denied their claims for
obscure reasons. In several cases related to endometriosis, I have gone to bat
for my patients and helped them get payment. Ask your doctor to help by
writing letters, or get a lawyer involved. Sometimes a letter from the doctor
or a lawyer can expedite payment.
Keep good financial records and don’t throw away any correspondence from
your insurance company until you’re sure you don’t need it. (Keep your
records for at least three years, if you’re claiming large expenses on your tax
returns, three years if you’re not claiming a large deduction.) Taking all the
legal deductions that you’re entitled to on tax returns requires documentation.
Persevering Through Infertility
Treatments Together
We’ve both spent years working with infertile patients and found that this
area can really make or break a relationship. Because so many women with
endometriosis suffer from some form of infertility, you and your loved one
310
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

may face this problem as well. Please believe us when we say that your life
(and relationship) can be easier if you face the challenges together.
Finding out that you may have trouble conceiving can be devastating. Most
people assume that having children is an inalienable right and they’re
shocked to find out it may not be that easy. Families dealing with infertility go
through all the stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, and rationalization
before acceptance and dealing with the problem face on. (See Chapter 7 for a
complete rundown on infertility issues that endometriosis can cause.)
What can you do to help your partner through this difficult time of trying to
get pregnant? You can show the same support as you do with the rest of her
problems (check out “Helping without being a pain” earlier in this chapter),
plus a few more:
 Avoid the blame game. Your partner feels bad enough about the infertil-
ity. Don’t make the matter worse by pointing your finger. Besides, infer-
tility can have many factors, including problems on your part.
 Keep a positive attitude. Endometriosis doesn’t mean you’ll never have
children; treatments are available to help you.
 Expect mood swings if your partner is on hormone medication. Yes,
more mood swings! Mood swings are inevitable when you’re taking
potent hormones.
 Understand the elements of the process. You may find parts of the
infertility treatment highly unpleasant, such as giving your partner injec-
tions and producing semen on demand in the doctor’s office. But when
you understand why certain steps are necessary, you may accept them
more easily.
 Be aware that infertility treatments can change sex from enjoyment to
duty. Try to keep the romance in sex when you’re in the middle of fertility
treatments. Your partner may be so focused on the end result (a baby)
that she can’t see the forest for the trees. Sexual pleasure may be the last
thought on her mind when she says, “Tonight’s the night!” You may need
to make the evening enjoyable and pleasurable, despite the timetable.
Infertility treatments add another layer of pressure to a life that’s already
stressful. For example, just knowing that you have to give your partner injec-
tions can cause your stress level to go through the roof when you’re already
concerned about the expense, the travel time, lost time from work, the emo-
tional toll, and whether or not the treatment will work.
The middle of infertility treatments isn’t the time to remodel the bathroom,
plan a cross-country move, or start a new business. Keep outside distrac-
tions to a minimum, and both of you will be in much better shape to deal with
the stresses of parenthood in a few months! (For more information on fertility
issues, check out Fertility For Dummies by Jackie Meyers-Thompson and
yours truly, Sharon Perkins [Wiley].)

Just for Moms and Dads: Being There 
for Your Adult Daughter
Parents have a hard time dealing with an adult child’s chronic illness. If your
child has endometriosis, you may vacillate between an “Oh, poor baby” and a
“Just get over it” attitude, with feelings of guilt for good measure. Parents can
forget their children are still children and, unknowingly, cause hurt feelings.
Believe it or not, even as adults, your children are looking for your approval
on some level.
So how do you handle the ongoing issues of endometriosis in your adult
child’s life? You can
 Remember that your child is an adult. This advice means that she has
the right to make her own decisions (even if you know they’re the wrong
ones).
 Keep your mouth shut when the occasion warrants it. When is that?
Every time you start to say, “I think you should . . .” when your child
hasn’t asked.
 Remember that your child still cares about your opinion. If you think
she’s making huge mistakes in the way she’s dealing with endometriosis,
stay quiet unless the result is life threatening or she asks you what you
think. When she does ask, be tactful. Talk to her like you talk to a friend,
not a toddler.
 Don’t tell a personal story (especially negative ones) every time she
starts to tell you about her situation. Your child may not want to hear
about the horrible pain Aunt Jenny had with her periods, or how your
friend’s insides were all stuck together before she had surgery. Just
listen without playing “Can you top this story?”
 Stay positive, especially if your child is trying to get pregnant. Don’t
bemoan the fact that it’s taking so long for her to give you a grandchild.
Never ever offer advice in this area unless specifically asked!
 Learn about endometriosis. This book is a good place to start.
Researchers have discovered much about this disease in the last 20
years and have made many advances in treatment. The scenarios aren’t
the same as poor Aunt Jenny’s 30 years ago.
 Try not to feel guilty. Even if this disease runs in the family, it’s not your
fault. Many factors influence endometriosis; family history is just one of
them. You may be feeling guiltier if you pooh-poohed your daughter’s
symptoms when she was a teenager. You did the best you could.
312
Part IV: Living with Endometriosis 

Finding Support for Yourself
You may have days where you’re feeling left out, wondering why no one cares
about your feelings and aches and pains. Trust us, someone does. Who? Your
mother, for one, and your partner does too, even though she may be in pain.
A whole lot of people are in the same boat you are and want to know that
their feelings are normal, too. These subjects don’t easily come up at work or
in the gym, though. People just don’t stand around the water cooler, talking
about their partner’s cramps, irregular bleeding, or infertility issues.
So where can you go to talk about the frustrations and difficulties of dealing
with endometriosis secondhand? The easiest way to find people to talk to,
even in the wee hours of the morning, is the Internet. You can always access
it, and the Internet is popular with insomniacs, so you can almost always find
someone who’s willing to talk.
The following Web sites are available for information and support just for
partners of women with endometriosis:
 http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/Spa/8449/
 http://www.endometriosis.org.uk/partners/index.htm
As you can see, there’s a need for more Web sites just for support people 
to talk about endometriosis. Are you an Internet geek? Start a board of your
own — or visit the endometriosis sites listed in Appendix B and see if you
can start a support-person’s site.
In addition, some women’s groups welcome family and friends wanting to
understand the disease better (although other groups are strictly for the
person with endometriosis). Some groups have a moderator, some don’t. You
can find out a lot just by listening to fellow endometriosis sufferers chatting
with each other. They tell each other their thoughts, even ones that they may
be embarrassed to tell you!
How else can you help yourself? Try the following:
 Give yourself permission to grieve. A chronic illness in a loved one
means the loss of certain hopes and dreams. The stages of grief —
denial, anger, bargaining, rationalization, and acceptance — take time.
 Give yourself permission to be angry at times. However, keep your
anger directed at the disease itself, not at the person who has it.
 Give yourself time off. Don’t allow endometriosis to be the center of
your life or your partner’s. Plan fun activities to do when she’s up to it.
Find hobbies that can take you away from the stress of chronic illness.
313
Chapter 17: Just for Friends and Family: Help and Support

 Think about the issues one day at a time. Some of the effects of
endometriosis can be devastating, financially and emotionally, for both
you and your partner. When you try to think about all the issues at once,
the problems can overwhelm you. Long-term plans are fine, but realize
that they may need to adapt to unforeseen changes.
 Keep a journal. Even if you’re not the expressive type, getting your feel-
ings down on paper can help. Many men have never kept a journal, but
recording your thoughts and emotions can be a great tension reliever.
And reading what you wrote a year or two ago can also help you realize
that circumstances do change. What upset you a year ago may never
enter your mind now. Seeing change and growth in your own life can be
positive reinforcement!
Who should you not pour out your troubles to? We suggest you not share
your feelings with people who may hold your comments against you or your
partner, or take sides. This list may include your closest relatives; they have
to be very strong people not to fall into the trap of sympathizing with you
and holding some type of resentment toward your partner. If you think your
own relatives can’t listen without becoming judgmental, don’t tell all. Yes, tea
and sympathy from your nearest and dearest can be wonderful, but not at the
expense of their relationship with your partner.

Ten Myths about Endometriosis
In This Chapter
 Endometriosis is a minor problem
 Just certain women get endometriosis
 The solutions for endometriosis are simple
 You just can’t get pregnant if you have endometriosis
E
ndometriosis is often a misunderstood disease. Ask your friends what
they know about endometriosis, and you’re likely to hear a list of miscon-
ceptions. Even your doctor may not truly understand endometriosis.
This chapter examines ten of the most common misconceptions about
endometriosis, so feel free to hand it to anyone who tries to misinform you.
Endometriosis Is All in Your Head
Even doctors used to believe that endometriosis was a psychological disease.
The prevailing attitude was that, if you just stopped thinking about yourself
all the time, all the pain would disappear. Some doctors actually believed that
a woman’s positive attitude would make the pain go away. Unfortunately,
some professionals still use this rationale today.
Although a positive attitude is certainly good to have throughout your life,
you probably know that attitude doesn’t decrease your endometriosis one
bit. Endometriosis isn’t just in your head (although it can be; endometriosis
has been found in the brain! See Chapter 6 for more info) — it’s in your
pelvis, and it hurts.

Endometriosis Is Just Cramps
Although your significant other may think your endometriosis is just a case
of really bad cramps, you know the difference. Endometriosis can affect many
parts of your body, and symptoms can occur at any time of the month, not
just during your period. Endometriosis can cause permanent damage to 
your ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowels, bladder, and any other body part it
attaches to.
Of all the misguided attitudes about endometriosis, this one is the most dan-
gerous because it may lead you to ignore your symptoms until they’ve done
permanent damage. (See Chapter 2 for more on ways to differentiate between
endometriosis and other diseases that cause similar symptoms.) As doctors
and the public become more educated about the far-reaching consequences
of endometriosis, the myth of endometriosis as just cramps will be perma-
nently debunked.
If you suffer debilitating cramps, don’t wait another minute. Call your gyne-
cologist immediately for an exam to see whether you have endometriosis or
some other ailment. The earlier you know, the better.
Only Women Get Endometriosis
Just imagine if men worried about getting endometriosis. Congress probably
would pass legislation approving millions of dollars of research for a cure,
right? You may be surprised, but men can actually get endometriosis. Of
course, these occurrences are rare because endometriosis usually appears in
men who take high doses of estrogen hormones for diseases such as prostate
cancer, but it can happen.
Teenagers Don’t Get Endometriosis
Girls as young as 11 years old have been diagnosed with endometriosis.
Because girls now start menstruating at an earlier age than they did in past
decades, their endometriosis is occurring at a younger age too. (See Chapter 14
for more info.) And because endometriosis was considered a career woman’s
disease up until the 1980s, physicians didn’t consider looking for it in teenage
girls who had the symptoms. In the past, many doctors thought bad cramps
were just part of being a woman. Now, however, more and more doctors are
testing teenagers who have symptoms, and the diagnosis is frequently
endometriosis.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Endometriosis Goes Away at Menopause
Although the symptoms of endometriosis often decrease at menopause
because estrogen levels drop, some doctors and researchers have found
endometriosis in women in their 70s. In fact, some women are first diagnosed
with endometriosis in menopause, usually because endometriosis is found at
the time of surgery for chronic pelvic pain or for unrelated reasons.
Endometriosis Is a Career 
Woman’s Disease
The concept of endometriosis being a career woman’s disease is an old
wives’ tale based on the premise that only driven, Type-A personalities got
endometriosis. This myth is a twisted version of “it’s all in your head,” but it
adds the dig, “You brought this problem on yourself by being a driven career
woman.” The attitude probably gained credence when career women started
trying to get pregnant at a later age than traditional homemakers. If the older
woman had trouble getting pregnant, endometriosis was often the cause.
In fact, no relationship has ever been proven; women from every socioeco-
nomic and racial group can have endometriosis, whether they’re working in
the office or at home (check out Chapter 1 for more statistics about who gets
endometriosis).
Endometriosis Only Exists in
Industrialized Countries
This statement is a variation of the career woman myth. In the past, experts
believed endometriosis was a disease only in industrialized countries where
exposure to toxic chemicals was rampant. But researchers haven’t proven
this theory. Women in third-world countries have endometriosis, but, without
the resources to obtain treatment, they’re less likely to be diagnosed. These
women also tend to have children at a younger age, which helps keep symp-
toms at bay longer. (See Chapter 4 for more on how and why pregnancy
affects your chances of having endometriosis.)
319
Chapter 18: Ten Myths about Endometriosis

A Hysterectomy Cures Endometriosis
A hysterectomy (the removal of your uterus) doesn’t cure endometriosis,
unless the endometriosis is only in the uterus. Although a hysterectomy
stops menstrual bleeding because the blood comes from the uterine lining,
the surgery doesn’t change the endometriosis on your ovaries, bowel, blad-
der, or elsewhere in your pelvic cavity.
However, hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries will permanently get rid
of endometriosis symptoms in most women, because removing the ovaries
removes most of the hormonal stimulation that activates endometrial
implants, wherever they’re found. Unfortunately, the surgical menopause 
that results has a multitude of additional symptoms to cope with (refer to
Chapter 11 for more info).
Endometriosis Is Easy to See and 
Remove during Surgery
Although your doctor may be able to see endometriosis during surgery, she
may not recognize and thus remove all the implants. Studies have shown that
surgeons are able to accurately visualize and diagnose only 60 percent of
endometriosis. Unfortunately, endometriosis may look like other conditions,
such as scar tissue; furthermore, other conditions, such as tumors, may look
like endometriosis and can only be differentiated by biopsy.
You Can’t Get Pregnant If You 
Have Endometriosis
Even if you have endometriosis, you can get pregnant. In fact, 60 to 70 per-
cent of women with endometriosis do conceive, but they may have a harder
time than a woman without the disease. Although some women with
endometriosis get pregnant easily, others need to see a fertility specialist
(see Chapter 7 for more on fertility issues). The bottom line: If you want to
have kids and you have endometriosis, see a specialist and, if at all possible,
have babies sooner rather than later in life.

Ten (Or So) Trends in the Future 
of Endometriosis
In This Chapter
 Looking at what the future holds
 Picking apart genes for clues to endometriosis
W
hat does the future hold for endometriosis? Endometriosis has more
research going on now than at any other time in history, and more
research means hope for earlier detection, better diagnosis, and more effec-
tive ways to treat it without damaging future fertility. Are you ready to jump
into the future? Some of this chapter may be too technical for you. However,
if you’re interested, this chapter shows what the future holds. Hang on; it
may be a wild ride!
Determining the Source of Endometriosis
Scientists are now challenging many long-accepted theories about endometrio-
sis. The theory that retrograde menstruation (menstrual blood that flows back-
wards, up, and out of the fallopian tubes; see Chapter 4 for more info) causes
endometriosis may be true in some cases, or it may be a contributing factor.
But most likely retrograde menstruation isn’t the only cause of endometriosis.
This one theory can’t explain the many variations of endometriosis.
In fact, many experts feel that endometriosis may be a generic term to
describe two or more diseases. That is, the slow-growing, annoying-but-not-
life-altering endometriosis may be a whole different disease than the aggres-
sive, painful, debilitating disease some women have. And why do some
women’s symptoms recur more quickly and other women’s symptoms don’t?
Is the difference between the women, or is it within the disease? Researchers
are working on answering these questions.

Identifying Endometriosis Genes
Endometriosis is likely to involve genetics because a woman has an increased
risk of developing endometriosis if a close relative also has it. Studies suggest
that the disease involves several different genes, each playing a unique role.
But environmental factors may also be necessary to activate the genes that
predispose a woman to develop endometriosis (much like some cancers are
genetic based and activated by environmental factors). As the ability to find
genes and genetic markers evolves, researchers will be able to identify
endometriosis genes.
Recent studies have shown that many genes in the endometrium of women
with endometriosis act abnormally. Scientists can plot hundreds of genes and
their activity during the menstrual cycle. In normal women, certain genes are
more active at specific times and then decrease at other times. Research has
found that this sequence of gene activation and deactivation is different in
women with endometriosis. Our ability to identify and measure these
sequences may help diagnose endometriosis in the future.
More recently, researchers have found a chromosome marker in women with
endometriosis. This chromosome, specifically 10q26, is probably only one of
many that will be found in the future. If researchers can detect this chromo-
some in the blood, then perhaps diagnosis of endometriosis can be easier,
based on a simple blood test.
Other researchers are working on different possible markers in the blood-
stream, making them easy to find with a blood test. One of these is elevated
in some white blood cells of women with endometriosis. If scientists can
establish normal and abnormal levels of these markers and others, they can
use them in the future to diagnose the disease earlier and more easily.
Overcoming Infertility in Endometriosis
Researchers have associated endometriosis with infertility for years — a logical
connection because 35 to 50 percent of infertile women also have endometrio-
sis. However, new research into the causes of infertility in endometriosis shows
that some women with endometriosis lack the molecules that allow embryos to
attach to the uterine lining. Obviously, if the embryo can’t attach, this problem
prevents pregnancy even though fertilization may occur.
This study also indicates that some genes in the uterus of endometriosis
patients appear to function abnormally. As a result, infertility in endometrio-
sis patients appears to be much more complicated than originally thought.
Infertility isn’t just the result of blocked fallopian tubes or other mechanical
factors. The uterine lining may also have an inherent defect that prevents
pregnancy.

For women with severe infertility problems related to endometriosis, embryo
freezing can be a godsend. Eggs can be taken during an egg retrieval cycle
and fertilized with the partner’s sperm. The embryos produced this way can
be stored for many years until the time is right for a pregnancy. This process
can help those women who may lose their eggs over time due to endometrio-
sis. Embryo freezing may also allow women to wait for better treatments for
endometriosis to be developed in the future. In rare cases, these frozen
embryos can be implanted into another woman without the disease, which
allows the affected woman to have a child with her own genes even if she has
lost her uterus because of endometriosis. Oocyte (egg) freezing (cryopreserv-
ing just the unfertilized egg; more research is being done in this area) may be
a viable alternative for women with endometriosis who don’t have a partner,
and will have the same benefits as embryo freezing.
Diagnosing Endometriosis Earlier
At one time, scientists thought that teens rarely developed endometriosis
and that preteens never did. Researchers have now proven these notions
incorrect. The earlier that doctors can diagnose teens and preteens, the ear-
lier treatment can begin and the more damage can be minimized.
Diagnosing and starting treatment early is vital to maintain a teen’s future fer-
tility and to decrease symptoms and damage to organs. So, awareness of the
disease and its symptoms, along with an accurate family history of the dis-
ease, is important. In addition, newer blood tests for chromosomes, antibod-
ies, and other proteins may provide earlier detection.
Refining Medication Treatments
Research into new medications for treatment of endometriosis is exciting.
Much research centers on targeting specific causes of endometriosis rather
than using medications that may sometimes have harmful systemic effects on
body systems outside the reproductive system. In the future, scientists may
find additional uses for selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The
SERMs can affect the way estrogen interacts with the cell receptors in
endometriosis lesions. Aromatase inhibitors (AI) target aromatase, the final
enzyme in the estrogen-biosynthesis pathway. These AI medications selec-
tively decrease estrogen production in endometriotic lesions without affect-
ing ovarian function.
Other treatments may block progesterone and other hormones that have an
effect on endometriosis. These new classes of medications may have fewer
side effects, and patients may tolerate them better than present treatments.
323
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Trends in the Future of Endometriosis

Still newer and different treatments may come. Botox (yes, the wrinkle cure!)
has been tried in a small number of patients with some success. We never
know what can be next!
Improving Immune Therapy
Immune therapy is still in its infancy in treating endometriosis. (See Chapter
12 for more about immunotherapy.) Although use of immune therapy for
cancer treatment is common, doctors don’t use it as much as they could to
treat autoimmune diseases. This reluctance stems from the potentially seri-
ous side effects. After all, who wants to treat a disease and have side effects
that are potentially life-threatening and worse than the disease itself? New,
less destructive and dangerous drugs may make immune therapy more
acceptable for endometriosis.
Gaining Respect for Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a disease that affects more women than any other disease in
the United States. But do you see ads for endometriosis awareness on televi-
sion or telethons to raise money for research? No! Why is that? The answer is
simple: In the past, doctors and lay persons alike have treated endometriosis
more as an emotional problem than a medical one.
Scientists and medical personnel are just beginning to realize how compli-
cated and debilitating endometriosis can be. In the near future, we hope to
see more awareness of the problem and a greater emphasis on its research,
understanding, and treatment in both the medical profession and the public.
Starting More Organizations to Help
In Appendix B, we list some organizations that can help people deal with
endometriosis. The more awareness women have of the disease, the sooner
women can seek help. And the more organizations that develop, the more
women can get the help — physically and emotionally — that they need.
No endometriosis associations in your area? Think about starting one! Place
ads in local gynecologists’ offices or on grocery store bulletin boards and get
together with fellow sufferers to talk about endometriosis and compare notes
on treatments and medications.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Getting Insurers to Help Cover the Costs
In the past, insurance companies have been leery about covering the costs
associated with endometriosis. You may wonder why. Most insurance compa-
nies exist to make money. The less they have to pay out in benefits, the more
they make. You may have read or seen stories about people fighting with
insurance companies to get payment for new or unusual treatments for some
disease. These treatments are often expensive and not mainstream, so the
insurers try not to pay.
Unfortunately, endometriosis is in this category. So if the public or govern-
ment doesn’t pressure insurers to pay for mental health care or issues that
only affect women, not men, these insurers often refuse to cover them. Some
states have begun to mandate that insurers cover certain diseases like infer-
tility, and we hope all problems will be insured in the future.
The trick is to convince the insurance companies that they’ll still make 
billions of dollars even if they fully cover endometriosis testing and treat-
ment. This convincing may take governmental prodding, but, as awareness of
endometriosis and its impact on women’s health grows, we hope the insurers
will understand that diagnosing endometriosis early and treating it fully are
also in the insurers’ best interests.
Transplanting Ovaries and 
Other Reproductive Organs
Transplantation works for kidneys, hearts, lungs, and corneas. Is the day
coming when surgeons can routinely transplant ovaries, uteri, and fallopian
tubes as well? Ovarian transplants already exist; in fact, transplanted ovaries
have provided eggs for healthy pregnancies. However, in this case the child
wasn’t genetically related to the woman.
Surgeons have performed at least one uterine transplant, but the uterus
worked for only a few months before the patient’s body rejected it. One prob-
lem with transplanting reproductive organs is that women must take anti-
rejection drugs, which have powerful side effects. These drugs also can’t be
used during a pregnancy because they would harm the fetus. Because having
a uterus isn’t a necessity unless a woman wants to become pregnant and
doesn’t want to use a gestational carrier, taking anti-rejection drugs just to
keep a uterus transplant isn’t practical at the moment. But in the future —
anything’s possible!
325
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Trends in the Future of Endometriosis

Decreasing Surgical Risks
One risk of surgery to treat endometriosis is that it tends to create more
adhesions, or scar tissue. So the treatment itself can cause more problems
down the road. The following changes may make surgery less likely to create
adhesions in the future:
 Laparoscopy rather than laparotomy (see Chapter 11 for the differences
between the two types of surgeries) for many surgical procedures
 The development of anti-adhesion barriers like sprays, gels, liquids, and
patches to prevent adhesion-formation
Surgical treatment for endometriosis must also take future fertility into
account. Surgeons must first understand the disease so they don’t do more
harm than good. In addition, surgeons need increased training to develop
safer surgical skills when dealing with endometriosis.
The riskiest part of any surgery used to be anesthesia. Recent advances in
techniques and instrumentation have made laparoscopy possible with lighter
and even local anesthesia. Surgeries will become safer and easier in the
future as techniques and instruments improve.
Even when a patient needs general anesthesia, newer anesthetics make it
very safe and reduce side effects markedly. No longer do anesthesiologists
use large doses of narcotics and sodium pentothal (with all the nausea,
drowsiness, and other terrible side effects). Now, small doses of quick-acting
medications that have minimal side effects have become the standard.

Ten Strategies to Help 
with the Pain
In This Chapter
 Anticipating pain and avoiding the onset
 Managing your meds
 Pampering yourself to decrease pain
 Using your head
P
ain is just that — a pain. It can serve a valuable purpose in life when it
lets you know something’s wrong, but presumably you’re beyond that.
What you want are some quick ideas for handling pain when you’re not in the
mood for a long dissertation. This chapter gives you some quick fixes for
those days when your pain is nearly unbearable.
Planning to Avoid Pain
You may think avoiding the pain is impossible; after all, if you could avoid
pain, you would, right? But are you doing all you can to keep the pain from
starting? Are you
 Anticipating when pain may begin? If you’ve had pain that starts three
days before your period every month for the last 12 months, you can
pretty much count on having pain three days before your period this
month too. Are you ready?
 Warding the pain off by taking anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibupro-
fen, before it begins? Studies have shown that taking anti-inflammatory
drugs before pain starts is more effective in decreasing pain than waiting
until it begins. (See Chapter 13 for more on pain relief and endometriosis.)
 Scheduling acupuncture, massage therapy, or whatever works for you
before the pain even starts? See Chapter 12 for more on alternative
treatments.

 Eating well, exercising moderately, and avoiding stress (as best you
can) just before you regularly have pain? Studies have shown that
exercise and stress avoidance can help reduce symptoms.
 Avoiding your triggers? By keeping a journal of symptoms, you may dis-
cover certain conditions bring on or worsen the pain.
Jumping on Pain the Minute It Begins
All right, so you waited a day too long to ward off the pain, and now it’s
already started. Don’t let it get out of hand. Use your big guns upfront and a
little pain may never develop into a bigger one. As soon as you feel a little dis-
comfort, go into de-stress mode:
 Take a warm bath
 Take an anti-inflammatory medication
 Get a massage
 Forget about that nonessential meeting after work
You may be tempted to ignore a little pain, hoping it’ll just go away (even
though it never does). Don’t ignore it; getting rid of that little pain may be
much easier than getting rid of a big one.
Keeping Medications You Need on Hand
Discovering that you’re out of your regular pain medication on the Friday
evening of a holiday weekend definitely isn’t good. In fact, trying to call in a
prescription when you’re writhing in pain isn’t a good idea either. You scream
at your doctor’s receptionist because you’re hurting, so she puts your call on
the bottom of the doctor’s callback pile. (Not really — most doctors’ recep-
tionists are very nice people!)
You’re never going to feel like driving to the drugstore when you’re in pain, so
make sure you always have the pain meds you need.
Soaking in a Hot Tub
Don’t jump in the lake — and don’t even jump in the tub. Try lowering your-
self gently into a warm tub of water up to your chin, and don’t forget the
pillow for your head, a candle for soft light, and a relaxing CD. Moist heat
helps your tense muscles relax.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t have a tub? Fill a hot-water bottle, cover it with a towel warmed in the
microwave, and lie down. Go one step further and put a warm washcloth
across your forehead. Then listen to some relaxing music and use guided
imagery to escape to a more pleasant place, where the word pain doesn’t
even exist. Sound corny? Don’t knock them till you’ve tried them; these relax-
ation tips really may help. (See Chapter 12 for more on techniques to reduce
pain without medication.)
Massaging Away the Pain
A gentle massage can help you and your tight muscles relax. Always ask your
doctor before you undergo any type of deep massage. Stay away from rough
massages, which can send you off the table when you’re in pain.
You don’t know anyone who can give you a massage? A hand-held massager
may not be quite as good as having someone else do the honors, but it can
help in a pinch.
Breathing Slow and Easy
Pain may feel like a never-ending cycle. The pain makes you tense, the ten-
sion makes you breathe harder, and the hard breathing makes you more
tense. To alleviate some of your pain, concentrate on breathing slow and
easy.
Have you ever had a child? If so, do you remember the breathing techniques
for the pain during childbirth? All right, so they don’t work 100 percent, but
they can help you relax. Never been to a childbirth class? The technique is
simple: Breathe in and out slowly, emptying your lungs completely before
taking another breath. And don’t worry — no one’s going to be grading your
technique!
Using Your Imagination
Breathe slowly and pretend you’re somewhere else, with no pain or stress.
Guided imagery may sound a little hokey, but it really works for many people.
Imagine yourself on a quiet, balmy, warm island. If imagining a piña colada in
your hand works, feel free. In fact, if you actually have a piña colada in your
hand, feel free. After all, you’re on an island, aren’t you?
329
Chapter 20: Ten Strategies to Help with the Pain

Talking It Over
Sometimes a listening ear is just what you need. Talking away stress and frus-
tration to your partner, your best friend, your shrink, or a higher power may
help you relax. If you want to complain, go ahead. But try not to get all hot
and bothered, which can make you tense, which can cause muscle spasms,
which can increase the pain — another vicious circle.
Talking online with other people in the same boat or finding a support group
that meets monthly can be a godsend when you have that “no one under-
stands what I’m going through” feeling. And that conversation’s a lot cheaper
than paying someone to listen to you too! (Check out Appendix B for informa-
tion about online resources.)
Trying a Little Laughter
Studies have shown that laughter really is one of the best medicines; yet one
study showed that the average adult laughs only 17 times a day. Children, on
the other hand, laugh more than 300 times a day! Laughter can decrease 
pain by releasing endorphins, relaxing muscle tension, and taking you out of
yourself for a little while. Some studies show that laughter may even boost
your immune system, making you less likely to become ill in the first place!
So rent some comedies and save the tear jerkers for another time.
Knowing What Works for You
You’re not like everyone else; what works for your Aunt Jane’s cramps may
do nothing for you. Try different suggestions until you find a plan that works
for you, and then stick to it. Don’t worry about trying all your relatives’ home
remedies — you may find out that the medicine bottle Granny Annie sips
from all day long is actually straight scotch.
When other people know you’re in pain, you end up listening to everyone’s
suggestions. Giving fresh ideas a try doesn’t hurt, as long as you remember
that you’re the only person who can know what works for you.

Resources and Support
I
f you have endometriosis, suspect you have endometriosis, or even have a
loved one who has endometriosis, you probably aren’t satisfied with read-
ing one book; you want to know everything you can. Although we provide a
lot of information in this book, we realize it isn’t comprehensive, especially if
you want to know more in-depth information about a particular topic. Just in
case you’re itching for more stuff, this appendix points out other valuable
sources of information, including professional organizations, online
resources, books, and so on. In this appendix, we tell you how to uncover
next to everything about endometriosis — short of going to medical school
and getting a degree in gynecology.
Looking for an Organization
Organizations for people with endometriosis were uncommon just a few
decades ago. But endometriosis is now recognized as a real disease. Support
continues to build for research and organizations that are devoted to inform-
ing and helping those who need it.
The granddaddy of all organizations is the Endometriosis Association
founded by Mary Lou Ballweg in 1980. This organization runs support groups,
publishes literature, offers tapes and videos, supports research, publishes
books, runs chat rooms, and issues a newsletter. You can contact the

Flipping through Books
In addition to this helpful book in your two hands, you can find other books
on endometriosis, although many of them may have a particular slant. Some
emphasize diet and nutrition; some focus on fertility issues. Others emphasize
only lung and colon endometriosis or holistic healing and endometriosis. For
general endometriosis information, you may want to check out the following:
 Endometriosis: The Complete Reference for Taking Charge of Your Health
by Mary Lou Ballweg (McGraw-Hill)
 Coping with Endometriosis: A Practical Guide by Robert Phillips (Avery)
 Living Well with Endometriosis: What Your Doctor Doesn’t Tell You...That
You Need to Know by Kerry-Ann Morris (Collins)
If you’re not satisfied with these books and you’re the scholarly type, take a
look at these two textbooks on endometriosis. They may satisfy your desire
to know everything:
 Modern Management of Endometriosis by Christopher Sutton (Taylor and
Francis). This 448-page tome for medical professionals can probably
answer all your questions — but you may need someone to translate
medicalese into English! Most textbooks are quite technical, but if you’re
determined or have some medical knowledge, you can learn a lot from
these books. Although they’re not available in your local bookstore, you
can order them from most online bookstores. But these textbooks don’t
come cheap; this one is around $230.
 Endometriosis in Clinical Practice by David Olive (Taylor and Francis).
Want to know what your doctor reads to learn about endometriosis?
Come in with this book under your arm and watch him wince! (Seriously,
leave the book at home — a nervous doctor is generally not a helpful
doctor. But you can read it surreptitiously before you go into the office
and then dazzle him with your knowledge.)
Reading Newsletters
Want to make sure you know the latest news in endometriosis as soon as it
becomes available? Newsletters that update you on a regular basis can keep
you in the know. In addition to the online groups mentioned earlier in this
appendix, the following sites also offer regular newsletters:
 www.remedyfind.com is an Internet site providing information on a
number of diseases, including endometriosis. If you sign up, they send a
free newsletter via e-mail every other month with information on
endometriosis.
343
Appendix B: Resources and Support

 www.webmd.com also offers newsletters on women’s health issues as
well as articles, bulletin boards, and all the latest information on a
number of health issues.
Getting Involved in Clinical Trials
Do you want to become part of cutting-edge technology, help test new drugs,
or be involved with research on endometriosis? You don’t have to be a 
scientist — you can participate as a patient in trials all across the country.
Don’t know where to look? Start at www.centerwatch.com/patient/
studies/cat60.html for a list of clinical trials across the United States as
well as information on tests and patient requirements. If you’ve always
wanted to do something to further endometriosis treatment and help other
women, here’s your chance!
Attending Meetings and Support Groups
If you do better with face-to-face contact than chatting online or reading a
book, you can search your area for meetings and support groups for
endometriosis sufferers. How do you find support groups that meet live and
in person? Check your local hospital for monthly meetings, or ask your gyne-
cologist if she knows of any support groups. When all else fails, start your
own group!
Asking Relatives and Friends
If you have endometriosis, chances are someone in your family has it too.
(See Chapter 4, which discusses the possible hereditary links to endometrio-
sis.) Your mother, aunt, sister, or cousin may be able to give you insight into
the disease and how she deals with it. Because you’re related, the sugges-
tions may work for you too. Don’t be afraid to talk to your relatives about
your problems.
Likewise, you may know someone who has endometriosis, and she may be
too shy to tell everyone about her disease. If you can bring up your troubles
in a subtle way, she may open up to you. By sharing resources, you can help
each other deal with endometriosis.
