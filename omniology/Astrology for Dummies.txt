Dedication
For George, always


Author’s Acknowledgments
Two Capricorns deserve extravagant praise: my husband, George, and my
editor, Chrissy Guthrie. Both are thoughtful, serious, organized, kind, and a
lot more fun than is generally advertised for that sign. I also want to thank
Tracy Boggier, who reintroduced me to the For Dummies way of life; Ethel
Winslow, who is a fine astrologer as well as an editor; and others at Wiley,
including Jessica Smith, David Lutton, the people in Composition Services,
and Christy Beck, whose behind-the-scenes presence was always a comfort.
Without Reid Boates, this book would not exist.

Introduction
A
strology can change your life. It did mine. Astrology illuminates the
secret corners of the self, provides a key to understanding others, 
contributes a useful method for scrutinizing relationships, and even offers 
a glimpse into the future. Beyond that, as with all great areas of knowledge,
astrology has the power to alter perception. Once you know something about
it, you never see the world in the same way again.
Using a vocabulary that’s both objective and poetic, astrology enlarges your
curiosity (because after you absorb its principles, everyone you meet, no
matter how dull the person or how fleeting the encounter, becomes a mys-
tery waiting to be solved); it expands your insight into behavior and motiva-
tion; and most of all, it increases your compassion. Some people think that
astrology divides all human beings into 12 groups. How wrong they are!
Astrology teaches that all human beings are subject to universal needs 
and desires — and that every individual is entirely and splendidly unique.
About This Book
Astrology has many forms. In this book, I focus on natal astrology, the inter-
pretation of a birth chart to gain insight into yourself and others. Using real
life examples, I show you how to construct your birth chart (or how to get it
on the Internet), how to interpret its component parts, and how to use that
information to gain insight into yourself and others.
I consider astrology a tool — an objective tool — for understanding self,
assessing relationships, examining your potential, and even making some
basic decisions. In this book, I show you how to use that tool.
Conventions Used in This Book
One of the most charming aspects of astrology, in my opinion, is that virtually
all birth charts, calendars, and books on the subject are strewn with tiny,
mysterious-looking symbols. Until you know those symbols by heart, their
presence can be distracting and confusing. That’s why I usually spell out the
names of the signs, planets, and aspects. With actual birth charts, however,
words are insufficient. I present those horoscopes just the way a professional
astrologer would — covered with symbols.

Memorizing those symbols is incredibly useful. But you don’t have to do it.
Instead, you can turn to the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book, where
you can find a neat list of every symbol you need to know. The Cheat Sheet
enables you to translate the symbols back into English. That way, when
you’re looking at a birth chart and you see something like this:
26
23
you’ll know that it means that the Moon ( ) is in Gemini (
) at 26 degrees 23
minutes.
In this book, whenever I refer to a planetary position such as the one in the
preceding example, I describe it as 26°23' Gemini. I usually don’t spell out the
words degree (°) and minute ('). I assume that you know them. On birth
charts, I go further and omit those two tiny symbols. Instead, the charts in
this book announce planetary positions by using boldface type for the
degrees and regular type for the minutes, as follows: 26 23.
What You’re Not to Read
I’d like you to read every word in this book, but you don’t have to. You can
safely ignore the paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon, and you
can even skip the sidebars (the gray-shaded boxes that are scattered
throughout the book). Although reading these sections will enhance your
understanding, you’ll get along fine without them.
Foolish Assumptions
Despite the title of this book, I assume that you’re no fool. I assume that
you’re intrigued by the art of astrology because you’re seeking fresh ways of
understanding. I also assume that, whether you’re a newcomer or a longtime
follower, you’re primarily interested in your own horoscope.
I assume that you have access to a computer and can get on the Web, where
you can easily obtain your birth chart. (You can also cobble one together
yourself, using only the material in this book.) That horoscope combined
with this book enables you to explore astrology in a multitude of ways.
My final assumption about you is simply that you have some sense; that you
expect insight from astrology, not winning lottery numbers; that you under-
stand that astrology isn’t about fate or even about luck. It’s about possibility,
propensity, and potential. An old maxim, taught to every generation of
astrologers, says it all: The stars impel, they do not compel.

Astrology For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

How This Book Is Organized
Astrology For Dummies, 2nd Edition, follows a logical sequence. It starts with
an overview, offers various methods for getting your chart, and then explores
the Sun signs and the other components of the chart in detail. After that, it
expands into relationships, leaps into ways of using astrology on a daily
basis, and concludes with a section on talents and timing.
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos
These three chapters cover the basics. Chapter 1 briefly discusses the Sun,
the Moon, the planets, the rising sign, and the 12 houses. Chapter 2 tells you
how to get your chart via the Internet or computer software. And Chapter 3
tells you how to construct a rough copy of your chart using the tables in this
book. After that, you’re ready to dive into the rest of the book.
Part II: Here Comes the Sun
Astrology is an interpretative art that can lead in many directions. It starts
here with four chapters about the Sun signs organized according to element.
Chapter 4 surveys the fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius); Chapter 5
explores the earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn); Chapter 6 talks
about the air signs (Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius); and Chapter 7 considers
the water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces).
Part III: Everything Else
in the Cosmic Cookbook
Sun Sign astrology, albeit fascinating, leaves many questions unanswered.
The chapters in this part help fill in those blanks. Chapter 8 illuminates the
Moon and the Nodes of the Moon in all 12 signs. Chapters 9 and 10 discuss
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto — plus the
asteroid Chiron, which was discovered in 1977 and is now routinely included
in horoscopes by many astrologers. Chapter 11 talks about the Ascendant,
and Chapter 12 describes the influence of the planets in each of the houses.
Finally, Chapter 13 looks at the way the planets interact by analyzing the
aspects, or geometrical relationships, that link them together.
After you’ve looked up your planetary placements, you may find yourself suf-
fering from information overload. Never fear — Chapter 14 shows you how to
winnow that data down to its most essential components by looking for pat-
terns that characterize your chart as a whole.

Introduction

Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now
Gaining insight into your psyche is a worthy enterprise, but most people
interested in astrology have other topics on their minds: like relationships,
which I discuss in Chapter 15. Included in that chapter is an assessment of all
78 Sun sign combinations — plus tips on how to capture the heart of each
sign of the zodiac.
In Chapters 16, 17, and 18, I tell you how to squeeze the maximum benefit out
of astrology. Chapter 16 explains how the current positions of Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto affect you — and what you can look for-
ward to in the future.
Chapter 17, the most hands-on chapter in the book, focuses on only one
planet (and I’m using that word loosely): the Moon. Its monthly swing
through all of its phases and all 12 signs brings days when the cosmos is with
you — and days when it’s decidedly not. In this chapter, I tell you how the
position of the Moon can help you decide when to take the initiative, when to
hang back, when to start projects, when to wait, and more.
Chapter 18 addresses a phenomenon that never fails to annoy people: retro-
grade Mercury, which is famous for generating bouts of delay and aggrava-
tion. I’m generally quite sanguine about this passing influence. After all, it
happens three times a year. What’s the big deal? Or so I used to think.
Recently, though, retrograde Mercury put me on the wrong train twice in a
week, swallowed up a crucial e-mail, and lobotomized my iPod. In this chap-
ter, I tell you how to cope better than I did.
Part V: The Part of Tens
After you understand the Sun, the Moon, and the planets, you have the basics
down. In this part, I apply that information in two ways. In Chapter 19, I
reveal the planetary components of ten different talents. And in Chapter 20,
which addresses the fine art of astrological timing, I tell you when to throw a
party, when to launch a business, when to buy a computer, even when to get
married — by the stars.
You’ll also find the Appendix, which lists the positions of the Sun, the Moon,
and the planets, including Chiron. This is the section of the book to turn to
when doing a birth chart. It tells you where the planets were (and will be)
between 1930 and 2012.

Icons Used in This Book
Four icons sprinkled throughout this book serve as road signs. Here’s what
the icons mean:
In an ideal world, every planetary placement, aspect, and transit discussed in
this book would be accompanied by an example from the life of a flesh-and-
blood human being. In the real world, book space is limited, so I’m able to
use only a few such examples. This icon highlights those examples. In many
cases, real-life examples feature movie stars, politicians, and other public fig-
ures. Occasionally, I focus on people I know personally. In those instances,
the names are changed. The astrology remains the same.
Certain facts and principles are essential. I discuss most of them in the early
chapters. But when you need to recall a fact in order to understand another
aspect of a birth chart, I try to remind you, gently, using this icon.
It’s impossible to talk about astrology without coming smack up against
astronomy and mathematics. Whenever I give a nuts-and-bolts scientific
explanation of an astrological phenomenon, I warn you upfront with this icon.
Want to skip the explanation? Go ahead. Most of the time, you can ignore it
and still be on track.
A paragraph marked with this icon may suggest an easier way of doing some-
thing. It may point you to a book or a Web site that covers material similar to
that being discussed in the text, it may suggest a way to offset a problem that
arises with a particular configuration in a chart, or it may tell you how to, say,
seduce a Capricorn. Never let it be said that astrology isn’t useful.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a novice, you may as well know the truth: Astrology is a complicated
system. The only way to describe it is to begin at the beginning, which is
what I do. But I’ve seen the way people leaf through astrology books, and I
have written it with the understanding that you may open it anywhere.
So consider this book a reference. You don’t need to read the chapters in any
particular order. You don’t even have to remember much from one chapter to
the next because this book is filled with cross-references and reminders. If
you know a little bit about the subject, you can jump in anywhere.
5
Introduction

Nonetheless, you may want to start at the beginning and read a chapter or
two before you plunge into the rest of book. If you know your sign but noth-
ing else, turn to Chapter 2, which tells you how to get an accurate horoscope.
If you already have a copy of that essential document, you’re ready to begin.
I invite you to take a random walk through the book.
I find the knowledge I’ve gained from astrology to be consistently fascinating
and helpful. It’s my hope that you, too, will rejoice in — and benefit from —
the wisdom of the stars.

L
egend has it that Sir Isaac Newton, widely considered the greatest genius
of all time, may have explored astrology. Newton had a complex, curious
mind. In addition to inventing calculus and discovering the universal law of
gravity, he was interested in alchemy (the quest to turn ordinary metals into
gold), the Bible, and astrology. When his friend Edmund Halley (after whom
the comet is named) made a disparaging remark about it, Newton, a conserv-
ative Capricorn, shot right back, “Sir, I have studied the subject. You have
not.” Or so the story goes.
Like every other astrologer, I like to think that story might be true. After all,
astrology has faded in and out of fashion, but it has never lacked followers.
Catherine de Medici had Nostradamus as her astrologer, Queen Elizabeth I
consulted John Dee, and other astrologers advised Napoleon, George
Washington, J. P. Morgan, and Ronald Reagan. Yet in all that time, no one has
provided a satisfying explanation as to why astrology works. Over the cen-
turies, proponents of the ancient art have suggested that gravity must be the
motor of astrology . . . or electromagnetism . . . or the metaphysical “law of
correspondences.” Carl G. Jung summarized that view when he wrote, “We
are born at a given moment, in a given place, and like vintage years of wine,
we have the qualities of the year and of the season in which we are born.”

I don’t know why astrology works, any more than Sir Isaac did. But I can
assure you that it does work. The pattern that the planets made at the
moment of your birth — that is, your birth chart or horoscope — describes
your tendencies, abilities, challenges, and potential. It doesn’t predict your
fate, though it does make some fates more easily achievable than others. The
exact shape of your destiny, I believe, is up to you.
In this chapter, I delve into the astronomy behind astrology, the signs of the
zodiac, and the components of the birth chart.
Looking at the Starry Sky
Picture, if you will, our solar system. In the middle is the Sun. Spinning
around it are the planets and asteroids, whose orbits surround the Sun
roughly the way the grooves on a record album encircle the label in the
center.
That idea, drilled into us in childhood, would have astonished ancient
stargazers. They never doubted that the Sun, Moon, and planets revolved
around the Earth. And although we know better, thinking so didn’t make them
stupid. The Sun really does look as if it revolves around the Earth. It seems to
rise in the east and set in the west. And it always stays within the confines of
a ribbon of space that encircles the Earth like a giant hoop. That strip of sky
is called the ecliptic.
Following are the three most important facts about the ecliptic:
 The ecliptic represents the apparent path of the Sun around the Earth —
apparent because, in fact, the Sun doesn’t spin around the Earth at all. It
just looks that way.
 Like a circle, the ecliptic is divided into 360 degrees — and each degree
is, in turn, divided into 60 minutes. The first 30 degrees of the ecliptic
are Aries, the next 30 degrees are Taurus, and so on.
 The stars that are scattered like dust along the entire length of the 
ecliptic form the constellations of the zodiac.
Here comes the confusing part: The signs of the zodiac and the constellations
that share their names aren’t the same. The signs are divisions of the ecliptic,
each exactly one-twelfth of the total length — 30 degrees. The constellations
have nothing to do with the signs. I explain this sorry state of affairs in the
sidebar “The signs, the constellations, and the precession of the equinoxes.”
10
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

Identifying the Signs of the Zodiac
The sign that the Sun occupied at the moment of your birth is the most basic
astrological fact about you. It defines your ego, motivations, needs, and
approach to life. But the Sun isn’t the only planet that affects you. (For astro-
logical purposes, both luminaries — the Sun and the Moon — are called 
planets. Do yourself a favor and don’t use this terminology when talking to
astronomers.) Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Chiron, Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto, not to mention the Moon, represent distinct types of
energy that express themselves in the style of the sign they’re in.
11
Chapter 1: An Astrological Overview: The Horoscope in Brief
The signs, the constellations, and the precession
of the equinoxes
Thousands of years ago, when the Babylonians
were establishing the principles of astrology,
the constellations and the signs of the zodiac
were in alignment. On the vernal equinox (the
first day of spring), the Sun was “in” the con-
stellation Aries: That is, if you could see the Sun
and the stars simultaneously, you’d see the Sun
surrounded by the stars of the Ram. In those
happy days, the signs and the constellations
coincided.
Alas, this is no longer the case. On the vernal
equinox today, the Sun shows up amidst the
(dim) stars of Pisces the Fish — a very different
kettle indeed.
The reason for this shift is that the Earth wob-
bles on its axis, which traces a circle in space
like the spindle of a spinning top. As the axis
shifts, the constellations seem to slip back-
wards. The amount of slippage over a human
lifetime is minuscule, but over generations it
adds up. As a result, every equinox takes place
a little earlier in the zodiac than the one before.
This process is called the precession of the
equinoxes. It explains why the vernal equinox,
which used to occur in the constellation Aries,
now takes place in Pisces.
When the equinox moves back even further, to
the constellation of the Water Bearer, the Age
of Aquarius will officially begin. Astrologers
differ about when that will be. Some are con-
vinced that it’s happening now. Others believe
that it’s decades — or centuries — away.
Eventually, the cycle will begin again. Around
the year 23800, the vernal equinox will return to
Aries, and astrologers will be able to skip this
entire explanation. Meanwhile, constellations of
the zodiac and the signs of the zodiac aren’t the
same.
Skeptics who attack astrology — and for some
reason, these wary souls can be amazingly 
hostile — often point to the changing position
of the constellations and the precession of the
equinoxes as proof that astrology is bogus. The
truth is that astrologers are well aware of this
phenomenon. They consider the constellations
as signposts and little more. What matters is the
division of the ecliptic. The stars, glorious
though they are, have nothing to do with your
sign.

Nevertheless, astrologically speaking, your Sun sign is the most essential fact
about you. To determine your sign, use Table 1-1. Keep in mind that the dates
vary from year to year. After all, although a circle has 360 degrees, and each
sign has precisely 30 degrees, it’s an inconvenient fact that a year has 365
days — not counting leap years. As a result, the signs don’t divide into the
days as neatly as you would want. If you were born on the first or final day of
a sign, you may want to check your birth sign by using the tables in the
Appendix, venturing onto the Internet, or consulting an astrologer.

Understanding the Signs
Like any truly satisfying system, astrology classifies and interprets its basic
building blocks in a number of ways. Just for starters, each sign is defined by
a polarity (positive or negative reaction pattern), a quality or modality (form
of expression), and an element (describing basic temperament).
12
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

Polarity: Dividing the zodiac by two
You can figure out the polarity of each sign by dividing the zodiac in half.
Beginning with Aries, six positive or masculine signs alternate with six 
negative or feminine signs. The sexist language, I regret to say, is traditional.
Many astrologers use the terms yin and yang instead. Call them what you
will, the meanings are as follows:
 Positive (yang) signs are more extroverted, objective, and assertive.
 Negative (yin) signs are more introverted, subjective, and receptive.
The zodiac can also be divided into pairs of opposing signs. The opposite
signs are: Aries and Libra; Taurus and Scorpio; Gemini and Sagittarius;
Cancer and Capricorn; Leo and Aquarius; and Virgo and Pisces.
Modality: Dividing the zodiac by three
The three modalities describe different forms of expression, as follows:
 Cardinal signs are enterprising. They initiate change and make things
happen. The cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn.
 Fixed signs consolidate and preserve change. They’re focused and
determined. The fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius.
 Mutable signs are flexible and versatile. They adapt and adjust. The
mutable signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces.
Within the cycle of the zodiac, the three modalities occur in sequence.
Cardinal energy initiates change, fixed energy digs its heels in and maintains
the status quo, and mutable energy adapts to shifting circumstances.
Elements: Dividing the zodiac by four
Describing the temperament of each sign of the zodiac by assigning it to one
of the four ancient elements is probably the most famous method of classifi-
cation. The four elements are fire, earth, air, and water:
 Fire brings vitality, excitement, and intensity. The fire signs are Aries,
Leo, and Sagittarius.
 Earth gives stability, common sense, and the ability to get things done.
The earth signs are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.
13
Chapter 1: An Astrological Overview: The Horoscope in Brief

 Air enlivens the intellect and enhances sociability. The air signs are
Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.
 Water strengthens the emotions and the intuition. The water signs are
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.
Putting the zodiac back together
Once you know the order of the signs, it’s easy to assign them to their correct
polarity, modality, and element because those classifications always occur in
sequence. (You can clearly see that sequence in Table 1-2.) Those classifica-
tions convey a great deal of information. If all you know is the polarity, modal-
ity, and element of each sign, you know a lot.

For example, take Cancer the Crab. It’s the sign of negative cardinal water.

Chapter 1: An Astrological Overview: The Horoscope in Brief
The Zodiac Man
The zodiac arcs across the cosmos, huge and
impossibly remote. Its symbolic equivalent,
small and incredibly close, is the human body.
Two thousand years ago, a Roman astrologer
named Manilius correlated each sign of the
zodiac to a part of the body in a sequence that
starts at the head with Aries and runs down to
the feet, which belong to Pisces. Medieval art,
both European and Islamic, includes many fine
renderings of the so-called Zodiac Man, which
also appears in ancient medical texts. Indeed,
medicine as it was once practiced relied on
astrology not only for its understanding of dis-
ease but also for its cure.
I have my doubts about medical astrology
(though I have to say, I have seen cases in
which it’s weirdly, even disturbingly, accurate).
However, I love this diagram because it reminds
me that the spectrum of experience repre-
sented by the signs of the zodiac is universal
and lives in everyone.
Or consider Leo, which lives next door to Cancer but boasts a very different
personality (as is always the case with adjacent signs). Leo is the sign of posi-
tive fixed fire. This means that its natives tend to be outgoing (positive),
determined (fixed), and full of flash (fire).

The polarity, modality, and element provide a rudimentary sense of what
each sign is about. For a detailed description of the signs, turn to Part II.
Considering the Sun, the Moon, 
and the Planets
The Sun, the Moon, and the planets play individual parts in your horoscope.
Their meanings are as follows:
 The Sun represents your essential self, will, individuality, vitality, and
desire for power. More than any other planet, it represents who you are.
It also symbolizes men in general.
 The Moon represents your emotions, subconscious, instincts, habits,
and memory. It also represents women in general.
 Mercury symbolizes your style of communication, your reasoning 
ability, and the way you think.
 Venus represents those parts of your life that are concerned with love,
attraction, beauty, possessions, and the arts.
 Mars is the planet of desire and aggression. It represents your physical
energy, combativeness, enterprise, and courage.
 Jupiter is the planet of expansion and good fortune. It represents
growth, prosperity, abundance, wisdom, generosity, and the higher
mind. Jupiter’s position in a horoscope tells you where you’re lucky.
 Saturn represents limitation, restriction, caution, organization,
endurance, and discipline. It tells you where you have to face your 
fears — and also where you’re ambitious.
 Chiron, a dwarf planet discovered in 1977, represents past hurt and
future healing. Astrologers, not all of whom use Chiron, often associate it
with holistic medicine.
 Uranus represents originality, independence, rebelliousness, inventive-
ness, insight, and everything unexpected.
 Neptune represents spirituality, dreams, psychic ability, intuition, 
disintegration, compassion, self-sacrifice, deception, and illusion.
 Pluto represents elimination, destruction, regeneration, renewal, and
transformation.

One way to simplify all this is to assign a single word — or, as astrologers
prefer to say, keyword — to each planet. These keywords, which summarize
each planet’s meaning, appear in Table 1-3.

Who Rules? Discovering 
the Rulers of the Signs
In an ideal world, each planet would work well in each sign. But in fact, some
placements are better than others. The sign in which a planet seems to func-
tion most effectively is the sign that it is said to rule. Two thousand years
ago, when astrologers only had to worry about the Sun, the Moon, and five
planets, they assigned the rulerships this way:
 The Sun ruled Leo.
 The Moon ruled Cancer.
17
Chapter 1: An Astrological Overview: The Horoscope in Brief

 Mercury ruled Gemini and Virgo.
 Venus ruled Taurus and Libra.
 Mars ruled Aries and Scorpio.
 Jupiter ruled Pisces and Sagittarius.
 Saturn ruled Aquarius and Capricorn.
After Uranus was discovered in 1781, followed by Neptune in 1846 and Pluto
in 1930, astrologers modified the system. Today, the most commonly
accepted planetary rulers are as follows:
 The Sun rules Leo.
 The Moon rules Cancer.
 Mercury rules Gemini and Virgo.
 Venus rules Taurus and Libra.
 Mars rules Aries.
 Jupiter rules Sagittarius.
 Saturn rules Capricorn.
 Uranus rules Aquarius.
 Neptune rules Pisces.
 Pluto rules Scorpio.
In recent years, astronomers have discovered legions of asteroids, moons,
and other celestial bodies in our solar system. One of them is Chiron,which
was discovered in 1977. Some astrologers believe that Chiron is the ruler of
Virgo. Others associate it with Sagittarius. Many don’t bother with it at all,
and it has yet to be assigned the rulership of a sign.
Assessing the Ascendant and the Houses
The planets aren’t the only essential components of your chart. The
Ascendant or rising sign — the sign that was climbing over the eastern 
horizon at the moment of your birth — is equally important. It refers to 
your mask or persona — the face that you show the world. It also marks 
the start of the 12 houses.
18
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

The Ascendant
Have you ever had a friend who was Miss Congeniality — until you got to
know her? Did you ever encounter anyone who seemed standoffish and cold
at first but warmed up later on? Do you know anyone whose devil-may-care,
lighthearted attitude masks a calculating, manipulative mind? And have you
ever wondered how you strike other people, especially when they don’t 
know you well? Your horoscope provides the answer. While your Sun sign
may not be apparent to people, they definitely notice your Ascendant. It’s
your image, your facade, your surface personality. Whether it clashes or 
harmonizes with your Sun sign, it describes the way people see you and the
impression that you make. Indeed, some astrologers consider the ruler of the
Ascendant — that is, the planet that rules the rising sign — to be the overall
ruler of your chart.
No matter what your Sun sign might be, any one of the 12 signs might have
been on the eastern horizon when you were born. If you were born around
dawn, when the Sun was peeking over the horizon, you already know your
rising sign: It’s the same as your Sun sign. If you were born at any other time
of day, your rising sign and Sun sign differ.
For those people whose Sun signs and rising signs are identical, the surface
and the substance are the same. For everyone else, what you see isn’t neces-
sarily what you get.
Consider Whoopi Goldberg: She has Aquarius rising, so she appears progres-
sive, sociable, and eccentric — a personality with a lively mind and a
detached, observant approach to life. In fact, her Sun is in Scorpio, so
beneath her brilliant Aquarian surface, she’s intensely emotional, passionate,
and secretive — not detached at all.
To determine your rising sign, you need to know the time of your birth. When
you have that, turn to Chapter 3, which gives you a rough estimate of your
rising sign. Then go to Chapter 11 for an interpretation.
Besides shaping your personality, the Ascendant serves another function: It
opens the door to the houses. For more about that subject, read on.

Chapter 1: An Astrological Overview: The Horoscope in Brief

Taking the house tour
It makes no difference whether you’re a fun-loving Leo or a workaholic
Capricorn, you still have to deal with relationships, money, health, career,
and so on. Those areas come under the authority of the houses, which divide
the sky into 12 parts, beginning with the Ascendant, which marks the start of
the first house. The meanings of the houses are summarized in Table 1-4.

Just as every birth chart includes all the planets, every horoscope has all 12
houses. The sign on the cusp, or beginning of the house, describes your
approach to it. For instance, if the sign of the bull is on the cusp of your
house of work, your attitude toward your job is Taurean, making you depend-
able, productive, and a bit of a plodder, regardless of whether that house is
crammed full of planets or empty.
The word cusp is used in two ways in astrology. When people say they were
born “on the cusp,” they mean that their birthday falls at the end of one sign
and the beginning of another. They usually think that they have qualities
belonging to both signs. (I discuss this issue in Chapter 3.) When astrologers
refer to the cusp of a house, they mean the house’s starting point.

W
hat could be more fabulously arcane than an astrological chart? Well,
lots of things: Alchemical sigils, kabalistic diagrams, magic spells —
you name it. But this book isn’t about them. It’s about astrology, which only
seems strange. That’s because an astrological chart, with all its mysterious-
looking symbols, has nothing mystical about it. It’s a representation of the
real world, and it isn’t peculiar at all. An astrological chart is a picture, in
streamlined form, of the solar system at the time of your birth. It’s that
simple.
To visualize the cosmos as it was then, imagine standing on the Earth at the
precise moment of your birth. Imagine, too, that you’re facing south and look-
ing at a gigantic clock face that has been superimposed on the sky. To your
left, in the nine o’clock position, is the eastern horizon. That’s your
Ascendant. If you were born around dawn, that’s also where your Sun is. The
twelve o’clock position is high in the sky in front of you. That’s where your
Sun is if you were a lunchtime delivery. To your right, in the three o’clock
position, is the western horizon. If you were born around dusk, your Sun is
there. And if you snuck into this world around midnight, when the Sun was
illuminating the other side of the planet, your Sun is in the six o’clock spot.
If you know the phase of the Moon at your birth, you can locate it in a similar
way. Were you born under a new moon? Then your Moon and Sun are in
roughly the same place. Born under a full moon? Then the Sun and Moon are
opposite each other — 180° apart. If one is rising, the other is setting.

The point is this: The horoscope is neither a metaphysical construct nor a
mystical symbol nor a psychological portrait. It’s a map. Your horoscope
shows the position of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the moment of your
birth. The astrologer’s task is to look at that map and figure out its meaning.
But first you have to get your hands on the map. In this chapter, I tell you
how to do just that.
Gathering the Information You Need
If you’re like most people, you won’t have any trouble finding your birth
information. Here’s what you need:
 Your month, day, and year of birth
 The place of your birth
 Your exact birth time — or as close to it as you can get
Without an accurate birth time, you can never know what your Ascendant is
(see Chapter 11 for more about Ascendants). You won’t have trustworthy
house placements for your planets. You may not even know your Moon sign
because it changes signs every two or three days. Without an accurate birth
time, interpreting your chart correctly will be challenging. And predicting the
future will be close to impossible.
Fortunately, finding the exact time is usually easy. But don’t be surprised if
your mother’s memory of what must surely have been the highlight of her
entire life turns out to be spotty. Since I haven’t done a survey, I have no sta-
tistics to bandy about, but I will say this: It’s shocking how many parents
can’t remember when their children were born. They don’t know if it was 2:05
or 5:02. One mother even confessed to me that she wasn’t sure who was born
at 10:06 a.m.: her daughter or herself. That’s why I recommend that you cor-
roborate your birth time through the official record — your birth certificate.
To get your birth certificate online, check out the National Center for Health
Statistics at www.cdc.gov/nchs and click on the link that says “Help obtain-
ing birth, death, marriage, or divorce certificates.”
Dealing with approximate birth times
What if no one thought to look at a clock when you were born? First, keep in
mind that an approximate time is better than nothing — much better. If all
you know is that you came into this world before breakfast or during the Late
Show with David Letterman, that’s useful information, even if it’s not exact.
22
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

If you aren’t sure of your birth time, you might consider asking a professional
astrologer to rectify your chart. Rectification is a complex process. It involves
working backwards from major events in your life (such as marriage, divorce,
or the death of a parent) to make an educated guess about your probable
birth time. Some astrology software includes rectification modules. Even so,
it’s wise to proceed with caution: Unless the astrologer has considerable
experience, rectification isn’t a sure bet.
Coping with an absence of information
A more significant problem arises when you have no idea what time you were
born. I have a beloved friend, one of many children, who never knew her
birth time. And then one day, things got rapidly worse. During an astonishing
conversation with an older sister, she discovered that no one in her family
could vouch with 100 percent certainty for the day of her birth — or even the
month. Suddenly she wasn’t sure whether she was a Libra (no way) or a
Scorpio (yes). This rare situation is an astrologer’s worst-case scenario.
More typically, people know the day, month, and year of their birth — but not
the time. That’s not a tragedy. Even without the time, you can uncover a
wealth of information about yourself. However, when you go online to get
your horoscope — or even when you do it yourself — you have to adjust for
the missing information.
In the absence of anything resembling an accurate birth time, I recommend
that you do what professional astrologers do: Pretend that you were born
either at noon or at dawn (my preference) and proceed accordingly. (In
Chapter 3, I tell you more about what to do if your birth time is lost in space.)
What It Takes to Cast Your Chart 
the Old-Fashioned Way
In the past, before the computer infiltrated every corner of human existence,
figuring out the positions of the planets was a challenge. It required patience,
hours of free time, a fearless approach to mathematics, and an eagerness to
grapple with the kinds of boring details that drive most people nuts.
For instance, you had to look up the longitude and latitude of your birth place,
and you had to correct for its distance from the standard time meridian for
that location. You had to distinguish between local time and Greenwich mean
time, not to mention standard time, daylight saving time, and war time. Then
you had to calculate the movement of the planets using, among other tools, a
table of proportional logarithms. Most people didn’t want to bother.

Chapter 2: Getting Your Precise Horoscope: The Old Way versus the Easy Way

I always felt differently. I liked staying up late surrounded by numerical tables,
volumes of astrological data, pads of yellow paper, and the special horoscope
blanks I bought at a metaphysical bookstore. As I calculated each planetary
position and house cusp, drew the symbols of the signs and planets onto the
chart, and counted up how many planets were in fire signs, in earth signs, and
so on, the chart — and the person —slowly grew clear in my mind.
That process takes time, and I don’t do it anymore. Instead, I use a computer,
like every other astrologer I know. With a computer, you can get an accurate
chart without even thinking about math. Later in this chapter, I tell you how.
Still, the best way to understand astrology is to cast a chart the old-fashioned
way. Here’s what you would need to calculate it yourself:
 The precise longitude and latitude of your birthplace. You can figure it
out from a map or look it up in a book like The American Atlas: U.S.
Longitudes and Latitudes, Time Changes and Time Zones, by Thomas G.
Shanks (ACS Publications), which includes an international atlas.
 The details about your time of birth. Just because you know the exact
moment of your birth doesn’t mean that your problems with time are
over. You also have to know what time zone you were born in — and this
is an area riddled with quicksand.
For instance, Tennessee is divided down the middle, half in one time
zone and half in another. Most places in Texas observe central standard
time — but El Paso doesn’t. And if you were born in Indiana between
1955 and 1965, you’re in deep trouble. During those years, the powers-
that-be, unable to choose between central and eastern time, decided to
carve up the state and assign different regions to each time zone. Each
year, they did it in a different way. If you were caught in this civic
calamity, you have no choice: Go to a professional astrologer. Or log on
to one of the Web sites listed later in this chapter.
Then there’s daylight saving time. Until 2007, it ran from late April to late
October, but the exact days differ from year to year and from state to
state. For example, if you were born in California on October 27, 1963,
you were born under daylight saving time. But if your birthday is a year
later, on October 27, 1964, you were born under standard time.
And did you know that during World War II, the entire U.S. operated
under war time? It began on February 9, 1942, about two months after
Pearl Harbor, and ended on September 30, 1945. (It was also in operation
in some places during World War I.)
To account for these variations in time, you need a trustworthy source.
Again, I recommend The American Atlas: U.S. Longitudes and Latitudes,
Time Changes and Time Zones, compiled by Thomas G. Shanks.
 A table of houses. This book-size table tells you what degree of the
zodiac is rising at any given moment according to the time and latitude
of your birth. It also tells the degrees that appear on the other house
24
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

cusps. One resource for this information is the Michelsen Book of Tables
by Neil F. Michelsen (ACS Publications), which includes two popular
types of house division as well as a worksheet for casting a horoscope
the old-fashioned way.
 An ephemeris for the year you were born. The Rosetta Stone of astrol-
ogy, an ephemeris is an almanac that lists the positions of the Sun, Moon,
and planets for every day of the year, either for midnight or noon in
Greenwich, England (the basis for Greenwich mean time, from which all
time zones are determined). So if you were born on the stroke of mid-
night in Greenwich, you don’t have to do a thing to determine the posi-
tion of your planets. You can read them right out of the book.
If you were born at any other time or place, you have to make adjust-
ments. Using an ephemeris, a table of houses, and the principles of high
school algebra, you can come up with a close approximation of your
chart. Should you insist on precision (perhaps because you have a dose
of Virgo in your birth chart), you need one more item, which I explain in
the following bullet.
 A table of proportional logarithms. Using this numerical chart makes
your calculations precise. But if going to the mat with a table of loga-
rithms sounds like a fight you won’t win, do yourself a favor: Skip the
calculations and go directly to the Internet.
To get your hands on any of these books, go to a well-stocked astrological or
New Age bookstore — if you can find one. Or check out The Astrology Center
of America at www.astroamerica.com. The folks who run this place have
virtually everything (including software), and they comment on much of it, so
you can do a little comparison shopping right there. Plus, if you’re intrigued
by Tarot cards, you’ll enjoy this site, which lets you peek into about a hun-
dred different decks. Contact The Astrology Center of America via the Web,
by phone at (410) 638-7761, or at 207 Victory Lane, Bel Air, MD 21014.
Getting Your Horoscope in a Nanosecond
The easiest way to get an accurate copy of your horoscope is to log on to the
Internet, go to one of the sites in the following list, and type in the date, year,
time, and place of your birth. Here are three of the best sites to visit:
 Astrolabe (www.alabe.com): Astrolabe offers an excellent, free birth
chart along with about three pages of interpretation. Feed your birth
date into their form, send it off, and seconds later, it comes back to you,
complete — and I mean complete. In contrast to other Web sites with
seemingly similar offers, Astrolabe supplies not only some basic inter-
pretation but also an image of the actual chart, with the Sun, Moon, and
planets placed clearly within the zodiac wheel. Astrolabe also offers
other services, for which you have to pay.
25
Chapter 2: Getting Your Precise Horoscope: The Old Way versus the Easy Way

 Astrodienst (www.astro.com): You can get a free birth chart (or “por-
trait”) at this absorbing Web site — and lots more, including lengthy
daily horoscopes, a report on “love, flirtation, and sex,” a relationship
chart and analysis, and a six-month forecast based on the changing posi-
tion — or transits (see Chapter 16) — of the planets. All these freebies
are abbreviated versions of longer reports you can buy. I don’t have a
problem with that. The only missing ingredient here is that your actual
chart — the round emblem that suggests a personal mandala — is not
shown. You have to construct it yourself. (I show you how in Chapter 3.)
 Chaos Astrology (www.chaosastrology.com): The free birth chart
offered at this Web site is longer than most — plus, it includes the actual
chart, if you know where to look. The trick is simple: After you feed in
your birth information and your astrological profile appears on the
screen, click on the sun/moon icon at the top of the page. Lo and
behold: Your actual birth chart appears.
Investing in DIY Software
Nothing in the astrological world is more fun than being able to cast accurate
charts for anyone at a moment’s notice. Astrological do-it-yourself software is
endlessly diverting. It enables you to calculate natal charts, compare charts,
determine how the planets may affect you in the future, and, in short, enter-
tain yourself for hours. Software isn’t cheap, but if you decide it’s worth the
expense, the following sections give you a few recommendations.
Maximizing the Mac
If you use a Macintosh (as I do, and I’m not backing down), you have only two
choices:
 Io Programs: Time Cycles Research Programs offers a wide selection of
software which includes the following:
• Io Edition, their core program, which does all manner of calcula-
tions but offers no analysis.
• Io Interpreter, which provides interpretations and creates written
reports. It’s available with a choice of modules, including Io
Horoscope, the basic interpretation program; Io Child, which
analyzes children; Io Relationship, which compares horoscopes;
Io Forecast, which tells you what the future may hold; and Io Body
and Soul, which suggests, among other things, what vitamins you
ought to take.
26
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

• Io Detective, which allows you to research all kinds of cosmic 
phenomenon in the charts of thousands of famous people.
• Io Midnight Ephemeris, which provides a full ephemeris page for
every month between January 1850 and December 2049.
Io programs cater to professionals. I’ve been using them for years, but
they’re expensive (about $200 each) and complicated. Reach the people
at Time Cycles by phone at (800) 827-2240 or (860) 444-6641, by e-mail at
astrology@timecycles.com, or on the Web at www.timecycles.com.
 TimePassages: Astrograph Software designed this software as a univer-
sal starting point, appropriate for both beginners and professionals, and
Mac advocates and PC fanatics. The top-of-the-line program, with a
myriad of astrological functions you can play with, costs about the same
as a single Io program, while the basic edition, which provides natal
charts, compatibility charts, and two ways of forecasting the future,
runs about $50. The savings are considerable.
This program is a lot of fun as well as an effective way to master the
topic. Click on any element of a chart — a planet, a house cusp, an 
asteroid — and an explanation pops up. If you’re a newcomer to 
astrology, this product could be just what you’re looking for. Call (866)
77-ASTRO or go to www.astrograph.com, where you can download a
free demo with over 200 celebrity charts, including Angelina Jolie, Brad
Pitt, and J. K. Rowling. (To get the demo, click on any one of the software
choices and then go to “Downloads.”) Even if you don’t spring for the
software, you can get a free copy of your chart along with a mini-interpre-
tation of the Sun and Moon placements. (Just click on Horoscopes and go
to the bottom of the page, where you can create an account for free.)
Playing with the PC
I love the Mac. I think Steve Jobs is a genius. But I’ve started to wonder why
there’s so much great astrological software for the PC and hardly any for the
Mac. I also wonder what it would be like if I, you know, fooled around on a PC.
Would it be wrong?
The software options for PC are beyond tempting and too numerous to do jus-
tice to here. I asked astrologer Hank Friedman, a software guru and frequent
software reviewer for The Mountain Astrologer magazine, to make a few sugges-
tions. His recommendations include — but were not limited to — the following:
 The Electronic Astrologer Series by ACS (www.astrocom.com). ACS
produces three basic programs that can be purchased separately or
bundled together at a savings: “The Electronic Astrologer Reveals Your
Horoscope,” “The Electronic Astrologer Reveals Your Future,” and “The
Electronic Astrologer Reveals Your Romance.”
27
Chapter 2: Getting Your Precise Horoscope: The Old Way versus the Easy Way

These programs include plenty of helpful information, but primarily they
simply generate reports. To get an idea of what they’re like, go to the
Web site, click on the “Electronic Astrologer Series,” and then click on
the program that interests you. Free sample printouts appear at the
bottom of the page. The free natal and future reports are written for
Willie Nelson. The romance report is written for an imaginary couple:
Drew Barrymore and the debonair Cary Grant, 71 years her senior.
Except for the fact that he died in 1986, she could do worse (and has).
 Kepler 7.0. This amazingly comprehensive, exciting program includes 
47 lessons in astrology, an astrological encyclopedia, over 19,000 charts,
and a mind-boggling collection of functions. Want information on Vedic
astrology, fixed stars, or the dark moon Lilith? It’s all here, along with
the basics: natal charts, transits and progressions, and comparisons, for
about $300. Go to www.patterns.com for more information.
 AstrolDeluxe ReportWriter by Halloran Software; Win*Star Express;
Janus; and the list goes on and on. Which is why you might want to get
some additional help before making a purchase.
Seeking out advice
If you’ve decided to invest in astrological software, it’s smart to talk to some-
one who’s knowledgeable about both the software you want and the hard-
ware you have. Here are two ways to get trustworthy information:
 Visit the Astrology Software Shop (www.astrologysoftwareshop.
com) or e-mail the shop at info@astrologysoftwareshop.com.
 Contact Hank Friedman for assistance in choosing software that’s right
for you. The consultation is free, and he sells all the software at a real
discount. You can e-mail him at stars@soulhealing.com or give him
a call at (888) 777-7366.
Above all, visit his Web site at www.soulhealing.com. There you can
find detailed discussions of astrological software, fascinating articles on
many other aspects of astrology, and a stunning collection of recipes
involving chocolate — because man cannot live by stars alone.

oing your chart the old-fashioned way provides the best possible intro-
duction to the science behind the art of astrology. But it’s a time-con-
suming process. Plus, if you make a mistake — and believe me, it’s easy to
make a mistake — your efforts will be wasted. I know. When I first cast my
own chart, I looked the results up in a book and was astonished to learn that
I was the kind of extroverted person who rises to prominence in every group.
Since, in reality, I was so shy that I sat in the back of every classroom and
dreaded going to parties, I decided to try another book. This one opined that
I was thin and bony, with a firm sense of self-discipline. If only.
Either I was living someone else’s life or astrology was wrong. I decided to
recalculate. That’s when I discovered that I had subtracted when I should
have added. It was a small error on the page, but it made a substantial differ-
ence in the interpretation.
You don’t have to make a mistake like mine. By getting your chart on the
Internet or by using astrological software — two options I discuss in Chap-
ter 2 — you can be confident that the computations are accurate. And it 
only takes a moment.
But what if you’re outside the reach of a computer? What if you’re all alone
on that mythical desert island, leaning against that palm tree, reading this
book? Using only the information contained here, you can construct a rough
version of your horoscope (or anyone else’s) — and for most purposes, that
approximation will do just fine. First, copy the blank chart form on the Cheat
Sheet, either by machine or — if that desert island doesn’t happen to have a
Kinko’s — by hand. Next, follow the instructions in this chapter.

Using the Tables in This Book 
to Identify Your Planets
To figure out your planets, turn to the tables in the Appendix. For each
planet, flip to the year of your birth and jot down its position, beginning 
with the luminaries:
 The Sun: Its position is your Sun sign — your sign of the zodiac.
If you were born on a day when the Sun moved from one sign to the next
(that is, if you were born “on the cusp”), you need to take an extra step
to identify your Sun sign, but you can only do it if you know the time of
your birth. What you want to figure out is this: Which came first, your
birth or the passage of the Sun into the next sign?
For instance, consider the horoscope of rocker Bruce Springsteen, born
September 23, 1949. On that day, the Sun moved from analytical Virgo to
Libra, the sign of relationships. Which one is he? According to the table
at the back of this book, the Sun made its move that day at 4:06 a.m.
eastern standard time (EST). (All the tables in this book are EST.) Bruce
was born well after that, at 10:50 p.m. So he’s a Libra.
Making this calculation is more difficult if you were born in another time
zone — but only slightly. The introductory material to the Appendix tells
you how to account for time differences.
 The Moon: Figuring out the placement of the Moon, which represents
your emotions, can be challenging because the Moon swings into a new
sign of the zodiac every two or three days. Here too, the exact time of
your birth can make a difference.
For instance, director Oliver Stone was born on September 15, 1946. Turn
to the Moon Table in the Appendix. Since his birthday isn’t listed, check
out the closest preceding day. You can see that on September 14 the Moon
entered Taurus. It didn’t change signs until the 16th, when it entered
Gemini. On the 15th, the Moon was still in the sign of the Bull. (And does
Oliver Stone seem like a willful, emotional person who doesn’t let go easily
and cares about money more than you might think? Makes sense to me.)
Identifying the Moon sign is more difficult in a case like that of actress
Kate Hudson. She was born in Los Angeles on April 19, 1979, at 10:51 a.m.
Pacific standard time (PST). On that day, according to the Moon Table in
the Appendix, the Moon entered Aquarius at 15:02 (that is, 3:02 p.m.)
eastern standard time. So is her Moon in Aquarius or is it in Capricorn?
To answer that, you need to figure out what time it was in California
when the Moon changed sign. Since it’s three hours earlier on the West
Coast, figuring out California time means subtracting three hours from
EST. When it’s 3:02 p.m. in the East (or 15:02, as the table says), it’s 12:02
in L.A. That’s when the Moon slipped into Aquarius. Since Kate was born
prior to that, at 10:51 a.m., her Moon is in Capricorn.
30
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

Of course, the Sun and the Moon aren’t the only celestial bodies that may
have changed signs on the day you were born. On December 10, 1982, for
example, Mercury, Mars, and the Moon all changed signs. If you were born on
that eventful day, you would have to calculate the positions of all three. Or —
as I suggest in Chapter 2 — you could skip the hard work and go directly to
the Internet. But you should know: Those of us who learned how to cast
horoscopes back when “Apple” was nothing more than a snack and a record
label consider that a cheat.
What if you were born on a day when the Moon (or any other planet)
changed sign but you don’t know the time of your birth? You have to guess.
Read the descriptions of both signs to see whether one of them rings true.
You may know immediately: One placement sounds just like you and the
other sounds like no one you’ve ever even met. But don’t be surprised if it’s
difficult to decide. First, every sign in the zodiac appears in your chart some-
where, so some part of you identifies with every sign. Beyond that, other
planets may blur the picture. For instance, the Moon may have moved from
Taurus to Gemini on the day you were born. But if you also have Jupiter in
Taurus and Venus in Gemini, you already have qualities associated with both
signs, and it may be hard to isolate the effect of the Moon based solely on
intuition. You need mathematics.
In most cases you can identify the signs occupied by the planets in your
chart simply by looking them up in the Appendix, no calculation required.
Just jot ’em down, using the following list:
 Mercury: The planet of communication has to be in one of three signs:
Your Sun sign, the sign that precedes your Sun sign, or the sign that fol-
lows it. If Mercury is anywhere else, you’re reading the tables wrong.
 Venus: The planet of love and beauty is always within 48° of your Sun. So
if your Sun is at 15° Gemini, your Venus could be as far away as 3° Leo 
or 12° Aries. Venus can never be farther than two signs away.
 The rest of the planets: They can be in any sign of the zodiac, regardless
of your Sun sign.
Figuring Out Your Ascendant 
or Rising Sign
Figuring out the sign that was rising over the eastern horizon at the moment
of your birth is the hardest part of casting a chart, but it’s essential because
the Ascendant or rising sign represents the part of you that other people see
(and sense) first.
31
Chapter 3: Estimating Your Horoscope Using the Tables in This Book

Although figuring out the Ascendant isn’t for the faint-hearted, there’s a logic
to it. At any given moment, one sign of the zodiac is rising in the east and its
opposite sign is setting in the west. If you were born at dawn, when the Sun
was on the horizon, your rising sign is the same as your Sun sign. If you have
the Sun in Aries, you’re Aries rising — a double Aries, as they say, and a for-
midable example of fire signs in action. If you were born at sunset, your rising
sign would be the opposite of your Sun sign: That is, if you’re an Aries born at
dusk, you have Libra rising — and Aries setting.
The ecliptic — the path followed by the Sun as it moves across the sky (see
Chapter 1) — surrounds the Earth like a gigantic ring. That ring is divided into
12 equal segments, one for each sign. As the Earth rotates on its axis, it spins
past each segment — all 12 signs in 24 hours, or approximately one sign every
two hours (although latitude makes a difference and some signs hang around
longer than others). The segment of the zodiac that happens to be coming up
over the horizon at the moment of your birth is your rising sign.
Finding your rising sign 
in three easy steps
Here’s how to figure out your rising sign the easy way:
1. Turn to Figure 3-1.
2. Locate your birth time in the boldface horizontal row at the top of the
table or in the boldface horizontal row in the middle of the table.
3. Find your Sun sign in the column on the left side of the table.
The point where the horizontal row and the vertical column intersect
shows your probable rising sign.
Don’t forget daylight saving time, which has usually been in operation in the
United States from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October. You
can account for it by subtracting one hour from your birth time.
As an example of how this table works, consider the actress Nicole Kidman, a
Gemini born June 20, 1967, at 3:15 p.m. in Honolulu, Hawaii (although, yes,
she grew up in Australia). Find her Sun sign (Gemini) in the column on the
left. Now run your finger across the Gemini row until you reach the column
labeled “2 p.m. – 4 p.m.” The sign that appears there — Scorpio — is her
rising sign or Ascendant. Precise calculations bear that out. (Note that
although Nicole was born between April and October, it isn’t necessary to
make an adjustment for daylight saving time because it isn’t observed in
Hawaii.)
32
Part I: Mapping Your Place in the Cosmos 

Does that Scorpio Ascendant make sense? To my mind, it describes perfectly
her intense, mysterious appeal. Think of To Die For, her break-out movie, in
which she plays an upbeat Gemini-like weather girl with a dark, seductive,
manipulative — dare I say Scorpionic? — bent. Despite her sunny beauty and
high-profile status as a fashion icon, there’s something enigmatic and opaque
about Nicole. Who is she, really? I mean, has anyone out there seen Dogville?
Figure 3-1:

33
Chapter 3: Estimating Your Horoscope Using the Tables in This Book

Beware of the limitations
Although this method for estimating the rising sign works for Nicole Kidman,
it’s by no means a perfect technique. Often, precise calculations don’t square
with the results of the table. One reason is that the Earth revolves around the
Sun at a tilt. As a result, some signs (like Gemini) take longer to rise over the
horizon than others (like Pisces). So the two-hour blocks I divided the day
into are artificially equal.
Geography also matters. Imagine two babies born in New England on January 1,
2001, at 11 a.m. The one born in Portland, Maine, has Aries rising, as pre-
dicted by the table. But the Earth is curved, and a few hundred miles away, in
Hartford, Connecticut, Aries has yet to climb over the horizon. The child
born there has Pisces rising. I hate to admit it, but the table will not reflect
that difference.
So when you use this table, know that it can’t be fully trusted. More than half
the time, it’s right on the money. The rest of the time, it’s wrong, generally by
one sign. If the sign given as your Ascendant doesn’t sound right to you, con-
template the signs on either side (with particular attention to the sign that
comes first). For example, if the table says you’re Gemini rising, but in real
life you’re the strong, silent type, consider the possibility that Gemini may
not be your Ascendant, and read Taurus instead.
Determining Your Houses
Once you have identified your rising sign, your troubles are over. If you haven’t
already done so, go to the Cheat Sheet and make a copy of the blank chart. 
(Or draw a circle and divide it into 12 pie-shaped pieces, representing the
houses.) Now all you have to do is label the houses with the appropriate signs.
Begin by labeling the first house with the name (or better yet, the symbol) of
your rising sign. Then move counterclockwise around the circle, labeling the
second house with the sign that follows your rising sign, the third house with
the sign that follows that, and so on. No matter what your rising sign is, the
signs always follow in their usual order: That is, they begin with Aries and
proceed to Pisces, going counterclockwise. (See the Cheat Sheet.) Thus, if
you have Aries rising, then Taurus is on the cusp of the second house, Gemini
on the cusp of the third, and so on to the twelfth house, where Pisces pre-
sides. And if you’re Scorpio rising, you have Sagittarius on the cusp of the
second house, Capricorn on the cusp of the third, and so on, right up to
Libra, which is the sign on the cusp of the twelfth house. In that case, the
wheel of your chart should look something like Figure 3-2.

Chapter 3: Estimating Your Horoscope Using the Tables in This Book
Dividing the houses
Astrologers have long debated the best way 
of slicing up a chart. The most common
approaches are the Koch system, a time-based
method introduced in 1962, and the Placidus
system, an equally complex technique named
after Placidus de Tito, a 17th-century astrologer
who got it from an Arabian astrologer of the 8th
century. Placidus is difficult to calculate and
grossly inaccurate in northern latitudes.
Nonetheless, because it’s widespread, it’s the
system I use for the charts in this book.
The simplest system — well, actually the
second simplest — was invented by Ptolemy
almost 2,000 years ago. It’s called the equal
house system because it assumes that all the
houses are the same size. In this system, if your
Ascendant is 12°26' Leo (like Johnny Depp’s),
you have 12°26' Virgo on the cusp of the second
house, 12°26' Libra on the cusp of the third, and
so on around the chart.
The most straightforward system of house divi-
sion comes from Hindu astrology. It aligns the
houses with the signs and puts 0 degrees on the
cusp of every house. (The Ascendant is, there-
fore, not the cusp of the first house but simply a
point within it.) So if you have Sagittarius rising,
all of Sagittarius is in your first house, all 
of Capricorn in your second house, and so on.
In this chapter, I recommend this method.
Although this system isn’t used extensively in
Western astrology, the astrologer Robert Hand
recommends its revival — and there’s much to
be said for it, especially when you suspect that
the birth time is incorrect. If that’s your situation,
I recommend this system. Put your Sun sign on
the cusp of the first house (at nine o’clock) and
continue from there.

The first house begins at nine o’clock and extends counterclockwise to eight
o’clock, the second house begins at eight o’clock and goes to seven o’clock,
and so on.
Creating a Horoscope
Putting together a basic birth chart involves these steps: Looking up the
planets, figuring out your Ascendant, making the wheel of the horoscope, and
placing the planets on the wheel. After that, you’re ready for the true art of
astrology: interpretation.
To illustrate the process, let’s go back to Nicole Kidman, who was born on
June 20, 1967, at 3:15 p.m. in Honolulu. To make her birth chart, begin by
looking up her planets in the Appendix. Here’s what we find for that day:
Her Sun is in Gemini.
Her Moon is in Sagittarius.
The North Node of the Moon is in Taurus (which means that the 
South Node is in Scorpio).
Mercury is in Cancer.
Venus is in Leo.
Mars is in Libra.
Jupiter is in Leo.
Saturn is in Aries.
Uranus is in Virgo.
Neptune is in Scorpio.
Pluto is in Virgo.
The next step is to figure out her rising sign, which we did earlier in the 
chapter. It’s Scorpio.
Now take a blank horoscope wheel like the one on the Cheat Sheet and assign
Scorpio to the first house, Sagittarius to the second, and so on, as shown in
Figure 3-2. Write the symbols for the planets (or their names) in the correct
houses. If you’re a beginner, you may want to do this in plain English, a
process that yields a chart that looks something like Figure 3-3.
Better yet, memorize the beautiful and mysterious astrological symbols. 
(The Cheat Sheet at the beginning of the book can help.) That way, you end
up with a chart that looks like Figure 3-4.

Chapter 3: Estimating Your Horoscope Using the Tables in This Book

Of course, the best possible chart is more specific. If you get your chart from
the Internet or generate it yourself using astrological software, you’ll get
something like Figure 3-5. This figure shows Nicole’s horoscope, adjusted 
for place (Honolulu) and calculated to the minute via computer, using the
Placidus system of house division (see the sidebar “Dividing the houses” 
for more on this system).
Are there differences between these methods? There are, though in Nicole’s
case, the differences aren’t dramatic. The main difference is that an exact
chart provides specific degrees for the planets, the Ascendant, and the house
cusps. That information is crucial, especially for timing predictions.
Nonetheless, an estimated chart is still stuffed with information about your
personality, your talents, your weaknesses, your desires, your love life, your
career, and even your future. It’s not perfect. But it’s thought-provoking and
absorbing, and a good place to start.

Part II
Here Comes 
the Sun

In this part . . .
W
hen I was in college, I picked up my first astrology
book virtually by accident, and my understanding
of life was transformed. The book — it was one of many
by Zolar, a name used by a succession of astrological 
writers — described the people I knew with uncanny
accuracy based solely on their sign, which is determined
by the position of the Sun. My parents, my roommate, my
so-called boyfriend — all were there, in stunning detail.
During those first few hours, I discovered that, all by itself,
the Sun sign is amazingly revealing.
Later, I realized that an astrological chart is as compli-
cated as a long-running soap opera (and in the hands of a
skilled astrologer, almost as predictable). A chart includes
the Sun, the Moon, eight planets, twelve houses, and
more. But the core of almost every horoscope is the Sun.
In this part, you can check out of the implications of your
Sun sign. Whether it’s a fire sign, an earth sign, an air sign,
or a water sign, your Sun sign reveals your intrinsic self
and illuminates your chart, just as the blazing Sun domi-
nates the sky.

he first of the four traditional elements is fire, and you don’t need to be
an astrologer to guess what it means. Ancient astrologers linked fire with
the vital force of creation. (Think of the original fireball: the Big Bang.) This
association stands. Fire generates heat in the form of excitement, activity,
and desire. People born under these dynamic, extroverted signs are vigorous
and volatile, enterprising and courageous. They’re also restless and impa-
tient, with a ready supply of creativity and vision. But they have trouble
accepting limits — which may be why they’re prone to burn out.
In the cycle of the zodiac, every element has its function. Earth offers stabil-
ity. Air communicates. Water imparts emotion. But only Fire can provide the
initial burst of energy — the creative spark that sets the world in motion.
Figure 4-1, which combines the circle of potential with the dot of individual-
ity, represents the Sun. The Sun’s placement in the sky at the moment of your
birth determines your sign. If you have any doubt about your Sun sign or
were born at the beginning or end of a sign, check out Chapter 1.
Astrologers allot three signs of the zodiac to each of the four elements. The
fire signs, which are known for their energy and drive, include the following:
Figure 4-1:
The symbol
of the Sun.

 Aries the Ram (March 20 to April 18), the sign of cardinal fire. It’s impul-
sive, daring, and gifted at setting things into motion.
 Leo the Lion (July 23 to August 22), the sign of fixed fire. It’s vibrant, 
confident, and brimming with determination.
 Sagittarius the Archer (November 22 to December 21), the sign of 
mutable fire. It’s independent, adventurous, and spontaneous.
Even though these signs differ in many ways, they share the life-affirming
vitality that fire brings. In this chapter, I discuss the fire signs. If you were
born under one of them, you’re in the right place. Here I present your good
traits and your not-so-good traits, as well as information about work and 
relationships.
Each sign has an element (fire, earth, air, or water), a polarity (positive or
negative), and a quality or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). For more on
those terms, turn to Chapter 1.
Aries the Ram: March 20–April 18
The astrological year starts on the spring equinox, which is the first day of
Aries, the sign of the Ram. Because you’re ruled by Mars, the planet named
after the Roman god of war, you’re spirited, straightforward, courageous, and
enterprising. Yours is the sign of new beginnings.
The glyph (written symbol) of Aries appears in Figure 4-2. It signifies the head
of the ram, a gushing fountain of energy, or the eyebrows and nose of a
human being — a part of the face that’s well-defined and graceful on a typical
Aries.
The sunny side
Enthusiastic, inspiring, and exhilarating, Aries is a force of nature like no
other. Blessed with boundless energy and a bold, appealing personality, you
have a zest for life that other signs can only envy. You’re intrepid, passionate,
and courageous — a firebrand, glowing and full of flash. Unconventional and
joyously individualistic, you display a robust sense of who you are and an
Figure 4-2:

the Ram.
42
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

eagerness to follow your own intuition. You have a sense of purpose and a
distinct personal style, and you refuse to let others define you. Often a crea-
ture of extremes, you react quickly and make instantaneous decisions. You
believe in action and proudly stand up for what you know is right, even if it
conflicts with commonly held notions. Neither a joiner nor a follower, you’re
a natural-born leader because you have a clear, decisive mind combined with
total faith in your own reactions and plans.
At your audacious best, you’re untiring, ardent, and thoroughly original.
You’re an activist on your own behalf, and you have initiative. A risk-taker
with a pioneering spirit, you have a deep need to prove yourself. So when a
fresh idea or a groundbreaking mission captures your imagination, you rush
in. Later on, if your interest falters or your hopes don’t pan out, you move on,
undaunted. Life is too short to waste on anything that fails to please you.
The sorry side
Like a child, you can be self-centered, inconsiderate, and intent on doing
things your way. Your determination is often unbreakable. When you really
want something, you can be combative, brash, and even ruthless in your
efforts to get it. You’re willing to take risks and you do a lot of rule breaking, a
trait that doesn’t always work to your benefit. Rather than bending to some-
one else’s requirements, you prefer to simply obey your instincts. At times
you exhibit a woeful lack of foresight, and you often lack diligence. Although
your enthusiasms are many, you easily become restless and your initial inter-
est soon fizzles. Your impatience is legendary. For that reason, you find
greater satisfaction with short-term ventures than with lengthy ones.
Emotionally, you find it difficult to imagine how other people feel. You can
strike people as insensitive, egocentric, and self-absorbed. And there’s no
avoiding the fact that you have a white-hot temper: It comes and goes in a
flash, but when it appears, you’re terrifying. You hold strong opinions, and
you’re not afraid to express them, no matter how impolitic (or impolite) they
may be. You figure it this way: If expressing your views causes others discom-
fort, let them nurse their fragile sensibilities on their own. You have too much
to do to sit around obsessing over hurt feelings, criticism, or the sorrows and
injustices of the past.
Relationships
Anyone who knows you — from friends and family to the most casual of
acquaintances — knows where you stand. Outspoken and direct, you don’t
hesitate to express yourself, and you have little patience for those who can’t
take the heat. Besides, you enjoy your own company entirely too much to 
tolerate anyone who requires coddling. Self-sufficient and independent, you
43
Chapter 4: Fire Signs: Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius

prefer your friends to be as on-the-move as you are, and you can’t bear whin-
ing. As for love, you’re an exciting person to be around, overflowing with
enthusiasm and joie de vivre. Although you suffer from jealousy and can be
competitive, you enjoy the chase — not that you let it drag on for too long.
You’re not a game player. You know what you like, and when you find it, you
go for it. And did I mention that you’re sexually ravenous?
At the same time, you’re an idealist who’s fully prepared to hold out for the
real thing. You demand equality, and if you don’t get it, you make your dis-
pleasure clear. With Mars, the warrior planet, as your ruler, you seldom shy
away from confrontation. And even though you don’t mean to be contentious,
at times you can’t help yourself. You’re not one to suppress your feelings or
to spend endless hours delving into the intricacies of your own — or anyone
else’s — psyche. You’d rather face the issues head-on. Your combustible,
intimidating exterior may mask feelings of inferiority, but most people won’t
realize that. All they know is that you’re a force to be reckoned with.
For information on your relationships with other signs, flip to Chapter 15.
Work
With your executive decision-making ability and general verve, you’re a self-
starter and an effective leader who likes to initiate change. Ambitious and
competitive, you rise to a challenge. But you’re a sprinter, not a long-distance
runner. You love the unmistakable thrill that comes at the beginning of an
undertaking, when creative momentum is high and the possibilities are wide
open. You’re delighted to experiment and innovate. But once things have set-
tled into a routine and the endeavor becomes weighted down with proce-
dures, precedents, and supervisors, your excitement wanes. You find it
irritating and dispiriting to spend time focusing on details and loose ends or
doing standard maintenance tasks. Not surprisingly, quitting too soon is one
of your worst — and most frequent — mistakes.
You’re happiest working on your own or being the boss, preferably in an
enterprise that allows you to be in charge of your own schedule. Physical
activity is a definite plus, as is the opportunity to participate in a variety of
tasks. You’re easily bored, and your need to express yourself is stronger than
your need for security. Pie-in-the-sky careers for Aries include being a film
director like Francis Ford Coppola, an action star (or motorcyclist) like Steve
McQueen, a military leader like General Colin Powell, or a talk show host like
David Letterman. Surgery is said to be an Aries profession, as is anything that
involves fire (including cooking) and anything with a high risk quotient.
Whatever your true vocation, it’s not something you choose for money or
prestige. Instead, you’re drawn to it because it offers you a way to make an
impact on the world — and at the same time to express your incomparable,
amazing self.
44
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

If you work for an Aries, your boss will most likely be assertive, enterprising,
and impatient with anyone who can’t keep up or who requires a lot of super-
vision. Your best move is to work independently — and don’t take those
angry outbursts personally.

The swirling glyph of Leo (see Figure 4-3) represents the lion’s tail, the lion’s
mane, or the creative force of the Sun.
The sunny side
You’ve got flair. If you’re a typical Leo, you’re outgoing, loyal, determined,
cheerful, and likable. You’re active, with an astoundingly busy social calendar
and a pile of responsibilities. Whatever you may do for a living, your sched-
ule is crammed full. You aim to live life to the fullest — and have a good time
while you’re at it. Even in ordinary conversations, you fall into the role of
entertaining other people because you love to be the center of attention —
and with the Sun as your ruling planet, you really do light up the room.
Equipped with a lively sense of humor, vividly rendered opinions, and the
ability to have fun even under adverse conditions, you present yourself with
confidence and pizazz. Radiant and proud, you have charisma to burn.
You also have a king-of-the-jungle sense of dignity — and an equally regal
sense of entitlement to go with it. You appreciate luxury and glamour in all
their forms. (Your color is gold, your metal is gold, and your aura is gold.) Yet
despite your aristocratic ways and your need to be pampered, you respect
hard work and are willing to shoulder more than your share of the responsi-
bility. Although you can be demanding, you value loyalty and return it in kind.
You’re helpful and generous, a staunch supporter of an underdog or a friend
in distress. And you bring the party with you. Naturally, you want to be
acknowledged. What’s wrong with that?
The sorry side
Beneath your flamboyant exterior, you would be humiliated if anyone ever
knew how hard you try or how vulnerable you feel. In your desperate efforts
to get people to like you, you hog center stage, sometimes reducing everyone
around you to audience members. (You should know that most people don’t
enjoy that role.) You’re inclined to tell people what you think they want to
hear, even if it means weaseling out later when the truth is revealed. You tend
to exaggerate, partially because you want to tell a riveting story and partially
because you want to cast yourself in a flattering light. It’s a matter of strat-
egy: You figure that if you play your cards right, you’ll triumph.
Figure 4-3:
The glyph of
Leo.
46
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

You can also be arrogant, overbearing, vain, self-aggrandizing, and 
histrionic — a real drama queen. You can be dogmatic about the tiniest
things — shampoo, say. Or barbecue sauce. Or what other people ought to
do with their lives. I don’t mean to be harsh, but your urge to give unsolicited
advice gets old, even though your motivation is noble. An idealist of the first
order, you know what life ought to be. If only you could figure out how to
make it happen — and how to convince other people to play their parts.
You’re more demanding than you realize — and more controlling. And you
find it difficult to admit mistakes. When you calm down and stop manipulat-
ing, your warmth and generosity come through, and you command the 
adoration that you crave.
Relationships
Your self-assurance and easy-going humor draw a crowd. The center of any
social scene, you’re an accomplished party-thrower and a sought-after dinner
guest. Although you like to maintain the upper hand in a relationship, and you
rely on the attentions of others to keep your ego in shape, you also know how
to bestow affection and admiration. People feel privileged to be your friend.
As for romance, Leo loves to be in love and believes in everything symbolic
of that state — from Saturday night (which is sacred) to flowers, phone calls,
breakfast in bed, loads of sex, and plenty of bling. (I’ve known Leos to leave
dog-eared copies of the Tiffany catalogue on the breakfast table, just to make
sure the message comes across.) You’re definitely high maintenance, though
you undoubtedly think otherwise. When times are good, you’re passionate,
accommodating, supportive, and adoring. When things are falling apart, you
do too, becoming domineering, arrogant, and jealous. Should a hot affair cool
into dull predictability, you may even stir things up, just to keep life interest-
ing. And when your beloved disappoints you, you’re devastated, even if you
don’t let it show. For all your bluster, you have a tender heart.
Finally, I want to add a note about animals. In traditional astrological lore,
pets aren’t associated with Leo. But I have noticed that the people I know
who treat their pets like family, cart them around in Louis Vuitton cases, pur-
chase wardrobes for them, publish books about them, or appear on televi-
sion with their squirming bulldogs on their laps to protest against puppy
mills, are overwhelmingly Leos. Not every Leo has a pet, and some wouldn’t
dream of it. (They don’t want to be upstaged.) But those who do value their
four-legged friends invest themselves fully in the relationship.
For information on Leo’s relationships with other signs, take a look at
Chapter 15.
47
Chapter 4: Fire Signs: Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius

Work
Because Leos enjoy basking in the limelight, people occasionally assume that
you aren’t hard-working. This judgment couldn’t be further from the truth.
Leos are hugely ambitious and somewhat opportunistic. You’re resourceful and
productive, a skilled organizer with a sharp business sense. Many Leos specu-
late with abandon. You seek recognition more than most, fantasize about fame,
and are willing to work at maximum intensity. If you’re at the top of the heap,
even in a tiny, home-based business, you feel powerful and magnanimous. You
happily make room for others, both as partners and as employees, and you’re
not afraid to get your hands dirty or to share a pizza with the part-time staff.
But no matter how gratifying your job may be in other respects, you can’t
exist without a little razzle-dazzle. Ideal careers are musician (Madonna),
actor (Halle Berry), clothing designer (Coco Chanel), politician (Bill Clinton,
Barack Obama), and anything that’s likely to put you in front of a group of
people. Fifth-grade teacher? Fine. Lawyer? Sure, especially if you can strut
your stuff in court. President of anything? Absolutely. Star of screen and
stage? Now you’re talking.
If you work for a Leo, be prepared to work intensely (except when your boss
is in the mood to talk), to shower him or her with respect and compliments,
and to step politely aside whenever the spotlight is turned on. Your alle-
giance and your skill will be privately recognized — and rewarded. Leo is
warm and generous. But remember, Leo rules. The term of art here is 
“benevolent despot.”

Sagittarius the Archer: November 22–

Independent, lively, and brimming with an irrepressible sense of possibility,
you feel most vibrantly alive when you’re having an adventure in the world.
For that you can thank Jupiter, your ruler, the planet of expansion and good
fortune.
The glyph of Sagittarius (see Figure 4-4) represents the centaur’s arrow and
your high aspirations.
The sunny side
At your happiest and best, you’re a free spirit, a cheerful wanderer, an honest
and intelligent companion, and a philosopher who likes to ponder the big
questions — preferably with a few pals and a plentiful supply of snacks. You
see life as an ongoing quest for experience and wisdom, not as a search for
security. Restless and excitable, with a rapid-fire wit, you chafe under restric-
tion and demand autonomy, which you happily extend to others.
In your eternal quest for experience and knowledge, you pursue a multitude
of interests and you set ambitious, wide-ranging goals for yourself. You 
want to see the world and understand it, which is why your sign rules travel,
philosophy, religion, law, and abstractions of all kinds. Sagittarius is free-
thinking, casual, open-minded, and optimistic (though a couple of planets in
Figure 4-4:

Chapter 4: Fire Signs: Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius

Scorpio can dampen your spirits and add a touch of melancholy). You con-
nect easily with all kinds of people and are said to be lucky. The truth is that
your spontaneous decisions and out-there gambles occasionally pay off, but
what benefits you the most is your fearless attitude. Sure, troubles may
come. No one is immune to that. But ultimately, buoyed by your curiosity and
belief in the future, you bounce back. You look at it this way: What other
choice is there?
The sorry side
Like the centaur, your half-human, half-horse symbol, you’re divided. Part of
you aspires to party into the night (that’s the quadruped half). The other part
of you aims high, longing to expand your mind and explore the infinite
reaches of the spirit. Sounds good, but you can be a blowhard — and without
a target, you flounder. Impractical and disorganized, you’re easily sidetracked
and must battle a tendency to procrastinate. You fritter away endless
amounts of time and energy (and money). Moreover, you can be unreliable,
with an unfortunate tendency to promise more than you can actually deliver.
You don’t mean to misrepresent yourself; it’s just that your innate optimism
causes you to overestimate your ability.
A peculiar fact about Sagittarius is that although you supposedly love the
outdoors, you may not spend much time there. (As Sagittarian Woody Allen
said, “I’m at two with nature.”) And though you thrive on exercise, you can be
physically clumsy. More significantly, you can be dogmatic and fanatical, with
an exasperating propensity to preach. Finally, there’s your legendary tactless-
ness. You haven’t learned to lie, even when it’s a kindness to do so. A friend
shows up with badly cropped hair or a hideous new outfit? You blurt out the
unflattering truth. It’s the flip side of your honesty — and it’s nothing to be
proud of.
Relationships
Funny, generous, enthusiastic, and direct, the Archer loves to talk and makes
friends easily. Stimulating conversation and a clever sense of humor carry a
lot of weight with you. You also prize personal freedom, making romance
much trickier than friendship. Despite a tendency to take risks in other areas,
you tend to hold back romantically and are famous for being resistant to
commitment. Whether you come across as a Don Juan, an inconstant lover,
or a monk-in-training, you usually manage to maintain your independence,
even at the cost of occasional loneliness. Besides, you’re an optimist (though
you may think otherwise). So why settle for someone who’s less than perfect
when Match.com alone offers thousands of eligible soul mates at the click of
50
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

a mouse? No wonder it’s hard to choose. Denizens of other signs may rush to
the altar, anxious to pair up and settle down. You have fantasies aplenty —
but they’re not about weddings, gift registries, mortgages, or twins. You’d just
as soon see the world and develop some of your own talents.
When you do ultimately connect (and fear not, it happens all the time), you
sincerely hope that the relationship will lead to a larger, more fulfilling life —
not a more constrained one. You have nothing against domesticity, but it is
not your dream, and stability is not your guiding principle. Instead, you seek
a life of adventure, be it literal, intellectual, or spiritual, with plenty of laughs
along the way — and an active, accomplished companion who doesn’t mind
being with someone as independent as you. Even in a fully committed, deeply
passionate relationship, Sagittarius always needs some space.
For information on the Archer’s relationships with other signs, turn to
Chapter 15.
Work
Sagittarius is the sign of higher education, and the professions associated
with the sign reflect that. Blessed with a love of learning and a yearning 
to do something that matters, you’re well suited for teaching, publishing,
journalism, law, religion, communications, and anything involving interna-
tional relations or travel. You dislike bureaucracy and grow restless in a
rigidly structured organization. Whatever you do, your intellect needs to be
engaged. Versatile and quick, you’re easily distracted and may accept a
hodgepodge of assignments just to keep things interesting. Big projects and
high ideals excite you. Bookkeeping doesn’t. Financial management doesn’t.
Indeed, it’s the small stuff that trips you up — and yet your professional suc-
cess depends upon your ability to handle the details.
Learning to delegate is another one of your challenges. A natural egalitarian,
you hate to request assistance and are uncomfortable asking others to per-
form the dull tasks you’d just as soon dodge yourself. Finally, you may face
issues of time management. In a world full of fascinating distractions, it’s
essential to use your time to advantage. But you already know that.
If you work for a Sagittarian, your essential task is to keep the big picture in
mind and make sure things are moving forward. If your work is generally on
target, the Archer won’t nitpick you to death. Sagittarius isn’t a microman-
ager. On the other hand, if you need help with something specific, you may
not get it. After all, you already received a rundown of the situation — right?
And be prepared: Detail-averse Sagittarians don’t object to working overtime.
If you’re a strict 9-to-5er, the Archer may question your commitment.

Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo, 
and Capricorn
In This Chapter
 Considering Taurus
 Focusing on Virgo
 Contemplating Capricorn
Just as the universe burst into existence with the fireball of the Big Bang,
the cycle of the zodiac lifts off with a blast of fire, the most energetic of
the four traditional elements. Fire creates heat, light, and movement. But
what’s the point of all that combustion if it leads to nothing? Without earth,
fire would burn itself out like a spray of fireworks against the night sky. Earth
signs ground the energy of fire by turning the sizzle into something tangible.
Cautious where fire is bold, earth signs are stable, sensible, productive, per-
sistent, and materialistic — and I don’t mean that in a bad way. Unlike less
realistic signs, earth signs understand and respect material things, including
money. They’re also sensuous, responsive human beings who glory in the
physical world in all its splendor.
Fire sends off sparks, no question. Air talks up a storm. And no one under-
stands the impact of emotion like Water. But if you want to actually get 
something done, look to Earth.
Astrological tradition allots three signs to each of the four elements. The
earth signs, recognized for their productivity and pragmatic approach to life,
include the following:
 Taurus the Bull (April 19 to May 20), the sign of fixed earth. Taurus is
known for its persistence, its longing for security, and — in case you
thought that earth signs are only about practicality — its love of pleasure.
 Virgo the Virgin (August 23 to September 22), the sign of mutable earth.
Virgo is famed for its analytical mind, its attention to detail, and its 
tendency to be a perfectionist.

 Capricorn the Goat (December 22 to January 19), the sign of cardinal
fire. The Goat is resourceful, conscientious, and ambitious.
These signs share a desire to make a tangible contribution. If earth is your
element, read on. In this chapter, I present your great traits and your grating
traits, along with information about relationships and work.
The sun’s position in the heavens at the time of your birth determines your
sign. If you were born at the beginning or end of a sign or you’re unsure about
your sign, turn to Chapter 1 and read the section entitled “Born on the Cusp.”
Also, in addition to its element, each sign has a polarity (positive or negative)
and a quality or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). For more on these
terms, refer to Chapter 1.
Taurus the Bull: April 19–May 20
When Harry Truman was president, a sign in the oval office read “The buck
stops here.” That’s just what you might expect from a Taurus. In good times
and in bad, you’re steadfast, dependable, and willing to accept responsibility.
But Taurus also has a pleasure-loving side, for it is ruled by Venus, the
guardian of love and art. Truman knew something about that part of life too.
A devoted husband and fiercely protective father, he was a gifted piano
player who thought about becoming a professional musician. He decided that
he didn’t have what it takes. “A good music-hall piano player is about the
best I’d have ever been,” he said. “So I went into politics and became
President of the United States.” Taurus has the stamina and the persistence
to make something like that possible.
The symbol (or glyph) of Taurus, shown in Figure 5-1, represents the head
and horns of the Bull — or the circle of potential topped by the crescent of
receptivity.
The sunny side
In the cycle of the zodiac, Aries, the pioneer, arrives first, spewing energy in
every direction. Taurus, the second sign, brings that energy down to earth
and uses it to build something solid. As a fixed earth sign, you’re cautious,
Figure 5-1:
The symbol
of Taurus.
54
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

grounded in reality, steady on your feet, and utterly reliable. Because you
have an intense need for security, both emotional and financial, you make
conservative choices and try to avoid change. You hold on tightly, only giving
up when there’s no other option. But once you’ve made a decision, nothing
can convince you to change your mind. Concrete goals make the most sense
to you. You pursue them quietly and with single-minded determination. It’s
true that you may not reach your destination quickly — but like the leg-
endary tortoise to whom you’re often compared, you do get there.
As an earth sign, you’re at home in your body and attuned to your environ-
ment. Romantic and sensuous, kind and gentle, you’re responsive to com-
forts of every kind, and your senses are wide open. You love slow, languid
sex; the textures of silk and velvet (and corduroy); freshly baked bread; full-
bodied red wine; nature in all its seasons; and handcrafted objects, which
you acquire with ease and never cease to enjoy. Taurus is also creatively
gifted. Chances are you have talent in at least one of the arts, including
music, dance, sculpture, painting, design, architecture, cooking, gardening,
and the fine art of relaxing.
The sorry side
Although your dedication is impressive, your leisurely pace can drive other
people to distraction. You start slowly, tend to plod, and refuse to be rushed.
You can be stodgy at an early age, and you can easily fall into a rut. Plus,
you’re incredibly stubborn. Your well-known tenacity is a positive trait when
it means sticking up for moral principles (think of Coretta Scott King or Bono,
the Taurus rock singer who was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize). Too
often, though, it means refusing to change, no matter what the circum-
stances. I’ve seen Taureans cling to outmoded, self-destructive patterns for
years just because they didn’t want to risk trying a new approach or making
amends. That’s what being bull-headed can mean.
As long as we’re discussing your negative traits, let me add that you can be
greedy, status conscious, acquisitive, gluttonous, self-indulgent, and self-
pitying. Normally, you’re hard-working and persevering, but when you’re
down, you become apathetic. You can also be possessive, dependent, jeal-
ous, insensitive and, at your worst, a user. You don’t intend to exploit other
people. But — you know — things happen.
One more thing: Taurus, unlike Aries, doesn’t get angry easily, for which the
rest of the world is grateful. But when you do blow up . . . let’s just say that
some of the worst mass murderers and dictators in history — men like Hitler,
Lenin, and Saddam Hussein — were born under the sign of the Bull.

Chapter 5: Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn

Relationships
With Venus as your ruling planet, you’re appealing and affectionate, and you
effortlessly attract friends, lovers, and sidekicks. Romance is hugely impor-
tant to you but (with rare exceptions) you won’t go after it aggressively.
Quietly seductive, you give subtle signals, and if the object of your desire
turns out to be immune, you look elsewhere.
Your feelings run deep, but it’s not excitement you seek; it’s sanctuary. In
your heart, familiarity breeds contentment. You relish the daily, domestic rit-
uals along with the security of a long-running relationship. When you’re in a
secure partnership, you hold on tightly. You’re loving, protective, and sup-
portive, even if you’re also dependent and possessive.
Although you dislike conflict and try to avoid it, you don’t back down either.
If a relationship is on shaky ground, you can hardly bear the tension. Some
people (Leo and Scorpio, for example) get all caught up in those romantic
ups and downs. They throw themselves into the drama and even find it titil-
lating. Not Taurus. Sincere and intense, you play for keeps because you’re not
playing. For you, love isn’t a game.
For the lowdown on your relationships with other signs, turn to Chapter 15.
Work
Because you adore the creature comforts and lack that manic hit that often
characterizes high achievers, people may assume that you’re lazy. They
couldn’t be more wrong. Though your ability to lounge around on weekends
is without equal, you’re diligent, productive, and organized when you want to
be, with an inborn need to do something constructive. Security is essential to
you, whether that means money in the bank, real estate, a first-rate pension
plan, or all of the above. And yet, that’s not where you live. At bottom, it’s
more important for you to believe in what you’re doing and to find a mod-
icum of creative expression. When you identify an area that satisfies those
needs, you’re willing to make financial sacrifices.
Whatever you choose, you work at a steady pace. And unlike other signs, you
aren’t constantly trying to elbow your way into the spotlight. Naturally,
people come to rely on you. And yes, it sometimes feels as though you’re
doing more than your share of the work for less than your share of the recog-
nition. That’s one of the drawbacks of being an earth sign.
Working with the Bull is easier if you accept the fact that he knows what he
wants and he’s unlikely to change. He values productivity, follow-through,
loyalty, and the ability to stay cool. As for those brilliant ideas you have
about how to shake things up, keep them to yourself. They will only make
him distrust your judgment.

Virgo the Virgin: August 23–

The mind of a Virgo is a wondrous thing. Thanks to Mercury, the planet
named after the quick-witted god of communication, you’re observant,
insightful, capable, and articulate. You’re also discriminating and critical,
especially of yourself. Constantly in search of self-improvement, you consider
yourself a work in progress.
The symbol of Virgo the Virgin (see Figure 5-2) resembles an M with a closed-
in loop. It signifies the female genitals, in contrast to Scorpio, which repre-
sents the male.

The sunny side
Nothing sneaks past you. You have an eye for detail, an inborn sense of effi-
ciency, and a supreme sensitivity to the implications of language. Smart,
funny, and engaging, you can claim extraordinary analytical abilities, a rare
clarity of mind, an enviable capacity for concentration, and a love of learning
that isn’t just for show. On top of that, you’re considerate and appealingly
modest. You know you’re not perfect — but you’re doing just about every-
thing you can to get there. Like the other earth signs, you’re conscientious,
industrious, and efficient. Unlike them, you’re also an idealist. You know how
things ought to be, and you’re certain that you can make them that way, one
detail at a time. Armed with your lengthy to-do list, you’re organized and dis-
ciplined, ready to push yourself to the limit. You’re equally willing to assist
other people, an offer that extends way beyond your immediate circle. You
have a strong moral core and can be helpful to the point of selflessness.
People often forget that Virgo is the sign of service. (Think of Mother Teresa.)
Acting on behalf of others makes you feel good about yourself.
The sorry side
You’re too hard on everyone, yourself included. You nag. You criticize. You
can’t distinguish between that which is acceptable (your spouse) and that
which is ideal (your spouse, if only he would shape up). You can be incredi-
bly demanding — and incredibly disappointed when your demands aren’t
met. At times you act the part of the martyr who’s compelled to put up with
the inadequacies of others, but you also suffer from waves of guilt, inferiority,
shyness, and anxiety. You worry about the air, the water, global warming, war,
calories, the homeless person you passed on the street, the insensitive
remark you’re afraid you may have made, your investments, and your body.
In the life of a typical Virgo, hypochondria is a dragon you have to slay
(which is one reason Virgos often immerse themselves in the Merck Manual
or become fascinated by alternative healing techniques). A healthful diet, suf-
ficient exercise, and a reliable method for reducing stress are essential.
A note on neatness: No matter what you may have heard, not all Virgos are
neatness fiends. Not that it doesn’t happen: I’ve known Virgos who can’t rest
unless everything in the refrigerator is arranged parallel to the door. I’ve
known Virgos who have genuine opinions about tile cleansers. I’ve also
Figure 5-2:
The symbol

58
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

known Virgos who are incapable of throwing things out. Their intention is to
do something with all that stuff. Meanwhile, they don’t look compulsive in
the least; they look like world-class slobs.
Relationships
You’d think that a sign supposedly as critical as Virgo would have trouble
making friends. But this isn’t the case. Virgos love to converse, excel at ana-
lyzing other people, dote on exploring new ideas, and maintain a multitude of
interests. Conversation with a Virgo is never dull. Virgos also remember
birthdays, bring chicken soup and DVDs to ailing friends, and generally
extend themselves. So you don’t lack for a busy social life — even if you are a
little heavy-handed with the advice from time to time.
In a committed relationship, you’re most comfortable when your role and
responsibilities are clearly defined. When you don’t know what to expect or
those roles are shifting under the pressure of circumstances, you become jit-
tery, insomniac, withholding, and — your worst mistake — controlling. You
don’t mean to be — you just want to make sure that everything is on course.
You have a powerful sense of the way things should be, and when reality con-
flicts with your impossibly high standards, you slip into a state of denial and
see what you want to see. When breakups occur, you’re stunned. For all your
good sense, a Virgo with a broken heart is a pathetic creature indeed.
Fortunately, you aren’t one to spend your life sobbing into your limited-edi-
tion designer brew. Inevitably, you find a way to turn things around. You have
no trouble attracting admirers, for Virgo can be incredibly seductive, despite
its virginal image. (Iconic Virgo sex symbols include Sean Connery, Richard
Gere, Sophia Loren, and Greta Garbo.) But that’s not what helps you get
through tough times. It’s your mental ability to reframe a situation. Sure,
things may look bad from one angle. But from another . . . 
For the scoop on Virgo’s relationships with other signs, check out Chapter 15.
Work
It’s difficult to imagine an organization that wouldn’t benefit from having a
Virgo or two around. The master of multi-tasking, you easily juggle hundreds
of details and dozens of conflicting demands. Organized and meticulous,
you’re skilled at teaching, writing (and other forms of communication), and
anything that requires an analytical mind and attention to detail. But no
matter what direction you go in, more work ends up on your desk than on
anyone else’s because, guess what? You’re more efficient than anyone else.
That’s why the powers-that-be keep calling on you. No one else is up to the
job — and you may not want to do it either. Even so, you produce accurate,
59
Chapter 5: Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn

timely results because you can’t resist rising to a challenge. Might as well
admit the truth: You can’t resist the compliment, and you take secret plea-
sure in tucking in every last detail. You’re the ideal employee, like it or not —
which may be why Virgos often fantasize about owning their own businesses.
The degree of control you gain as an entrepreneur is tonic for your soul.
If you work for a Virgo, follow instructions to the letter and obey the unstated
rules of the workplace. On the surface, the environment may be casual and
egalitarian. Nonetheless, the standards are strict. So go ahead and request
instruction and clarification when you need it. Virgo will respect you for
asking. Similarly, feel free to ask for feedback. But understand that after you
receive advice, you must make a sincere effort at following it. Otherwise,
Virgo may perceive your request as a waste of time. And take my word for it:
You don’t want to waste a Virgo’s time.

Capricorn the Goat: December 22–
January 19
Somebody has to uphold tradition. Somebody has to follow the rules. For
that matter, somebody has to write them. With somber Saturn, the planet of
structure, as your ruler, it may as well be you.
The glyph of Capricorn (see Figure 5-3) represents either the mountain goat
with its curling horns or the mythical creature who is a goat above and a fish
below.
The sunny side
You’re productive, responsible, competitive, and mature. You’re an adult —
even as a child. Indeed, Capricorn often has a tough time as a youngster
because you’re more serious than most people. You come into your own in
adulthood, and you age beautifully. Although there may be occasional dips
along the way, it’s a well-recognized phenomenon that the older you get, the
happier you become. It’s the miracle of Capricorn.
You’re ambitious. Like the mountain goat that clambers over rocky terrain to
reach the summit, you have your eye on a distant peak — and you’ve figured
out a strategy for getting there. Patient, industrious, and thrifty, you bravely
weather any difficulties you encounter along the way. Society depends on
Capricorn because you have the ability to step outside of yourself, to con-
sider the needs of others, and to develop realistic strategies for fulfilling
those needs. You’re a natural leader.
Though you may panic internally during times of stress, externally you stay
calm. Unlike other signs I can name (Sagittarius, say, or Pisces), you know
how to apply self-discipline — and, unlike Virgo, you can do so without
making a fetish of it. Your control is obvious in every cell of your body. You’re
cool, reserved, dignified, and authoritative. As an earth sign, you see what
needs to be done and you act expeditiously. And though you often have trou-
ble loosening up, you have that earth-sign sensuality to indulge in. You
respond to timeless art, true love, and the pleasures of the kitchen, the bed-
room, and the boardroom — up to and including a nice fat investment portfo-
lio. Say what you will, money does provide security.
Figure 5-3:
The 
symbol of
Capricorn.
61
Chapter 5: Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn

The sorry side
A natural-born conservative, no matter what your politics may be, you have a
plan (and a budget) for everything. Status-conscious and money-minded, you
can be fearful, repressed, and pessimistic. You have such a deep sense of pur-
pose that you find it difficult to relax: Taking time off feels like breaking stride
to you, and you don’t want to do it. After all, there’s more to be done . . . much
more. You’re frustrated by your slow progress. The truth is that if it weren’t
for other people, you’d live on the treadmill. You’re the least spontaneous sign
of the zodiac. A little resiliency would lighten your considerable load but it
isn’t easy for you to bend. I hesitate to say “You work too hard” only because 
I know that you will agree — and secretly take it as a compliment.
Here’s another problem: Emotional issues can be threatening to a Capricorn.
Even with friends, you’d rather not discuss feelings at all, thank you. No one
likes to reveal weakness, but for you it’s especially painful. So you suffer in
silence and are prone to denial. Why see what you don’t want to see? What’s
the point of gazing into the heart of darkness — or the void at the center of a
bad relationship — if you aren’t prepared to do anything about it? It may be
better not to know. Right?
Right. Except that sometimes facing the truth is the only way to make things
better.
Relationships
Begin by acknowledging that Capricorn has a strong sense of privacy, propri-
ety, and emotional reserve. Even your oldest friends don’t get too close. You
admire them for their accomplishments and sympathize with them for their
troubles. You’re not unkind. But you’re uncomfortable with emotional dis-
plays and would just as soon not have to be there during times of major
crisis. (You would rather help by doing something practical.) In love, too, you
go out of your way to avoid pyrotechnics. You just can’t stand it.
On the other hand, you’re a traditionalist with a strong sex drive and a deep
need to be comforted, admired, and connected. Your ideal partner is accom-
plished, well put-together, and worthy in the eyes of the world. You can’t help
responding to the confidence that success brings. What’s so terrible about
that?
When you find the right person — and it can take awhile — you’re faithful and
devoted. Playing around isn’t your style. Playing traditional gender roles is.
Although you believe in gender equality, you still feel comfortable with a stan-
dard male/female role division. If there is a problem, it may be simply that you
take everything very seriously. A pillow fight on a weeknight? No way! You
62
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

need 7.5 hours of sleep, and not a nanosecond less. An afternoon tryst with
your beloved? Are you joking? You have a job! In Capricorn relationships, it’s
generally the other person who tries to provide the laughs (and the spontane-
ity). Someone’s gotta lighten things up — and it probably won’t be you.
For specifics on the Goat’s interactions with other signs, flip to Chapter 15.
Work
Can you say workaholic? Capricorn is the most ambitious, industrious sign of
the zodiac. You accept responsibility without complaint. You know how to
operate within an organization, large or small, and when a structure is lack-
ing, you know how to create one. You may not like bureaucracy, but you
understand it, and you’re at home in a corporation. Naturally you crave
recognition. And let’s face it: Although recognition comes in many guises, its
primary form is money. You understand the stuff. Occasionally, you even
become obsessed with it because money is a sign of accomplishment.
Consider, for example, this remark from the eccentric, obsessive-compulsive
tycoon Howard Hughes. “I’m not a paranoid deranged millionaire,” he said.
“Goddamit, I’m a billionaire.”
So, yes, some Capricorns are covetous and materialistic. Most are not. And
many of you have a little-recognized ability to put the good of others ahead of
your selfish desires. Not for nothing was Martin Luther King, Jr., a Capricorn.
Those born under the sign of the Goat, despite a reputation for capitalist
venality, often have a social conscience. They just don’t think they should
have to suffer for it.
If you work for a Capricorn, everything you ever learned about how to behave
at work applies: Be on time, dress for the next level up, anticipate your boss’s
needs, be organized, and so forth. Avoid office pranks: Naked pictures on the
copier won’t amuse your straight-arrow boss. And make sure that nothing 
suspect appears on your computer screen — and that includes solitaire.
Remember: Capricorns wrote the rules. You’d be a fool to break them.

 Assessing Aquarius
A
ir represents intelligence and reason. It’s the element of the intellect,
and those born under its influence are known for their ability to connect
the dots. Air signs are bright, curious, versatile, and intellectually restless.
Their minds are always active, always searching for understanding. Crazy as
it may sound, natives of those signs actually think about things, and they try
to do it objectively and in depth. They value ideas and revel in conversation.
Despite their reputation for sometimes being a little too objective and
detached — let’s just say that Mr. Spock was definitely an air sign — they’re
also supremely social, linking friends, relatives, and random strangers into
networks of relationships.
By long astrological tradition, each of the four elements has been assigned to
three signs of the zodiac. The air signs, which are legendary for their mental
acuteness, include the following:
 Gemini the Twins (May 21 to June 20), the sign of mutable air. Gemini is
known for its curious, lively mind, sparkling personality, and capricious
ways.
 Libra the Scales (September 23 to October 22), the sign of cardinal air.
Libra is recognized for its balanced intellect, sense of fairness, and aes-
thetic sensitivity, as well as for the importance it places on partnership.
 Aquarius the Water Bearer (January 20 to February 18), the sign of fixed
air. Aquarius is celebrated for its forward-looking ideas, unique and
often eccentric interests, and free-spirited personality.

If your birthday falls at the beginning or end of a sign, double-check your Sun
sign by turning to Chapter 1 and reading the section entitled “Born on the
Cusp.”
Air signs share a desire to make connections and to communicate. If air is
your element, your essential qualities are discussed here. In this chapter, 
I present your most appealing traits and your most irritating ones, along with
information about relationships and work.
Besides its element, each sign has a polarity (positive or negative) and a qual-
ity or modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). For more on those terms, see
Chapter 1.
Gemini the Twins: May 21–June 20
Agile and articulate, Gemini is lively, bright, thoroughly engaged, and incredi-
bly persuasive. That’s because you’re ruled by quick-witted Mercury, the
trickster god who could wiggle his way out of anything.
The two pillars of Gemini (see the glyph in Figure 6-1) represent the mytho-
logical twins: Castor, the human son of a man, and Pollux, the immortal son of
Zeus, king of the gods. They also symbolize the two sides of your double-
sided nature.
The sunny side
Forever young, they say. You’re clever, inquisitive, gregarious, and cheerful —
and it shows in your face. In your never-ending quest for stimulation, you
habitually veer off in unexpected directions. Effervescent and up-to-date,
you’re invigorated by the latest toy, the hottest band, the most shocking
news story, and the juiciest gossip (because really, isn’t that how you learn
the ways of the world?). You’re clever and quick, excited by everything life
has to offer. You pursue a multitude of interests and love to immerse yourself
in new endeavors. When you enter a new world, you feel as if doors are
swinging open and the possibilities before you are infinite.

Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

But you’re also impatient and easily bored. To fend off the threat of ennui, it
reassures you to have two (or more) novels on your bedside table, two jobs
(preferably part-time), two love affairs (or a main one and a backup), and at
least two phones. You also maintain an ever-expanding legion of friends. Your
enthusiasm is infectious, and nothing delights you more than discovering —
or forging — connections between unexpected people or unrelated ideas.
You’re in constant motion, and you make a point of cultivating spontaneity, at
least in theory. In reality, you sometimes load yourself down with so many
activities that spontaneity becomes essentially impossible. You’re forever
squeezing in another meeting, another project, another errand, another
friend. Inevitably, you end up doing a lot of juggling. Yet the truth is this:
When you’re overcommitted and ever-so-slightly frazzled, much as you might
complain, you feel content and at home in the world.
The sorry side
A hostage to hyperactivity, you squander your resources because you can’t
resist the immediate gratification of conversing, cavorting with the cat, going
online, or simply doing something else. If you could, you’d rather be in two
places at once. Impatient and inconstant, you chatter too much, have a short
span of attention, and too often, drop the ball simply through inattention.
You’re easily distracted and often find it difficult to concentrate — or even to
sit still. In many ways, you’re like a child. When you find something that
excites you, you accelerate into overdrive. But you can exhaust your own
enthusiasm by talking it into the ground. You don’t hesitate to sing your own
praises. And although you may not notice, your intense, narcissistic focus
sometimes drains other people. Take my word for it: They aren’t as fasci-
nated as you think.
At your worst, you can be deceptive, superficial, and fickle — the living,
breathing incarnation of hot air. Astrologers (and jilted lovers) often accuse
you of being emotionally shallow. Actually, you experience real emotions —
just not for long. When troubles come, you see no point in dwelling on 
them. Instead, you push your feelings aside and adapt to the changed 
circumstances — and you do it with stunning ease. A lover breaks up with
you? Your supervisor locks your computer and escorts you to the Exit sign?
No problem. You rewrite history, and pretty soon you’re the one who walked.
You’ll deal with the repercussions down the road (if at all). Meanwhile, you
may be a bundle of nerves, but you’re busy writing a new chapter. Like
Gemini Bob Dylan, you don’t look back.

Chapter 6: Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius

Relationships
Those who have been burnt in a relationship with a Gemini often accuse
members of your sign of being unfeeling and fickle. This is unfair. I know
Geminis who have enjoyed monogamous relationships for decades. There are
many factors in a horoscope, and the Sun is only one of them.
But I’ve also known Geminis who fit the stereotype perfectly. Playful and
engaging, you love the excitement of making conquests. The banter of
courtship amuses you. As much as you may long to be in a committed rela-
tionship, you’re easily bored and essentially restless, and you soon grow dis-
enchanted. The ideal partner for you is multifaceted enough to provide the
stimulation you seek, confident enough to let you have the freedom you
enjoy, and witty enough to make you laugh. You can’t help responding to
someone who presents a challenge. An on-again, off-again relationship, I’m
sorry to say, piques your curiosity. Ultimately, you don’t need a profound
emotional connection. You also don’t need off-the-charts sex (which is not to
say that you don’t appreciate it). What you need is a lively connection that
generates sparks and engages your mind.
For details about your relationships with other signs, turn to Chapter 15.
Work
Versatile and cerebral, you have fine motor skills and are a wizard with
words. Whether you’re writing a roman à clef or building a Victorian bird-
house, ideas readily come to you because you’re stimulated by everything.
Smart and buoyant, you pick things up so fast that you practically don’t have
a learning curve. But in work (as in love), you grow quickly bored. Jobs that
require a lot of repetition, no matter how outwardly rewarding, are always a
mistake for you. You require mental stimulation, plenty of opportunity to
socialize, and a mixture of responsibilities. The best professions for you offer
variety and take advantage of your ability to communicate. Classic Gemini
careers include education, travel, writing, and anything connected with news-
papers, magazines, radio, or TV. Blogging was made for you. Inventive and
entrepreneurial, you’re skilled at creating original business ventures. Even
though the freelancer’s life isn’t for everyone, you bask in its variety and
manage the challenges (no security, no predictability, and no schedule) with
confidence. Just make sure you hire a sensible Taurus or a Capricorn to look
after your finances. Handling money is not your strength.
Working with the Twins is a challenge because they’re always prepared to
change directions on a whim — and they expect everyone else to follow suit.
If you’re working with a Gemini, your only move at these times is to shift
gears and pretend you aren’t rattled. “But you told us last week . . .” carries
no weight with a Gemini. Geminis value new ideas, flexibility, and rapid
response. They don’t care about consistency.

I grew up surrounded by Librans, and I can tell you this: Libra is the sign of
civilization. Ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty, you act rationally,
believe in fairness, and are usually easy to be around.
The glyph of Libra (see Figure 6-2) represents a simple balance or the scales
of justice. It also suggests the setting Sun, which reflects the fact that the first
day of Libra is the fall equinox, when day and night reach a point of perfect
equilibrium.
The sunny side
Where elegance meets cool, and sense meets sensibility: That’s Libra. Refined
and even-tempered, amiable and observant, you’re the ultimate diplomat
(when you want to be). You seek serenity, respond strongly to art and music,
and thrive in aesthetically agreeable surroundings (though ordinary nui-
sances like noise make you tense and tired). Your artistic sensibility is highly
developed, your social sense even more so. Easy-going, graceful, smart, and
charming, you’re a sought-after dinner party guest who very much wants to
be liked. And although you can’t stop being flirtatious, you’re also a commit-
ted partner for whom relationships are indispensable.

Libra’s

69
Chapter 6: Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius

At the same time, as an air sign, you have a sophisticated intellect and you
pride yourself on your sensible approach to life. You’re conscious of the
implications of any and all decisions. You seek out information and opposing
points of view, and you do your best not to jump to conclusions, often argu-
ing a point just to work your way around all sides of an issue. (Plus, let it be
said that you enjoy a good debate.) Because reason is a high value for you,
you naturally try to be objective. That’s the meaning of the scales, your
symbol, which represents your ability to weigh both sides of an issue as well
as your need to achieve emotional balance. (Libra is the only sign symbolized
by a physical object rather than a living creature.) Most of the time, your
thoughtful, objective approach works. The harmony and balance that you
seek are achievable.
The sorry side
As Eleanor Roosevelt, a classic Libran, once said, “Nobody can make you feel
inferior without your consent.” Well, no problem: You consent. Your amiable
personality may conceal a festering dissatisfaction and a terrible struggle
with emotional complexities. You have a deeply ingrained predisposition to
worry, combined with — at your sorriest — a woeful lack of confidence. (If
you have planets in Virgo, as many Librans do, you’re undoubtedly your own
harshest critic.) Anxious for the good opinion of others, you may try too hard
to satisfy. And yet in other ways, you don’t try hard enough. When you’re
down, you can be vague, dependent, self-indulgent, and withdrawn, and your
refined sensibilities are so easily injured that it’s sometimes laughable.
You can’t bear squabbles — and yet you’re more than capable of generating
them. Like Librans Mahatma Gandhi, the prophet of nonviolence, and John
Lennon, the antiwar rock star, you’re more contentious than your reputation
suggests.
And as much as you need balance, you have trouble maintaining it. Because
you’re a serious thinker, you can be indecisive to the point of paralysis, espe-
cially when you need to make a serious choice. Uncertainty undoes you. You
wobble back and forth, balancing pros and cons. You compare and contrast.
You work yourself up into a tizzy, becoming distant, argumentative, or
obsessed. Making up your mind so that you can move forward can be your
greatest challenge. In your search for peace, beauty, and equilibrium, you can
wear yourself out. Your best approach is the Roman one: Moderation in all
things.
70
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

Relationships
What a bundle of contradictions Libra can be. On the one hand, you’re ruled
by seductive Venus, and relationships are essential to you. Longing for love,
you instinctively look to romantic partners to balance your inadequacies and
stabilize you. On the other hand, you’re an air sign, ruled by your head — not
your heart. Thanks to your refined sensibilities and visceral distaste for tear-
soaked melodramas, you unconsciously preserve a distance meant to protect
you from conflict and emotional chaos. In relationships, as in other areas of
life, you often end up in an internal tug-of-war, first drawing close to the
object of your affection, and then pulling away. Not surprisingly, your ambiva-
lence may strike the other person as manipulative.
And what is it that you seek? The right partner has to come equipped with
the whole package: looks, brains, energy, style, manners, and a dash — or
more than a dash — of status. When you find that person, as most Librans
do, you’re loyal, loving, generous, and proud. Meanwhile, thanks to your inef-
fable charm and your ability to keep the conversation interesting, you need
never dine alone.
For insight into your relationships with other signs, go to Chapter 15.
Work
For Libra, life would be much more pleasant without the irksome necessity of
work. Because your aesthetic sense is directly related to your mood, it’s
imperative that your workspace be clean and airy with plenty of opportuni-
ties for face-to-face socializing. Finding an environment that supports you
both intellectually and socially is equally important. You aren’t enormously
ambitious, perhaps because you underrate yourself. Money is seldom your
chief motivation, but you know what you’re worth, and you’re confident
enough to ask for the recognition you deserve. Still, the day-to-day quality of
your work is what matters most.
Ideal fields include all aspects of the arts, including the visual arts, theater,
and music. Cultural organizations are natural spots for you. You can also
express your artistic talents in fashion, graphic design, interior decoration,
architecture, photography, cinema, and related fields. Other areas for which
you are equally well suited include diplomacy, mediation and negotiation, the
law (Libra makes a fine judge), and anything that requires making contact
with the public.
71
Chapter 6: Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius

If you work with or for a Libra, you have the opportunity to observe the
power of reason close up. Libra respects rational decision-making and analy-
sis. Gifted with poise and intelligence, Libra tries to be fair and expects you
to share in the spirit of compromise. It’s true that Libran decision-making can
be a lengthy process. Libra values your input. But after a decision has been
reached, Libra moves with dispatch. Two pieces of advice: Present your ideas
calmly and logically. And look your best. Libra may pretend that appearance
doesn’t matter. But others know better than to believe it.

Aquarius the Water Bearer: 
January 20–February 18
You’re an original. With unpredictable Uranus as your ruler, you’re progres-
sive, future-oriented, and prone to dazzling flashes of insight. You’re also
more idiosyncratic than you may realize.
The glyph of Aquarius the Water Bearer (see Figure 6-3) represents the waves
of water or, better yet, waves of sound, electricity, and light.
The sunny side
Very much a member of your own generation, you’re a natural visionary and
a humanitarian of the first order — at least in theory. You have high-minded
principles, and you try to live by them. Altruistic and issue-oriented, you
believe in the equality of all human beings, and you’re interested in everyone,
regardless of class, race, age, sexual orientation, or any of the other concerns
that shape life today. Exquisitely aware of the impact that those factors can
have, you possess the ability (when you so choose) to set them aside and
connect with the real human being. The terrible things that happen in the
world appall you, the issues of the day animate you, and you aren’t one to
follow a party line just because that’s what your friends believe. You have a
capacious brain, and you think for yourself.
A maverick with a lively, inventive mind, you have an off-beat set of interests
and habits. Science fiction and technology are Aquarian; so is video art and
everything indie. But whether you resonate to those particular areas isn’t the
point. (After all, not all Sagittarians go horseback riding, and — surprise! —
not every Cancer loves to cook.) The point is that you lean into the future,
not away from it. Intrigued and unafraid, you’re utterly contemporary, a com-
position in avant-garde. You’re also congenial and charismatic. You accumu-
late a variety of friends (and to your perverse joy, they often disapprove of
each other.) Your likeable personality and open-minded intelligence are the
draw.
Figure 6-3:

of Aquarius.

Chapter 6: Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius

The sorry side
Your unconventional, independent outlook can morph into eccentricity,
thoughtlessness, pointless rebellion, and strange hair. You can be contrary
and childish, a foot-stomping rebel who’s never willing to go along. As a fixed
sign, you tend to be stubborn, and it’s rare for you to give up a cherished
idea, no matter how outmoded it may become. And your famous humanity,
perhaps your finest trait, can seem false. You may strike people as distant
and aloof because you recoil from intimacy and even go out of your way to
erect barriers against it. For you, detachment is a natural state. More com-
fortable with ideas than with emotions, you can be warm on the surface but
chilly underneath. You’re a visitor to spaceship Earth — alert but uninvolved.
Although your idealism runs deep, and you truly want the best for yourself
and others, you don’t necessarily express these thoughts in a positive way.
Emotionally, you may strike people as peculiarly insensitive, even as they
strike you as bizarrely thin-skinned. The truth is that you just don’t get it. 
At your worst, I’m sorry to say, you’re an android.
And there’s another element to you that’s easily overlooked. Beneath the 
dazzling surface of your personality and your remarkable, inventive mind,
you can be stunningly insecure. Other people may not notice this (they may
think, instead, that you have an overinflated ego). In fact, your self-doubt
hampers you and is something to fight.
Relationships
Given that Aquarius is the sign of humanity, you might imagine that your rela-
tionships would be role models for the rest of the world. And in some ways,
they are. Fair and friendly, you’re interested in people from every corner of
society. You extend your friendship to oddballs, geniuses, extremists, and the
kid across the street. So what if you eventually drop most of these relation-
ships? You also maintain a few friendships for life.
Romance is more complicated. Although you pride yourself on your toler-
ance, certain established customs — getting engaged, for instance, or reserv-
ing Saturday night for your beloved —seem phony or old-fashioned to you.
You’re often astonished by the conventional expectations that people hold
dear, and you resent having to go along with those antiquated notions.
Trouble is, people misinterpret your independent ways as rejection — and,
yes, they take it personally. Those needy folks probably strike you as unrea-
sonable and demanding. See it that way if you wish. But remember: Intimate
relationships have their own rhythm, which sometimes requires you to offer
reassurance and to behave according to — please excuse the expression —
the rules. In maintaining a relationship, make sure that your assumptions are
shared.
74

For the lowdown on your relationships with other signs, flip to Chapter 15.
Work
Why would anyone want to follow the beaten path? Striking out for terra
incognita is much more entertaining. If you can create your own schedule,
you’re even better off. Late-night hours don’t scare you; mind-numbing tasks
and banal co-workers (a curse of your life) do. What matters most is that
your job is future-oriented and focused on change. That’s where you find the
most personal satisfaction. Fields that are a fit for Aquarius include social
work, politics, technology, science (and medicine in particular), academia,
environmentalism, civil rights, and anything that pushes the boundaries in a
progressive direction. Politicians like Abraham Lincoln, thinkers like Charles
Darwin, inventors like Thomas Edison, and TV personalities like Oprah
Winfrey demonstrate the impact that your sign can make. Innovative
Aquarius sees the future before anyone else and knows how to react to it.
Technology, by the way, is oxygen to your soul. Even if you think you don’t
like modern technology — maybe you’re an aficionado of vinyl or a collector
of portable typewriters — you still benefit from it.

In This Chapter
 Contemplating Cancer
 Observing Scorpio
 Pondering Pisces
I
have often wondered: If it were possible to choose my sign, what would I
want to be? Rams have tons of energy, but they can be clueless. Geminis
sparkle, but they try so hard, it’s exhausting to contemplate. Capricorns have
traits I wish I possessed, but they have a rough time loosening up. And so it
goes around the zodiac, each sign in turn presenting its attractions and its lia-
bilities. I don’t know what I’d pick.
I do know this: I wouldn’t choose to be a water sign. Don’t get me wrong: I
adore people who were born under water signs, and I treasure the (abun-
dant) water in my own chart. I also know that water represents emotion, and
those born under its influence tend to be swamped by their sentiments.
Profoundly sensitive, they’re vulnerable and reactive, first responders on the
most human front of all. They’re also hugely intuitive and occasionally psy-
chic with what some commentators have suggested is a deep spiritual bent.
But is it easy to be a water sign? All things being equal, I’d rather be a Leo.
The water signs, which are known for their emotional responsiveness,
include the following:
 Cancer the Crab (June 21 to July 22), the sign of cardinal water. Cancer is
famed for its emotional acuity, sympathetic nature, and love of home.
 Scorpio the Scorpion (October 23 to November 21), the sign of fixed
water. Scorpio is recognized for its intensity, magnetism, and ability to
burrow deep, both psychologically and intellectually.
 Pisces the Fish (February 19 to March 19), the sign of mutable water.
Ruled by elusive Neptune, Pisces is compassionate, impressionable,
gentle, and imaginative.

The water signs share an emotional sensitivity and a well-developed sense of
intuition. If water is your element, this chapter describes you. In these pages,
I present your most commendable traits and your most pitiful ones, along
with information about relationships and work.
In addition to its element, each sign is assigned a polarity (positive or nega-
tive) and a quality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). For more about these terms,
flip to Chapter 1. Also, don’t forget to check out Chapter 1 if you were born
on the cusp of any of these signs — meaning the first or last day.
Cancer the Crab: June 21–July 22
Ruled by the ever-changing Moon, you’re introspective, intuitive, security-
conscious, and exceedingly aware of your emotional environment. You’re also
determined to conquer your vulnerabilities and achieve your goals.
The glyph of Cancer (see Figure 7-1) represents the breasts (and hence the
mother), the claws of the crab, and the fluid nature of emotion.
The sunny side
You embody an intriguing paradox. Because you’re a water sign, you’re emo-
tionally wide open with an intense inner focus. Because you’re also a cardinal
sign, you’re enterprising and ambitious, with a strong outer focus. No wonder
you’re known for your fluctuating moods. Your emotional sensitivity is one of
your greatest assets. It serves as a barometer to the atmosphere around you,
and the more tuned into it you are, the better. You’re shrewd and insightful.
When you trust your intuition enough to act in accordance with it, you can
steer in any direction and navigate through the roughest storm.
You also maintain a strong tie to the past, both personal and historical, and
you have a powerful longing for home, family, domestic tranquility, and emo-
tional security. Loyal, affectionate, kind, and supportive, you never give up on
someone you love — and if that means clinging or being overprotective, so
be it. Your ability to nurture others parallels your need to care for and com-
fort yourself.
Figure 7-1:
The symbol
of Cancer
the Crab.
78
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

At the same time, you’re intent on initiating activity. Whatever your emotions
may be, you don’t let them stop you from setting far-reaching goals and res-
olutely going after them. Your determination is extraordinary. Despite your
doubts and insecurities, you forge ahead valiantly, though not without some
tears along the way. At your best, your internal awareness supports your
outer ambition, just as your knowledge of the past forms a sturdy foundation
for your forays into the future. The fact that you have the best memory on
the planet is yet another strength.
The sorry side
Picture the crab. Vulnerable and soft within its protective armor, it approaches
its target sideways and, when frightened, scuttles back into its shell. You do the
same. Fretful and high-strung, afraid of addressing a problem directly, you
defend yourself well — sometimes to your own detriment. At times you’re so
defensive, so imprisoned by your anxieties, that movement becomes impossi-
ble. You withdraw or enter a state of total denial, where you become unreach-
able. At your worst, your need for security paralyzes you.
Yet there’s no avoiding your powerful emotions, which can wash over you as
suddenly as a tidal wave. Those moments of sheer emotion are an indelible
part of who you are, and you don’t always deal with them well. With other
people, you can be stunningly possessive and demanding. Spurred by your
fear of being abandoned, you cling ferociously, holding on to relationships —
and jobs — way past their expiration dates.
Avoiding the quicksand of insecurity and the snake pit of depression are chal-
lenges you must confront; getting to the bottom of your deepest fears and
complicated psyche is another.
Relationships
As the most maternal sign in the zodiac, Cancer has an instinct for closeness
that few signs can equal. The family you were born into never ceases to play
a central role in your consciousness, whether positive or negative (or, more
likely, a confusing amalgamation of both). You lavish attention on friends and
lovers alike, and in the absence of a committed romantic partner, you turn
friends into family. Children claim a special place in your heart.
Love affairs absorb you, but you’re most comfortable in a committed, tradi-
tional relationship. Shyer than you appear to be, you long for someone with
whom you share a soul connection. When you feel cherished and recognized,
you’re utterly devoted and supportive. When you feel insecure, it’s another
matter. Fearful of being alone and yet unwilling to engage in conflict, you hold
on too tightly for too long. When a relationship falls apart, you’re devastated,
79
Chapter 7: Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces

even if you’re the one who made the decision. You withdraw into the safety of
your shell. Many tears are shed. And then — it’s amazing — you’re fine.
Although astrologers always say that the Crab moves sideways (and I’ve said
it myself), it’s not always true. Sometimes you move forward with giant
strides. I have seen Cancer soar from abject misery to honeymoon cruise
within a matter of months. In romance, as in other areas, your ability to take
action and to recognize opportunities pays off.
For more on your relationships with other signs, turn to Chapter 15.
Work
It’s true that yours is the sign of domesticity. That doesn’t mean you want to
stay home all the time making tea and crumpets. As a cardinal sign, you’re
happiest when you’re actively involved in the world. You shine in fields that
rely on your emotional sensitivity. You excel in medicine, teaching, social
work, child psychology, marriage counseling, and any other form of therapy.
Because you have a deep love of home (and house), you can also succeed at
real estate, architecture, cooking, restaurant management, and so on. Finally,
thanks to your interest in the past, you’re drawn to history, antiques, and
museum work. You’re great with children. You’re also supremely responsive
to the elderly and would do well in geriatrics. Whatever you do, it must offer
fulfillment as well as material security. Your occupation needs to captivate
you, and there’s no reason to settle for anything less.
Despite your doubts and hesitations, taking the initiative is your best move.
Within an organization, you quickly form alliances and generally rise to a posi-
tion of leadership. You’re well-organized and energetic, but you also become
emotionally involved in your work, and you tend to take it home with you. It
helps to find a mentor. Establishing a personal tie with someone who has the
authority and expertise you lack can fortify and reassure you. Similarly, after
you have accumulated some experience, you find it gratifying to become a
mentor.
If you work with or for a Cancerian, be prepared to give your all. Crabs try to
create family, even at the office. They want to forge strong connections and
therefore try to create a positive atmosphere. At least in theory, the office
door will be open, and criticism will be constructive. If you need help, say so.
(They tend to slip into a parental role.) If you have a legitimate complaint,
address it in a private meeting. But don’t sneak around complaining to one
and all behind your boss’s back. Cancerians may hide their emotions, but
they’re astute enough to sense betrayal.

The sunny side
Vibrant, magnetic, and passionate, you’re a person of depth and complexity
who participates in life fully. You’re perceptive and sensual, and your senses
are alert. So are your powers of observation. As a Scorpio, you’re aware of the
spoken message as well as the subtext and the body language, and you can’t
help relishing the melodrama of it all. Your insights into human psychology
are discerning, in part because you have such a wide range of experience.
Your mood seesaws between ecstatic heights and nightmarish depths, and
there’s hardly an emotion that you haven’t felt right down to your soul. You’re
also curious about other people. Although you value your privacy and are
often quite reticent, you’re skilled at ferreting out the secrets of others.
Mysteries fascinate you, which is why astrology books inevitably recommend
that Scorpios become detectives or spies.
Here’s another positive trait: You’re determined. When you apply yourself,
your willpower is astonishing (although you can also take it too far: Eating
disorders are a blight on your sign). You’re resourceful, too. You make careful
plans, and if the time’s not right, you wait. You don’t ever give up. You aim for
the highest — or the lowest. That’s why, unlike any other sign, Scorpio has
three symbols: the scorpion, which crawls through the dust; the eagle, which
soars through the air; and the phoenix, which burns itself up in the heat of its
passion and is reborn. Like that mythical bird, you have the ability to rejuve-
nate yourself.
The sorry side
Let me be honest: Scorpio has some deeply nasty traits. You can be obses-
sive, jealous, secretive, manipulative, and arrogant. You have an exceedingly
wicked tongue. You know how to wound, and if you’re backed into a corner,
you don’t hesitate to do so. Once you decide that you’ve been crossed,
you’re unforgiving. You can be vengeful, spiteful, and disturbingly cold-
hearted — or so it appears. When Scorpio (sign of Charles Manson) is bad,
it’s downright scary.
But in my experience, most Scorpions keep that side of their personalities
under wraps. Instead, you struggle with depression. When times are tough,
you plummet to the bottom of the sea. Other signs don’t begin to comprehend
the bleak despair that pulls you down. Yet this is an essential component of
Figure 7-2:

Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

being a Scorpio. It works like this: You sink into darkness, claw your way
through the underworld of the psyche, and wrestle with your own worst quali-
ties and darkest fears. And then you emerge. Before Pluto was discovered in
1930, astrologers regarded Mars, the planet of war (and desire), as the ruler of
Scorpio. And indeed, you pursue your demons like a warrior, fighting relent-
lessly, even against addiction and other tribulations. In your quest for renewal
and transformation, you’re unflinching.
Relationships
No one said relationships were easy. That’s because casual liaisons don’t sat-
isfy you. Even your friendships are serious. Growing up, you understood the
concept of blood brothers or sisters (even if you never found a friend who
qualified), and you longed for that kind of connection. As an adult, you still
want to bond on the deepest of levels. That’s especially true in your romantic
life. Ardent, mysterious, and magnetic, you long for blazing sex, conversation
that breaks all barriers, and total immersion. When you fall in love, it’s the-
atrical and impassioned — a drama for the ages.
At its finest, that intensity helps you create the kind of fully intertwined part-
nership you crave. At its worst, it causes you to become suspicious, posses-
sive, and resentful. Issues of power and control arise, and you can become
painfully obsessive. When you feel injured or when a relationship is disinte-
grating, you unleash the deadly sting for which the scorpion is famous. If you
cut someone off, it’s forever. No one feels ecstasy the way you do; and no one
suffers more.
Finally, I want to point out that, despite your desire to mind-meld with
another human being, Scorpio also requires privacy. Without it, your peace of
mind unravels, and anyone involved with you must understand that. Solitude,
like sex, is a necessity.
Wondering how you get along with other signs? Turn to Chapter 15.
Work
Scorpio brings energy and ambition to the workplace, and your goals are gen-
erally of the highest order (though, for the record, I must acknowledge that
Scorpios can also be adept as scam artists, drug dealers, and low-level
thugs). Astute and insightful, you make a fantastic advocate for anyone in
need. Plus, you’re a fighter. You’re also fascinated by power and money,
which gives you the motivation to excel at business (think of Bill Gates) or
politics (consider Hillary Clinton). Whatever field you find yourself in, triviali-
ties don’t interest you. Nor do you have to be center stage (unless, of course,
you have a lot of Leo in your chart). But you do need to be involved in an
83
Chapter 7: Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces

enterprise that matters. Scientific research, surgery, various kinds of counsel-
ing, community organizing, investigative reporting, investment banking, poli-
tics, and various aspects of psychology all come to mind. As I noted earlier,
detective and spy are two positions traditionally considered Scorpionic. But
did I mention mortician? Magician? Obituary writer? Mystery writer? Guru?
Poet? Greatest artist of the 20th century (Picasso)? The list goes on and on.
If you work with or for a Scorpio, you’ll see what it means to be committed.
Industrious, disciplined, and demanding, Scorpios know how to concentrate
(unless, of course, they can’t, in which case, you get to see the miserable, sulky
Scorpio). Because they know how to keep a secret, you can trust Scorpios with
yours. But they’re also inscrutable. They nurture their accomplices — and
demolish their enemies. If you have a Scorpio boss, do your best — and don’t
try any fancy stuff. She’ll see it coming, and you’ll pay for your presumption.
No one, and I mean no one, wants to have a Scorpio for an enemy.

Pisces the Fish: February 19–March 19
Yours is the sign of dreams, imagination, poetry, and matters of the spirit.
Ruled by mysterious Neptune, the planet of glamour and illusion, your chal-
lenge is to find a way to live in a workaday world when you have an out-of-
this-world sensibility.
The glyph of Pisces (see Figure 7-3) connotes two forms of experience, inter-
nal and external. Alternatively, it represents two fish tied together. When they
cooperate, they navigate their watery domain with ease. When they pull in
opposite directions, neither gets anywhere.
The sunny side
You want sensitive? Pisces is sensitive. Every tiny bounce in the emotional
weather sends your internal compass into a spin. Sympathetic and receptive,
you receive a constant barrage of impressions and information, and you can
be weirdly psychic. But protecting yourself is difficult because you lack
boundaries. All your membranes are permeable. When the people upstairs
have a fight, you feel battered. When bad things happen to good people,
you’re horrified. And when good things happen to people you love, you
rejoice. (It’s one of your most magnificent traits.) You’re generous, big-
hearted, insightful, and truly compassionate. You’re also innately spiritual.
Another strength is your powerful imagination. Your dreams (and day-
dreams) can be a vivid source of inspiration and even problem-solving. Your
intuition is equally powerful. You sense what’s going on way before it regis-
ters on the seismograph. But you can also become trapped in a web of illu-
sion (see the upcoming section, “The sorry side”). At your intuitive best,
your refusal to get hung up on the limitations of reality enables you to leap
over obstacles and to make surprising breakthroughs and turnarounds.
Unlike more “realistic” signs, you embrace change and are willing to take
enormous risks. Often your gambles succeed. When they don’t, you’re philo-
sophical about it. As Albert Einstein, a prototypical Pisces, said, “A person
who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”

The sorry side
At your out-to-lunch worst, you’re gullible in the extreme, irrational, and so
easily hurt that you’re practically an open wound. Because the requirements
of ordinary life can overwhelm you, you’re prone to wishful thinking and out-
right fantasy, often combined with a sense of entitlement that boggles the
mind. Indecisive and weak, you’re readily deceived.
But that’s not the most serious problem. More often, you delude yourself by
simply refusing to accept reality. Your grasp of reality is tenuous at best, and
you often refuse to accept even a little responsibility for your situation. Even
when you’re miserable, your passivity can bypass all reason. Instead of taking
action when you’re feeling trapped, you wait to be rescued, often sinking into
a melancholy pattern of brooding and procrastination. (I’ve seen men do this
as well as women, by the way.) Moreover, when your efforts come to nothing
or your dreams are thwarted, you tend to be overcome by lethargy, self-pity,
depression, guilt, or resentment. Sleep — too little or, more commonly, too
much — can defeat your most heartfelt resolutions. And did I mention sub-
stance abuse? Let’s just say that you’re susceptible. More than most, you’re
your own worst enemy. And, more than most, you have the capacity to turn
your circumstances (and your attitude) around.
Relationships
A faithful, generous friend, a whimsical, starry-eyed lover, and a tender spouse,
you have a certain sweetness that can’t be denied, and your ability to love is
without equal. You see the best in those you care for, even when they don’t see
it themselves, and you delight in cheering them on, in part because you crave
that kind of encouragement yourself.
A genuine romantic, you yearn to be swept away — and supported — in
true Hollywood style. You’re also capable of falling for a homeless bum just
because you sense the potential beneath the plastic poncho. Friends may
object. But once your feelings are engaged, your ability to make rational
judgments evaporates like mist. As you wander around in the fog of infatuation,
totally lost, you spin a fantasy that enables you to ignore unmistakable flaws
(alcoholism and infidelity, say). It’s a strange phenomenon: You’re supremely
responsive to other people. In many situations, your intuition is flawless. Yet at
other times, you suffer from a dangerous Piscean malady: a deep-seated, willful
refusal to face reality. For Pisces, seeing clearly is always a worthy goal.
For a glance at your relationships with other signs, turn to Chapter 15.
86
Part II: Here Comes the Sun 

Work
In Utopia, these are a few of the jobs that Pisces would happily hold: poet,
artist, musician, clairvoyant, palm reader, sailor, filmmaker, actor, wine taster,
spiritual healer, hypnotist, yoga teacher — and anything concerning tropical
fish, the ocean, or ballet.
Given those career choices, you may expect Pisces to be a failure in the real
world. But you’d be wrong. It turns out that Pisces is strangely adept at han-
dling enormous sums of money. According to a 1995 study done by Forbes
Magazine, more of the 400 richest Americans are Pisceans than any other sign.
Why would that be? Well, you really do have a creative mind. It’s not just a
matter of coloring outside the lines; you have the ability to toss the book aside
and design something completely original. Plus, unlike more realistic signs
(Capricorn, for example), you dream big. If you can harness that vision to an
old-fashioned work ethic, you can accomplish anything. If your job also bene-
fits humanity, you’ll be even happier. Pisces aspires to be of service, and you’ll
feel better about yourself if you are. That’s why, besides the utopian trades in
the previous paragraph, you may want to consider medicine, social work, phil-
anthropy, education, environmentalism, cuisine, oceanography, and — yes —
finance.
If you work with or for a Pisces, stay tuned — and I mean every minute. Any
bad vibes you detect, Pisces notices too. Sympathetic and broad-minded,
Pisceans support their staff and don’t get stuck on minor points. But they’re
strivers, both more opportunistic and less secure than they may appear. If a
Piscean senses dissension in the ranks or anything less than total loyalty,
you’ll be fish food.

Your horoscope with its mysterious symbols, concen-
tric circles, and tiny numbers may look like a magi-
cian’s amulet. In fact, it’s simply a map of the heavens at
the moment of your birth. That celestial pattern, formed
by the planets and not to be repeated for roughly 26,000
years, encapsulates the cosmic forces operating at the time
of your birth. Every object in your horoscope reflects or
symbolizes an aspect of who you are.
In this part, you discover the meaning of the Moon, the
Ascendant, and the planets in your chart, both by sign
and by house. You can also read about the ways that the
planets interact. And finally, in Chapter 14, you put those
cosmic ingredients together into an interpretation. Once
you do that, you’re cooking.

trange but true: To an Earthling gazing at the sky, the Sun and Moon
appear to be the same size. The irrefutable evidence of science states
otherwise. But visually, the two are equal. Ancient mythologies shared that
perception, associating the Sun and Moon with quarreling lovers, siblings, or
deities.
Astrologers picture the Sun and the Moon as partners. The unvarying Sun
represents your basic essence, vitality, and conscious self, while the incon-
stant Moon with its many phases (and occasional disappearances) signifies
your emotional reactions, instincts, habits, and unconscious.
If the Sun and Moon occupied compatible signs at your birth, you’re in luck.
Your (solar) will and (lunar) emotions, your conscious awareness and uncon-
scious, moony self, are in sync. That must be nice — I wouldn’t know. If your
luminaries inhabit clashing signs, you’ll experience a storm of conflicting
needs and desires. Well, that’s life. Astrology just reflects it.
To discover the Moon’s position in your chart, turn to the Appendix. But
remember: The Moon swings into a new sign every two or three days. If it
moved from one sign to the next on your birthday, you may have to do a bit
of calculation to find out exactly where it was at the crucial moment.
The Moon, which shines by the light of the Sun, is symbolized by the cres-
cent of receptivity (see Figure 8-1). To determine its placement in your horo-
scope, you need an accurate chart. To get one, I recommend going to the
Internet (see Chapter 2 for specific advice). You could also do precise mathe-
matical calculations, call an astrologer, or invest in astrological software. For
a description of the Moon in the houses, go to Chapter 12.

The Moon in the Signs
The sign that the Moon occupied at your birth describes your emotional
reactions. It defines an area of fluctuation and instability in your chart, and it
also represents women in general and your mother in particular. In this list, I
describe the effect of the Moon in the signs:
 Moon in Aries: Instinctive and spontaneous, you form judgments
instantly. Your enthusiasm is easily aroused, as is your anger. You may
come across as self-absorbed because you’re more insecure than you let
on, and you’re often remarkably competitive. You’re feisty and decisive
(sometimes foolishly so). You can also be selfish, irritable, impatient,
and blunt. Quick-tempered and impetuous, you make sure your needs
are acknowledged at the earliest possible moment. The chances are
that, when you were a child, your mother reacted promptly to your insis-
tent, fiery demands. She had no choice. As a result, you got what you
wanted — and you learned to be independent, direct, and courageous.
 Moon in Taurus: You yearn for security, emotional and material, and you
do everything you can to achieve it. Stable and stubborn, you approach
change cautiously because nothing makes you more uncomfortable. But
once you understand that change is inevitable, you do what you have to
do. Trustworthy and congenial, you’re charming, attractive, warm, faith-
ful, and possessive. As a child, you desperately needed the security that
comes from having loving, reliable parents. You still crave the pleasures
of predictability and security.
 Moon in Gemini: You’re flighty, friendly, dashing, and articulate. You
express yourself with wit and intelligence, even if you strike people as
glib or superficial. Nervous and high-strung, you take an essentially
mental approach to matters of the heart. Although you may panic in the
heat of a crisis, that reaction is a fleeting one. After the feathers settle,
you look around objectively and analyze your own reactions, a process
that brings you a measure of calm. As a child, you were restless, curious,
and easily distracted. During stressful moments, your mother found it
easy to divert you. Diversion still strikes you as a reasonable — or at
least an understandable — strategy during hard times. A first-rate ratio-
nalizer, you don’t hesitate to move on when the time is right.

Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Moon in Cancer: The Moon rules the sign of the Crab, so no matter what
else is happening in your chart, you’re a lunar person: moody, receptive,
sentimental, vulnerable, and supremely aware of the continual flux of
emotions. Tears spring from your eyes with little provocation, and you
occasionally need to withdraw to soothe your surging feelings. Caring
and protective, you’re a truly kind person but, like people born with the
Moon in Taurus, you have a rough time letting go. As a child, you were
extraordinarily responsive to your mother. Her impact on you surpasses
the norm, which is why, when you have children, you’re likely to be an
exceptionally loving, occasionally overinvolved parent.
 Moon in Leo: A Leo moon adds warmth, dazzle, and exuberance to any
Sun sign. Generous, devoted, and lively, you love to laugh and are gifted
with presence and joie de vivre. Although your considerable pride is
easily injured (especially if you think you’ve been ignored), you’re usu-
ally confident and upbeat. One way or another, you love to perform, and
the world loves to respond. But when things are going badly or when
you feel downhearted or insecure, you cover up your doubts and
ambivalence with emotional fireworks. You picked up this dramatic pat-
tern from your mother, who was somewhat of a drama queen herself.
She taught you to seek recognition, and she gave you the confidence to
set ambitious goals.
 Moon in Virgo: Emotionally timid and unobtrusive, you’d rather repress
your emotions than articulate them. You find it difficult to confront seri-
ous issues. Instead, you distract yourself with minutiae or by working so
hard you barely have a chance to breathe. You’re industrious and practi-
cal. You’re also fussy and hard to please. Without a doubt, you’re your

Mary Beth Whitehead
Mary Beth Whitehead, one of the first surrogate
mothers, was born April 7, 1957, with all the pio-
neering spirit you might expect of an Aries.
Thanks to her bold Aries Sun and the detached,
unconventional attitudes of her Aquarian
Ascendant, she agreed to become the surro-
gate mother for William and Elizabeth Stern, a
couple who were unable to have a child. Mary
Beth, who has the Moon in Cancer in the fifth
house of children, was glad to help. But after
she had the baby, her maternal, Cancerian
Moon kicked in — and suddenly the plan didn’t
seem like such a smart idea. Sensing a deep
connection to the child she had agreed to give
up, she stubbornly refused to relinquish her.
Only when a judge ordered her to do so did she
finally give the baby girl (also an Aries) to the
Sterns. Had she spoken to an astrologer first,
she might never have agreed to the deal in the
first place.

own harshest critic. Where does this reprehensible quality come from?
You guessed it — your mother (or whoever played that role in your life).
Although her criticism, implicit or explicit, made an impact on you, she
also deserves credit for several of your virtues, including the willingness
to shoulder responsibility, the values you place on efficiency and organi-
zation, and your altruistic desire to relieve the suffering of others. You
may be inhibited, but that doesn’t mean you’re blind.
 Moon in Libra: You’re gracious, romantic, and artistic. You shun vulgar-
ity, value courtesy and elegance, and try to convey your feelings in a
calm, diplomatic manner. Peace is essential to you, and you will do any-
thing to maintain balance. As a child, you learned to maintain appear-
ances, even if you were abused. Your even temper drew praise, and
people came to expect it of you. Now, as an adult, you seem unflappable.
Love and relationships are fundamental to your well-being. If you’re
single, you feel bereft without a partner; if you’re mated, you can
scarcely imagine any other scenario and may be fearful of being alone.
Either way, you detest confrontation and therefore may gloss over prob-
lems. Not surprisingly, distressing issues may remain unresolved for
years on end; your desire for peace and harmony trumps everything.
 Moon in Scorpio: Passionate and easily injured, you’re one complicated
puppy. Willful, intense, and occasionally self-destructive, your emotions —
to quote Herman Melville — rush like “herds of walruses and whales”
beneath the surface of your personality. Hesitant to reveal the depth of
your emotions, you try to keep them hidden, a task that may require a cer-
tain degree of dissembling and manipulation. Not that you mean to be
controlling — you just can’t help it. Covering up your feelings is some-
thing you learned in childhood. Even if your childhood looked enviable
from afar, you were afraid of abandonment or rejection and were well
aware of the suppressed needs and subterranean conflicts within your
family. You learned to keep quiet about your own concerns. Your silence is
a form of protection — and hiding. Although some people with this place-
ment nurse fantasies of retaliation for long-ago wrongs, most simply con-
tinue to hide their feelings. Those walruses and whales may still be down
there, but the surface looks smooth.
 Moon in Sagittarius: You’re philosophical, outspoken, cheerful, uninhib-
ited, well-intentioned, unrealistic on occasion, and idealistic — some-
times pathetically so. Your optimism runs deep, and as a result, you’re a
risk-taker, always prepared to gallop off on an adventure or to commit
yourself to causes other people deem hopeless. Intellectually and emo-
tionally, you cherish your independence above all else. Lengthy relation-
ship discussions make you squirm. More comfortable with action than
with analysis, you can be self-righteous and inadvertently hurtful, and
you tend to justify your own misdeeds without blinking. Yet you mean
well. And people sense that about you. Even as a child, whenever you
radiated good cheer, your mother responded positively. To encourage
that sort of reaction, you convey your enthusiasm more readily than
your pain and, like her, you shrink from emotional displays.
94
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Moon in Capricorn: You’re steady, reserved, self-reliant, ambitious, and
well-disciplined. Even when you were small, you were serious, and the
playfulness of childhood may have eluded you. Now, ever the realist,
you recognize both your strengths and your limitations. Among your
limitations, you suspect, is the inability to have fun. You have a ten-
dency to descend into depression and pessimism from time to time, per-
haps because your mother suffered from a case of postpartum blues.
Sensing her gloom, you pulled back. You’re emotionally reserved and
self-conscious, especially in the face of other people’s melodramatic out-
bursts. You can’t bear those scenes. Success steadies you. You’re willing
to shoulder broad responsibilities because you feel more grounded, as
well as more powerful and peaceful, when you have authority.
Somebody’s got to take control. It may as well be you.
 Moon in Aquarius: In your mind’s eye, you’re out to improve the world.
With your progressive instincts and sympathy for others, you have the
ability to alter lives for the better. You also have a gift for friendship. But
at a certain point, you disappear behind the curtains because deep in
your heart, you have an antipathy for intimacy. You shy away from close-
ness and are drawn instead to offbeat people, unconventional activities,
and the world of the intellect. Thank your mom. Even if your early years
were marked by turmoil, she encouraged you to express your individual-
ity and to use your intelligence. She was less comfortable with your
emotional needs. You’re the same way. You find it taxing to delve into
your emotions — or even to recognize them. So you pretend they aren’t
there — and this technique works . . . at least for a while.
 Moon in Pisces: You’re gentle, sentimental, sympathetic, and ultrasensi-
tive. Easily wounded and often shy, you feel like a hostage to your own
emotions, which are difficult to control or conceal. Other people sup-
press their vulnerabilities — you’re all too conscious of yours. You’re
equally sensitive to your instincts, hunches, and fantasies. At your
impressionable best, you’re virtually psychic. You’re also artistically (or
musically) talented. But you can be gullible, hopelessly unrealistic, and
self-indulgent. And you have trouble standing up for yourself. Being kind
to others is often easier than helping yourself. This goes back to child-
hood. Ever alert to your mother’s shifting moods, you learned to do
what you could to improve the emotional atmosphere — even if that
meant disregarding your own needs. Your continuing challenge is to be
as compassionate to yourself as you are to others.
The Nodes of the Moon
Among astrologers in India, the Nodes of the Moon are considered a vital part
of every horoscope, as necessary as the Sun and just as influential. But when
I began to study astrology, my teachers barely mentioned the Nodes of the
Moon. Even now, introductory astrology books often omit them. One reason
95
Chapter 8: Moon Signs: The Lunacy Factor

is that even though the Nodes of the Moon occupy two sensitive degrees in
your birth chart, there’s no celestial body at either spot. In a strictly physical
sense, the Nodes of the Moon don’t exist. As Gertrude Stein said in a different
context, “There’s no there there.” Nevertheless, the Nodes of the Moon have
a long and splendid astrological history.
The Nodes of the Moon are the points where the Moon, in its orbit around the
Earth, crosses the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun across the sky.
The spot where the Moon climbs over the ecliptic is the North Node; the point
where it sinks below the ecliptic is the South Node. The Nodes, which are
exactly 180° apart, gradually shift backwards, spending about a year and
a half in each sign and progressing through the zodiac in about 19 years.
To ancient astrologers, the North Node (or Dragon’s Head) was beneficial,
allied with prosperity and luck, while the South Node (or Dragon’s Tail) was
Saturnian in flavor, a point of loss or adversity. Well into the 20th century,
astrologers still occasionally described the South Node as evil — a distress-
ing comment to anyone with the South Node in a prominent position.
Practitioners of Western astrology generally agree that the North Node illumi-
nates your spiritual path and the constructive yet demanding choices that
promote growth. For those who believe in reincarnation, the North Node sig-
nifies your path in this life — an evolutionary journey for which you may feel
unprepared because it’s a trip into the unknown. In contrast, the South Node
supports habit over effort, stagnation over growth, and experience over
exploration. It’s your default method. It feels right because you’ve traveled
that road before, perhaps in earlier lives.
I admit that the South Node’s reputation isn’t good. Neither is it completely
negative. It represents a set of talents and skills you’ve already mastered. The
danger lies not in using those qualities but in placing undue emphasis on
them and thus distorting them. The South Node is your launching pad; the
North Node is your destination.
The North Node (see the left-hand image in Figure 8-2) is a point of expan-
sion, potential, and growth. Among Vedic astrologers, it is called Rahu. The
South Node (see the right-hand image in Figure 8-2), known to Vedic astrologers
as Ketu, symbolizes deeply entrenched patterns and habits that no longer
profit you.
To figure out the position of the Lunar Nodes, turn to the Appendix and look
up the year of your birth. The essential fact to remember about this table is
that it tells you only the position of the North Node. You have to figure out
the position of the South Node, which should take about one second.

As an example, say you were born in 1978. That year, according to the table,
the North Node, spinning in a retrograde direction (that’s what the R means)
slipped into Virgo on July 5 at 5:41 a.m., eastern standard time. If you were
born after that, your North Node is in Virgo. To figure out what sign the North
Node was in prior to that, you need to check out the previous entry. In this
case, it was January 7, 1977, when the North Node entered Libra. It remained
there until July 5, 1978. So if you were born in 1977 between January 1 and
July 5 (at 5:41 a.m.), your North Node is in Libra.
Notice, too, that the North Node is usually retrograde. As a result, it travels
through the signs in the reverse direction, going from Libra in 1977 to Virgo in
1978, and eventually to Aries in 1986.
Once you know where your North Node is, you can quickly locate your South
Node because it’s always in the opposite sign, exactly 180° away. To wit:

The Nodes in the Signs
The Sun, the Moon, and the planets are substantial, massive objects. Whether
they’re solid and rocky like the Moon and Mars, or gas giants like Jupiter
and Neptune, they’re distinct, visible worlds with their own geography and

Chapter 8: Moon Signs: The Lunacy Factor

their own chemistry. This isn’t so of the Nodes. The Nodes are mathematical
points — not places. They lack features of any kind. Nonetheless, they carry
meaning.
The North Node and the South Node are a matched pair, equal but opposite.
They inhabit opposite signs and opposite houses. (For information on the
Nodes in the houses, turn to Chapter 12.)
The following list identifies the areas of growth and stagnation marked by the
North and South Nodes of the Moon:
 North Node in Aries/South Node in Libra: You yearn to move in the
Aries direction, toward assertiveness, self-sufficiency, and bold action.
When you obey your impulses and act independently, you flourish. But
all too often, instead of mustering up the courage you need, you give
your power away to others. You may fear that if you assert yourself fully,
you’ll never find the relationship you want (or you’ll destroy the relation-
ship you have). On the contrary: Submerging your identity in another
person is a mistake. Ultimately, the more independent you are, the more
contented you will be, whether you’re in a relationship or not.
 North Node in Taurus/South Node in Scorpio: Sex, lies, manipulation,
and other people’s money fascinate you, as do the churning melodramas
and intense relationships you often attract. Trouble is, after a while,
those soap operas start to go stale. Rather than continuing to immerse
yourself in the sturm und drang of your obsessions, you gain from build-
ing a secure base for yourself. Your best moves are to gather the mater-
ial resources you need (however slowly), to cultivate patience, and to let
your most cherished values be your guide. What you need above all is
self-worth. And it wouldn’t hurt you to learn to manage money.
 North Node in Gemini/South Node in Sagittarius: How delightful to sit
around theorizing about life, death, and the meaning of existence. How
nice to know it all. And what a pleasure to convey your brilliant thoughts
to your grateful audience (or, in any case, to your beleaguered friends
and family). Sadly, it’s also a waste of energy. With your unstoppable
curiosity and ability to communicate, you benefit from accumulating
information and employing it for useful purposes. You’re a journalist, an
artist, a teacher — a clear thinker, yes, but get the facts. Leave those
philosophical musings on the conundrums of life to others. You have too
much to do in the here and now.
 North Node in Cancer/South Node in Capricorn: Ambitious and con-
trolling, you readily accept responsibility because you’re intent on
achieving respect and gaining a position in society. Yet that’s not where
your greatest joy lies. Despite your thirst for authority and status, you
have a more compelling need for home, family, and emotional security.
Although revealing your hopes and fears may cause you to feel distress-
ingly weak, the key to your evolution rests in your ability to trust and to
act in a caring fashion.
98
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 North Node in Leo/South Node in Aquarius: Many problems need to be
addressed these days, and you’d like to do your part. You’d be delighted
to devote yourself to an organization with a noble purpose — at least
you think you would be. In fact, though, your fulfillment lies elsewhere.
To be the person you were meant to be, you must risk expressing your
desires, no matter how selfish that may seem. As admirable as it seems,
quietly striving for peace on Earth won’t bring you happiness. The issue
is simple: You don’t want to be an anonymous part of a crowd. You need
an outlet for self-expression and you need to be acclaimed for what you
are, quirks and all.
 North Node in Virgo/South Node in Pisces: The realm of the spirit has
an irresistible pull for you. But immersing yourself in that world can feed
your escapist tendencies. You’re better off putting away your Ouija
board and attending to the routine details that vex us all, as boring as
they may seem. Your need to be a victim or a martyr (the two can be
indistinguishable) is chilling, and your sense of inferiority limits your
possibilities. Your path to fulfillment runs straight through the workaday
world of getting organized, returning phone calls, taking care of busi-
ness, and being conscious of the needs of others. You don’t need to sac-
rifice yourself. You just need to focus. Pay attention to the small stuff,
and you’ll be amazed at how contented you will feel.
 North Node in Libra/South Node in Aries: You’re courageous, daring,
and self-reliant. You’re comfortable asserting yourself (even if you do
have a temper), and you’re an effective leader and decision-maker. But
you’re also self-centered, and the advantages of a loving partnership
may elude you. Your challenge is to cooperate, be supportive, and mind
the needs of others (listening is key). By balancing their needs with your
own, you move in the direction of inner peace and contentment.
 North Node in Scorpio/South Node in Taurus: You think of yourself as a
practical person who allocates your resources, financial and otherwise,
with care. You believe that material security provides the foundation for
psychological strength. You can keep that fantasy if you wish, but you
should know that your deepest fulfillment has little to do with material
possessions or sensual pleasures, much as you appreciate them.
Instead, you benefit from digging into your psyche, sharing your secrets,
and dredging up the courage to overcome your resistance to change. In
truth, you crave nothing short of total metamorphosis. By getting
involved with others and learning to accept their input, you can, at mini-
mum, begin that process.
 North Node in Sagittarius/South Node in Gemini: It’s easy for you to
stumble into a life of trivial pursuits or to get lost in a labyrinth of per-
sonal gossip, rumor-mongering Web sites, and a never-ending supply of
celebrity scandals. But just as Brad Pitt is not your boyfriend (e-mail me
if I’m wrong), the path of supermarket tabloids (and other time wasters)
is not right for you. With your North Node in the sign of religion, law,
99
Chapter 8: Moon Signs: The Lunacy Factor

travel, and education, you need to get your mind around the big picture.
Seek knowledge. Learn a language. Look for a philosophy that aids your
understanding. On antique maps, areas of unexplored territory were
decorated with images of dragons, which were meant to warn travelers
away. You need to sail into those unknown waters, dragons and all.
Exercise helps. Spending time in nature is also valuable. Above all, you
need to trust your intuition and step into the world. That’s where you
can find the balm you need the most: adventure.
 North Node in Capricorn/South Node in Cancer: You have a streak of
domesticity, an interest in the past, and a lively appreciation for the
simple pleasures of home and family. Alas, as lovely as that sounds, it’s
not your path. Instead, you require real-world achievements, the kind
that are born in ambition, shaped through self-discipline, and rewarded
with money and prestige. Much as you adore your home and family, you
won’t gain much satisfaction sitting in the parlor. And although your
shifting moods may distract and disturb you, you still need to exercise
your talents — despite your fears and insecurities. You have the ability
to achieve your goals and to influence the wider community. Knowing
that the fates are with you may boost your confidence and help you rec-
ognize opportunities.
 North Node in Aquarius/South Node in Leo: Creative self-expression
comes easily to you, and you attract the kind of notice that most people
never get. You know what you want and you have the drive to get it. But
you’re inclined to take over, and you overwhelm people with the force of
your personality. For true growth, you need to team up with others and
broaden your vision. Getting involved in a societal cause is a wonderful
step for you. By attaching your urge for self-expression to a cause that’s
larger than yourself, you transcend your ego and move in the direction
of fulfillment.
 North Node in Pisces/South Node in Virgo: Work we must: That’s your
motto. You have a legion of responsibilities, and you get so caught up in
those dreary tasks that there’s room for nothing else. To combat anxiety,
you do your best to maintain order and to repel the encroaching forces
of chaos. But there’s only so much you can do. You certainly can’t allow
yourself to drift. And yet, drift you must. By letting your mind wander,
by putting aside your dreaded to-do list, and by being alert to your
dreams and fantasies, you allow yourself to glimpse another aspect of
experience and to explore the province of the spirit. Yoga, meditation,
and anything that can help you relax are indispensable tools. Your ulti-
mate goal is enlightenment.

Chapter 9
The Personal Planets
In This Chapter
 Contemplating the personal planets in astronomy, mythology, and astrology
 Understanding the planets in the signs
 Interpreting Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in your chart
T
he Sun and the Moon carry masses of information. All by themselves, they
provide a skeleton key to your psyche. But to fully grasp the complexity of
your own horoscope, you need to include the planets.
To ancient astrologers, that meant noting the positions of Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — the only planets visible from Earth. For thousands
of years, stargazers assumed that there were no other planets. Then, in 1781,
an amateur astronomer in England discovered another planet, and the race
was on. Today, astronomers argue over how many planets there are in the
solar system. Some claim there are only eight. Others insist there are 23 —
and counting. The answer depends entirely on whom you ask.
Astrologers regard those five planets, the ones you can see for yourself in the
night sky (and sometimes during the day), as the ones with the most immedi-
ate impact on the individual. That’s why Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn are known as the personal planets. The outer planets, which aren’t visi-
ble without a telescope, are less personality-driven and more generational in
their effects (with exceptions that I note in Chapter 10).
Locating Your Planets
If you’ve slogged your way through Chapters 2 and 3, you probably have a
copy of your chart in hand, in which case you already know your planetary
placements. If you don’t have a copy of your chart, return to those chapters —

Chapter 2 if you want to get your chart from the Internet or Chapter 3 and the
Appendix if you plan to cobble it together yourself using the tables in this
book.
To figure out what those placements mean, list your planets by sign and by
house and then look them up in this chapter (for the personal planets),
Chapter 10 (for the outer planets), and Chapter 12 (for the house placements).
Each planet performs a different function in your horoscope. To clarify the
distinctions between them, bear in mind that each planet has at least one
keyword that summarizes its meaning. Table 9-1 lists the keywords, along
with the mysterious little symbols that represent the planets.
At first, the information you find may seem random. After a while, certain
ideas will repeat themselves, and a coherent picture of your own possibilities
will start to emerge.

Don’t worry if you notice occasional contradictions as you look up your plan-
etary placements: They’re inevitable. As Walt Whitman said, “Do I contradict
myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)”
Concentrate instead on the ideas that pop up again and again. Once you iden-
tify those themes, you’re on your way to being an astrologer.
102
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Mercury: Communicating with Style
Astrologers get their understanding of the planets from many sources, includ-
ing science, mythology, and the astrological tradition.
In astronomy, the little planet Mercury is distinguished by its rapid pace — it
whirls around the Sun in a mere 88 days — and its proximity to the Sun.
In mythology, the Roman god Mercury, known to the Greeks as Hermes, is
also recognized for his speed. In his winged sandals and cap, he was the mes-
senger of the gods as well as a thief, musician, trickster, and accomplished
liar who could talk his way out of anything. A master of spin, Hermes
escorted dead souls into the underworld. The ancients worshipped him as
the god of travel, speech, roads, boundaries, sleep, dream, and the nameless
places that fall between here and there. Two of those in-between spots
deserve special recognition: the shadowy realm between wakefulness and
sleep, and the transition between life and death.
Astrologers see Mercury as the symbol of communication, speech, writing,
knowledge, the intellect, reason, wit, and learning. Its position in your birth
chart determines the way you think, the speed with which you gather facts
and process information, the style with which you express yourself, and your
ability to tell a story (truthful or otherwise), give a speech, and use language.
Because it orbits the Sun so closely, Mercury is always either in the same
sign as the Sun or in an adjacent sign — and in no case is it ever more than
28° away from the Sun. To discover its position in your chart, turn to the
Appendix.
Mercury’s symbol has three metaphysical components: the cross of earth or
matter, the circle of spirit, and, perched on top, the crescent of personality
looking like a tiny satellite dish, ready to receive information.
For a description of the way your mind operates, look up Mercury in the
Appendix and read the appropriate paragraph in this list:
 Mercury in Aries: Never slow to jump to conclusions, you have a light-
ning-fast mind and a direct, forceful way of expressing yourself. Though
you can be impatient, competitive, and irritable (and often find it difficult
to concentrate), you’re never boring or wishy-washy. You’re willing to lay
down the law if you must. You express yourself assertively, and people
generally know what you think. (However, if Mercury is in your twelfth
house, you may try to conceal your opinions, usually without success.)
 Mercury in Taurus: You’re thoughtful, conservative, and remarkably
sensible. You gather your facts, construct a careful argument, and pre-
sent it diplomatically. After that, you only appear to consider other
103
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

points of view. In fact, having reached a reasoned decision with all delib-
erate speed, you see no reason to alter your opinion. You tend to be
inflexible, and it’s difficult to argue with you, in part because you have
the facts, and in part because opening up to fresh ideas is not easy for
you. You already know what you think.
 Mercury in Gemini: You’re smart, inquisitive, perceptive, persuasive,
humorous, slapdash, and clever. Your intellectual agility is extraordinary.
Your curious mind engages easily, you juggle a multitude of interests, and
you talk like the wind. You also bend with the wind. All too adaptable,
you can rationalize anything. Still, this is an enviable placement. Mercury
rules Gemini (and Virgo), so it works very effectively here.
 Mercury in Cancer: Sensitive and empathetic, you’re insightful, reflec-
tive, and exceedingly well tuned-in. You can communicate with verve and
compassion, and you absorb information readily. You have an amazing
memory and a remarkably intuitive mind. But your moods may swamp
your better judgment, and you’re prone to wishful thinking.
 Mercury in Leo: Dramatic, dignified, and ambitious, you think creatively,
express yourself vividly, and are confident in your opinions (though less
so if your Sun is in Cancer). An opinion leader, you usually see the big pic-
ture and are persuasive, eloquent, and organized in your thinking. You can
also be dogmatic, boastful, and unreserved in your enthusiasms. Okay,
sometimes you go overboard. As often happens with Leo placements,
your warmth overcomes your tendency to show off and carries the day.
 Mercury in Virgo: You’re smart, subtle, persistent, knowledgeable,
analytical, and sharp. Nothing escapes your notice, including logical
inconsistencies. A secret idealist who bemoans the distance between
how things are and how they ought to be, you can be a nitpicker, a critic,
or a prosecuting attorney. You’re also a brilliant thinker and a first-rate
conversationalist. Mercury rules Virgo, so this planet-sign combination
works exceptionally well. Feel confident: You have a fine mind.
 Mercury in Libra: Rational in thought and elegant in expression, you
seek a balanced viewpoint and intuitively understand that the best solu-
tion is generally the simplest. Prudent, discreet, and possessed of a
strong aesthetic sense, you manage to be objective in a charming, diplo-
matic way. You love to debate and are interested in the opinions of those
you respect. In the privacy of your own mind, you bounce up and down
on the seesaw of uncertainty, and because you try to consider all sides
of a question, it takes you awhile to reach a decision.
 Mercury in Scorpio: You have a penetrating, resourceful mind that con-
tinually probes beneath the surface. At your best, you’re an eagle-eyed
observer and a profound thinker. You take nothing at face value, and
often suffer from suspicion and even paranoia. You’re also analytical,
shrewd, incisive, and capable of digging out all sorts of information. This
is a great position for a detective, a researcher, or a therapist. It can be
dangerous too, because it also confers a biting wit and a persistent ten-
dency to use words as a weapon.
104
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Mercury in Sagittarius: You have a searching intellect and a wide-ranging
mind. When mulling over the big questions, as you love to do, you can
be inspired in your insights and grand in your philosophizing. As a con-
versationalist, you’re entertaining and wise. You can also be dogmatic,
hypocritical, and weak when it comes to details, and direct to the point
of tactlessness. Evangeline Adams, a great astrologer of the early 20th
century, complained in Astrology for Everyone that people with this place-
ment fail to keep their promises due to the “discontinuous and flitterbat
quality” of their minds. Your sense of humor is your salvation. (Think of
Woody Allen.)
 Mercury in Capricorn: Methodical, realistic, and organized, you’re a
systematic thinker. You know how to focus, and you act like an adult.
Though you can be conventional, rigid, and pessimistic, you try to be
even-handed in reaching conclusions, even if that means overcoming
your own biases. A serious thinker who values practical information,
you’re responsible enough to collect the facts, and you communicate
clearly and responsibly.
 Mercury in Aquarius: Fueled by ideas, you have an inventive, often bril-
liant mind (think of Thomas Edison). Progressive, humane, and happiest
when committed to a cause, you express yourself in unique ways and
often gain your greatest insight in momentary flashes of inspiration.
Your perceptions are distinctly your own. You can become totally
excited about a social problem or an abstract theory. Nothing wrong
with that — as long as you don’t become so attached to an idea that you
become inflexible, refusing to let facts — or people — stand in your way.
 Mercury in Pisces: Any planet in Pisces leads to the triumph of feeling
over fact. You respond to people and situations instinctively, often
making the right decision without knowing why. You understand how
people operate. And you find it easy to adapt to changing circumstances.
Your mind is receptive, subtle, empathetic, and imaginative, but logic is
not your strong suit. On the other hand, you have ready access to your
intuition, which runs like a river of impressions a fraction of an inch
beneath your conscious thoughts.
Venus: Love Conquers All
Whether it appears as the Morning Star or the Evening Star, Venus, the
second planet from the Sun, outshines almost every object in the sky.
Astronomers say that Venus is a hothouse hell, its fractured plains and
ancient volcanoes smothered beneath thick blankets of poisonous clouds.
With a surface temperature of 900° Fahrenheit, a totally toxic atmosphere,
and a surface pressure 100 times higher than that on Earth, it’s uninhabitable,
as unlovely a place as you can imagine.
105
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

The Greeks and the Romans saw it differently. In classical mythology, Venus
(Aphrodite to the Greeks) was the goddess of love and beauty. She was the
lover of Adonis (and others), the constant companion of the winged god
Eros, and the unfaithful wife of the god Vulcan, who caught her in bed with
her favorite paramour, Mars, the god of war.
Astrologers associate Venus with love, flirtation, seduction, beauty, art,
luxury, harmony, and pleasure. Venus rules the force of attraction, sexual and
otherwise. It describes the quality of your interactions with others, the way
you express your affections, your artistic impulses, and, strangely enough,
the way you deal with money.
Viewed from Earth, Venus can never be more than 48° from the Sun. That
translates to a maximum distance of two signs between Venus and the Sun.
To discover the position of Venus in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
The symbol for Venus includes two components from the Metaphysical tradi-
tion: the cross of earth and the circle of spirit. Most people today associate it
with the biological symbol for woman.
Venus represents your romantic tendencies, values, and response to beauty,
art, money, and possessions. To discover the way you express that side of
your personality, look up the location of Venus in the Appendix, and then
read the appropriate paragraph from the following list:
 Venus in Aries: Excitable, enthusiastic, and impulsive, you like to think
of yourself as a romantic adventurer. You fall in love impetuously and at
first sight — and fall out equally fast. More demanding than you realize
(and more self-centered), you’re affectionate, ardent, and easily aroused.
Even though you ultimately require mental compatibility, what gets you
going in the first place is physical appearance.
 Venus in Taurus: As the ruler of Taurus, Venus is completely at home
here, making you affectionate, charming, artistic, and sensual in the
extreme. All the comforts of life appeal to you, starting with rich food and
ending with long, luscious sexual encounters, preferably with the same
person every time. You value consistency, and though you’re capable of
fooling around, it’s not your natural mode. You require security, comfort,
cuddling, beautiful objects, an occasional push to get you moving, a com-
mitted partner, and a healthy bank account. Not to mention roses, pastry,
and sheets with as high a thread count as you can possibly afford.
 Venus in Gemini: The planet of love in the sign of the inconstant mind
produces witty banter, many happy hours of conversation and bookstore
browsing, lots of light-hearted flirtation, and an irresistible attraction to
people who are smart and quick. Your affections are easily swayed, and
you’re more than capable of carrying on a love affair entirely on the
Internet. The challenge is to distinguish between what ought to be a fine
romance (it sounds like a fabulous idea) and actual love.
106
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Venus in Cancer: A natural nester, you find your deepest pleasures in
home and family. You’re kind, sympathetic, sentimental, loyal, devoted,
popular, and a terrific cook (or you’d like to be anyway). You may appear
to be the epitome of self-confidence. Yet you require more than a little
psychological support. Your fear of rejection, however you try to disguise
it, may cause you to hold on too long to both lovers and friends. You
don’t mean to cling. It’s just that when you love someone, you want it to
last forever.
 Venus in Leo: Warm, outgoing, loyal, and luxury-loving, you’re creative,
self-dramatizing, and in love with love. You feel passionately and express
yourself flamboyantly. Love is an essential part of your nature, and you
tend to define yourself through it. You also love the arts. That doesn’t
mean you’re about to run away with an unpublished poet — not unless
said artiste has a trust fund. You’re happiest when the cash flows freely.
 Venus in Virgo: When you’re in love, you pay full attention, analyzing
every interaction, rereading every e-mail, and listening to your voice
mail repeatedly to make sure you’ve gotten every nuance. You’ll do any-
thing for your lover . . . including pointing out his flaws. You can be criti-
cal and controlling and full of opinions about how other people ought to
behave. Some people with this placement have flashy personalities
(those with the Sun in Leo, for instance). Most people with Venus in
Virgo are modest, inhibited, and a little shy between the sheets.
 Venus in Libra: You’re affectionate, gentle, warm, and willing to please.
A true romantic, you idealize love and often have trouble adapting to the
rough spots of a real relationship. When disappointment sets in, you
take it hard for a while, and then you get moving. You’re highly attractive
to other people, and there’s usually someone who’s circling around you.
This position also brings a strong aesthetic sensibility.
 Venus in Scorpio: Thanks to Scorpio’s infamous sexiness, this placement
sounds like a ticket to ecstasy. And sometimes it is. You get aroused in
the presence of mystery, intensity, and even a subtle hint of darkness.
Proud, passionate, and seductive, you’re prone to deep longing, both
sexual and emotional, and your love life tends to be stormy. At your best,
you’re deeply devoted and profoundly intimate. At your worst, you can
be jealous and vengeful. You’re also capable of pulling back from social
interaction and isolating yourself behind an invisible shield.
 Venus in Sagittarius: Demonstrative, ardent, direct, and excitable, you
see love as an adventure — not as a way to nail down a secure future.
You value your freedom, and your ideal lover is someone who helps you
see more of the world and experience more of life — not someone who
constricts your activities. You have noble ideals and are drawn to people
who are highly committed. You’re also intrigued by people who come
from backgrounds entirely different from your own. You don’t mind
shocking the folks.
107
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

 Venus in Capricorn: You’re sensual in your sexual liaisons, constant in
your affections, and cautious about revealing your emotions. You value
stability, propriety, and rectitude. The messiness of emotional free-for-alls
terrifies you, so you keep your feelings under wraps. Serious and sophis-
ticated, you admire anything classic. In art, as in love, you understand
the need for control. Sometimes you’re accused of privileging status over
more exalted ideals. And what’s wrong with that? You’re a realist, and you
know that in the real world, status matters.
 Venus in Aquarius: Open-minded, friendly, and idealistic, you’re drawn
to mavericks and rebels, and you have a multitude of friends — which is
exactly how you like it. You aren’t the most passionate person on the
planet, and you tend to enjoy a stimulating intellectual companionship
more than a romantic one. You also need a certain amount of solitude.
Ideas and causes appeal to you. Passionate displays do not. Ultimately,
you’re an independent sort, and your heart is difficult to capture.
 Venus in Pisces: You’re sentimental, artistic, devoted, and willing to do
anything for your beloved. You idealize your lovers and truly seek union
with them, but you have no idea what’s reasonable and what’s not.
Other people find it easy to abuse you, in part because you shrug your
shoulders helplessly and gratefully accept crumbs. Eventually, that
makes you angry, which is why you may become emotionally abusive,
often in a passive-aggressive way. You truly know how to love. That’s not
the problem. The problem is that you’re sometimes too willing to sacri-
fice your own needs to those of others.
Mars: Road Warrior
What a terrible reputation Mars has. Because it glows red in the sky (a result
of the iron oxide in its rocky soil), the Babylonians associated it with death
and destruction, Pacific Islanders thought of it as the home of a giant red pig,
and New Jerseyites, listening to Orson Welles on the radio in 1938, ran
screaming from their homes in fear of invading Martians. Yet people have
always fantasized about living on the red planet.
To the ancient Romans, Mars was the god of war, and many festivals were
held in his honor. Ares, the Greek equivalent, was not admired. Throughout
Greek mythology, Ares is constantly put down by the other gods — except for
Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of love, who adores him.
Early astrologers saw Mars as the planet of violence and bad temper. As late
as the 15th century, astrologers associated it with theft, murder, battle, lech-
ery, dishonesty, and seething malice of all sorts. Astrologers continue to
associate Mars with anger, accidents, and injury. They also see Mars as the
planet of action and desire. It brings will, stamina, drive, strength, energy, and
the courage to go after what you want. Mars makes things happen.
108

The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars takes almost two years — 687 days, to
be exact — to spin through the zodiac. It spends about two months in a sign.
(Once every year and a half, its pattern changes, and it lingers in one section
of the sky, giving that particular sign an extra jolt of Martian energy). No
matter what your Sun sign is, Mars can be in any of the 12 signs of the zodiac.
To discover its position in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
The position of Mars in your chart indicates an area where you’re energetic
and forceful. In biology, this figure represents the male, just as the symbol of
Venus corresponds to the female.
The position of Mars by sign describes the way in which you take the initiative,
assert yourself, and dive into a new endeavor or involvement. It represents
your drive and your desires. After you have located your Mars in the Appendix,
you can look it up in the list that follows:
 Mars in Aries: As the ruler of Aries, Mars endows its natives with energy,
sexual charisma to burn, and an occasionally explosive temper that you
must learn to control. Fortunately, you don’t hold on to your anger. After
you explode, it evaporates. Enthusiastic, assertive, and daring, you’re a
natural leader who commands attention even without seeking it.
 Mars in Taurus: You’re a hard-working, down-to-earth person with
plenty of stamina. Determined and sensible, you can be distracted by
the desires of the flesh. When you finally do commit yourself to some-
thing, whether it’s a relationship or a job, you’re in it for the long haul —
and for the money. Born with a serious practical streak, you care about
material possessions and status, often more than you’re willing to admit.
 Mars in Gemini: With the planet of aggression in the sign of the twins,
you’re high-spirited, argumentative, nervous, and irritable. Your energy
waxes and wanes, sometimes with startling speed. And although you
love to debate, you aren’t always able to distinguish between major prin-
ciples and minor points. Still, you enjoy the back-and-forth. You have a
lively, ingenious mind, and you’re loads of fun.
 Mars in Cancer: You’re an inherently emotional person who needs to get
a handle on your moods before you can successfully accomplish your
goals. Without realizing it, you tend to sulk. You’re highly sensitive, but
you may project signals so subtle that many people miss them. In a rela-
tionship, you can be possessive and tenacious when you ought to be
angry and out the door. You stew. You bury your emotions and need to
learn to be direct. You’re also responsive, protective, devoted, and imag-
inative, in bed and elsewhere.
 Mars in Leo: Confident, impassioned, and tireless, you have presence
and real follow-through. When committed to a cause or an activity,
you’re virtually unstoppable. True, you can be egotistical and arrogant,
and your need for an audience can be wearing. Nevertheless, your
warmth, high spirits, and willingness to take the first step bring you
many admirers. You create excitement.
109
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

 Mars in Virgo: Control is an issue for you. You’re hardworking, calculat-
ing, and willing to look reality dead in the eye. Sensible and methodical,
you can detach yourself emotionally when your success depends on it.
That quality is advantageous in your career. In your personal life, it gives
you the ability to turn your sex drive on and off, seemingly at will. (Several
famous military men share this placement, including Alexander the Great,
Napoleon Bonaparte, and General George Patton.)
 Mars in Libra: At your best, you’re friendly, flirtatious, charming, and
stylish. But you’re at a loss without a partner. In your love life, and even
at work, you’re happier when you have a partner. Also, although you
pride yourself on your logical mind, you tend to cover up your uncer-
tainties and insecurities by defending your ill-considered statements
with more passion than logic. At times people are forced to agree with
you, just to end the discussion.
 Mars in Scorpio: You’re courageous and cunning, determined and self-
sufficient. Blessed with fierce willpower and unwavering desires, you’re
highly sexed and intensely emotional. You may struggle with jealousy
and the desire to seek revenge. Although adapting to changing circum-
stances isn’t easy, you have a reliable source of internal energy and a
great deal of personal power, making this a beneficial placement overall.
 Mars in Sagittarius: Independent and enthusiastic, you have strong con-
victions, a love of the outdoors, and a deep desire for adventure. But you
can be slapdash and defiant, and your crusades, so eagerly launched,
don’t always reach completion. Early 20th century astrologer Evangeline
Adams, never one to pull her punches, claims that this placement makes
people “scintillating rather than solid, dashing rather than enduring.” Be
that as it may, you’re also fair, direct, and idealistic, and you can gather
your energy quickly — especially when you’re off on an adventure.
 Mars in Capricorn: Your desires, sexual and otherwise, are strong, your
ambitions focused. When you feel recognized, your energy is reliable
and steady. When you feel thwarted, your vitality fades. Efficient and
systematic, you respect tradition and authority and often rise to the top.
You understand hierarchies, and in many ways you’re a natural leader.
But when you don’t get the obedience you demand or when things
simply don’t go your way, you can be surprisingly cool. You usually hide
your anger. On the rare occasions when it slips out, however, it’s nasty.
 Mars in Aquarius: Whenever possible, you prefer the road less traveled.
You’re enterprising and impatient, and you don’t mind taking a risk.
Convention bores you, and you value the idea of progress. You’re inde-
pendent, idealistic, and friendly. But emotionally, you can be on the
chilly side, and you occasionally rebel just for the pleasure of making a
statement.
110
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Mars in Pisces: You fall deeply in love. You’re generous, moody, restless,
and highly intuitive. But when the emotional din becomes more than you
can tolerate, you shut down. When that happens, your willpower evapo-
rates, you have trouble getting motivated, you drive friends insane with
your passivity, and your physical energy disappears. One of the central
challenges of your life is regulating your energy. It’s not easy to do when
you’re a slave to your feelings.
Jupiter: More Is Better
Looking for luck? Your search is over. Auspicious Jupiter is the lord of luck,
the guardian of good fortune, and the champion of getting an even break.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system by far. More massive than all
the other planets combined, it could devour 1,330 Earths and still have room
to burp. Its most famous feature, known as the Great Red Spot, is a 300-year-
old cyclone that’s double the size of the Earth.
Not surprisingly, Jupiter was named for the king of the gods, who was known
in Greece as Zeus and in Rome as Jove or Jupiter Optimus Maximus — the
biggest and the best, even if he was also punitive and promiscuous. The
Greeks depicted him as bearded, dignified, and powerful — Zeus the father
figure, surveying the universe from his home on snowy Mount Olympus.
Astrologers associate Jupiter with opportunity, expansion, growth, abundance,
learning, success, optimism, and good cheer. Whatever Jupiter touches, it
expands. Of course, like every planet, it can express itself positively or nega-
tively. At its best, it brings good luck, generosity, and the ability to seize an
opportunity. When it’s tied to other planets through tension-producing aspects,
such as squares and oppositions (discussed in Chapter 13), it expresses its
shadow side by indulging in gluttony, laziness, and excess of all kinds.
Jupiter takes about 12 years to spin through the zodiac, spending about a year
in each sign. To discover its position in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
Rejoice when you see this symbol in your chart, for it marks an area of oppor-
tunity. According to metaphysical tradition, the symbol is made up of two
parts: the cross of matter and, rising above it, the curve of personality, indi-
cating the expansive unfurling of the self. That’s one way to remember it. Or
you can think of it as looking like a highly stylized number four.
111
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

Jupiter’s position by sign describes the way you try to broaden your horizons
and experience more of the world. It also indicates areas where you’re likely
to be lucky.
 Jupiter in Aries: You have confidence, energy, and enthusiasm. You
easily get fired up, even to the point of becoming manic, and you have
many interests, although you don’t sustain them over the long run. It’s
easy for you to get wound up in your own concerns, and you must guard
against the tendency to be egocentric and to lose control of the details.
 Jupiter in Taurus: You’re devoted and kind; a lover of nature, material
objects, and sensuous pleasures. You can easily tumble into self-
indulgence. So you’re great in bed — but you may also be plagued by
excess weight. Fortunately, you balance your pleasure-seeking with 
practicality. When it comes to the bottom line, your judgment is sound.
 Jupiter in Gemini: Nothing fires you up more than a curious idea — 
or a game show. You’re clever, multitalented, inquisitive, and easily
engrossed, although you run the risk of losing your interest in a topic by
talking it to death. You benefit from anything that involves writing —
from keeping a journal to working in a bookstore to being a journalist.

Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 
Galileo and the moons of Jupiter
About one hundred years after the birth of
Christ, the astronomer Ptolemy wrote a book
confidently asserting what everyone already
knew: That the Earth was the center of the uni-
verse, and that everything else — the Moon, the
Sun, the stars, and the planets — revolved
around it.
Over a millennium later, in 1453, Copernicus
showed that the Earth orbited the Sun, not the
other way around. His observations were not
widely accepted. Martin Luther referred to him
as an “upstart astrologer” (and in fact he was
an astrologer, as were most astronomers). For
the most part, people continued to put their faith
in Ptolemy. Few doubted that the Earth was the
center of the universe.
A century and a half later, Galileo trained his
telescope upon distant Jupiter and saw that it
was orbited by a population of moons. (He saw
four; scientists have now identified 16.) His
announcement was greeted with distress, par-
ticularly by the church, because if those four
moons were orbiting around Jupiter, then by
definition, not everything revolved around the
Earth and the Ptolemaic system had to be
wrong. Galileo ended up spending the rest of his
life under house arrest for his role in promoting
this new view of the heavens. His ideas tri-
umphed. Thus Jupiter and its many moons
opened up a new way to see the cosmos. In an
astrological chart, Jupiter has a similar function.
It opens things up; it expands the possibilities.

 Jupiter in Cancer: You’re openhearted, benevolent, intuitive, protective,
and sympathetic — the ultimate Earth mother, even if you’re a man.
Understanding and forgiving (sometimes pathetically so), you love the
pleasures of home, property, and parenthood. Traditional astrology
holds that Jupiter is exalted in this position, and experience shows that
it tends to bring luck in real estate. One downside: You may struggle
with your love of good food.
 Jupiter in Leo: You’re magnanimous, compassionate, exuberant, and
dramatic, with enormous vitality and a deep need for recognition,
respect, and power. Though you can be overbearing, you’re openhearted
and well liked. This position, considered a fortunate one, often brings
success.
 Jupiter in Virgo: You’re organized, practical, and happiest when your
efforts produce concrete results. You have a fine intellect, a strong work
ethic, and a tendency to put in too many hours in pursuit of perfection.
Jupiter is expansive while Virgo is restrictive, so this placement gives
rise to internal tension.
 Jupiter in Libra: You’re likable, sympathetic, fair, and popular. Gifted
with natural charm, you benefit from working with other people and
have an innate attraction to the arts. You may wrestle with the classic
Libran difficulty in making important decisions. Seeking balance is prob-
ably a wise idea for everyone, but it’s especially rewarding for you.
 Jupiter in Scorpio: You have huge passions, a magnetic intensity that
other people can sense, and a strongly sexual nature. Though you may
be reserved, you’re also observant, and you have a sincere interest in
investigating whatever’s under that rock. You’re ambitious and some-
times aggressive, with a great personal pride and a ferocious willpower
that can help you achieve your dreams.
 Jupiter in Sagittarius: Because Jupiter rules Sagittarius, this is consid-
ered an auspicious placement. Sagittarius brings out the best in Jupiter,
making you genial, optimistic, generous, tolerant, and philosophical (so
you don’t obsess over the small stuff). A skilled teacher, you’re drawn to
foreign travel, higher education, and large, all-encompassing philoso-
phies, religions, and belief systems. But be aware that this position also
inflates your faith (or fanaticism), along with your tendency to lecture.
 Jupiter in Capricorn: With the planet of expansion in cautious, con-
stricting Capricorn, you’re ambitious, dutiful, honest, serious-minded,
realistic, disciplined, and industrious, but you have a tough time relax-
ing. When you set a goal, your chances of achieving it are excellent.
Along the way, you may have to combat pessimism, but you also find joy
in accomplishment.
113
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

 Jupiter in Aquarius: Open-minded, altruistic, and innovative, you have
great originality and take an interest in everything that’s cutting edge.
You’re naturally tolerant of people, even if you’re sometimes scornful of
their ideas. But despite your humanitarian ideals, you don’t deal with
disappointment well, and you can become egotistical and overbearing.
 Jupiter in Pisces: Blessed with powerful intuitive and imaginative abili-
ties, you absorb everything going on around you. A forgiving and empa-
thetic person, you cherish the notion that you can make things better,
even to the point of self-sacrifice. But when you feel overwhelmed,
which happens more than you may want, you can turn into a hermit.
Spiritual pursuits intrigue and sustain you.
Saturn: Lord of the Rings
Before the invention of the telescope, Saturn was the most distant planet that
anyone could see. It marked the end of the solar system. Naturally, it came to
represent limits. Today, it remains the most distant planet that’s easily visible
with the naked eye, so that meaning still applies. But its image has improved.
Thanks to the telescope and the Voyager space missions, everyone knows
what Saturn looks like. Even people who have never looked through a tele-
scope have seen pictures of its dazzling ring structure. And they know that
it’s the most beautiful planet in the solar system.
The second largest planet (after Jupiter), Saturn is a gas giant surrounded by
a broad collar of icy rings and at least 18 named moons (and counting). It’s so
large that 95 Earths could fit inside it. But its density is so low that, if there
were an ocean large enough to hold the entire planet, Saturn would float.
In mythology, Saturn was originally an Italian corn god. The Romans identi-
fied him with the Greek god Kronos, who swallowed his own children and
was in turn conquered by them. He’s known as Father Time, the symbol of
the past and the old order.
In astrology, Saturn represents the system. Its influence is serious and somber.
It brings structure, discipline, limitations, boundaries, responsibility, duty,
perseverance, and fear. It tests people and forces them to confront reality.
As a result, Saturn has a terrible reputation, one that has been nurtured by
generations of astrologers, including the great Evangeline Adams. In Astrology
for Everyone, she explains that Saturn “blights all that he gazes on. He is the
curse of disappointment, not of anger. He freezes the water-springs; he is the
dry-rot and the death of the ungodly. He looks upon the Sun, despairs; in cynic
bitterness his draught is brewed, and he drinks it, wishing it were poison. His
breath withers up love; his word is malediction . . . But in each one of us this
principle exists; it is the most inescapable of all our fates.”
114
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

With publicity like that, it’s no wonder that followers of astrology came to
fear Saturn. Yet its reputation isn’t entirely deserved because, although
Saturn does bring difficulties, it also helps create order. Saturn’s influence
enables you to conquer your fears and to combat your inertia. If it forces you
to struggle with depression, disappointment, poverty, and other obstacles, it
also compels you to seek solutions, to set goals, to establish schedules, to
work harder than you ever thought you could, and to get organized. Saturn is,
in short, the planet of accomplishment.
Saturn takes 291⁄2 years to travel through the zodiac. It spends about 21⁄2 years
in each sign. To discover its position in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
The symbol of Saturn, wherever it may be in your chart, marks the spot of
your greatest challenges. Metaphysical astrologers describe it as the cross of
matter and circumstances rising out of the crescent of personality, suggesting
that humans create their own limitations and must find ways to confront
them. An easier way to remember the symbol is that it resembles a curvy
lowercase “h” (for “hard” or perhaps “hellish”) with a slash mark across it
like a French “7.”
Saturn’s placement by sign determines your sense of inadequacy, your fears
and hesitations, the obstacles and liabilities that block your path, and the
ways in which you try to overcome them.
 Saturn in Aries: You’re an independent thinker: You can’t stand to
follow the leader, but you don’t like directing other people either.
Though you’re entrepreneurial, determined, and disciplined, you can
also be inconsiderate and domineering. Given a goal and a game plan,
you do fabulously well. Without direction, you flounder. Nor can the goal
be imposed on you by someone else. It must come from within.
 Saturn in Taurus: Images of the poorhouse dance in your head. You
have an intense need for stability, and the thought of being without
money terrifies you. So you learn to manage your resources effectively
and may even become quite well-heeled. You’re industrious, prudent,
and methodical. The downside? You’re stubborn, you lack spontaneity,
and you run the risk of becoming a plodder. And although some people
with this placement become obsessed with sex or other pleasures,
you’re secretly ambivalent about such things, and you’re equally likely
to deny yourself such material comforts.
 Saturn in Gemini: You’re smart, serious, and articulate despite your fear
of being considered intellectually inferior or at a loss for words. You’re
an excellent problem-solver, with an active mind and dozens of interests.
Like any placement in the sign of the Twins, Saturn in Gemini can reveal
itself in a number ways. When you’re hot, your ability to concentrate is
inspiring — and intimidating. At other times, you run the risk of fritter-
ing away your energy and diluting your intentions with meaningless
activity and chatter. You have a clear and lucid mind, but beware: You
can convince yourself of anything.
115
Chapter 9: The Personal Planets

 Saturn in Cancer: Not an easy placement, Saturn in Cancer generally
brings a difficult childhood with at least one parent who’s cold or with-
holding. As a result, you may be insecure and inhibited, with a yearning
for emotional control and understanding. Your attempt to win the love
you lacked as a child can become the quest of a lifetime. Some people
with this placement become clingy or cover up their fear of vulnerability
by acting overly confident or indifferent. (The disguise, by the way, fools
no one.) Most attempt to create in adulthood what they lacked in child-
hood by becoming tolerant, protective, loving parents.
 Saturn in Leo: Determined and dignified, you long to be creative but are
afraid of expressing yourself. You want to be recognized — yet you’re
terrified of being mediocre. That’s the Catch-22 you must overcome. Self-
doubt wears you down and gets you nowhere. The challenge of this posi-
tion is to acknowledge, not bury, your need for recognition and to find a
way to achieve it. Similarly, your creative urges need dramatic expres-
sion and positive acceptance. Overcome a tendency to arrogance, the
scourge of Leo. Dare to be dramatic. You’ll be much happier.
 Saturn in Virgo: You’re analytical, worried, industrious, and drawn to soli-
tude. (In a previous life, according to one of my first astrology teachers,
you may have been a medieval monk.) Because you fear losing control,
you do your best to nail down every detail. Ritual relaxes you, and you
rely on a string of routines you have established in your everyday life.
Though you prefer things to be orderly and predictable, those routines
can also limit, confine, and ultimately overwhelm you. Take as your motto
this quotation from Henry David Thoreau (from Where I lived, and What I
Lived For): “Our life is frittered away by detail . . . Simplify, simplify.”
 Saturn in Libra: This favorable position makes you rational, reliable, dis-
creet, and serious. You fear being alone, which makes you all the more
anxious when you try to connect with other people. Your relationships
thoroughly reflect you — yet you may not like what you see. You may
feel that they somehow fail to measure up. Fortunately, you’re always
willing to negotiate. Although you may think you desire a passionate
entanglement, you’re ultimately far happier when you make the sensible
choice. You tend to marry someone older, and you may marry late.
 Saturn in Scorpio: You’re resourceful and powerful, with strong convic-
tions and a great sense of purpose. Dependency issues can be tough for
you, and you may struggle to define yourself as an individual while main-
taining a relationship. You have compelling sexual needs, yet sex is also
complicated for you. Although you’re prone to jealousy and resentment,
you find the courage to deal with your problems and conquer your fears,
including fear of death. Mysteries fascinate you, and none more than the
mystery of your own psyche.
116
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Saturn in Sagittarius: “Don’t fence me in” is your refrain. You seek
adventure, travel, and broad horizons. But unless you find a structured
way to achieve your goals, circumstances may conspire to keep you
from achieving them. Education is important for you, and the philosoph-
ical or moral precepts that you live by shape your life. Even though you
may fantasize about being independent and footloose, what you actually
need is to find meaning in your daily activities, to expand your philo-
sophical viewpoint, and to travel widely — literally or figuratively —
with purpose.
 Saturn in Capricorn: You’re capable, ambitious, and pragmatic, with
natural authority and obvious competence. Because you crave recogni-
tion and are secretly afraid that you won’t get it, you doggedly pursue
your goals and you make sure to follow the rules — even if you have to
give up your more original ideas along the way. You don’t like restric-
tions, but you know how to deal with them and can work within a struc-
ture. You can even overcome your tendency to depression. Saturn rules
Capricorn, so this is considered an excellent placement.
 Saturn in Aquarius: You have a clear and original mind, an unusual
sense of organization and structure, and the ability to influence others.
Liberal-minded and unselfish (in part because you don’t want people to
think ill of you), you conceive of yourself as a member of society, a small
part of a larger whole. And you’re a person of principle. It’s essential for
your happiness and self-respect that you live in accordance with your
ideals, which are generally of the noblest sort. Material success isn’t a
motivating force in your life — your values matter more.
 Saturn in Pisces: You’re sympathetic and intuitive. Your sensitivity makes
you appealing to others, and your creativity brings you satisfaction. You
may also suffer from more than your share of neuroses, anxieties, and
baseless apprehensions. Though you understand how other human
beings operate, you may be at a loss when it comes to solving your
own problems (especially if substance abuse happens to be one of
them). You’re afraid of chaos and isolation, and you struggle to stave
off those terrors. Establishing routines is helpful. Becoming addicted
is your undoing.

U
ntil 1781, astrologers cast horoscopes using only the Sun, the Moon,
and the five planets visible from Earth: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn. Then William Herschel, a professional musician and amateur tele-
scope maker, made a momentous breakthrough. After years of staying up at
night with his devoted sister and obsessively (he was a Scorpio) mapping the
skies over Bath, England, he became the first human being in history to train
a telescope on the night sky and discover a planet. That discovery — of the
planet Uranus — rocked the astronomical world. That oddball planet, identi-
fied in the midst of the American War of Independence and only a few years
before the French Revolution, transformed the commonly held view of the
solar system. In astrology, it soon became associated with revolutions of all
kinds, including the personal, political, and scientific.
In the next century, scientists realized that anomalies in the orbit of Uranus
could be accounted for by the presence of another planet. In 1846, after a
search marked by total confusion (in keeping with the nature of the planet),
European astronomers identified that unknown body and named it Neptune.
A third discovery further expanded the solar system in 1930, when Clyde
Tombaugh, a 23-year-old amateur who was hired to examine photographic
plates of the night sky, found what he was looking for: A tiny, distant body,
which is now named Pluto.

All these celestial bodies — Uranus and Neptune, as well as Pluto and
Chiron — differ from the visible planets of antiquity. The visible planets
reflect individual disposition, and were consequently known as personal
planets. Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, which can found in the outer reaches
of the solar system, don’t describe personality as much as they shape gen-
erations. After all, the Sun swings through all 12 signs in a year — but Chiron
takes 51 years to travel through the signs, Uranus requires 84 years to make
a single orbit, Neptune needs 165 years, and tiny Pluto requires almost two
and a half centuries to complete its tour of the zodiac. These celestial bodies
have a minor impact on day-to-day activities. Instead, they define genera-
tions, spark momentous events, and bring hidden potentials to light.
The outer planets are also harbingers of change, both external and internal.
These planets shake you up (revolutionary Uranus), inspire and confuse you
(nebulous Neptune), and push you to the brink (take-no-prisoners Pluto).
They represent the invincible, unstoppable, cosmic forces of change.
The generational dates given in parentheses later in this chapter for these
planetary placements aren’t exact. What actually happens when Neptune,
Uranus, or Pluto changes signs is that for almost a year (and occasionally for
longer than that), the planet appears to ricochet back and forth between the
old sign and the new one. As a result, if you were born during (or even close
to) the first or final year of a planet’s journey through a sign, you can’t rely on
the ballpark dates given in this chapter. Flip to the Appendix instead. Or go to
the Internet to get a copy of your chart (see Chapter 2).

Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 
Poor Pluto’s demotion
When it was discovered, Pluto was hailed as
the ninth planet. Since then, astronomers have
discovered many small, icy, celestial objects
orbiting the Sun. And so they’ve begun to
rethink what it means to be a planet. Is it enough
to simply orbit the Sun? Well, no. After all, aster-
oids revolve around the Sun, as do comets. Is it
enough to be above a certain size? Or to orbit
the Sun from within the plane of the solar
system? By those standards, Pluto doesn’t qual-
ify. It’s small, its orbit is tilted, and it has a pecu-
liar gravitational relationship to its largest moon.
As a result, Pluto, the most idiosyncratic of the
traditional planets, has been demoted. In 2006,
astronomers dubbed it a “dwarf planet” and
turned their backs on it. Astrologers are stick-
ing with it. Okay, maybe Pluto, which is slightly
smaller than our Moon, isn’t as imposing as the
other planets. Size isn’t everything. Besides,
Pluto isn’t the only small object that astrologers
heed. Another such body is Chiron, which
wasn’t discovered until 1977 and is now rou-
tinely incorporated into natal charts. (I discuss
Chiron at the end of this chapter.)

Uranus: The Rebel
As the first planet discovered through the use of technology, Uranus is the
planet of revolution and the modern age. It rules electricity, technology, and
everything on the cutting edge. It’s also said to be the planet of astrology.
Uranus is a shocker. In a birth chart, it represents the part of you that’s most
original and inventive, that shuns convention, craves freedom, and attracts —
or creates — abrupt change. It can stir up senseless rebellion, studied eccen-
tricity, restlessness, turmoil, and agitated states of mind. It can also herald
unexpected, life-altering events, typically in areas where you haven’t been
paying attention. Uranus, it must be said, can shatter your world.
Uranus also generates flashes of insight, brilliant ideas, and new vistas when
you need them the most. It’s the iconoclastic lord of genius, inventiveness,
originality, and everything that captures you by surprise. When lightning
strikes, be it in the form of an unexpected pink slip or a bizarre career oppor-
tunity, love at first sight or an unforeseen divorce, a lottery win or a housing
crisis, you can bet that Uranus, the emissary of disruption, is at work.
It takes 84 years — a human lifetime — for Uranus and its 15 moons to travel
through the zodiac. Like Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, Uranus is a gas giant.
But while every other planet rotates on its axis in a more-or-less upright fash-
ion, unconventional Uranus seems to roll around on its side with its north
pole pointing to the Sun. As a result, the Uranian day is 42 years long, and the
night is the same length.
The symbol of Uranus (see Figure 10-1) looks like an old-fashioned TV
antenna — an apt image for the planet associated with electricity, technology,
and the future. The symbol also incorporates a letter H, a reminder of William
Herschel, who discovered the planet in 1781.
Understanding Uranus
Uranus spends about seven years in each sign. Like Neptune and Pluto, it
makes its greatest impact on generations. In an individual chart, its influence
is subtle — most of the time. But when it’s prominent in a birth chart, Uranus
is the mark of geniuses, idealists, iconoclasts, nonconformists, eccentrics,
inventors, revolutionaries, and astrologers.

Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

And when, over the course of its 84-year cycle, it stimulates the Sun, the
Moon, and the other planets in a birth chart, it can beget turmoil, foolish
accidents, hair-raising relationship upheaval, amazing job shifts, and — in
short — whatever mayhem it takes to loosen you up and liberate you.
Uranus, like the other outer planets, primarily influences generations rather
than individuals — unless it happens to occupy a strong position in your
natal chart. It’s prominent in your horoscope if
 It occupies an angle — that is, it’s in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth
house of your chart. It’s especially powerful if it’s within approximately
8° of your Ascendant or Midheaven. (See Chapter 11 for more on
Ascendants and Midheavens.)
 It makes a number of close aspects to other planets and, in particular, to
the Sun, the Moon, or the planet that rules your Ascendant. (See Chapter
13 for a discussion of aspects.)
 You have one or more planets in Aquarius.
To check the position of Uranus in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
Uranus in the signs
The sign that Uranus occupies in your birth chart determines the way you
and other members of your generation shake off the burden of expectation,
rebel against the established order, liberate yourself from fear, and express
your most original self.
 Uranus in Aries (1927 to 1935): You’re feisty, indomitable, and impa-
tient, and you value your freedom to an extraordinary degree. You’re a
pioneering spirit, brave at your core. When change is called for, you rush
in, preferring the risks of being impulsive to the so-called safety of the
slow-and-sensible approach. You’re intrepid and inventive, even if your
enthusiasms do flicker on and off. Change exhilarates you.
 Uranus in Taurus (1935 to 1942): Once you admit that you want some-
thing and begin going after it, nothing can stop you. Your willpower
helps you overcome all obstacles. You also feel strongly about money
and possessions and you may suffer financial ups and downs. You gravi-
tate toward concrete, innovative methods of making money.
 Uranus in Gemini (1942 to 1949): You’re clever, inquisitive, nervous,
chatty, versatile, and mentally restless. You deal with change by refram-
ing it — you’d rather feel like an unconscious architect of your own fate
than like a victim of circumstance. You gravitate toward original ideas
and new ways of communicating. You’re also easily distracted with a ten-
dency to procrastinate.
122
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Uranus in Cancer (1949 to 1956): You have an active imagination, a sen-
sitive disposition, and an unusual family life. You may move frequently
or experience disruptions in your home life. Much as you long for the
security of a nuclear family, you also rebel against it, and when you’re in
a traditional family (or even a standard-issue house), you may alter its
structure.
 Uranus in Leo (1956 to 1962): Assertive and freewheeling, ardent and
talented, you enthusiastically throw yourself into creative endeavors.
Offbeat love affairs (the more reckless the better) entice and excite you,
and you approach times of change with gusto. But you can also be ego-
tistical, imperious, and — in a word — obnoxious.
 Uranus in Virgo (1962 to 1969): Even though you have an acute and ana-
lytical mind, you rebel against routine — especially on the job, where
your need for freedom takes you in surprising directions. Your approach
to science, technology, and health is both original and practical. And
although you rebel against routines enforced by others, you’re skilled at
creating your own highly individual, compulsively followed patterns.
 Uranus in Libra (1969 to 1975): You’re imaginative and artistic, although
members of other generations may be appalled at your taste. They may
also be surprised by your relationships, romantic and otherwise, because
you’re attracted to unusual people and situations. In many ways your
generation is forging an innovative approach to relationships — one that
incorporates a high degree of personal freedom. Still, in times of stress,
you’re happiest with a companion by your side.
 Uranus in Scorpio (1975 to 1981): Deeply intuitive and strong-willed,
you’re charismatic and determined, with unusual attitudes toward sex
and death, subjects of eternal fascination to you. Sudden infatuations
and lengthy obsessions may plague you. Finances also absorb you, and
you may experience sudden economic shifts. You’re resourceful and
unafraid, and when change is in the air, you choose to experience it
deeply and consciously, with an eye to the future.
 Uranus in Sagittarius (1981 to 1988): You’re optimistic and free-spirited,
with large aspirations. You resent naysayers who denigrate your dreams,
and you refuse to be constrained by practical concerns. You’d like to see
the world — but not by following someone else’s itinerary. You’d like to
achieve spiritual enlightenment — but you rebel against standard reli-
gions. Travel and education excite you — but only when you approach
them in your own unique ways. You feel liberated by the forces of change.
 Uranus in Capricorn (1988 to 1996): You’re ambitious, responsible, and
methodical. Yet you instinctively shun the prescribed path and the old-
fashioned hierarchy. As a result, your career takes some surprising
turns. If you can express your individuality within an organization or a
system, fine. If not, your deep sense of discomfort forces you to bring it
to its knees and create an entirely new system. You’re a force for con-
structive change.
123
Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

 Uranus in Aquarius (1996 to 2003): You’re tolerant, unsentimental,
humanitarian, and inventive. A nonconformist and idealist at heart, you
celebrate individuality in others and number many an oddball among
your friends. Amazing coincidences and strokes of luck characterize
your life. Uranus works well in Aquarius, so when you embrace change,
your world opens up. When you resist it, unhappiness follows. This is
also a fine placement for scientific and technological explorations.
 Uranus in Pisces (2003 to 2011): Imaginative, talented, and intuitive,
you’re susceptible to strange dreams and psychic flashes. You have a
deep sense of compassion and an attraction to unusual forms of spiritu-
ality, although you may suffer from feelings of alienation or isolation. At
these times, escapism beckons and your willpower needs support. Art
and spiritual pursuits provide a fulfilling path for you.

The secret of the 1960s
Why are some decades more exciting than
others? The outer planets are usually to blame.
They travel slowly through the zodiac. When
they combine their considerable energies by
moving in tandem, things start to cook.
In the 1960s, for example, freedom-loving
Uranus and Pluto, the planet of transformation,
were aligned in the same sign of the zodiac
(Virgo) for the first time in over a century. (The
previous time was around 1848, when a wave of
revolutions swept across Europe.) Working
together, Uranus and Pluto strengthened and
stirred each other up, turning revolutionary
Uranian impulses into something that made pro-
found impressions on society and in many ways
transformed it. The civil rights movement, the
antiwar movement, the sexual revolution, the
student movement, the Weather underground,
feminism, gay rights, the Moon walk, and even
the horrific assassinations that characterized
the decade are all manifestations of the icono-
clastic, revolutionary Uranian impulse deep-
ened by the transformative power of Pluto.
At the time, even such cultural touchstones as
Woodstock, LSD, communes, Stranger in a
Strange Land, and vegetarian lesbian collec-
tives (for example) seemed fraught with cosmic
resonance. Not only did they symbolize the
Uranian urge to rebel against the repressive
adult society of the 1950s, they also took on
the profundity of Pluto and the significance of
philosophy — or so it appeared at the time. And
if, in retrospect, a few expressions of the era
look ridiculous, it’s also true that many reper-
cussions of those long-ago, tie-dyed days will
simply not fade away.
If you were born between 1962 and 1969, you
have both rebellious Uranus and transformative
Pluto in Virgo. Although the impracticality of
much of what went down in the 1960s probably
irritates you, on some level you’re deeply in
sync with the urge to break away from old
forms, alter the hidebound assumptions of main-
stream society, and give peace a chance.

Neptune: The Dreamer
In 1612, Galileo gazed through his little telescope (practically a toy by today’s
standards) and saw what looked like a dim star — except that, unlike the
other stars, it moved. He even drew a picture of it, and if he’d been thinking,
he would have realized that it was a planet. Alas, he didn’t put two and two
together, and he missed the opportunity to identify Neptune.
Two hundred years later, Neptune continued to be elusive. By the middle of
the 19th century, two scientists, one French and one English, working sepa-
rately, had pinpointed the planet’s location in theory but neither could gain
access to a large telescope to confirm it. If they had, they would have found it
in precisely the predicted spot (in Aquarius). But neither of them had the
wherewithal to make it happen. Finally, in 1846, one of them asked astronomers
in Germany to undertake a search for the new planet. Johann Galle, a young
assistant at the Berlin Observatory, found it within an hour.
In NASA photographs, Neptune looks like a luminous turquoise marble,
almost without features. Astronomers classify Neptune as a gas giant
because, like Uranus, it’s essentially a ball of gasses swirling around a metal
core. It sports a dim halo of barely visible rings and has at least eight moons,
including Triton — the coldest place in the solar system.
Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. Its symbol (see Figure 10-2)
resembles that god’s three-pronged trident.
Assessing Neptune’s influence
Impressionistic Neptune rules intuition, dreams and visions, psychic ability,
imagination, glamour, and everything that flows. Neptune finds expression in
dance, music, poetry, and daydreams. It stimulates compassion, dissolves
boundaries, and sensitizes anything it touches. Idealistic and deeply spiritual,
it also has a dark side. Neptune is the planet of illusion, confusion, deceit,
vagueness, and wishful thinking. When prominent in a positive way, Neptune
brings artistic talent and imagination, spiritual leanings, and psychic abilities.
Under negative conditions, it accentuates the tendency to drift and increases
the danger of addiction, hypochondria, and escapism.

Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

Neptune doesn’t affect everyone equally. Like the other outer planets, it
tends to influence generations more strongly than individuals. But there are
exceptions. How can you tell if you have a powerful Neptune? Neptune occu-
pies a prominent position in your birth chart if
 It occupies an angle — that is, it’s in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth
house of your chart. It’s especially strong if it’s near your Ascendant or
Midheaven. (See Chapter 11 for more on Ascendants and Midheavens.)
 It makes a number of close aspects to other planets and, in particular, to
the Sun, the Moon, or the planet that rules your Ascendant. (See Chapter
13 for a discussion of aspects.)
 You have one or more planets in Pisces.
Neptune spends an average of 14 years in each sign. To discover its position
in your chart, turn to the Appendix.
Neptune in the signs
Neptune’s position by sign describes the ways your generation is most
idealistic — and most unrealistic. Its position in your horoscope represents
an area of imagination, idealism, and spirituality (on the positive side), and
aimless drifting, confusion, and deception (on the negative side).
 Neptune in Aries (1861 to 1875): Members of this generation had an
intuitive sense of self and took an active approach to their spiritual life.
They could be wildly inconsiderate, and they had trouble regulating
their aggression, being at times far too weak (like Neville Chamberlain)
and at other times far too reckless (like Winston Churchill at Gallipoli).
But one member of this generation, expressing Neptune in Aries at its
most rarefied, transformed the very nature of conflict: Mahatma Gandhi,
the prophet of nonviolence (who was nonetheless assassinated in 1948).
Neptune returns to this position in 2026.
 Neptune in Taurus (1875 to 1889): People born with this placement
loved art, soft textures, rich food, real estate, the beauties of nature, and
all the sensual comforts. (Casanova, born in 1725, had this placement.
So did Pablo Picasso.) They were tuned into the physical world and
responded intuitively to the rhythms of the body. But by and large they
had difficulties in dealing with the practical stuff — finances included.
Examples include Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Albert Einstein.
Neptune returns to the sign of the bull in 2039.
126
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Neptune in Gemini (1889 to 1902): People born during the last decade
or so of the Gilded Age had subtle, clever, complicated minds along with
literary talent, a tendency to be shallow, and a vast capacity for spin.
(Edward Bernays, known as “the father of public relations,” was born
with this placement.) They idealized education and admired the intel-
lect. But many of them struggled with the truth and may have discov-
ered that the more you deceive others, the more you are deceived.
 Neptune in Cancer (1902 to 1915): “What a wonderful world,” said the
great Louis Armstrong, who was born with this placement. You agree.
You’re observant, receptive, and sentimental — and not just because
you’re old. The old-fashioned virtues of home, family, and country make
you misty-eyed, and you tend to romanticize the past. (Which is not to
suggest that your politics are necessarily conservative: Ronald Reagan
had this placement, but so did Eugene McCarthy.) As part of the genera-
tion that experienced virtually all the great and awful events of the 20th
century, you long for security and rely on family. As long as you feel pro-
tected, you’re doing fine.
 Neptune in Leo (1915 to 1929): You’re extravagant, artistic, and roman-
tic — or at least you’d like to be. You idealize love, children, and the cre-
ative process. You take big risks — and you often win your outrageous
bets. But you’re prone to infatuation and may refuse to face reality, pre-
ferring the glitter of your fabulous ideals to the gritty imperfections of
reality. And I hate to say it, but you can become so enamored of an ideal
that you fail to see how moth-eaten it actually is.
 Neptune in Virgo (1929 to 1942): Neptune, the planet of murky vague-
ness, isn’t happy in meticulous Virgo. With this placement, you can’t
always tell which details matter and which ones don’t — so you may
become anxious about all the wrong things. Hypochondria is a definite
threat. But work that taps the imagination and spiritual activities that
focus on service bring you joy.
 Neptune in Libra (1942 to 1957): Idealistic and compassionate, you long
for tranquility, balance, and — most of all — love. You respond strongly
to art and music. But romantic relationships are mystifying to you, and
your high ideals about human interaction (and marriage in particular)
are always bumping up against reality. If you were born with this place-
ment, you can expect to experience great shifts in the rules of human
relationships over the course of your life.
 Neptune in Scorpio (1957 to 1970): Dream interpretation, occult studies,
and mystery novels pique your interest, but nothing fascinates you more
than the workings of the psyche. A detective of the spirit, you project 
an aura of magnetic intensity and instinctively understand the concept 
of sexual healing. But you’re also prone to sexual extremes and self-
destructive behavior, and you may be unable to recognize the sources 
of your own pain.
127
Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

 Neptune in Sagittarius (1970 to 1984): Questions of philosophy, faith,
and religious values intrigue you. You find them easy to discuss but diffi-
cult to resolve. On some level, dogma makes you uncomfortable because
your belief system is constantly evolving. You have a thirst for personal
freedom and travel (ideally to sacred spots). But you tend to be gullible,
and you’re easily misled. Be cautious in dealing with anyone who wants
to be considered a guru. Sooner or later, you’re going to feel mighty
uncomfortable about that.
 Neptune in Capricorn (1984 to 1998): You’re ambitious, pragmatic, and
nostalgic about the old-fashioned values of the past — or the past as
you imagine it. You long for success and idealize the world of business,
but you may have trouble acknowledging problems you experience
there. Vagueness and uncertainty make you uneasy, and you must
combat a tendency to overreact by becoming authoritarian. Your spiri-
tual longings are best satisfied within structured organizations.
 Neptune in Aquarius (1998 to 2012): As one of the enlightenment-
seeking, technologically gifted, altruistic people born since Neptune
entered Aquarius in 1998, you possess an intuitive sense of the common
good and a progressive approach to social reform. But you may idealize
your friends, and your desire to live in a utopian community with a sim-
patico group of spiritually-minded, ecologically-aware individuals may
be more difficult to achieve than you imagine.
 Neptune in Pisces (2012 to 2026): You have the typical traits of Pisces —
squared. You’re psychic, generous, creative, empathetic, mystical, gullible,
possibly self-destructive, a lover of fantasy and film, an aficionado of com-
plex (or ascetically pared-down) music, a daydream believer, and a likely
candidate for all manner of addictions. Sigmund Freud, Johann Sebastian
Bach, Vincent van Gogh, and Theodore Roosevelt all had this placement.
The next Neptune in Pisces generation should be interesting to watch.
Pluto: The Power of Transformation
Before August 2006, Pluto was just another planet. Then the members of the
International Astronomical Union pronounced it a dwarf planet. That demo-
tion is irrelevant to astrologers. Astrologers believe that Pluto possesses the
power of transformation, and nothing’s going to change that.
Pluto is small, rocky, and so mysterious that astronomers aren’t sure what to
make of it. Its elongated orbit, which is tilted to the rest of the solar system,
overlaps the orbit of Neptune. As a result, from 1979 to 1999, Pluto was closer
to the Sun than Neptune. Pluto’s major moon, Charon, is so relatively large
128
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

that some astronomers classified Pluto as a double planet. (That was before
they decided it was a dwarf.) Other astronomers believed it to be an asteroid
far away from home, a chunk of rock left over from the creation of the solar
system, or a renegade moon that once belonged to Neptune. Regardless of its
classification, astrologers agree that Pluto represents something profound in
human nature.
In classical mythology, Pluto (Hades to the Greeks) was the god of the under-
world, the king of the dead, and the god of wealth, reflecting the fact that
gold, silver, and precious gems are found buried in the earth. Virtually every
major character in mythology undertakes a journey to the underworld, which
represents the darkest, most fear-laden part of the psyche. The return to the
land of the living suggests renewal and transformation.
Thus, to astrologers, Pluto represents death, regeneration, and rebirth. It
destroys, purifies, purges, and renews, bestowing consciousness on that
which has been hidden and ultimately bringing transformation. The process
can be tedious because Pluto moves at a glacial speed and its path is strewn
with obstacles. But the rewards are life-changing.
Pluto has two symbols. One is a snazzy-looking metaphysical design: A small
circle held within a crescent and balanced on a cross. I don’t use this symbol
because it’s too easy to confuse with the glyphs of the other planets (Mercury
and Neptune in particular). But many astrologers prefer it.
I’m partial to the second, more mundane symbol, which has its origins in the
world of science. That symbol (see Figure 10-3) represents both the first two
letters of Pluto’s name and the initials of the aristocratic astronomer Percival
Lowell, who was so convinced that there was life on Mars that he built an
observatory in Arizona for the sole purpose of observing it. At the same time,
he devoted himself to a search for the mysterious Planet X, which he believed
was revolving around the sun in the outskirts of the solar system, way past
Neptune. He never found it. But 14 years after Lowell’s death, Clyde Tombaugh
worked doggedly at the Lowell Observatory and discovered Pluto. This
symbol acknowledges Lowell’s contributions.

of Pluto.

Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

Pinpointing Pluto’s influence
Like Uranus and Neptune, Pluto primarily influences generations. Its influ-
ence in an individual’s birth chart is usually subtle — unless Pluto occupies a
prominent spot in your chart. Pluto is prominent if
 It occupies an angle — that is, it’s in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth
house of your chart. It’s especially strong if it’s close to your Ascendant
or Midheaven. (See Chapter 11 for more on Ascendants and Midheavens.)
 It makes a number of close aspects to other planets and, in particular, to
the Sun, the Moon, or the planet that rules your Ascendant.
 You have one or more planets in Scorpio.
Even though Pluto spends, on average, about 20 years in each sign of the
zodiac, it hurries through some signs (it’s in and out of Libra in a dozen years)
and plods through others (like Taurus, where it lingers for 32 long years). To
discover its position at your birth, turn to the Appendix.
Pluto in the signs
Pluto’s placement by sign determines the deepest obsessions of your genera-
tion as well as the style with which you approach transforming life events.
 Pluto in Aries (1823 to 1852): This generation was willful, rebellious,
impulsive, and obsessed with power and independence.
 Pluto in Taurus (1852 to 1884): Security brought power for these hard-
working folks, but values, particularly regarding possessions, were in
flux. With Pluto in an earth sign, ownership was an issue. The American
Civil War was fought during those years over that very compulsion.
 Pluto in Gemini (1884 to 1914): Wit rules. Novelty excites you.
Unconsciously, you seek to transform yourself through fresh ideas.
Your mind is ever young.
 Pluto in Cancer (1914 to 1939): If you were born during these years
when Pluto was discovered, you belong to a generation for whom secu-
rity is paramount. You were taught to hold on to what you’ve got, and
that’s what you do — even when you should know better. It’s no wonder
that you feel this way: The Great Depression of the 1930s was a forma-
tive event in your life or in the experiences of your parents.
 Pluto in Leo (1939 to 1957): Your desire to express yourself dramatically,
creatively, and expansively can become an obsession. This placement
is the trademark of the baby boomers, who look with disdain upon the
130
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

previous generation’s search for security — and who are looked upon
with scorn by the generations that follow because, in true Leo style, you
can’t help showing off.
 Pluto in Virgo (1957 to 1972): The excesses of the baby boomers drive
you to distraction, and you react against them. You seek personal control,
obsess about details, and have every intention of becoming perfect. If you
were born between 1962 and 1969, you also have Uranus in Virgo, so 
unexpected upsets may throw you off track. But these upsets won’t stop
you from striving for the perfect Plutonian/Uranian transformation — 
the one that alters everything in a flash.
 Pluto in Libra (1972 to 1984): You’re obsessed with balance, beauty,
and social relations. You derive great power from sharing, but only
if it’s the real thing. You see no percentage in pretending. On the con-
trary, you demand a true marriage of equals. The arts have a strong
impact on you.
 Pluto in Scorpio (1984 to 1995): You’re passionate, resolute, deeply
sexual, and intent on experiencing every last drop of whatever life has to
offer. But controlling your desires is essential. Fortunately, you have
incredible willpower. You intuitively recognize the link between money
and power, and you’re interested in accumulating both. This is a formi-
dable placement.
 Pluto in Sagittarius (1995 to 2008): You long to find a philosophy or reli-
gion that offers intense spiritual and intellectual experiences — but you
run the risk of being pompous and fanatical. Freedom is essential to you,
and education and travel are transformational.
 Pluto in Capricorn (2008 to 2024): People born with Pluto in buttoned-
down Capricorn are goal-oriented, persistent, and pragmatic, with an
inborn sense of sense of how the world works. You think you’ve seen
savvy politicians? Wait ’til these babies come along. Pluto’s last sojourn
in the sign of the goat was between 1762 and 1778, years that covered
the American Revolution.
 Pluto in Aquarius (2024 to 2044): This do-your-own-thing generation is
likely to have progressive ideals and to seek transformation through
unconventional associations. The group will be increasingly central, but
not in the limited, ethnocentric ways of the past. Remember the amazing
bar scene in the original Star Wars movie? That’s Pluto in Aquarius.
 Pluto in Pisces (2044 to 2068): This placement is bound to be intriguing.
Expect to see a self-sacrificing, mystical generation that dips deep into
the collective unconscious. The members of this group may face a chal-
lenge if external structures dissolve in chaos, as they did in the lifetime
of Abraham Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, both of whom, like other mem-
bers of their generation, had Pluto in Pisces.

Chiron: The Wounded Healer
Is it an asteroid? A burned-out comet? A planetesimal leftover from the cre-
ation of the solar system? An errant moon of Neptune, long since torn away
from its original orbit? Or a particular type of asteroid called a Centaur? Ever
since November 1, 1977, when scientist Charles Kowal discovered Chiron
hurtling around the Sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus, scientists
have been trying to make up their minds. Smaller by far than any planet (its
estimated size is 200 miles across), Chiron has a peculiar orbit that causes it
to spend more time in some signs (Pisces, Aries, and Taurus) than in others
(Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio). A complete swing through all 12 signs of the
zodiac takes 51 years.
In mythology, Chiron was a compassionate tutor whose students included
three heroes: the warrior Achilles, the Argonaut Jason, and Hercules. One day,
Chiron was accidentally scratched by one of Hercules’s poison arrows. The
pain was so intense that he wanted to die. But Chiron was immortal. Unable to
die, he was forced to cope with the agony. In the process, he became expert in
the arts of healing. Yet despite Chiron’s knowledge, his pain never lessened.
Nor did he develop a tolerance for it. He did, however, find a solution. After
negotiating with Zeus, he bequeathed his immortality to Prometheus, who
had given fire to mankind and was being tortured as a result. So Prometheus,
having been freed from his agony, joined the society of the gods on Mount
Olympus while Chiron, relieved of his agony, was allowed to travel into the
underworld, release his bodily pain, and take up residence in Hades.
The symbol for Chiron looks like a letter K balanced on a circle or oval. It
resembles an old-fashioned key.
Chiron’s influence
In the years following its discovery, few practitioners were brave enough to
insert Chiron into birth charts. It seemed too soon, and astrologers didn’t
know enough about it. That has changed. Today, Chiron, referred to as the
Wounded Healer, is often included in interpretations. Astrologers see Chiron
as both a point of pain and a source of healing — an area where you have suf-
fered or been disappointed and where you must find resolution. Astrologers
also associate Chiron with the holistic healing movement.
Note that the astrological Chiron, like the mythological figure, is more than a
victim and a healer. As a tutor, Chiron was known for his wisdom and his
teaching ability. Astrologer Zipporah Dobyns, PhD, links Chiron with
Sagittarius and suggests that it indicates not only the quest for knowledge
but also the impulse to share it with others.
132
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Chiron is small, distant, and impossible to see without a telescope. It’s promi-
nent in your chart if
 It occupies an angle (and especially if it conjuncts or opposes your
Ascendant or Midheaven).
 It closely aspects the Sun, the Moon, or the planet that rules your
Ascendant.
To discover Chiron’s position in your chart, turn to the Appendix, or go to
the Web.
Chiron in the signs
Chiron spends, on average, a little over four years in each sign. Thus it indi-
cates an area of concern both for you and for members of your immediate
generation.
 Chiron in Aries: Your efforts to express your personality have been
thwarted. You suffer from a bad case of fear of failure, and taking the ini-
tiative isn’t easy for you. Finding the courage to do so — and you’ve got
courage aplenty — is the only way to overcome your fears and feelings
of inadequacy.
 Chiron in Taurus: Stability and security are key issues for you. On the
one hand, you long for economic comfort. On the other hand, you strug-
gle to manage your money. To put your desire for material goods and
security into perspective, you need to pursue your deeper values.
 Chiron in Gemini: Communicating your ideas is a challenge, and you
may not feel up to it. Seeking knowledge and acting as an educator
enable you to heal this feeling of inadequacy. And here’s another issue
that may envelope you from time to time: gossip. It’s one way people
learn about each other — and yet it can be lethal.
 Chiron in Cancer: Your domestic life, especially as a child, may be
fraught with pain. Relief comes through consciously seeking to create a
supportive emotional environment. True healing comes through realiz-
ing that ultimately everyone has to nurture themselves.
 Chiron in Leo: In childhood, your efforts to get attention were thwarted,
and you may doubt your own talents as a result. Creative expression
helps heal the hurt. Acting and teaching are also beneficial because,
putting aside whatever sorrows you may have suffered, everyone needs
to be center stage once in a while.
133
Chapter 10: The Outer Planets (Plus One Amazing Asteroid)

 Chiron in Virgo: You grew up with extraordinarily rigid rules. Now you
struggle with anxiety. Seek relief by focusing on wellness, by serving
others without sacrificing yourself, and, above all, by refusing to be a
martyr. Or try another approach entirely by taking up a craft where your
perfectionism — which is so often a problem on the personal level — is
actually rewarded.
 Chiron in Libra: Partnerships are vital to your well-being, but they’re
also disappointing. You’re certain that a healthy relationship can heal
you, and yet that doesn’t seem to happen. Balancing romance with
objective reality is essential. It’s also important to defuse the pain of
rejection. One possible way to do that is through art.
 Chiron in Scorpio: You long for love, passion, and phenomenal sex. But
your secretive ways and deep-seated fear of revealing yourself (and
hence of being rejected) make it difficult to fulfill your desires. Healing
comes by plunging into your sorrows and working your way through
them. Seek psychotherapy or any other form of self-knowledge.
 Chiron in Sagittarius: What’s the purpose of life? The traditional answers
leave you feeling frustrated and alone. A personal search lessens the
pain. Strange as it may seem, lifelong education, designed to fit your
individual requirements, can bring you healing.
 Chiron in Capricorn: In your heart, you long for success. You obey the
rules, but they let you down. Healing comes when you turn away from
society’s rigid definition of status and find other ways to express your
own deepest authority.
 Chiron in Aquarius: What’s wrong with people anyway? You’re sadly
aware of the resoundingly negative impact of ethnic conflict, societal
injustice, and isolation. Addressing those wrongs by working for the
greater good can turn your life around.
 Chiron in Pisces: Pisces is the sign of compassion, sensitivity, and
sacrifice. But you can’t help noticing that many people give lip service
to those qualities without actually practicing them. Your mission: To
see the sorrow and react appropriately without being overwhelmed by
it. Finding a spiritual base can ease your angst.

 Discovering your Midheaven and I.C.
I
used to work at a bookstore with a woman who was so well-organized and
in control that everyone relied on her. She knew what was on the shelves,
what was on order, what was out of print, what was in the back room, and
what was behind the counter. On top of that, she had read everything, includ-
ing the classics that most people don’t even know are classics, and she could
advise the most hard-to-please customer. When she wasn’t around, things fell
to pieces. So I wasn’t surprised when I completed her chart and discovered
that she had Virgo rising. She was as intelligent, organized, and meticulous as
any Virgo I knew.
But rising signs can be deceptive. Sure, on the surface she was detail-oriented
and in control, just like a Virgo. But her Sun was not in Virgo. It was in sensi-
tive, charitable Pisces, the dreamiest, most impressionable sign in the zodiac.
And indeed, that sign described her more fully. She was kind, compassionate,
and imaginative (that’s why she was such an avid reader — she lost herself in
books). She had many devoted friends, a husband she adored, a city loft filled
with original artwork, and a second home — a tiny cottage — on a windswept
island in a distant sea. Her life was suffused with romance, creativity, and
water. But if she had experienced the poetry of Pisces, she also knew the pain
of it. In one form or another, she had coped with everything from a relative in
jail to alcoholism. She was a Pisces down to her toes.
Nonetheless, she looked like a Virgo. That’s because Virgo was her rising sign,
or Ascendant. The Ascendant describes the surface level of your personality. It
is who you appear to be — the surface you present to the world. In the past,

many astrologers considered the Ascendant the most essential part of the
birth chart — even more central than the Sun sign. Today, most astrologers
rank the rising sign, the Sun sign, and the Moon sign as the three most impor-
tant parts of a chart.
The zodiac revolves around the Earth like a gigantic ring. At any given
moment, one sign of the zodiac is rising over the eastern horizon and another
sign is setting in the west; one sign is riding high above you and another sign
is on the opposite side of the planet. Each of these points represents one of
the four main angles of your chart.
The sign on the eastern horizon is your rising sign; the exact degree of that
sign is your Ascendant. The point opposite your rising sign on the western
horizon is the Descendant or setting sign, which is always a full 180° away
from the Ascendant. The degree at the top of your horoscope is the
Midheaven, or M.C., and the degree at the lowest part of your chart, 180°
away from the Midheaven, is the imum coeli, or I.C. Those four points deter-
mine the angles of your horoscope, as shown in Figure 11-1.

Identifying Your Ascendant
It’s a sad fact that figuring out your Ascendant is an arduous process. To do 
it yourself, should you be so inclined, you have to get your hands on the full
collection of astrological gear, including an atlas, a Table of Houses, and an
ephemeris (an almanac listing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets 
for every day of the year). You also need a book to tell you what time zone
you were born in (they’re occasionally relocated, as in Kansas in 1967 or
Nebraska in 1968) and whether you were born during standard time, war
time, daylight saving time, or the unanticipated extra months of daylight
saving time that marked the winter of 1974, when disco ruled and an energy
crisis forced President Richard Nixon to extend the time change.
Alternatively, you could go to the Internet, as described in Chapter 2. That’s
the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable way to get an accurate birth chart. If
going online isn’t an immediate possibility, I recommend that you abandon
the search for precision, at least temporarily, and make an educated guess. 
I tell you how to do that in Chapter 3.
After you’ve identified your Ascendant, either via the Internet or by following
the directions in Chapter 3, I suggest that you double-check it. Begin by copy-
ing the chart on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. Put your rising sign
at the nine o’clock spot. Then write in the other signs in a counterclockwise
direction. (That is, if you’re Taurus rising, put Gemini on the cusp of the
second house at eight o’clock, Cancer on the cusp of the third house at seven
o’clock, and so on.)
The idea is to figure out whether the Ascendant makes sense by comparing
the Sun’s position on your birth chart to its position in the sky at the moment
of your birth. Here’s how: Imagine that the Ascendant/Descendant line, which
runs straight across the chart from nine o’clock to three o’clock, is the hori-
zon of the earth. If you were born around dawn, the Sun was on or near the
horizon. Its symbol in your chart should also be near the Ascendant, perhaps
in the same sign. If you were born around noon, the Sun sits near the top of
your chart in the ninth or tenth house. If you were born around dusk, when
the Sun was setting, the Sun in your chart is once again on the horizon, this
time in the sixth or seventh house, near the Descendant. And if you were a
midnight delivery, the Sun lies below the horizon, in the third or fourth house.
What Your Ascendant Says about You
The Ascendant describes the surface of your personality. It’s your image,
your persona, your mask, your vibe. Or think of it this way: Your rising sign is
137
Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)

like the clothes you wear; those outfits aren’t exactly you, but they aren’t
irrelevant either. They convey a powerful, unspoken message to others —
and even you may come to associate them with your deeper self.
 Aries rising: You’re active, assertive, adventurous, headstrong, and
sometimes accident-prone. Reckless and extroverted, with an abun-
dance of energy, you invigorate everyone around you. You take pride —
for good reason — in your ability to get things moving. When you know
what you want, you go after it boldly. But you can also be competitive
and insensitive. You have a tendency to take over. And when obstacles
block your path, your patience (which is never your high card) may
evaporate. You love to be there at the start of an enterprise when the
excitement is building. Later on is another story.
Regardless of your Sun sign, your ruler is Mars, the warrior planet. Its
location by sign and by house (as well as the aspects it makes to other
planets) describes your energy level and the nature of your desires.
 Taurus rising: You’re warm, generous, loyal, and a delight to be around,
even if you’re slow to open up and resistant to change. There’s some-
thing reassuring and calming about your steady presence. You’re prag-
matic and patient — a reasonable person who doesn’t let little things get
to you. At the same time, you’re affectionate and pleasure-loving, with a
deep appreciation of food, drink, art, and the pleasures of the body. You
care about appearances — and you aren’t indifferent to money either. It
brings you the security you need.
Regardless of your Sun sign, your ruler is Venus, the planet of love and
attraction. Its location by sign and by house (as well as the aspects it
makes with other planets) describes the role of love, art, and beauty in
your life.

The Wife of Bath
When astrologers analyze literary characters,
they’re usually forced to intuit what their birth
dates may be. Occasionally, an author pre-
sents the essential information. Geoffrey
Chaucer, for example, clearly knew his astrol-
ogy. In his Canterbury Tales, he explained the
Wife of Bath’s bawdy behavior as the natural
result of having a Taurus Ascendant with
Mars, the planet of desire, in the same lusty
sign. Don’t let the 14th-century English stop
you from enjoying her own explanation of her
lascivious ways:
Myn ascendent was Taur and Mars
therinne —
Allas, allas, the evere love was sinne!
I folwed ay my inclinacioun
By vertu of my constellacioun;
That made my I coude nought withdrawe
My chambre of Venus from a good felawe.
So who are the real-life people with Taurus
rising and Mars therein? Janet Jackson is one.
Barbara LaMarr is another. LaMarr, an actress
from the days of silent films, married six times
before her death from drug abuse at age 29.

 Gemini rising: You’re talkative, excitable, funny, possibly an insomniac,
and ever youthful. You pick up information in a flash and quickly adapt
to changing circumstances (even if you also like to complain about
them). You have a curious mind and may have writing ability. But you’re
restless, nervous, and easily bored, with a tendency to scatter your
energy. It soothes your anxious mind to have two of everything: two best
friends, two part-time jobs, two of your favorite pens, two books you’re
in the middle of reading.
No matter what your Sun sign is, your ruler is Mercury, the planet of
communication. Its position by sign and by house, along with the
aspects it makes to other planets, describes the way you speak, the way
you learn, and the way your mind works.
 Cancer rising: Moody, sensitive, and imaginative, you live at a high emo-
tional pitch. You’re attuned to other people and skilled at nurturing and
protecting them, yet you may feel drained by their needs and resentful
of their requests. You’re shrewd and ambitious, but your carefully drawn
plans may crumble in the face of your emotional reactions. When you
feel besieged by the needs (or criticism) of others, you withdraw into
the privacy of your shell. Home, food, family, and financial well-being are
essential to your peace of mind.
The ever-changing Moon is your ruling planet, no matter what your Sun
sign may be. By house, by sign, and by aspect, it describes your emo-
tions and instincts.
 Leo rising: You’re flashy, fun-loving, charismatic, and friendly. The very
opposite of a wallflower, you can’t stand not being noticed. You have
great personal pride. You do your best to appear lighthearted and confi-
dent, and you usually succeed. You’re the life of the party — and more.
You also have unmistakable leadership ability. You’re empathetic, with a
benevolent heart and a noble desire to make life better for other people.
No wonder they want to bask in your glow.
The Sun is your ruling planet, regardless of the sign of the zodiac you
were born under. It represents your essential self and your vitality,
which is enhanced by having a Leo Ascendant.
 Virgo rising: A natural conversationalist, you have a quick, incisive mind
and a thoughtful, controlled demeanor. Methodical and articulate, with
an ability to juggle details that astounds the rest of the world, you com-
municate effectively, pick up knowledge effortlessly, and are highly
observant (which is one reason you’re so much fun to talk to). You make
a concerted effort to engage with the world on a mental level, but emo-
tional displays make you want to hide. Despite what you may think, your
efforts to keep your feelings hidden aren’t always successful. You have a
tendency to worry about your health.
Regardless of your Sun sign, your ruler is Mercury, the planet of commu-
nication. Its position by sign, by house, and by aspect, describes your
thinking process and the way you communicate.
139
Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)

 Libra rising: You’re engaging, tactful, charming, refined, attractive, and
easy to be around. But you have an intense need for harmony, which
means you can’t bear to be in a hostile environment (and you may disen-
gage if you find yourself in one). You’re also artistic and intellectually
engaged, with a powerful sense of justice and a need for balance (that’s
what those scales are about). Partnerships, romantic and otherwise, are
essential to you.
No matter what your Sun sign is, your ruler is Venus, the planet of love
and attraction. Its position in your chart by house, sign, and aspect, is
central to who you are.
 Scorpio rising: Traditional astrology claims that the Ascendant deter-
mines appearance. To my eye, that influence is usually a subtle one —
with one exception: Scorpio rising. Dark or light, your intense eyes and
personal magnetism draw people to you. You’re compelling, mysterious,
and sexy, with a strong sense of privacy and often a deep well of pain
that can occasionally cause you to lash out. Despite whatever pain you
may have experienced in the past, you’re a survivor who takes control in
periods of crisis. You have persuasive ability, plenty of willpower, and
the ability to transform yourself, both internally and externally.
Regardless of your Sun sign, the ruler of your chart is Pluto. And don’t
let anyone tell you that Pluto is “just” a dwarf planet. Pluto rules
destruction, transformation, and nuclear power. He doesn’t have to be
big. You should also know that two planets are credited with dominion
over Scorpio: Pluto, the ruler of modern times, and Mars, the traditional
ruler. By sign, house, and aspect, both planets play leading roles in your
chart.

Scorpio rising aliases
Some people born with Scorpio rising can’t help
playing around with their own identity. Examples
include writer Mary Anne Evans, who published
under the name George Eliot; Samuel Clemens,
who wrote as Mark Twain; Washington Irving (of
Rip van Winkle fame) whose aliases included
Dietrich Knickerbocker and Geoffrey Crayon;
Prince Rogers Nelson, who changed his name to
a symbol and became The Artist Formerly Known
as Prince; the spy Mata Hari; Grace Kelly, who
gave up the glamorous life of a Hollywood star to
become the Princess of Monaco; Jacqueline
Kennedy, who left the country after the assassi-
nation of her husband and became Jackie O;
David Berkowitz, the murderer who dubbed him-
self “Son of Sam;” and the chameleon-like
comedian Tracey Ullman, whose many alter egos
are of all races, genders, ages, and opinions.
Why do they do it? Ask Sigmund Freud. Like other
people with Scorpio rising, he too was fasci-
nated by the mystery of identity — and the power
of secrets.

 Sagittarius rising: You’re outgoing, restless, and reckless. In your opti-
mistic search for a larger, more exciting life, you cultivate people from
many backgrounds, travel as widely as possible, immerse yourself in all
kinds of philosophical systems (be they religious, academic, or profes-
sional), and can get all wound up over an idea. Witty and excitable,
you’re a lucky person with a breezy personality, many friends, and an
independent attitude. When opportunities come your way, you grab
them instinctively. But it’s difficult for you to sacrifice your freedom for
external demands, and you suffer when constrained.
It doesn’t matter what your month of birth is — Jupiter, the planet of
expansion, is your ruler. Its position by house, by sign, and by aspect,
indicates areas of good fortune and opportunity.
 Capricorn rising: Chaos makes you crazy. You’re serious, reserved, reli-
able, and determined, with a method for everything. Ambitious and com-
petitive, you prefer to work within an established system. You wield
authority effectively and have a strong sense of ethics. You may be rigid
and prone to depression, and learning to relax can be a challenge. Though
your childhood may have been difficult, your outlook improves as you age
(and thanks to your healthy habits, you maintain a youthful appearance).
Saturn, the planet of discipline, is your ruler, regardless of your Sun sign.
Its position by house, by sign, and by aspect, points to areas where you
have to pay your dues, face down your fears, and create structures in
order to achieve your potential.
 Aquarius rising: You have dozens of interests, legions of friends, and a
cool, amiable personality. But you maintain a certain distance that can
make you seem disinterested or remote, and you’re unwilling to limit
your options for the comfort of others. If you strike other people as will-
ful or eccentric, well, that’s their problem. Unexpected events, especially
in childhood, made you wary and conscious of the need to protect your-
self. More than that, you resist change and authority. Why should
anyone else have power over you? You can’t think of a single reason.
141
Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)
My friend Howard
Outgoing Leos are a dime a dozen. Hermit Leos,
like my friend Howard, are a rarity. He seldom
leaves the house, but when he does, he’s as
witty and entertaining as they get, and I don’t
say that just because he’s my friend. So how
come he shies away from relationships and
prefers to stay home, nursing his modem? It’s
because he has Capricorn rising with stern
Saturn, his ruling planet, occupying the same
degree of the zodiac as his Sun. So he’s a wor-
rier, he’s inflexible, and he expects the worst. No
wonder he stays home.

Rebellious Uranus, planet of the unexpected, is your ruler, regardless of
your Sun sign. Before its discovery in 1781, astrologers assigned sover-
eignty of Aquarius to another ruler: Saturn, the planet of limitation and
self-discipline. By sign, by house, and by aspect, both planets play pow-
erful roles in your chart.
 Pisces rising: You’re romantic, impressionable, sentimental, kind, and so
empathetic that sometimes just being around unhappy people is more
than you can tolerate. Moody and idealistic, you have powerful artistic
and psychic abilities. At your most self-actualizing, you can mobilize
your inner forces and turn daydreams into realities. But when wishful
thinking gets out of hand, you can be gullible, passive, and too submis-
sive for your own good. I’m sorry to say that substance abuse is a
danger for you. Fortunately, you also have a yearning for creative and
spiritual fulfillment that can keep you on track.
Elusive Neptune, the planet of inspiration, is your ruler, no matter what
your Sun sign is. Its position in your chart by house, by sign, and by
aspect, indicates an area of ideals, creativity, and spiritual fulfillment.
You also have a co-ruler: Jupiter, the planet associated with Pisces prior
to the discovery of Neptune in 1846.
Finding and Understanding
Your Descendant
After you’ve identified your rising sign, you automatically know your
Descendant, no calculation required. By definition, the Descendant is always
exactly opposite your rising sign. For example, if you have Cancer rising, your
Descendant is Capricorn.
A less powerful point than your Ascendant, the Descendant determines the
approach you take toward marriage and partnerships. It describes the nature
of those relationships in your life, and it indicates the kind of person you’re
likely to fall for. What’s your type? Your Descendant provides the answer:
 If you have Aries rising: Your Descendant is in Libra. Your ideal rela-
tionship is egalitarian, and your perfect partner, unlike yourself, is
poised and balanced, a force for harmony — the very quality you need
the most.
 If you have Taurus rising: Your Descendant is Scorpio. Your best possible
partner is sexually passionate, emotionally intense, and fully willing to
engage in intimate conversation. You probably don’t think you want some-
one who’s secretive or manipulative. The evidence suggests otherwise.
142
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 If you have Gemini rising: Your Descendant is Sagittarius, which sug-
gests that the best partner for you is an independent person of strong
beliefs who can expand your world. You romanticize relationships and
may marry more than once. But since when is that a crime?
 If you have Cancer rising: Your Descendant is Capricorn, which means
that you seek a solid relationship with a partner who’s serious, protec-
tive, and reliable — an older or more established person who can give
you the security you need.
 If you have Leo rising: Your Descendant is Aquarius, which means that
although you may think that you want a dazzling, swashbuckling com-
panion, your ideal mate is actually a unique and stimulating freethinker
with whom you feel a lively mental connection.
 If you have Virgo rising: Your Descendant is Pisces, which suggests that
your ideal partner is a sympathetic, adaptable person who can help you
stop that crazy worrying thing you do. You may dream of someone as
organized and efficient as yourself. Notice how you keep not getting it?
There’s a reason: It’s not what you need.
 If you have Libra rising: Your Descendant is Aries, which suggests that
the ideal mate for you is someone with an independent streak and a fiery
personality who can stir up your enthusiasms, energize you, and help
you deal with conflict.
 If you have Scorpio rising: Your Descendant is Taurus. The most natural
partner for you is down-to-earth, trustworthy, and stubborn enough to
resist your considerable blandishments. You may think you want some-
one who’s spicy, complicated, and hot (like yourself). Actually, you’d be
better off with someone who’s as straightforward and nourishing as a
fresh loaf of bread.
 If you have Sagittarius rising: Your Descendant is Gemini, suggesting that
you may postpone commitment out of a fear of being tied down. When
you do find the courage, the proper partner for you is an active, multifac-
eted person whose conversation is so stimulating that you’re never bored.
 If you have Capricorn rising: Your Descendant is Cancer, which means
that you need a warm, supportive mate who can soften you up by giving
you the security (and the home-cooked meals) you crave. Traditional
relationships are best for you.
 If you have Aquarius rising: Your Descendant is fiery Leo, suggesting
that a relationship offering Leo’s passion, vivacity, and personal devotion
would counter your airy objectivity and bring you satisfaction. A little
pizazz on your partner’s side goes a long way to keeping you interested.
 If you have Pisces rising: Your Descendant is Virgo, which suggests that
a mate who’s practical, analytical, and meticulous with details would
balance your intuitive, dreamy approach to life and help reduce the
chaos that you create — or attract — without even half trying.
143
Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)

Looking Into Your Midheaven and I.C.
How come some people grow up in ordinary circumstances and yet end up in
the strangest careers? The Midheaven, also known as the M.C. (from the
Latin medium coeli, meaning “middle of the heavens”), frequently explains it.
(Other factors in your choice of career include planets in the tenth house, the
planet that rules your Midheaven, and planets in the sixth house of work.)
The Midheaven is the highest point on the ecliptic and in your chart. It doesn’t
determine your talents, but it affects your public persona and influences the
approach you take to authority, status, and career. The M.C. also says a lot
about one of your parents. Which one? Some astrologers think it refers to the
mother, others to the opposite-sex parent, still others to the most influential
parent. In short, it’s definitely one or the other. You choose.
Directly opposite the Midheaven is the I.C., or imum coeli (from the Latin
imum coeli, meaning “lowest part of the heavens”). The I.C. influences your
attitude toward home and family, affects the circumstances at the end of your
life, and, like the M.C., is associated with one of your parents. It’s sometimes
described as representing the “base of the personality,” which suggests that
its importance is greater than it appears.
If you have an accurate copy of your birth chart, you can find your
Midheaven on or near the cusp of the tenth house at the twelve o’clock spot.
If you’re using the material in this book to determine your Ascendant (see
Chapter 3), assume that your Midheaven is in the same sign that appears on
the cusp of the tenth house. Either way, your I.C. is directly opposite the
M.C., at or near the lowest point of your chart.
The easiest way to get an accurate copy of your chart is to go on the Internet.
Free charts are available from www.alabe.com, www.astro.com, or www.
chaosastrology.com.
The Midheaven affects your attitude toward career. The I.C. affects your atti-
tude toward home and family.
 Aries Midheaven: You have a daring attitude toward your career. You
respond to a challenge and are most jazzed when you’re launching a new
endeavor. You don’t mind taking a risk. What you do mind is being pow-
erless. Being your own boss is your best move.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Mars.
Your I.C. is in Libra, indicating that while you may be willing to fight in
the professional world, you need a serene and harmonious home. Take
the advice of Aries artist William Morris in The Beauty of Life: “Have
144
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to
be beautiful.” And if in doubt as to which matters more — usefulness or
beauty — go for the latter.
 Taurus Midheaven: Security matters. You need to do something tangible
in your career — and whatever it is, you need to receive substantial
rewards. Fortunately, you have the stamina to make it happen.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Venus, suggesting that artistic areas
may appeal to you.
Your I.C. is in Scorpio, which suggests that your home is a hideaway
where you can express your deepest passions and find the privacy
you crave.
 Gemini Midheaven: In your career, you require diversity, intellectual
stimulation, and the ability to fulfill your curiosity. Writing is favored, as
is anything involving other forms of communication. You also benefit
from the chance to take frequent jaunts out of the office. You don’t need
to go far — you just need to go out.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Mercury.
Your I.C. is Sagittarius, which suggests that you move frequently (or
would like to), that your domestic life is shaped by strong religious prin-
ciples, or that you secretly long to be an expatriate. You agree with the
Gemini writer G. K. Chesterton, who wrote in What’s Wrong with the
World, “The home is not the one tame place in a world of adventure; it is
the one wild place in a world of rules and set tasks.”
 Cancer Midheaven: You need a career where you can use your intuition
and make emotional connections. Your stated purpose may be to pro-
vide security for your family, but you also need to be involved in the
wider community and to receive recognition from authority figures
there.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is the Moon.
Your I.C. is Capricorn, which suggests that you have traditional taste
in interior decoration and that you take a conservative attitude
toward family, an arena in which you shoulder an enormous burden
of responsibility.
 Leo Midheaven: You need a career that provides room for creative
expression, opportunities for leadership, and public recognition. Your
pride is on the line here, so the more acknowledgment you receive for
your professional efforts, the happier you will be.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is the Sun.
Your I.C. is Aquarius, which indicates that you have an idiosyncratic atti-
tude toward home and family. As a result, there’s something unusual
about your domestic life — and about one of your parents as well.
145
Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)

 Virgo Midheaven: Whatever your career (or community activities) may
be, you succeed because you do your homework and pay attention to
the small stuff. You work hard, and people come to rely on you. Still, you
may feel that you don’t receive the recognition you deserve. Keep in
mind that Virgo is the sign of the martyr, and resist the temptation to
torture yourself.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Mercury.
Your I.C. is Pisces, which indicates that feelings of abandonment in child-
hood make you long for a serene home filled with spiritual solace. Your
attitude is that of the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard, who wrote
in The Poetics of Space, “If I were asked to name the chief benefit of the
house, I should say: The house shelters day-dreaming, the house pro-
tects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.”
 Libra Midheaven: You want a pleasant, rational career that enables you
to balance your public and private lives. Ideally, you’d enjoy a career in
the arts or one that includes plenty of socializing. You easily attract
people who can help you reach your goals.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Venus.

Björk
Is it fair to say that the Icelandic singer/composer/
performer Björk, an experimental artist who has
been in the public eye since childhood, presents
a supremely weird and riveting image? I think it is.
What makes her unique are the two major angles
of her chart: her Ascendant, which describes her
persona, and the Midheaven, or M.C., which rep-
resents her career. In her case, each angle is
conjunct one or more of the weighty outer plan-
ets. Her Ascendant, like her Sun and Moon, is in
Scorpio, making her a triple Scorpio — an intense
combination of influences. Closest to her Ascen-
dant is Neptune, the planet of fantasy and illusion.
Its prominence boosts her musical creativity. Its
presence in the first house makes it easy for her
to alter her image and play with her appearance
in highly imaginative ways. She’s no doubt a
shape-shifter. What else would make her don her
infamous swan dress, which looked like a cross
between a dead bird and a 1980s pouf skirt? 
In classic Neptunian style, the meaning was 
indecipherable and the alluring strangeness
unforgettable.
Equally important in her chart is a three-way
conjunction of transformative Pluto, unpredict-
able Uranus, and the M.C. These heavy-duty
placements suggest that she’s a risk-taker with
a compelling need to change the world in uncon-
ventional ways. As for her parents, they’re pow-
erful people in their own right (her father, a labor
leader, was famous in Iceland before she was)
and their influence on her is huge.

Your I.C. is Aries, suggesting that you can renew your energy and
express your individuality most actively at home. But you can also be
rebellious and short-tempered with members of your family.
 Scorpio Midheaven: You gravitate toward a career that offers you the
opportunity to feel intensely and perhaps to exercise authority. Once
you set your mind on a goal, you’re determined to achieve it. But you
can tie yourself in knots over the emotional complexity of your world,
and you’re always aware of the political undercurrents.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Pluto.
Your I.C. is Taurus, suggesting that financial security and the comforts of
family are extremely important to you. Owning a home and land brings
you satisfaction.
 Sagittarius Midheaven: You’re happiest with a career that offers inde-
pendence, the opportunity to broaden your mental horizons, and plenty
of frequent-flyer miles. Within your profession or community, you’re
known for your high ideals and powerful beliefs. You have a tendency to
idealize the people you work with (or for). And although you benefit
from your encounters with authority figures, they may rub you the
wrong way anyway.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Jupiter.
Your I.C. is Gemini, suggesting that your home is a busy place filled with
books, magazines, and communication devices of every sort. You’d love
to have two homes and you may move frequently.
 Capricorn Midheaven: Reliable and ambitious, you’re willing to do
whatever is necessary to achieve the success you wish for. Major
responsibilities regularly end up on your salad plate. Secretly, you’re
complimented by the responsibility. To maintain optimism, you need
clear signs of progress — things like promotions, raises, and a corner
office with a ficus tree. You do well in a corporate environment.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Saturn.
Your I.C. is Cancer, suggesting that your ties to family in general, and
your mother in particular, are strong. Living near water soothes you.
 Aquarius Midheaven: Your attitude toward career and community is
unconventional and unique — and so is your ideal career. Because your
skills are utterly unique, your ideal job is shaped to you personally. You
do well in forward-looking, progressive areas that provide benefits to the
public.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Uranus.
Your I.C. is Leo. You take pride in your home, which is a place where you
can express your emotions and your creative talents. Even if you’re shy
elsewhere, you’re the star at home.

Chapter 11: What You See versus What You Get: The Rising Sign (And More)

 Pisces Midheaven: Compassion and/or imagination determine your
career choices. You may be drawn to the helping professions or to an
expressive field, such as music or dance. Either way, your intuition and
psychic abilities guide you.
The planet ruling your Midheaven is Neptune.
Your I.C. is Virgo, suggesting that a clean, neat environment at home
gives you the security and grounding that you need. You may move fre-
quently, always in search of an ideal home.

C
onsider two babies born on July 6, 1935, one around 4 a.m. local time
and one, in another part of the world, around 6 a.m. Their planets are in
identical signs of the zodiac. But their rising signs (see Chapter 11) aren’t the
same, and neither are their house placements. How much difference would
that make?
It would make a world of difference. One child, born with Gemini rising,
Mercury on the Ascendant, and the Sun in the first house, is Candy Barr,
the platinum-haired stripper who died in 2005. The other, born with Cancer
rising, Pluto on the Ascendant, and the Sun in the twelfth house, is the Dalai
Lama. This stark difference suggests how crucial the rising sign and house
placements can be. They’re as important as sign placements.
Unfortunately, it’s easy to confuse the signs with the houses. One difference
is that the signs, which are divisions of the ecliptic, represent various atti-
tudes, styles, and approaches to life. The houses describe areas of interest
such as money, children, health, partnership, travel, and education. In every
horoscope, each planet is in a sign and a house. In this chapter, I discuss the
twelve houses and offer interpretations for each planet in each house.
The planets represent types of energy, the signs represent various ways of
expressing that energy, and the houses represent different areas of experience
where those energies are likely to operate. House placements are based on the
time of your birth, not on your sign. For instance, if you were born shortly

before dawn, your Sun is in the first house — no matter whether you were
born in January or in June. To figure out your houses, get a copy of your chart
online (check out Chapter 2 for details), or flip to Chapter 3 (which tells you
how to set up your chart using the tables in this book). And I’m sorry to
report that if you don’t have a birth time that’s at least fairly accurate (within
an hour at the most), you may as well skip this chapter.
Taking the House Tour
Every birth chart embraces all twelve houses — no more, no less. In most
charts, one or two of those houses prove to be especially important thanks
to the presence of several planets. The more planets you find squeezed into a
house, the more important the matters of that house are likely to be. Table
12-1 lists the twelve houses along with the areas of life that they cover.

Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

The Sun in the Houses
The Sun symbolizes your will, your purpose, and your most essential self. Its
house position describes the area in which you can most effectively express
those aspects of your being.
 Sun in the first house: You’re active, enterprising, and proud of your
accomplishments. Your strong personality enables you to assert your-
self in a natural, dignified way. This placement indicates leadership
potential and success that comes about through your own efforts.
 Sun in the second house: You’re practical, persistent, interested in
money, and skilled at judging the value of things. Your possessions
reflect your deeper values. Achieving financial stability gives you great
satisfaction.
 Sun in the third house: Curious and observant, you collect information
and communicate with ease, both in speech and in writing. Travel and
siblings play important roles in your life.
 Sun in the fourth house: You’re intuitive and introverted, with a strong
sense of self, a close tie to your ancestors, and an interest in the past.
Home and family are of primary importance. Finding your roots is essen-
tial to your sense of self.
 Sun in the fifth house: Pleasure-seeking and dynamic, you find happi-
ness through romance, children, and activities that give you the oppor-
tunity to express yourself in dramatic, creative ways.
 Sun in the sixth house: Finding fulfilling work is essential because you
devote yourself to your job and define yourself through it. Though you
worry about your health, it’s usually good. Regardless of your Sun sign,
you tend to be a perfectionist.
 Sun in the seventh house: Marriage and other partnerships are essen-
tial to your identity, though you may bounce back and forth between
fear of isolation and fear of commitment. Balancing power is an issue in
both personal and professional relationships.
 Sun in the eighth house: You’re a profoundly emotional person whose
need to explore the mystery of your own psyche brings liberation and
transformation. Sex, money, and legacies of all types play a major role in
your life.
 Sun in the ninth house: You’re a lifelong seeker who looks to find meaning
and to expand your awareness through education, religion, and travel.
Everyone talks about having a philosophy of life. You really mean it.
 Sun in the tenth house: Your determination to succeed and your desire
for public recognition make you a born leader — and are excellent indi-
cators of professional success.
151
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Sun in the eleventh house: You have high ideals and aspirations, many
friends, a wide circle of acquaintances, and the ability to work well in a
group. Indeed, becoming part of a group that expresses your most cher-
ished values enables you to fulfill your deepest goals. Friends can be the
most important people in your life.
 Sun in the twelfth house: Intuitive, reclusive, and secretive, you find
nourishment in solitude and spiritual activity. You may also become
involved in helping others, perhaps through large institutions, such as
hospitals or prisons.
The Moon in the Houses
The house that the Moon occupies in your chart determines the area of life in
which you react most instinctively. This same area is one in which you may
experience all kinds of fluctuations. Yet your emotional well-being depends
on the concerns of that house.
 Moon in the first house: Don’t imagine that your emotions are hidden or
disguised in any way. Thanks to your unconscious need to express your
feelings and be accepted, they’re obvious to all. Your well-being is oddly
dependent on your appearance and how people perceive you.
 Moon in the second house: Although you experience financial ups and
downs throughout your life, you also become increasingly persistent
about holding on to the green stuff — which is fortunate, because mater-
ial security is vital for your well-being. You may not think of yourself as a
materialistic person; nonetheless, money matters.
 Moon in the third house: You have an adaptable, curious mind, a strong
attachment to brothers and sisters, and a gift for establishing connec-
tions and linking people together. You’re a skilled communicator, both in
conversation and writing. In a thoroughly nonscientific survey done with
a very small population base, two out of three literary agents of my
acquaintance turn out to have the Moon in this position. (The other has
several planets in Gemini, the sign most similar to the third house.)
 Moon in the fourth house: Your parents and family heritage are pro-
foundly important to you, and the past has an irresistible allure. Security
improves your peace of mind, and having a home that feels right is
essential, although it may not be easy to find. In your search for the per-
fect nest, you’re likely to experience many changes of residence.
 Moon in the fifth house: You’re romantic, dramatic, and emotional.
You’re also creative and talented, perhaps in more than one field. A risk-
taker, especially in the realm of love, you connect easily with children,
whether they’re your own or someone else’s. (The most stimulating
teachers I know have this position.)
152
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Moon in the sixth house: Until you find satisfying work, you’re likely to
change jobs repeatedly. Working for the money isn’t enough; you need to
feel productive and fulfilled. Service and health professions are satisfy-
ing. Also, you worry about your health, which can be affected by your
reactions to your job.
 Moon in the seventh house: Marriage and other partnerships loom large
for you, though you may feel indecisive about relationships. Once you’re
committed, you run the risk of becoming too dependent. In business,
people seek you out.
 Moon in the eighth house: You have strongly fluctuating moods, power-
ful sexual urges, and the ability to heal emotional wounds for yourself
and possibly for others. You’re emotionally brave and willing to face
reality. Financially, you may experience ups and downs, especially
through a romantic relationship.
 Moon in the ninth house: The more you push beyond the boundaries of
your life and seek out fresh experiences, the happier you are. You have
an active imagination and a desire for knowledge. You may explore many
religions and philosophies before you find one that satisfies you. Travel
soothes your soul, and you take many journeys.
 Moon in the tenth house: Your peace of mind goes hand in hand with
your professional accomplishments. Once you identify the right career,
you pour yourself into it. Not surprisingly, your private life may suffer.
The good news is that if you love what you’re doing, you don’t care.
 Moon in the eleventh house: Popular and easygoing, you have an
instinctive understanding of other people and a remarkable capacity for
friendship. Friends play a major role in your life (though you may care
too much about what they think). Your goals are likely to change many
times, and as they do, your circle of friends may also shift.
153
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses
Walt Whitman
The poet Walt Whitman, born May 31, 1819, had
the Moon in Leo in the sixth house. As a Gemini,
he’s known for his writing. As someone with the
Moon in the house of work and health, he’s also
recognized for regular jobs he held during his
lifetime. Among other professions, he was a
journeyman printer, a journalist, a teacher, a
government clerk, and a Civil War nurse, a job
that was both dramatic, in keeping with the Leo
placement of his moon, and service-oriented, as
the sixth house demands.

 Moon in the twelfth house: Digging out your secrets is no easy task.
You’re moody, sensitive, and intrigued by the hidden side of life.
Withdrawal is your mode. You prefer to conceal your emotions
(along with certain sordid episodes from the past). You may become
involved with institutions such as hospitals or prisons. Clandestine
relationships may offer a form of emotional sustenance that you don’t
find elsewhere.
The Nodes of the Moon in the Houses
Unlike the other celestial bodies I discuss in this chapter, the Nodes of the
Moon don’t exactly exist. They’re simply the points in space where the path
of the Moon crosses the ecliptic. Nonetheless, there they are in your chart:
The North Node and the South Node, two sensitive spots carrying a message
that some astrologers consider the most vital part of your horoscope.
Though astrologers have long debated the meaning of the Nodes, they basi-
cally agree that the North Node represents personal growth and illuminates the
path to fulfillment, while the South Node symbolizes patterns established in
previous lifetimes and thus represents the path of least resistance. To interpret
the Nodes, consider their position by sign, by aspect, and most of all, by house.
 North Node in the first house/South Node in the seventh: You find fulfill-
ment by expressing your personality. You stand still by surrendering your
power to others and becoming too dependent (particularly on a spouse).
 North Node in the second house/South Node in the eighth: Pursuing
financial security through your own efforts and in accordance with your
core values brings fulfillment. Relying on others to take care of you, even
through inheritance, brings disappointment, as do relationships that are
entirely about sex.
 North Node in the third house/South Node in the ninth: Gathering
information and using it for concrete purposes brings fulfillment; setting
up a permanent residence in the airy realms of academia brings frustra-
tion. Teaching primary school, pursuing journalism, and getting involved
in neighborhood activities bring benefits; philosophical and religious
musings, though enjoyable, do not.
 North Node in the fourth house/South Node in the tenth: Look to
family, tradition, and inner life for fulfillment. Don’t expect it from the
outside world. Though you may find success in a career, your greatest
joy comes from getting in touch with your roots.
 North Node in the fifth house/South Node in the eleventh: Romance,
children, and creative expression expand your awareness and bring ful-
fillment. Beware of pointless socializing — you lose your soul in the
social whirl. Spiritually speaking, group activities lead nowhere.
154
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 North Node in the sixth house/South Node in the twelfth: Satisfying
work is essential to your personal development, as is a positive
approach to health. Solitude and escapism limit you: Don’t be a hermit.
 North Node in the seventh house/South Node in the first: Accepting
the challenge of relationship and becoming an equal partner benefits
you. Cooperation speeds your progress. Focusing on personal or selfish
concerns slows you down.
 North Node in the eighth house/South Node in the second: You
overemphasize the importance of money and material security. Instead,
look for opportunities to collaborate and form intimate ties with others.
 North Node in the ninth house/South Node in the third: You tend to
run around in a frenzy, gossiping and accumulating facts rather than
ideas. Broaden your horizons by pursuing large ideas and philosophies.
Higher education and world travel benefit you. Playing Sudoku doesn’t.
Don’t get lost in trivial pursuits. Expand your mind.
 North Node in the tenth house/South Node in the fourth: Though it
may scare you, you long for public recognition. Pursuing your career
brings personal growth. Devoting yourself solely to home and family,
though tempting, doesn’t.
 North Node in the eleventh house/South Node in the fifth: Your ten-
dency to focus on love affairs, personal pleasures, and children limits
your development. Take a larger view. Align yourself with others in pur-
suit of a cause: Become political and develop a social conscience.
 North Node in the twelfth house/South Node in the sixth: Work comes
your way and occasionally threatens to overwhelm you. Office politics
sap your energy. Solitude, yoga, and the quest for spiritual transcendence
strengthen you. Don’t be a workaholic. And don’t forget to meditate.
Mercury in the Houses
Mercury is the planet of communication. Its position by house suggests those
areas in life that most absorb your mind and stimulate your thoughts.
 Mercury in the first house: You’re a talker. You’re on the ball, loqua-
cious, and happy to share your views. You may be a gregarious story-
teller, the sort of person who becomes the heart and soul of any dinner
party. Even if you’re not outgoing, you rise to the occasion when giving a
speech. Your ability to communicate is one of your strengths, and it
draws people to you.
 Mercury in the second house: You value results. By taking a systematic
approach and thinking in practical terms, you can turn an idea to con-
crete advantage. You can also earn money by writing.
155
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Mercury in the third house: You’re fortunate to possess this much-
admired placement, for it gives you an alert and vibrant mind, great
intellectual curiosity, and a way with words. You’re an effective public
speaker, a lively conversationalist, and a gifted writer.
 Mercury in the fourth house: Strongly influenced by your parents, you
turn your home into a center of activity and intellectual stimulation. You
may even work at home. Your family heritage is probably complicated in
one way or another, and you must eventually deal with its repercussions
head-on. At your worst, you can be narrow-minded and priggish. At your
best, you’re tuned in and acutely aware.
 Mercury in the fifth house: A fun-loving person with a variety of inter-
ests, you’re a creative thinker with a weakness for speculation and a
romantic history worth writing about. In love, you look for someone who
gets you going mentally. As a parent, you derive enormous pleasure from
your children (and you talk about them endlessly).
 Mercury in the sixth house: Skillful and efficient, you tend to immerse
yourself in work, either handling the details with ease or becoming
obsessed with them. In the absence of something important to do,
you’re the master of make-work — so it’s essential that you find satisfy-
ing, stimulating employment. An apprehensive person, you worry need-
lessly and may become a hypochondriac. To ward off this possibility,
take positive steps to guard your health.
 Mercury in the seventh house: You’re a sociable person who craves
lively conversation and stimulating relationships. Although you’re out-
going and connect easily with others, you quickly become bored and
may shy away from commitment. When you find the relationship you’re
seeking, the conversation never ends.
 Mercury in the eighth house: This placement gives you a naturally intu-
itive mind, the ability to ferret out secrets, amazing researching skills,
and a profound mental engagement with the mysteries of life, including
sex, death, money (which you resent having to worry about), and the
metaphysical arts.
 Mercury in the ninth house: You’re fortified by ideas, motivated by phi-
losophy, stimulated by the forces of the intellect, and happy to explore
the world. You enjoy grappling with ideas and meeting people, which
makes education a natural field for you. (Other smart choices include
law, publishing, and religion.) You find contentment in dealing with
important issues but have no patience for the trivia of everyday life.
 Mercury in the tenth house: With this high-profile placement, you’re
likely to develop a stimulating career, often involving the written word.
Your ideal job has great variety built into it. In the absence of that, you
experience frequent job changes. You require continued mental stimula-
tion. You prefer to be in charge and are most successful when you can
pursue your own ideas.
156
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Mercury in the eleventh house: An active social life is essential for your
well-being. You make friends easily, but if Mercury is afflicted by stress-
ful aspects with other planets, there can be a revolving-door quality to
your friendships. (See Chapter 13 for a discussion of aspects.) You find it
simulating to work in a group, and you benefit from frequent contacts
with people who share your ideals and aspirations.
 Mercury in the twelfth house: You’re mysterious, intuitive, contempla-
tive, and secretive. You can interpret dreams, break codes, and do all
kinds of other mental tasks that require creative thinking — and a little
privacy. Solitude refreshes your mind.
Venus in the Houses
The house occupied by Venus, the planet of love, indicates those areas in life
that bring you pleasure and stimulate your ability to connect with others.
 Venus in the first house: Whatever appears in the first house is obvious
to all. With Venus rising, you’re warm, sociable, and attractive, a quality
you also admire in others.
 Venus in the second house: You’ve heard that money can’t buy you
love. You just don’t believe it. Money and the things it can buy matter to
you, which is probably why astrologers associate this placement with
shopping. Fortunately, you’re adept at pulling in the green.
 Venus in the third house: You love to talk, travel, and gather informa-
tion. You express yourself eloquently, and your verbal abilities attract
admirers. You also interact well with your brothers and sisters. This is
an excellent position for a writer or public speaker.
 Venus in the fourth house: In the absence of other factors, this fortu-
nate placement bestows a happy childhood, a close tie to your mother, a
talent for decorating, and a beautiful home.
 Venus in the fifth house: You attract love and are great with children
(being somewhat of a child yourself). You respond to the arts and may be
naturally talented. A delight to be around, you get along with everyone
and enjoy life to the max. You’ll never lack for admirers or invitations.
 Venus in the sixth house: Work is as essential to your happiness as love.
When the one prospers, so does the other. You meet potential suitors
through your work, and you make friends and inspire affection on the
job. Fulfilling employment brings you happiness, improves your health,
and makes you more attractive.
 Venus in the seventh house: Affectionate and well-liked, you’re a conge-
nial person who’s happiest in a committed relationship. Thanks to your
innate charm, you attract a wide selection of potential mates and have
the ability to create a loving relationship, perhaps with someone in the
arts. Business partnerships are also beneficial.
157
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Venus in the eighth house: You’re seductive, manipulative, obsessive,
passionate, and often under the sway of a raging storm of feelings — and
that includes omnivorous sexual appetites. Your love life is probably a
maze of complications. You’re also shrewd with money, which often
comes your way through marriage, inheritance, or savvy investments.
 Venus in the ninth house: Love comes through anything that expands
your horizons, with emphasis on travel, education, law, and publishing,
all fields to which you’re well-suited. Philosophical and idealistic, you
respond to exciting ideas and large systems of thought. You could marry
a foreigner (or someone you meet while traveling), a professor, a writer,
a lawyer, a member of the clergy, and anyone involved with publishing.
 Venus in the tenth house: Your career, ideally in the arts, means a lot to
you. You’re likable and outgoing, and people want to help you. You
receive particular help from women, and your reputation is sterling —
unless you make it too obvious how socially ambitious you are. You
want a high-status spouse. Fortunately, people are naturally attracted to
you: You don’t have to push.
 Venus in the eleventh house: You’re open-minded, affectionate, and
cooperative, and people feel comfortable around you. You’re the hub of
your social circle, a natural leader within a group, and a devoted pal.
You easily attract both friends and lovers.
 Venus in the twelfth house: Highly attuned to the feelings of others,
you’re a sensitive person with a need for privacy and a tendency to be
secretive. Many people with this placement fall into clandestine love
affairs, while others, suffering from shyness and vulnerability, are so
easily hurt in social interactions that they pull back to lick their wounds.
Solitude calms you, and art can bring you peace.
Mars in the Houses
The position of Mars by house tells you where you’re most likely to act on
impulse, take risks, and pursue your personal desires.
 Mars in the first house: Vigorous and passionate, you initiate activities,
sometimes impulsively, and your passions (and anger) are obvious to
all. This position gives you great vitality along with an assertive person-
ality and can be a sign of the warrior.
 Mars in the second house: Competitive, acquisitive, and practical,
you feel happy when you can focus on a concrete goal. You want to
be rewarded for your efforts — and not only with praise. Money and
material objects do the trick more effectively than mere words.
158
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Mars in the third house: You have a vigorous, independent, and some-
times argumentative mind, and you call things as you see them —
even if that means jumping to conclusions. With your razor-sharp
wit, you’re impatient and easily distracted, and you can be aggressive
in conversation.
 Mars in the fourth house: You try to make up for a difficult childhood
by focusing on your domestic life. Highly protective of home and family,
you’re an independent person with a sturdy constitution and an inborn
vitality. Family matters consume you, but be careful not to create a
home environment filled with fighting and dissension.
 Mars in the fifth house: Impulsive, excitable, and highly sexed, you’re
active and fun-loving, and you take pleasure in initiating creative proj-
ects. You’re also very involved with your offspring, whether they’re lit-
eral flesh-and-blood babies or children of your imagination. Although
you can be impatient and competitive, you enjoy playing games, athletic
or otherwise, and are energized by risk-taking.
 Mars in the sixth house: Work excites you (even if it exhausts you).
You’re efficient, skilled, and precise, with great physical vitality, mechan-
ical skills, and a love for the tools of your trade. A dull job distresses
you, and constricting organizational rules make you angry and rebel-
lious. On the other hand, a challenge, even if it involves a gamble, stimu-
lates you. Guard against overwork and get plenty of exercise.
 Mars in the seventh house: Partnerships energize you, but that doesn’t
mean you have an easy time with them. When a relationship isn’t going
well, you bravely confront the issues, making Mars in the seventh house
the position of kiss-and-make-up. Alternatively, you may attract an
aggressive partner.
 Mars in the eighth house: You have powerful desires, with determina-
tion and sexual charisma to burn. A skilled researcher, you may be
attracted to healing arts and occult subjects. Financial wheeling and
dealing may also fascinate you, though money and inheritances can be a
source of conflict. Because this position stimulates a yearning for
intense experience, you fearlessly take steps that more sensible souls
avoid. This placement can bring a degree of wildness, making you irre-
sistible to others — and an occasional danger to yourself.
 Mars in the ninth house: You’re a passionate idealist and an indepen-
dent thinker with strong convictions, broad goals, and a desire to see
the world. Ideas motivate you, and you’re at home in the realms of law,
religion, and education. But you can slip into fanaticism and must guard
against becoming intolerant.
159
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Mars in the tenth house: A demanding, exciting career fills you with
energy. You’d like to be famous, but more than that, you’d like to be
involved in some grand effort, something that takes strategy and wits —
like a war, a social protest movement, or the making of an epic film.
Ambitious and aggressive, you want to make an impact on the world.
 Mars in the eleventh house: Your friends stimulate you and help you
achieve your aspirations. In a group, you rise to a leadership position.
But you can also be unreasonably demanding and may unconsciously
create conflicts or be drawn to quarrelsome individuals.
 Mars in the twelfth house: Other people may not understand who you
are because much of your energy, anger, and passion is hidden. You’re
hesitant to reveal these aspects of yourself, and as a result, you may feel
unrecognized. Nonetheless, spending time alone revitalizes you, and
you’re extremely effective when you’re working behind the scenes.

The Mars effect
It has long been an embarrassment to
astrologers that so little research has been
done in the discipline. One significant piece of
astrological research was conducted in the
1950s, by Michel Gauquelin, a French statisti-
cian who explored astrology in his youth, and
his wife, Françoise. They set out to prove that
astrology had no basis in scientific fact. They
examined the birth charts of over 20,000 people,
and what they found was astrology at its finest.
They didn’t announce that Sagittarians were
better horseback riders or that Capricorns were
better CEOs — nothing that obvious. Instead,
they unearthed a link between professional suc-
cess and planets located near the Ascendant,
Descendant, Midheaven, or I.C.
Specifically, they found that angular Jupiter
appeared more often than statistically probable
in the charts of successful actors; angular
Moon showed up in writers’ charts; angular
Venus turned up in the charts of painters and
musicians; angular Saturn appeared in the
charts of doctors and scientists; and angular
Mars showed up in the charts of champion ath-
letes. Two positions were the most powerful:
Those close to the Midheaven (in either the
ninth house or the first ten degrees of the tenth
house) and those close to the Ascendant (in
either the twelfth house or the first ten degrees
of the first house).
Many people tried to disprove this association,
and controversy raged over statistical methods.
Ultimately, the phenomenon held up and became
known as the Mars effect. Athletes who have an
angular Mars include Tiger Woods, Muhammad
Ali, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Neil Armstrong,
the first man to walk on the moon (and yes, in my
opinion, he counts as an athlete).
Not every successful professional has one of
these placements. The absence of an angular
planet doesn’t in any way doom you to failure.
But if, perchance, Mars (or any other planet)
happens to occupy the angular Gauquelin zones
in your chart, that planet should be considered
especially robust. In the case of Mars, it may not
bestow you with the ability to outdo Shaquille
O’Neal (whose Mars is in the first house). But it
should at least give you a certain swagger.

Jupiter in the Houses
Jupiter’s position by house determines the areas of life that are most bounti-
ful for you — the places where benefits come most effortlessly and also the
areas where you may become too complacent.
 Jupiter in the first house: You have an expansive, charismatic personal-
ity that naturally draws people to you. You may also have a tendency to
gain weight.
 Jupiter in the second house: Money and prosperity come your way,
often in the form of windfalls. The only downside is that your desire to
spend may outweigh your ability to earn, so be prudent — if you can.
 Jupiter in the third house: Talkative and hungry for information, you’re
intelligent and well-informed, though you run the risk of filling your mind
to the brim with tabloid gossip. You benefit from travel, reading, and the
company of your brothers and sisters.
 Jupiter in the fourth house: You’re a generous person who opens your
home to others. Comfortable, even luxurious, housing comes your way,
and you have a knack for making your home an agreeable, sustaining
place to be. Life improves as you grow older, and in old age, you’re sur-
rounded by comfort.
 Jupiter in the fifth house: Having fun yet? If you have this placement,
the answer is probably yes. This placement brings a profusion of roman-
tic affairs, a love of entertainment, the ability to have fun even in difficult
circumstances, and a joyous creativity. Although not everyone with this
placement becomes a parent, those who do derive great satisfaction
from it.
 Jupiter in the sixth house: Finding the right work is essential to your
happiness, and you like to be of service. In a satisfying job, you’re a
devoted employee (or a happy entrepreneur) who gets along famously
with colleagues. But you suffer from a tendency to overlook the details,
and you may become a workaholic. In work and in health, you need to
avoid excesses.
 Jupiter in the seventh house: You’re sociable and easy to be around.
Marriage and business partnerships are favored by this placement, and
you have multiple opportunities to form alliances. Even in an age of
divorce, people with this placement marry for life.
 Jupiter in the eighth house: Financially, you stand to gain from invest-
ments, insurance, inheritances, and businesses that you enter into with
other people. You have a strong sex drive, a deep interest in the process
of personal change, and excellent powers of recuperation.
161
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Jupiter in the ninth house: You have an expansive, optimistic attitude
toward life. A natural teacher with a philosophical bent, you want to see
it all and understand it all. You benefit from anything that expands your
horizons, such as travel, education, religion, and publishing.
 Jupiter in the tenth house: With a little effort, you can fulfill your desire
for recognition. You have natural leadership ability; people want to
assist you, and you thrive in the public eye. This position brings suc-
cess, prominence, and even fame.
 Jupiter in the eleventh house: You’re open-minded, congenial, helpful,
and fair. You work effectively with others, you know a zillion people, and
your friends adore you. Large ambitions bring out the best in you.
Success comes through group enterprises.
 Jupiter in the twelfth house: You’re sympathetic, introspective, and
generous. You may have psychic abilities but may suffer from a ten-
dency to overextend yourself. Solitude and spiritual pursuits calm you
down and prepare you for your forays into the world.
Saturn in the Houses
Saturn’s position by house determines those areas of life in which you feel
the pinch of limitation and will benefit from establishing boundaries, creating
structures, and practicing self-discipline.
 Saturn in the first house: You’re self-conscious and afraid of being hurt.
You worry what people think of you, and as a result you may cloak your
personality in defensive armor. Beneath your cautious exterior, you’re a
complicated, serious person, well worth the effort of getting to know.
But you don’t make it easy.
 Saturn in the second house: You worry about the practical side of life,
and money is an issue, whether you’re frugal or a spendthrift. Even
when dealing with emotional concerns, you’re aware of the practical
implications. You’d like to win the lottery, but it’s unlikely to happen
(and if it did, it could bring you more trouble than it’s worth). Instead,
you can gain the security you seek through your own hard work.
 Saturn in the third house: You have a conscientious, contemplative
mind and the ability to explore a subject in depth. Communication
issues, whether in speech or in writing, are paramount. You have compli-
cated relationships with your brothers and sisters, and sibling rivalry
may be an issue for you.
 Saturn in the fourth house: Although your family is extremely impor-
tant to you, you feel alienated from them (and perhaps from one parent
in particular). Finding ways to interact successfully with family members
(or simply to understand them) requires effort. Owning your own home
is a gratifying source of identity and security.
162
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Saturn in the fifth house: You take a serious approach to playful things,
and it’s difficult for you to lighten up. You don’t flirt easily and are more
comfortable dating people who are older and more serious. Creativity is
important to you, but because you may fear that you aren’t talented, you
may suppress your artistic urges. Or, you may rise to the challenge of
Saturn and bring structure to your creative life. (Some people with this
placement become professional artists.) As a parent, you’re responsible
and committed.
 Saturn in the sixth house: In your work, you’re reliable, exacting, and
efficient. If you have the courage to insist on doing something you love,
you find fulfillment through your work. In your daily life, you pay equally
close attention to your chores and responsibilities, but you’re a big-time
worrier, especially about your health. Reassure yourself by getting regu-
lar checkups.
 Saturn in the seventh house: You take a serious approach to marriage,
but you may also shy away from it. If you overcome your fears of inti-
macy, you can create a long-lived, solid relationship. You’ll be most com-
fortable with an older partner who’s responsible and sober-minded.
 Saturn in the eighth house: You have great psychological insight. Your
challenge is to overcome your fear of death and to face your sexual
issues, which can range anywhere from total inhibition to emotionless
promiscuity. Also, you’re both cautious and skilled in making money —
which is fortunate, because the chances are high that you’ll marry some-
one who has financial problems.
 Saturn in the ninth house: You’re a thoughtful person with wide-ranging
intelligence. You’re attracted to large ideas — philosophy or religion, for
example — and your thorough exploration of them makes you a natural
educator, writer, publisher, or lawyer.
 Saturn in the tenth house: You’re responsible, ambitious, and persever-
ing. This placement generally indicates great success, but you can also
be arrogant, and you have to pay your dues before you achieve the
recognition that’s ultimately yours. One of your parents (most likely
your father) may have been especially difficult.
 Saturn in the eleventh house: You expect great things of yourself, and
you set ambitious goals, even if you fear that you aren’t up to them.
Fortunately, you have excellent organizational abilities and great determi-
nation, and you can mobilize the help you need. You don’t make friends
lightly, but the friendships you do form are long-lasting and consequential.
 Saturn in the twelfth house: Many people would be astonished to know
that beneath your helpful surface, you wrestle with fear, pessimism, inse-
curity, loneliness, and guilt. Although you’re used to working by yourself
or behind the scenes, your fears become most terrifying when you’re
alone. You avoid solitude — and yet it’s essential to your welfare. Your
task is to find ways to be comfortable with it.
163
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

Uranus in the Houses
The position that Uranus occupies by house determines the area in life in
which you can expect the unexpected.
 Uranus in the first house: You have an unusual demeanor, and you
strike people as a true original. No matter how hard you try to look con-
ventional, your attempts to pass for ordinary are doomed. From time to
time, out-of-left-field events turn your world upside down.
 Uranus in the second house: Money and possessions come and go,
arriving and departing with equal speed. You may strike oil, or you may
go bankrupt. Your values can undergo a sudden turnaround.
 Uranus in the third house: You have an innovative mind and a clever
way of expressing yourself. You could be a brilliant thinker or writer —
or you could be a nut. You have unusual siblings, but your relationships
with them have their ups and downs. Upsets can occur while traveling.
 Uranus in the fourth house: You come from or create an unconventional
family. An erratic relationship with one of your parents (your mother,
most likely) has a strong impact on you. You find it hard to settle down,
and when you do, you set up housekeeping in a thoroughly individual
way. Professional changes affect your domestic life.
 Uranus in the fifth house: You have a wild creative streak and an unpre-
dictable love life. You’re prone to love at first sight, preferably with
rebellious types. But sudden breakups are also part of the picture. Your
children may be remarkable people, though you may feel that they
hamper your freedom.
 Uranus in the sixth house: You don’t mind working, but you oppose the
concept of nine-to-five. You manage to find unusual, even peculiar jobs.
And even in your daily life, you do things in a unique way. Your nerves
affect your health, and you benefit from unorthodox healing techniques.
 Uranus in the seventh house: You may marry an unconventional person,
or you may create a free-wheeling relationship that acknowledges, in its
radical format, your need for independence. You’re liable to marry with
lightning speed, but be careful — you could divorce the same way.
 Uranus in the eighth house: Your sex life has a remarkable, even outra-
geous, aspect to it, and the same is true for your finances (and those of
your spouse). You benefit from unusual investment. You’re also drawn to
metaphysical subjects, including the idea of reincarnation. And though I
hesitate to mention this, you may as well know: When it coexists with a
rare pileup of especially tough aspects, this placement can indicate the
possibility of sudden, accidental death — not necessarily your own.
Should you worry? No. Keep in mind that literally one out of every
twelve people has this placement. For further information, see the
nearby “Violent death and Princess Diana” sidebar.
164
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Uranus in the ninth house: Unusual experiences come to you through
travel, education, and the law. You’re interested in religion but not in a
conventional way, and your philosophy of life is your own invention.
 Uranus in the tenth house: You insist on maintaining your indepen-
dence, especially regarding your career. (Fulfilling areas include — but
are not limited to — social activism, computer technology, astrology,
and science.) You have an original viewpoint, and professional opportu-
nities arrive out of nowhere. Too rebellious to work in a strongly hierar-
chical organization, you’re a natural entrepreneur or freelancer.
 Uranus in the eleventh house: You’re a tolerant person with unusual
aspirations and many highly intelligent, erratic friends who motivate you
to achieve. People enter your life on a moment’s notice, especially when
you’re involved with a cause, but you can lose contact with them just as
quickly. Your many diverse friends reflect your widely scattered interests.
 Uranus in the twelfth house: You’re a freedom-lover who requires inde-
pendence and rebels against constraints. Unusual forms of spirituality
attract you. You express your deepest individuality in solitude. Flashes of
intuition and insight come from your core. Learn to pay attention to them.
165
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses
Violent death and Princess Diana
Reading old-fashioned astrology books can be
terrifying. They’re filled with scary-sounding
predictions of poverty, illness, and even death.
These old books can be particularly nerve-
wracking if you have a placement such as
Uranus, the planet of the unexpected, or Mars,
the planet of violence, in the eighth house of
death and regeneration. It sounds bad. The truth
is that many indicators are required for some-
thing as serious as violent death. Not even the
presence of both Uranus and Mars in the eighth
house promises such a tragedy. For that, you’d
need truly horrific aspects — like those of
Princess Diana, a sensitive Cancerian with the
Moon in Aquarius.
Not only was Diana’s eighth house home to both
Uranus and Mars, it also held Pluto, the planet
of transformation. In addition, Uranus formed a
high-stress T-square pattern with the Moon and
Venus, the planets that ruled her love life. (For 
a discussion of the T-square, see Chapter 14.)
This is an unusually bad combination of
aspects. Her chart clearly held the potential of
a life-threatening accident involving a lover. In
addition, at the time of her death, the position of
the outer planets in the sky heightened the
perils that were lying in wait in her birth chart.
But did she have to die that day, right before an
eclipse? Some astrologers contend that you
can’t escape your fate. Others, myself among
them, believe that every influence has many
possible expressions. Certainly Diana’s chart
was under enormous stress at the time of her
fatal car crash. Even in retrospect, we can’t
know whether Diana could have avoided this
terrible accident. This much is certain, though:
Taking precautions — and fastening her safety
belt — couldn’t have hurt.

Neptune in the Houses
The house that Neptune inhabits in your horoscope tells you where you can
access the most profound level of intuition — and where you’re prone to
deception.
 Neptune in the first house: You’re impressionable, dreamy, and fluid.
Your intuition is acute, but you can easily become dependent. You con-
fuse and fascinate people; they aren’t sure who you are or what you’re
up to because your identity seems to shift. There’s a good chance that
you have musical or artistic ability.
 Neptune in the second house: You have an intuitive sense of how to
make money. You can even earn money through spiritual pursuits. But
you also have the ability to be defrauded because you haven’t a clue
about the mechanics of saving money, and as a result, your financial
affairs are likely to be chaotic. Hire a responsible earth sign to help.
 Neptune in the third house: You’re impressionable, imaginative, and
highly sensitive to language. Persuasive but easily distracted, you soak
up knowledge and have poetic ability. You’re also gullible — and no one
knows how to fool you better than your brothers and sisters.
 Neptune in the fourth house: The members of your family are an
unusual lot. Their influence is powerful and subtle, and you find it diffi-
cult to separate from them. You may have inherited psychic ability.
 Neptune in the fifth house: You’re artistic and sensitive, but you find it
difficult to focus your creativity. Platonic relationships and secret affairs
may characterize your romantic life, and you’re drawn to people who
mystify you. Your children (should you conquer your ambivalence about
that subject and decide to become a parent) are likely to be impression-
able and gentle, and you have a strong psychic tie with them.
 Neptune in the sixth house: You tend to get caught in the web of office
politics, and the physical aspects of regular jobs — the fluorescent
lights, the hideous decor — make you long for escape. Job possibilities
exist in film, pharmacology, music, fashion, and anything connected to
the sea. Keep in mind that your health complaints are seldom solved
through Western-style medicine. Doctors have difficulty diagnosing you,
and you do better with more intuitive healing styles.
 Neptune in the seventh house: Moody people and artistic souls attract
you. You seek your spiritual soul mate, but in your confusion about rela-
tionships, you may sacrifice yourself to an image or ideal that has noth-
ing to do with your actual partner. Idealism about relationships is
wonderful, but only when it’s tempered with realism.
166
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Neptune in the eighth house: Séances, Ouija boards, extrasensory per-
ception, and all forms of communication with the great beyond attract
you. You consider sex a spiritual exercise. But you may trust your
instincts too much, especially when it comes to your money and your
partner. Be careful in business partnerships.
 Neptune in the ninth house: Mystical religions and spiritual journeys
are your cup of chai. You want desperately to identify a specific spiritual
path, but it won’t happen that way, for visionary Neptune will take you
in many directions. You’re also a sensitive teacher.
 Neptune in the tenth house: By choosing a profession that requires you
to tap into your intuition, you find the success you covet. Following a
profession just because you think it’s practical (as if you would know) is
a waste of time. Here are two career problems you may face: You tend to
drift, and you seldom assert yourself.
 Neptune in the eleventh house: You have shifting ideals and vague aspi-
rations, along with a large collection of inspiring, talented friends who
may have drug and alcohol problems. Unfortunately, you tend to see
what you want to see in your friends. Joining a spiritual organization
could help you to see straight.
 Neptune in the twelfth house: You’re empathetic, contemplative, reclu-
sive, and probably psychic. You receive a continual flow of messages from
your unconscious. Metaphysics, dreams, and secrets fascinate you, and
you’re highly responsive to those in need. Your creative efforts are best
accomplished in private, and solitude is necessary for your peace of mind.
Pluto in the Houses
The house that tiny Pluto occupies in your natal chart determines the area in
life where you’re most likely to experience obsession and transformation.
 Pluto in the first house: You have a compulsive, controlling, and mag-
netic personality, along with a tendency to dominate. You make a power-
ful impact on people — but you may also alienate them.
 Pluto in the second house: You find concrete outlets for your abilities,
but you can also become obsessed with your possessions. More impor-
tantly, money can become a battlefield, and you may struggle to control
other people with it.
 Pluto in the third house: You have a profound mind, accurate percep-
tions, a longing to solve the mysteries of life, and an obsessive need to
communicate combined with a strong sense of privacy. (Surely the
inventor of the locked diary had Pluto in the third house.)
167
Chapter 12: The Sun, the Moon, and the Planets in the Houses

 Pluto in the fourth house: One of your parents was a force to be reck-
oned with; dealing with the psychological fallout is your Plutonian task.
Your greatest transformations come through your family and home.
 Pluto in the fifth house: You become obsessed with romance. Yet no
matter how hard you try to manipulate your lover, the person most
altered by the liaison is you. Power struggles spring up around children.
Creative endeavors are transformative for you. Gambling is addictive.
 Pluto in the sixth house: You have great focus and drive, and you may
have healing abilities. Because your desire for power is focused on work,
you may overdo it and work to the point of obsession. Your job must
have meaning or your health may suffer. You need purpose.
 Pluto in the seventh house: Relationship and obsession go hand in hand
with you, and marriage is a testing ground. You attract a commanding
partner whose influence causes you to change in profound ways.
Maintaining your sense of self in the presence of this powerful being
isn’t easy. Business partnerships offer similar challenges.
 Pluto in the eighth house: Life after death, extrasensory perception, and
all occult subjects fascinate you, and you gain wisdom through those
channels. You’re intuitive, perceptive, and deeply serious. You must
grapple with the truly big issues in life, including the troublesome feel-
ings that surround sex, money, and death.
 Pluto in the ninth house: Philosophy, religion, and the law attract and
strengthen you. By immersing yourself in study or becoming passion-
ately involved with people from a culture other than your own, you
deepen your understanding. Education and travel are your tickets to
transformation, but you must approach them on your own terms.
 Pluto in the tenth house: You’re an irresistible force in the political
arena. You resent authority figures (starting with one of your parents),
and yet you wish to wield authority. When you decide to seek power,
you can be a real player. This position favors success.
 Pluto in the eleventh house: Friendship is a charged area for you, espe-
cially when young. But ultimately, your friends help shape your dreams
and aspirations, and deeply transformative experiences come to you
through those relationships.
 Pluto in the twelfth house: You’re a private person with a secret life.
You shy away from expressing your power, and yet you’re fascinated by
whatever is going on beneath the surface, especially in your own
psyche. Delving into your unconscious brings transformation.
168

Interpreting Empty Houses
Do the math: Your chart has twelve houses, but only ten planets. This means
that you’re bound to have empty houses somewhere in your chart. They’re
unavoidable. They’re also nothing to worry about.
Having an empty house of marriage, for example, doesn’t mean that you’ll
always be single. Just ask Elizabeth Taylor, who has had eight husbands (so
far), despite the fact that her seventh house is totally vacant. Similarly, an
unoccupied second house of money doesn’t mean you’re destined for poverty.
Look at Bill Gates, the youngest self-made billionaire in history. His second
house is empty (as is his eighth house, which is also associated with money).
Often, an unoccupied house signifies that the usual concerns of that house
are simply not a major concern. But you can’t make that determination with a
casual glance. Just because a house is empty doesn’t mean it’s unimportant.
The truth is that there’s so much to think about in a natal chart that even an
empty house can keep you busy. To investigate an empty house, I suggest the
following three-step method:
1. Look at the sign on the cusp of the house.
The sign at the beginning of each house determines your approach to
the concerns of that house. For example, turn to Andy Warhol’s chart in
Chapter 19. Notice that his second house of money is empty, with Virgo
on the cusp. (The cusp of the second house is at eight o’clock, the cusp of
the third house is at seven o’clock, and so on.) Thus his approach to finan-
cial matters was Virgoan: discriminating and detail-oriented. And, indeed,
he made a habit of recording his daily expenses — just like a Virgo.
Table 12-1 at the beginning of this chapter summarizes the concerns of
each house. Table 12-2 suggests ways to interpret the sign on the cusp.
2. Check out the planet that rules the sign on the cusp.
The position of that planet tells you a great deal. In Andy Warhol’s case,
Virgo, the sign on the cusp of his second house, is ruled by Mercury. It
can be found in flamboyant Leo — a perfect placement for an artist who
literally painted money.
3. Look at the aspects made by the ruling planet.
If the ruling planet of the empty house is close to the Sun or the Moon,
its importance increases. If it is conjunct Jupiter, the concerns of that
house are blessed with good fortune. If it opposes Saturn, difficulties
arise. And so on. For more about aspects, turn to Chapter 13.

Finally, keep in mind that every year, as the Sun makes its annual pilgrimage
through the zodiac, it travels through each part of your chart — every sign and
every house. The Moon and the other planets visit as well, each according to
its own schedule. Over time, those transiting planets activate each and every
house — even if it’s empty. Sooner or later, every house will have its day.

nowing the position of the planets by sign and by house isn’t enough.
To comprehend the true complexity of an astrological chart, you need
to know how the planets interact with each other. That information is
revealed by the mathematical angles, or aspects, between the planets.
Consider the case of a woman whose Venus, the planet of love, is located
within a few short degrees of Jupiter, the planet of good fortune. That combi-
nation makes expressing affection and finding love easy for her. But what if
both planets are 90° from Saturn? With that harsh right angle, pessimism and
disappointment enter the picture. Now you have a charming individual who
easily attracts others yet is never content with them — a person who, like
Groucho Marx, doesn’t want to be in a club that would have her as a member.
To detect that kind of internal process in your own chart, you need to know
the degree of the zodiac that each planet occupies. That information, which
is beyond the scope of this book, is easy to get via the Internet. (See Chapter
2 for tips on how to do that.) Once you have a copy of your chart, you’re
ready to pick out the major aspects in it. Take my word for it: It’s a snap.
Identifying the Major Aspects
An astrological chart, like any circle, has 360°, with each sign of the zodiac
covering exactly 30°, or one-twelfth of the whole. Within that circle, each pair

of planets is separated by a specific number of degrees. Planets at certain sig-
nificant distances from each other form an aspect. Table 13-1 lists the major
aspects, along with their symbols.
Table 13-1
Major Aspects

Conjunction

60°
Sextile
Supports
90°
Square
Creates friction
120°
Trine
Assists and brings 
opportunities
180°
Opposition
Opposes
Roughly speaking, there are three types of aspects. If two planets are within a
few degrees of each other, they’re conjunct, which means that they operate in
unison. If two planets are 60° or 120° apart, they support and assist each other.
These aspects — sextiles and trines — are considered harmonious. And if two
planets are at right angles (90°) or opposite each other (180°), they’re basically
at war. These aspects — squares and oppositions — are considered hard.
Look at Oprah Winfrey’s chart (Figure 13-1). She’s a forward-thinking
Aquarian with the Moon in optimistic, freedom-loving Sagittarius. She also
has a series of aspects, both easy and challenging. They include:
 An exact conjunction between the Sun and Venus at 9° Aquarius
 A harmonious trine between Mercury, the planet of communication,
at 19° Aquarius and expansive Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, 
at 16° Gemini
 A stressful square between aggressive Mars at 23° Scorpio and Pluto
at 24° Leo
Like most people, Oprah has a mix of conjunctions, harmonious aspects, and
hard aspects in her chart.
Surprisingly, an “easy” chart festooned with sextiles and trines isn’t necessar-
ily better than a “hard” chart crisscrossed with squares and opposition.
Astrologers have long noted that people with harmonious charts run the risk
of becoming lazy and self-satisfied, while highly accomplished achievers
often have high-stress charts.
172
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

The most powerful aspects occur when the distances between the planets
are close to those listed in Table 13-1. A 90° square, for example, is stronger
than an 82° square, regardless of the planets involved. But observation indi-
cates that an aspect doesn’t have to be precise to have an influence. So
astrologers allow a little leeway on either side. This leeway is called the orb of
influence. Astrologers differ, however, about how large that orb should be. A
few generous practitioners use an orb as wide as 14°. Stricter seers permit no
more than a 5° orb. Most astrologers, myself included, fall somewhere in the
middle.
In general, I recommend using an 8° orb for the conjunction, square, trine, or
opposition and a 6° orb for the sextile, which is a slightly weaker aspect.
(Minor aspects, which I discuss later in this chapter, can handle only a 2°
orb.) In each case, you can tack on an additional 2° if the Sun or Moon is
involved. This means that if your Sun is at 14°, any planet between 4° and 24°
of your Sun sign is considered conjunct, a planet 52° to 68° away is sextile,
and so on. Remember: The tighter the orb, the more powerful the aspect.

Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Figuring Out Your Aspects
Here’s how to locate the five major aspects in your chart:
 Conjunctions: You can readily detect conjunctions. If two planets are
within 8° of each other (10° if the Sun or the Moon is involved), they’re
conjunct. For example, if you have Mars at 5° Sagittarius and Jupiter at 7°
Sagittarius, they’re conjunct. The same rule applies even if the two plan-
ets are in different signs. For instance, if you have Venus at 28° Capricorn
and the Moon at 1° Aquarius, Venus and the Moon are conjunct.
 Oppositions: To pick out oppositions, look for planets on opposite sides
of the chart. Planets in opposing signs often (though not always) form
an opposition. To be sure, check whether they’re within orb. If your
Mars is at 18° Sagittarius, any planet between 10° and 26° Gemini is in
opposition. A planet at 6° Gemini isn’t in opposition.
 Squares: Squares are more difficult to spot. Look for planets in signs of
the same quality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). Then check that they’re
about 90° apart, plus or minus 8°. If they are, you’ve found the source of
your deepest frustrations. In Oprah’s chart, for example, Saturn, at 9°
Scorpio, forms a square to Venus — which definitely puts a damper on
her love life.
 Trines: You find trines between planets in signs of the same element —
that is, both planets are in fire, earth, air, or water signs. Maybe you
have Mercury in Gemini and Uranus in Libra? If they’re within 8° of each
other, they’re trine — in which case, congratulations: You have a quick,
original mind.
 Sextiles: The weakest of the major aspects, sextiles happen between
planets that are two signs apart. In Oprah’s chart, for example, Pluto at
24° Leo is sextile Neptune at 26° Libra.
Table 13-2 gives you squares and oppositions at a glance, and Table 13-3
does the same for the harmonious aspects.

When planets are in the first few degrees or the last few degrees of a sign, be
sure to check for out-of-sign aspects, which are notoriously difficult to detect.
If you’re looking at a chart with, say, the Sun at 28° Gemini and Saturn at 1°
Libra, it’s easy to assume that because both planets are in air signs, they
must be trine. In fact, they’re separated by 93° and are therefore square. This
is why you should get a computer-generated chart. Even an experienced
astrologer can miss an out-of-sign aspect, but you can’t trick a computer.

Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

A Note about Minor Aspects
The major aspects discussed in this chapter aren’t the only geometrical
relationship that astrologers consider significant. Other aspects, typically
described as minor aspects, also connect two planets. Because minor aspects
are weak, the orb allotted to them is small — only 2°.
Two minor aspects I refer to in this chapter are the semi-sextile, a 30° aspect
that’s considered mildly positive, and the semi-square, a 45° aspect whose
influence is somewhat stressful. These minor aspects rise in importance if
the chart has a scarcity of major aspects, as occasionally happens. But
remember, they call them minor for a reason.
Table 13-4 lists the most important of the minor aspects.

Are there other minor aspects? You bet. There’s the septile, the novile, and
more. I’ve seen symbols for aspects I’ve never even heard of. You can reach a
point when adding more aspects to a chart only obliterates the big picture.
That’s why I recommend sticking with the majors.
Interpreting the Aspects
In this section, I interpret the main aspects for each of the planets. I bundle
sextiles and trines together as harmonious aspects. Their actions are similar,
though trines are more powerful. Similarly, I tie squares and oppositions
together as hard aspects, though they aren’t identical either. In general, a
square brings internal conflicts, while oppositions are more likely to create
external obstructions.
176
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

I consider the planets in this order: first the Sun and Moon, then the planets
in order of their distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. When looking up an aspect, be sure to look for it
under the planet that comes first in the list. An aspect between Mercury and
Uranus, for example, appears under Mercury; an opposition between Venus
and Pluto is discussed under Venus, and so on.
Aspects to the Sun
Your Sun sign represents the deepest, most essential part of your nature. The
aspects it makes with other planets can help you express your potential or
make it more difficult.
Sun/Moon
The Sun represents your conscious identity, while the Moon governs your
innermost feelings and subconscious self. The Sun/Moon aspect shows how
comfortably these two cooperate.
 Conjunction: If your Sun and Moon are conjunct, you were born around
the time of a new moon, with all the vitality that implies. Your will and
your subconscious work together, so you have strong intentions, enthu-
siasm, and the ability to concentrate. You may also be stubborn and
closed-minded.
 Harmonious aspects: With your Sun sextile or trine the Moon, you’re
genial and energetic. Opportunities come your way. All things being
equal, you’re basically at peace with yourself. Consider yourself blessed.
 Hard aspects: If your Sun and Moon are square, your conscious self
desires one thing, and your subconscious yearns for something else. So
you’re never truly satisfied, and you may struggle with a tendency to
sabotage yourself. Interestingly, this discomfort turns out to be highly
motivating. Legions of accomplished people in every field have this
aspect — so many that I’m not even sure it’s a disadvantage.
If your Sun and Moon are in opposition, you were born under a full
moon, a time when emotions run high. Restless and conflicted, you find
it difficult to match your desires to your abilities. You attract stressful
relationships and may overreact to obstacles. Although a few people
with Sun/Moon oppositions screw up in astonishing ways (extreme
example: Michael Jackson), the opposition also motivates them to
conquer the internal divide and become hugely successful.
177
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Sun/Mercury
The fiery Sun governs your ego while Mercury rules communication. This
aspect reveals the ease with which you express your thoughts.
 Conjunction: These two bodies can never be more than 28° apart, so
plenty of people have this aspect. It indicates a nervous, quick disposi-
tion. When the conjunction is exceptionally close, within a degree or
less, it may indicate an over-the-top level of self-involvement.
 Harmonious aspects: Mercury and the Sun are never far enough apart to
form a sextile (60°) or trine (120°). But they can occasionally be sepa-
rated by 28°, making them semi-sextile, a mildly helpful aspect that
strengthens your ability to communicate.
 Hard aspects: Mercury and the Sun are always so close together that
they never form a hard aspect.
Sun/Venus
How these two planets interact influences your artistic talents, your sociabil-
ity, and your ability to attract what you love — particularly with regard to
relationships, money, and possessions.
 Conjunction: You’re appealing, affectionate, and creative. You have a
deep need to be in relationships, an innate capacity for intimacy, and a
love of pleasure. This aspect also brings artistic talent. Because Venus
can never be farther than 48° from the Sun, this is the only major aspect
that these two bodies can form.
 Harmonious aspects: Venus and the Sun are never far enough apart to
form a sextile or a trine. But if they’re 30° apart, they’re semi-sextile, a
friendly minor aspect that supports artistic talents and the ability to
express affection.
 Hard aspects: The Sun and Venus are never in opposition and are never
square. When they’re close to their maximum distance, they’re semi-
square, a 45° minor aspect that can stir up sexual issues and can cause
you to act out. Want examples? Think of Hugh Hefner, Bill Clinton,
Woody Allen, and the Marquis de Sade.
Sun/Mars
This aspect describes your ability to focus your energy and to put your inten-
tions into action.
 Conjunction: You’re an adventurer with energy, courage, and strong
passions — sexual and otherwise. You’re enterprising, competitive, and
willing to take the initiative — a contender in every way.
178
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Harmonious aspects: Energy is there when you want it. You’re assertive
without being combative and energetic without being manic.
 Hard aspects: Controlling the vitality that flows through you isn’t easy.
You tend to overdo it, often by being a workaholic. Your temper can get
out of control. You can be contentious and accident-prone, and you have
a tendency to act rashly. Extreme example: Lizzie Borden.
Sun/Jupiter
Combine the Sun, which represents your potential, with Jupiter, the bringer
of opportunities, and you have an enviable aspect. The challenge is to make
use of the connection between the two planets — not to waste it.
 Conjunction: You’re blessed with good fortune, a sense of humor, high
intelligence, a strong spirit, and an optimistic attitude. You can also be
careless and overconfident, relying on the indisputable fact that luck is
with you.
 Harmonious aspects: This aspect brings health, success, a pleasing and
positive approach to life, and a generous nature. Possible downside: You
may have a tendency to kick back and be lazy.
 Hard aspects: You’re inclined to exaggerate, to become self-important,
to misjudge, and to lack a sense of moderation. Extravagance may
plague you. Even so, this aspect, because it features Jupiter, can bring
opportunities and is often beneficial.
Sun/Saturn
The Sun wants to dazzle. Somber Saturn advocates caution. When these two
planets form a major aspect, it indicates that you feel tested in various ways.
This aspect shows the way you deal with those challenges.
 Conjunction: Restrained but persistent, you’re responsible, realistic, and
introspective. You take yourself seriously. This is a taxing aspect but one
that brings direction, determination, and the capacity to overcome your
early sense of inadequacy through solid accomplishments.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re industrious, goal-oriented, and willing to
accept responsibility for your own situation. Purposeful and practical,
you look before you leap, and your caution pays off.
 Hard aspects: In childhood, disappointments and frustrations may have
battered your sense of self-worth. If your Sun and Saturn are square,
your issues are primarily internal. If your Sun and Saturn are opposed,
external obstacles or enemies may block your path. Ultimately, you have
the ability to overcome everything through self-discipline, persistence,
and the thing Saturn loves above all else: hard work.
179
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Sun/Uranus
The Sun represents your core identity. Uranus represents your most eccen-
tric side. If they form a major aspect, you can be sure of this: You aren’t like
anybody else.
 Conjunction: Independent, unpredictable, and thoroughly unique, you
take an individualistic, original approach to life. You’re impulsive and
eccentric, a genius or a rebel, and magnetic either way. Examples: Meryl
Streep and Sean Penn.
 Harmonious aspects: A free-spirited adventurer, you possess originality,
independence, a flexible attitude, and a tendency to stumble into unex-
pected patches of good luck.
 Hard aspects: You’re an unusual, dramatic person with an unfortunate
tendency to act in eccentric and impractical ways and to make rash
decisions. Rebellious and easily bored, you’re likely to head off in un-
predictable directions, especially when events take you by surprise, as
they occasionally do.
Sun/Neptune
The Sun bestows vitality, while dreamy Neptune brings inspiration . . . or
indolence. This combination can encourage creative potential or unrealistic
schemes.
 Conjunction: You’re a dreamer, a poet, and an inspired idealist. Intuitive,
sensitive, and sometimes even psychic, you have a finely developed imagi-
nation and great creative talent for both mystical and artistic endeavors,
which leaves little room for practical matters. You also have a tendency to
lie to yourself (or to others) and to live in a world of fantasy, seeing only
what you want to see. Drug and alcohol abuse may be a problem.
 Harmonious aspects: You have a strongly developed sense of intuition
and the ability to use your imagination in constructive ways.
 Hard aspects: You have an active imagination combined with a discour-
aging tendency to daydream and to delude yourself. As with all Neptune
aspects, deception can be a problem, either because you choose to
deceive others or because you’re so gullible that anyone can pull the
wool over your eyes.
Sun/Pluto
If these two planets form a major aspect, control is an issue for you. This aspect
reveals the way you balance your core identity with your need for power.
 Conjunction: A vigorous, charismatic person, you’re an extremist, with
strong reactions, great willpower, and the ability to transform yourself.
You may struggle with a tendency to dominate or to become obsessed.
180
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Harmonious aspects: Strong-willed, persevering, and at ease with power
and its uses, you have personal insight combined with the ability to
adapt to circumstances and to create positive change.
 Hard aspects: Competition eggs you on. Acutely aware of the uses of
personal power, you’re manipulative, resourceful, and sometimes intimi-
dating. The challenge, whether you’re competing with others or simply
trying to fulfill your own considerable ambition, is to avoid becoming
overly aggressive or power-mad.
Aspects to the Moon
The Moon represents your emotions, instincts, habits, and subconscious.
Moon/Mercury
Do you have a strong need to communicate your emotions? If Mercury and
the Moon form a major aspect, the answer is yes.
 Conjunction: You’re intelligent, responsive, and in touch with your emo-
tions. You know how to communicate confidently and with grace.
 Harmonious aspects: You think clearly, communicate effectively, make
good use of humor, and have an excellent memory.
 Hard aspects: You respond quickly but often become anxious. Gifted
with an unconventional mind, you often feel that people don’t under-
stand you, and you’re highly sensitive to criticism.
Moon/Venus
If the Moon and Venus form a major aspect, your emotional needs and your
need for love and beauty are intertwined.
 Conjunction: A great lover of comfort, you’re responsive, appealing,
kind, creative, and pleasant to be around. Your mood depends on your
relationships, and you can get all wrapped up in the game of love.
 Harmonious aspects: You express your affections easily. You’re a
likable person with good taste and finely developed romantic sensibili-
ties, even if you do occasionally stumble into the pit of self-indulgence.
 Hard aspects: Your love affairs travel a bumpy road of conflict and
emotional frustration. Some people react by withdrawing, others
by becoming demanding and possessive. Either way, you can’t help feel-
ing that you have to work harder than other people to get what
you want.
181
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Moon/Mars
If you have a major aspect between the Moon and Mars, you’re assertive
about the way you express your emotions.
 Conjunction: You’re emotionally intense, impatient, and quick to anger.
You let people know how you feel, and you aren’t always diplomatic
about it.
 Harmonious aspects: Courageous, energetic, helpful, and direct, you’re
a risk-taker who’s always ready to jump into new situations.
 Hard aspects: Rash, defensive, and sometimes volatile, you’re impulsive,
competitive, and bossy. You don’t hold back from expressing your emo-
tions, and your fluctuating moods can stir up conflict. No matter what
face you show the world, anger is an issue you must address.
Moon/Jupiter
The Moon wants to pour out her feelings, while extravagant Jupiter says
“More is more” — which makes for a potent emotional cocktail.
 Conjunction: You’re warm, optimistic, considerate, and empathetic, a
person of huge feeling even if you do occasionally promise more than
you can deliver. You have faith in your own abilities. You feel best when
possibilities are multiplying and your universe is expanding.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re highly responsive, gentle, and supportive: a
genuine human being.
 Hard aspects: It’s all or nothing with you. You’re ecstatic or grief-stricken,
blissed out or on the verge of collapse. In short, you have trouble control-
ling your feelings and you tend to go overboard.
Moon/Saturn
Saturn is the planet of restraint, and the Moon is all about unbridled emo-
tions. This pair could be called “Sense and Sensibility.”
 Conjunction: The past has a strong hold on you. You may suffer from
self-doubt as a result of a less-than-warm relationship with your mother.
Fortunately, you wield the weapon of self-control. Common sense helps
you focus your feelings in a positive way.
 Harmonious aspects: Disciplined and sensible, you make a mighty effort
to control your emotions, and you generally succeed. This explains
how daredevil Evel Knievel and horror writer Stephen King can do what
they do.
 Hard aspects: A history of emotional deprivation makes you hesitant
and self-conscious. Though pessimism, repressed emotions, and difficul-
ties with women may distress you, your understanding grows with matu-
rity, as does your ability to find happiness and contentment.
182
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Moon/Uranus
There’s never a dull moment when the emotional Moon pairs up with the
planet of unpredictability.
 Conjunction: Impulsive and excitable, you react in unconventional ways,
attract unusual experiences, and may suffer from unpredictable mood
swings. This is a volatile combination.
 Harmonious aspects: You rebel against restriction and convention,
pride yourself on your independence, and value your autonomy, even
within relationships. You’re attracted to stimulating, exciting people and
unusual situations.
 Hard aspects: Talented and easily distracted, you can’t stand feeling
constrained. You get worked up easily and from time to time you stir 
up (or attract) a crisis. To maintain your independence, you may uncon-
sciously distance yourself from others.
Moon/Neptune
The Moon harbors the most sensitive, private side of your personality, while
Neptune cloaks everything in mystery. Together this pair can sensitize your
imagination — or lead you into an emotional fog.
 Conjunction: You pick up on the slightest emotional clues and often feel
overwhelmed, drained, or self-pitying. You’re vulnerable and kind, with
strong spiritual needs, definite psychic potential, and an active dream
life. This aspect indicates imagination and creative talent. It can also
produce a tendency toward escapism, alcoholism, and drug abuse.
 Harmonious aspects: Compassionate, intuitive, and caring, you find it
difficult to say no. Although this aspect increases your creativity, har-
nessing it can be difficult because you’re inclined to float off on a day-
dream. Turning fantasy into reality involves work — and that can be a
problem for you.
 Hard aspects: You struggle with wishful thinking, irrational fears (such
as hypochondria), and emotional instability, not to mention drug and
alcohol abuse. But you’re also sensitive, creative, and receptive.
Moon/Pluto
Pluto lends intensity to the emotional issues governed by the Moon. A major
aspect between these two means that your feelings are deep and your per-
ceptions are laser-sharp.
 Conjunction: You’re magnetic, controlling, possessive, intense, and com-
pulsive. You resist minor changes. But when it’s time for major changes,
you understand the need and do just fine.
183
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

 Harmonious aspects: You handle big changes with ease. You have deep
emotions and a compelling need, from time to time, to purge yourself of
old feelings. Doing so brings relief.
 Hard aspects: You’re inhibited about expressing your emotions, and you
tend to hold back. People struggle to gain your trust, and you may
manipulate situations in an effort to gain the upper hand. Occasionally,
domestic upheavals and power struggles rock your life.
Aspects to Mercury
Mercury represents the way you think, your curiosity, the way you express
yourself, and your intellect.
Mercury/Venus
Lovely Venus, the muse of the zodiac, bestows grace of expression on
Mercury’s mental gymnastics.
 Conjunction: You express yourself with charm and humor. You may have
literary ability, and you love to talk, which is lucky because you’re a con-
firmed gossip.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re alert, charming, diplomatic, and a skilled
communicator.
 Hard aspect (sort of): Mercury and Venus are never farther than 76°
apart, so they can’t form a square or opposition. But they can be semi-
square — a 45° angle that enhances your creative abilities and can stim-
ulate you to be critical of those you love the most.
Mercury/Mars
When the ruler of the intellect teams up with the planet of aggression, you
get a sharp, assertive, lawyer-like mind.
 Conjunction: You have a lively, argumentative mind, strongly held opin-
ions, and the intellectual authority to win most of your debates —
whether you know anything about the topic or not.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re forthright and mentally active, with a quick
mind and the ability to make clear decisions.
 Hard aspects: You respond immediately and sometimes recklessly. You
also have a sharp tongue and a tendency to be combative.
184
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Mercury/Jupiter
Mercury is the planet of mental abilities, while expansive Jupiter makes any-
thing bigger and better. This pair can inspire grand ideas or distracted excess.
 Conjunction: You’re smart, philosophical, open-minded, and able to see
the big picture. You ask the big questions, juggle dozens of interests, and
have the ability to influence others. Gathering information and master-
ing new skills makes you happy.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re intelligent and good-humored, optimistic
yet clear-eyed, with a variety of interests. You’re a persuasive speaker.
 Hard aspects: You’re filled with exciting ideas and good intentions. But
you tend to exaggerate and leap to conclusions, and your judgment can
be off-base.
Mercury/Saturn
Fleet-footed Mercury rules the thinking process. Demanding Saturn is the
planet of structure and self-control. They work well together if Mercury can
use Saturn’s discipline to put thoughts into action.
 Conjunction: You’re a serious person with a rational mind, a dry sense
of humor, and an appreciation for useful knowledge.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re well-organized, methodical, reserved, and
intelligent, with a natural understanding of how to focus your mind and
absorb information.
 Hard aspects: You don’t take things lightly, even when you should.
Though you’re an effective planner, you may also be inflexible, melan-
choly, and uncomfortable with new ideas.
Mercury/Uranus
Mercury represents the way you think, while Uranus is a lightning rod that
attracts inspiration from out of the blue. Depending on how the two interact,
they can bring out the brilliant inventor, the mad scientist, or the talkative
eccentric from down the street.
 Conjunction: This is the Eureka! aspect — you’re a progressive thinker
prone to sudden insights and startling ideas. You have an unconventional
mind, a novel way of expressing yourself, and even a touch of genius.
 Harmonious aspects: Unusual ideas excite you. Your mind is inventive,
unconstrained, and bright, and you express yourself in a lively and
original way.
185
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

 Hard aspects: Sometimes brilliant, sometimes just nervous and impa-
tient, you have an erratic mind. You rebel against authority, routine, and
convention, and in so doing you create tension and conflict. You also
have a spontaneous, ingenious intellect that can take you far.
Mercury/Neptune
Mercury thinks, while Neptune dreams. Mercury can help turn Neptune’s fan-
tasies into realities, while Neptune brings insight and flights of fancy to
Mercury’s ideas.
 Conjunction: You’re a visionary with an inspired imagination, a dreamer
sensitive to mood and language, and a multitalented artist and poet who
can create a mood through words alone. But when you get obsessed
with an idée fixe, you can lose touch with reality.
 Harmonious aspects: You have a discriminating mind, an artistic imagi-
nation, and an imaginative manner of expressing yourself.
 Hard aspects: Fantasy and reality vie for your attention, and it isn’t
always clear which one is winning. At your best, you’re creative, intu-
itive, and visionary. But you may also be disorganized and oblivious,
with a destructive tendency to see only what you want to see.
Mercury/Pluto
When Pluto, the zodiac’s detective, connects with quick-thinking Mercury, the
combination gives you a commanding mind and the ability to concentrate.
 Conjunction: You’re analytical, focused, and skilled at digging up
secrets. With your penetrating intelligence, you can be a gifted
researcher, investigative reporter, or detective. This aspect brings
insight and writing ability, along with obsessive thoughts.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re an astute, creative thinker who can dig
beneath the surface and who’s willing to grapple with important issues.
 Hard aspects: You’re thoughtful, observant, and curious, as well as
tense and combative, with a distinct tendency to brood.
Aspects to Venus
Venus symbolizes love, relationships, art, pleasure, possessions, and money.
Venus/Mars
Venus is the planet of allure. Mars stimulates desire. Together they stir up the
forces of passion and sensuality.
186
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Conjunction: Demonstrative and magnetic, you radiate sexuality, vitality,
and charisma. You have no trouble attracting others because people
want to be near you. But you like to see sparks fly and may uncon-
sciously create tumultuous relationships.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re attractive, genial, loving, and likely to find
romantic fulfillment.
 Hard aspects: You aren’t sure what you want, especially in romantic
relationships. As a result, your love life may be troubled by arguments,
unhappiness, and tension.
Venus/Jupiter
When amorous Venus meets generous Jupiter in a birth chart, the result is an
outpouring of affection, a love of luxury, and an appreciation of art and beauty.
 Conjunction: This is a lucky aspect. Because you’re affectionate and gen-
erous, you attract love, friendship, and even money — which is amazing,
considering how reckless, undisciplined, and self-indulgent you can be.
This aspect also confers artistic ability.
 Harmonious aspects: This fortunate aspect increases your ability to
attract attention, to make money, and to choose the right mate.
 Hard aspects: You go overboard. You may eat or drink or spend to
excess, be unreasonably demanding, or simply blow your feelings out of
proportion. One way or another, extravagance is an issue.
Venus/Saturn
Restrictive Saturn inhibits affectionate Venus. This aspect grounds and
strengthens your feelings — but also brings suffering and delays in love.
 Conjunction: Emotionally inhibited and afraid of being hurt, you take
yourself too seriously to treat romance in a lighthearted way. You’re
most comfortable in a relationship with someone older or more estab-
lished than yourself. Some people with this aspect make love a kind of
obsessive pursuit. Whether you do that or not, love is an issue for you.
This aspect also enhances creativity by helping you focus (the influence
of Saturn) your artistic talents (given by Venus).
 Harmonious aspects: Both emotionally and financially, you value secu-
rity over excitement. Responsible and loyal, you seek a solid, enduring
relationship — and a well-stocked financial portfolio.
 Hard aspects: Romance can be a struggle. Defensive and afraid of rejec-
tion, you may hide behind a wall of your own creation. Even when you
find a fulfilling relationship (and plenty of people with this aspect are
happily married), you may feel isolated and may attempt to fill that void
by taking on additional responsibilities. Something similar happens with
money. In both cases, fear of loss is a motivating factor.
187
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Venus/Uranus
If amorous Venus and unconventional Uranus link up in your birth chart,
you’re likely to be the impetuous star of your own romantic soap opera.
 Conjunction: This is the lightning-bolt aspect, the one that brings an
excitable personality, love at first sight, and a dramatic, often unstable
love life. Like Elizabeth Taylor (married eight times) or Warren Beatty
(married for the first time at age 55 after decades as Hollywood’s number
one playboy), you want instant attraction and fireworks all the way.
 Harmonious aspects: In friendship as in romance, you’re drawn to
people who are exciting and offbeat. You’re original, artistically talented,
and lucky in love. Plus, you have the enviable (but entirely unpre-
dictable) ability to attract windfalls of cash.
 Hard aspects: Looking for a reliable relationship with an “appropriate”
person? I doubt it. You seek the thrill of the forbidden. Out-of-the-blue
love is part of your story; sudden betrayal may be another. Among the
people in my files with a hard aspect between Venus and Uranus, I find
one who had an affair with her sister’s spouse, one who ran off with her
best friend’s husband, one who married her first cousin, and several who
defied expectation by marrying someone of another race or nationality.
Venus/Neptune
Venus lives for romance and beauty. Glamorous Neptune encourages mys-
tery, magic, and spiritual feelings. When they’re in sync, you can walk on air,
but even the conjunction can bring you back down to earth in a hurry.
 Conjunction: Your compassion and vivid imagination can make you an
inspired artist, but they can also get you into trouble, especially in
romance, because you unconsciously let your desire for love (or enlight-
enment) cloud your vision. You’re a romantic, an idealist, and a spiritual
seeker. Your ideal mate shares those inclinations.
 Harmonious aspects: You can be sympathetic, gentle, mystical, musical,
refined, and creative. You’re also prone to laziness and self-indulgence.
 Hard aspects: Illusion enters your life in a positive way through art,
music, and film. You’re also prone to starry-eyed infatuation. Being realis-
tic about romance isn’t your strength. You fall for Heathcliff every time.
Venus/Pluto
The planet of love meets the planet of obsession. You can guess what hap-
pens: Jealousy, intrigue, and passion are the watchwords for this pair.
 Conjunction: You’re jealous, possessive, profoundly sexual, and control-
ling. This aspect also brings artistic and financial ability.
188
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Harmonious aspects: Intense but not destructive, you successfully seek
to transform yourself through relationships. You attract powerful
people, both in love and in business.
 Hard aspects: Ever been fixated on someone you knew wasn’t good for
you? I thought so. This aspect brings passion and obsession.
Fortunately, it can also make you magnetically attractive.
Aspects to Mars
Mars represents your will, desires, drive, energy, and aggression.
Mars/Jupiter
The “will-do” energy of Mars is a perfect complement to the “can-do” energy
of Jupiter. This is an enthusiastic pairing.
 Conjunction: Why does the most famous astrological song ever written
(“Age of Aquarius,” by the Fifth Dimension) suggest that we will expe-
rience peace and love “when the Moon is in the seventh house and
Jupiter aligns with Mars”? Frankly, I’m not sure. I will say this, though:
If Jupiter aligns with Mars in your chart, you have energy to burn, an
eagerness to explore, a natural sense of timing, and the ability to fulfill
your desires in an extravagant way.
 Harmonious aspects: Setting big goals comes naturally to you. You’re
adventurous, untiring, optimistic, and stalwart — a great combination.
 Hard aspects: Restless and extravagant, you have stamina and drive, but
moderation, though frequently recommended, isn’t your way.
Mars/Saturn
Hot-blooded Mars is the planet of action; somber Saturn is the lord of cau-
tion. They don’t much like each other, but they can work together.
 Conjunction: At its best, this aspect brings self-discipline, endurance,
and courage. At its worst, it leads to shyness, inhibition, resentment,
and destructive behavior.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re ambitious, decisive, industrious, and sensi-
ble. You get things done.
 Hard aspects: Impatience does you in. You feel blocked and frustrated,
and it isn’t easy for you to regulate your moods. Plus, you feel that you
have enemies, and run-ins with authority may be all too common in your
life. This can be a difficult aspect (think of River Phoenix), but positive
examples abound, including Anderson Cooper, Jane Austen, and Johann
Sebastian Bach.
189
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Mars/Uranus
Impatient Mars and unpredictable Uranus: the original bad-boy combination
of the zodiac. These two just can’t help stirring up trouble.
 Conjunction: You’re unrestrained and determined, with unconventional
sexual attitudes, unusual desires, and great drive. But your energy is
erratic, and you may be accident-prone.
 Harmonious aspects: Nervous and outspoken, you pursue unusual goals,
seek the new, and react quickly. But do you use your considerable energy
in constructive ways, or do you fritter it away? Luckily, you have the
choice.
 Hard aspects: You’re a risk-taker and a free spirit whose rebellious ways
can disrupt everything around you. At its worst, this aspect stimulates
truly ridiculous acting-out behavior; at its creative best, it encourages
independence and adventure.
Mars/Neptune
Dreamy Neptune can spend the day in foggy reverie, while heedless Mars
takes action (however ill-thought out or ineffective). Fortunately, Mars also
fuels Neptune’s creative plans.
 Conjunction: Insecure, talented, and sensitive, you have trouble focus-
ing your energy, and you may set goals that are both idealistic and unre-
alistic. John Lennon had this aspect.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re romantic, artistic, and able to direct your
dreams and inspirations into action.
 Hard aspects: You’re idealistic but easily discouraged, with a tendency
to indulge in escapist behavior.
Mars/Pluto
You draw from a deep well of energy and intensity. This aspect brings ambi-
tion and endurance — in spades.
 Conjunction: Physically endowed with enormous reserves of energy,
you’re aggressive, ambitious, and hardworking. You go after what you
want with stunning determination. This is a powerful aspect. Example:
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 Harmonious aspects: You have strong likes and dislikes, a solid sense of
confidence, and the rare ability to end a relationship or a job without
collapsing. You also have the ability to launch a new endeavor with
amazing fervor.
190
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 Hard aspects: You have strong passions, but you also have difficulty
controlling them and avoiding conflict. Though you tend to sabotage
yourself, you have impressive stamina and the ability to eliminate your
negative behaviors and achieve what you really want: power.
Aspects to Jupiter
Jupiter represents prosperity, wisdom, abundance, extravagance, and expan-
sion. Its placement in your horoscope tells you where you can expect good
luck and opportunity.
Jupiter/Saturn
Expansive Jupiter and restrictive Saturn aren’t natural allies. Mix them
together, and you get tension — and determination.
 Conjunction: When optimistic Jupiter conjuncts pessimistic Saturn, ide-
alism gets squashed by realism, and frustration is rampant. Your path is
littered with obstacles, but your capacity for hard work is breathtaking.
This difficult aspect comes around about every 20 years. You may have
it in your birth chart if you were born in 1901, 1921, 1940 or 1941, 1961,
1981, or 2000.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re sensible, cool-headed, and practical
enough to recognize your limitations and to compensate with your
strengths. Saturn lends you the ability to turn your most extravagant
Jupiter-driven dreams into Saturnian on-the-ground realities. You can
make it happen. The best therapists I know have this aspect.
 Hard aspects: A tug of war between the forces of expansion and the
forces of restriction keeps you off balance. Restlessness, discontent, bad
timing, and tension may plague you. On some deep level, you fear that
your judgment is unreliable, and your confidence suffers accordingly.
The opposition between Jupiter and Saturn comes around approxi-
mately ten years after the conjunction: in 1911, 1930–1931, 1951–1952,
1970–1971, 1989–1990, and 2010.
Jupiter/Uranus
Surprises abound when benevolent Jupiter meets Uranus, the planet of the
unexpected. Uranus adds a maverick twist to Jupiter’s open-hearted enthusi-
asm and ability to attract opportunities.
 Conjunction: You’re an idealistic person who benefits from taking risks.
Somehow, despite your extravagant ways, you’re in the right place at the
right time. This is the aspect of unusual opportunities and sudden good
fortune — but, as with everything that Uranus touches, it may not come
in the form you would expect.
191
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

 Harmonious aspects: Alert and creative, you have an original mind and
you respond to opportunities that are exciting and off-beat.
 Hard aspects: The predetermined path and the required courses are
distasteful to you. You make startling choices and may suffer when your
impulsive decisions turn out to be less than prudent. You’re a natural
rebel.
Jupiter/Neptune
Extravagant Jupiter encourages impressionable Neptune to dream big. This
aspect enhances imagination, idealism, and spirituality.
 Conjunction: Your spirituality, idealism, and financial well-being benefit
from this aspect. But be careful that your friendly, sympathetic attitude
doesn’t blind you to reality. While you’re blessed with a certain amount
of sheer good luck, you may suffer from vagueness, self-delusion, and
the tendency to zone out.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re compassionate, gentle, insightful, creative,
and lucky, with an innate attraction to spiritual pursuits.
 Hard aspects: You tend to scatter your efforts, you can be way too
gullible, and your refusal to face reality can drive your friends to drink (a
substance you should be careful not to abuse). This aspect can bring
money and talent, especially of the musical variety. You may also be
unrealistically idealistic, and pie-in-the-sky thinking can be a problem.
Jupiter/Pluto
Jupiter brings opportunities and expands whatever it touches — the good
and the bad alike. Pluto represents the journey inward and the power of
transformation.
 Conjunction: When these two planets are cheek by jowl, you have
strong convictions and can become a powerful agent of change. One
example: Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, who has this conjunction
in the third house of communication.
 Harmonious aspects: When times of change roll around, you have the
confidence to respond, and you generally benefit. You’re well-organized
and a powerful leader.
 Hard aspects: You want to change the world. At your best, you bravely
confront the most fearsome of Goliaths — and win. But you harbor a
secret desire for power, and you can be ruthless, suspicious, self-
destructive, and fanatical. This is a powerful aspect that appears in the
charts of powerful people.
192
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Aspects to Saturn
Saturn symbolizes limitation, contraction, restriction, and the need for struc-
ture. Its placement tells you where you have to face reality, get organized, and
go to work.
Saturn/Uranus
Tradition (Saturn) meets innovation (Uranus). Boundaries (Saturn)
encounter the forces of liberation (Uranus). Needless to say, things start to
pop with this combo.
 Conjunction: You have drive, persistence, leadership potential, and the
ability to focus your most original ideas by combining the brilliance of
Uranus with the practical realities of Saturn.
 Harmonious aspects: You’re determined and decisive, able to blend the
seriousness of Saturn with the originality of Uranus. This is an aspect of
accomplishment.
 Hard aspects: Compromise is difficult. You can be egotistical, callous,
and hypocritical — a real pain in the neck. At your worst, you feel that
you have been denied the recognition, status, or material wealth you
deserve. At your best you’re a reformer, able to apply original (Uranian)
ideas to old (Saturnian) problems.
Saturn/Neptune
Practical Saturn follows directions. Dreamy Neptune wanders around in a
daze, soaking up impressions and dissolving boundaries. Depending on
whether they’re working with or against each other, they either strengthen
the forces of perception or cause you to become completely unfocused.
 Conjunction: If the two planets are well-matched, you’re disciplined, sen-
sible, and creative. If stern Saturn dominates Neptune, you distrust your
intuition and squash your creative impulses. If woozy Neptune is domi-
nant, you struggle in your efforts to be neat, organized, and in control.
 Harmonious aspects: Your Neptunian idealism and your Saturnian sense
of reality combine forces, giving you the ability to direct your imagina-
tion in a practical, real-world way.
 Hard aspects: Emotionally, you hold back. You don’t trust people easily,
and you have reclusive tendencies. Plus, you have difficulty getting orga-
nized. The placement of Saturn in your chart indicates where you need
structure. Chances are you know exactly what you should do. The trou-
ble is that, thanks to mysterious Neptune, the planet of illusion, you
have trouble doing it.
193
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

Saturn/Pluto
Pluto is a potent magician and the planet of deep, slow, internal change;
Saturn is the taskmaster of the zodiac and the lord of discipline. When they
link up in your chart, your ability to transform yourself is deepened.
 Conjunction: Pluto is all about transformation, but cautious Saturn,
which isn’t comfortable with change, restricts its action, creating 
compulsive behavior, hard-to-break habits, and a mother lode of resis-
tance. To get around this intense, sometimes frustrating aspect, you
need a systematic approach to problem-solving, a healthy dose of self-
discipline, and an acceptance of the fact that although change may be
glacial in its speed, glaciers nonetheless reshaped the world.
 Harmonious aspects: A trine or sextile linking Saturn and Pluto strength-
ens your willpower, sense of control, and confidence.
 Hard aspects: Obsessive thoughts or compulsive behavior may keep you
in their nasty grip until you find a way to lessen their power. Although
obstacles may block your way, you have the will to overcome them.
Aspects to Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto
Uranus represents individuality, eccentricity, upheaval, revolution, and the
unpredictable. Neptune symbolizes the imagination, spiritual strivings,
dreams, visions, and delusion. Pluto represents obsession, compulsion,
death, rebirth, and transformation.
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, the three outer planets, travel through the
zodiac so slowly that their greatest influence is on generations, not on indi-
viduals. The aspects that they form are in orb for a long time. A conjunction
between any two of them, for example, lasts for years. So the mere fact of
having such an aspect doesn’t distinguish you. It merely makes you a
member of your generation, with all the pluses and minuses that implies.
Under certain circumstances, an aspect involving the outer planets may rise
to prominence in the chart of an individual. That happens when:
 Either of the planets occupies an angle or is conjunct your Ascendant or
Midheaven.
 Either body makes several close aspects to other planets and in particu-
lar to the Sun, the Moon, or the ruler of your Ascendant.
 Either planet rules your Sun sign, Moon sign, or rising sign.
Uranus governs Aquarius, Neptune presides over Pisces, and Pluto rules
Scorpio.
194
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

Uranus/Neptune
Uranus, the planet of revolution, and mystical Neptune, the planet of dreams
and visions, inspire you and bring you insight.
 Conjunction: In 1992 and 1993, Uranus and Neptune were exactly con-
junct for the first time since 1821 — a trick they won’t repeat until
around 2163. Anyone born with this aspect is likely to have an inventive
approach to social change and a nervous disposition.
 Harmonious aspects: If you have a trine or a sextile between Neptune
and Uranus, you belong to a generation that’s compassionate, utopian,
and spiritually inclined.
 Hard aspects: You’re emotional, eccentric, and totally original, especially
if either planet touches a third in a significant way.
Uranus/Pluto
Unconventional Uranus and heavy-duty Pluto collaborate to promote major,
sometimes revolutionary, changes.
 Conjunction: Ever wonder why the 1960s were so turbulent? Here’s why:
For the first time in 115 years, Uranus, the planet of revolution and eccen-
tricity, was conjunct Pluto, the planet of transformation. Transiting plan-
ets affect everyone — not just babies born under their influence. If you
were born during that decade — if you’re a true child of the ’60s — you’re
independent and willful, and you carry that Woodstockian sense of cre-
ative rebellion within you.
 Harmonious aspects: Trines and sextiles between freedom-loving
Uranus and Pluto bring disruptive changes but allow you to use the
energy that’s released in creative ways.
 Hard aspects: When lightning strikes, you try to suppress your natural
reactions, thereby creating, on top of everything else, an extra measure
of anxiety. It’s not just you: This is a generational influence. Like every-
one else in your generation, you were born during America’s Great
Depression, and you’ve seen it all.
Neptune/Pluto
Visionary Neptune, monarch of the imagination, responds to dreams, music,
poetry, mysticism, and the unseen. Powerful Pluto, lord of the underworld,
plumbs the depths of the forbidden. Together, they make a mighty combo
and inspire a heroic quest.
 Conjunction: This rare conjunction, which rolled around the last time in
1892 and will not reappear until the 24th century, combines Neptunian
spirituality with the Plutonian drive for power and understanding.
Examples: Paramahansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi,
and J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings.
195
Chapter 13: Amazing Aspects: The Secrets of Cosmic Geometry

 Harmonious aspects: Since around 1928, Neptune and Pluto have been
roughly sextile, an aspect that links the mystical yearnings of Neptune
with the transformative urge of Pluto, creating an upsurge of interest in
spirituality and the occult.
 Hard aspects: An unusual concern with sexuality or the supernatural
can arise from the blocked energy of this charged aspect. Obsession is
likely — but the direction of that obsession depends on the individual.
Two examples, born a week apart, are Queen Victoria, who lent her
name to an era known for its repressive ways, and Walt Whitman, whose
poetry is suffused with joyous sexuality and uninhibited love.

A Guide to Interpreting
Your Birth Chart
In This Chapter
 Finding the patterns in your chart
 Analyzing five specific components of a chart
 Looking at aspect configurations
 Completing the puzzle
M
ost astrologers agree that Sun sign astrology, which describes types
rather than individuals, is insufficient for most purposes. But Sun sign
astrology can claim one advantage: It’s simple. A full astrological chart, on
the other hand, with its web of planets, signs, houses, and aspects, is as com-
plex as an actual human being — and just as difficult to understand.
Fortunately, you don’t have to be psychic to be an astrologer. But you do
need a system, especially when you’re starting out. This chapter provides
such a system.
Step One: Finding Overall Patterns
Leaf through a pile of birth charts, and you may notice that in some the plan-
ets are huddled together in one part of the circle, while in others they’re scat-
tered around the wheel like numbers on a clock. These groupings, which
have nothing to do with the specific planets and signs involved, can be amaz-
ingly revealing. Astrologers have developed two main ways of assessing the
configurations of an astrological chart:
 Hemisphere analysis: So easy that a child can do it, this method divides
the chart circle in half both horizontally and vertically and counts the
number of planets on each side.

 Pattern analysis: This method, pioneered by astrologer Marc Edmund
Jones in his Guide to Horoscope Interpretation, analyzes the way the plan-
ets are strewn around the wheel of the horoscope.
Both methods rely only on patterns, not on specific signs and planets.
Hemisphere analysis
A quick glance at your horoscope provides an easy entry into interpretation —
and all you have to do is count. First locate the horizon line in your chart — the
line running from the Ascendant to the Descendant, as shown in Figure 14-1.
(Turn to Chapter 11 for more on your Ascendant and Descendant.) If a large
majority of your planets — seven or more — are above the horizon, you’re an
extrovert who looks to the external world for recognition and endorsement.
If most of your planets populate the area below the line, you’re an introvert
who needs privacy, seeks personal fulfillment, and may be uncomfortable in
public life.
Now divide your chart in half vertically or along the meridian, which runs
from your Midheaven, or M.C., at the twelve o’clock spot on your chart to
your I.C. at the six o’clock spot (see Figure 14-1). That line splits the horo-
scope into two sectors: the eastern hemisphere on the left and the western
hemisphere on the right. If most of your planets lie on the eastern or left side
of the horoscope, you have the enviable ability to make things happen, to
create your own opportunities. You’re highly independent, but you may also
be intolerant of people who can’t seem to call the shots the way you can.

If your chart leans to the right, so to speak, with seven or more planets on the
western or right side of the circle, you’re more dependent on circumstances.
You need to grab the moment when it comes, and you may feel that you must
bend to the demands of others in order to succeed. Most people, including the
greatest of the great, have planets on both sides of the meridian.
The Ascendant symbolizes your surface personality. The Descendant repre-
sents your approach to marriage and partnerships. The Midheaven, or M.C.,
depicts your ambition and public image. The imum coeli, or I.C., indicates
your attitude toward home and family.
Pattern analysis
In 1941, astrologer Marc Edmund Jones (a Libran) identified seven planetary
patterns which, like hemispheric division, operate without regard to specific
signs and planets. Ever since then, students of astrology have been exploring
the meaning of those patterns. Here they are:
 The bundle: If all your planets are concentrated within four signs or
120° (a trine), you have a bundle chart, regardless of which signs are
involved or where on the wheel that bundle of planets happens to fall.
This pattern, shown in Figure 14-2, grants you a clear focus, unwavering
interests, confidence, and personal strength. It also limits you: You’re
strong where you’re strong and thoroughly unconscious (or uninter-
ested) where you aren’t. George W. Bush is an example.
Figure 14-2:
The bundle
pattern.
199
Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

 The bowl: If your planets cover more than 120° but no more than 180°
(or half the zodiac), you have a bowl chart, as shown in Figure 14-3. This
highly motivating pattern can create a frustrating feeling that something
is missing, combined with a steely determination to fill that void. These
people are activists. Examples include Abraham Lincoln, Vincent van
Gogh, Amelia Earhart, Donald Trump, and Billie Jean King.
 The bucket: A bucket chart is like a bowl except that one planet (or
sometimes two in close conjunction) is separated from the rest, as
Figure 14-4 shows. That singleton planet, the handle of the bucket,
becomes the focus of the chart. Because its needs are always para-
mount, Marc Edmund Jones compared that lone planet to a toothache. It
demands attention — and sometimes it hurts. That’s because its role is
essentially to balance the rest of the chart. Its importance is so extreme
that, both by sign and by house, it frequently describes a person in an
uncanny way.
200
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 
Two singleton sensations
Whenever you find a birth chart with a true
singleton — that is, a bucket chart with one
planet sitting apart from all the others — you
have found a key to the person. Consider these
examples from my files:
 Lulu (not her real name), the hostess with
the mostest. With three planets in charis-
matic Leo, she attracts people wherever
she goes, throws the best dinner parties
I’ve ever been invited to, and looks like the
queen of confidence. She’s also one of the
most successful, compassionate women I
know. But she has been married and
divorced several times, has had more
boyfriends than the rest of my friends com-
bined, and is obsessed with relationships.
Why? She has a bucket chart with nine
planets on the eastern side balanced by the
emotional, security-seeking Moon on the
other. Thanks to the nine planets, she’s
active and autonomous, a real doer. But
with the Moon smack in the middle of her
seventh house of partnership, her emotional
well-being revolves around relationships.
That’s what the location of the singleton
indicates: The focus of a life.
 Dr. X (not his real name), the most enter-
taining psychiatrist I know. His warm per-
sonality comes from his Leo Ascendant. His
interest in psychiatry clearly comes from his
singleton Moon which, like Dr. Freud’s
Moon, is in the eighth house of intimacy,
secrets, psychoanalysis, regeneration (or
healing), and occult knowledge. In his work
as a therapist, Dr. X is a master at creating
an easy intimacy with his patients that
allows him to unearth their secrets. In his
private life, the Moon spurs him on to
explore areas most doctors won’t admit
even thinking about — areas such as psy-
chic awareness, palmistry (his palm was
read for the first time when he was 5 years
old), astrology (that’s how we became
friends), and all manner of spiritual tech-
niques. Once again, the singleton planet is
the key.

 The locomotive: If the ten planets in your chart line up neatly over two-
thirds of the zodiac, as shown in Figure 14-5, you’ve got drive, stamina, and
practicality. The two most important planets are the first and the last —
the locomotive, which leads the planetary parade when the chart is
rotated in a clockwise direction, and the caboose, which picks up the rear.
 The splash: Just like it sounds, the planets in this pattern are sprinkled
more or less evenly around the entire wheel, with blank spots here and
there only because there are ten planets and 12 signs. Figure 14-6 shows
Figure 14-4:
The bucket
pattern.
Figure 14-3:
The bowl
pattern.
201
Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

an example of the splash pattern. With this pattern, a wealth of life
experience is yours for the grabbing. The drawback? You scatter your
energy and your interests the way a fruit tree scatters its blossoms on
a windy day.
 The splay: In this pattern, shown in Figure 14-7, the planets are distrib-
uted unevenly over the entire chart, with at least one clump of three or
more planets. People with this pattern — like Al Gore and Fidel Castro —
are individualistic, with a strong sense of their own interests and a
refusal to bow to public opinion.

The splash
pattern.

pattern.

 The seesaw: If you have two groups of opposing planets separated by a
couple of empty houses on each side, as shown in Figure 14-8, you’re
always riding up and down on the seesaw of circumstance and experi-
ence. An excellent mediator, judge, and administrator, you can view
things objectively because you’re supremely aware of the two sides of
your own nature. You may also feel internally split because you have two
sets of needs and two sets of talents, and you may find it difficult to sat-
isfy both. Examples include writer Dave Eggers and performers Frank
Sinatra, Mariah Carey, and Queen Latifah.

Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

Considering the signs
After mulling over the large patterns of hemispheric division and overall design
in your chart, you’re ready to assess the signs and planets according to ele-
ment and mode. Begin by counting the planets in each element (fire, earth, air,
and water) and in each mode (cardinal, fixed, and mutable). Table 14-1 shows
you which is which. If you know the time of your birth, include your Ascendant
and Midheaven for a total of 12 distinct components.

Most people are more or less balanced, with two to four planets in each ele-
ment. If you have five or more planets in signs of one element (or quality), the
traits associated with that element or quality are emphasized. Check out
Table 14-2 for explanations of what such an abundance may mean for you.

ate, and insightful
When classifying the components of a chart, keep in mind that the Sun,
Moon, and Ascendant are more influential than the other placements and
therefore deserve extra weight. Some astrologers even count them twice, just
to make sure they get their due.
204
Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

The modes (or qualities) work the same way as the elements. Most people
have a rough balance. But if you have a pileup of planets in one particular
mode, those traits are emphasized. Table 14-3 tells you more.

Planets in houses: A minor point
By assuming parallels between the houses and the signs, so that the first
house is equivalent to Aries, the second house to Taurus, and so on, you can
classify the houses in revealing ways, as in Table 14-4. To consider your chart
in this way, count how many planets you have in each trio of houses.
For an example, turn to Chapter 13 and take a look at Oprah Winfrey’s chart.
With three planets in the second house, one in the sixth house, and two in
the tenth, a majority of her planets are in the houses of substance, which
might help explain how an idealistic Aquarian got to be one of the richest
women on the planet.

Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

Although the house divisions from Table 14-4 don’t endow you with the same
abilities and characteristics that the signs possess, they direct your interests
in ways that can balance an otherwise out-of-whack chart.
For example, a person who has no planets in earth signs lacks practical abili-
ties (and will have to struggle to make up for that lack). The presence of plan-
ets in the second, sixth, and tenth houses can counteract that inability by
providing motivation. Such placements can’t turn an aspiring poet into an
accountant with an investment portfolio and a 401(k). But they can stimulate
the poet to find some form of security (from planets in the second house), to
get organized (from planets in the sixth house), and to seek public recogni-
tion (from planets in the tenth house).
You can also find parallels between the houses and the qualities, or modes,
as outlined in Table 14-5.

Cadent (mutable) Houses
Thoughtful, flexible
Astrologers traditionally view the angular houses (particularly the first and
the tenth) as the strongest, while cadent houses (especially the sixth and the
twelfth) are thought to be the weakest. As someone with many cadent plan-
ets, I always found that analysis discouraging until I learned about Michel
Gauquelin, a French scientist who found statistical significance in certain
planetary placements. Gauquelin noted the following trends:
 Aggressive Mars is often prominent in the horoscopes of successful
athletes.
 The Moon, ruler of mood and instinct, plays an important role in writers’
horoscopes.
 Somber Saturn, the lord of structure and consistency, is conspicuous in
the charts of scientists.
 Jovial Jupiter, the planet of extravagance, is prominent in the horo-
scopes of actors.
These planets were often located in areas of the horoscope sometimes known
as the Gauquelin zones. Those areas of power include large portions of the
cadent houses, with the twelfth and the ninth ranking as the most important.
Despite traditional astrology, which states otherwise, cadent planets aren’t
necessarily weak at all.

Step Two: Five Main Components
of a Birth Chart
After looking at the overall patterns of your chart, you’re ready to check out
the specific signs and planets. To get a sense of your chart without drowning
in detail, concentrate on these factors:
 The Sun: The Sun determines your basic identity — your motivations,
needs, will, and individuality. Its sign describes the way you express
these important aspects of yourself. Its house determines the area of
greatest concern to you as well as the area in which you can most effec-
tively express yourself.
 The Moon: The Moon describes your emotions, subconscious, instincts,
habits, and memory. The sign it’s in determines the way you experience
the emotional side of your nature. Its placement by house points to the
area of life that’s most essential to your emotional well-being.
 The rising sign or Ascendant: The Ascendant describes the surface
level of your personality — the face you show the world. (See Chapter
11 for more about rising signs.)
 The ruling planet: The planet that rules your Ascendant is the ruler of
your chart, regardless of its location and regardless of anything else hap-
pening in your horoscope. As the ruler, it contributes both to your sense
of self and to the impression you give others. Table 14-6 shows you the
rising signs and their ruling planets. Turn to Chapter 9 or 10 for more
insight into your ruling planet.

One of the most revealing qualities of the ruling planet is its position by
house. For instance, Jay Leno is Aquarius rising (which may explain his
bizarre hair as well as his love of machinery); his ruling planet, Uranus, 
is in the fifth house of entertainment. Courtney Love has Libra rising. Her
ruling planet, Venus (of course), is in the eighth house of sex and death.
Winona Ryder has Sagittarius rising; her ruling planet is Jupiter, which
can be found hiding out in her twelfth house of self-undoing. And so it
goes. Now, don’t get me wrong: This quick and dirty method doesn’t
always work in such a blatant way. But it does provide a clue to the
understanding of a chart, and its message shouldn’t be ignored. No
matter what your ruling planet is, its house position has an influence 
on you. Table 14-7 tells how this important factor affects you.

 Stelliums: A cluster of three or more planets in the same sign, and
preferably in the same house, is known as a stellium (or, in England, a
satellitium). Such a grouping is automatically important. When it appears
in the same sign as the Sun, it reinforces the message of that sign. When
it shows up in another sign, it adds an extra set of qualities and influ-
ences that can rival the Sun sign in importance.
The size of the stellium also makes a difference. Normally, a stellium
consists of three or four planets. Seldom do you see more. But occa-
sional planetary pileups produce monstrous stelliums, as in the case of
the TV cook Rachael Ray (who has seven planets plus the Ascendant in
Virgo) or the actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose extraordinary birth
chart features seven planets, including the Sun and the Moon, in
Aquarius. The scary intensity she portrays in her acting comes directly
from the power of that stellium.
Step Three: Looking for Aspect Patterns
A birth chart can easily have two dozen aspects in it. Fortunately, some are
more important than others. The aspects that deserve the closest attention
are those that are the tightest, those that involve the Sun or the Moon, and
those that weave three or more planets into a single pattern, as in these con-
figurations:
 The Grand Trine: Three planets, each at a 120° angle to the other two,
form a giant good-luck triangle called a Grand Trine, shown in Figure 14-9.
Figure 14-9:
A Grand
Trine.
209
Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

A perfect Grand Trine always includes at least one planet in each sign of
a given element. In those areas of life, energy flows and opportunities
are abundant. For example, pop artist Andy Warhol was an attention-
grabbing Leo with a Grand Trine in fire: His Moon and Uranus were in
Aries, his Sun was in Leo, and his Saturn was in Sagittarius. Like most
people, Andy Warhol had other areas in his chart that offered plenty of
difficulties. But he used his Grand Trine to his advantage, both artisti-
cally (thanks to Saturn in the fifth house of creativity) and socially
(thanks to his high-spirited Sun sign). You can take a look at his chart in
Chapter 19.
Not everyone fortunate enough to have this aspect uses it so effectively.
The Grand Trine, a symbol of the slacker, is notorious for bringing just
enough good luck to keep you from feeling that you have to exert yourself.
 The Grand Cross: If two sets of planets in your chart oppose (or square)
each other, as shown in Figure 14-10, you have your hands full. The
Grand Cross is a relatively rare aspect that symbolizes tension, obstruc-
tion, and frustration.
Some people are overwhelmed by a Grand Cross. Think of Nicole Brown
Simpson, O.J. Simpson’s murdered wife, whose chart was positively
overflowing with squares. But the Grand Cross can also be a source of
incredible commitment, courage, and energy — as in the charts of Miles
Davis, Stonewall Jackson, and Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker’s
Guide to the Galaxy.
Figure 14-10:
A Grand
Cross.

Part III: Everything Else in the Cosmic Cookbook 

 The T-square: When two planets oppose each other with a third planet
square to both, as shown in Figure 14-11, they form a T-square — a
restless, troublesome, but fairly common configuration. A T-square
inevitably creates tension and dissatisfaction. It also motivates you to
do something about your situation, which may be why so many success-
ful people have T-square configurations. Oprah is one of them. Turn to
her chart in Chapter 13. You’ll see a classic T-square involving four plan-
ets: Pluto in Leo, Saturn in Scorpio, and the Sun and Venus in Aquarius.
 The Yod, Finger of Fate, or Hand of God: Sounds serious, doesn’t it?
Actually, this difficult-to-spot configuration, shown in Figure 14-12, is
subtler in action than the other aspect patterns. It looks like a long,
narrow triangle, with two planets at its base forming a sextile (a 60° angle)
and a third at the apex, or peak, forming a 150° angle to the other two.
That 150° aspect, also called a quincunx or inconjunct, has a stop-and-go
energy that creates false starts, backslides, and frustrations. It demands
continual adjustment and impairs your decision-making abilities, espe-
cially in the areas affected by the planet at the apex. This aspect sets
up complex dynamics within a chart. But is it lethal? No. Is it a sign of
special favor from God? No. Do plenty of successful people have this
aspect? Yes. (Try Meryl Streep, Winston Churchill, Quincy Jones, and
Leonardo da Vinci.) Don’t let the name of this aspect unhinge you.
Figure 14-11:
A T-Square.

Chapter 14: A Guide to Interpreting Your Birth Chart

Step Four: Putting the Puzzle Together
Before you reach any wild conclusions about a chart (especially your own),
make sure you’ve looked at everything, including the planets, the aspects, the
Ascendant and Midheaven, the houses (including the ones that are empty),
and anything else you can think of. For example, if asteroids interest you, by
all means check them out. One of the most fascinating parts of astrology is
that there’s always something new to look at in a chart.
And yet you may discover that the more you delve into your chart, the more
the information seems to repeat itself. You’ll also unearth a few contradictions:
Everyone has them in their charts, just as everyone has them in their psyches.
You’ll also find the occasional placement or aspect that doesn’t gel with the
rest of the horoscope or that simply doesn’t fit the person in front of you.
(Don’t toss it out too quickly, especially if you’re completing a chart for a friend
or acquaintance. Your discomfort could be an indication that you don’t know
this person half as well as you think you do.)
After you weigh all these factors, you’ll notice that certain characteristics
seem to pop up everywhere. It’s amazing how in every chart, a few themes
wind their way through the entire chart. No matter where you begin — with
the hemisphere balance or the element countdown, with the Sun sign or with
that peculiar stellium in the fifth house — the same theme keeps coming
around again and again. And the entire chart starts to click into place. That’s
when you know you’re becoming an astrologer.

P

application of astrology. It can also help you under-

for maximum benefit. In this part, I discuss all that. I also

The Sun Sign Combinations
In This Chapter

 Checking out your chances
 Going beyond the Sun
A
strology does not judge. All 12 signs are equally worthy. That’s the offi-
cial line. In reality, everyone has preferences. Peering out from within
the confines of your own horoscope, you can’t help feeling that some signs
are easier to get along with than others. In this chapter, I talk about the Sun
sign combinations — the ones that feel natural from day one, and the ones
that make you crazy. “How do I love thee?” There are 78 ways — one for each
pair of Sun signs.
In the pages that follow, I talk about each combination under the sign that
comes first in the zodiac. If you’re a fiery Aries and your beloved is a peace-
loving Libra, turn to Aries for a description of the dynamics of your relation-
ship. And if you’re a sentimental Pisces involved with a workaholic Virgo,
look up your relationship under that sign. Since Pisces is the last sign in
the zodiac, every relationship you have (except for one with a fellow fish)
is classified under the other sign. It may not be fair. But that’s the way it is.
Aries in Love
Lusty and exuberant, you’re passionate, idealistic, and devoted, especially
when you’re in love. You’re also impatient, and you don’t like to feel hemmed
in. Lovers who try to control your behavior quickly lose favor with you, as do
friends who call too often or demand too much intimacy. Here’s how you do
with other signs of the zodiac:
 Aries + Aries: Think of chili peppers, saxophones, and volcanoes —
everything hot. This fast-moving, action-oriented, competitive combo
leads to fireworks — both when you want them and when you don’t.
Example: Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker.

 Aries + Taurus: The impetuous Ram is feisty, motivated, and hot-to-trot;
the steady, stubborn, seductive Bull is unhurried and immovable. As
with all next-door-neighbor combinations, the differences in style and
tempo can drive you crazy. Example: Spencer Tracy (Aries) and
Katharine Hepburn (Taurus).
 Aries + Gemini: You’re both high-spirited and easily bored, with a mil-
lion interests and a love for activities of all sorts. Aries is straightfor-
ward and physical, while inconstant Gemini lives in his or her head.
Nonetheless, this is a terrific combo. Example: Warren Beatty (Aries)
and Annette Bening (Gemini).
 Aries + Cancer: You’re both dynamic and expressive. Cancer is sensitive
and fearful, while hot-tempered Aries is dominating, spontaneous, and
courageous. But Aries isn’t tuned in emotionally — to the continual frus-
tration of the moody, intuitive Crab.
 Aries + Leo: Two fire signs together generate a lot of warmth. Except for
occasional outbursts of ego by either party, it doesn’t get any better
than this merry, high-spirited match. Example: Jennifer Garner (Aries)
and Ben Affleck (Leo).
 Aries + Virgo: The rambunctious Ram prefers to leap first and look later;
the inhibited Virgin wants to mull things over. Aries says it like it is,
direct and to the point; analytical Virgo thinks before speaking and tries
to be sensitive (but often fails). Both signs have legitimate complaints
about the other. Example: Tabitha (Aries) and Stephen King (Virgo).
 Aries + Libra: Opposites attract in this combo. Aries brings impassioned
energy, curiosity, and enthusiasm to the mix; Libra adds intelligence,
courtesy, and charm. Even though the differences between you aren’t to
be dismissed — Aries is spontaneous and direct while Libra is thought-
ful and restrained — this is nonetheless a recipe for romance.
 Aries + Scorpio: Sexually, this combo is off the charts. But dashing Aries
is straightforward, while jealous Scorpio is anything but. As a rule, this
pairing is asking for trouble.
 Aries + Sagittarius: Two fire signs egging each other on makes for a clas-
sic high-energy, good-time combo, assuming that you don’t burn your-
selves out. Even though the fights may be fierce, laughter gets you
through — unless it doesn’t, in which case neither of you has the
patience to patch things up.
 Aries + Capricorn: The Goat initially gets off on the adventure of being
with such a reckless, blustery creature. But Capricorns are relentlessly
grown-up, and Rams are perpetual adolescents overflowing with gusto
and half-baked plans. Most of the time, the thrill fades.
 Aries + Aquarius: Although these two signs are sextile, this isn’t as
happy a duo as you might expect. Visionary Aquarius is thinking about
the future; Aries is brash, bold, and be-here-now. A strong Venus/Mars
tie can be a big help.
216
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Aries + Pisces: The fluid, sympathetic Fish can tame the dominating
Ram for a while. But what happens at the inevitable moment when emo-
tional Pisces needs a little nurturing? The Ram is on the lam. Protect
yourself, Pisces. Look elsewhere.
If you’re in love with an Aries, don’t be shy, subtle, or hesitant. Flirt boldly.
Suggest something casual and spur-of-the-moment. Leave no doubt in Aries’
mind that you’re interested. If your efforts fall flat, pull back instantly and try
being unavailable. Above all, don’t beg, plead, or whine. Aries has no
patience for small-time behavior or any form of neediness.
Taurus in Love
Possessive, faithful, and not always as mellow as you’d like to be, you require
physical contact, emotional and financial security, and domestic comfort.
Once you find someone who shares your sensuality and basic values, you’re
content. You can happily while away your time just being together, doing
nothing. Troubles arise when your partner wants a change of pace. Inevitably,
you resist. You’re the immovable object. Learn to bend.
 Taurus + Taurus: Assuming one of you has the gumption to make the
first move, this could be a long-term love-in. But when disagreements
emerge, you lock horns. You’ll encounter big passion and big fights, but
this combo is a definite go.
 Taurus + Gemini: Effervescent Gemini loosens up the stolid Bull. Gemini
loves change and jumps into it without hesitation, while conservative
Taurus is uncomfortable with change and tries to avoid it. As always,
neighboring signs can be problematic. Check for Mercury, Venus, or the
Moon in each other’s signs.
 Taurus + Cancer: Welcome home. Taurus is sensual, loving, and security-
minded; Cancer is intuitive, nurturing, and security-minded. A perfect,
harmonious match.
 Taurus + Leo: Reliable Taurus wants to have a normal life, a regular bed-
time, and a growing bank account. Demanding Leo wants to live large.
And neither of you gives an inch.
 Taurus + Virgo: You both value practical solutions, even if sensible
Taurus takes longer to get there than efficient Virgo. In addition to shar-
ing values, comfort-loving Taurus calms Virgo’s frazzled nerves, while
goal-oriented Virgo prods Taurus into action. A fine combination.
 Taurus + Libra: You’re both ruled by sexy Venus, yet what a difference
there is between you! Intellectual Libra values refinement, music, soft
lighting; earthy Taurus wants to skip the preliminaries and get to it.
When the thrill of the moment fades, you have little to say to each other.
217
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

 Taurus + Scorpio: Passion’s playground. Scorpio bubbles over with
erotic ideas; Taurus goes along. Scorpio’s love of secrecy, melodrama,
and control receives a cooler welcome from the Bull, who moves slowly
and is considerably more upfront. When troubles arise, you’re equally
stubborn. Example: Jessica Lange (Taurus) and Sam Shepard (Scorpio).
 Taurus + Sagittarius: Sexually, you’re a match, at least for a while.
Otherwise, you’re so different it’s astonishing that you ever got together
at all. Sagittarius collects frequent-flyer miles, wants more than the usual
amount of personal space, and hungers for stimulation; Taurus gardens,
needs loads of cuddling (and a cozy den), and loves to stay home,
making this a difficult combo.
 Taurus + Capricorn: A fine match you’ve got here. You have similar
values, an appreciation for physical comfort, a desire for financial 
prosperity, a shared work ethic, and a frequently reinforced belief in the
healing power of sex. Example: Coretta Scott King (Taurus) and Martin
Luther King, Jr. (Capricorn).
 Taurus + Aquarius: Airy, eccentric Aquarius is all about ideas; conserva-
tive, stable Taurus is rooted in the real world. Both are rigid. This isn’t a
good long-term prospect, despite the notable example of Alice B. Toklas
(Taurus) and Gertrude Stein (Aquarius). (For more about this couple,
flip to the sidebar “Incompatible? You be the judge.”)
 Taurus + Pisces: Earthy Taurus is essentially physical; dreamy Pisces is
metaphysical. Yet these two share similar rhythms, tastes, and romantic
notions. Examples: Sid Vicious (Taurus) and Nancy Spungen (Pisces),
Robert (Taurus) and Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Pisces).
Head over heels for a Taurus? Hang around. Be patient. Avoid arguments.
Reveal no deep-seated neuroses. And give Taurus a chance to feel comfort-
able. Security is essential for Taurus. To give your Bull a safe haven, provide
rich food, soft touches, lazy afternoons, good wine, leisurely walks in the
woods, and every reason to feel relaxed. Taurus responds to scent and tex-
ture, so wear silk, velvet, cashmere, tweed — anything touchable. That’s
where Taurus lives.
Gemini in Love
Wanton Gemini, the last living proponent of casual sex, flirts outrageously,
connects easily, and moves on at warp speed when things fall apart. Because
you love variety and relish intellectual challenges, you seek out witty, up-to-
date people who share your delight in easy banter and constant stimulation.
You’re lively, enchanting, and flighty — yet another victim of the grass-is-
always-greener myth.
218
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Gemini + Gemini: Despite the overall level of nervous energy that you
generate together, you amuse and engage one another. And you never
have to deal with those bleak silences that descend on the relationships
of others. This is a definite talk-fest.
 Gemini + Cancer: Easily distracted Twins are emotional lightweights,
capable of denying their feelings for years on end; moody Crabs,
Olympic gold-medal champions of the weeping event, want to connect
emotionally, preferably at home. Look for strong planetary ties because
this is ordinarily not a match made in heaven. Example: Wallis Simpson
(Gemini) and Edward VIII (Cancer).
 Gemini + Leo: These two playful revelers truly enjoy each other. But
they may unconsciously compete for center stage, which Leo requires
and Gemini, an incessant talker, hates to relinquish. Also, Leo is loyal to
a fault, while Gemini . . . well, consider this example: John F. Kennedy
(Gemini) and Jacqueline Kennedy (Leo).
 Gemini + Virgo: Smart and tart, you click immediately and you can’t
stop talking. But Gemini believes in free association and the benefits of
serendipity, while Virgo is the mindset behind Mapquest. Ultimately, you
get on each other’s nerves.
 Gemini + Libra: This wonderful combination promotes affectionate flirt-
ing and conversation that never stops. Even though it isn’t the most pas-
sionate liaison, by and large you can’t go wrong. Example: Paul
McCartney (Gemini) and Linda Eastman (Libra).
 Gemini + Scorpio: Scorpio considers sex the central mystery of life.
Gemini, a lustier sign than is often acknowledged, enjoys it without get-
ting all emotional about it. Soon jealous Scorpio is feeling wounded,
while flighty Gemini, now immersed in the crossword puzzle, can’t help
wondering what the problem is. Example: Nicole Kidman (Gemini) and
Keith Urban (Scorpio).
 Gemini + Sagittarius: Despite an occasional bout of head-butting, this
freedom-loving, loquacious pair is on the same wavelength. Advice: Fill
your schedules with varied activities and plenty of travel; pile reading
material and notebooks on the bedside tables; and don’t get hung up on
togetherness, because that’s not where this independent couple lives.
Example: Angelina Jolie (Gemini) and Brad Pitt (Sagittarius).
 Gemini + Capricorn: Somber Capricorns take themselves seriously;
easygoing Geminis, though self-absorbed, take things lightly and are
always trotting off in new directions. Not an easy combo. Examples:
Jean-Paul Sartre (Gemini) and Simone de Beauvoir (Capricorn), Johnny
Depp (Gemini), and Vanessa Paradis (Capricorn).
219
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

 Gemini + Aquarius: You may be soul mates. You’re both sociable and
fun-loving, and you both have hyperactive minds (though Aquarius wants
to discuss social issues, while Gemini has ideas about less highfalutin’
topics). Neither of you is in touch emotionally, so when times are tough,
the glue that holds you together may weaken.
 Gemini + Pisces: Laid-back Pisces wants to sleep in; Gemini likes to get
an early start. Mystical Pisces wants to analyze your dreams; Gemini
prefers to explore the blogosphere. You come from different planets.
Clashes are inevitable, but you’re both able to bend. Examples: Laurie
Anderson (Gemini) and Lou Reed (Pisces).
If a Gemini is on your mind, be upbeat, up-to-date, unpredictable, and avail-
able. Gemini is quick-witted, curious, well-informed, and game for anything.
To capture Gemini’s attention, exhibit those same qualities. Don’t be morose.
Don’t bemoan the sad state of affairs in the world today. Don’t complain.
Don’t demand that your dates be scheduled weeks in advance. Above all,
remember that Gemini values lively conversation. Wonder why Geminis have
a reputation for infidelity? It’s because they’re so easily bored.
Cancer in Love
Cancer has a talent for intimacy and caring. When you’re in love, you blithely
ignore the most obvious flaws while homing in on your beloved’s hidden
potential. Loving, generous, sentimental, and maternal, you need to be with
someone who shares your drive and your willingness to explore complex
emotional issues. When you find such a person, you’re totally supportive —
even when the reverse isn’t true. You also have a tendency to cling. The
smothering mother is a Cancerian archetype for good reason: Sometimes you
can’t let go, not even a teensy bit.
 Cancer + Cancer: You’re intuitive and responsive, with plenty of energy
and drive. Give it a go. But remember: Emotions run high during full
Moons, and you both feel the pull. Examples: Rogers and Hammerstein,
Barnum and Bailey, literary critics Diana and Lionel Trilling.
 Cancer + Leo: The domineering Lion loves passion, adventure, and five-
star hotels; the moody Crab wants a quieter life in a cozy cottage covered
in vines. If Leo is willing to downsize expectations and Cancer is ready to
stroke the Lion’s fragile ego and take a chance, you can find common
ground. Examples: Kevin Bacon (Cancer) and Kyra Sedgwick (Leo).
 Cancer + Virgo: After you establish some trust, Cancer helps Virgo relax,
and Virgo helps Cancer feel more secure. Problems arise with emotional
issues. Supersensitive Cancer wants to discuss feelings, while critical
Virgo prefers to skip the emotional stuff (unless it can be approached in
a calm and systematic way) and make practical plans.
220
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Cancer + Libra: Domestic Cancer and artistic Libra have a fabulous time
decorating a house together. But Cancer’s emotional sensitivities cause
logical Libra to pull back. Like other signs that square each other, this
isn’t a simpatico pairing, though Libra’s desire to be mated — combined
with Cancer’s need to nest — can be a mitigating factor.
 Cancer + Scorpio: You’re both in touch with your feelings and in love with
love. You probably have a deeply intuitive relationship, though problems
may arise when Scorpio can’t cope with the quick ebb and flow of
Cancerian emotions. Scorpio feelings, while deep, change slowly; Cancer
feelings are in constant flux. Examples: Tom Hanks (Cancer) and Rita
Wilson (Scorpio), Princess Diana (Cancer) — or Camilla Parker-Bowles
(Cancer) — and Prince Charles (Scorpio).
 Cancer + Sagittarius: Cancer wants to love, nourish, and possess;
Sagittarius can’t be possessed. Though you may love each other intensely,
you’re completely different. Be warned. Examples: Frida Kahlo (Cancer)
and Diego Rivera (Sagittarius), Tom Cruise (Cancer) and Katie Holmes
(Sagittarius).
 Cancer + Capricorn: Like every pair of opposites, this one has pluses 
and minuses. Moody Cancer has an intuitive sense for how things ought
to be done; sensible Capricorn prefers to go by the book. That’s a small
difference, given that Capricorn helps Cancer feel protected, Cancer helps
Capricorn feel loved, and you share a reverence for tradition and family.
 Cancer + Aquarius: Warm, nurturing Cancer with cool, detached
Aquarius? Not recommended, though some couples have defied the
odds. Example: Nancy (Cancer) and Ronald Reagan (Aquarius).
 Cancer + Pisces: You’re equally sensitive. Great feeling flows between
you, your rhythms are similar, and you may even share a rare psychic
connection. This is a perfect match, though Cancer, who loves to rescue,
may find it difficult to overcome the famed Piscean ability to self-
destruct. Examples: George Sand (Cancer) and Frederic Chopin (Pisces),
Courtney Love (Cancer) and Kurt Cobain (Pisces).
If you fall for a Cancer, think roses, kisses, chocolate, and candlelight. A
monogamist at heart, Cancer is tender and amorous — the real deal. Go to
the ocean. Go dancing. Go anywhere by moonlight. Some signs do these
things because they think they should. Cancerians do them because they
respond to these traditional symbols — and because they crave intimacy.
Three suggestions: Ask about your Crab’s entire family tree; prove that you
can cook; and be willing to discuss your emotions — in glorious detail.
Leo in Love
Uninhibitedly sexual, you’re romantic, generous, witty, manipulative, loyal,
and, despite your confident appearance, desperately in need of love. When
221
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

someone wins your heart, you want that person in your life forever. But you
demand to be wooed in just the right way, insist on holding the reins of
power, and can be interfering and controlling. Despite your bad behavior,
you’re so radiant and likable that you get away with everything.
 Leo + Leo: You have big, theatrical personalities, and your house is filled
with laughter. But you also have big, thirsty egos in need of constant
infusions of applause and praise. Sexually, you’re dynamite. Still, the
question remains: Who’s the king of this castle? A tough call. Example:
Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith.
 Leo + Virgo: Flamboyant Leo makes grand gestures; uptight Virgo
focuses on details. This isn’t an easy duo. Ideally, one or both of you has
at least one planet in the other’s sign to bridge the considerable dis-
tance between you. Example: Jennifer Lopez (Leo with Venus in Virgo)
and Marc Anthony (Virgo with Mars in Leo).
 Leo + Libra: Libra is a flirt; Leo likes to play games — it works. Though
Leo is more dramatic than even-tempered Libra, these two stimulate and
delight each other. Example: Zelda (Leo) and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Libra).
 Leo + Scorpio: Leo blazes, Scorpio burns; both are drama queens. Fiery,
intense, entertaining, and involving, this passionate, complicated
alliance generates good times and major battles — fire and ice.
Examples: Ted Hughes (Leo) and Sylvia Plath (Scorpio), Arnold
Schwarzenegger (Leo) and Maria Shriver (Scorpio), Bill (Leo) and Hillary
Rodham Clinton (Scorpio).
 Leo + Sagittarius: This fiery, exuberant combo offers laughter galore, an
abundance of passion, and shared adventures in the world at large.
Loyal Leo, who wants to do everything together, should remember that
free-wheeling Sagittarius needs to be let off the leash once in a while,
and upfront Sagittarius has to get used to the fact that melodramatic Leo
needs to be a star.
 Leo + Capricorn: Flamboyant Leo loves grand gestures, overstated emo-
tions, and dramatic scenarios. Conservative Capricorn prefers to stay
cool by underplaying his or her reactions. But they both adore luxurious
surroundings and the finer things in life. If you have plenty of money,
this match can work.
 Leo + Aquarius: If expressive Leo can accept the Water Bearer’s eccen-
tric ways (and friends) and if freedom-loving Aquarius has no problem
showering the needy Lion with adoration, this can be a match. Leo must
also give up some control though, because Aquarius resists being mar-
shaled into someone else’s plan.
 Leo + Pisces: Pisces is bewitched by the fiery confidence of the auda-
cious Lion, who in turn is swept away by the expressive, impractical
Fish. Initially, quixotic Pisces feels protected by Leo (who wants to make
everything okay). But in the end, the Fish (who has screwed things up in
a way that Leo can scarcely believe) feels criticized and judged. Leave
this relationship alone.

Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

To capture the heart of a Leo, look great, exude confidence, and open your
wallet. Leo expects flowers after the first date, and after that the stakes rise.
It’s not a matter of greed; Leo just wants to be sure of your feelings. So don’t
think that you can get away with second-class goods — Leo knows the differ-
ence. Plus, Leo is a glutton for affection, attention, and compliments. You
can’t be too brazen — Leo frogs think they’re princes; Leo princes think
they’re kings; Leo kings think they’re gods. You can’t lay it on too thick.
Virgo in Love
You’re understanding, easy to talk to, and far sexier than your virginal symbol
suggests. But your idealistic standards are impossibly high, and mere mortals
have trouble making the cut. When someone does prove worthy, you’re
warm, worshipful, devoted, and helpful. Unfortunately, you often have to
learn the hard way that well-meaning suggestions and advice, no matter how
gently delivered, pack a terrible punch.
 Virgo + Virgo: Your minds work in similar ways. Assuming your perfec-
tionist compulsions can coexist, this is a happy, healthy union.
 Virgo + Libra: Analytical Virgo and thoughtful Libra connect mentally.
But efficient, industrious Virgo aims for perfection, while ever-so-slightly
lazy Libra needs more down time and yearns for romance even when
there’s laundry to be done. As always with neighboring signs, look for
planets in the other person’s sign. Example: Jada Pinkett Smith (Virgo
with Venus in Libra) and Will Smith (Libra with Mars in Virgo).
 Virgo + Scorpio: This is an admirable match. Virgo is earthy enough to
satisfy Scorpio’s lustier moments, while Scorpio, a skilled detective who
loves to dig into the meanings of things, can meet Virgo on his or her own
intellectual ground. Example: Mary Matalin (Virgo) and James Carville
(Scorpio).
 Virgo + Sagittarius: A sizzling, erotic charge runs between you, and you
connect mentally. But extravagant Sagittarius likes to talk big and deal
with the small stuff later (if at all), while prudent Virgo prefers to keep it
real and attend to the details. After the initial fascination fades, the dif-
ferences may be too great to overcome, as is often the case with two
signs that square each other.
 Virgo + Capricorn: Two signs of the same element understand each
other. You have great rapport, no effort required. You’re both practical,
methodical, accomplished, and ardent. This match is an excellent bet for
a durable and congenial relationship.
 Virgo + Aquarius: Virgo’s unique, well-stocked mind excites brilliant
Aquarius, whose rebellious ways help virtuous Virgo loosen up. You
have fun together, and you click intellectually. But neither of you is at
223
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

home in the gooey realm of emotions, meaning that when problems
come up in that sphere, you both feel ill at ease. 
 Virgo + Pisces: You fascinate each other because you’re polar opposites.
Virgo needs order, schedules, and reasons. Intuitive Pisces reacts
instinctively and has a deep and abiding attraction to chaos. Naturally,
Virgo wins the arguments. But easygoing Pisces has ways of not going
along at all. It’s a contest of equals: Anal-compulsive meets passive-
aggressive.
To entice a Virgo, admire his intelligence; bring articles; engage in word play;
and flatter his astute mind. Between the sheets, Virgo can be absolutely red-
hot, but Virgo is also a control freak — as uptight as they come. So avoid
messy emotions. In fact, avoid messes of all kinds. And remember: Virgo is
always concerned about appropriate behavior and proper appearance, so no
affection in public, please.
Libra in Love
You’re gregarious, attractive, and a natural flirt. Born to be mated, you’re
restrained in public, amorous in private, and thoroughly identified with the
object of your affection. As a single person, you’re romantic, charming, and
popular. But being part of a duo is essential to your fulfillment, and ultimately
you’re happy to leave the dating life behind.
 Libra + Libra: The downside to this duo is that if you feel ambivalent
about the same issues, you can flounder in indecision forever. Otherwise,
you’re both creative, courteous, logical, and likable. This is a conversa-
tion that never stops. Example: Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon.
 Libra + Scorpio: Although these two signs share a longing for romance,
Scorpio craves emotional intensity and melodrama, while even-handed
Libra yearns for serenity. Unless Libra has planets in Scorpio, the initial
attraction is strong, but the long-term connection isn’t.
 Libra + Sagittarius: Though the independent Archer’s need for adven-
ture may cause Libra a few jealous moments, Libra’s charm reels the
wandering gypsy back in. A fine pairing despite the weirdness of this
example: Soon-yi Previn (Libra) and Woody Allen (Sagittarius).
 Libra + Capricorn: Old-fashioned romance appeals to you both, and you
adore being part of a couple. But you both tend to repress emotions.
When issues arise, as they inevitably do, the challenge is to admit that
there’s a problem and to deal with it.
224
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Libra + Aquarius: You could talk all night. Your mental connection is
extraordinary. Other aspects of love leave something to be desired. Look
for a strong Mars/Venus tie. John Lennon (Libra) and Yoko Ono
(Aquarius) didn’t have that planetary bond. But her Ascendant in his
Sun sign and his Moon in her Sun sign helped knit them together.
 Libra + Pisces: You seem to be soul mates, but you aren’t. Mysterious
Pisces is a seething mass of soul, and Libra, though temptingly romantic
on the surface, is cool, calm, and uncomfortable with emotions. After a
while, the sensitive Fish feels ignored, while Libra, never the energy cap-
ital of the zodiac, feels exhausted.
In love with a Libra? Be smart, stylish, cultured, and good-looking. Take Libra
to scenic places — Libra melts in the presence of natural beauty. Try not to
be needy (Libra responds only when it matters, so don’t cry wolf) or jealous
(Libra flirts like mad and attracts admirers everywhere). And don’t be loud or
lewd: Libra can’t stand it. They can stand healthy disagreement, though. In
fact, they often thrive on it. That’s because Libra is actually looking for a rela-
tionship, not a clone.
Scorpio in Love
You’re intense, devoted, and fascinated by the game of love. You think of
romance in mythic terms, demand grand passion (sexually and otherwise),
and often fall into the quicksand of obsession. Because you radiate sex appeal
and have such a compelling presence, other people often become fixated on
you. (Note, however, that though Scorpio has a well-deserved reputation as
the sexiest sign in the zodiac, many Scorpios also struggle with sexual prob-
lems that range from sexoholic excess to impotence, with a full complement of
bizarre detours in between.) Still, the bottom line is this: You expect love (and
sex) to transform you — and that’s exactly what happens.
 Scorpio + Scorpio: Communication is eerily easy, and sex is erotic
beyond imagining. But should there be even a hint of suspicion or jock-
eying for power, the psychic warfare is unbearable. This can be a match
for the ages, or an exercise in tortured excess. Example: Larry and
Althea Flynt.
 Scorpio + Sagittarius: Scorpio is complicated and covert; Sagittarius is
direct and honest. Scorpio seeks total immersion; Sagittarius wants inde-
pendence. The Sun signs are stunningly different. But when at least one
partner has planets in the other’s sign, the attraction is compelling.
Examples: Pablo Picasso (Scorpio with the Moon in Sagittarius) and
Françoise Gilot (Sagittarius).
225
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

 Scorpio + Capricorn: These serious, lusty signs seem different because
Scorpio dives deep into the tropical sea of emotion, while Capricorn,
though prone to sulking, prefers to skate lightly on the frozen surface. In
fact, Scorpio gives Capricorn permission to have feelings, Capricorn pro-
tects the ever-emotive Scorpio, and you both feel like you have come
home. Example: Mike Nichols (Scorpio) and Diane Sawyer (Capricorn).
 Scorpio + Aquarius: Fixed signs don’t submit easily. Then again, you
don’t respect people who do. The problem is that Scorpio seeks attach-
ment, is absorbed by emotional complexity, and leads from the heart,
while Aquarius, however mentally vibrant, prefers a little emotional dis-
tance. This is a volatile mix. Example: Demi Moore (Scorpio) and Ashton
Kutcher (Aquarius).
 Scorpio + Pisces: You’re both sensual, intuitive, and emotionally aware.
As a rule, possessive Scorpio is more at ease with the ways of the world
than the out-of-this-world Fish. But Scorpio longs for magic, and imagina-
tive Pisces can make it happen. Examples: Goldie Hawn (Scorpio) and
Kurt Russell (Pisces).
If you’re fixated on a Scorpio, be passionate and expressive. Sing Gershwin or
Cole Porter. Invite Scorpio over to see Casablanca. Watch an eclipse together.
When the object of your affections enters your domain, exploit your home-
court advantage. Feel free to play games, to imply, and to pull back. Scorpio
loves that stuff. Be secretive, suggestive, manipulative, and ever-so-slightly
aggressive — and at the same time, be emotionally available. Make eye contact.
Let Scorpions know how fascinating they are. Really, no one compares.
Sagittarius in Love
You cherish your freedom, long for adventure, and take “Don’t fence me in” as
your personal creed. It goes without saying that relationships are an issue.
When a relationship challenges you or introduces you to a wider world, you’re
intrigued and excited. Unpredictability attracts you. But too many rules, too
many formal dinners, and too much domesticity drive you to despair.
 Sagittarius + Sagittarius: Like two Don Quixotes, you understand each
other well. Eternally young at heart, you share adventures, aspirations,
and the ability to amuse each other. But you tend to dream the impossi-
ble dream and may fail to address concrete issues when they arise. Make
frequent reality checks.
 Sagittarius + Capricorn: Capricorn is charmed by the Archer’s madcap
ways, while jaunty Sagittarius is amazed at how organized and grown-up
the Goat is. Like two neighboring countries, you can either go to war or
226
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

establish a cultural exchange. It helps if one of you has a planet or two in
the other’s sign. Example: John F. Kennedy, Jr. (Sagittarius) and Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy (Capricorn).
 Sagittarius + Aquarius: You’re both lively, broad-minded, and unregi-
mented. But neither of you has much talent for domesticity — or togeth-
erness. Prepare for a life of takeout dinners, offbeat friends, late-night
videos, and all-night chatter.
 Sagittarius + Pisces: You are two seekers, each with an inclination to
dream. But Sagittarius deflates the fragile Piscean ego, while sensitive
Pisces, though bewitching, can become strangely passive, which fiery
Sagittarius can’t abide. A questionable couple at best.
To snag a Sagittarius, don’t come on too strong. Clichéd courting gestures
make the Archer squirm. Instead, be casual, witty, lighthearted, and sponta-
neous. Spur-of-the-moment outings work in your favor; laying down too many
rules works against you. Remember that Sagittarius wants to be a free spirit
and delights in the unexpected. So keep your passport up-to-date. Be willing
to be daring. And don’t rush Sagittarians: No matter what they say, most of
them are commitment-phobic. They need to relax into relationships.
Capricorn in Love
Conservative and classy, you want a traditional relationship with all the
trappings. You aren’t particularly interested in wild flings, which isn’t to
say that you’re uninterested in sex. On the contrary, as an earth sign, you’re
a highly hormonal, high-stamina lover. But random sex seems meaningless
to you. You’re a devoted spouse, an attentive parent, a true friend, a loyal
son or daughter — the whole shebang. You seek ever-after commitment and
nothing less.
 Capricorn + Capricorn: You’re both ambitious, committed, and lusty.
But you run the danger of leading a life so upright, work-oriented, and
tightly scheduled that you never have any fun apart from sex. (Even
there, you aren’t the most creative lovers on the planet.) And if either
one of you gets depressed, you’re in trouble. 
 Capricorn + Aquarius: Capricorn is a traditionalist who believes in sys-
tems; progressive Aquarius is a maverick who likes to overturn them.
Capricorn worries and feels despondent; Aquarius believes that the future
is bright. Chances are you irritate each other. This can be a disaster —
unless one of you has a planet or two in the other’s sign.
227
Chapter 15: The Sun Sign Combinations

 Capricorn + Pisces: Enterprising Capricorn knows how to handle the
workaday world but can get bogged down in it; compassionate Pisces,
who has other values, specializes in escaping from (or ignoring) the
requirements of reality. But Pisces can lift Capricorn’s spirits, and
Capricorn can help Pisces get a toe or two on the ground. You inspire
and support each other.
Fixated on a Capricorn? Cool and contained, Capricorn follows the rules. You
should, too. Dress with class, be polite, be successful, be admiring. Offer up
respectable, high-class activities — theatre, art exhibits, lectures. Don’t jump
into bed right away. Don’t be aggressive. Don’t be vulgar. Don’t nag. Let
things unfold naturally. And be patient: Capricorn represses emotions and
generally takes things slowly. But Capricorn plays for keeps.
Aquarius in Love
A friendly, unconventional sort who’s intrigued by everyone, you connect
easily but superficially, and you value your freedom. Despite your reputation
for bohemian behavior, when you find someone you respect, you willingly
make the commitment — which doesn’t mean that you intend to give up your
independence or your eccentric ways. (Those are forever.) You can be as pas-
sionate as anyone else (and kinkier than most), but much as you enjoy it, you
aren’t a slave to sex. You live in your head.
 Aquarius + Aquarius: Ah, the people you meet, the causes you support,
and the parties you throw. Not to mention the way you decorate your
house. You’re unfettered, unorthodox, opinionated, and visionary — a
couple unlike any other. Mentally, you connect. Romantically, it’s another
story. But maybe that doesn’t matter. Like other air sign combinations,
you can easily be swept away on a sea of conversation.
 Aquarius + Pisces: This match is initially enticing but disappointing in
the long run — gentle Pisces is way too sensitive to be with someone as
detached and cerebral as the Water Bearer. But don’t tell that to Paul
Newman and Joanne Woodward. He has the Sun in Aquarius and the
Moon in Pisces. She has the Sun in Pisces and the Moon in Aquarius. We
should all be so lucky.
If you’re beguiled by an Aquarius, prepare to meet more eccentrics than you
thought existed outside of the Land of Oz. Aquarius collects them. Your mis-
sion is to strike the Water Bearer as irreplaceable and fascinating enough to
add to the collection. There’s no need to present yourself falsely or to iron
out the kinks. On the contrary. Be independent (but available). Express your
opinions. And be yourself — the more unorthodox, the better. A dozen roses?
No, no, no. An invitation to a midnight ramble through the meat-packing dis-
trict? That could work.
228
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

Pisces in Love
Gestures — the moonlit stroll, the mariachi singers — mean the world to you.
You’re a romantic who wants a cosmically connected, karmically generated,
some-enchanted-evening union with a soul mate. Though your intuition is
pinpoint accurate at other times, when you’re in love you can be amazingly
gullible, stunningly dependent, and more demanding than you may realize.
Ruled by your emotions, you’re also generous, erotic, affectionate, support-
ive, and kind.
 Pisces + Pisces: Same-sign unions are a mixed blessing because they
magnify both the strengths and the weaknesses of the sign. Two dreamy
Pisceans can communicate in ways that other signs can’t even imagine.
But practicality eludes you. Does that matter? Ultimately, it probably
does. Example: George Harrison and Patti Boyd. (When their marriage
crumbled, she wed his Aries friend, Eric Clapton.)
If you fall for a Pisces, be romantic. Pisces wants to be swept away, but not 
á la Tarzan and Jane. Being too aggressive may work short term (Pisces can
be passive), but over the long run, it won’t sit well. Pisces wants love to mean
a coming together of twin souls, two companions against the slings and
arrows of everyday life. Pisces also wants sentimental gifts, candlelit dinners,
Valentine’s remembrances, the whole bit. What Pisces doesn’t want is advice.
No matter how you phrase it, Pisces hears it as criticism, so lay off.
Finding Other Planetary Ties
What if your sign and your beloved’s aren’t compatible? Should your next
stop be Match.com? Not necessarily. Conjunctions or other close aspects
between the Moon in one chart and the Sun in another — or between the two
Moons — breed emotional understanding. Close aspects (up to and including
oppositions) that link Venus in one chart with Mars in another kindle sexual
attraction. Ascendants of agreeable signs make for personalities that mesh.
The more conjunctions, sextiles, and trines that you see between the planets
of one chart and the planets of another, the better. Squares and oppositions,
problematical though they can be, are still a tie, and they can provide the
right amount of friction.
The only planetary aspects that scarcely matter are conjunctions of Saturn
and Saturn, Uranus and Uranus, Neptune and Neptune, Pluto and Pluto.
These planets orbit the Sun so sluggishly that they define generations, not
individuals. The fact that your Neptune is conjunct your beloved’s doesn’t
mean that you’re karmically destined to be together. It means that you’re
about the same age — which isn’t much of a tie. But it isn’t nothing either, as
anyone who has ever attended a high school reunion can attest.

Incompatible? You be the judge
The actors and civil rights activists Ruby Dee
(Scorpio) and Ossie Davis (Sagittarius) were
born under neighboring — and hence incom-
patible — signs. Fortunately, her Ascendant and
Venus are in his Sun sign, Sagittarius; her Moon
conjuncts his Venus; and they both were born
with the Moon in Aquarius. Even though their
Sun signs aren’t an ideal pairing, the marriage,
which was also a working partnership, lasted 57
years — until his death.
Or consider Gertrude Stein, the avant-garde
Aquarian writer, and her companion, Alice B.
Toklas, a Taurus. They met in 1907 in Paris, where
Gertrude entertained everyone from Picasso to
Hemingway in her famous salon, and they stayed
together until Gertrude’s death in 1946. Although
the earthy Bull and the airy Water Bearer don’t
usually mix, the connection between them was
immediate. As Gertrude wrote when she
described their meeting in The Autobiography of
Alice B. Toklas (which she composed in Alice’s
voice, as if Alice herself had penned it), “I have
met several great people but I have only known
three first class geniuses and in each case on
sight within me something rang.”
I know what that something was. It was Alice’s
Mars, closely conjunct Gertrude’s Venus and
exactly opposite her Uranus. In the dominion of
the heart, that bolt-from-the-blue connection —
along with a series of harmonious trines linking
the two charts — quickly prevailed over the
warring Sun signs.
The other two geniuses that Alice met, by the
way, were Pablo Picasso and the philosopher
Alfred North Whitehead. Personally, I never
doubted that Alice might have responded to
Picasso, who clearly had a way with women.
But Alfred North Whitehead? I wasn’t so sure.
So I tracked down his birthday, and guess
what? Whitehead’s Venus in Aquarius was con-
junct Alice’s Mars, and his Pluto in Taurus was
exactly conjunct her Venus. I’m certain that
when they met something within her rang.

The Times of Our Lives: Transits
In This Chapter
 Discovering the transits
 Tracking the cycles of the planets
 Staying calm in the presence of a worrisome transit
O
nce upon a time, astrology was the province of the privileged. Kings and
pharaohs consulted astrologers, not because they were fascinated by
the intricacies of personality but because they wanted to know when to wage
war, when to stockpile grain, when to build a temple, and when to marry.
They wanted to know, in short, how to lead their lives. Astrology provided
some answers.
Today, anyone can take advantage of the wisdom astrology has to offer. You
can glean some of that wisdom from your birth chart — and some of it from
the current position of the planets. Transiting planets are the planets as they
appear in the sky now. As they wheel across the zodiac, they trigger your
birth planets, presenting you with challenges and opportunities. Transiting
Saturn is conjunct your Moon? Be prepared to combat depression. Uranus is
crossing your Midheaven? Get ready for an upheaval in your career. Every
time a planet in the sky forms an aspect to a planet or an angle in your birth
chart, it stirs up a different area of your psyche.
Sad to say, this book isn’t long enough to consider every transit. I’m leaving
out the transits through the houses. I ignore transiting squares (they’re
stressful) as well as sextiles and trines (they’re helpful). And I entirely omit
aspects made by transiting Venus, Mercury, and the Sun because they move
so fast that their influence is fleeting. (The Moon whizzes through the signs at
an even faster clip. But it’s so close that it exerts an influence anyway, which
is why I devote Chapter 17 to lunar transits.)
In this chapter, I focus on the slower-moving planets, beginning with Mars and
ending with Pluto. I consider the conjunctions and oppositions that those
planets make to your natal chart. And I try, as best I can, to highlight the pos-
sibilities that they open up for you. Transits don’t change your natal chart.
Like it or not, your birth chart is eternal. But they can help you achieve the
potential contained within your horoscope. And that, as they say, is priceless.

Investigating Transits
To identify the transits in effect now, turn to the Appendix at the back of this
book and look up the current position of the planets. The planetary tables in
the Appendix tell you what sign each planet is in. Jot down the positions of
the planets from Mars to Pluto. Then make a copy of your birth chart and
position the transiting planets around it. As models, look at Figures 16-2 and
16-3, which present Anne Morrow Lindbergh’s chart. In each case, the inner
wheel represents the birth chart, and the outer wheel shows the location of
the transiting planets.
To know exactly where the transiting planets are and whether they’re within
a degree or two of your birth planets, you need to consult a professional,
wander about on the Web, or — better yet — buy an astrological calendar,
which can tell you the precise position of the planets at a glance. The best
ones are Llewellyn’s Daily Planetary Guide and Jim Maynard’s Celestial Guide
and Celestial Influences calendars.
Showing the importance of transits
Anne Morrow Lindbergh was the author of 14 books, the mother of six chil-
dren, and the wife of the aviator Charles Lindbergh, who flew across the
Atlantic Ocean by himself in 1927 and became an instant international hero
(though his reputation was sullied later on when he accepted an award from
the Nazi government). Unlike many wives of famous men, she became famous
in her own right — which is exactly what you would expect from someone
with a tenth house as packed as hers. Figure 16-1 shows her extraordinary
birth chart.
After Lindbergh’s triumphant solo flight, he became a goodwill ambassador
to Latin America. In December 1927, he visited Mexico, where he met Anne,
whose father was the American ambassador. A year and a half later, they mar-
ried. Figure 16-2 shows Anne’s chart in the center surrounded by the transits
for her initial meeting with Charles. Notice that Jupiter, the bringer of oppor-
tunity, and Uranus, the lord of the unexpected, are conjunct in her seventh
house of marriage. Any astrologer could have told her that she would meet
someone soon and that he would be an unusual person.
The inner chart is the birth chart. The planets in the outer circle represent
the transits.

Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

When they married, Uranus was still in her seventh house. Almost three
years later, tragedy struck when the Lindberghs’ 20-month-old baby was kid-
napped and killed. The murderer’s trial, known as “the trial of the century,”
was arguably bigger than O.J. Simpson’s. Her transits at the time of the kid-
napping are shown in Figure 16-3.
Notice that Saturn, the planet of restriction, is now in her fifth house of chil-
dren, and Uranus, the planet of the unexpected, is in her eighth house of
death and transformation. Those two transits, I should point out, aren’t
nearly enough to trigger such an exceedingly rare and terrible loss. After all,
everyone who had an Ascendant in the neighborhood of 21° Virgo also expe-
rienced those transits. A birth chart must show the potential for an event in
order for it to happen. And there it is: The close opposition of her natal
Uranus to her natal Sun, Moon, Mars, and Neptune clearly introduces the
possibility of violence. The transits acted on the possibilities already there in
her remarkable chart.

planets around the outer rim. You’ll see right away that there’s a lot going on.
Mars is here, Saturn is there, Pluto and Jupiter are together in a third place. So
how can you tell which transits to concentrate on?
Here’s the rule: The transits that pack the biggest wallop are those made by
the slowest planets — Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto — to the Sun, the
Moon, the Ascendant, and the faster planets. Contacts made by the faster
planets are usually short-lived. Contacts made by the slower planets to the
slower planets (such as Uranus opposite your Pluto or Neptune conjunct
your Saturn) may be too subtle to detect (unless the natal planet happens to
occupy a prominent position in your chart). But contacts made by a slow
planet to one of your personal planets — Pluto conjunct your Moon, Uranus
opposite your Sun, and so on — signify the chapters of your life.
Tracking Mars
Mars is associated with vitality, initiative, passion, force, anger, and aggression.
Mars stirs your desires and prods you to take action. As a rule, Mars spends
about two months in a sign, taking about two years to travel through the
zodiac and return to the position that it occupied at your birth. But those fig-
ures are only averages because, like the other planets, Mars sometimes slows
down, turns retrograde, and spends several months in one sign (see Chapter 18
for more on retrograde planets). To show you how varied its schedule can be,
in 1997, Mars sped through Scorpio in about six weeks. But when it returned to
that sign in 1999, it lingered there for over five months. Naturally, the more time
it spends in a sign, the more it energizes the planets it contacts there.
The major transits of Mars are as follows:
 Mars conjunct the Sun: You feel determined, aggressive, and brave. But
act quickly (and try to avoid angry outbursts). This energetic transit
usually lasts only a few days, although occasionally, when Mars goes ret-
rograde, it can carry a longer, hardier charge.
 Mars opposite the Sun: You’re energetic but embattled. This is a don’t-
mess-with-me transit.
 Mars conjunct the Moon: You’re feisty, expressive, and in no mood to
repress your powerful emotions or peevish irritations, which somehow
just pop out. Just remember that a little self-awareness goes a long way.
 Mars opposite the Moon: Take care. Your emotional outpourings —
which feel externally caused — can quickly escalate into confrontation.
Count to ten.
 Mars conjunct Mercury: You feel impatient, excited, and filled with
ideas. You express your opinions with confidence — and aggression. A
hint of competition or hostility may sneak into your communications.
235
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

 Mars opposite Mercury: You argue, you debate, you take no prisoners.
You’re quick to respond, but you may also feel frustrated, beleaguered,
confrontational, and hostile. Be careful of what you say.
 Mars conjunct Venus: Your sex drive, ability to love, and artistic
impulses are working overtime. You’re at your most irresistible.
 Mars opposite Venus: Socially and sexually, you’re in the mood for
love. But your strategies for getting together with other people may
be less than successful. You run the risk of being too assertive or
uncooperative — or of attracting people who are behaving in a similarly
out-of-balance fashion.
 Mars conjunct natal Mars: Mars returns. The hero’s journey begins
anew as a fresh wave of energy and desire washes over you. Your chal-
lenge is to harness that energy. This transit, which occurs every two
years, marks the end of one energy cycle and the beginning of another.
This is the moment to pursue a new interest, invent a project, and stay
open to possibilities that arrive unbidden. Transiting Mars can also gen-
erate hostility, so watch your temper.
 Mars opposite natal Mars: Though your stamina is high, you may not find
it easy to use your energy in a constructive, consistent manner. Something
you’ve been involved in for about a year has reached a critical point.
Much effort is required, and your temper could flare out of control.
 Mars conjunct Jupiter: The universe supports your grandest visions by
prodding you to get off the couch and do something to actualize them.
You’re motivated to take action. Under this encouraging, expansive tran-
sit, you also benefit from travel and education.
 Mars opposite Jupiter: This can be a fortunate transit. You have plenty
of energy, and you’re buoyant and optimistic. But you run the risk of
promising too much, overestimating your capabilities, and overreacting.
 Mars conjunct Saturn: Because you have a strong sense of limitations
and bristle at the obstructions you face, this tends to be a challenging
transit. It can also be a time of great accomplishment, thanks to your
increased ability to get organized and to focus.
 Mars opposite Saturn: This transit calls for caution, diligence, and
responsible behavior. Alas, you’re likely to act rashly, resist the dictates
of others, and express your authority awkwardly. Plus you’re irritable
and you feel sorry for yourself.
 Mars conjunct Uranus: You act impulsively, rebelling against constraints
and sometimes taking off in unanticipated directions. During the few days
when Mars is conjunct your birth Uranus, buckle your seat belt and avoid
skateboarding. As usual with Uranus, the rule is simple: Expect the unex-
pected, and be safe.
 Mars opposite Uranus: Tension, strain, accidents, and unpredictable
events can interrupt your plans. Don’t take reckless chances during this
agitating transit. And be sure to back up your computer files.
236
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Mars conjunct Neptune: Your dream life picks up, and you seek inspira-
tion. Artistic, spiritual, or healing activities excite you. But be careful
about drugs and alcohol, and avoid making big decisions — your judg-
ment may be skewed.
 Mars opposite Neptune: Vivid dreams and artistic inspiration character-
ize this transit. But your efforts to get something done in the workaday
world could go awry. You may feel taken advantage of, confused, or out
of the loop.
 Mars conjunct Pluto: Your attempts to pursue your ambitions and
express your personal power in interactions with others receive a boost.
 Mars opposite Pluto: In your desire to establish yourself, you run the
risk of stumbling into power struggles.
 Mars conjunct the Ascendant: You express yourself effectively, as long
as you avoid sounding angry, and you’re motivated to take steps on your
own behalf. Following the conjunction to the Ascendant, Mars travels
through your first house, boosting your physical energy and lending you
a boldness that you may not normally feel.
 Mars opposite the Ascendant: You may feel angry or upset. After form-
ing the opposition to your Ascendant, Mars travels through your sev-
enth house for about two months, highlighting issues concerning
marriage or business partnerships and underscoring your unwillingness
to be passive. But arguments and tension upset you, and you may take
out your frustration on those to whom you feel the closest.
 Mars conjunct the Midheaven: This transit, along with the two-month-
long sojourn of Mars in your tenth house, motivates you to chase after
your professional desires. It also increases your impatience. Try not to
be belligerent.
 Mars opposite the Midheaven: Your professional efforts fizzle out or are
rebuffed, and your attention goes elsewhere. As Mars conjuncts your I.C.
(which is directly opposite your Midheaven) and travels through your
fourth house, it awakens your interest in home and family and energizes
your domestic life. Hidden conflicts emerge.
Mars transits are energizing. When Mars is traveling through a house, you
find the energy to take action in that area. You benefit from taking a coura-
geous approach.
Activating Jupiter
Jupiter spins through the zodiac in slightly fewer than 12 years, spending about
a year in each sign. Its transits are among the most eagerly anticipated — and
the most disappointing. As the planet of expansion, opportunity, generosity,
and prosperity, Jupiter can bring happiness, growth, and success. As the planet
237
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

of philosophy, religion, and education, it can stimulate an exploration of
belief and the pursuit of knowledge. But despite its reputation as the lord 
of abundance and the bringer of good fortune, Jupiter doesn’t necessarily
deliver the sweepstake’s prize patrol to your door, and people who sit around
passively waiting for their wishes to come true under its influence are bound
to be dissatisfied. The problem is that while genial Jupiter may lead you right
up to the doors of opportunity, it also prompts feelings of contentment and
self-indulgence. Instead of trying to push those doors open, many people lean
back to enjoy the transit and thereby miss it.
In my experience, a Jupiter transit is a trumpet call to arms. When you see
Jupiter poised on the brink of your Sun sign, about to contact your career-
oriented Midheaven, or entering your seventh house of marriage, you know
that opportunities are available in those arenas. But you have to do your
part. To get the most out of Jupiter, make a legitimate effort to learn some-
thing, to tackle an old dilemma in a novel way, or to find time for the things
you always say you want to do. When you take action under a Jupiter transit,
rewards inevitably follow.
A transit can only activate the potential that already exists in your chart.
 Jupiter conjunct the Sun: Seize the opportunity to branch out during
this year of growth, but be warned: If life is going well, you may be
tempted to do nothing. If life isn’t going your way, you may become dis-
heartened or cynical. Don’t let Jupiter lull you into complacency. This is
the time to reach out, be generous, and take risks.
 Jupiter opposite the Sun: Opportunities are available, but you run the
risk of overextending yourself, overdramatizing your situation, or simply
promising too much.
 Jupiter conjunct the Moon: This transit brings expanded sensitivity and
a greater flow of emotions — which is pleasant if your birth Moon makes
mostly harmonious aspects to other planets but exhausting if your
Moon is afflicted by squares and oppositions.
 Jupiter opposite the Moon: Why does every emotional blip — every
minor snub, every disappointment, and every little boost — feel utterly
seismic? The answer is that, thanks to Jupiter, you’re supersensitive,
with a tendency to inflate your feelings and overreact.
 Jupiter conjunct Mercury: Jupiter enlivens your intellect and expands
your ability to express yourself. You speak up freely and travel happily.
 Jupiter opposite Mercury: Seek knowledge. Read vociferously. Write
daily. And remember that overconfidence can be a problem. Don’t talk
too much, and postpone making important decisions.
 Jupiter conjunct Venus: Your social life blossoms. You express your
affections easily, attract love, and enjoy the arts. This fortunate transit
even improves your earning ability.
238
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Jupiter opposite Venus: You’re attractive to others, and your social life
is active but not necessarily satisfying. Perhaps you’re trying too hard.
You may also be spending too much.
 Jupiter conjunct Mars: You’re courageous, passionate, busy, and filled
with vitality. Being assertive produces excellent results.
 Jupiter opposite Mars: You feel energetic but frustrated, and you may
find it difficult to repress your hostility. Demands are numerous, and dis-
agreements may arise.
 Jupiter conjunct natal Jupiter: Jupiter circles back to its birth position
every 12 years, renewing your optimism. This can be a lucky, adventur-
ous time during which travel, education, and philosophical explorations
bring fulfillment. Your efforts to brush past old boundaries pay off, and
you have some fun along the way. But beware: Jupiter can also promote
self-satisfaction, laziness, and smug indifference.
 Jupiter opposite natal Jupiter: You’re in a generous, exuberant mood,
but you may be merrier than the situation merits. Watch out for
overindulgence.
 Jupiter conjunct Saturn: You may become supremely conscious of your
fears and limitations, but they have less of a charge. You find the help
you need, or you figure out a way to get organized, or you finally buckle
down and do something about your problems.
 Jupiter opposite Saturn: As much as you want to break out of your old
patterns, circumstances may not permit it. However tempted you may
be by new acquaintances and fresh opportunities, your responsibilities
are ongoing. Your best move is to accept your obligations.
 Jupiter conjunct Uranus: Unusual opportunities present themselves to
you, and you have the courage to take a leap and express your individu-
ality. This is an exciting time of positive change.
 Jupiter opposite Uranus: Surprising opportunities may bring a 
longed-for chance to break away from confining circumstances.
Overconfidence leads nowhere, but there’s something to be said for
taking a calculated risk.
 Jupiter conjunct Neptune: Your mystical side, spiritual interests, super-
natural ability, and imagination are enlarged. Possible problems include
excessive daydreaming, substance abuse, and the refusal to accept reality.
 Jupiter opposite Neptune: Accepting reality isn’t easy — and you proba-
bly aren’t even trying. Your imagination may be soaring, but your judg-
ment is poor. You’re impractical and easily deceived. If you’ve ever
struggled with substance abuse, you must be vigilant now.
 Jupiter conjunct Pluto: Your ambition and personal power are enlarged,
and your labors bear fruit. In the past, you may have journeyed through
the underworld of sorrow, fear, or isolation. If so, you now return to the
light.
239
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

 Jupiter opposite Pluto: Your desire for power can get out of hand, and
obstacles may block your way. At this moment of transition, you may
feel as if you have little control or that you’re caught in a power struggle.
 Jupiter conjunct the Ascendant: You’re open, ebullient, and even lucky.
During the year or so when Jupiter contacts your Ascendant and travels
through your first house, you’re outgoing and receptive, and people
respond to you positively. The bad news: Weight gain is a distinct
possibility.
 Jupiter opposite the Ascendant: You easily connect with others, and
your relationships flourish. During the year or so when Jupiter opposes
the Ascendant and inhabits the seventh house, you could attract a new
partner, either business or personal, into your life.
 Jupiter conjunct the Midheaven: Jupiter’s conjunction with the
Midheaven, followed by a yearlong sojourn in your tenth house, can
bring success, an enlarged role in the world, and career options galore.
Take advantage of them.
 Jupiter opposite the Midheaven: Family relationships improve. This is a
fine year to move, invest in real estate, focus on domestic pursuits, and
heal family wounds.
Jupiter transits bring growth, opportunity, and the danger of indolence.
Coping with Saturn
People who know something about astrology tend to look forward to
Jupiter’s transits — and view Saturn’s transits with alarm. Saturn takes
almost 30 years to whirl through the zodiac. It spends about two and a half
years in each sign, and it’s associated with duty, discipline, effort, obstruc-
tions, limitations, boundaries, and lessons learned. Gloomy Saturn can bring
despair, apathy, and a dangerous case of the blues. But just as Jupiter doesn’t
necessarily deliver matchless love, best-selling first novels, or winning lottery
tickets, Saturn doesn’t necessarily beget misery. It can bring responsibility in
the form of a better job, limitation in the form of a committed relationship,
and the enhanced self-esteem that accompanies self-discipline. To benefit
from a Saturn transit, you need to create structure, get organized, and figure
out how to manage your time.
Transits, by definition, are transitory. They don’t last long, so you must act
promptly to take advantage of them.
 Saturn conjunct the Sun: You reap what you sow: That’s the message of
this challenging and sometimes discouraging transit. Saturn stimulates
your ambitions, increases your need for security, forces you to learn dis-
cipline, and may confront you with your weaknesses. But it can also
bring security, fulfillment, and recognition for work well done.
240
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Saturn opposite the Sun: Pessimism and low vitality characterize this
difficult transit, which takes place approximately 14 years after Saturn
conjuncts the Sun. Other people may oppose your efforts. Be patient.
Note: The squares of Saturn to the Sun, which occur seven years before
and after the opposition, are also trying.
 Saturn conjunct the Moon: Worries afflict you. You may feel melancholy,
misunderstood, unloved, or unlucky — not to mention filled with self-
doubt. You’re imprisoned momentarily in the abyss, where the time is
always right for confiding in a journal, talking to a therapist, and remind-
ing yourself that this too shall pass.
 Saturn opposite the Moon: Insecurity, bitterness, and stressful relation-
ships may cause you to withdraw during this isolating time. Though you
may wish for sympathy from others, you aren’t likely to get it. Avoid self-
pity and take practical steps.
 Saturn conjunct Mercury: You’re in a thoughtful and possibly pes-
simistic mood that favors study, concentration, and regular schedules.
This is the ideal time to read War and Peace, Moby Dick, or any other
massive classics you’ve been avoiding.
 Saturn opposite Mercury: Circumstances may cause you to question
your ideas or to look for a more effective communication style.
 Saturn conjunct Venus: Weak relationships may crumble. You may feel
lonely, inhibited, unloved, and underfunded. And yet a new, more seri-
ous relationship can begin, possibly with an older person. This is also a
fine time to launch an artistic project.
 Saturn opposite Venus: Breaking up is hard to do, even if it’s the only
move to make. Healthy relationships survive this stressful transit. But
even then the blinders come off as you face the truth.
 Saturn conjunct Mars: Your efforts are frustrated, provoking you to feel
resentful and overburdened. If anger is an issue for you, learn to manage
it now. This is also an excellent time to hire a trainer or to join a gym.
You’re being challenged to learn control. If you act methodically, you can
accomplish a lot.
 Saturn opposite Mars: This transit can be rough, especially if you’re the
sort of person who collects enemies. Obstacles impede your progress as
Saturn forces you to accept reality, take appropriate action, and — worst
of all — be patient.
 Saturn conjunct Jupiter: Even though the opportunities that arise during
this tedious time may not be flashy, they’re nonetheless real. During a
Saturn transit, facing reality is essential. Although you may need to
streamline or limit your goals in some way, Saturn rewards your efforts.
 Saturn opposite Jupiter: Luck isn’t with you, though it isn’t against you,
either. Instead, this is a time of restricted growth, dampened enthusi-
asm, industriousness, and acceptance of the status quo.
241
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

 Saturn conjunct Saturn: Saturn returns. This is a pivotal moment, a time
to face reality. Saturn returns to the position it occupied in your birth
chart when you’re between the ages of 28 to 30, 58 to 60, and 88 to 90.
The first Saturn return represents the true onset of adulthood. During
this typically trying time, you’re forced to face the truth about yourself,
stop messing around, and grow up. The second and third returns repre-
sent further turning points, during which you must admit to your dissat-
isfactions and prepare for a new phase in your life. In each case, Saturn
encourages you to confront your fears, acknowledge the obstacles in
your path, name your ambitions, and change your habits.
 Saturn opposite Saturn: This transit, which forces you to see yourself in
relationship to the larger world, can be upsetting, especially the first
time around, when you’re about 14 years old. Subsequent experiences
occur roughly at ages 44 and 74. In each instance, you may feel lonely
and insecure. What helps? Focusing on specific tasks and practical
efforts can increase your sense of security. The message: persevere.
 Saturn conjunct Uranus: Though you may feel constrained, it’s pointless
to rebel. Instead, seek controlled ways of expressing your individuality,
which will allow you to sail through this transit with aplomb.
 Saturn opposite Uranus: Born free? That’s not the way it feels. Events
conspire to make you feel as if your options are limited, but don’t under-
estimate the positive power of Saturn. Saturn supports organization and
self-discipline. It rewards you by allowing you to develop the most idio-
syncratic and original aspects of your self.
 Saturn conjunct Neptune: You may feel steadier and more in control
during this introspective phase — or you may be pessimistic and cre-
atively stymied. If you’ve been troubled by alcohol or drug abuse, you’ll
likely be forced to come to terms with it.
 Saturn opposite Neptune: You may feel beset by confusion, uncertainty,
and despondency. Dreams can come true, yet you feel disappointed.
This transit presents yet another chance to accept reality (sigh) and
grow up.
 Saturn conjunct Pluto: Issues of control and manipulation arise during
this long-term, transformative transit. Despite restrictive and frustrating
circumstances, you can find a way to acknowledge your mistakes (or
obsessions) and rethink your purpose. As always with Saturn, reaching
these goals requires you to acknowledge the realities of your situation.
 Saturn opposite Pluto: Your desire to control your circumstances and
pursue your goals collides with external pressures, which may be more
powerful than you are. An obsession that may have you in its grip needs
to be broken, and yet you may feel incapable of doing so. Look to areas
of your life that are going well and focus on those.
242
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Saturn conjunct the Ascendant: You strike people as dependable and
trustworthy, and greater responsibility may come to you as a result.
Though you may feel restrained and overworked during this difficult
time, this transit brings some benefits. It improves your ability to con-
centrate, stimulates you to regulate your behavior (making this the ideal
time to start a sensible diet), and encourages you to rethink your ambi-
tions. At the same time, you’re beginning a seven-year stretch known as
the obscurity cycle, which is characterized by introspection and a search
for personal growth.
 Saturn opposite the Ascendant: This transit marks a turning point in the
way you relate to the world. It may bring dissatisfactions to the surface
and disrupt relationships, both personal and professional. Established
relationships (if they aren’t solid) may break up. New alliances are likely
to be with people who are older or more authoritative. Though relation-
ships are likely to be a challenge during the next two and a half years,
the good news is that you’re beginning a seven-year period of opportu-
nity and accomplishment known as the activity cycle. For 14 years, your
focus has been primarily internal; now you’re opening up to the world.
 Saturn conjunct the Midheaven: With this transit, the seven-year influ-
ence cycle begins. If you’ve been paying your dues, you can expect to
reach a peak of recognition and responsibility. This is a time of success
and prominence during which you establish your place in the world. But
if you’ve been slacking off, this transit could herald a wave of failure and
defeat. If that’s your situation, remember that Saturn always responds
positively to increased structure.
 Saturn opposite the Midheaven: Issues regarding home and family beg
for attention. Though you may feel weighed down by family needs and
the burden of the past, you should know that you’re beginning another
component of the Saturn cycle. Having just completed the seven-year
obscurity cycle, which is described earlier in this section, you’re now
entering the emergence cycle, a more creative and exciting time. A move
is also a possibility.
As the planet of limitation and loss, Saturn requires a clear-eyed assessment
of your situation. It also brings responsibility and rewards hard work.
Unpredictable Uranus
When Uranus rides into town, life gets interesting. As the planet of revolution,
invention, electricity, individuality, and eccentricity, Uranus disrupts the
usual flow of events and is associated with unforeseen occurrences and
243
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

unusual people. Uranus takes 84 years — about a lifetime — to traverse the
zodiac. (Turn to Chapter 10 for more information about the outer planets.)
 Uranus conjunct the Sun: You’re in a holding pattern, but you aren’t
going to be there long. Your need to express your individuality propels
you toward once-in-a-lifetime change. If you’re on track, this transit
shouldn’t be traumatic. But if you’re drifting, stuck, or otherwise off
your path, this transit augurs disruptive change — one way or another. If
you don’t initiate alterations on your own, you can expect it to arrive
unbidden from external sources. Act now.
 Uranus opposite the Sun: This disruptive transit supports innovative
thinking and ushers in a creative, explosive era of change and instability.
Digging in your heels against it won’t work. Flexibility is required.
 Uranus conjunct the Moon: Intuitive flashes bring insight during this
moody, unstable transit. Look for emotional storms, shifts in family
dynamics, or a sudden urge for independence.
 Uranus opposite the Moon: Feelings of restriction and a need to break
from the past make this a time of emotional fluctuations and revolution-
ary changes.
 Uranus conjunct Mercury: Though you may feel overscheduled and
frantic, rigid thinking holds you back. Fresh insights and facts compel
you to abolish tired ideas and patterns of communication. Uranus trig-
gers your ability to think in an original way. Carry a notebook.
 Uranus opposite Mercury: You’re mentally active and physically ner-
vous, and you may have trouble sleeping. Tackling your problems in the
same old way leads to the same old result. Willingly or not, you must try
a new approach.
 Uranus conjunct Venus: If the sizzle has gone out of a relationship you
value, you can no longer be passive about it. Reinvigorate it or look else-
where. If you’re alone, you could meet someone new in an unexpected
way, and that person won’t be like anyone else you know. Relationships
that carry a hint of unpredictability appeal to you. Boring old alliances,
no matter how worthy or rooted in history, don’t.
 Uranus opposite Venus: In your desire to escape boredom, you — or
your partner — may be tempted by a relationship that seems to offer
greater pizazz. But will this new union last? I wouldn’t bet on it.
 Uranus conjunct Mars: You’re restless, anxious for change, and ready to
take the initiative: that’s the positive part. You’re also angrier than usual
and likely to act rashly and make impulsive decisions. Plus, you’re
accident-prone.
 Uranus opposite Mars: Something needs to change during this volatile
period, but your actions may be erratic because you aren’t sure what
you want. Controlling your animosity and competitive feelings can be
tricky, and you may provoke the opposition of others. Yet those outer
influences may provide just the kick you need.
244
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Uranus conjunct Jupiter: Rare opportunities and startling changes in
circumstances mark this conjunction. In one chart from my files, this
transit coincided with the loss of a family member and an unplanned
pregnancy. In another case, it brought a disruptive but positive cross-
country move. In a third instance, a woman rocketed to professional
prominence when Uranus conjoined her tenth-house Jupiter — and
plunged to Earth a year later when Saturn contacted her Sun and she
received the dreaded pink slip.
 Uranus opposite Jupiter: A need for independence and an urge to take a
risk characterize this unruly influence. Fresh possibilities may tantalize
(or frustrate) you. In your desire to lead a bigger life, you make some
astonishing choices. Surprise your friends by all means — but don’t let
your optimism (or grandiosity) run away with your common sense.
 Uranus conjunct Saturn: You feel boxed in and tense and no longer able
to tolerate the constraints you put on yourself. Uranus acts as a catalyst,
forcing you to shed old fears, limitations, and even jobs in search of a
less confining sense of self.
 Uranus opposite Saturn: You feel uneasy and anxious. Old habits die,
and outworn patterns crumble under the onslaught of forces beyond
your control.
 Uranus conjunct natal Uranus: The Uranus return occurs when you’re
84 years old. It symbolizes a complete cycle of individuality and can
stimulate you to seek a new expression of your most essential self.
 Uranus opposite natal Uranus: This unsettling, anxiety-provoking,
midlife-crisis transit, which happens around age 42, encourages you to
take risks and boosts your desire to rebel against the status quo.
 Uranus conjunct Neptune: If you were born in the early 1990s, you may
have undergone this perplexing, sensitizing transit as a child. (Episodes
of psychic awareness may be traced to this influence.) However, if
you’re old enough to remember 1993 (Hint: President Bill Clinton was
inaugurated), you won’t experience this transit in your lifetime.
 Uranus opposite Neptune: If you’re feeling the effects of this transit,
you’re probably in your 70s. The advantage of aging, aside from getting
into the movies at a discount, is that you worry less about what other
people think and more about what matters to you. Amazing dreams,
modern music, and nontraditional spiritual pursuits have a surprising
appeal. Avoid get-rich-quick schemes.
 Uranus conjunct Pluto: This heavy-duty transit can bring transitions
that are unforeseen and momentous. However, unless you’re over 100
years old, you aren’t going to experience it.
 Uranus opposite Pluto: Old patterns and obsessions fall by the wayside
with this transit, especially if Pluto is prominent in your horoscope.
245
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

 Uranus conjunct the Ascendant: Altering your appearance, acting in an
abrupt or unpredictable manner, and emphasizing your greatest eccen-
tricities are methods of expressing your insistent need for personal free-
dom. This transit can also coincide with unexpected recognition.
 Uranus opposite the Ascendant: Whether you initiate these changes or
someone else does, unexpected shake-ups in relationships clear the way
for greater freedom and individuality. The people who attract you now
are markedly different from your usual type.
 Uranus conjunct the Midheaven: Career upheavals can open a dramatic
chapter in your life if you have the courage to respond. When an unusual
opportunity presents itself, grab it. Don’t let unresolved feelings of inferi-
ority keep you from fulfilling your destiny.
 Uranus opposite the Midheaven: Unexpected events and challenges can
turn your domestic life upside down and alter your social status or pro-
fessional relationships. A sudden move isn’t impossible.
Uranus, the planet of upheaval, brings unexpected changes and can be asso-
ciated with chaos and disorientation, as well as liberation.
Nebulous Neptune
Magical, mysterious Neptune is befuddling and inspiring. It dissolves bound-
aries, spawns illusions, encourages compassion, and stimulates the imagina-
tion. Unlike Uranus, Neptune’s influence can be difficult to detect, because it
comes wrapped in a haze of confusion. When something’s happening but you
don’t know what it is, look to Neptune, which takes about 164 years to travel
through the zodiac. The Appendix presents its itinerary.
 Neptune conjunct the Sun: Self-pity, moodiness, and a diminished sense
of self-esteem are the downsides of this lengthy transit. It can also fortify
your idealism, compassion, vision, and psychic sensitivity.
 Neptune opposite the Sun: Your ability to deceive yourself (or to allow
yourself to be deceived) is at a peak during this vaguely mystifying tran-
sit. Though your confidence may waver, sometimes wandering in the
wilderness is all you can do. You’re looking for a more compassionate
sense of self.
 Neptune conjunct the Moon: You’re empathetic, forgiving, and highly
attuned to the emotional environment around you, be it positive or
negative. To defend yourself against illusion, set limits and pay close
attention to your intuition.
246
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Neptune opposite the Moon: Emotional uncertainty, the urge to escape,
and unfamiliar obsessions may afflict you. You’re easily deluded, so
be cautious about falling in love or devoting yourself to a spiritual
advisor with an answer for everything. Don’t let others erode your
trust in yourself.
 Neptune conjunct Mercury: If you’re a poet, artist, or musician, you’re
going to love this transit. But be prepared: The imaginative boost occurs
at the expense of the ordinary things you count on Mercury for — like
making intelligent decisions or remembering to pay your bills.
 Neptune opposite Mercury: Think you’re communicating clearly? Think
you’ve come up with a foolproof plan to eradicate war, hunger, or terror-
ism? Think again. Neptune stimulates your artistic impulses, but it also
foments an atmosphere in which misguided thinking can thrive.
 Neptune conjunct Venus: You’re acutely sensitive and primed to fall in
love. But does the object of your devotion return your affection? Is the
relationship as perfect as you imagine? Remember, please, that Neptune
is the planet of delusion. Similarly, if you tumble into the trap of self-pity
and become convinced that you’ll always be alone, dismiss that feeling
and put your trust in art, music, poetry, and the universe.
 Neptune opposite Venus: You feel riled up, especially (but not solely)
about your love life. Romantic visions dance in your head, yet you’re
unwilling or unable to fulfill those dreams. This transit, like the conjunc-
tion of Neptune and Venus, stimulates wishful thinking in a big way.
 Neptune conjunct Mars: If you’re angry or envious, or you’re wasting
your abilities, you dissipate your energy. By acting intuitively and mar-
shalling your talents, you lay the groundwork for success. Pay attention
to coincidence and luck, whether good or bad. The outer world mirrors
your inner reality and tells you whether you’re on the right path.
 Neptune opposite Mars: Confused about what you want? Observe your-
self as your suppressed desires rise into awareness and express them-
selves in your actions. And watch, too, when you respond negatively to
other people. Those reactions reflect your shadow, the dark side of your
personality.
 Neptune conjunct Jupiter: You fantasize about a multitude of possibili-
ties. And so, without even realizing it, you open yourself up to new expe-
riences. Your idealism, compassion, and faith in life grow.
 Neptune opposite Jupiter: You’re sympathetic, idealistic, and open to
experience — but you’re out of touch with reality. Don’t buy that bridge.
 Neptune conjunct Saturn: The rigid rules and regulations you live by
aren’t working anymore, and you need to update them with a more
inspired, less fearful set of bylaws. Remind yourself that everyone who
was born within a few months of you is experiencing this transit. And be
sensible about money.
247
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

 Neptune opposite Saturn: Old fears and blockages appear, and you have
to face them squarely. This is a challenging but not necessarily negative
time, for Neptune can dispel the limitations of the past.
 Neptune conjunct Uranus: In the 21st century, this generational transit
affects only the elderly. It’s likely to produce altered states of conscious-
ness, a vision of freedom, and an outbreak of eccentricity.
 Neptune opposite Uranus: Vague dissatisfaction of the midlife-crisis kind
afflicts you. If you’ve been in a rut, even if it’s one you dug yourself, you
may try to redefine yourself through exciting experiences.
 Neptune conjunct natal Neptune: If you’re experiencing this transit,
you’re too young (still an infant) or too ancient (164) to worry about it.
 Neptune opposite natal Neptune: This transit happens at age 82, about
two years before Uranus returns. It can coincide with increased confusion,
but it can also strengthen your imagination and spiritual awareness.
 Neptune conjunct Pluto: This conjunction isn’t going to happen in your
lifetime.
 Neptune opposite Pluto: This transit exerts a subtle influence that
increases awareness and encourages you to rethink various aspects of
your life, including psychological issues you’ve tried to repress.
 Neptune conjunct the Ascendant: Neptune dissolves the boundaries of
the external personality, leaving you unfocused or lost in a reverie.
Consciously or not, you may alter your image. At worst, you’re self-
destructive. At best, you’re intuitive and creative. Art, music, film, dream
analysis, and spiritual exploration are healthy outlets. And there’s noth-
ing wrong with daydreaming.
 Neptune opposite the Ascendant: If you’re in a satisfying relationship,
the two of you develop a form of communication that’s virtually clair-
voyant. But if your relationship is shaky, secrecy and deception can
bring the house down. Pay attention to nuance.
 Neptune conjunct the Midheaven: The boundaries of your career are
dissolving. Mysterious goings-on in the office may worry you and cause
you to consider other career options. Satisfaction may come through
spiritual matters, film, photography, music, art, oceanography, and any-
thing that involves the healing professions. But beware, for you may also
be subject to delusion, as often occurs with Neptune.
 Neptune opposite the Midheaven: Confusion or dissatisfaction with your
career, your parents, or your home life clouds your decision-making abil-
ity. To find purpose and resolution, listen to your inner voice. Or talk to
your grandparents. As always with Neptune, help can be found through
art, music, spiritual pursuits, and long walks on the beach.
Neptune dissolves boundaries, creates confusion, invites illusion, and sensi-
tizes the imagination.

Power-Hungry Pluto
In 2006, astronomers reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. This may make a
difference to astrophysicists (though I can’t see why it should). Astrologers
essentially don’t care. In our interpretation of the universe, Pluto is associ-
ated with power, regeneration, and the underworld of the psyche — a place
where alchemy is the operative metaphor and size is deeply, truly meaning-
less. Plutonian transits, which last for two or three years, coincide with peri-
ods of profound change.
 Pluto conjunct the Sun: Your awareness increases. You become obsessed
with your potential and are ultimately unwilling to be anyone other than
your most powerful self. Inappropriate relationships and jobs can drop
away during this critical period. Also important: Unresolved issues
regarding your father or other authority figures need to be addressed. In
the first half of the 21st century, only Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius,
and Pisces will experience this transit.
 Pluto opposite the Sun: Circumstances force you to take control of your
destiny. Relationships may suffer. Despite opposition or conflicts with
authority, you’re determined to act in the most powerful possible way.
Above all, you seek recognition. Constructive action leads to success;
vengeful, fear-based, or egotistical behavior backfires. Over the next
couple of years, a new phase of your life begins.
 Pluto conjunct the Moon: Powerful emotional forces are swirling around
you. You may even have to deal with a death in the family. Concerns that
you may have ignored since childhood reemerge, including issues
regarding your mother. Confronting issues of dependency and inferiority
brings healing and catharsis.
 Pluto opposite the Moon: Emotional turmoil and changing family cir-
cumstances provoke shifts in your domestic environment. Facing the
truth is the only option, painful though it may be.
 Pluto conjunct Mercury: Take yourself seriously. Your mental capacity
is developing, and your insights are more penetrating than ever before.
You’re able to influence others through the spoken or written word.
 Pluto opposite Mercury: Differences in opinion, problems in communi-
cation, and obsessive (or depressive) thoughts may disturb you. Secrets
may be revealed. You also have a chance to communicate in a more
forceful way.
 Pluto conjunct Venus: Jealousy, resentment, or obsessive love may have
you in its grip. Unconsciously you seek a profound connection, and you
can probably find it during this intense — and occasionally miserable —
period.
 Pluto opposite Venus: An emotional crisis can cause a relationship to
either crumble or deepen. Disputes, a clash of value, or unresolved
249
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

sexual issues may need to be addressed. Also, financial problems may
hound you.
 Pluto conjunct Mars: Increased determination and ambition open many
doors. Your increased ability to focus enables you to act with greater
effect. Although you need to find ways to manage your anger, your
energy is transformed.
 Pluto opposite Mars: Upsetting events or circumstances beyond your
control force you to take action and to channel your anger in construc-
tive ways.
 Pluto conjunct Jupiter: Expand the boundaries of your life, and you can
utterly transform it. Opportunities pop up through education, travel,
religion, or the law.
 Pluto opposite Jupiter: Your desire for success and power motivates you
to widen your horizons. Be aware that overestimating yourself is a distinct
possibility. Also, if you’re religious, you may experience a crisis of faith.
 Pluto conjunct Saturn: Shedding your self-imposed chains is far from
easy. This conjunction ushers in a period of intense self-examination and
results in permanent change.
 Pluto opposite Saturn: Outside forces thwart your efforts and force you
to alter your plans during this time of unasked-for change. As always
with Saturn, you benefit from self-control and hard work.
 Pluto conjunct Uranus: If you’ve repressed your individuality, it
reemerges now. Simple rebelliousness leads nowhere. If you have over-
played the flamboyant role, you’re ready to tone down your eccentrici-
ties. If you’ve tried to hide your most idiosyncratic self, embrace it now.
You’ll find unexpected fulfillment.
 Pluto opposite Uranus: Surprising circumstances propel you into the
future, forcing you to come to terms with who you are and who you want
to be.
 Pluto conjunct Neptune: Your dreams, beliefs, and ideals are slowly
shifting.
 Pluto opposite Neptune: Unless you’re well over 100 years old, this tran-
sit isn’t one you have to worry about.
 Pluto conjunct natal Pluto: Not possible.
 Pluto opposite natal Pluto: Not possible (unless you’re 123 years old).
 Pluto conjunct the Ascendant: You’re no longer willing to deny or sup-
press your personal power. A stronger self-image fortifies your resolu-
tion and spurs you to initiate change.
 Pluto opposite the Ascendant: You demand to be recognized for the
powerful person you are, and you want to make an impact on the world.
If a relationship is holding you down in any way, it must go.
250
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

 Pluto conjunct the Midheaven: Your career (or your role in the commu-
nity) enters an era of slow, major shift.
 Pluto opposite the Midheaven: Habits need to change. Over the next
few years, your circumstances at home and your relationship with your
parents will undergo a deep shift.
Pluto brings disintegration, regeneration, and metamorphosis. External con-
flicts with power and internal rumbles within the psyche characterize these
transformative transits.
Warning: The Astrologer’s Curse
If you’re anything like me, you may discover that knowing the rudiments of
transits can fill you with fear. Sooner or later, you’ll notice a troublesome
transit approaching and you’ll start to panic as worst-case scenarios haunt
your imagination. Weeks or months later, you may be surprised to realize that
not one of the disasters has occurred. Major events, whether positive or neg-
ative, require a confluence of influences, which is why the longer you follow
the transits, the more restrained you’re likely to become in your predictions.
The rules of transit interpretation are simple:
 If the configurations in your birth chart don’t make a certain event
possible, it won’t happen, no matter what the transits. Unpredictable
Uranus dancing through your second house of finances cheek to cheek
with bountiful Jupiter brings a lottery bonanza if and only if your birth
chart is littered with aspects for making easy money. The predisposition
has to be there.
 Even with a birth predisposition, a single transit seldom correlates
with a life-altering event. Those dramatic situations arise from a collec-
tion of influences, all pointing in a similar direction.
 Any transit has several possible interpretations. Nothing is predes-
tined. But the energy of the transit must be expressed. The way that
occurs depends on circumstances and on the choices you make.
Here’s a case where foreseeing catastrophe would have been so easy — and
so wrong. Imagine a person whose Sun, Ascendant, and several planets are
being pummeled not only by Saturn but also by Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
Even individually, those distant worlds have been known to make astrologers
twitch. When they all act up at once, it’s hard not to get nervous.
So I wonder what I would have said in 1993 if Toni Morrison, whose chart is
reproduced in Figure 16-4, had asked me for a consultation. Her birth chart is
in the interior part of the wheel. The transiting planets are in the outer part.
251
Chapter 16: The Times of Our Lives: Transits

Looking at that chart, I would have noticed that Saturn, the planet of lessons,
was transiting back and forth over her Sun (and had twice made an exact 
conjunction with it earlier that year); that Uranus and Neptune, traveling in
tandem in the ninth house, were conjunct her Saturn and opposed to her natal
Pluto; and that transiting Pluto had been dueling with her Ascendant for about
a year and was approaching an exact opposition.
Observing all of this, I might have uttered cheerful words about transforma-
tion (Pluto) and responsibility (Saturn). I certainly would have told her that
Saturn transiting through the tenth house often correlates with professional
success. But secretly, I would have been worried. Like a lot of people, I find it
easy to imagine catastrophe.
So what actually happened to Toni Morrison in 1993? She won the Nobel
Prize for Literature. And sure enough, with Saturn in her Sun sign, she had
indeed reaped what she had sown.
The most self-destructive mistake you can make as an astrologer is to allow
your knowledge of transits to become a source of anxiety. Take it from me:
Most of the terrifying things that astrologers agonize over never come to
pass. Don’t waste your time worrying about them.

D
o you know where the Moon is right now? Without looking out the
window, do you remember its phase? Can you name the sign of the
zodiac that it inhabits? Do you know whether it’s waxing or waning?
Don’t feel bad if you don’t know the answer to any of these questions. Except
when the Moon is full, most people don’t have a clue about where it is or
what it’s doing. But thousands of years ago, men and women on every conti-
nent worshipped the Moon and were attentive to all its phases. In those early
cultures, storytellers created a cast of lunar deities, each of whom reflected a
different phase of the moon. In Greece, for example, tomboy Artemis, patron
of girls, was a goddess of the New Moon; Hera, queen of the gods, and
Demeter, mother of Persephone, ruled the Full Moon; and Hecate, a goddess
of a certain age, reigned over witchcraft and the waning lunar crescent.
Unlike ourselves, the people of long ago who worshipped those goddesses
observed the Moon carefully and were fully aware of its location. Over time,
they discovered that the monthly journey of the Moon as it waxed and waned
both reflected and supported the pattern of human activity.
That ancient knowledge is within your grasp. When you understand the Moon
and its fundamental changes, you can choose dates that strengthen your inten-
tions, avoid dates that could lead to frustration or failure, and live your life
according to the rhythms of the cosmos. This chapter tells you how — and
when — to seize the day.

Timing Your Actions by 
the Light of the Moon
How many phases of the Moon are there? It depends on who you ask. In India,
astrologers identify 27 “lunar mansions.” The great 20th century astrologer
(and musician) Dane Rudhyar counted eight phases: New, Crescent, First
Quarter, Disseminating, Full, Gibbous, Last Quarter, and Balsamic (no rela-
tionship to the vinegar). Ancient goddess worshippers, like their contempo-
rary Pagan and Wiccan equivalents, generally acknowledged three phases:
waxing, full, and waning. Today, most people recognize the following four
phases of the Moon:
 New: A time of increasing energy and new beginnings. New Moons are
especially powerful when they coincide with solar eclipses, something
that usually happens twice a year.
 First Quarter: A time of growth, friction, and action.
 Full: A time of illumination when ongoing situations come to a head,
emotions are heightened, and major events take place. Full Moons are
especially dramatic and revealing when they’re also lunar eclipses.
 Last Quarter: A time of completion, release, and fading vitality.
By taking note of these natural rhythms, you can time your activities to maxi-
mum advantage — and you don’t need an astrological calendar either. Just
glance at the Moon whenever you’re out at night, and soon, knowing its
phase will become second nature to you. Table 17-1 describes the approxi-
mate appearance and orientation of the Moon along with the actions best
suited to each phase.

Once a year, there’s a New Moon in your sign. Regardless of whether it comes
before or after your birthday, the highly charged period between those two
days is ideal for setting yearly goals and taking the initial steps toward fulfill-
ing them. If the New Moon happens to fall right on your birthday, congratula-
tions. The coming year promises to be a time of new beginnings.
Using the Moon in the Signs
A helpful way to stay in sync with the Moon is to track its journey through
the zodiac. To do this, use the Moon table in the Appendix, which tells you
exactly when the Moon changes sign for every year from 1930 to 2012. Or get
an astrological calendar. Personally, I wouldn’t be without one.
Although the Appendix has the minimum amount of information you need to
follow the Moon through the signs, astrological calendars contain a great deal
more. Two of the best are Llewellyn’s Daily Planetary Guide and Jim Maynard’s
Celestial Guide or Celestial Influences Calendars. These calendars, both of
which are available in a variety of sizes, also tell you the phases of the Moon,
the aspects it forms with other planets, the timing of eclipses, and the exact
moment when the Moon enters each sign of the zodiac. If you can’t find these
calendars in your favorite bookstore, visit The Astrology Center of America at
www.astroamerica.com to order them.
Knowing the location of the Moon is a lot of fun. Over the years, I’ve found
that I enjoy certain lunar placements more than others. As a writer, I love
Moon in Gemini. I always hope to accomplish a lot on those few days — even
though experience has shown me that Moon in Gemini pulls in out-of-town
visitors and unavoidable engagements more than any other sign and sets the
phone to ringing in a way that seems beyond my control. Nonetheless, when I
do sit at my desk on those days, the words pour out.
255
Chapter 17: The Lunar Advantage: Using Astrology in Daily Life

256
Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 
I love Moon in Virgo, too: It’s ideal for taking care of business — and cleaning
the house. I’m not the most efficient person on the planet, but you’d never
know it on these days.
Watching the Moon as you go about your everyday activities casts them in an
interesting light. But I want to emphasize the importance of doing this in a
casual, nonobsessive way. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting so involved
with the heavens that you lose sight of events right here on Earth.
That said, here’s how to make the most of the Moon’s journey through each
sign:
 Moon in Aries: Be bold. Assert yourself, start short-term projects, do
anything that requires a blast of energy and a spark of courage. Watch
out for temper tantrums.
 Moon in Taurus: Be practical. Begin long-term projects, garden, pay
your bills. Concentrate on jobs that call for patience. Listen to your
body. Take a walk in the woods.
 Moon in Gemini: Converse, read, write in your journal, take pictures.
Buy books, magazines, and stationery. Run errands, take short trips,
change your mind.
 Moon in Cancer: Stay home. Cook, redecorate, call your mother. Spend
time with people you love. Shop for antiques. Walk on the beach. Go out-
side and gaze up at the stars.
 Moon in Leo: Let the good times roll. Be romantic, cavort with children,
learn the tango, attend the theatre, throw a party, dare to approach high-
status people. Be confident.
Getting advice from the Internet
A perceptive monthly or weekly horoscope can
help you align yourself with the cosmos. Here
are two of my favorites:
 Susan Miller’s Astrology Zone: Her monthly
forecasts, available at www.astrology
zone.com, are warm, motivating, deeply
informed, and amazingly specific. She dis-
cusses New Moons and Full Moons and is
especially savvy about eclipses. You can’t
go wrong.
 Rob Brezsny’s Free Will Astrology News-
letter: He doesn’t talk about the planets or
use astrological jargon. He tells stories —
parables — and they don’t always hit the
spot. When they do, they reverberate in the
mind for days. Check him out at www.
freewillastrology.com.

 Moon in Virgo: Take care of the mundane. Scrub the floor, visit the den-
tist, go to the vet, attend to the nitpicky details you otherwise avoid.
This might not sound fun, but the Moon in Virgo is incredibly useful —
and it comes around every month.
 Moon in Libra: Indulge yourself. Go to a concert or museum, do some-
thing artistic, have a beauty treatment, smooth over disagreements.
Form a business partnership. Sign a peace treaty. Get married.
 Moon in Scorpio: Expect intense encounters. Have sex, see your thera-
pist, read a mystery novel, file your taxes, pay your debts, get insurance,
investigate anything.
 Moon in Sagittarius: Explore. Travel, attend a class, talk to a lawyer,
pursue spiritual or philosophical interests, take a bike ride, go the gym,
alter your routine.
 Moon in Capricorn: Be businesslike. Print out your résumé, prepare a
contract, do tasks that involve corporations or other large organiza-
tions. Talk to an older person. Investigate the past. Do your duty.
 Moon in Aquarius: Socialize. Volunteer for a cause. Go online, buy soft-
ware, get together with friends, see an independent film, visit a planetar-
ium. Do something unusual.
 Moon in Pisces: Relax. Meditate, take a nap, space out, listen to music,
go swimming, analyze your dreams. Have an intimate talk or a good cry.
Tracking the Moon in the Houses
Tracking the Moon through the houses of your birth chart is another way to
tap into its power. However, you can only do this if you know the time of your
birth and have identified your rising sign or Ascendant. (For instructions on
how to figure that out, see Chapter 11.)
Say, for example, that you have Leo rising — that is, Leo on the cusp of your
first house. When the Moon is in that sign, it’s traveling through your first
house. Once it swings into Virgo, it enters your second house. And so on.
At any given moment, the Moon is in one sign of the zodiac and one house of
your chart. If you want to get persnickety about it, you could figure out
exactly when the Moon will hit the precise degree of each house cusp. But
who has time for that? Not me. I suggest that you simply note the sign on the
cusp of each house. When the Moon enters that sign, that’s your cue to turn
your attention to the matters of that house. For example:
 Moon in the first house: Do something for yourself. Get a haircut or a
manicure. Schedule an interview, a first date, or a presentation at work.
Your visibility is high, so present yourself with flair. You’ll make a posi-
tive impression.
257
Chapter 17: The Lunar Advantage: Using Astrology in Daily Life

 Moon in the second house: Greater security means greater peace of
mind. Practical and financial matters demand your notice. Pay bills.
Meet with a financial advisor. Have a yard sale. Make important pur-
chases. And if you’re involved with construction in any way, get to 
work.
 Moon in the third house: Feeling restless? Run some errands. Go to
the library. Gather information. Make phone calls. Talk to the neighbors.
Get together with brothers and sisters. Take a short trip. This position
favors reading, writing, and anything having to do with school.
 Moon in the fourth house: Focus on home, family, parents, and the past.
 Moon in the fifth house: Romance, recreation, creative pursuits, and
anything having to do with children are enhanced during these few days.
 Moon in the sixth house: The emphasis is on work, health, and the rou-
tines of daily life. Clear your desk. Organize your files. Catch up on every-
thing you let slide. Also: Start a diet. Go to the gym. Get a checkup. Take
care of yourself.
 Moon in the seventh house: If you’re married, set your needs aside and
focus on your mate. If you have a business partner or you deal with the
public at large, put your attention there. This house is all about coopera-
tion, but it also rules your adversaries. When the Moon is in the seventh
house, other people are in control — like it or not.
 Moon in the eighth house: When the Moon is in the domain of sex, death,
regeneration, and other people’s money, you could have an affair, rob a
bank, visit a mortuary, or just — you know — see your shrink, perhaps
about your compulsive behaviors or feelings of dependency. Whatever
you do, the emotional charge is likely to be intense. This is the house of
transformation.
 Moon in the ninth house: Anything that involves publishing, education,
religion, or the law moves forward now. It’s all about expanding your
vision. Traveling to faraway places definitely helps.
 Moon in the tenth house: The emphasis is on career, community affairs,
and your public image. Send out your résumé. Give a speech. Be in the
world.
 Moon in the eleventh house: See friends. Let them remind you of your
most cherished aspirations. Or join a group. Whether it’s the Audubon
Society or the Democratic Party, you benefit from the association.
 Moon in the twelfth house: Retreat. Rejuvenate yourself with solitude
and sleep. This is the house of the unconscious and of self-undoing. So
heed your dreams — and don’t do anything rash.

Making the Most of Momentous
Lunar Influences
The Moon cruises through the zodiac faster than any other planet, so worry-
ing about it as it spins through one sign after another can drive you crazy.
Most transits of the Moon make no difference whatsoever and can be safely
ignored. Nevertheless, a few monthly lunar transits offer opportunities that
are too valuable to miss. Here are the top five monthly influences:
 The Moon in your Sun sign: Your personal power is at its peak. You are
your most charismatic self during these few days, making them a fine
time to schedule important meetings, blind dates, or anything that
requires you to be at your outgoing best.
 The Moon in the sign opposite your Sun sign: Your personal power is
weak. You’re at the beck and call of others, and your plans are likely to
be scuttled or interrupted. Expect interference.
 The Moon in your Moon sign: Your emotions flow freely, whether you
want them to or not. You’re more sensitive and easily hurt than usual,
but you’re also more attuned to emotional subtleties and unconscious
motivations. Listen to your intuition.
 Dark of the Moon: At the end of the lunar cycle, the Moon is so close to
the Sun that it’s invisible. During this period of decrease, attempts to
launch new ventures fizzle, and hopelessness often abounds. Instead of
exerting yourself in a fruitless attempt to influence events, put the finish-
ing touches on undertakings that are nearing conclusion. Also, get plenty
of sleep, secure in the knowledge that the New Moon means a fresh start.
 New Moon: Make wishes, set goals, and inaugurate new projects.
Finally, I want to mention one other momentous lunar influence: the eclipse. If
you’ve ever watched an eclipse, you know how eerie it can be. A solar
eclipse, which takes place during a New Moon, literally turns day to night. A
lunar eclipse, which happens during the Full Moon, seems to erase the Moon
from the sky. No wonder ancient people told so many myths about them.
Followers of astrology also have myths, one of which is that eclipses always
bring bad news. That’s flat out false. But people are afraid of change, and
change is what eclipses are about. When an eclipse — or a series of eclipses —
hits your chart, it brings a burst of cosmic energy that can shake things up. I’ve
seen eclipses usher in hideous divorces, and I’ve seen them bring true love.
Eclipses slam some doors shut — and open others. And sometimes, they do
nothing much at all . . . until later. An eclipse can have a delayed effect.
259
Chapter 17: The Lunar Advantage: Using Astrology in Daily Life

A good astrological calendar will tell you when — and where — to expect an
eclipse. Notice its location by sign and by house. Those are the areas where
change is on its way.
Avoiding the Void
Picture this: The Moon spins into a new sign — let’s say Taurus — and begins
to connect with the planets. It conjuncts Jupiter in the evening (a splendid
sight), trines Venus a few minutes later, squares the Sun the next morning,
opposes Mars at noon, conjuncts Saturn during All Things Considered, and
then sextiles Mercury. After that . . . nothing: No more major aspects. A few
hours later, it enters Gemini, and the process begins anew.
That span, between the Moon’s last major aspect in one sign and its entrance
into the next, can last anywhere from a few seconds to a day or longer. During
that time, the Moon is said to be void-of-course. If the word “void” makes you
nervous, you sense the problem. When the Moon is void-of-course, things fall
apart and judgment goes awry. Though ordinary activities are unaffected,
business deals made during that time tend to crumble, and decisions, how-
ever carefully made, turn out to be wrong-headed.
The usual advice for a void-of-course Moon is to postpone anything important
(like a job interview, wedding, or presidential campaign) and to avoid jumping
into anything new. But let’s get real: You’d have to be unnaturally vigilant to live
that way. The Moon goes void-of-course every couple of days, and to worry
about it on a regular basis is insane. I used to dismiss it entirely. And then one
day a publisher called out of the blue, asked me to write a book on a subject I
love, and requested a meeting. I agreed to the suggested time even though the
Moon was void-of-course. The meeting couldn’t have been more exciting. We
hit it off perfectly, saw eye to eye on everything, and enthusiastically agreed to
terms. Yet the project died. Would it have made a difference if I’d scheduled the
meeting for another time? Perhaps not. Nonetheless, after that disappointment
I began to pay attention to the void-of-course Moon, and I have found that it
does indeed have an effect.
Still, most of the time, I ignore it. But when I’m scheduling an event I care
about, launching a long-term enterprise, planning a vital interview, or making
a large purchase (cars and appliances count; paperback books don’t), I check
my handy astrological calendar and — if at all possible — I avoid the void.

 Considering other retrograde planets
I
t’s amazing how many people there are who can’t cast a horoscope, don’t
know their rising signs, and yet practically have panic attacks over the 
retrograde movement of Mercury. These supposedly sinister periods, during
which that little planet appears to travel backward, arrive regularly three or
four times a year. And yes, they do usher in a volley of setbacks, misunder-
standings, irritations, and minor disruptions. Worse yet, they stir up a storm
of fear and anxiety in the hearts of astrology fans everywhere. But is this
reaction called for? In a word, no. Retrograde motion isn’t a tragedy. It isn’t 
a disaster. It isn’t even a cause for alarm. It’s a respite and a gift from the
cosmos — but only if you understand its purpose and use it appropriately. 
In this chapter, I tell you what you need to know to grapple calmly and ration-
ally with retrograde movements.
Retrograde Revealed
When a planet is retrograde, it looks like it’s reeling backward through the
zodiac. In truth, the planets move forward constantly, but that’s not the way
it looks. Although the Sun and the Moon clearly revolve in the same direction
all year every year, the planets seem to follow a less consistent pattern. On a
regular schedule, each of the planets appears to slow down, reverse direc-
tion, and retrace its path, arcing backward across the zodiac. For weeks or
months at a time (depending on the planet), it wheels against the planetary
tide. Then once again, it seems to slow down, turn around, and resume
normal movement (which is referred to as going direct).

When ancient astronomers saw the heavenly bodies whirling backward, they
invented all kinds of schemes to account for the phenomenon. In the second
century BCE, for example, astronomers in Greece were convinced that the
planets looped around their usual orbits on little spheres carved from the
purest crystal. Needless to say, they were wrong. The planets never actually
switched direction.
Retrograde motion is solely a perception — an illusion caused by the fact
that the planets, including Earth, are always in motion, tracing arcs across
the sky as they loop around the Sun at varying speeds. You can experience
the same disconcerting effect in a train. If two trains pull out of the station
together but your train is moving faster, the train on the adjacent track
appears to slide backward. That backward motion, like the retrograde motion
of the planets, is an optical illusion.
Successfully Handling
Retrograde Mercury
Here’s a typical scenario from my life: The phone rings. I pick it up hesitantly
(because, like most people, I have a teeny bit of telephone ESP). And indeed,
it’s one of the usual suspects calling in a frenzy after having experienced one
frustration too many. The final straw may be a lost ATM card, an endless wait
in the doctor’s office, a missed appointment, a computer crash, the inability to
rent an apartment at 1977 prices, a voice mail disaster, or another harrowing
descent into an HMO inferno. Listening to the litany, I know what’s coming. My
faithful follower is about to ask this question: Is Mercury retrograde?
Often, the answer is yes. Tiny Mercury, the planet nearest the Sun, appears to
change direction more frequently than any other planet. It goes into “reverse”
three or four times a year for around three weeks at a stretch. During those
irksome interludes — and particularly at the beginning and end — you can
expect small mishaps, petty annoyances, and all sorts of miscommunication.
When Mercury is retrograde, messages disappear in cyberspace, straightfor-
ward statements are misinterpreted, people forget appointments and lose
papers, and answering machines, faxes, copiers, computers, and cellphones
threaten to strike.
Making the best of it
Why crazy things happen when Mercury is retrograde, I can’t claim to know.
Astrology, to my way of thinking, is a system of metaphor, a symbolic cosmic
language that reflects our lives the way the sea reflects the sky. So even
though none of the planets ever actually spin backward, their apparent turn-
around subtly affects our reactions, our perceptions, and our experiences.

Part IV: Using Astrology Right Now 

When Mercury is retrograde, vexation abounds. Yet despite what you may
have heard — and despite the inventory of possible woes I listed earlier in
the chapter — retrograde Mercury isn’t to be feared. It’s a lesser force, not a
tsunami. It forces you to slow down (because you’re stuck in a traffic jam), to
be flexible (because your flight just got canceled), to check on things you
might normally ignore (because your package should have arrived by now). It
encourages you to try another approach. Thus it offers something most
people desperately need: a timeout, a chance to pick up the pieces.
When Mercury is retrograde, do not
 Launch an important project.
 Purchase a computer, a cellphone, a Blackberry, or any other communi-
cation device, including expensive fountain pens.
 Buy a car, a boat, or a home.
 Move into a new dwelling.
 Start a job.
 Begin a relationship.
 Sign a contract.
 Expect things to go smoothly.
 Try to fight the fates. Forcing things to happen on your schedule only
creates further mayhem.
To get the most out of Mercury retrograde, breathe a sigh of relief and get off
that treadmill. You’ve been given a reprieve. All you have to do is
 Review.
 Revise. (Mercury retrograde is invaluable for writers.)
 Reconsider. (If a former lover or an old problem reappears, Mercury 
retrograde can help you resolve the situation.)
 Revisit the past.
 Change your mind.
 Confirm your reservations.
 Check the facts.
 Make repairs.
 Do tasks you’ve been postponing.
 Correct mistakes.
 Get organized.
 Catch up on all forms of correspondence.
263
Chapter 18: Retrograde Hell? The Truth Revealed

 Clear the decks.
 Send cards and packages early. (When Mercury is retrograde, mail may
not arrive on time.)
 Carry a book or magazine at all times. (When Mercury is retrograde,
your chances of having to wait in a line or being caught in a traffic jam
increase exponentially. And don’t count on your cellphone to keep you
entertained: It’s likely to transmit only static.)
Knowing when the hullabaloo is coming
Table 18-1 shows you when (and where) Mercury is retrograde from the first
day of 2007 to the last day of 2012. The dates for each retrograde period cor-
respond to the degrees of the zodiac listed in the “Location” column.
For example, the first line for the year 2007 shows that Mercury is retrograde
from February 14 until March 7, during which time it wheels backward from
10° Pisces — its location on February 14 — to 25° Aquarius, where it ends up
on March 7. At that point on March 7 it ceases to be retrograde. For a brief
moment, Mercury seemingly stands still. Then it goes direct, moving forward
once more in the usual way. Months pass. From its starting point at 25°
Aquarius, Mercury spins happily through one-third of the zodiac. And then,
on June 15, it changes direction once again, this time at 11° Cancer. And so
the cycle begins anew.

Sometimes the weeks when Mercury is retrograde slip by so quietly that you
barely notice. Other times, retrograde Mercury generates such a blizzard of
delays and obstructions that you just can’t miss its baleful influence. What
makes the difference? The answer is easy: location, location, location. Look
to see where Mercury is when it goes retrograde. If it’s in your Sun sign, Moon
sign, Mercury sign, or rising sign, you’ll feel its impact. Similarly, when Mercury
begins or ends its retrograde cycle within one or two degrees of a planet in
your horoscope, you’re likely to be affected. In both cases, get ready to revel
in the rhythm of retrograde. And don’t forget to bring a book.
Looking Out for Retrograde Venus
In Meso-American astrology, Venus ruled. The Aztecs and Mayans kept care-
ful note of its rising and setting, its arrival as the morning star and as the
evening star, its regular disappearances, and its intervals of retrograde
motion, which occur every year and a half for about six weeks. According to
Aztec astrologers, those retrograde weeks were dangerous times, especially
in the political arena. Astrologers today generally see retrograde Venus as a
time of uncertainty, distraction, misinterpretation, passivity, and unfulfilled
desires in two areas: romance and finance.
It sounds bad, yet in reality, the effects are subtle. It seems to me that life is too
short to worry excessively about this particular transit. In a strange way, I even
find it comforting. For example, if your love life is less than spectacular — if it’s
nonexistent — then retrograde Venus gives you license to forget about it for a
while and turn your mind to other matters. What a relief.
265
Chapter 18: Retrograde Hell? The Truth Revealed

I do, however, have two iron-clad pieces of advice:
 Don’t get married when Venus is retrograde (unless both you and your
intended have retrograde Venus in your birth chart).
 Don’t make any major financial commitments when Venus is retrograde —
especially for a loan, a mortgage, a fur coat, an original piece of artwork,
an emerald ring (emerald is the gem of Taurus, which Venus rules), or any-
thing beloved by Venus (except for flowers, chocolates, and valentines).
Table 18-2 tells you when (and where) Venus is retrograde from 2007 to 2012.
(2008 and 2011 aren’t listed because Venus doesn’t go retrograde during

Watching Out for Retrograde Mars
I love Mars, the red planet. Easily recognizable in the sky by its pale pink tint,
it stimulates activity, prods us to take the initiative, and fills us with courage.
Mars is enterprising, dynamic, determined, and dominating. True, it’s also the
planet of hostility and war. But without it, nothing would ever get done.
I like to think that in my chart, and in yours, the energy that motivates Mars
can be funneled in positive directions. If nothing else, it thrives at the gym —
and I’m not talking about yoga or the stationary bicycle. Mars prefers kickbox-
ing. Let’s be honest: Mars wants to fight. The harder you work out, the better.
But when Mars is retrograde, that energy is diverted. Roadblocks pop up out
of nowhere, and the anger and belligerence associated with the warrior
planet are driven underground. So progress slows down, even at the gym.
Instigating new pursuits leads nowhere, and taking the offensive — or trying
to — can create unanticipated consequences.
266

Aggressive Mars goes retrograde every 22 months for about 11 weeks. During
those times, the cardinal rule is simple: Don’t launch a crusade or go to war,
metaphorically or otherwise.
Table 18-3 tells you when (and where) Mars is retrograde from 2007 to 2012.

The Other Planets
Past Mars, the planets are retrograde for months on end, and the whole
matter becomes unimportant. Most of the time, there’s no reason to get bent
out of shape about retrograde planets beyond Mars.
I recommend paying attention to the retrograde motion of the outer planets
under only two circumstances:
 When five or six planets are retrograde at once. Those are times
when new endeavors inch forward at glacial speed. How do you
know when planets are retrograde? I regret to say that this book can’t
help you. But any good astrological calendar can. The best ones are
Llewellyn’s Astrological Calendars (I’m partial to the Daily Planetary
Guide) and the Celestial Guide and Celestial Influences calendars pub-
lished by Jim Maynard.
 When a planet turns retrograde or direct right on top of (or opposite
to) your birth planet. For instance, if Saturn (or any other planet) goes
retrograde at 10° Leo and you happen to have a planet right there, you
can expect to suffer the consequences. A problem from the past, some-
thing you thought was totally over, could arise. You’ll have to contend
with the same issues all over again. Your best and only move, taking
your cue from Saturn, is to face reality.

Retrograde Mercury, Venus, and Mars 
in the birth chart
Years ago, I was under the impression that when
a planet was retrograde, its energy was weak-
ened. I changed my opinion when I noticed that
some of the smartest, most articulate people I
know have Mercury retrograde in their birth
charts, as do some of my favorite writers —
icons like M. F. K. Fisher, Robert Frost, Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, Henry Miller, Philip Roth, Dylan
Thomas, and J. R. R. Tolkien. Clearly, Mercury
retrograde in a birth chart doesn’t negate the
ability to communicate. Rather, it bends your
intellect inward, deepens it, increases your need
for reflection, causes greater concern about
exactly how you’re communicating, and makes
you a more independent and contemplative
thinker. My guess is that writers with Mercury
retrograde spend more time mulling things over
and revising than other writers.
If you have retrograde Venus in your birth chart,
you may be shy, uncertain, and hesitant to
express affection, especially around potential
partners. Romance isn’t a lighthearted romp for
you — much as you wish it were. It’s complex
and problematic, a matter for serious reflection,
and as a result, you may hold yourself back 
in romantic situations. But don’t despair. Venus 
retrograde doesn’t deny romance. It merely
slows it down. For instance, I know a good-
hearted man with Venus retrograde who married
a woman from another country — but never lived
with or slept with her — simply to help her get a
visa. He later found his true love — and his first
“wife” was a guest at his second wedding.
Retrograde Mars makes an issue of aggression
by forcing you to acknowledge your anger and
focus it constructively. Some people with a retro-
grade Mars — Lizzie Borden comes to mind —
never find a way to do this. Others succeed tri-
umphantly. This list of world-class warriors
speaks for itself: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Billie
Jean King, Jesse Jackson, and Martin Luther
King, Jr. They all have Mars retrograde.

here do extraordinary qualities come from? What goes into the chart
of a world-class beauty, a groundbreaking artist, a celebrity, or a bil-
lionaire? These people obviously have something special . . . and maybe you
do too. In the following sections, I reveal the astrological secrets behind great
gifts.
Artistic Ability
Every sign has its complement of artists. But the all-time greats — geniuses
like Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso — belong to a category all their
own. Here are some indicators of artistic talent:
 By sign: Taurus, Libra, and Leo sustain artistic talent. Look for the Sun,
Moon, Ascendant, Midheaven, or Venus in those signs.
 By planet: A prominent Venus and Neptune quicken the aesthetic sense
and the imagination.
 By house: An active fifth house accentuates your need to be creative.
A planet is prominent when it’s within 8° of your Ascendant or
Midheaven; when it occupies an angle (that is, it’s in the first, fourth,
seventh, or tenth house of your chart); or when it makes close aspects
to other planets.
A house is active either when it holds one or more planets or when its
ruler is in a prominent position.

Consider the chart of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (see Figure 19-1). During her
lifetime, she wasn’t as famous as her muralist husband, Diego Rivera. In
recent years, her anguished, colorful canvases have attracted many admirers,
and her fame has skyrocketed. Here’s how her chart stacks up to the factors
described earlier in this section:
 By sign: Two of the three signs on the list are central in Kahlo’s chart.
Taurus holds the Moon and the Midheaven, while Leo is the home of her
Ascendant and her Mercury. Only Libra is vacant.
 By planet: Both Venus and Neptune are prominent in her chart. Venus
rules her Midheaven, conjuncts Pluto, and sextiles her Ascendant.
Neptune is closely conjunct her Sun.
 By house: Two planets — Uranus, the planet of originality, and Mars —
inhabit the fifth house (along with the South Node). Also, the ruler of the
fifth house, Jupiter, is conjunct her Sun in the sign of its exaltation, making
it exceptionally well-placed.
Frida Kahlo struggled with heart-rending difficulties during her short life, but
lack of artistic talent was not among them.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Athletic Prowess
Mighty Mars, the planet of aggression, figures strongly in the charts of athletes,
who are statistically more likely than nonathletes to have Mars within striking
distance of either the Midheaven or the Ascendant. (The specific areas near
the Midheaven are the ninth house and first ten degrees of the tenth. The sensi-
tive areas near the Ascendant are the twelfth house and the first ten degrees of
the first house.) You see these positions in the charts of Muhammad Ali and
Tiger Woods, both Capricorns. Ali has a tenacious Mars in Taurus conjunct the
Midheaven. Tiger has a similar setup, with an impatient Mars in Gemini con-
junct his Midheaven.
Mars can also be prominent for other reasons. For instance, I don’t know
whether Lance Armstrong has an angular Mars. Angularity depends on birth
time, and I don’t have that information about him. I do know this: His Mars in
Aquarius aspects all but one of his other planets, making it very active indeed.
Mars can also dominate a chart in the opposite situation: When it makes no
aspects whatsoever. Such a solitary planet, unhampered by other planets
with competing agendas, operates without interference and can conse-
quently be the strongest influence in a chart.
I don’t want to suggest that Mars is the only planet that affects athletic ability.
A well-placed Sun gives vitality. Mercury lends quickness. Jupiter, Uranus, and
Pluto confer power. Athleticism, like other talents, is an amalgamation of many
factors.
Finally, although gifted athletes are born under every sign of the zodiac, fire
and earth signs are slightly more common among them than air and water.
Athletes, like artists, benefit from a touch of Leo — not because it advances
athletic ability (Leos, I have noticed, can be amazingly klutzy) but because it
stimulates the love of performance. And that is definitely part of the game.
Beauty (Or the Power of Attraction)
If Mars promotes athletic ability, Venus amplifies beauty, particularly when it is
 Conjunct the Ascendant, the Sun, the Moon, the Midheaven, or the ruler
of the Ascendant.
 In the first or tenth house.
 In Taurus or Libra, the signs it rules.
Brooke Shields, for instance, was a recognized beauty even as an infant, when
her modeling career began. Her Venus sits at the top of her chart, conjoining
her Midheaven. Angelina Jolie, whose very name advertises her prettiness,
has Venus closely conjunct her Ascendant.
273
Chapter 19: Ten Talents You Can Spot in a Chart

Not everyone with a prominent Venus boasts a gorgeous face. What they do
have is even more valuable: the power of attraction. An example is former
President Bill Clinton. He’s a Leo (of course) with Venus in the first house in
sociable Libra, the sign it rules. His Venus makes four conjunctions and two sex-
tiles. So he easily attracts admirers. Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand,
has Venus in Scorpio, the sign of its detriment. With Venus conjunct her ruling
planet (Mercury), she can be charming. But her Venus squares Saturn, Pluto,
and Mars and makes an irritating (135°) angle to the Moon and Ascendant. Not
surprisingly, as a public personality, she has to work harder to make her case.
Celebrity Appeal
Known for his silk-screened portraits and provocative paintings of Campbell’s
soup cans (and electric chairs), Andy Warhol is also remembered for his pre-
scient statement, “In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.”
Well, that was easy for him to say. He had all the ingredients that celebrity
appeal requires (see Figure 19-2):
 Planets conjunct the Midheaven and/or in the tenth house
 Planets conjunct the Ascendant and/or in the first house
 A touch of Leo

Specifically, he had Jupiter (and Chiron) conjunct the Midheaven, Mars in the
tenth house, the Sun closely conjunct the Ascendant, and two planets —
Venus and Neptune, the planets of art — in the first house. Plus, he had four
planets and the Ascendant in Leo. Fame was his birthright.
Why is Paris Hilton a celebrity? I don’t think it’s that sex video (not that I’ve
seen it). Nor is it her wealth (although her second house of money is loaded).
It’s something else: She has the astrological fingerprint for fame (see Figure
19-3). Planets conjunct the Midheaven? She’s got two of them, including
Jupiter, her ruling planet. Plus, Pluto is in the tenth house. Planets conjunct
the Ascendant? Glamorous Neptune is right there. And, sure enough, she’s
got some Leo going on: the Moon and the North Node in the eighth house of
sex and other people’s money. Her fame is no accident.
Healing Hands
Doctors, nurses, acupuncturists, kind-hearted dentists, and others with the
desire to heal share certain astrological characteristics:
 By sign: Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, the water signs, promote empathy.
Virgo encourages an intellectual curiosity about health and healing tech-
niques. Aquarius heightens humanitarian concern.

 By planet: Research has shown that doctors often have Saturn conjunct
or opposite the Ascendant or Midheaven. Pluto, the planet of transfor-
mation, and Mars also figure heavily in the charts of healers.
 By house: The most crucial placements related to health are the sixth
house of health and service; the eighth house of surgery, research,
death, and rebirth; and the twelfth house of secrets and hospitals.
A house is powerful if it holds one or more planets, but even an empty house
can be vital. If the ruler of that house is conjunct the Sun, Moon, Ascendant,
or Midheaven, the matters of that house gain importance.
Business Savvy
How are Fortune 500 CEOs different from you and me (other than the fact
that they fly around in private jets)? Here’s how to spot executive ability:
 By sign: Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn are the preeminent signs of business.
Equally important is Scorpio, the sign of power politics, covert operations,
and self-control. In business, as in other areas, you can also expect to see a
little Leo. That’s because Leos long to be on top, and they’ll happily put in
hours — make that years — of overtime to achieve that noble goal.
 By planet: Saturn, well-situated by sign, house, and aspect, grants orga-
nizational ability; Mercury provides skill in communication; and Mars
fuels the competitive drive.
 By house: Look for planets in the tenth house of reputation, the sixth
house of work, the second house of money, and the eighth house of
investment. Those houses support executive ability. Also, planets in the
first house can bestow considerable charisma, which is often the defin-
ing trait of a successful CEO.
Jack Welch, chairman and CEO of General Electric for 20 years, shows many
of these traits (see Figure 19-4):
 By sign: With planets in all three earth signs, a Capricorn Ascendant,
and the Sun in Scorpio, Welch shows clear organizational ability.
 By planet: Saturn rules his Ascendant and is therefore his ruling planet.
Mercury is conjunct his Midheaven. But his most notable planet is his
commanding, ambitious Mars. It’s angular (in the first house), closely
conjunct his Ascendant, well-aspected, and in the sign of its exaltation,
all of which makes him exceptionally competitive and aggressive.
 By house: His Sun is in the tenth house of career and public life and is
conjunct expansive Jupiter, which is another mark of leadership ability.
His Moon is in the eighth house of investments, along with two other
planets, and his ruler, Saturn, is in the second house of money.
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Say what you will about the corporate world, that’s where Jack Welch belongs.
Making Money
These are the traditional markers that point to the ability to amass money and
material goods, whether through your own efforts or through sheer good luck:
 Planets in the second and eighth houses.
 Powerful, well-aspected planets ruling the second and eighth houses.
 A well-placed Jupiter. If you’re lucky, it will connect with the second and
eighth houses.
A glance at Jack Welch’s chart (Figure 19-4) shows just what you might
expect: He has four planets in the second and eighth houses, including
Saturn, the ruler of his Ascendant. The ruler of his second house, Neptune, is
conjunct the Moon in the eighth house. The ruler of his eighth house,
Mercury, is conjunct the Midheaven. As for Jupiter, it’s powerful by sign
(because it’s in Sagittarius, the sign it rules); by house (because it’s in the
tenth house of reputation); and by aspect (because it’s conjunct his Sun).

Psychic Ability
Whether you call it extrasensory perception, clairvoyance, a sixth sense, or
plain old intuition, psychic ability isn’t as rare as you might think. Here’s how
to find it:
 By sign: Pisces, Scorpio, and Cancer bolster psychic ability. Sagittarius
can also foster a tendency in that direction.
 By planet: Neptune and the Moon keep the channels of reception open
(especially when they’re conjunct). A prominent Uranus can bring
flashes of insight and understanding. Pluto also boosts perception, espe-
cially if it aspects the Sun, Moon, Mercury, or the Ascendant. I’m not
sure it’s actually psychic, but if your powers of observation are acute, no
one can tell the difference.
 By house: The twelfth, eighth, and fourth houses carry the most weight.
A classic illustration of psychic ability gone wild is the renowned healer
Edgar Cayce, who worked as a “psychic diagnostician” (his term) by entering
a trance and suggesting cures for clients he had never even met.
His chart (Figure 19-5) showed all the indications of psychic ability. He had
the Sun and three planets in Pisces, three planets in the eighth house, a
Moon/Neptune conjunction in the tenth house, and Uranus rising.

Becoming an Astrologer
Becoming a skilled astrologer has nothing to do with psychic ability.
Astrology is an accumulated body of knowledge — not the mystic ability to
intercept messages from the spirit world. Anyone can learn it. But you’re
more likely to be interested if you have some of the following in your chart:
 A prominent Uranus.
 Activity in Aquarius and/or an active eleventh house. When I began
studying astrology, I heard that two specific degrees often showed up in
astrologers’ charts: 25° Aquarius and 25° Leo. I’m not sure I believe that.
 Activity in Scorpio and/or the eighth house. Scorpio is subtle and inci-
sive. It feels at home with contradictions and hidden motivations, and it
loves to ferret out a mystery — and that’s what astrology is all about.
Case in point: Isabel M. Hickey, whose 1970 book, Astrology: A Cosmic Science,
2nd edition (CRCS Publications, 1992), has inspired generations of
astrologers. Look what she had going for her (see Figure 19-6): Uranus rising
in her first house; Saturn in Aquarius; a Scorpio Ascendant; the Sun in Leo at
25°, one of the so-called astrologer’s degrees; and a sensitive Moon/Neptune
conjunction in the eighth house.

Writing
It’s astonishing how many people fantasize about writing. Here’s what it takes
to be a success:
 By sign: Great writers are born under every sign of the zodiac, but
Gemini is especially haunted by the urge to write. Having the Sun, Moon,
Mercury, Ascendant, or Midheaven in the sign of the Twins encourages
writing ability.
 By planet: Becoming a successful writer requires a robust Mercury.
Mercury is strong if it rules the Ascendant or Midheaven, if it’s in Gemini
or Virgo, if it makes close aspects to other planets, and if it’s in the third,
sixth, ninth, or tenth houses. Don’t fret if your Mercury is retrograde.
That placement is so common among the authors I admire that I’ve
started to wonder whether it’s actually an advantage.
Saturn, the planet of self-discipline, is essential. Imaginative Neptune
can be pivotal, especially in writing poetry, fiction, and song lyrics.
The Moon is arguably the most important planet, as the researcher
Michel Gauquelin discovered. He found that creative writers are more
likely than nonwriters to have the Moon in one of the so-called zones
of power: either overhead (that is, in the ninth house or conjunct
the Midheaven in the tenth) or rising (in the first house conjunct the
Ascendant or in the twelfth house of secrets and solitude).
 By house: Look for activity in the third house of communication, the
ninth house of publication, and the fifth house of creativity.
To observe this in real life, take a look at novelist Toni Morrison’s chart (see
Chapter 16). She doesn’t have every one of the characteristics listed above.
Then again, no one does. But her Mercury is conjunct her Midheaven; Venus,
the ruler of her Ascendant, is in the ninth house of publication conjunct
Saturn; two planets are in the third house (with one more knocking at the
gate); and Neptune, the planet of the imagination, is located in the fifth house
of creativity. By becoming a writer, she fulfilled the potential of her chart.

Ten (Plus One) Ways to Use
Astrology in Your Life:
The Art of Timing
In This Chapter
 Making your move when the time is right
 Knowing when to hold back and wait
I
f timing is everything, then astrology is the key to success — not natal
astrology, which has to do with your birth chart, but electional astrology,
the intricate, high-pressure art of choosing a favorable date in advance. By
applying its principles, you can choose auspicious times, avoid problematical
ones, align yourself with the cosmos, and increase your chances of having a
happy outcome. In this chapter, I show you how.
To partake of the wonders of celestial timing, you must have an astrological
calendar. I like Llewellyn’s Daily Planetary Guide and Jim Maynard’s Celestial
Guide and Celestial Influences calendars, but there are others. You can take a
close look at them online and order them through the Astrology Center of
America at www.astroamerica.com.
Getting Married
More than any other event, a request to choose a wedding date can cause an
astrologer to leaf frantically through the ephemeris in quest of the perfect
day and then to throw her arms up in despair. Given the marriage statistics, it
won’t surprise you to hear that ideal days are hard to come by — and that
even astrologers get divorced.

Still, certain celestial events improve your chances of making it past your
paper anniversary. One of the most encouraging is a transit of Jupiter
through your seventh house of marriage. The problem is that Jupiter only
returns to your seventh house every twelve years, and you may not want to
wait that long.
Some astrological influences, on the other hand, occur fairly frequently and
are worth waiting for. Here’s what to look for when you name the day:
 Make certain that Venus, the planet of love, is direct. If it happens to be
retrograde, postpone your wedding for a few weeks. (See Chapter 18 for
more about retrograde Venus.)
 Choose a day when Mercury is direct, not retrograde. With retrograde
Mercury, misunderstandings and problems in communication are likely
to arise, either immediately or down the line. Also, it’s never a good
idea to sign a contract when Mercury is retrograde. Marriage, whatever
else it may be, is a legal agreement — and you will have to sign on the
dotted line.
 Choose the position of the Moon with care. A New Moon, with the Sun
and the Moon conjunct, classically signals a new beginning. The best
possible Moon for a wedding is a New Moon in your sign (or your part-
ner’s), in your seventh house of marriage, or in Libra.
As an example, take a look at Nicole Kidman’s chart in Chapter 3. She
has Scorpio rising. So Taurus is on the cusp of her seventh house. Thus,
if she were to get married a third time, she might want to do it after a
New Moon in Taurus.
 If a New Moon isn’t possible, for whatever reasons, at least get married
when the Moon is waxing — that is, when it’s between New and Full,
becoming larger and more luminous every night. A waning Moon has
passed its peak of luminosity and is on the downward slide, getting
smaller and dimmer every moment. Who needs that symbolism?
 Look for an auspicious angle between the Sun and the Moon. A sextile
(60°) or trine (120°) creates harmony. A tight 90° square or 180° opposi-
tion generates tension and conflict.
 Look for trines and sextiles involving the Moon, Venus, and Jupiter —
the more the better.
 Make sure the Moon isn’t void-of-course. And make sure that your
schedule has room for error, just in case the flower girl is late.
The Moon is void-of-course when it has made its last major aspect in one sign
but has not yet entered the next. The void-of-course period always comes at
the end of the Moon’s journey through a sign. To avoid a void-of-course
Moon, schedule an event shortly after the Moon enters a new sign. (For more
about the void-of-course Moon, turn to Chapter 17.)
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Going on a First Date
In the real world, if someone you’re interested in asks you out, the last thing
you want to do is announce that the Moon is waning, so you’d rather wait
two weeks for that mojito. On the other hand, if you have any control over
the matter, you might decide that you don’t mind waiting. Here’s how to
schedule a date that might lead to another:
 Pay attention to the Moon. Look for a waxing Moon, meaning a Moon
that’s somewhere between New and Full. Make certain that the Moon is
not void-of-course because relationships begun under a void-of-course
Moon are less likely to go the distance. And choose a moon sign that’s
either warm and sensitive — like Cancer, Pisces, or Taurus — or fun, like
Gemini, Leo, or Sagittarius.
 Look for harmonious aspects — that is, conjunctions, sextiles, or trines —
between the Moon and Venus. Any good astrological calendar will list
these. (For more about aspects, turn to Chapter 13.)
 Watch your planetary transits. Jupiter in your fifth house is a propitious
influence that can ease the misery of dating even for those who hate the
process. It spends about a year in your fifth house — but it only comes
around every twelve years, so it behooves you to take advantage of it.
 Look at the transits of the Sun, the Moon, Venus, or Mars through that
sector of your horoscope.
 A once-a-year New Moon in your fifth house of romance is definitely a
door to romance, as is the once-a-year Full Moon that takes place six
months later. Don’t be shy.
Opening a Business
Launching a business isn’t so different from starting a marriage, and some of
the same rules apply. To wit:
 Make sure that Mercury, the planet that rules contracts, isn’t retrograde.
The same goes for Venus, the planet of money.
 Start your enterprise on or shortly after a New Moon. A New Moon in your
second house (or in Taurus) is ideal if the business is primarily financial
or if it involves material objects. (A New Moon in the second house is also
the right time to ask for a raise.) A New Moon in your sixth house (or in
Virgo) is perfect if your business is service-oriented. And a New Moon in
the tenth house (or in Capricorn) supports public awareness of your busi-
ness and guarantees that you’ll be recognized in your field.
283
Chapter 20: Ten (Plus One) Ways to Use Astrology in Your Life

 Look for beneficial aspects (sextiles and trines) between Saturn and
Jupiter. Saturn rules structures and organizations; Jupiter rules luck and
expansion. You want them working together. Avoid squares and opposi-
tions involving those two planets.
An astrological calendar can tell you when an aspect is exact or at its
peak. But an aspect between two planets often creates a buzz even
before the crucial moment, when the aspect is approaching. It’s like
Christmas: You can feel it in the air well in advance of the actual day.
Afterwards, the energy diminishes quickly. I suggest that you scan ahead
in your calendar to see if any major aspects are approaching. Be aware
that if you open your business on a Wednesday, and Thursday there’s an
opposition between Saturn and Jupiter, you’ll feel the tension.
 To make sure that your brainchild gets noticed, launch your enterprise —
by which I mean put up your shingle, cut the ribbon, sign the articles of
incorporation, shake hands with your partner — around midday. That
way, you can be sure that there are planets near the top of the chart. Win
or lose, you won’t go unnoticed.
Scheduling a Meeting
The way you schedule a meeting depends entirely on what you wish to
accomplish. Follow these rules:
 If you hope the meeting will help you inaugurate a program, introduce a
new set of goals, involve a staff member who hasn’t previously partici-
pated in this area, or make a case for organizational change, schedule
the meeting when the Moon is New or, at minimum, waxing.
 To encourage brainstorming, look for a conjunction, sextile, or trine
between Mercury and Uranus, the planet of originality. The Moon in
Gemini also encourages an explosion of ideas.
 If you want the meeting to reach a final decision about an issue that’s
been on the table many times before, schedule it for a time when the
Moon is close to full. Full Moons can be times of high emotion. They’re
very illuminating — they reveal that which has been hidden and they
bring things to a head. If that’s what you have in mind, go ahead.
 Make sure the Moon isn’t void-of-course and that Mercury isn’t
retrograde.
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

On the other hand, if you’re scheduling a meeting to discuss a proposal you
thoroughly oppose, here’s what to do:
 Schedule the meeting during a waning Moon, preferably during the last
few days of the lunar cycle.
 Make certain that the Moon is void-of-course. Many ideas may be floated
at the meeting. Much discussion may occur. But guess what? Nothing
will come of any of it.
Throwing a Party
Once again, it depends on what you have in mind. If you plan to hire a DJ and
throw open the doors to anyone you’ve ever met, these are the rules:
 Let the Moon be in Leo (first choice), Gemini, or Sagittarius, followed by
Libra, Aquarius, or Aries. The fire and air signs are boisterous and
engaging. They may not generate as much intimacy as other signs, but
under their happy influence, the good times roll.
 Look to Venus and Jupiter. If they make conjunctions, sextiles, or trines
to the Sun and the Moon, that’s good news
 To be certain that stern Saturn won’t squeeze the fun right out of your
fête, make sure that it doesn’t make a close conjunction, square, or
opposition to the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Mars, or Jupiter.
On the other hand, if you want to host a quiet family dinner or a champagne
brunch for your dearest friends, Moon in Cancer, Taurus, or Pisces aren’t bad
choices, ensuring that everyone will feel at home, cared for, and well-fed.
Purchasing a Computer
Follow these three simple rules when buying a computer:
 Make sure that Mercury, the planet of communication, isn’t retrograde.
Okay, I know I keep mentioning this influence. It’s always important, but
there are times — I admit it — when you can bend the rules. Not in this
case, though. Do not — I repeat, do not — purchase a computer (or a
car) when Mercury is spinning backward.
 Make sure that Uranus and Mars aren’t doing anything unfortunate.
High-tension squares, oppositions, and conjunctions, especially to
Mercury or the Moon, are just the sort of thing you don’t want to see.
 Check that the Moon isn’t void-of-course.
285
Chapter 20: Ten (Plus One) Ways to Use Astrology in Your Life

It isn’t necessary, but an Aquarian influence — perhaps in the form of the Sun
or Moon in that sign — makes sure that your technology is cutting edge.
Buying a House
Considering that buying a house is the largest purchase most people will ever
make, it’s smart to get the planets on your side — beginning with Jupiter, the
lord of abundance. Once every 12 years, Jupiter travels through your fourth
house. That’s the single best influence for investing in real estate.
But maybe you can’t wait that long. And maybe you can’t wait for the right
economic market to come along either. If you need to buy or sell a house
now, take these suggestions:
 Begin the process of buying with a New Moon in your fourth house or
a New Moon in Cancer. A Full Moon can also work — especially if you’re
selling.
 Make sure the Moon is waxing when you buy a house. If it’s in Taurus,
Cancer, or the sign that’s on the cusp of your fourth house, so much the
better. When you sell a house, it’s okay if the Moon is waning.
 Look for auspicious aspects (trines and sextiles) involving the Sun, the
Moon, and any planets moving through your fourth house.
 To make sure that the sale goes through, never sign a contract
when Mercury is retrograde — and make sure that the Moon isn’t 
void-of-course.
Having Surgery
First, let me be clear: If you need an operation immediately, you need it imme-
diately. Listen to your doctor.
But perhaps you’re undergoing elective surgery. Or maybe your doctor has
given you a choice. That happened to me when I broke my arm in a foreign
country (where I didn’t speak the language). My doctor told me I could have
my elbow operated on right away or I could fly home and have the operation
here. Either way, she said that I had to have the operation within a week.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

In a situation like that, how do you decide? These are the rules:
 Make sure the Moon isn’t in the sign that corresponds to the part of
your body being operated on. Thus, if you’re going to have surgery on
your arm, avoid the Moon in Gemini. If you’re planning to have knee
surgery, make sure the Moon isn’t in Capricorn. And so on.
For a description of the signs and the parts of the bodies associated
with them, see Chapter 1.
 Some people recommend avoiding Moon in Scorpio for any kind of
surgery. The astrologer Susan Miller notes that for cosmetic surgery it’s
smart to avoid Mars in either Aries, which rules the face, or Taurus,
which rules the neck.
 Don’t have surgery when the Moon is full.
 Avoid retrograde Mercury, Venus, or Mars, if possible.
 Look for trines and sextiles to the Sun, the Moon, and the planet that
rules the sign on the cusp of your eighth house (of surgery).
 Look for positive influences, such as Jupiter or Venus in your sixth
house of health.
Starting a Diet or an Exercise Program
Going on a diet is a cheerless activity under any circumstances. The least you
can do is give yourself a celestial head start. Here’s how:
 Once a year, there’s a New Moon in your sixth house of health. A New
Moon helps you usher in a new habit, so that’s a perfect time for begin-
ning a diet or exercise program (or both).
 A Full Moon in your sixth house can also be beneficial. It can help you
release an old habit — like compulsive eating or an addiction to 300-
calorie chai lattes.
 Saturn, the planet of self-discipline, can help you stick to a diet and
create new, healthier habits. Look for Saturn to form conjunctions,
trines, and sextiles with the Sun and the Moon.
 Saturn also supports your efforts if it’s traveling through your sixth
house, your first house, or your Sun sign, even though any of these tran-
sits may correspond to difficult times in your life. The silver lining is that
they can also bring increased willpower, control, and accomplishment.
 Mars in the sixth house gives you a boost of energy — ideal for getting
to the gym and making it a habit.

Chapter 20: Ten (Plus One) Ways to Use Astrology in Your Life

Writing a Novel or Screenplay
I often work in the writers’ room of a private library, so I know how many
people are struggling with novels, screenplays, and other writing projects. I
see them all the time, shuffling their index cards, marking up their print-outs,
staring disconsolately at the screens of their laptops, or playing solitaire. I
sympathize. Writing projects are like diets: easy to begin and easy to put
aside. Here’s how to better your odds of completing your project:
 Begin a creative writing project when there’s a New Moon in your third
house; a New Moon in the fourth house (if you’re penning a memoir); a
New Moon in the fifth house (especially if you’re working on a screen-
play); a New Moon in the ninth house (of publication); or a New Moon
in Gemini.
 Begin when Mercury is direct. If Mercury happens to be in Gemini, in
Virgo, in your Sun sign, or in the same sign as your natal Mercury, that’s
a plus.
 Look for an active Uranus if you need to generate some original ideas; an
active Neptune when you want to stretch your imagination; and an
active Pluto when you’re ready to dig into emotionally complex material.
 Take advantage of Mercury’s retrograde periods by using them to revise.
Laying Low
You can only push so hard. Then, at a certain point, the universe pushes back
and you need to get some rest. For example:
 A New Moon or Full Moon in your twelfth house is a clear message that
you need to withdraw. The Sun’s annual monthly passage through that
sector of your chart is a wonderful time to schedule a retreat.
 It’s also wise to withdraw when the Moon is in the sign preceding your
own. Thus, if you’re a Scorpio, the Moon’s journey through Libra is a
time to pull back, to meditate, and to catch up on your sleep, content in
the knowledge that when the Moon enters Scorpio two or three days
later, you’ll receive a boost — and you’ll be fully rested and ready to
take advantage of it.
That’s what astrological timing is about. It isn’t about fate. It’s about using
the stars to maximum advantage.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Appendix
Planetary Tables
T
his appendix gives the location, by sign, of the Sun, the Moon, the plan-
ets, the Nodes of the Moon, and the asteroid Chiron between 1930 and
2012.
The tables list the day and time for every entrance (or ingress) into a new
sign for each of these celestial bodies. The tables are in the following order:
 Table A 1: The Sun
 Table A 2: The Moon
 Table A 3: The Nodes of the Moon
 Table A 4: Mercury
 Table A 5: Venus
 Table A 6: Mars
 Table A 7: Jupiter
 Table A 8: Saturn
 Table A 9: Uranus
 Table A 10: Neptune
 Table A 11: Pluto
 Table A 12: Chiron
The first column in each table tells you the sign the planet is entering. (The
Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book lists the symbol for each sign.) The
second column gives the date when the planet moves into that sign. The
third column shows the time when the shift takes place. Time is written in
military style, so 0:18 means 18 minutes after midnight, 16:09 is 4:09 in the
afternoon, and 23:57 is 11:57 at night. In some cases, the letter “R” follows the
time. This R stands for retrograde. It tells you that on that particular day, the
planet was retrograde. It doesn’t tell you when the planet went retrograde or
when it ceased to be retrograde and went direct. (See Chapter 18 for the ret-
rograde dates of Mercury, Venus, and Mars for the years 2007 to 2012.)

The tables in this appendix use eastern standard time. If you weren’t born in
eastern standard time, you have to make adjustments. Let’s say you were born
in Chicago. Since Illinois observes central standard time, Chicago is one hour
behind the East Coast — that is, it’s one hour earlier there. To account for that
difference, you have to subtract one hour from the times listed in the tables.
For example, Pluto swung into Sagittarius on January 17, 1995, at 4:16 in the
morning, EST. In Chicago, that momentous event occurred one hour earlier, at
3:16 a.m. In Denver, it was 2:16. In Los Angeles, it was 1:16. And so on.
The following is a partial list of the adjustments you have to make, depending
on where you were born:
If You Were Born In
Do This
Central standard time
Subtract 1 hour
Mountain standard time
Subtract 2 hours
Pacific standard time
Subtract 3 hours
Alaska standard time
Subtract 4 hours
Hawaii standard time
Subtract 5 hours
Most of Brazil and Argentina
Add 2 hours
British Isles and western Africa
Add 5 hours
Western Europe
Add 6 hours
Middle East, Norway, and South Africa
Add 7 hours
India
Add 101⁄2 hours
China
Add 13 hours
Australia
Add 12–15 hours
And don’t forget about daylight saving time. If it was in operation at the time
of your birth, or if you’re looking up the current position of the planets
during daylight saving time, you must subtract an additional hour. For many
years, daylight saving time began at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday in April and
ended at 2 a.m. on the last Sunday in October. That has changed. As of 2007,
DST extends from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in
November.
Note, too, that the tables in this appendix cover the years from 1930 to 2012 —
even when it doesn’t look that way. The Pluto Table (A 11) begins in 1937 with
the entrance of Pluto into Leo on October 7. Before that, Pluto was in the previ-
ous sign — Cancer. Similarly, the last entries for Pluto are in 2008. On January
25 it enters Capricorn. On June 14 it slips back into Sagittarius. (Notice the
R next to that entry, indicating that it’s retrograde on that day.) Finally, on
November 26 it reenters Capricorn, where it remains until well past 2012. No
further entries are required.
