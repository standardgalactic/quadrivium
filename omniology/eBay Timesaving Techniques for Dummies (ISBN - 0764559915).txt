About the Author
Marsha Collier spends most of her time on eBay. She loves buying and selling — she’s a
PowerSeller — as well as meeting eBay users from around the world. As columnist, author
of four best-selling books on eBay, television and radio expert, and lecturer, she shares her
knowledge of eBay with millions of online shoppers. Thousands of eBay fans also read
her monthly newsletter, Cool eBay Tools, to keep up with the changes on the site.
Out of college, Marsha worked in Fashion Advertising for the Miami Herald and then as
Special Projects Manager for the Los Angeles Daily News. Upon the birth of her daughter,
she founded a home-based advertising and marketing business. Her successful business,
the Collier Company, Inc., was featured by Entrepreneur magazine in 1985, and in 1990,
Marsha’s company received the Small Business of the Year award from her California
State Assemblyman and the Northridge Chamber of Commerce.
More than anything, Marsha loves a great deal. That’s what drew her to eBay in 1996,
and that’s what keeps her busy on the site now. She buys everything from light bulbs to
parts for her vintage Corvette to designer dresses. Marsha knows how to apply her busi-
ness acumen to eBay, and in this book, she shares that knowledge with you.


Dedication
To all the amazing eBay sellers and shoppers I’ve met over the years. Your questions
and dedication to eBay have spurred me on to research your queries and answer them
for you in my books. You inspire me to work harder and do my best to help all of you.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book was a challenge due to the many subjects I had to cover. Everyone who
worked on this book went over and above the call of duty to be sure we covered the
tips, secrets, and business-smarts needed to build a successful eBay business.
I must first thank my husband and daughter, who put up with my 7-day workweeks and
long hours at the computer while writing this book.
Then, of course, I thank the gang at Wiley. My publisher, Andy Cummings, without whose
continued personal and business support, I don’t think I could have ever succeeded. My
acquisitions editor, Steven Hayes, is tops. He’s a charming, intuitive, and humorous guy
with great ideas who holds my hand when things get squirrely and steps up to help me
in times of trouble. Steve pulls out all the stops when there’s a job to be done, and he
always goes the extra mile to make a project number one.
I was lucky enough to have some of the best at Wiley to put together this book. If you’re
ever lucky enough to work with this brilliant woman, Leah Cameron, you’ll know the
true meaning of commitment. Sharp as a tack, she’s always there to lend an ear or make
a comment that will enormously improve the project at hand. I also must thank the edi-
tors who worked with her: Kyle Looper and Nancy Stevenson. Without their help, we
might have gone crazy, and this book would have never made it to the printer on time.
Barry Childs-Helton is the bestest copy editor a writer could have. His command of the
language is immense, and his devotion to the project at hand is unswerving. Plus, he’s
really funny, and his edits bring a smile to my face at the most stressful of times.
Louise (eBay ID: aunt*patti) Ruby is still my friend (even after acting as tech editor for
three of my books). She takes my calls at all hours and snaps me back to reality when I
go off on some bizarre tangent. Louise’s devotion and knowledge of eBay really helped
me center my focus and helped make this book (what I consider to be) the best book for
advanced eBay sellers.

Introduction
T
hank you for taking the time to look over eBay Timesaving
Techniques For Dummies, my latest For Dummies book about eBay.
This book is loaded with advanced tricks, effective methods, and
clever tidbits of information aimed at helping you take better advantage
of your time and potential on eBay. When you started out on eBay, you
may have had the inkling that perhaps you could actually earn a living on
the site. Then reality set in, and you recognized how all the facets of buy-
ing and selling on eBay take a bit more work than you previously
expected. Of course they do!
Remember, an eBay business is e-commerce. Many people who start sell-
ing on eBay with the idea of creating a successful home-based business
have no background in running their own business — and no background
in retailing. Understanding how a business works takes some study and
practice (some people even spend four years at college to learn about
running a business). So don’t be disappointed if (at first) all your eBay
activities don’t just fall into place. There’s a definite learning curve, and
that’s why I write my books. I pull from my years of marketing and adver-
tising work and my current full-time occupation — writing and teaching
about eBay — to offer insights and help you through the rough spots.
By buying this book, you’ve invested two things I truly respect: your
money and your time. In return, this book gives you lots of information
for your money, and the time you spend reading it and putting this infor-
mation into practice will be invaluable.
Saving Time with This Book
There are over 100 million registered eBay users. Luckily for us, the
majority of them are buyers. But there are a growing number of sellers,
too. The simple fact is, to be a success on eBay, you need to know more
than the competition.
My entry into the Timesaving Techniques For Dummies series focuses on
some high-payoff eBay techniques that save you time, either on the spot

Introduction

on eBay, and know how to use the site to your
advantage; but there are still certain things that
escape you. I’ve unearthed some of those unknown
features for you in this book.
Everyone out there — especially eBay — has some
advice on how to best sell on eBay. I assume you’ve
seen past some of the propaganda and want to
quickly weed through the rest to find out what’s best
for you.
I also assume you want to know some solid retailing
and marketing techniques for your business. I’ve
made a point to put those in this book, too.
From what I’ve heard from the eBay community,
you’re probably comfortable with the site, but want
to make more of it. That’s the basis of this book.
Making more of eBay without wasting time and
money.
What’s in This Book
To save time, this book is separated into techniques.
(This really confused me at first — since I’m used to
writing full-on chapters.) A technique tackles just
one subject and lays it out succinctly and swiftly. It’s
a way to get your answer quickly, without a lot of
extraneous information — or too many of my edito-
rial comments. (Hey, focus is good, too!)
Some of the techniques go into advanced ideas
about selling on eBay. If they’re not relevant for the
work you do now, just skip ’em and come back when
you need those nuggets later.
This book follows in the tradition of the Timesaving
Techniques series. There are lots of visual cues that
make it easier for you to enter a technique at the
placing giving the information you need. No need to
read this book cover to cover — jump in wherever
you see something interesting. It just may answer a
question you’ve had for a while.
or somewhere down the road. I’ve written this book
so you can get to the meat of the subject in a hurry,
with step-by-step instructions when necessary, with-
out the fluff (or sales pitches) you don’t want.
I’ve identified more than 60 techniques that eBay
users need to know to make the most of their time.
Many of the ideas may be new to you, but they all
will help your business take care of its bottom line.
Decide for yourself how to use this book: Read it
cover to cover if you like or skip right to the tech-
niques that interest you the most.
In eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, you
find out how to:

Take your eBay business up a notch. Discover
how top online retailers know what goods to buy
for resale and when to buy them. I’ve included in
these pages the straight goods — the informa-
tion that all those get-rich-quick e-mails claim to
give you — except here you get the real facts.
Check the techniques that will help you cus-
tomize these theories for your own mercantile
transactions.

Customize your eBay business to suit you.
Learn about the third-party tools that can work
as an adjunct to the best (I’ll let you know which
ones) of the excellent tools that eBay supplies.

Tame time-draining tedious tasks: I try to
demystify the inner workings of running an 
e-business and let you in on more than 60 tips
and tricks along the way. When you’ve got a han-
dle on the tedious tasks, you can spend more
time creating great results and less time fiddling
with a feature to make it work correctly.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume you’ve been trading on eBay for a while.
You may be selling on eBay part time and feel that
you’ve become successful enough to take your busi-
ness up a notch. Perhaps you are running a business

What’s in This Book
3
When I come to an idea that cross-references
another, I’ll give you a technique number to flip to
and check out if you want. Also, if an idea comes to
you while reading, check out the index in the back of
the book. It helps you zoom directly to your ques-
tion’s answer.
Part I: Buying for Successful Selling
I know you’re going to love this part. Aside from
refreshing you about the updated nuances of buying
product on eBay, I bring you the straight truth on
sourcing merchandise for your eBay auctions. Read
this part, and you’ll have the information you need
to be buying at wholesale and below. After you put
this information into play for your business, you’ll
be hip to those hokey “wholesale list” e-books and
other gimmicks — and harder for them to tempt!
I’ve also included some information on saving your-
self from buyers who waste your time. Everyone
seems out to protect the buyer — and that’s fine —
but here’s where I show you how to protect yourself
as seller, too!
Part II: Selling Shortcuts
In the Selling Shortcuts part, you get more informa-
tion from the brick-and-mortar retail world to adapt
to your eBay auctions. I show you how the pros set
their product price points, as well as how to make
your shipping expense into a profitable cost center
(rather than the losing proposition that it often is).
You’re also going to get the scoop on what I call the
eBay seller’s “killer app,” Sellathon. Never before
have eBay sellers had access to the type of informa-
tion this program supplies — used with some savvy,
this product can help all sellers improve the bottom
line.
I also show you how to use some handy eBay tools —
such as Turbo Lister — that offer an effective, inex-
pensive help with organizing sales.
Part III: Prettying Up Your Auctions
Here it is — in-depth discussion of photographing
the goods for eBay and handling your own image
hosting. I take you step-by-step through professional
(but doable) photography methods for getting qual-
ity images. You also get an HTML tutorial that
answers your questions about setting up your list-
ings to foster good, clean, high-bidding auctions.
With the techniques in this part, you find out how to
save a mound of money by setting up attractive item
pages yourself and not having to pay for “services”
at every turn.
Part IV: Finishing Off Your Auctions
“Finishing off” sounds sort of morbid, but it’s what
auctions are all about. Think of this part as the place
where you find out the best ways of tying up loose
ends at the end of your transactions. Figure out
(finally) which mode of leaving feedback (who leaves
it first?) works the best.
Also, when transactions do go south, check out
Technique 27 and find out how to keep track of them
and get your appropriate credits from eBay.
Part V: Operating Efficiently with PayPal
PayPal’s got a lot more going for it than merely
accepting your payments for you. It has some truly
robust tools that can help you increase the bottom
line for your online business. This part explains the
tools and shows you the simple way to use them.
Before you leave this part, don’t forget to read the
technique about setting up your PayPal Shop. Its
free — so why not have another connection to your
online enterprise?
Part VI: Shipping Made Simple
Finally! I did buckets of research so you wouldn’t
have to. With this part, you’ll be ready to figure out

Introduction

Part IX: Acting Like a CEO
CEO? Who me? Yes, you. You are the Big Louie for
your eBay enterprise. Part IX has some great infor-
mation that you can hand over to your head of
marketing. Of course, that’s probably you, too — so
why not read this information on how to target your
audience?
If big business can apply marketing principles to
generating online sales, so can you. The information
is really going to be an eye-opener — it’s there to
make you think about your customers.
Also (finally), I’ve found a viable alternative to
escrow. Escrow’s reputation has taken quite a hit in
the media — that, plus you have to wait for your
money. Now there is a clean way to put your cus-
tomers at ease when you’re selling high-dollar items.
Part X: The Scary (or Fun) Stuff
Scary? Fun? I’m not sure which, but this part gives
you some good ideas that can help you expand your
business. Also, I go into depth on how to keep your
online security up to snuff.
Conventions Used in This Book
Conventions? Wow — funny hats, late cocktail par-
ties, free samples! I love conventions. But this isn’t
what the publisher has in mind (at least not yet).
Here conventions means the varied ways we’ve used
typefaces to make things stand out for you while you
read this book.

The online experience has lots of abbreviations:
GMS, NWT, URLs. If I come across an abbrevia-
tion you need to know, I give you the definition
and the abbreviation together. That way, if you
see the abbreviation again, you know what it
means.

To show you things you have to type, I put them
in boldface text. That way, you can type the com-
mands exactly as needed.
the best shipper for you. Discover the strengths and
weaknesses of UPS, FedEx, and the Postal Service.
I also give you the inside story on the hows and
whys of carrying your own package insurance for
your eBay shipments (the way the big guys do!).
When things go bad — you’ll still be ready. I’ve
checked out the claims process for all the major
shippers and here is where I let you know which
claims process involves the most hassle.
Part VII: Working the eBay Community
Okay, it’s a community. So what — what can it do for
you? In this part, I give you the lowdown on the com-
munity and some ways it can boost your bottom
line. For instance — how to make the most from
your eBay store (cross-promote your little heart
out!), and why you should keep up your reputation
as a Power Seller.
I also describe working with SquareTrade and show
you how to really become a Trading Assistant (with
suggested contract ideas).
Part VIII: Running an Efficient Back Office
Back office is what its all about. Here’s where I
explain the full-on information on running your own
business successfully. Business has certain stan-
dards, and in order for a business to succeed, you
need to follow the rules. (Just ask the tax man!)
Why reinvent the wheel? In this technique, you find
out the professional and easy way to handle your
bookkeeping and office feng shui. (Okay, maybe no
feng shui — at least not yet — but you will find out
some important things you need to do in your busi-
ness to protect the most important asset of your 
business — you.)
I’ve also included a technique to help those with dis-
ability issues. Many of these tips may help you even
if a disability isn’t an issue. (For example, enlarging
your screen after a long day’s work can sometimes
be a blessing for tired eyes!)

If I show you Web site or e-mail addresses,
they’re set in monospace text. For example, my

Icons Used in This Book
One thing I love about Dummies books is that
authors can use icons to draw your attention to
things the author wants to point out. I’ve noticed
that other recently published books on eBay have
incorporated the icon philosophy — but I want you
to know who started the standard — the Dummies
crew, laying it out for the smartest readers anywhere
(but you knew that, right?).
You’ll see the ones I use:
This is when my mind goes astray and there’s
something I really want you to know, but it
doesn’t fit into the text at that point. Think of
it as a little note from me.
When you see this icon, I’ve interjected an
idea that is something you need to keep in
mind while proceeding with the task at hand
or applying the technique down the road.
Yikes! When you see a Warning icon, know
that you’re treading in some delicate territory.
Many of the warnings represent situations that
can come back to bite you in the rear. Please
note the warnings and stay safe!
You see the little clock, when there’s a time-
saving tip at hand. It might represent a quicker
way to do something — or perhaps just a bet-
ter way. Heed the ticking clock!
Where to Go from Here
As you read each technique, I’d love for you to go
directly to the referenced resources on the Web and
give ’em a whirl. Of course, you may already know
about a lot of those — but they may be worth revisit-
ing to get some more ideas. Check out the links when
you find them in the book, and you may find some
up-to-date information.
I’d love to give you a super fast way to contact eBay,
but the site is so big and changes so fast, that’s not
practical yet. For now, this book gives you all the
links I know. If you have any better contacts, please
let me know.
You can reach me at my e-mail address, mcollier@
coolebaytools.com. Please realize that I’m a one-
woman-show and often the number of e-mails can be
overwhelming. I promise you that I’ll read every one
and will answer when I can. When lots of readers
have the same question, I will address it in my
newsletter, which you can sign up for on my Web
site, www.coolebaytools.com. (I promise you’ll never
get spam, and I will not sell or giveaway your e-mail
address to anyone.) It comes out about every 6
weeks — and I use the word about on purpose. But
hey, it’s free.
My publisher also has a very sharp Web site, www.
dummies.com. You’ll be able to visit the site and get
tips on all sorts of Dummies subjects, including tips
from me on eBay.
At this point, why not give Technique 1 a shot and
just start reading? If you have a particular question,
check the Table of Contents and visit the technique
that tickles your fancy. From there, just hop around.
Enjoy this book. I wrote it for you, and I hope it gives
you some new insights into running your eBay
business.


Part I
Buying for Successful
Selling

Efficient Searching
to Find the Best
Deals
D
o you have a friend who always seems to get incredible deals in
the brick-and-mortar world, as well as online? Or someone who
sells on eBay, buys most of his or her merchandise on eBay, and
resells it for a considerably higher price? You can bet that both your
friends know the ins and outs of working the eBay search system. This
technique shows how you, too, can master the art of finding the golden
nuggets on eBay.
Remember: When you’re looking to purchase an item, eBay isn’t always
your only option. (Check out Technique 2 for other worthwhile places to
search online.) But eBay’s search engine is a technological wonder. It can
search for your request in over 14 million auctions in a fraction of a sec-
ond. Using this technique, you can take advantage of this amazing feature
when you’re pricing your items.
Most search techniques given here also work with other search engines
on the Internet. For example, these methods can be extremely useful
for getting the most out of your searches through Google or Yahoo!.
Finding Deals with eBay Search
When bidding on an auction, anyone can easily be carried away with the
moment. Ego (or is it greed?) urges us not to be outbid by a few cents,
then by a quarter, fifty cents, a few dollars, and sometimes more! The bid-
ding war commences, the item sells for much more than it should, and
nobody really ends up a winner. So when you see an auction marching off
to the bidding war, you have alternatives to joining the fight. Before you
jump into the frantic bidding, consider using eBay Search to see how
many more of that item are for sale on the site. It’s never the last of its
breed to be on eBay. That is, unless the item is a high-dollar rarity, (in
which case, stop raising the bid by repeat bidding and read Technique 3
on sniping). There will always be another item like it — sooner or later.

• Figure 1-1: The Display option box on the Search 
results page.
• Figure 1-2: A completed item search on eBay, sorted by
lowest price first.
You can also perform a Completed Item
search directly from eBay’s Advanced Search
feature, which is accessible from the Search
tab in the Navigation bar.
Before placing your bids, be sure to set limits
on how much you will spend.
Taking the eBay price-comparison shortcut
Whether you’re looking to purchase a stock commod-
ity (an item that you could also buy in a retail store)
or a collectible, you can always benefit by doing
some research. First, try searching for your item on
eBay, as I did when I wanted to purchase a Hewlett-
Packard DVD recorder: Quite a few sellers on eBay
were selling my item. But before checking out spe-
cific sales (and sellers’ feedback ratings), I looked
into just how much my item sold for previously.
Follow these steps to quickly avail yourself of the
price-comparison options on eBay:
1.
Type your item description’s keywords in the
basic Search box that appears on most pages on
the eBay site and click Search.
For the best search results, be specific with
your item keywords. Because I also knew
which model of DVD recorder I was interested
in, I searched by typing the term HP DVD and
the model number, too.
2.
After eBay returns the current sales search
results, scroll down the page to find the options
boxes on the left.
3.
In the Display option box, as shown in Figure 1-1,
click the Completed Items link.
4.
Click the Price column heading in the resulting
list of completed items to sort the list by price.
To see the results as I wanted, I sorted the items
by price from low to high. (See Figure 1-2.)
The method described in this step list, is the
most efficient way to view pricing and avail-
ability information. While making your search,
you also get to see how many of the item are
currently for sale on eBay — a valuable added
piece of information when comparing prices.

Finding Deals with eBay Search
11
By knowing an item’s current high and low price on
eBay, you can estimate how much you’ll have to pay
when you buy. If you’re trying for an item in an auc-
tion, a quick Completed Item search can give you an
idea of how much to place in your proxy bid.
Always factor in the amount that the seller is
charging for shipping before bidding or buy-
ing! Many sellers charge large “handling” fees
disguised as shipping that can add beaucoups
bucks to the amount of your item.
Refining your search without 
missing important data
Using eBay’s search engine from the white-box 
page — a one-stop shop for searching that’s shown
in Figure 1-3 — is most efficient.
• Figure 1-3: The innocent-looking (but powerful) white
box for searching.
In the olden days of secretarial duties, secretaries
took dictation from their bosses. Because the secre-
taries couldn’t possibly write as fast as their bosses
spoke, they used a writing method called shorthand
to help them record the important points without
writing down every word. eBay’s search engine also
responds to a sort-of shorthand. To get the most out
of your white-box searches, use the tricks in Table
1-1 to shorten search time!

my favorite. Without clicking View Time Left, all
you’ll see is results with the date and time they

there is less than a minute left, there will be a
“less than” symbol and the number 1: <1.
Finding Your Item 
in eBay Stores
A little known fact about eBay is that when you
search the eBay site for an item, your search will not
extend to eBay Stores. Many eBay sellers have eBay
stores chock-full of merchandise that’s often cheaper
than the items you’ll find on the regular eBay site.
(The listing fees are considerably cheaper in the
You can type an auction number into any
search box on the white-box page and go
directly to the item’s page.
Once you get to the Search Results page (as I show
you in the preceding section) you have lots more
options to refine your search. The left side of the
Web page is chock-full of options — with these you
can define, redefine, and weed out your searches. I
recommend this approach so you don’t miss any-
thing. If you predefine your search at the beginning
(from eBay’s Advanced Search), you may miss some
desirable information that may not show up in your
“advanced” pre-defined parameters.
You have great tools to further define your search in
the Display option box, as pictured in Figure 1-1. To
narrow the search, click one of the links you find in
the Display options. Here’s what they all do:

Gifts View: Narrows your search to sellers who
have listed the item and paid eBay 25 cents for
the privilege of showing the Gifts View icon.
These sellers will guarantee to offer the options
of express shipping, card inclusion, gift wrapping
and/or shipping to a recipient other than the
buyer. (Note that many eBay sellers do this any-
way.) If you want a gift sent to someone else or
gift-wrapped — just e-mail the seller prior to bid-
ding. eBay sellers will more than likely help you
out; they can be a most accommodating crew.

Completed Items: Searches for items that have
sold in the past 14 days — giving you a history of
whether the item is very popular (How many
bids did it get? Did the item go unsold?), and at
what price it has sold for. (More about this spe-
cific search option in the preceding section.)

Gallery View: Shows you only the sellers who
have used a Gallery image to give you a better
look at their listings. You can also see the Gallery
pictures (if you don’t see them in your search)
by clicking the Show Picture link in the Picture
column next to the item title. This is a much
more efficient way to view Galley pictured items
among the other listings — you won’t miss out
on any of the other hundreds of deals from sell-
ers who don’t use the Gallery!

can go to eBay’s search page and search on the Stores
tab, as shown in Figure 1-4.

A quicker way to get to the stores is to use the white-

Saving Time with Favorite

eBay’s My eBay page has a tab called Favorite

can set the search — and the e-mail notifications — to
go on for as long as a year. I’ve been successful with
that option, especially when I’m looking for a rare
item that doesn’t show up on eBay regularly. Figure

in a word like aluminum, so this shortcut also finds

Gearing Up for
Savvy eBay Buying
W
hen we all initially joined eBay, it’s fair to say our main purpose
was to find great stuff at low, low prices. You know how to bid,
you say? You’re no dummy! (Or is that dummie?) Either way,
you’re not. But the buying process involves much more than merely plac-
ing bids on eBay. You’ll find a growing number of transaction types and
tools available when you want (or need) to buy something on eBay. By
the time you finish reading this technique, you’ll understand those per-
mutations and how to make the most of them.
Recognizing the Many Faces 
of eBay Transactions
eBay has grown into this massive mega-marketplace that even the best 
of eBay-expert buyers can find daunting from time to time. This section
looks at the available types of eBay transactions and gives you the goods
on how they work.
For any transaction type, you find the key information at the top of
each item page.
All bidding on eBay is based on the proxy system — if you’d like to
bid more than the minimum, eBay will hold you to your high bid,
outbidding anyone else who bids against you, until your high bid is
met (or until you win when the auction ends).
Scanning through traditional auctions
Single-item auctions are the mainstay of eBay; they’re also the easiest to
recognize. Looking at Figure 2-1, you can see that the current high bid is
listed at the top of the item’s information area. You can also see a button
to click if you want to place a bid. Simple. Although clicking the Place Bid
button at this point would be a bit preemptive (unless you’re putting in a
snipe — in which case, see Technique 3 for more on sniping techniques).

Recognizing the Many Faces of eBay Transactions
17
Before placing your bid, save yourself some time and
aggravation by scrolling down the item page to
study the description, shipping terms, and shipping
costs involved with the transaction.
• Figure 2-1: The auction information area.
Just below the Place Bid box, you can find the amount
of time left in the auction and (below that) how many
bids have been placed. This information helps you
evaluate the auction for how much time you have left
to do your research about the sale, and how strong
your competition is for winning the item.
At the bottom of the page, you see an area entitled
Ready to bid?, as in Figure 2-2. Now you can place
your bid by typing the highest amount you wish to
bid and clicking the Place Bid button. (In Technique 3,
I tell you about bidding strategies that can help you
win.)
• Figure 2-2: Placing a bid on an auction.
Homing in on Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions
Multiple Item (or Dutch) auctions offer more than one
of the same item in an auction-style format. Although
Dutch auctions seem to be a dying breed on eBay,
you occasionally still come across them while brows-
ing, and they can be a bit confusing. Normally you
see a quantity of available items (more than one), as
in Figure 2-3.
• Figure 2-3: A Dutch auction with 5 items up for auction.
Even an experienced buyer can find it hard to
tell Dutch auctions from Buy It Now, multiple-
item listings. The clue that identifies a listing as
Dutch: Look for a Starting Bid and the Place
Bid button. Multiple-item, single-sale listings
have only a Buy It Now button.
In a Dutch auction, bidding progresses just as in nor-
mal eBay auctions. You may bid on one or more of
the items available, and the highest bidders win
(based on the quantity bid for and won). The only
trick to this type of auction is that more than one
bidder can win — so all bidders win their items at
the lowest successful bid — not the highest!
Before bidding on a Dutch auction, click the
High Bidders link to see where the bidding
stands and how many of the items are cur-
rently bid upon. This way you can gauge how
much you want to bid. For Dutch-auction bid-
ding strategies, please read Technique 3.
To place a bid in a Multiple Item (Dutch) auction, fol-
low these steps:

• Figure 2-5: An eBay auction with the Buy It Now option.
If you don’t want to use the Buy It Now option and
you think you can get the item for a lower price (that
is, you hope no one else will see your chosen item),
you can place a bid and hope for the best.
The Ready to bid or buy? area for this type of sale 
is pictured in Figure 2-6. And this choice — bid or
buy — is truly an “or” proposition. As soon as any-
one chooses to bid in the auction (rather than using
Buy It Now), the Buy It Now option disappears for-
ever — and bidding proceeds as usual until the last
second of the auction.
• Figure 2-6: Ready to bid or buy? (shown in a Buy It Now
transaction).
Buy it quickly with Fixed Price sales
Buying on eBay offers yet another timesaving way to
get the goods you want. Items can be purchased
quickly and easily on the eBay site as Fixed Price
sales or directly in eBay Stores. You can easily recog-
nize these sales because they have no Place Bid
option. And you can quickly find these sales by using
the eBay search engine and following these steps:
1.
Scroll to the Ready To Bid area at the bottom of
the page, as shown in Figure 2-4.
2.
Type the amount you want to bid in the Your
Maximum Bid box.
3.
Type the number of items you want to bid on in
the Quantity box.
4.
Click the Place Bid button.
• Figure 2-4: Bidding on one or many items in a Multiple
Item (Dutch) auction.
After you place your bid, eBay shows you a confir-
mation page where you can verify that what you bid
on is what you want. Confirm your bid and you’re in
the fray.
With Multiple Item auctions, the trick is to keep the
winning price low. Find out how to do this with the
handy bidding strategies I describe in Technique 3.
Saving time at auctions with the 
Buy It Now option
Often you’ll come across auctions where the seller
offers a Buy It Now option, as shown in Figure 2-5.
By clicking the Buy It Now button, any inter-
ested party can close the sale at the listed Buy
It Now price and end the auction immediately.
Buy It Now is your fastest choice if you’re cer-
tain that you can’t live without the auctioned
item and you’re also okay with the price.

Paying Quickly and Seamlessly
through PayPal
Some people in the eBay world have actually accused
me of being a bit opinionated. Shocking — but, yeah,
okay, sometimes true regarding eBay practices where
I have experience. Certain ways of doing business on
eBay just work; others don’t. Why waste time and
money experimenting when I can give you the direc-
tion you need?
Bottom line: PayPal is the safest way for buyers to
pay for an eBay purchase — and it’s one of the most
economical ways for a business (the seller) to accept
credit cards. (See Part V for more information on
how PayPal can work for your business.)
Before you bid in an auction, always check the sellers’
payment options. If you’re comfortable sending a
money order to a mailbox somewhere, that’s your
business. But my advice is to always look to be sure
the seller accepts PayPal payments for eBay items.
Look for the PayPal logo under Payment methods
accepted (as in Figure 2-13) at the bottom of the item
description or at the bottom of the Seller Information
box.
• Figure 2-13: Payment Methods Accepted area of the 
item page.
Making eBay’s Shipping
Calculator Figure Your 
Shipping Costs
Since the cost of shipping items varies by the distance
between the buyer and the shipper, and by the weight
of the item, many savvy eBay sellers take advantage of
the eBay Shipping Calculator. As the buyer, you find
this tool toward the bottom of the item page, just
below the description and to the right of the Shipping
and payment details box, as pictured in Figure 2-11.
• Figure 2-11: The eBay Shipping Calculator on the 
item page.
To use the shipping calculator to quickly assess your
shipping costs for an item, follow these steps:

You can also find the PayPal Buyer Protection

Winning and paying
After you buy an item on eBay, either through Buy It
Now or by winning an auction, you see a button that
says Pay Now. Click the button, and you’ll be taken
to a review page.
If you aren’t on the item page, you can click the
word Pay that appears above the eBay naviga-
tion bar (its on every page of the site). Once
you click, you’ll see a list of items you won, and
by clicking Pay Now next to an item, you will
land at the Review Your Purchase page.
Figure 2-14 shows the review page. Here you can
make any adjustments to shipping if you’ve received
other information from the seller.
• Figure 2-14: Time to Review Your Purchase.
Paying for multiple wins from the same seller
The shortest route to pay for one or a multiple of
items is to go directly to the PayPal site, log in to
your account, and click the “eBay Items Won” link at
the top of your account summary. Figure 2-15 shows
you where to click.
• Figure 2-15: Handy Links on your PayPal account
summary page.
The next page presents you with a list of items you’ve
won on eBay. If you’ve purchased more than one item
from a seller, just click To Pay once. PayPal combines
all the purchases you’ve made from the seller and
presents you with an invoice (as in Figure 2-16). Just
verify the totals and follow the prompts.
If you have a balance in your PayPal account,
that amount will be immediately applied to
the payment. Be sure to withdraw your PayPal
balance first if you prefer to put your purchase
on a credit card. Also, the PayPal default is to
remove the balance due from your registered
checking account. Don’t just blast through this
part of the payment process; be sure your
payment is being paid using the method you
intend — and adjust the form accordingly.

Bidding to Win
T
he heart of eBay is the traditional auction (and the eBay enhanced
varieties). Bidding to win is the game, but often our dreams of
acquisitions fall at the very last few seconds of the listing. Someone
else has bid faster and higher. Winning at eBay can become an art form.
The highest bids always win, no matter when they’re placed, but we all
want to get that elusive bargain. That’s where the “art” part comes in.
I always feel as if I’ve achieved some great victory when I buy a popular
item on eBay considerably below retail. An even better triumph is when I
can buy something at below wholesale. That’s cause for celebration! There
is an art to this. Working at eBay as much as I do helps — I look for errors
made by sellers and misposted listings. I follow tried-and-true strategies.
That’s what this technique is all about. If you’re not getting the deals now,
the information put forth here will help guide your eBay Bargain shopping.
By the way, (insert shameless plug here) I recently wrote that book too —
eBay Bargain Shopping For Dummies, also published by Wiley.
One of the most popular strategies is sniping (described in the section
“Sniping Your Bids in the 21st Century”). Although sniping is a familiar
bidding strategy on eBay, it continues to evolve in practice. Do you think
you’re a master at sniping? I thought I was too. But with the advent of
sniping software and Web sites, casual sniping practices have become
passé. Read through this technique for ways to refine the fine art (sport?)
of sniping. And while you’re here, discover other helpful bidding strate-
gies as well.
Sniping Your Bids in the 21st Century
Sniping, the elegant art of bidding at the last possible second, has been a
favorite way for buyers to get great deals on eBay since the site began.
Subsequent technological progress made it harder for the dialup user to
snipe. That is, an eBay member with a high-speed connection had a dis-
tinct advantage — unless the dialup user’s bid was very high.

• Figure 3-2: A close call, multiple-sniping win — boy, was
my heart pumping!
Of course, the best way to win an auction
without straining your nerves is to place your
snipe at the highest amount you’d be comfort-
able paying so you outbid all comers except
maybe your local billionaire.
Sniping with an online service
Surprisingly (or not), some people just can’t sit
around twiddling their thumbs at their computers,
waiting for an auction to close. To the rescue come
online sniping services that place your snipe bids for
you when you’re otherwise engaged. You can even
find sniping software that runs from your computer.
Here’s a word (or two) of warning about using
sniping software. You must leave your com-
puter online for sniping software to work, but
leaving your computer online while you’re
away can leave it vulnerable to hackers. Be
sure that you have security measures (such as
a secure firewall) in place if you decide to use
sniping software.
Most folks would rather not leave their computers
humming along gaily waiting to place a snipe. They
prefer to shut down their home systems for the night,
and restart them the next morning. Makes sense — if
the kids or the better half should happen to monkey
around with your stuff just because they walk by and
see a computer on and waiting, bidding disaster could
occur. The better solution (for the more security con-
scious) is an online sniping service.
Sniping by hand — the 3-window way
Manual sniping means zeroing in on your item dur-
ing the last few minutes of the auction. Take a look at
Figure 3-1: I have two small windows open on an
item I’m interested in. I constantly click Refresh on
the item page to catch any last-minute bidding.
• Figure 3-1: Basic sniping in action.
I’ve checked out how fast my pages can reload, so I
know how many seconds I can shave off my bidding —
and I have my bid prepared in the second window. (To
open a new window with your selected item, press
Ctrl+N on your keyboard.) During the final minutes of
the auction, I repeatedly refresh the main item page to
see how many seconds are left to bid. When the very
last second — the final bidding moment — appears, I
switch to the smaller bidding page and click the
Submit button.
What happens if a sniper swoops in and outbids you
at the same second? Have a third bidding window
(Ctrl+N again) open, ready to submit a prepared
higher bid! Often I’ve used this three-window plan to
outbid even some sniping services. Check out the
times the bids were placed in the bidding results in
Figure 3-2. (That auction closed at 20:55:26.)

Bidding to Win at Traditional Auctions
25
Two very popular online services among eBay users —
BidRobot and eSnipe — accomplish the same thing
(placing your last-minute bids), but charge differently
for his or her services:

BidRobot.com offers an all-you-can-eat fee struc-
ture for your bidding pleasure. I like this one
because, when I’m in the mood to shop, I can
cast out perhaps 40 snipes at a time. Granted, I
pray I get outbid on some; if I won them all, I’d
blow my budget! Luckily, I usually win only a few.
The fees are based on membership time. If you’re
just doing some serious shopping, you can pur-
chase 3 weeks’ worth of all the snipes you can
place for $3.95. A full year costs only $34.95 — no
matter how many items you win.

eSnipe.com bidding is simple, too, and the com-
pany has a unique way of placing your snipes. Not
only can you place them from the eSnipe Web site,
you can install a small program called SnipeIt! that
becomes part of your Internet browser toolbar.
When you find an auction that you’d like to snipe,
just click the SnipeIt! button — you’re logged in to
the eSnipe service, and your snipe will be placed
on their system automatically.
eSnipe’s fees are based on the final value of eBay
winnings secured by the site for you. You pay 1
percent of the winning auction price as your fee
for using the service (a minimum of 25 cents per
item and a maximum of $10.00). Dutch-auction
wins of any quantity are charged $1.00 each. You
pay ahead of your snipes with BidPoints (the
eSnipe currency) and can buy as little as 500
BidPoints ($5.00 worth) at a time.
Bidding to Win at Traditional
Auctions
All bidding on eBay is done in standard increments
(Table 3-1 shows how the bidding increases). An
excellent way to beat the system and win more auc-
tions is to place your proxy bids with added, almost-
random amounts that fall somewhere between the
standard eBay bid increments. For example, if you
put in a proxy bid for $15.58, and the competition
jumps in at the last moment with a bid of $15.50, you
win because you had a prior bid of eight cents more.
(See an example of this in Figure 3-3.)

If you snipe at the very last second, without any 
wiggle room to put in a second snipe, be sure to bid
high. If you have enough time, examine the current
high bidder’s bidding history (through eBay’s Bidder
search) — has this person bid on this item before?
For how much?
If you must bid early (without the help of any snip-
ing) be sure to bid high — no matter who snipes an
auction, the highest bid always wins.

Technique 3: Bidding to Win
26
• Figure 3-4: The savvy high bidder gets one item for the
underbidder’s price!
Before bidding on a Dutch auction, be sure to click
the link at the top of the page to see the Winning
Bidders list. Check out how many possible winners
are hovering around the low bid price and how many
are in the high area. To get the best chance of win-
ning, you’re usually safe if you place your bid around
the high-middle price — unless a sniper swoops up
the entire inventory in the last seconds of the auction.
Bidding to Win at Multiple
Item(Dutch) Auctions
In a Multiple Item (Dutch) auction, bidders can bid
on one or more of the items up for sale — and at the
end of the auction, all winners win their items for the
lowest successful bid price. So your primary goal for
winning Dutch-auction items is to place your bid just
right — so you’re not the highest bidder (raising the
final winning price to a ridiculous amount) — and
not the lowest bidder (it’s way too easy to be shut
out by another bidder at the very last minute).
In Figure 3-4, you can see the results of a Dutch auc-
tion that had six items for sale: The high bidder won
five of the items at the lowest bid (in this case, $19.52).
If the high bidder had bid on all six items instead of
only one, it would have knocked out the lower price
and the winner would have to pay $20.02 apiece for all
six items.

Researching to Save
Time and Money
R
esearch. Boring, you say? Just want to get in there and buy? The
Internet — especially eBay — is a great place to buy things. But
responsible consumerism is just as important online as it is in
brick-and-mortar world — maybe even more so. As an enthusiastic par-
ticipant in online commerce, your twofold task is to

Know from whom you’re buying: Getting your goods from reputable,
reliable sellers is dually important: A professional seller (1) will strive
to give you good service, and (2) is more than likely to be selling qual-
ity goods. Either way, they don’t want to ruin their reputations by dis-
appointing a customer. A lot of hard work goes into building a good
reputation — why would they want to ruin it just to snag a couple of
extra dollars?

Know when you’re getting the best prices: In the mega-marketplace
that is eBay, you find all sorts of sellers selling similar items at differ-
ent prices, why not pay less for the same thing?
Especially when you’re buying items to resell or making purchases from a
drop-shipper (a seller from whom you order items to resell on eBay)
research helps ensure that you’re paying the lowest possible prices.
Many online sites may have items for sale that are as close to wholesale
as you can get — but you have to find them first.
The deals are out there, but doing research is how you sniff them out.
In this Technique, I show you how to use research to find a seller who’s
going to follow through with all the terms of the sale — and I spell out
how research helps you undercut the competition when it comes to find-
ing those gems just waiting to be unearthed.

A Quick Way to Evaluate
Feedback
In the Seller Information box, click the feedback
number next to the seller’s name. Above the result-
ing lengthy listings, you see two areas of informa-
tion: the Feedback Summary and the Recent Ratings
summary.
The Feedback Summary (as in Figure 4-2) sums up the
reviews that the feedback percentage is based on.
• Figure 4-2: The seller’s Feedback Summary.
Assessing the Seller 
Before You Shop
You can save a lot of time when you deal with a reli-
able seller. The grief and misery of waiting and wait-
ing for a slow-to-arrive package not only takes time
but also taxes your good humor. If the item arrives
“not as advertised,” you’re better off dealing with a
seller of good repute who cares enough to make it
right. Otherwise you may waste weeks (maybe
months) waiting for a resolution. A superior eBay 
e-tailer’s goal is to make the customers happy so they
return to buy more — and to preserve a positive feed-
back ranking to attract new customers. So even if
you’re bent on simplifying your bidding, you simply
shouldn’t bid on eBay without checking out the seller.
On planet eBay, checking the seller’s feedback
reviews is a definite must.
Finding out how the eBay feedback-and-reputation
system works is a real time saver. Staring at an auc-
tion or sale and scratching your head because you
don’t know jack about the seller can be a real waste
of time. Check out Table 4-1 for what to look for
when you quickly evaluate your seller.
Maybe not a “must” — but certainly a help —
is to see whether the seller is eligible to offer
PayPal’s additional Buyer Protection so your
purchase is fully protected. See Figure 4-1 for
the Seller’s Information box, and check out the
PayPal Protected logo at the bottom.
Examining the Seller’s Box
There’s a great deal of information in the eBay Seller
Information box, as pictured in Figure 4-1. This box
appears on every item page and is the condensed
version of the seller’s online business reputation.
But that’s all it is. Because this condensed version is
just a snapshot, it can also be misleading. That said,
I present Table 4-1 to reveal the handiest secrets of
the Seller Information box.

If the Feedback Summary shows more positive com-
ments than the total number that appears in the
feedback rating, it’s because the seller has had
repeat business. Good sign!
Only one comment from a unique eBay mem-
ber counts toward the feedback rating (by one
point in either direction), no matter how many
times a buyer and seller do business together.
Positive feedback comments count as a +1,
negative comments count as a –1 and neutral
comments are, well, neither here nor there (0).
On the case of two transactions between the
buyer and a seller, if one gleans a negative, and
the other is a positive, the two comments wash
each other out — not affecting the total at all.
Checking Out Current
Transactions in the Seller’s
Recent Ratings
The seller’s recent ratings, which appear to the right
of the Feedback Summary, give you a look at the
results of the seller’s feedback received over the last
six months. Since a leopard rarely changes its spots,
a seller with a high feedback rating will generally
stay that way. By checking out the ID Card (as in
Figure 4-3) with the calendar registered history, you
can easily see whether a seller has changed his
spots and gone over to the dark side by accumulat-
ing recent negative reviews.
• Figure 4-3: My eBay ID card.
Saving Time with Free
GutCheck™Software
I am also concerned with negative or positive feed-
backs to see whether others have purchased an 
item — and whether they like it. I use feedback as a
reference on the item I’m interested in as well. I click
through the item numbers on a seller’s past feed-
back to see whether others bought the item. Are pre-
vious buyers happy with his or her purchases? Or is
the price on this item so low because chimps put it
together with crazy glue?
Yeah, I get frustrated if I’m examining a high-volume
seller’s feedback comments and can’t find any nega-
tives. When a seller is listing thousands of auctions a
week, it really takes a while to trudge through the
hundreds of comments to even make it through 30
days’ worth. If only one or two negative feedbacks
show up among hundreds of positives, odds are I’ll
have no problem with the seller.
To solve my problem of finding the negatives, I found
wonderful free software from the people at www.team
redline.com. They developed GutCheck™software as
a service to the eBay buying and selling community.
Quick to download and install, GutCheck resides
within Internet Explorer and is available from a pop-
up menu (which you call up by right-clicking in any
Internet Explorer window). Follow these steps to
have GutCheck sniff out negative feedback reviews:
1.
Right-click any eBay member’s name or feed-
back link.
2.
Choose Get GutCheck from the resulting pop-
up menu, as shown in Figure 4-4.
3.
Sit and wait while GutCheck automatically
scans through all feedback posted for the
seller.
The software allows you to stop the scan at any
time with a click of the mouse. That means you
can limit your examination to a range of feedback
comments. When a seller has thousands, I often

If you’ve found the negative you’re looking for,
scroll the program to the sight to see the item

To see only the negatives and neutrals that
have been left for the seller, just click the box
that says Negatives and Neutrals only to see
these comments on their own, as in Figure 4-6.
• Figure 4-6: Isolating the negatives and neutrals.
Conveniently, the program also picks up the seller’s
response to the feedback, which can give you a look
at what went wrong with the transaction. And there’s
a first-rate feature that allows you to exclude any
feedback left for the user by other users whose 
feedback rating is less than x (you can fill in the
amount — 5 is a good number). Inexperienced eBay
users are infamous for leaving spurious, unwar-
ranted feedback instead of contacting a seller to
legitimately sort out an issue.

manent record of such things. Best of all, the

Using a SquareTrade Seal for More Information
33
Using a SquareTrade Seal 
for More Information
Somewhat along the lines of the Good Housekeeping
seal of the 1950s and ’60s, eBay has set a standard
for sellers that works like a stamp of approval. The
SquareTrade seal shown in Figure 4-7 is posted on
qualified sellers’ eBay auctions. True, the seller must
subscribe to the service. But many vendors pay to
display such seals — including the Better Business
Bureau seal.
• Figure 4-7: My SquareTrade Seal.
Here are some good-to-know facts about the
SquareTrade seal:

A seller must apply for the seal, and SquareTrade
does some vigorous investigating. To be accepted
for the Seal, SquareTrade inspects the seller’s
contact information using various services,
including Equifax. For businesses, they also
require a business Dun and Bradstreet number
(or Federal ID number).

On a daily basis, every SquareTrade Seal mem-
ber’s eBay business is scanned to make sure
everybody’s performing in a professional man-
ner. That’s why all SquareTrade seals show the
current day’s date.
The SquareTrade seal states: “SquareTrade
cannot guarantee a transaction or seal mem-
ber’s performance, however SquareTrade’s
services can substantially lower the risks of
buying online.”

SquareTrade members also agree to respond to
any transaction disputes and to participate in
professional mediation through SquareTrade.
A SquareTrade seal also implies an even higher level
of fraud protection. SquareTrade’s Buyer Protection
Program, in addition to eBay’s Fraud Protection
Program, protects the sealholder’s auctions even
more. In most instances, SquareTrade provides $250
of protection beyond the $200 provided by eBay,
resulting in a total of $450 in coverage.
If available, the actual amount provided by
SquareTrade’s Buyer Protection Program is shown
on the Member Profile Page — accessible by clicking
the seller’s User ID link on the item-description page,
as shown in Figure 4-8. Not all listings necessarily
offer the added protection, which limits a seller to
offer no more than $5,000 in total added buyer pro-
tection at any given time.
Doing business with SquareTrade seal members defi-
nitely saves you time and hassle because you have
reassurance that you’re dealing with a reliable vendor.
Check out Technique 56 for a way to actually
guarantee a seller’s performance.
• Figure 4-8: My SquareTrade Member Profile page.

Technique 4: Researching to Save Time and Money
34
Another favorite is pricegrabber.com. They search
the best online prices for everything from high-tech
stuff to baby buggies. After you’ve searched and
found sellers for your item on his or her site, you’re
prompted to type in your ZIP code. This is where
pricegrabber.com does its magic, calculating the
final sale price for you — including shipping. No
more being sucked in by cheap product prices and
then getting walloped by huge shipping costs.
• Figure 4-10: PriceGrabber.com.
When searching for a bargain, I also check 
the Internet shopping sites like Google’s
froogle.com and Epinions’ shopping.com
for Internet comparisons. You never know
when you’ll find a cheaper price online.
Finding Discount Pricing 
on the Web
To find out whether a local brick-and-mortar dis-
counter is selling your selected item closer and
cheaper, I check a super-cool Internet site called
SalesCircular.com, shown in Figure 4-9. This Web
site compiles weekly newspaper-insert ads from
each state — researching such stores as Best Buy,
Circuit City, Kmart, CompUSA, Wal-Mart, and Staples.
No need to buy the Sunday newspaper just to
read the ads — you can go to the SalesCircular
site and find the deals. They also have a spe-
cial area to find items that are free after using
a rebate coupon. Not too shabby!

Real-World Sourcing
Strategies for Your
eBay Business
T
he single most-asked question I get, whether in person or in e-mail
is: “Where do I find merchandise to sell on eBay?” This, of course, is
followed by “What can I sell to make the most money on eBay?”
Good questions. But what successful seller has an answer they want to
just give to the competition?
As an eBay seller, you find yourself inundated with e-mail — as well as
auctions on eBay — offering wholesale source lists. These messages
guarantee that you’ll find items you can sell on eBay very lucratively. Yes,
but will they sell? More importantly, will they sell at a profit? Not every-
thing on eBay sells like hotcakes.
When profitable eBay PowerSellers have a good, solid source of merchan-
dise, they’re not likely to share the name of that source with anyone — nor
would any brick-and-mortar retailer. (Think about it a minute.) When I was
teaching a class for advanced sellers at eBay Live 2003 in Orlando, Florida, I
was asked the question in an auditorium-size room filled with PowerSellers.
I answered a question with a question: Were there were any PowerSellers in
the audience who would like to share their sources with the rest of the
group? You could have heard a pin drop. So I upped the ante — “I’ll pay any-
one $10 for one solid source” — still silence. Business is business.
The bottom line here is that all successful sellers tweak out their own
sources. What works for one may not work for another, many types of
financial transactions and personal relationships work for many different
vendors. Methods for finding goods that I include in this Technique are
gleaned from my own research, as well as from interviews with success-
ful online retailers.
Don’t make the liquidation mistake
I once also got an e-mail from a young couple planning to borrow money to pur-
chase a pallet of liquidation goods to start an eBay business. I immediately wrote
back to try to dissuade these young people. They had no idea of what liquidation
merchandise meant — and the challenges involved in making a profit with it. They
just thought they were buying a load of top-quality merchandise for pennies on the

Finding merchandise locally
Always remember that the cost of shipping the mer-
chandise to you adds a great deal of expense. The
higher your expense, the lower your return may be.
The more you buy locally to resell, the more profit
you can make.
The first place most potential retailers go is to their
local wholesale district. You can find yours in your
yellow pages (remember that giant brick of a book
they drop in your driveway once a year) under the
name of your item. For example, you want to sell
women’s apparel. Look up Women’s Apparel in the
yellow pages and find the subcategory of Wholesale,
as in Figure 5-1. Bingo! Immediate merchandise
sources, within driving distance of your home! Also
be sure to check the directories in neighboring com-
munities as well. The value of this printed (and usu-
ally overlooked) resource is immeasurable when
you’re starting up a business.
• Figure 5-1: A quick flip through the local phone directory
finds several wholesale sources for my
category of merchandise.
Newspaper auction listings
Another excellent source of merchandise for resale
is your daily newspaper — in particular, the listings
of major liquidation and estate auctions (usually on
dollar. Don’t make that mistake. If a deal seems too good, it
usually isn’t worth what you’re paying for it. (Be sure to read
Technique 6 for information on how to make informed deci-
sions about liquidation merchandise.)
Always exercise some caution (and a little
healthy skepticism) when someone sells (along
with his or her “wholesale” merchandise) tips
or newsletters on how to “get rich quick” or
“make big money” on eBay. Legitimate whole-
salers are there to move goods quickly from
their warehouses to retailers. Their business is
not to teach you how to “make it big” on eBay.
And before you stock up on anything, con-
sider this bit of wisdom from Danny Goodman
(the guy in charge of merchandise for Dodger
Stadium): When a vendor told him that an
item would “sell like hotcakes,” Danny replied,
“Hotcakes don’t sell at all in stadiums.”
Finding Out Where Stores 
Buy Their Merchandise
Okay, you want to set up shop on eBay. You kind of
know what type of merchandise you want to sell, but
you don’t know where to turn. Anyone in the brick-
and-mortar world who plans to open a new store
faces the same quandary: Find merchandise that will
sell quickly at a profit.
Merchandise that sits around doesn’t give you cash
flow — which is the name of the game in any busi-
ness. (Cash flow = profit = money to buy better, or
more, merchandise.) I spoke to several successful
retailers and they all gave me the same answers
about where they began their quest. The upcoming
sections give you a look at the answers these retail-
ers shared.
To gain access to legitimate wholesale sources,
you must be a licensed business in your city or
county. You also usually have to have a resale
permit and tax ID number from your state.

Saturday). Check out your daily newspaper each day
and look for this page or section.
You may want to sell women’s apparel, but if you can
get a great deal on office or pet supplies, paying
cents on the dollar, you just may bend your way of
thinking!
Don’t miss the daily classified section — look for ads
that announce local business liquidations. Do not 
confuse any of this with garage sales or flea-market
sales (run by individuals and often a great source for
one-of-a kind items). Liquidation or estate sales are
professionally run, usually by licensed liquidators or
auctioneers and involve merchandise that may be new
but is always sold in lots (in a quantity). Figure 5-2
shows a quick way to find some.
• Figure 5-2: A Google search for newspaper classified Los
Angeles brings up plenty of hits to peruse
online.
If your local newspaper has a Web site, use
their online search to view the classifieds for
major liquidations, estate auctions, or other
similar deals. Right there online, you can often
find just what you are looking for locally.
Regional merchandise marts
Your next stop, should you be lucky enough to live in
a regional area, is to find out if there is a merchandise
or fashion mart near you. These are giant complexes
that hold as many as several thousand lines of mer-
chandise in one area.
Merchandise marts are hubs for wholesale buyers,
distributors, manufacturers, and independent sales
representatives. They have showrooms within the
property for manufacturers or their representatives
to display their current merchandise. Under one
roof, you may find both fashion and gift merchandise
for your eBay business.
See Table 5-1 for a representative sprinkling of the
many marts across the country. Realize this is not a
comprehensive list, just one to get your mind mov-
ing. You can contact the individual marts for tenant
lists and more information. If you are a legitimate
business, they will be more than happy to teach you
the ropes and get you started.
My very favorite, the California Market Center (the
Web site pictured in Figure 5-3) even has a special
program for new buyers, offering tons of useful infor-
mation to help newbies get going.
• Figure 5-3: The California Market Center Web site.
When you go to each mart’s Web site, you
find hundreds of links to wholesale sources.
Many marts also send you a directory of the
manufacturers represented in the mart.

Wholesale trade shows
By checking out the links to the marts listed in Table
5-1, you’ll also end up with links to the thousands of
wholesale trade shows that go on across the country
each year.
Trade shows are commonly held in convention cen-
ters, hotels, and at the local merchandise marts.
When visiting a show or a mart, view all mer-
chandise before you place an order. Bring a
notebook with you to make copious notes of
items you find interesting and where you find
them.
These trade shows are gargantuan bourses of hun-
dreds of wholesale vendors all lined up and ready 
to take your orders. The vendors have samples of
the merchandise in the lines they carry, and are
delighted to answer all your questions about their

Necessary identification for 
trade shows and marts
When you attend one of the professional trade shows or
marts in the country, they want to be sure that you really
represent a business. These shows are not open to the gen-
eral public, and they want to keep it that way.
Below is a list of items that you may be asked to bring with
you as identification as a retailer. Check ahead of time with
the sponsoring organization for an exact list.

Business cards

A copy of your current Resale Tax Certificate or State
Tax Permit

Current Occupational or Business Tax License

Proof of a Business checking account or a Letter of
Credit from your bank (if applying for credit)

Financial Statement

Cash and checks
You may have to bring less than the items on this list. Be
sure to check with the organization sponsoring the trade
show or mart prior to attending so that you’ll have every-
thing you need. Don’t let this list scare you — wholesale
marts are fun and the organizers and vendors will do every-
thing they can to help you make your retailing venture a
success!
Very few trade shows are more exciting than the
Consumer Electronics Show (CES), sponsored by the
Consumer Electronics Association and shown in
Figure 5-4. If you buy breakthrough technologies to
sell online, this show is a must! You’ll find the latest
in everything high-tech including digital imaging,
electronic gaming, home electronics, car audio, home
theater, satellite systems and much, much more. It
takes days to see this show. You’ll see what’s new,
but more importantly, you’ll see what will be passé in
a hurry — great merchandise to sell on eBay!

Technique 5: Real-World Sourcing Strategies for Your eBay Business
40
The important thing is to find a wholesaler who
is familiar with (or better yet, specializes in) the
type of merchandise you want to sell. Obviously,
someone who specializes in prerecorded DVDs
and videos will not have a clue about the fashion
market and vice versa.
Don’t forget to check local wholesalers (as
described in “ Finding merchandise locally,”
earlier in this Technique) to find some good
sources.

Manufacturer’s reps: These are generally the type
of people you’ll meet at trade shows or marts.
They are the traditional Willy Loman kind of sales-
man, representing one or many non-competing
manufacturers and selling their merchandise to
retailers for a commission.

Jobbers or brokers: Jobbers and brokers are
independent businesspeople who buy merchan-
dise from anywhere they can at distressed
prices. They mostly deal in liquidation or salvage
merchandise. (Learn more about this source in
Technique 6.)
Don’t forget to negotiate. Almost everything in
the wholesale merchandise world is nego-
tiable. Although merchandise may have a set
price, you may be able to get a discount if you
offer to pay on delivery, or within ten days.
Ask whether your sources can help you out
with shipping costs (and perhaps promotions).
You just may get a discount if you promote
their products through banner ads. Ask, ask,
ask. The worst they can say is no.
See if the item is selling on eBay before you
make your purchase. Bring a laptop with a wire-
less connection (if there is a hot spot at the
show) or make notes for purchases on another
day. Getting a good deal is one thing — selling
it on eBay is another.
Figuring Out Who’s Who 
in the Industry
It would be very simple if you just bought merchan-
dise from a manufacturer. But that’s rarely the case.
A full team of players participate in the wholesale
game, and each player performs a different task. So
you’ll understand how to follow the plays without a
program, here’s a brief rundown:

Manufacturers. Buying directly from a manufac-
turer may get you great prices, but may not be a
place for a beginner to start. Manufacturers usu-
ally require large minimum orders from retailers.
Unless you have a group of other sellers (per-
haps a friend who owns a retail store?) to split
your order with, you may have to make your pur-
chase from a middleman.
An exception to the large-quantity requirement
may be in the apparel industry. Because apparel
has distinct, rapidly changing fashion seasons, 
a quick turnover in merchandise is a must.
Apparel manufacturers may allow you to make
small purchases towards the end-of-season to
outfit your eBay store. It never hurts to ask.

Wholesalers: Here’s your first step to finding
your “middleman.” Wholesalers purchase direct
from the manufacturer in large quantities. They
sell the merchandise to smaller retailers who
cannot take advantage of the discounts from
manufacturers for large orders.

Qualifying Your
Merchandise and
Methods
Y
ou’re likely to find various levels of quality when you look for mer-
chandise to resell on eBay. If you take time to evaluate the condition
of the merchandise you’re getting, you save time (and money) in the
long run. Receiving a box of ripped or stained goods when you expected
first-quality merchandise can be pretty disheartening. Know what the
industry language tells you about the quality of the merchandise you’re
looking to buy. And ask, ask, ask — about the condition of the merchan-
dise, that is. Before you put down your money for goods, qualify ’em.
In addition to qualifying the goods you buy, take the time to qualify the
processes and partners you use. For example, drop-shipping (shipping
goods straight from the stockpile to the consumer) is ever more popular
as a method to move the merchandise sold on eBay — but it comes with
many caveats. For example, eBay has a policy about pre-selling items, so
be sure to check it out — and make sure your drop-shipper has the mer-
chandise ready to go when you place your order. Read on to get the goods
on what to check out before you get the goods from a drop-shipper.
Use this technique to become a savvy buyer (of goods to resell) and an
effective mover (of those same goods). To help ensure that industry jargon
won’t trip you up, I outline the lingo you need to know and offer pointers
on making the right decisions about your merchandise and methods.
Know the Lingo of Merchandisers
Yes, you know that apparel is clothing, but did you know it’s also a whole
vocabulary? Here are some terms you’re likely to run across:

Job lots: The word job appears randomly throughout the wholesale
industry. A manufacturer may want to “job out” some merchandise
that’s off-season. In this use, a job lot simply refers to a bunch of mer-
chandise sold at once. The goods may consist of unusual sizes, odd
colors, or even some hideous stuff that wouldn’t blow out of your eBay
store if a hurricane came in. Some of the merchandise (usually no
more than 15 percent) may be damaged.

Technique 6: Qualifying Your Merchandise and Methods

• Figure 6-1: Access current industry classifieds on the
California Apparel News Web site.
You may be able to buy a single pallet or two from
a full load from a liquidator, but a single pallet is
even more of a gamble — you won’t have the
breadth of merchandise to amortize the damaged
goods that could be in the load. Check for any of
the following when dealing with these wares:
 This merchandise can be an assortment of liq-
uidations, store returns, salvage, closeouts,
shelf pulls, overstocks, and surplus goods.
 As much as 30 percent (if not more) of a
truckload may be totally useless.
 Some items may be damaged but repairable;
others may be perfectly saleable.
Buying liquidation merchandise is a gamble but can
have advantages. By buying a full truckload, you
have a wide breadth of merchandise, you’ll pay the
lowest amount for it, and some of it may be good for
spare parts.
Save yourself some money. Don’t go on eBay
and buy some wholesale “list” for $5. You can
get the same names by running a Google
search on the term wholesale.
A good way to find a jobber (someone who
wants to sell you job lots) on the Internet is to
run a Google search on wholesale jobber.
Another great place to find them is the phone
book or industry newsletter classifieds.
There are super discounts to be had on job 
lots — and if the lot contains brand names from
major stores, you may be able to make an excel-
lent profit.

Off-price lots: If you can get hold of top-quality,
brand-name items in off-price lots, you can do
very well on eBay. These items are end-of-season
overruns (they made more items then they could
sell through their normal retailers). You can gen-
erally find this merchandise toward the end of
the buying season.
Many eBay sellers, without having the thousands
of dollars to buy merchandise, make friends with
the salespeople at manufacturers’ outlet stores
(that’s where the merchandise may land first).
Others haunt places like TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, and
Burlington Coat Factory for first-rate deals.
Search genuine trade publications’ classified
ads for items to buy in bulk. Publications like
California Apparel News have classifieds that
are accessible online for a small fee. Visit their
Web site, shown in Figure 6-1, www.apparel
news.net and click classifieds. You can pay to
view current classified ads via PayPal, and as of
this writing, the cost is only $2.

Liquidations: All the eBay sellers think of liqui-
dations as the mother lode of deals. And, yes,
they may be the mother lode of deals if you can
afford to buy and store an entire truckload
(that’s an 18-wheeler’s container) of merchan-
dise. That takes a great deal of money and a
great deal of square footage. Not to mention the
staff to go through each and every piece.
You could end up with close to 50 pallets (the
wooden platforms that measure 4’ x 4’, stacked
as high) of merchandise from a liquidation 
purchase.

Staying Safe when Buying
Liquidations
Nobody offers a quality or fitness guarantee
when you buy liquidation merchandise. You
could end up with pallets of unsaleable mer-
chandise, and you must steer quickly away
from anyone who “guarantees” you’ll make
money.
Because all liquidation merchandise is sold “as-is,”
here are a few suggestions for dealing with the
uncertainties:

Get an anonymous free e-mail address from
Yahoo! before signing up for any “mailing lists” or
“newsletters.” Some Web sites that offer these
publications make most of their money by selling
your e-mail address to spammers. If you give
them an anonymous e-mail address, the buckets
of spam will never end up in your real mailbox. 
(I learned about that the hard way.)

Raise your shields. If the “wholesalers” also link
their Web sites to miscellaneous make-big-profits-
at-eBay Web sites, beware. They may be making
most of their money from commissions when the
e-book of “road-to-riches” secret tips is sold
to you.

Be sure there is a phone number on the site.
Give them a call and see how you’re treated. It’s
no guarantee of how they’ll treat you if you’re
unhappy with a purchase, but you may get a
human being on the phone (rare and precious
these days).

Look for a physical address. Do they have a
place of business or is the company running out
of some guy’s pocket cell phone? (Often it’s not a
good sign if there’s no place to hang a sign.)

Ask for references. Seeing the Better Business
Bureau Online, TrustE, or SquareTrade logo on
the Web site can bolster trust in the company.
(They actually have to qualify for those seals.)

Before you purchase anything, go to eBay and
see whether that item will sell — and for how
much. Use the searching approach discussed in
Technique 1. Often you find hundreds of listings
for an item with no bids. Check completed auc-
tions and be sure that the item is selling for a
solid profit over what you expect to pay for it
(including shipping).

Never buy anything just because it’s cheap.
That was true in Thomas Jefferson’s day and it’s
still true today. Be sure you can actually sell the
merchandise. (I also learned this the hard way.)

Look for the word FOB. That means freight on
board. You will be charged freight from the loca-
tion of the merchandise to your door. The shorter
the distance, the cheaper your freight costs.
Before doing business on any Web site, be
sure its owners have a Privacy Policy that pro-
tects your personal information. Also check for
an About Us page. Be sure the About Us page
really talks about the business and the people
behind it. I hate to be repetitive, but be sure
you can reach a human being on a phone or
in person (with a street address) if need be.
Internet Shopping for 
Resale Merchandise
I’ve come across many legitimate sources of goods
on the Internet. There are some really good ones.
But as I mentioned in the preceding section, the
Internet is loaded with scam artists; it’s up to you to
check vendors out for yourself before spending your
hard-earned money. Even if I mention sellers here, I
want you to check them out as if you knew nothing
about them. I cannot guarantee a thing; all I know is
that at the time of writing, they were reliable sources
for eBay merchandise.

Technique 6: Qualifying Your Merchandise and Methods
44
Wholesale Central
One of the largest sites of wholesalers on the Inter-
net is Wholesalecentral.com. You’ll find everything
from women’s apparel to flea market items — all
with their own clickable links and phone numbers.
The site is the brainchild of Sumner publications.
They have a linked online directory of thousands of
wholesale sources selling all types of merchandise.
They also publish a monthly magazine called Web
Wholesaler.
Poke around their pages and check out the ads.
Often some good wholesalers offer free shipping on
your first order or give you some other introductory
discount.
Big Lots Wholesale
If you’re familiar with the Big Lots stores scattered
around the country, then you have an idea of what
you can buy at biglotswholesale.com. A quick click
to their Web site showed me they were loaded with
great deals on everything from health and beauty
items to toys to lawn and garden tools!
Sites like Big Lots Wholesale change merchan-
dise quickly, so when you find something that
piques your interest, research it quickly and buy
it. It may not be there when you check back.
Authentic European designer goods 
from a source for eBay sellers
There are always lots of comments on the “authenticity” of
the designer items that are sold on eBay. The bottom line is
that if you sell authentic, brand-name luxury items on eBay,
the items generally sell for good (read: high) prices. If your
item is counterfeit, eBay’s VERO trademark police will end
your auction or sale.
You must have a Federal Tax ID number
(that’s your identification to do business) to
even register on many wholesale sites. Finding
wholesale Web sites with this restriction is a
good thing. It’s another way to verify that
you’re the dealing with a legitimate supplier.
Liquidation.com
If you like auctions (and I know you do), check out
Liquidation.com. This is a massive all-auction Web
site that has incredible deals on all types of mer-
chandise. Figure 6-2 gives you a look at some of the
auctions I found with a click from their home page.
• Figure 6-2: The Liquidation.com Web site.
One of the things that I love about this site is that
when inspecting the individual auctions, many auc-
tioneers provide a link to the manifest — a list of
every piece of merchandise in the lot. If you click the
word Manifest at the top of the auction page, you see
an exact, piece-by-piece list of the items included in
the lot you’re bidding on.
Liquidation.com also has a shipping calculator to
help you know ahead of time how much your ship-
ping may be.

Dealing with Drop-Shippers
45
The VERO team does an excellent job of removing bogus
items from the site, when and if the manufacturer reports
the listing. For example, the publisher of this book, Wiley
Publishing, Inc., is very protective of the For Dummies brand
and the company is a member of VERO.
Purchasing designer goods from the manufacturers is a rar-
ity. Somehow Burberry or Gucci aren’t the least bit inter-
ested in the piddly $1,000 I might scrape together to invest
in their merchandise. But if you’re looking for a legitimate
wholesaler of authentic designer goods that sells surplus
designer goods in small lots for individual resale on eBay,
such a creature does exist: Luxury Brands, LLC has worked
out this unique niche in the market. You can find its Web
site at www.luxurybrandsllc.com
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
The second-most-asked question I get wants the low-
down on drop-shippers. A drop-shipper is a business
that stocks merchandise and sells it to you (the
reseller) — but ships the merchandise directly to
your customer.
By using a drop-shipper, you transfer the risks of
buying merchandise, shipping it, and storing it to
another party. You become a stockless retailer with
no inventory hanging around — often an economi-
cal, cost-effective way to do business.
The following steps outline the standard way to
work with most drop-shippers via eBay:
1.
Sign up on the drop-shipper’s Web site to sell
their merchandise on eBay or in your Web
store.
Be sure you’ve checked out their terms before
you sign up — to be sure there’s no minimum
purchase upon signing up.
2.
Select the items from their inventory that you
wish to sell.
For this example, say the item you select costs
$6.99. The supplier gives you descriptive copy and
photographs to help make your sales job easier.
3.
Post the item online and wait (fidgeting with
anticipation) for someone to buy it.
By the way, you’ll be selling this item for $19.99
plus shipping.
4.
As soon as your buyer pays for the item, e-mail
the drop-shipper (or fill out a special secure
form on their Web site) and pay for the item
with your credit card or PayPal.
5.
Relax while the drop-shipper ships the item to
your customer for you.
6.
If all goes well, the item arrives quickly and
safely.
You make a profit and get some positive feedback.
The drop-shipper’s Web site provides you with
descriptions and images. Fine. But you and
everybody else who sells that item on eBay will
have the same photos and descriptive copy. Do
yourself a favor and get a sample of your item,
take your own pictures, and write your own
description. Then at least you have a chance at
beating the competitive “sameness” on eBay.
Drop-shipping works especially well for Web-based
retail operations. Web stores can link directly to the
drop-shipper to transmit shipping and payment
information. When you’re selling on eBay, it’s
another thing. There’s more competition and you
can’t list hundreds of items at no additional cost.
Listing items on eBay costs money and may build up
your expenses before you make a profit. (For a com-
plete discussion of fees, go to Technique 9.) You can’t
just select an item from a drop-shipper and throw
hundreds of auctions on eBay without loosing money.
That is, unless your item is selling like gangbusters at
an enormous profit. If that were the case, believe me
there would be another eBay seller buying direct from
the manufacturer and undercutting your price.

Technique 6: Qualifying Your Merchandise and Methods
46
Consider the following when you’re choosing drop-
shippers to work with:

Skepticism is healthy. When you come across
Web sites that proclaim that they can drop-ship
thousands of different products for you, think
twice. Thousands? I don’t know many stores that
carry “thousands” of items — if they do, they have
vast square footage for storage and hundreds of
thousands of dollars to invest in merchandise.
Most drop-shipping services don’t. A much
smaller offering of merchandise may indicate that
indeed the drop-shipper has the merchandise
ready to ship and isn’t relying on ordering it from
someone for you.

Look out for long lines of distribution. Drop-
shippers are often middlemen who broker mer-
chandise from several different sources — for
example, from other middlemen who buy from
brokers (who in turn buy from manufacturers).
The line of distribution can get even longer —
which means that a whole slew of people are
making a profit from your item before you even
buy it “wholesale.” If even one other reseller gets
the product directly from the distributor or
(heaven forbid) the manufacturer, that competi-
tor can easily beat your target selling price and
make (what should have been) your profit. Verify
with the drop-shipper that they stock the mer-
chandise they sell.
Many wholesalers will perform drop-shipping for you. 
When you find a drop-shipper who is also
a wholesaler (or vise versa), look for one who
has a good professional track record. Look
for experienced buyers who get in a lot of
good merchandise, and can handle pro-level
business concerns such as resale permits and
sales-tax numbers.
eBay cutthroat competition
eBay is an extremely competitive, sometimes even cutthroat,
marketplace. I recently was in a price war with another eBay
seller selling the same item. To compete with me, he cut his
price below mine. Then I undercut his price, he undercut
me, and profit started to nose-dive.
In this stomach-turning situation, I realized that the other
seller was selling drop-shipped goods and had to include
hefty ground shipping fees. Immediately, I matched his
price and offered free shipping! I had more flexibility in my
pricing because I bought the item from the manufacturer
in a lot of 12 units.
I switched my product shipping from Priority Mail to FedEx
Ground and came out a winner. (I still offered Priority Mail
shipping at an additional charge.)
It’s one thing to sign up for a free newsletter —
or even to register with a particular site — but
it’s something else to have to pay to see what
the drop-shipper intends to offer you. You
should not pay anything in advance to sign
up for a drop-shipping service.
Finding a good drop-shipper
Thousands of Web companies are aching to help
you set up your online business. While some of
them are good solid companies with legitimate back-
grounds, others are out there just trying to get your
money. These guys hope you don’t know what
you’re doing; they’re betting you’ll be desperate
enough to send them some cash to help you get
your share of the (har-har) “millions to be made
online.”

Dealing with Drop-Shippers
47
Coping with the inevitable “out-of-stock”
What happens when you sell an item and you go to
the distributor’s site and find it’s sold out? Before
your heart completely stops, call the drop-shipper.
Perhaps they still have one or two of your items
around their warehouse and took the item off the
Web site because they’re running too low on it
to guarantee delivery.
If that isn’t the case, you’re going to have to contact
your buyer and ’fess up that the item is currently out
of stock at your supplier. I suggest calling your cus-
tomers in this situation; they may not be as angry as
they might if you just e-mailed them. Offer to refund
their money immediately. Somebody else’s foul-up
may net you bad feedback, but that risk goes along
with using drop-shipping as a business practice.

Getting Action
When Transactions
Go Wrong
I
n the brick-and-mortar world, you go into a store, find your item, pay
for it, and take it home. Simple — or maybe not. You bring the item
home, try it out — and what if it doesn’t work? When you bring an item
back to a store, you may get a refund, get an exchange, be told to contact
the manufacturer (because that’s the only warranty), or have to watch
the sales clerk point to a sign that says, “All Sales Final.”
Let’s translate that sign: You’re stuck. Does it really pay to take your
chances and buy something clearly marked All Sales Final? Whether to take
the risk (especially online) is up to you, but it is a risk. Often eBay sellers
sell their All-Sales-Final items with a couple of loopholes. Make sure they
guarantee the item to be exactly as described. If it isn’t, odds are they’ll
refund your money and make things right if a problem occurs. Before you
buy anything online — before you even placing a bid on it on eBay or lock
in a Buy-It-Now — give the seller’s return policy a careful once-over.
Even if you protect yourself, there’s many a slip: Has your item not
arrived? Did it arrive broken? The world — especially the online world —
always falls short of complete safety. If you end up in trouble, this tech-
nique should get you some solid help.
Knowing Fraud When You See It
Here’s an obvious transaction trouble spot: You win the auction and pay
for your item, but the seller never sends your stuff. Or suppose the item
shows up but is totally different from the item you saw or read about
online. These situations constitute fraud, and laws exist to protect you
(the consumer) from fraud.
In particular, you’re protected from

Untimely shipping: Did you know that the Federal Trade Commission,
in their Prompt Delivery rules, says that your newly purchased item
must be shipped within 30 days of the close of the auction or sale? 
If it isn’t, the seller must have your permission to delay shipment 
further — or they must refund your money.

Yikes! You’ve Spotted the Fraud: What Now?
49

Failure to disclose complete and accurate infor-
mation: Also, according to the Federal Trade
Commission, the seller perpetrates a fraud by
failing to disclose all relevant information on an
item or by sending you an item that fails to
match the description used to sell it.
Find more information about your protection under
the law at www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/
intbalrt.htm.
Having the FTC watch your back against fraud
is great, but you can also actively participate in
your own protection. For example, does the
picture on eBay show your desired item from
only one side? If so, e-mail the seller and ask
for a view of all sides!
Meanwhile, beware of these other illegal scams that
go on in the eBay world . . .

Shill bidding: Confederates of a seller may place
ultrahigh bids on an item, thereby forcing you to
bid even more if you want the item. This forces
you to pay much more than you would in an hon-
est, open marketplace.

Bid siphoning: When you are bidding on a legiti-
mate item, an unscrupulous scammer sends you
an e-mail offering you the item at a lower price.
This usually comes along with a very legitimate-
sounding (or not) story about why they’re selling
this item so cheap. Don’t be greedy; the biggest
hogs get slaughtered. If you buy the item off-site,
you are not protected by any of the eBay fraud
protection policies.
Also, you may receive an e-mail from someone
other than the seller (from a different e-mail
address) in an item you won, asking for payment.

Bid shielding: A buyer places a very high bid on
an item, and at the very last possible moment,
retracts the bid and places another (lower) bid
under a different User ID. eBay policy fights this
cheat by not allowing retractions when only 12
hours remain in an auction, even if the item is
not bid up to the appropriate selling amount
before time runs out.

Online escrow fraud: The seller puts a high-
ticket item up for sale online at a very reasonable
price. To protect the buyer (they say), the buyer
“must” use a particular online escrow service.
After the dupe — guess who — makes the pur-
chase, the seller sends the buyer a link to the
“preferred” (fake) online escrow service. The
buyer sends the money, the seller keeps the
money and disappears, and the buyer never gets
the goods. Touch-and-go escrow services are a
growing problem; a scammer can set up a bogus
“escrow” Web site in a couple of hours and make
the whole thing look legit.
It’s safest to use eBay’s recommended www.
escrow.com for escrow transactions, or better
yet, read Technique 57 about a new alterna-
tive to escrow; bonding sales. Bonding can be
requested either by the seller or the buyer.

Money-wire fraud: Avoid transacting business
with a seller who requires you to wire money via
Western Union or other sources. The seller can
pick up the money anywhere and disappear. You
have no further way to find the seller.
Yikes! You’ve Spotted the
Fraud: What Now?
The first feeling that crops up when we know we’ve
been ripped off — right after outrage — is embar-
rassment. (Ack! How could I have been so stupid?)
Feeling foolish often triggers an urge to cover up the
blunder — just what the scammer is counting on. So
head ’em off at the outset: Take a little time to inves-
tigate the transaction before you buy. If you see a
possible violation shaping up before you get sucked
in, you do have a few places to turn to. You can stop
fraud before it occurs.

antennae — say, an auction that has lots of bids but

your bids instantly raised by another bidder, check
that bidder’s history, and find that person does the
same thing in other auctions but never wins.
The first thing you must do is report the item in ques-
tion to eBay. The sooner you report it, the better. If
the eBay security folks don’t receive notice till a few
minutes before the auction is over, they may not be
able to protect an eBay member caught in a scam.

6.
On the resulting e-mail form, type the item
number(s), the Seller’s User ID, the User IDs of
the suspected shill accounts, and a description
of your concerns.
By default, you receive a copy of the e-mail
report. If you do not want a copy, deselect the
check mark in the appropriate box.
7.
Click the Send E-mail button to file your report.
In addition to a copy of your e-mail report, you
receive another e-mail with a confirmation that
eBay will look into the issue, as in Figure 7-3.
• Figure 7-3: An e-mail acknowledgment from eBay that
they will investigate your report.
After you file your report and receive your confirma-
tion, don’t feel disheartened if eBay doesn’t contact
you with an update on the investigation. As the con-
firmation e-mail states, privacy reasons prevent
eBay from updating you. The only way you can be
sure that the bad-deed-doer was stopped is to revisit
the auction in a few hours.
If you revisit the problem item you reported
and the eBay listing police haven’t ended the
listing, it doesn’t mean the investigation is
over. As with most crime dramas: eBay has to
build a case before going full force after a sus-
pected fraudster.
Taking action if you feel you’ve been defrauded
Okay, you followed all the rules and paid for your
item with PayPal. But ten days have passed, and the
item hasn’t arrived. Bummer. Or you may have
received an item that the seller misrepresented sig-
nificantly in its item description. Also a bad scene.
When you win items on eBay, be sure to make
note of the day you send your payment.
Seven days after that, if the package hasn’t
arrived, contact your seller by clicking the Ask
the Seller a Question link on the item page.
Assuming you contacted the seller after a week, and
you got no response, it’s time to use the telephone.
To find the seller’s telephone number, follow these
steps:
1.
Choose Search➪Find Members from the eBay
navigation bar (at the top of every eBay page).
You’re now at the Find Members page.
2.
Scroll down to the Contact Info area.
3.
Type the User ID of the seller and the item
number of the transaction in the appropriate
text boxes.
You receive an e-mail message with the seller’s
telephone number. The seller also receives a
copy of the e-mail with your phone number.
Hopefully, once you place your phone call, any
problems can be worked out.

Follow the on-screen instructions to fill in the
details of the transaction.
SquareTrade then takes over to contact the seller
about your claim and direct you both to a secure,
password protected Direct Negotiation area.
The negations will be transacted over a Web-based
communications tool. All discussion will transact
over a secure Case Page, accessible by only you and
the seller.
If you get nowhere with SquareTrade, it’s time to file
the eBay Fraud Alert.
Time is money here. You must file your eBay
Fraud alert and/or your PayPal Buyer Protection
claim within 30 days of the transaction. Keep
watching the clock as you try to get help! After
30 days, no one from eBay or PayPal will help
you; you’ll have to go to the state and federal
government. No refunds likely there.
eBay’s Buyer Protection Program
Every transaction completed through the eBay site is covered
by the eBay Buyer Protection Program. You are covered for
losses resulting from non-delivery or misrepresentation of the
item for up to $200, minus $25 (eBay calls it a processing
cost). If your item was under $25, you do not qualify for a
reimbursement under the plan.
If the phone number you receive is someone
else’s number or is disconnected, immediately
report the situation to eBay using the Contact
Us form, as described in the section “Reporting
questionable items on eBay,” earlier in this
technique. Select Ask about bidding or buying
in Box 1, Problems with sellers in Box 2, and
Seller’s e-mail or contact information is not
working in Box 3.
If you get nowhere after a discussion with the seller,
and the seller has a good feedback rating to preserve,
you can try a last-ditch effort with SquareTrade.
When you go to the SquareTrade Web site at www.
squaretrade.com, you arrive at a free online dispute
service, as in Figure 7-4.
• Figure 7-4: The SquareTrade Web site.
To initiate a dispute resolution, follow these steps:
1.
Click the Click here link indicated for eBay
Buyers and Sellers involved in a dispute.
This link takes you to the Online Dispute
Resolution (ODR) hub page.
2.

Trouble with a Purchase or Sales, as shown in
Figure 7-5.
You’re transferred to a secure connection to file
your case.

Filing a Claim with PayPal
53
If you’ve paid for the item via PayPal, you may be addition-
ally covered for up to $500. Immediately go to PayPal and
file a claim under their Buyer Protection Program (as
described in the section “Filing a Claim with PayPal,” later in
this technique).
If you didn’t pay through PayPal, but paid directly through a
credit card, contact your credit card company without delay.
Most credit card companies offer 100% online protection.
If you paid with a money order or check, follow the upcom-
ing instructions for filing a Fraud Alert with eBay.
Filing a Fraud-Protection
Claim with eBay
The first step in reporting fraud (involving a non-
PayPal transaction on eBay) and applying for your
$200 protection is to file a Fraud Alert.
To initiate your Fraud Alert, you may go to the follow-
ing Web address: http://crs.ebay.com/aw-cgi/ebay
isapi.dll?crsstartpage.
You can also find links to the Fraud Alert form in
your My eBay Bidding/Watching Buying-Related
Links at the bottom of the page (as in Figure 7-6)
or in the Security Center’s Buying Safely zone.
• Figure 7-6: The very useful Buying-Related Links in the
My eBay page’s Bidding/Watching tab.
When you arrive at the Online Fraud
Complaint Reporting form, take a deep
breath. You are about to accuse someone of
fraud. Be sure you’ve truly been defrauded;
this program offers no protection for simply
buying an item and changing your mind.
To file a Fraud Alert, be sure of the following:

The item was purchased through an eBay auc-
tion or fixed-price sale.

You can prove that payment was sent in good
faith to the seller. Proof of payment must be 
documentable.

You have not exceeded three claims in the last
six months.

Be sure you have any e-mails sent to you from
the seller as well as any other documentation
that will prove your fraud case.
If your fraud claim is approved, the informa-
tion will be forwarded to the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) for possible further 
investigation.
After eBay receives your completed Fraud Alert, the
crack review team takes over. In short order, you
should receive an e-mail with information (and a
secure link) so you know how and where to file your
Fraud Protection Claim under eBay’s Standard
Purchase Protection Program.
Filing a Claim with PayPal
When you pay with PayPal, whether you’ve paid via
credit card or bank transfer, PayPal protects your
purchase. The PayPal Buyer Protection Program has
all the rules of eBay’s Fraud program — but kicks it
up a notch.
If you paid with PayPal and the listing stated that
you would be covered under the PayPal Buyer
Protection program (as described in Technique 2),
you are covered for up to $500.
To file a claim, you must go to the PayPal Web site
and log in to your account. Then follow these steps:

Building Strategies
for Your Sales
Y
ou can buy the “inside secrets” of eBay from lots of places. Some 
e-book sellers try to convince you that only they have the surrepti-
tious bits of knowledge — gleaned from years (months?) of experi-
ence on the site — that reveal what’s Really Going On. Truth be told, the
eBay market has become an immediate-gratification-shopping arena; the
online retail market changes so quickly that eBay can barely keep up
with it — the profile of the online shopper changes constantly. How likely
is it that anybody has the ultimate answer? Sure, mysterious rumors crop
up — do you hear the Twilight Zone theme playing too? — magical means
to sure-fire auctions. Start an auction at a certain day and time, and you’ll
automatically make more money? Puh-leez!
I have interviewed many of the eBay high-volume sellers (Power Sellers),
and they all confirm that, with the exception of a miniscule few, these “the-
ories” are bunk. The sellers do, however, have some practical preferences
for when and how they conduct their eBay transactions. This technique
gets to the gist of these preferences and the corresponding practices.
The ideas in this technique come from my discussions with current
eBay PowerSellers. These ideas are merely suggestions of methods
and starting points that work for others. You definitely need to test
them out and find out which practices work — for you and for the
types of items you sell.
Knowing What Day to End an Auction
Back when eBay counted its listings by the hundreds (then low thou-
sands), it clearly made a difference what day of the week you chose to
end an auction. That is, when the number of buyers and sellers on eBay
was relatively small, matching your auction time with the bidders’ online
habits was important.
Now that eBay spawns over 13 million listings a day with countless buy-
ers and looky-loos visiting the site, you find the eBay netizens looking for

• Figure 8-2: Seven days of auction action.
• Figure 8-3: A full 10 days of bidding frenzy (if you’re
lucky).
Ending your listing on a major holiday — 
especially the ones that end on Monday, can
have catastrophic results. I actually like to shop
eBay on those days (especially Thanksgiving).
There’s lots of deals for buyers.
Since I can’t list everyone’s opinions on the subject —
that would probably confuse you anyway — here are
the popular item-ending days, ranked in order:
1. Sunday
2. Monday
3. Thursday
4. Tuesday
5. Wednesday
6. Saturday
7. Friday
bargains at virtually all hours of the day and night.
So for a traditional auction, you can choose almost
any ending time and know that you’ll still have some
bidders.
Please realize that there are wildcards in the
mix; they are the Buy It Now and Fixed Price
transactions. Buy It Now and Fixed Price
have become wildly popular on the site.
Interestingly, although they don’t always fol-
low a daily pattern of sales, they can still follow
the preferred auction-ending days you find in
this technique.
The advice in this section encompasses the
opinions of many long-time eBay sellers. Do
not take the advice as gospel. What works for
them may not work for you, so please use
these suggestions as a jumping-off point for
your own research.
Planning your auction end day by the calendar
To get the timeline of an auction, it’s best to look at a
calendar. You need to know when to start an auction,
in order for you to plan the time it ends. Remember
that eBay works by a clock. A seven-day auction
lasts 7 days — not seven days and one second, but 7
full days. Figures 8-1, 8-2 and 8-3 show top preferred
datelines for running a sale on eBay.
You may notice that all these preferred datelines end
on a Sunday. Sunday is the top ranked ending day for
auctions by eBay sellers.
• Figure 8-1: A timeline for a 3-day auction.

Knowing What Day to End an Auction
59
Be sure to coordinate these dates with what
you sell. Some buyers (say, men who buy golf
goods during lunch hour and women who buy
collectibles while their husbands are out golfing
on weekends) can throw these days a curve.
Deciding how many days to run your auction
Again, here’s another little subject with lots of big
opinions. Especially now that eBay has introduced
the one-day auction. Here’s the skinny on the days
and suggested uses.

One-day auction. Did you just get a load of an
item that sells as fast as it’s put up on the site?
Although a buy-it-now feature on any auction can
bring great results, that only works if the item is
hot! hot! hot! If people are bidding the item up —
and they really gotta have it — you may do best
by starting the bidding really low and listing it
with a one-day format.
When you list in a one-day format, your listing
goes right to the top of the list. Most people view
their searches by auctions ending first. With a
one-day format, you can pretty much choose the
time of day your item will be at the top.
If the competition for your item starts their
auctions at $.99 with a reasonable Buy It Now
price, you’ll find bidders foil many of their Buy
It Now offers. Retaliate by listing the item with
a starting bid just a dollar or so below your
Buy It Now (and make your buy it now at least
$.50 below the competition) and you’ll find
your items will be snapped up quickly.

Three-day auction. A three-day is good, for all
the same reasons that a one-day is good — only
it’s better for the faint of heart and Nervous
Nellies (like me) because it gives your item more
time to sell.
Another good use of a three-day auction is
when you already have a seven-day auction
up on the site, and the bidding is going crazy.
You’ve reached your sales goal by the middle
of a seven-day cycle. Once it’s in the last cou-
ple of days of the listing, throw up a second
one on a three-day.

Seven-day auction. The gold standard for eBay
auctions, seven full days of fun, excitement, and
(hopefully) bidding. Seven days gives your item
plenty of time to be seen on the site and attract
bidders.

Ten-day auction. Okay, say you’ve got multiples
of an item that you stock in your eBay store and
want the longest amount of exposure on the auc-
tion site. You can put one up for a ten-day auc-
tion to draw attention to your items and store.
Also, a ten-day auction is good for more eso-
teric items. This can be a special collectible or
an expensive item that normally doesn’t get
listed on the site by the hundred. Putting up a
ten-day auction (starting Friday night — so you
get two weekends’ exposure) is a near-perfect
way to attract bidders.
Figuring out what time to start your auction
As in our previous example, the only way to figure
when to end your auction is by planning when to
start it. An auction beginning at 12:00 will end at that
same time on the ending day.
Make a photocopy of Table 8-1 and keep it by your
computer. (Even after all these years, it still takes
too much time to decipher “eBay time” without a
printed chart.) eBay Time is military time in the
Pacific time zone. The chart converts the eBay clock
to real time for your time zone. If you ever need to
check your time zone, or want to know exactly what
time it is in eBay-land, point your browser to
cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.

and you’ll see the map pictured in Figure 8-4.

Here’s the consensus of some experts in order of
ending-time preference (in eBay Time, check the
table for a translation):
1. 18:00 to 22:00
2. 21:00 to 0:00
3. 15:00 to 18:00
4. 13:00 to 16:00
Worst times to end an auction (ranked from Worst to
Best):
1. 2:00 to 6:00
2. 0:00 to 3:00
This information should give you some good ideas
for your own auction sales.

Finding eBay’s Soon-to-Be
“Hot” Sellers
Everyone wants to know (the second-most-often-
asked question I get) What’s the hot ticket on the
eBay site? How can they find out what’s selling best
so they can run out, buy it, and make big money on
eBay? Whoa, there, big fella.
As I’ve been known to say elsewhere, I am not a
believer in the notion that eBay is a “get-rich-quick”
program. Nobody can give you secret information
that magically transforms you from a garage seller
to a warehouse tycoon overnight. You get there
by studying the market, learning what works and
what doesn’t. That’s the way the top sellers, who
continue to sell on the site, learned eBay. There are
no shortcuts.
That said, here’s where you can find information on
what’s hot or what’s going to be hot on the site.
Hot on the home page
New shoppers to the site generally enter from the
home page at www.eBay.com.
• Figure 8-5: The eBay Home Page feature promotion.
In case you haven’t noticed, eBay runs promotions
smack  in the center of the home page (as in
Figure 8-5) — immediately drawing the attention
of anyone who drops in to browse the site. Each
item listed in the feature links to an eBay search for
such items.
Now wouldn’t you be the smart one if you were to
list items that coincided with the eBay promotions?
Oh yeah — and I’ll tell you where you can find them.

The eBay site is the world’s host for popular culture.
If it’s hot, people come here to look for it. Aside from
following the media (and other sources I point out in
Starting an eBay Business For Dummies, also from
Wiley), you should also look on the Internet to find
the buzz.
By buzz I mean the latest gossip, rumor, or thing
that’s talked about at the water cooler at work. It’s
the thing on everyone’s tongues for the current
nanosecond in time. Something that’s merely buzz
can become a trend — and trends are what you look
for to follow into the world of eBay.
You can find the beginnings of buzz in any news
report or on your Internet provider’s home page.
It’s news.
Yahoo! keeps a page on the site called the Buzz Index.
You can find it on buzz.yahoo.com. It’s a weekly com-
pilation of items that have received the largest num-
ber of searches on their system. They show what’s
new on the list, what’s going up, what’s going down.
Figure 8-7 shows the Buzz List from January 11, 2004.
You can go to eBay’s Seller Central, or directly to
pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/calendar.html.
Here you’ll find a current list of items that will be fea-
tured in the next couple of months. Take a look at
Figure 8-6 and see how the event from the merchan-
dising calendar carefully matches the headline from
the promotion shown in Figure 8-5.

Setting Profitable

S
elling on eBay is a grand idea. You clean out your garage, sell things
you would have thrown away anyway, and make a profit. What a
wonderful marketplace! You can make money in your spare time,
enhance your lifestyle and all — with a few clicks on your keyboard and
mouse. You get to the challenge — or should I say challenges — when
you’ve run out of junk to sell and decide to sell on eBay in earnest.
This is where the novice eBay seller runs into problems. Very few eBay
sellers have a background in retailing or marketing, and that’s what eBay
is all about — retailing and marketing. Universities offer degrees in both
areas, so there must be something worth learning. In Part I of this book,
you find a crash course in buying; this part of the book helps with your
selling.
In this technique, I give you tips on pricing strategies — and the first item
on the agenda is to understand all the fees involved with running an e-
business on eBay.
Keeping an Eye on Where Your Pennies Go
It doesn’t seem so much, $.30 to list an item, and a small Final Value fee.
Of course, a few cents go to PayPal. One by one, these minute amounts
tend to breeze by the seller. You don’t really see your eBay fees, because
they’re not directly deducted from your sales. eBay bills you at the end of
the month. It’s easy to lose track of your costs unless you are keeping
very good books (more on that in Technique 45).
All those nickels, dimes, and quarters build up. The hundreds (thou-
sands?) of sellers who are selling items on the site for $1 can’t be
making much of a profit — not even enough for a pack of gum! So to
avoid this low-profit trap, you must be keenly aware of every penny
you spend on eBay listing fees, eBay Final Value fees, listing options,
and PayPal fees.

Using Reserve Fees to Save Money
65
Minimizing eBay Listing Fees
eBay listing fees are based on your starting bid price,
or your amount for a Fixed Price sale. Although eBay
listing fees have remained somewhat stable over the
years, in February 2004, eBay raised the rates and
changed their pricing levels. For a very long time,
the most you would pay to list a regular item on the
eBay site was $3.30. Now it’s $4.80.
For years, the base listing fee was $.30 for any item
priced from $.01 to $9.99. As Table 9-1 shows, the lit-
tle guy (the seller with lower-priced items to sell)
takes a minor hit: the percentage of starting price
paid in fees. At least it looks like a minor hit. But
when you work in percentages (and they’re what
really count in retailing), that’s a 16.6-percent
increase over the original fee. Before the rate
increase in late January 2004, over 12,000 listings
started at $1 and had the word antique in the title;
sellers these days are moving away from that
approach. Here’s why . . .
If you’re planning to start your auctions at
$1.00, consider starting them at $.99 instead.
You save 16.6 percent in listing fees! One
seller I know made that change to his auctions
and saved $2,400 a month!
Table 9-1 shows you the current listing fees. Notice
that the higher your starting price is, the higher
your actual fee.

Perhaps now you’re thinking, I can use a low listing
fee and tack on a reserve price. (There’s fresh news
in the reserve area as well — those fees are higher
than before, but are refundable if the item sells.)
You can always work the reserve to your advantage,
but remember: Bidders get edgy when they see a
reserve-price auction — they start to wonder whether
they should spend their time bidding on the auction
or maybe find a better deal elsewhere.
Using Reserve Fees 
to Save Money
Placing a reserve price on one of your auctions, as
pictured in Figure 9-1, means that the item will not
sell until the bidding reaches the reserve price.
When your reserve-price item does sell, two good
things happen: You’ve sold your item at a profit (let’s
hear it for optimism!) and eBay refunds your reserve
fee. YAY!
• Figure 9-1: I’ll bet this auction has a hefty reserve!
The reserve fee is based on the reserve price you
set, as outlined in Table 9-2.
Put your reserve price at the top of your listing
description. That way there is a good chance
the buyer will know what they’re in for. You
could also offer free shipping in a reserve auc-
tion to take the edge off.

The key here is to calculate, before you list your auc-
tion, whether it costs you more in fees to use a
reserve or to list with a higher starting price.
Table 9-3 compares the same item with different list-
ing strategies.

Wow! Aren’t you surprised? (I was too!)
If your item doesn’t sell the first time at the
higher starting price, you can always relist it at
a lower starting price and then use a reserve.
If it sells, you’ll still get the listing fees waived
and you won’t have to pay a reserve fee at all.
Second Chance to Sell!
If you have an item up for sale on the site, and the auction
goes above your target sales price and you have more of
the item in stock, you can offer another of the item to an
underbidder.
Figure 9-2 shows you where, at the end of a multiple bid-
der auction, you can click to offer the item to any of the
underbidders for his or her high bid.
• Figure 9-2: It’s the underbidder’s lucky day.
You will only be charged Final Value fees — not a second
relisting fee — if the person purchases the item.
Adding Listing Upgrades
eBay listings, just like anything that comes with
extras (your new car, for example), have many
options and upgrades. But also like your new car’s
options, they cost you money. eBay’s optional
upgrades are almost as fun as heated car seats in
the winter — but only if they make you money!
Figure 9-3 shows how even a random search on eBay
listings can yield examples of some very popular list-
ing options:

Gallery. This option definitely draws attention to
your item. Gallery listings show a small picture
next to the item title. The tempting glimpse grabs
the gaze of potential buyers right away; a listing
with the camera icon simply indicates that a pic-
ture of the item is available in the listing descrip-
tion. The gallery option costs 25 cents — and
gets a good draw for your money.

Buy It Now. In our immediate-gratification soci-
ety, the But It Now option is very attractive to
savvy eBay shoppers. Of course, those same
savvy eBay shoppers know just how much they

Adding Listing Upgrades
67
want to spend, and if your Buy It Now price is
too high, they may blast right by your listing. Use
Buy It Now for items you have in stock, with a
clear target price. For five cents, Buy It Now can
move your merchandise quickly.

Bold. Applying boldface to your item title really
spices it up and pulls it off the page right into the
reader’s eye. Unfortunately, bold adds an addi-
tional $1 to your listing cost, so you better be in
a position to make some good profit from the
item. Make sure your research shows that it can
sell for your target price.

Item Subtitle. Notice the subtitle under one of the
auctions. This is your opportunity to add addi-
tional text to your title, readable by prospective
buyers as they scan a search or browse a cate-
gory. A caveat, this additional text will only be
picked up if the searcher is searching both titles
and descriptions. The additional text does not get
pulled up in a title only search. The fee for this is
50 cents. All the text in the world won’t help if
your starting price is far above your competition.

eBay Picture Services
If you are shopping the site or even researching your
competitor’s auctions, you’ll notice that some sellers
have a small picture of their item at the top of their
auction page as in Figure 9-4.
What a great selling point this is. The prospective
buyer can see your item the second they click the
page! Best of all there’s no additional cost to the
seller.
eBay offers the first picture free of cost to all sellers.
It’s definitely something you should take advantage
of. Any additional pictures (easily uploaded to your
item page) cost $.15 each. If you want the picture to
supersize (get bigger) when the buyer clicks it, add
an additional $.75 to your fees.

PayPal Gets Its Cut 
of the Action
When you’ve sold your item, you think that’s the end
of the fees? Nope! If your customer pays via PayPal,
you’re faced with fess for using the PayPal service.
Having a PayPal Premier or Business account is
important to build your commerce for these reasons:

eBay buyers look for the PayPal option because
it offers them another level of protection against
fraud.
• Figure 9-4: Your free top-of-the-page picture when you
use the free photo from eBay’s picture
services.
Always use the free picture — after all, it’s free!
But why not save extra fees by uploading your
own additional pictures for your auction? (See
Technique 19 for full instructions on how to do
this on your own.)
Adding In the Final Value Fees
Final Value fees (FVFs) are charges on the amount
that your item sells for — not including whatever you
charge for shipping. Thank goodness eBay hasn’t
raised the FVFs lately — they’re hard enough to cal-
culate as it is! Table 9-5 shows the basics of the Final
Value fee and how it’s calculated.

Putting All the Fees Together with FeeFinder
69

Most customers prefer to pay with a credit card,
either to delay the expense or to have complete
records of their purchases.

From a seller’s point of view, using PayPal can be
cheaper than having a direct-merchant credit
card account.

PayPal helps with your paperwork by offering
downloadable logs of your sales that include all
PayPal fees. eBay fees are not included; you’re on
your own for those.
The difference between a Premier or a Business
account is that a Premier account allows you to
do business under your own name. A business
account requires the account to be registered in
a business name.
PayPal fees are fairly straightforward: Every transac-
tion is charged a $.30 transaction fee, plus a percent-
age of the total collected — including your shipping
charges. The percentage collected at the standard
rate is 2.9 percent; for a merchant rate, it’s 2.2 
percent.
The standard rate is charged to all new users of
PayPal. After you’ve been accepting PayPal for a
while and have received at least $1,000 a month
through PayPal for three months, you have qualified
for a Merchant rate.
Even after you’re qualified, you won’t get the
Merchant Rate automatically. As you attain the
needed level of sales, you must e-mail PayPal
(once you’ve logged in to your account) to
point out that you’ve attained it, ask them to
put the lower rate into effect, and request that
your account be converted to a Merchant
account.
Putting All the Fees Together
with FeeFinder
I don’t have the time (or honestly, even the inclina-
tion) to total the applicable fees and expenses for
every item I put up on eBay. But I do not recommend
such laziness to anyone trying to earn a living on
eBay.
To combat the laziness that I fear will drastically
affect my bottom line, I use a program called
FeeFinder, which totals up all the appropriate fees
automatically. I use this program to help make better
business decisions on pricing my items — and so
can you! Here’s the drill:
1.
Get and install a copy of FeeFinder.
For a free trial version (or to purchase it at 
a discounted rate), visit the Web site at www.
hammertap.com/coolebaytools and follow the
instructions you find there. After you install the
FeeFinder software, follow the remaining steps
to calculate your item costs:
2.
Input your price and choose the appropriate
settings.
There are four tabs at the top of the FeeFinder
page. First (as in Figure 9-5) is the single item
page. Just input the starting price of your auction,
whether you have a reserve or not, and click off
any options you’ve used (in the example, I’ve
clicked off Gallery). The second tab performs the
same task for a multiple-item sale or “Dutch”
auction.
• Figure 9-5: FeeFinder’s Single Item tab.

Forewarned Is Smart
Once you know all the fees involved in selling your
item, you can play around with the pricing and figure
out how much your Buy It Now (or target selling)
price should be.
Remember to include all these costs when pricing
your items:

How much you paid for the item you want to
resell.

The Freight In amount (the cost of shipping the
item to you).

The cost of shipping the item to your buyer. (Visit
Technique 9 for information on how to calculate
the cost involved in your shipping the item out to
your buyers.)
Researching with eBay
PSP Software
First off, what’s a PSP? A PSP is an eBay Preferred
Service Provider — a company big enough to make
a large technological and financial commitment to
eBay. These vendors express that preference by
designing software and solutions to enhance proce-
dures for small, medium, or large businesses inter-
ested in doing business on eBay. Those products are
generally too expensive for a seller who hasn’t
attained Power Seller status.
A new eBay PSP, HammerTap (the same people
who make FeeFinder) have a program called
DeepAnalysis — powerful software that can analyze
any eBay market sector. You can get current or past
sales results by category or search term.
3.
Type in your estimate of the closing bid and
click Calculate.
I used my Buy It Now Price (hey, why not?) and
Bingo — all figured out to the penny.
The next tab (Figure 9-6) calculates your PayPal
fees. Just indicate which level of PayPal account
you have and whether the payment is an eCheck
or Credit Card. Type in the total amount you’ll
collect from the buyer — including shipping.
Press the calculate button and your PayPal fees
will show up.
4.
Add the two together and you’ve got your total
expenses for that sale at the prescribed price.
• Figure 9-6: FeeFinder’s PayPal fee-calculating tab.
There is a fourth tab, called Shipping, which has
links to all the shipping calculators for all the major
shipping companies in the United States, United
Kingdom and Germany. There’s even a link to Freight
forwarders to get estimates on items too large to
ship through the regular resources.

Researching with eBay PSP Software
71
With DeepAnalysis, you can do some serious 
business:

Research a particular item; see how much it sells
for, and see who’s selling it.

Examine a category and check out total sales,
average sell-through rate, and statistics for
Dutch or Reserve auctions.

Find out the most popular, highest-priced items
with the average sell price.

Get all kinds of sell-through rates.
That’s just a sample of what these higher-end tools
can do. When your eBay business gets to Power
Seller level, they start to make good sense as an
investment.

Setting Sensible
Shipping Costs
B
uyers who visit the eBay site are bargain shoppers. They want to
get their items at the lowest possible prices. They’re also becoming
more cognizant about the “hidden” expense buried in the item’s
shipping and handling fees. When you set these fees, you must take into
account every expense involved in your packing and shipping. You can’t
make your shipping area a losing proposition.
Too many eBay sellers — unquestionably out of greed — have increased
shipping prices to outrageous amounts. I’ll bet those sellers think they’ve
found a cute way to save a couple of cents off their Final Value fees (after
all, Final Value fees aren’t charged on shipping costs). But when the ship-
ping fee equals a third of the item cost, a prospective bidder may think
twice about placing a bid. Of course if the item is big and/or the buyer
wants it fast, he or she may feel better about paying higher fees.
Business is business, and when you’re on eBay to make a profit, every
penny counts. In this technique, I tell you how to evaluate all the costs
involved with packing and shipping the items you sell. Also, I show
you how to use the tools at your disposal — such as eBay’s Shipping
Calculator — to make the best decisions about how to charge your buy-
ers for your shipping costs.
Figuring the Hidden Shipping Costs
When calculating shipping costs, don’t assume you have just the 
cost of your postage. You also have per-item costs for boxes, padded
mailers, shipping tape, labels, and pickup or service fees from your
carriers. Now and again, you may even pay the college kid across the
street five bucks to schlep your boxes for you. Expenses show up in
the strangest places.
In addition to adding up the packing and shipping supplies, you need to
amortize the monthly fees from any online postage shipping services.
When you occasionally pay for a pickup from the carrier, you need to add

Figuring the Hidden Shipping Costs
73
that expense to the shipping charges, too. The follow-
ing list runs down some of the expenses involved:

Padded mailers. Select an average-size padded
mailer that works for several of the types of
items that you sell. Selecting an average size for
all your products works well because everything
is cheaper when buying in quantity. Even if a few
of your items could fit in the next-size-down mail-
ers, buying the bigger size by the case gives you
a considerable discount. (For more on standard
mailer size, see Technique 34.) Why keep five dif-
ferent sizes of mailers in stock in quantities of
100 if you don’t have to? If you don’t use all of
the bigger ones, you can always sell them. And
besides, padded envelopes don’t go bad.
Don’t be misled by packaging suppliers’ claims
that their mailers cost only __¢ each. They
usually don’t include the shipping costs in
these price “estimates.” Add the shipping that
you’ll pay to the cost of the packaging supplies
you’re buying. Then divide by the quantity
purchased to get your cost per item.
When you price out your cost-per-piece, be sure
to include (as part of your cost) what you have
to pay to get the item shipped to you. The prices
shown here were taken off the eBay site during
this writing. So, if you purchase your mailers —
say #4’s (9 1/2” x 14 1/2”) — by the hundred, they
may cost you $.40 each. If you buy a case of 500,
they may only cost $.28 each. By buying in quan-
tity, you save $.12 per mailing envelope! The
more business you do, the more significant the
savings.

Packing Peanuts. I must admit that storing all
those packing peanuts is a real drag. (See the
upcoming tip for a storage idea.) Here is where
buying in bulk also equates to a huge cost sav-
ings. The figures below include shipping cost;
you can purchase:
4.5 cubic feet for $11.99 = $2.66 per cu ft
10 cubic feet for $21.98 = $2.20 per cu ft
20 cubic feet for $43.96 = $2.20 per cu ft
Actually, 10 cubic feet turns out to be the most
economical deal — due to the high amount that
shipping adds to the equation. eBay sellers who
sell packing peanuts offer them for half what
they cost when you purchase them from a brick-
and-mortar retailer. (That’s because a store you
can actually walk into has to use up square
footage to store these babies, which means a
higher cost.)
In one of my other eBay books, I share my
solution to peanut storage, and I’ve been
asked to include it here as well. Here it is (in a
nutshell): Take some drawstring-type trash
bags. Fill them fully with peanuts, then tie the
drawstring. Screw some cup hooks into the
rafters of your garage and hang the bags from
the rafters. You can store a bunch of peanuts
there! Be sure to recycle!

Packing tape. Packing tape is free for Priority Mail
packages (see Technique 34), but for other uses,
you need a stock of clear packing tape. The com-
mon size for a roll is 2 inches wide by 110 feet
long. The following eBay prices include shipping:
6 rolls = $13.49 = $2.25 per roll
12 rolls = $20.27 = $1.69 per roll
36-roll case = $49.85 = $1.38 per roll
Again, compare prices before buying.

Boxes. Price out boxes in quantity orders. I won’t
take you through the various costs of boxes
because hundreds of sizes are available. Shop
eBay, and check out www.uline.com for boxes at
reasonable prices. For our example, let’s just say
a typical box will cost $.38 each.

G&A (general and administrative) costs. For the
uninitiated (translation=you never had to do
budgets at a large corporation), G&A represents
the costs incurred in running a company. But the
principle is familiar: Time is money. For example,
the time it takes you to research the costs of
mailers, tapes, and boxes on eBay is costing you
money. The time it takes for you to drive to the
Post Office costs you money. We won’t actually

Using a Shipping Calculator
in Your Listings
If you put a flat shipping fee on some larger items,
you may be costing yourself money. Make every-
thing fair for the buyer (and for you) — use eBay’s
free shipping calculator to post clear shipping
charges for your items.
When listing an item for sale on eBay, you come to
the area where you need to input your payment and
shipping information. You have the option of using a
flat rate (as in Figure 10-1) where you simply input
your flat shipping charges. These appear in a box at
the bottom of your item description.

charges on the items you list on eBay. Follow these
steps to have eBay calculate the charges for you

put a figure on this just now, but it’s something
you need to think about — especially if you
spend half an hour at the Post Office every other
day. In effect, that’s time wasted. You could be
finding new sources of merchandise with the
time. It costs you money that you might have
earned.

Online postage service. If you’re paying around
$10 a month for the convenience of buying and
printing online postage, you have to assume
that’s an expense too. If you ship 100 packages a
month, that amortizes to $.10 per package.
If you’re questioning whether you need an
online postage service, here’s my two cents:
Being able to hand your packages to the
postal carrier still beats standing in line at the
Post Office.
When you add together expenses from this list, you
have the cost for mailing out a padded envelope
cushioned with packing peanuts, as in Table 10-1.

Using eBay’s
Free Listing Tool:
Turbo Lister
N
ot much in this world is free, but for now, eBay offers you a free,
convenient tool you can use to list your items for sale: Turbo
Lister. It’s powerful software that provides a professional capabil-
ity (and look) to the medium-size eBay seller. Turbo Lister helps you
organize your items for sale, design their ads, and list them. It also organ-
izes your items for future relisting by saving your initial item input and
allowing you to create folders for organized storage. Your items disap-
pear from Turbo Lister only if you delete them.
Although you get the Turbo Lister program free, you’re still respon-
sible for any fees you incur by listing an item on the site.
Turbo Lister is robust software with the following features:

Self Updates. Turbo Lister automatically updates itself regularly from
the eBay site, and includes any new eBay enhancements so your list-
ings always take advantage of eBay’s latest features.
Whenever you start the program and it finishes loading, it immediately
checks with the eBay server for updates. Waiting for this update can
be a bit tedious (especially if the servers are busy), so if you plan on
listing items at a particular time, open Turbo Lister with a few minutes
to spare.

HTML Templates. Pre-designed HTML templates are built into the pro-
gram’s Listing Designer. If you use one of eBay’s multitude of colorful
themes or layouts, you’ll be charged an additional $.10 on top of your
listing fees. You can use these or a template of your own design to
jumpstart your ad design (without extra charge) by pasting it into the
HTML view. You can even use templates from other sources (such as
those in Technique 19), as long as they are in HTML format.

WYSIWYG Interface. If you choose to design your own ads from
scratch, you can do it with Turbo Lister’s easy-to-use WYSIWYG (What
You See Is What You Get) layout designer.

All Item Listing Capabilities without being online.
By using Turbo Lister (with its constant auto-
upgrading), you will not sacrifice any of the fea-
tures available to you when you list on the site
using the Sell Your Item form.
In this technique, you’ll have an inside look at how
Turbo Lister works. Then, when you download the
software, you can get up to speed quickly.
Checking the Minimum
Requirements
Though this software is definitely useful, you have to
decide whether it’s really for you. The first thing to
check is whether your computer meets Turbo
Lister’s minimum requirements.

Your computer must be a PC, not a Mac (sorry,
Mac users). You have to have the Windows 98, 98
SE, ME, NT 4+SP6, 2000, or XP operating system.

The processor must be at least a Pentium II. The
faster your processor, the better.

You must have at least 64MB of RAM (and that’s
a bare minimum).
The more RAM you have, the better things
work.

You should have at least 20MB of free space on
your hard drive to run the installation.

Monitor settings at least 800 x 600 resolution and
256 colors (8-bit). Keep in mind the software
interface looks a lot better with 16-bit color and
1024 x 768 resolution. All monitors today have
this capability, so you should be just fine here.

Microsoft Internet Explorer should be 
version 5.01 or later.

Downloading Turbo Lister
On the bottom of most eBay pages, you’ll see a
group of links like the ones shown in Figure 11-3.
Click the handy eBay Downloads link to display the
eBay Downloads page.
• Figure 11-3: eBay’s navigation links.
Now, to download Turbo Lister, follow these steps:
1.
Scroll down the eBay Downloads page to locate
the Selling Tools area and click on eBay Turbo
Lister.
The Seller Tools, Turbo Lister hub page appears.
2. Click the Download Now link.
The requirements for using Turbo Lister appear
above the two links for downloading.
3.
Click the Turbo Lister Web Setup link.
The Windows Security Warning appears (shown
in Figure 11-4), cautioning that you’re about to
download something foreign to your computer.
4.
Click Yes.
Clicking Yes downloads Turbo Lister. Clicking No
doesn’t. Just trust me (and eBay) and click Yes.
From this point on, installation is automatic until —
voilà! You’ve got Turbo Lister on your computer!
Note that this procedure first downloads a small
setup version of the program that checks your com-
puter for preinstalled files. When that task is done,
Turbo Lister checks back with mothership eBay and
automatically downloads any files it needs.
• Figure 11-4: The Windows Security warning.
Starting Up Turbo Lister
Once you’ve installed the program, you’ll see a new
icon on your desktop; a little green man (don’t call
Mulder — yet!) juggling magic pixie dust over his
head. This is the icon for Turbo Lister. Double-click
it and you’ll see the Turbo Lister Introduction screen
shown in Figure 11-5. This will pop up every time
you open the program — which can get annoying. It
doesn’t really do anything for you and wastes pre-
cious seconds of your time. If you want to avoid it,
click the check box labeled Do not show me this
screen again, and then click Start Here. The little
green man’s screen will be forever banished.
When the program is open, the first thing you do is
set up a new Turbo Lister file, as follows:
1.
Select that option from the opening splash, and
click Next.
2.
Type your eBay User ID and password in the
blanks and click Next.
Turbo Lister now wants to connect back to eBay
to retrieve your eBay account information. Make
sure your Internet connection is live.

1.
Click the Create New button (the one with the
magic-wand symbol) in the upper-left corner.
The Step One screen appears, as in Figure 11-6.
This is where you decide the type of listing you
want. You’ll notice that most of the information
requested is identical to the eBay Sell Your Item
form.
• Figure 11-6: Selecting your listing format.
2.
Click the Auction radio button, and then click
Next.
The Create a New Item page appears, ready for
you to enter your title and subtitle if you wish.
You can save bunches of time if you write
your titles and descriptions before you go into
Turbo Lister. You can type them into Notepad
or Word, and then copy and paste them into
the listing, adding the HTML tags after the
text is inserted.
3.
Enter the title in the Item Title Box.
If you want to use a subtitle, type that in as well.
Subtitles are handy for adding selling points that
accompany your title in search results. (Entering
a subtitle for your auction adds an additional
$.50 charge.)
4.
Select your category by clicking the Find
Category button.
• Figure 11-5: The colorful (though useless) Turbo Lister

After you check for a live Internet connection,
click the Connect Now button.
In a minute or so, a small window opens with
your eBay registration information (your name,
address, and registered e-mail address). The last
text block on the page offers you the option of
listing locally.
4.
Click the down arrow in the corner of the last
text box and choose the eBay region within
your metropolitan area, if there is one.
Your item will be searchable within your region
of the United States.
5.
Click Finish, and the program fires up.
Preparing an eBay Listing
Now that you have the powerful Turbo Lister tool at
hand, you can prepare hundreds of eBay listings in
advance and, with one click of the mouse, launch
them on eBay. You can also select a scheduling
format that makes your listings upload and start at a
particular time and date. (More on that in the section,
“Uploading items to eBay,” later in this technique).
This example lists an auction using these steps:

Preparing an eBay Listing
81
You are presented with a screen that lists all
eBay categories in a hierarchal format. The main
categories are listed with a plus sign next to
them. When you find your main category, click
on the plus sign, and subcategories are dis-
played, as shown in Figure 11-7. To drop even
lower into the world of nether-categories, keep
clicking plus signs next to subcategories. You
know you’ve hit the bottom rung of the category
ladder when you see only a minus sign.
• Figure 11-7: Select your final category and click OK.
5.
If you have an eBay Store, select a category
for the item in your store from a drop-down
menu. Open the drop-down menu (shown in
Figure 11-8) by clicking the small arrow on the
right. Then click the category you want to use
and watch it jump into the selection area.
This area is automatically populated from your
eBay Store when eBay updates your Turbo Lister
installation.
6.
After you make all your selections, click Next to
continue.
• Figure 11-8: Select your eBay Store Category from the
drop-down list.
Designing your listing
When it comes to designing your listing, you’ve got
several options. Take a look at the Listing Templates
on the left side of the screen. Click on them and be
dazzled by their glory. eBay makes it a snap to
design your item listing with a few easy features:

Templates and Themes: I’m sure you’ve seen
eBay listings with very nice graphics in the bor-
ders. These come from eBay’s easy-to-use theme
templates listed on the left of the screen. You
may select any of these colorful templates to doll
up your listing. Themes make the listing look
pretty, but they may draw attention away from
the selling strength of your pictures. Remember,
it’s your good description and a quality photo
that will sell your item. Keep in mind, though,
that eBay charges you an additional $.10 to use
one of these themes in your listing. You don’t
have to use any of the themes (just click None
when you reach this screen).

Layout: You may select from several Layouts:
Standard, Photos Left, Photos Right, One Photo

• Figure 11-11: Inserting an e-mail link in the description
area.

HTML View: If you have a smattering of HTML
knowledge, you may want to display the HTML
view and edit your listing design from there. You
can also insert your hosted images by entering
supplementary coding into the HTML view. (See
Technique 20 for additional information about
coding and on inserting your pictures into the
description area.) Also, if you have your own 
predesigned template, just copy and paste the
HTML for the template into the HTML view box.
At any time during the design process, click the
Preview tab to see what your listing looks like.
Be sure to add any additional pictures using eBay’s
Picture Services so that you can use the free header
picture. Just click on one of the boxes entitled Click
Here to Insert Picture, select any picture on your com-
puter’s hard drive, and it will upload with your list-
ing to eBay. When your picture appears in the Turbo
Lister box, click Next.
Getting down to specifics
Now it’s time to get all the little details into your list-
ing. How many days do you want the listing to run?
Top, Photos Bottom, or Slide Show if you want to
take advantage of eBay’s Slide Show option.
When you use eBay Picture Services, the first
picture is free. By using your first free picture,
you can have a great-looking header picture at
the top of your listing page. Additional pic-
tures are 15 cents and a slide show will cost
you the princely sum of 75 cents.

WYSIWYG HTML Design Form: You can base
your ad on this very easy-to-use design form and
come up with a listing that looks similar to the
one shown in Figure 11-9. It has a toolbar very
similar to the formatting toolbar in Microsoft
Word (see Figure 11-10), so the buttons should
be familiar. There’s even a command to insert a
Web link into your description (see Figure 11-11),
so you can have the prospective buyer e-mail
you with a click of the mouse.
• Figure 11-9: The Design Your Listing page in Design View.

You must add your shipping and payment informa-
tion, and more. You do all this on the Format Specifics
page, your last page as shown in Figure 11-12.
• Figure 11-12: The Format Specifics page.
Much of this information is filled in for you by eBay.
You can edit the information pertaining to an option
such as Payment Methods and Ship To Location by
clicking the Change button in the appropriate box.
Note that on this page, each format option has a
Change button. Clicking the Change button opens
a small box where you may add text or change
defaults. After you make your changes, click OK. The
new information appears in the appropriate Format
Specifics box.
Save time by saving repetitive text as the
default. When you come to a box such as
Payment Instructions or Payment Methods, and
you want this exact information to appear in all
your listings, click the Save for Future Listings
check box to save this information as your
default. You can always change the info on a
case-by-case basis when listing another item.
Once you’ve filled out all the information in each of
the Format Specifics areas, click Save.
Organizing your listings
Once you’ve put together a few listings, your Turbo
Lister Item Inventory begins to look something like
Figure 11-13.
• Figure 11-13: Turbo Lister Item Inventory.
Note that you can add folders to the folder list to
save inventories for different categories of items.
To create a folder and move items into it:
1.
Click the down arrow next to Create New (on
the button with the magic wand) and select the
command to create a new folder.
2.
Give your new folder a name and click OK.
The folder now appears in a folder list on the left
side of the screen.
3.
Highlight a listing and drag it to your new
folder.
You can save time if you press and hold the
Control or the Shift key while selecting multi-
ple items. Then you drag them to the folder all
at once.

On the Listings Waiting to Upload tab, click
Upload All to eBay to send your items to eBay
immediately.
eBay calculates your fees before posting the listing;
you can approve them before the listing goes live on
the site.
Approve the upload, and instantly your items will be
live on the site!
You now have the option of looking at your items
in an All Items view (All Items includes those you
have inserted into folders), or by double-clicking
to open the various folders.
Uploading items to eBay
Here’s how you upload the items you see on the Item
Inventory tab:
1.
In the Item Inventory list, highlight the item you
want to upload and click the Add to Upload but-
ton at lower right.
This copies your item to the Listings Waiting to
Upload tab.
2.
If you want to schedule a listing to upload at
a later date or time, click Schedule to Start On
and choose a date and time before clicking the
Add to Upload button.
You’re charged an additional $.10 fee for any
item you choose to schedule for a delayed 
listing.
When you’ve populated your Listings Waiting to
Upload list, you can view it by clicking the tab,
which looks similar to Figure 11-14.

Making Multiple
Sales without
Multiplying Your
Work
O
ne of the most efficient ways to run an eBay business is to stock
the same item in quantity. After getting some eBay experience
under your belt, you’re bound to find several items that you’re
comfortable selling. In addition, if you follow my suggestions in Techni-
que 5, you’ll buy multiples (dozens? cases? pallets?) of the items at a seri-
ously discounted price. But when you have all these items lying around
the garage, your goal is to get them into buyers’ hands at a profit.
In Technique 41, I talk about opening an eBay store. But in addition to
your own store, you must be running auctions on the eBay site. Why?
Auctions are the key to drawing buyers into your store. Stores are not
only added potential sales, but they’re a distinct marketing tool for your
personal eBay brand.
If you don’t have an eBay Store and plan to sell the items one at a time
through auctions, you don’t want to reinvent the wheel for each sale.
Relisting your items efficiently will save you time and aggravation.
I know several sellers who have bought items in such bulk that
they’re stocked with the item to sell one a week for the next few
years! That’s a good thing only if the product is a staple item that will
always have a market on eBay.
Relisting after a Win
Yeah! Your space-age can opener with built-in DVD player sold! Since you
have three dozen more to sell, the quicker you can get that item back up
on the site, the sooner you’ll connect with the next customer.
When bidders lose an auction on eBay, one of the first things they do is
search for somebody offering the same item. The sooner you get an item
relisted, the sooner a disappointed underbidder will find your listing. Of
course, relisting the item also makes it available to other interested bid-
ders who may not have bid on the item before because the bidding went
out of their league.

sellers run out of the item. Then put yours up for
auction — you may just get more bidding action if
you are one of the few (versus one of the many) sell-
ers offering the same item.
I have quite a few items that I purchased cases of —
right along with a bunch of other eBay sellers. They
desperately dumped theirs on the site, without pay-
ing any attention to the competition. I waited, and
got my target price for the item the following season.
eBay is a supply-and-demand marketplace. If
the supply exceeds the demand, prices go
down. If you have an item that sells as fast as
you can list it, prices go up.
Okay, Time to Relist
eBay gives you so many ways to relist an item, that
it’s almost dizzying. There are efficient ways and
ways that will waste your time. Because this book
is all about saving time, let’s just concern ourselves
with the speedy ways.
Figure 12-1 shows the seller’s version of a sold item
(only the seller sees this when they are signed in),
which includes a link to relist. If you relist all your
items using this link on each item’s page you’ll have
to go to the page for every item you want to relist to
find the corresponding link. To save time, get off the
auction page and go to My eBay page or Selling
Manager. These tools were designed to make relist-
ing fast.
• Figure 12-1: Yeah! My item sold!
When you offer an item for bidding and it
reaches well beyond your target price, why
not offer another one? True, this will slow (or
possibly end) further bidding on the first item,
but if you’ve exceeded your target price and
there are folks out there hot for your item —
sell it to them now! That kind of initiative is
what eBay is all about.
If at First You Don’t Succeed
Boo! Your Dansk China Maribo dinner plate didn’t sell.
Don’t take it personally. It’s not that someone out
there doesn’t love you. It doesn’t mean that your mer-
chandise is trash. It’s just that this particular week no
one was looking for Maribo plates (go figure).
Often eBay shoppers shop with no discernible pat-
tern. Some weeks no one may want your item at a
certain price and then you may sell five or six the
next week. It happens to me all the time.
If you don’t have your auctions listed on the
eBay site, your goods will stay on your shelves
and get dusty. If you list your items regularly,
someone will buy them and send you money.
Find something that will sell now!
Often, when relisting, you need to make
adjustments. For instance, there’s always a
chance that you’re off base on your title. Or
perhaps the keywords in your title aren’t draw-
ing people to your listing. To help you figure
out whether it’s you or just the market, try
running a search for other, similar items — is
anyone buying? If there’s just no bidding activ-
ity (perhaps you’re selling bikinis in January?),
then perhaps that item needs to be retired
from eBay for a while.
Consider some other variables. Perhaps your start-
ing price is too high? Are other items selling on the
site with a lower starting price? If you can comfort-
ably lower your price, do so. If not, wait until other

Okay, Time to Relist

Relisting from your My eBay page
Your My eBay page has lots of handy features. Best
of all, it has all your sold and unsold items in one
convenient area. It’s so much easier to see all your
sold or unsold items at once!
Figure 12-2 shows My eBay displaying the Items I’ve
Sold area. The Unsold Items area is further down on
the My eBay Selling tab and has similar columns of
information.
• Figure 12-2: Sample items I’ve sold.
Note that the second to the last column is titled
Relist. If you click the Relist link for an item, a fully
filled in, Sell Your Item page appears. You can then
make any changes you want — or not!
What’s so very convenient about this method is that
all your sold (or unsold) listings appear in one place.
You can just go down the list and quickly relist items.
Relisting from Selling Manager
Wouldn’t it be better if you could select a whole
bunch of items at once and list them all together?
Step up to Selling Manager for a one-click option.
I really like Selling Manager as a tool for the mid-
sized eBay seller (even a PowerSeller). One of the
many excellent features of the program is that you
can relist multiple items in bulk.
You can access items that have sold, logically enough,
from the Sold Items area (pictured in Figure 12-3).
Relisting is done with a click of the mouse! (On the
other hand, if you haven’t been so lucky lately, you
can look at your unsold items in the Unsold Items
area.)
To relist an item through Selling Manager, follow
these steps:
1.
Go to the Sold or Unsold Listings by clicking
the links in the Manage Listings box on the left
of the page.
2.
Once you’re on the page, select an item to relist
by clicking the check box next to its record
number.
You may select any or all of the items listed on
the page.
3.
Once you have selected all the items that you
want to relist, click the Sell Similar button.
You will be taken to the Relist Multiple Items
page.
4.
Review all the items listed (along with the fees
being charged) and submit the items by click-
ing the Submit Listing button.

takes action, that is, buys the item or e-mails you
that he is not interested (and you close the Second
Chance offer — just like an auction), you can make
another offer to a different underbidder. You can fol-
low this process on down the list of underbidders
for up to 60 days.
You do not necessarily have to make an offer to an
underbidder if you are not comfortable with that
person’s feedback. It’s up to you to which bidder
you make offers.
The link to make a Second Chance offer (look at
Figure 12-5 to view the link on the My eBay page; a
similar link appears in Selling Manager) appears only
when an auction has more than one bidder.
• Figure 12-5: The decision-making page for making a
Second Chance offer.
Relisting from Your “Item 
Did Not Sell” Notices
When an item doesn’t sell, eBay sends you an e-mail
notice, as you can see in Figure 12-6. Whenever I get
one, my mind reads it as: Dear Big Loser, your item
didn’t sell. Nyah, nyah!
Figure 12-4 shows a portion of the Relist Multiple
Items page that includes a complete review of the
details of each of your items. If you proceed, they will
be relisted exactly as you had them listed before. On
the bottom of this page, eBay gives you a recap of all
relisting fees.
• Figure 12-4: Relisting several items at once from Selling
Manager.
Making a Second Chance Offer
When you have multiples of an item and your final
bid amount exceeded your target price, you can feel
free to make offers to underbidders to buy the same
item for their high bid. You can also make a Second
Chance offer if the winning bidder does not come
through with the payment.
This is a perfectly eBay-legal way to make a second
sale. Best of all? eBay doesn’t charge you a second
listing fee for your offer. You just pay a Final Value
fee if the bidder accepts your offer.
Second Chance offers may be offered to underbid-
ders, for a prescribed time period — 1, 3, 5, or 7
days. The underbidder has the opportunity to take
you up on the offer or pass. When the underbidder

click to relist your item instantaneously. It’s

Technique
Tracking Your
Auction Action
S
ellers who post hundreds (not to mention those who post thousands)
of auctions each week barely have time to breathe, much less to twid-
dle around checking to see whether their items have snagged two
more bids. They care about listing auctions, closing out auctions, getting
paid, and getting the product out the door.
Now that you’ve heard how the big guys think, let’s start small. Many eBay
sellers sell part-time. Observing the progress of their auctions is part of the
fun, and also serious business when they rely on the money they earn from
auctions as a regular form of income. Using eBay’s tools — such as the
Selling page of My eBay, Selling Manager, and Selling Manager Pro — can
help the part-time (and even full-time) seller keep track of all the transac-
tions they’re juggling on eBay.
Selling Manager Pro adds many additional options for post-auction
management and inventory.
Using My eBay to Manage Your Listings
Start with baby steps (the best way to start) by visiting the Selling tab of
My eBay. For the newbie seller, the tools on the Items I’m Selling page
work great. They’re simple and get right to the point.
The small seller can use the Items I’m Selling page in combination
with the Sell Your Item form for individual listings and these should
be sufficient for managing listings.
For example, Figure 13-1 shows the Items I’m Selling page of My eBay.
This feature alone gives you quite a bit of information you can use to
track your auctions as they happen.

The Items I’m Selling page uses a color code
that helps you quickly see what’s going on. If
the current price listed for an auction appears
in green, a bid has been placed on the item. If
it’s red, there have been no bids.
• Figure 13-1: The Items I’m Selling page.

On the Items I’m Selling page, you can view details
for your active listings, including:

Links for listings. Each listing has clickable links
you can use to go instantly to an item page.

Item Number. Just in case you need an item
number to contact a bidder or send auction
information to a friend, you’ll find the item num-
ber here.

Current Price. This may be the starting price of
your item (if you have no bids) or the current
price based on bids received.

Reserve Price. This is a very handy feature that
reminds you of the reserve price that you’ve set
on an item. There’s nowhere else to check this; if
you forget to write it down when you’re listing
the auction, here it is.

Quantity Available. Here’s where you can see
how many of this item are still available for pur-
chase on the site. As you can see in Figure 13-1,
when a eBay Store item is listed, this feature will
show you how many are left and the original
quantity you listed.

# of Bids. When you see that the price is rising
on an item, check out this column to see how
many bids have been placed to date.

Start Date. This is the date the listing was posted
on eBay.

End Date. This is the date when the listing will
end.

Time Left. In this column, you can check how
much time is left (to the minute) in your listing.

Manage Your Listing. This is the handiest col-
umn of all. Here, you have a link that lets you
relist a similar item. This is particularly handy if
you use a template and want to use it again for
another item. This link brings you to the Sell
Your Item form where you can change anything
about the listing that you wish and quickly list it.
In the case of an eBay Store item, the Manage
Your Listing feature also permits you to end a
Good Till Cancelled (GTC) listing.
On the bottom of your Items I’m Selling listing is a
handy recap of all your offerings, as shown in Fig-
ure 13-2. The good part about this summary is that
the tally gives you the current bottom line of your
items for sale.
• Figure 13-2: Tote board that summarizes my eBay selling
activity.
If you have an eBay Store, the Items I’m Selling
tally won’t include revenue for store items that
have sold. If you have an eBay Store, I strongly
recommend using Selling Manager.

to start investing in some tools to keep your busi-
ness professional.
The first tool that can help smooth your transition
makes the process of running eBay auctions and
sales consistent — Selling Manager.
Technique 11 gets farther into eBay’s free Turbo
Lister program (it gets your items on the site without
having to go through the slow, sometimes-torturous
Sell Your Item form). As with Turbo Lister, Selling
Manager is a suite of tools for managing your selling
business from any computer (as long as it has an
Internet connection). eBay gives you 30 days to try
out the service for free, thereafter charging you
$4.99 per month. (Believe me, the time that Selling
Manager will save you is well worth the fee.)
I’ve run well over 60 auctions in a single
month, successfully managing them with
Selling Manager. I use it, along with PayPal’s
tools and QuickBooks (see Technique 47 for
more about this method). This approach pro-
vides a professional solution for my medium-
size eBay business.
First glimpse of Selling Manager
To download your free Selling Manager trial pro-
gram, follow these steps:
1.
Click the Site Map link in the eBay Navigation
Bar at the top of every eBay page.
2.
In the first column of the Site Map, under
the Sell heading, click the link for “Selling
Manager.”
3.
Read the information on the Selling Manager
hub page and click the Subscribe Now link.
You’re now subscribed to your 30-day free trial. If
you continue using Selling Manager, eBay will add
the additional $4.99 fee to your monthly bill. eBay
will automatically populate Selling Manager for you
with your information from the My eBay Selling tab.
The Selling tab will change to Selling Manager when
it’s all set up.
Sold items
There’s also an area where your sold items appear,
called (coincidentally) Items I’ve Sold. When the sell-
ing cycle is over and someone has purchased an item,
it shows up here. I’ll cover the tools included here in
Part IV, which covers after-the-auction business.
Unsold items
Sob. Sadly, there’s an area that lists items that just
didn’t pique the interest of eBay shoppers — at least
this week. (Remember, there’s always another sell-
ing day on eBay.) Your unsold items appear as in
Figure 13-3.
• Figure 13-3: Your Unsold Items listings.
From here, for up to 30 days, you can click the Relist
link to relist an item on the site.
If your unsold item sells on the second (repeat)
listing, eBay refunds your listing fee for the
originally unsold item.
Ramping Up with 
Selling Manager
Once the selling bug has bitten you, it’s a natural
transition to go from listing a few items a month to
fifty or more. That means, dear reader, that you are
now officially running an eBay business.
Congratulations!
There’s a good and a bad side to this. The good is
that you’re making considerably more cash than you
did before hooking up with eBay. The bad? It’s time

Ramping Up with Selling Manager
93
With Selling Manager, you can click the tab to view a
summary of all your auction activities. Figure 13-4
shows my current Selling Manager Summary page.
• Figure 13-4: My Selling Manager Summary page.
The Summary page lists at-a-glance statistics so I
can see what’s going on with my sales quickly, at any
time — from any computer. Links to other pages in
the Selling Manager tool are also included.
If you plan to exceed 75 transactions a month,
consider using Selling Manager Pro; it has bulk
feedback and bulk invoice-printing features or
a third-party solution. See Technique 60 for
information on third-party management tools.
Pending Listings
The Pending Listings link on the Summary page
takes you to any auction, fixed-price, or store listing
you’ve sent to eBay through Turbo Lister (or listed
on the Sell Your Item page) and scheduled for a later
starting date or time. You can also view these pend-
ing listings through links on the Summary page that
narrow them down to Listings starting within the next
hour and Listings starting within the next day.
When you enter the Pending Listings area by clicking
Pending Listings from the Summary page, you can go
directly to the listing shown in Figure 13-5. If you
want to promote your listing-to-be in a banner ad (or
create a link to it from elsewhere on the Internet),
you can do so using the URL of the pending listing.
See Part IX for more information on promoting your
eBay business.
• Figure 13-5: What an auction looks like before it starts.
From the Pending Listing page, you can confirm all
information about the sale, as well as make any
changes to the listing or to the scheduling time.
Active Listings
Click the Active Listings link on the Summary page,
and you can observe the bidding action just as you
can from the My eBay Selling page. The color-coding
that indicates bidding activity is the same as on the
My eBay Selling page, and your listings are accessi-
ble with a click of your mouse.
You have the option to show only auctions, store
listings, or fixed-price items on the Active Listings
page. You can also search your own listings by key-
word or item number.
For more about active listings, visit the
Summary page, which includes links to items
ending within the hour and those ending
within the next 24 hours.

download this information to your computer. There
are good records here; download them and keep
them. See Part VIII for more on what you can do
with them.
Seller Tools
The Seller Tools box is on the left side of the Summary
page. It’s a powerful group of links that allow you
to download and export your sales history to your
computer. There’s also a quick link to PayPal, a link
to the Selling Manager Discussion Board, a link to My
eBay Store, and a link to the good old My eBay Selling
page — in case you get nostalgic for the old, pre-
Selling Manager days.
Cross-Promotions
If you have an eBay Store, you may notice that the
Cross-Promotions area (which you access from the
box to the right of your Summary information) has a
great many links. Here is where you can set up a mer-
chandising bar that shows selected items you have
up for sale on each item page when it’s viewed by
the prospective buyer.
I have extra links in this area because I have an eBay
Store; when you have an eBay Store, you can control
which items go into the merchandising bar at the
bottom of the description of your items. (You can
see a sample merchandising bar in Figure 13-6.)
• Figure 13-6: Seller’s merchandising bar that appears at
the bottom of all item listings.
Sold Listings
The Sold Listings feature (which you get to by click-
ing the link on the Summary page) is where Selling
Manager really shines. You’ll find quite a few links
here, including these:

Awaiting Payment: This is where items that have
been won or bought are listed before a payment
is made.

Awaiting Payment, Items that Are Eligible for
Non-Paying Bidder Alerts: Items that are await-
ing payment are listed when they become eligi-
ble for you to file a Non-Paying Bidder Alert. This
happens when 7 days have passed without a pay-
ment being received.

Paid and Ready to Ship: If you input the fact
that a buyer has sent payment, or if the buyer
pays via PayPal, the transaction automatically
moves to this category.

Paid and Ready for Feedback: Once an item is
paid for, a reference to it appears here so you
can keep track of the feedback you need to leave.

Paid and Shipped: These are (you guessed it)
items for which the buyer has paid, and you’ve
indicated on the transaction record that you
shipped the item.

Unpaid and Eligible for Final Value Fee Credit:
This is the sad category where buyers from the
Non-Paying Bidder column go if, after all your
attempts to get action, they have not responded
and sent payment. (If they don’t cough up within
10 days after you file a Non-Paying Bidder Alert,
the listing moves to this category automatically.)
If you want to see just how useful these links can be,
check out Part IV, where I cover the handling end of
the auction business.

Boosting Sales
through Dynamic
Research
F
rom my background in advertising, I know that good-quality research
can make the difference in whether a business endeavor is a success
or a failure. In my books and lectures, I always advocate the necessity
of doing at least the minimal research on any item’s eBay availably and cur-
rent selling pricing. (See Technique 4 for how to do this research.)
I also recommend using certain advanced counters (those that break
down Web page visits to hours and days, rather than showing only
totals), because such tools tell you more than the number of people who
click on your page — that number alone doesn’t tell you much. Wouldn’t
it be nice to know, not only how many people visited your listing, but
what page sent them there and what city they come from? Wouldn’t it
be nice to have more data about the people who visit your listings?
The problem with gathering this kind of information is that the coding and
programming involved is probably beyond the skill set of even the top-
level eBay sellers. After all, they’re merchants, not computer programmers.
In this technique, I tell you about an online service — ViewTracker — that
gives you all the research you can use. And you get the info just by putting
a small bit code (which this service supplies) into your listings. Every time
someone visits your auctions, the code that you’ve embedded sends your
online account definitive information about your visitor — in real time.
Best of all, this information — while important for your sales efforts —
remains noninvasive for your potential customers. For example, you may
find out the timeslots and keywords used by your listing visitors, but you
find out nothing that compromises their identities.
The information service presented in this technique doesn’t turn your
computer into a data-mining robot. It merely gives you the informa-
tion that is available to every Web site on the Internet. That is, it gives
you information such as geographic location, which follows the IP
address of all eBay users who visit your listings. This service is not an
invasion of privacy (like the data-mining cookies explained in the
sidebar “Flushing out the moles”).

You will also find out (I just love this!) which key-
words the browser was using when they came to
your listing. This information is crucial when writing
titles — and planning keyword campaigns (see Part
IX for more info on how to build business that way).
Here’s a partial list of the type of data you can get by
using the ViewTracker system:

Sequential number of the visitor. Is this the 19th
visitor or the 104th — and will this person come
back again?

Date and time the visitor arrived at your auction.

Visitor’s IP address. By clicking the IP address
in the Sellathon screen, you can see only those
visits originating from this IP address.

What City, State, and Country your visitor is from.

Whether the Reserve Price was met when the
visitor arrived.

When the item receives a bid (and how many
have been placed to that moment).

Whether the current visitor is the high bidder, a
bidder who has been outbid, or no bidder at all.

Whether the visitor has chosen to watch this list-
ing in his or her My eBay page.

Whether the visitor browsed a category,
searched a category, searched all of eBay, used
eBay’s Product Finder Utility, came from “See
Seller’s Other Items,” or some other page.
 If the visitors were browsing, which category
were they browsing when they clicked into
your listing?
 If searching, what search terms did they use
to find your item?
 If they were searching when they came upon
your item, did visitor search Titles Only or
Titles and Descriptions?

Did the user elect to view Auctions Only, Buy It
Now, or both?
Flushing out the moles
There’s no place to hide on the Internet: Every one of your
keystrokes and visits to Web sites can be traced back to
you. There’s big money in this data as well. If you’ve ever
used a program like Spybot Search & Destroy (a program
that finds data-mining programs that have been placed on
your computer when you visit certain Web sites), you know
how much more data sites want about their visitors. My
daughter downloaded the free version of Spybot and
found 632 data-mining cookies slowing down her com-
puter! Spybot can be downloaded for free from many sites,
just google Spybot to find it.
Companies like Mediaplex and DoubleClick make a living
by placing cookies on your computer as you browse the
Internet. These cookies follow your browsing trail and
report your comings and goings to their motherships.
Mediaplex and DoubleClick sell that information to the big
guys so they can better figure out who their customers are.
If you never want Mediaplex to track your Internet brows-
ing, go to

Knowing What You Get from
Sellathon™ViewTracker™
If I have ever thought I’d found eBay’s “killer app,”
ViewTracker from Sellathon is it — because it
answers the most popular questions I’m asked by
eBay sellers. Before ViewTracker, when trying to fig-
ure out the exact time and day to end an auction,
you had to do a considerable amount of research by
running test auctions on the eBay site. Now you can
follow the “body clocks” of your buyers and find out
when they search for your type of item.

Checking out Your Data
97

Did the user refine his or her searches using 
specific parameters? These include Show/Hide
pictures, Sellers that accept PayPal, Price Range,
International Availability, Regional Searching,
Gallery View, and Show Gift Items.

Was there a preference in the way the user sorted
his or her search results? Did they search items
from High Price to Low Price?
Amazing stuff, eh? By applying the information from
ViewTracker, you can change tactics to help your lit-
tle business grow into a big one. You’ll be able to
customize your items to match your very own eBay
market.
Setting up your account is painless. After you
give your contact information to Sellathon (and
make up a new User ID and password for the
site), you will be presented with a small amount
of code to add to your listing’s description. It’s
that easy.
Checking Out Your Data
In this section, I show you a portion of the data
screens from my ViewTracker account. But keep one
thing in mind. I’ve been busy writing this book, so I
haven’t had much time to list tons of items on eBay.
The few I have listed (I have to keep up my status as
a PowerSeller!) will give you a good idea of what
you’ll see.
When you first log onto ViewTracker, you’ll be pre-
sented with your General (combined items) page.
Here you’ll see a couple of statistics. Keep in mind
that ViewTracker constantly tracks your items in
real time, so the data may change by the minute as
you’re changing screens within the program!
After you log in to your account, you see a mini-graph
at the top of every page, as shown in Figure 14-1. This
shows you a quick graphic snapshot of your last 24
hours total up-to-the-minute hit counts.
• Figure 14-1: A 24 Hour snapshot of my hits.
In the center you see a composite of all your items
(as in Figure 14-2) — auctions with bids at the top,
and auctions being watched by prospective buyers
(on their My eBay page) at the bottom.
Here you’ll see the total value of all bids placed on
your auctions, the number of people watching your
items, the average visits per auction, and the total
hits on all your items.
• Figure 14-2: ViewTracker’s General composite screen.
On the left side of your page, you’ll also see some
other stats. One will be your Live Auction Stats. Take
a look at my instant stats in Figure 14-3.
• Figure 14-3: Live auction stats.

Technique 14: Boosting Sales through Dynamic Research
98
The next graph you access is the most active day of
the week. Figure 14-5 is a portion of the composite
report for all my auctions. Think how valuable this
data would be when you analyze data from auctions
from a similar category. For example, golf equip-
ment, DVD, women’s apparel — you get the picture.
Remember, this data covers all my listings; this isn’t
for one particular item (although you can get that
data as well).
• Figure 14-5: Most active days for my items.
I just love this next chart. Figure 14-6 shows you the
way people came to my auctions. This is the best
way to see whether things you’ve been doing to
boost sales is really working for you. For example,
are you taking the best advantage of targeting your
cross-promotions? Does your Web site send people
to your eBay Listings?
One sure thing you can glean from viewing
the Way Visitors Found Your Auction chart in
Figure 14-6: The entries labeled View Seller’s
Other Items and Cross Promotion really indi-
cate that cross promoting your merchandise
works. See Technique 8 for information on
using cross promoting and other selling strate-
gies to your advantage.
You’ll also have folders on the left, which will have
your live and expired auctions. You can click links
here to get general information on all your auctions,
or click the folder to view information on individual
items. You can get data on all your items consolidated
together, or individual information for each listing.
Although I don’t really want to give away any of my
deep dark secrets, I can show you a few screens of
data from my expired (closed items) so you know
what to look for.
The first shows the most active time of the day for
my auctions by hits. I do have to warn you ahead of
time that I’ve been doing a lot of TV and radio these
days promoting my books — and if I’m lucky, people
log on to eBay and look for my books after they’ve
seen me. That said, realize that the numbers in
Figure 14-4 will definitely be skewed.
• Figure 14-4: My most active hits by the hour.

Getting Additional Information from Your Listings

This figure is only a portion of the information that
appears on the chart. You’ll have a complete picture
of where all your visitors come from.
• Figure 14-6: How people found my items.
There are other data graphs that you’ll see, but the
very best is the Top Search Terms Used to find your
items. This chart will give you definitive data so
you’ll know which keywords to include in your titles.
(Sorry, I’d love to show you my top keywords, but
that’s a secret! When you work up a list of your own,
you’ll know exactly where I’m coming from.)
Getting Additional Information
from Your Listings
With ViewTracker, you can also view the data for
individual listings. Figure 14-7 shows you the data
from a very quick auction that ended with a Buy It
Now transaction. The data collected and shown here
is combined with data from other listings to make up
the charts and statistics shown in this technique’s
other figures.
• Figure 14-7: ViewTracker info for a single listing.
Note a few things:

IP Address: You don’t get the complete IP
address of the visitor for privacy, but it can
show you how many times the same person has
visited your listing.

Question Mark: If you click the question mark,
you will get a pop-up window with the city and
state of your visitor.

Who: ViewTracker has unique graphic icons to
signify different types of visitors. If you click the
icon, it will tell you what it signifies. The ones in
the figure happen to be: me (so I can see when I
go to one of my items), that someone has won
the item, and that someone is watching the item
in his or her My eBay page.

Method of arrival: Here’s where you can tell
whether your individual promotions are working.
There’s a whole lot more to this amazing program.
The cost for the program starts at $49.95 a year for a
small time eBay seller (like me). For a free trial, go to

trial to see what’s really happening in your auctions.

Getting Great
Images for eBay
P
hotography has always been a passion for me. The hobby led me
(at the age of 10) from developing film in a tiny storage-closet dark-
room through my first side-advertising job for a camera store (yes,
I was always a moonlighter) to a great professional gig taking photo-
graphs of NASCAR auto racing for magazines and newspapers. Although
my passion for photography remains unchanged, I learned where to
draw the line when exercising my photography skills.
Specifically, when it came to taking pictures for retailer’s catalogs, I left
that job to an experienced professional. Making merchandise look good
is an art. The catalog photographer knows just what it takes to get the
lighting perfect, play down flaws in the merchandise, and give everything
the right look within a few bracketed snaps.
By working with professional catalog photographers for over ten years,
I picked up some tricks for setting up the pictures, buffing up the mer-
chandise, and making everything look picture-perfect. In this technique,
I pass on the tips and shortcuts to you. For example, you find out how to
select a camera and take pictures that really sell your items. Use these
ideas to take great pictures that flatter your merchandise and help
you sell!
Choosing Your Digital Camera
The camera you use for eBay is a very personal choice. Would-be big-
time sellers, starting out in an eBay business (with no experience on the
site) usually go out and buy the most expensive digital camera they can
find. Maybe having lots of megapixels is a macho thing, but a camera
with a bunch of megapixels is the last thing you need for eBay images.
For more information on the importance (or not) of megapixels, see
Technique 18.
Keep these two characteristics in mind when looking for a camera:
convenience and optical zoom. Pick a camera that’s easy to use and
find accessories for. Also, make sure that the optical zoom capabilities
will help you capture the level of detail that your merchandise requires.

cards come in different sizes and hold from 16MB
to 1GB worth of memory capacity.

SmartMedia cards: A SmartMedia card is slightly
smaller than a Compact Flash card but is very
thin and has no plastic outer case. It is only used
in a few brands of digital cameras (such as
Olympus). SmartMedia cards come in different
data sizes from 8MB to 128MB.

Memory Stick: A tiny media card that is about
the size of piece of chewing gum and as long as
an AA battery. The Memory Stick is a Sony device
and is used in most Sony products. Memory
Sticks now hold as much as 2GB of memory. One
of the great things about a Memory Stick is that
it can be used in numerous devices besides cam-
eras, including PCs and video recorders.

Mini CD, CD/RW, and DVD: These mini optical
discs hold tons of pictures for eBay — 185MB
worth. You can read them right in your com-
puter’s CD or DVD reader. You’ll notice that
there’s a smaller round indentation on the disc
platter. This is to hold the mini format.
You may find that you use more than one
type of medium with your digital camera. And
because you can record any type of digital
data on these removable media, you may find
other uses for them. For example, sometimes
when I want to back up files or move larger
files, I copy them onto one of my 128MB
SmartMedia cards in the reader attached to
my desktop computer and plug the card into
the PCMCIA adapter on my laptop.
Battery life and bargain shopping
When you’re picking out your camera, be sure to
check into the length of time the camera’s battery
will hold a charge. The last thing you want to do is
run out of juice at the wrong moment. Consider the
following:

Look for a camera battery with at least three
hours of photo-taking time.

Keep a spare battery on hand.
When shopping for your camera, find one with the
highest optical zoom that you can afford. Optical
zoom is magnified by the camera’s lens — using the
camera’s internal optics to produce a vivid picture.
Digital zoom is valuable with a camcorder when
shooting moving pictures, as the eye can’t focus on
the fuzzy results as easily. When your camera uses
digital zoom, it does the same thing as enlarging a
picture in photo editing software. The camera will
center the focus over half the focal plane and will
use software interpolation to enlarge the picture.
This will make your image slightly fuzzy.
Choosing digital media — You can
have more than one
After you decide on an easy-to-use camera with the
highest optical zoom you can get, think about how
to get those pictures from the camera to your
computer.
Most cameras can hard-wire connect to your PC with
a USB cable, and many sellers are happy with that
type of connection, while others don’t like a tethered
experience. Cameras also have removable media.
For some media, you need a media reader attached
to your computer — it’s like a teeny disk drive for
the little cards.
Here’s a starter list of the removable storage media
currently available:

Floppy disks: Sony has a line of Mavica cameras
that save images to a regular 31⁄2-inch floppy disk.
After taking your pictures, you just remove the
floppy and put it in your A: drive. Voila! The pic-
tures are in your computer. You can then copy
the images to a directory on your hard drive for
cropping and uploading.

CompactFlash memory card: This is a small
medium, slightly smaller than a matchbook. You
insert it into a media reader to transfer the data
into your computer. You can buy a new USB
reader on eBay for as little as $5.00. There are also
readers for a laptop’s PCMCIA slot. CompactFlash

Getting Ready to Take Your Best Shot

I keep a Lithium CR-V3 battery in my purse so I’ll
be prepared if my camera battery runs low while
I’m on the road — they seem to last forever!

Invest in a charger and rechargeable batteries.
I have a rechargeable backup battery for my
Sony Mavica FD92 camera in the office. These
batteries last a long time and are worth the cost
of investment.
Budget is also a factor. But luckily, as a savvy eBay
shopper, you can find deals on lower resolution (3
megapixels or less) cameras on eBay. When the rest
of the world is upgrading to mucho megapixels, they
sell their perfectly good low-resolution cameras on
eBay for about $150. You can be right there to snap
up the deals!
Scanning for Images
Do you plan to sell flat items (such as autographs,
stamps, books, or documents) on eBay? If so, you can
scan your images on a flatbed scanner. Today’s scan-
ners are reasonably priced and available as “all-in-
ones” that combine copier, fax, printer, and scanner.
When you scan images for eBay, remember to
keep the resolution relatively low so the image
loads fast. You can set your scanner to the
lowest resolution for Web images, no more
than 96 dpi.
If you’ve got three-dimensional items, you can lay
them on top of the scanner to get an image. Cover the
area around the item with a white T-shirt to get good
light reflection without a weird shady background.
Getting Ready to Take
Your Best Shot
Aside from setting up a pretty picture, as a profes-
sional seller, you have a couple of other things to
consider.

Lighting. Be sure you have sufficient lighting for
your images. If you’re photographing small
items, you can successfully use an Ott-Lite or the
less expensive version made by Cloud Dome as
in Figure 15-1. This light is even good enough for
jewelry photography as the bulb is a full-
spectrum daylight 5000K fluorescent tube. This
same light temperature is used where precision
is required, such as in diamond grading.
• Figure 15-1: A folding diamond-grading-quality light.
The color temperature of a light is the num-
ber given to a lighting condition, which ranges
from 2500 — 7800K. The K after the number
signifies the use of a scale called Kelvin tem-
perature range. Actual daylight color tempera-
ture is about 5500K, and it’s best to get your
lighting as close to that as you can. Using a
bulb with a daylight number is important
because it’s a pure neutral, which means that
it throws no blue or yellow cast on your
images.

lectibles, big consumer items, and mannequins

best. If you can adjust the white balance, do so.
Manufacturers preset different settings on their
cameras. The list of options can include settings
for incandescent lights, twilight, fluorescent lights,
outdoor, indoor, or shade. All these lighting situa-
tions have different “color temperatures.”
It’s worthwhile to take the time to play with the
various white-balance settings of your camera in
the different places where you normally photo-
graph eBay merchandise. Make notes on settings
that give you the truest colors in your digital
images.
Trudging through the eBay
Gallery of Horrors
This section shows you a bunch of big-time don’ts.
We’ve seen images like these all over eBay at one
time or another. I haven’t duplicated it here, but
there’s the infamous problem of getting your image
(with camera in hand) reflected in a mirror, large sil-
ver piece, or other reflecting surface. One creative
seller said in her auction, “Husband with camera not
included.” Avoid getting yourself in the photo by
shooting your pictures from an angle. If you see your
reflection in the item, move and try again.
Mistake #1
Figure 15-3 shows a nice item, but the picture suffers
from two major flaws:

A glare from the camera’s flash shows in the
cellophane on the item. This can be avoided by
turning the item slightly at an angle so that the
flash doesn’t give off such a bright glare.

The price sticker is smack on the front of the
item. Often you’ll buy things for resale that have
stickers. Be a pro — use a commercial “undo”
product to remove stickers. It removes the stick-
ers cleanly and leaves no residue.
way to get proper lighting is to use a pair of
floodlights on adjustable tripod stands. (See
Figure 15-2.) I use a pair of those with halogen
(white light) bulbs in them. Check my Web site,
www.coolebaytools.com for updates on new
gadgets for eBay photography.

Macro adjustment: Most digital cameras have a
macro setting for shooting magnified close-ups.
Usually, the macro mode can focus (depending
on the camera) as close as 1 inch and as far away
as 10 inches. A small flower icon in the camera’s
menu normally signifies the macro setting.
The average camera’s focal length (focus range)
is from 3 feet to infinity. If you have a camera that
says the macro focus range is set at 5.1 inches, it
means you can’t focus it clearly on an object any
closer than 5.1 inches.
Cameras have presets for different focal ranges,
and they’re usually set in meters. (There’s an
m following the focus range number.) Just so
you won’t forget, a meter is approximately 3
feet in distance.

White balance: This is a pretty tricky feature.

Mistake #2
What a cute teddy — but what are we selling here?
Figure 15-4 shows a common eBay seller mistake.
Don’t dress your picture with props to decorate the
scene. Your photo should be a crisp, clean image of
the product you’re selling, and only that.
• Figure 15-4: And you’re selling what?
Mistake #3
I never knew how much colorful upholstery people
had in their homes. I could find only a zebra print
in mine (see Figure 15-5), but I’ve seen items pho-
tographed on plaid, floral, and striped fabrics. It’s
distracting from your item. Don’t do it.
• Figure 15-5: Nice sofa!
Mistake #4
I’m sure the item shown in Figure 15-6 is very desir-
able, but who can make that judgment without see-
ing the item? Not to put too fine a point on it: Take
the item out of the box. If the box is a crucial part of
the deal (as in collectibles), be sure to mention that
the box is included in the sale.

Technique 15: Getting Great Images for eBay
108
Mistake #5
Don’t make the mistake shown in Figure 15-7. Can
you say close-up? Use the zoom on your camera to
fill the frame with a full picture of your item. Draw
your camera close to the item so the prospective
customer can actually see some detail. Don’t just
rely on cropping the picture in an image-editing
program; that only makes the image smaller. 
• Figure 15-7: Pay no attention to the object on the carpet.
If you can’t open the box without ruining the value of
the item, pull in for a macro close-up. When you have
a quantity of the item, bite the bullet and open one
up. A good picture gets you higher bids, and perhaps
that loss of one item will be made up by the higher
bids on the sales with good pictures.

Prepping and
Photographing
Clothing
P
hotographing apparel for eBay is not the fashionista type of fashion
photography. It’s quick and dirty. The (one) rule goes like this: Take
the best picture you can and move on to the next item so that you
can hurry up and list all items for sale on eBay. Period. I hate to admit it,
but there were times when we were shooting pictures for major catalogs
that we worked in the same way.
Even though I’ve just said there’s only one rule, I also know that taking
the best picture involves a bit of preparation on your part. Figure 16-1
shows the results of an eBay search for the keyword dress. Which of
these items for sale look better — the items laid out on the floor or those
on a mannequin or model? There’s a designer dress in this search that
would have probably sold for twice the amount if it had been on a man-
nequin! When women are searching for dresses, using a gallery picture is
de rigueur when you want to draw attention to your item and set it apart
from thousands of others.

tip-top shape, you’ll want to keep it that way.
Hanging the merchandise on a garment rack (as
in Figure 16-2) keeps it fresh-looking so it looks
great when you’re ready to ship.


Steamer: Retail stores, clothing manufacturers,
and drycleaners all use steamers. Why? Because
steaming the garment with a steam wand is kinder
to the fabric and takes out wrinkles in a hurry.
Steam penetrates the fabric (not crushing it, as
does ironing) and seems to make the fabric look
better than before.
Steaming is also five times faster than ironing
(and not as backbreaking) so that’s why it’s
truly the professional’s choice. Steaming 
garments is a breeze; see for yourself in 
Figure 16-3.
A hand-held travel steamer will work for beginners
who sell one or two apparel items a month. While
you can steam a garment with a professional-style
steamer in a minute or two, you might have to
work on a garment with a travel steamer for 
15 minutes. If you’re thinking about selling a 
One of the worst ways to photograph clothing
is on a tabletop or folded on the floor. If you’ve
seen eBay auctions featuring clothing folded on
a table, you know how you squinted to figure
out what you were looking at. Not only does
the camera miss essential details in the folded
items, but it also misses the opportunity to
show off the clothing in all its glory — as worn
by a person. To get the highest bids, give your
clothing an authentic, lifelike appearance.
Apparel photography can be tricky by all measures,
especially when you don’t have a model. Using a
model is a great idea if you have plenty of time to
spare. When you work with a model (even if it’s your
daughter or girlfriend) you’ll have to take many
shots of them wearing the same item, because you
want the model to look as good as the clothing and
vice versa. Not a timesaver.
What’s the best way to shoot fashion for eBay?
Assembly line. Henry Ford had it right. Have every-
thing assembled in one area and the process can go
smoothly and quickly. In this technique, I tell you
about how to prepare your studio, your props, and
your clothing to get the best picture for the least
effort. And best of all, the time you spend prepar-
ing the clothes to photograph also makes them 
customer-ready. Now, there’s a timesaver!
Cleaning and Pressing
Essentials
Before you photograph your clothing, make sure
that the clothing itself imparts the image you want
your buyers to see. For example, remove any loose
threads and lint that has accumulated on the fabric.
Have the following items handy to help you with the
cleaning and pressing chores:


dise from the carton they were shipped to you
in, they can look pretty ragged. Also, if you’ve

• Figure 16-3: Steaming with my Jiffy for eBay!
Steaming hot tips
Or is it tips for hot steaming? In either case, keep these few
tips in mind when steaming the clothes you sell on eBay:

Always keep the steam head in an upright position so
that the condensation inside the hose drains back into
the steamer.

Run the steam head lightly down the fabric.

Don’t let the steam head come directly in contact with
velvet or silk, or it may spot the fabric.

Steam velvet (or any fabric with a pile) from the
reverse side.

Hang pants by the cuff when steaming.

Heavy fabrics may do better by steaming from the
underside of the fabric.

When you’re through steaming your clothes for eBay,
try steaming your mattresses and furniture. Steaming
has been shown to kill a majority of dust mites and
their accompanying nastiness.
I use a Jiffy Steamer that I’ve had for quite a
while. (I even bought it on eBay and got a great
deal.) It’s the same kind they use in retail stores,
only slightly smaller.

Dryel: A popular, reasonably priced home dry-
cleaning product you use in your dryer. Dryel
can be used with almost any type of garment (be
sure to double-check on the packaging before
you use it on an item). After going through a
Dryel treatment, the clothes will come out of
the dryer sweet and clean. The starter kit even
comes with a spot remover. You can buy Dryel
at your local supermarket.
According to eBay rules, all used clothing must
be cleaned before it is sold on the site. Even if
the vintage garment you have up for sale is
clean, it can always benefit by a roll around in
the dryer with Dryel. New garments, too, benefit;
Dryel removes any smells that have clung to the
garment during its travels.

Spot cleaners: I recommend you have them and
use them only if you know what you’re doing.
There are some really great ones out there that
will remove a small spot, but you’d best practice
on items that you’re not selling before using
those products.

Photographing fashion right takes a little time, but
as they say, the right tools make any project easier.
Here’s a list of some items you need when photo-
graphing clothing:

Mannequin body double. Since we don’t want to
deal with supermodels and their requirements
for non-fat vanilla lattes, we’ve got to find some-
one who will model the garments and not give us
any grief. Figure 16-4 pictures my mannequin

lots of dresses on eBay for me.

find molded styrene forms on eBay for as little
as $20. If you decide to stay in the apparel
vending business, you can always upgrade to
a full-size mannequin.
 Dressmaker’s adjustable form. You can also
use a dressmaker’s form to model your eBay
clothing. The best part about using these is
that you can adjust the size of the body to fit
your clothing. You can often find new (or —
even better — good-condition used) ones on
eBay for under $100.

Vertical photo lights on stands. To light your
merchandise, you’ll do best to invest in some
floodlights. You don’t have to spend a mint, but
as you’ll see when you start taking pictures, the
little flash on your camera isn’t accentuating the
good parts of your apparel.
You may want to stop the flash on your camera
from going off altogether when you take pictures
of clothes, because too much light coming from
the front will wash out the detail in the fabric.
Place the clothing to be photographed on the
mannequin in the middle of your studio area.
Situate each floodlight to either side and closer
to the camera than the mannequin. Your setup
will be a V-shape, with your mannequin at the
point, your floodlights at the top of each V-side,
and you holding the camera (or using a tripod)
in the middle at the top of the V.
Adjust the distance that you place your lights
until you get a good look to the clothes. Be
sure to tilt the light heads to pick up extra
detail in the clothing.

Clothespins. Before you think I’m crazy, I’ll have
you know that clothespins were used in almost
every apparel photo that I’ve participated in.
Think about it, the clothing you’re selling will
come in different sizes and may not always hang
right on your mannequin.
• Figure 16-4: Midge modeling a vintage fur (photo was
cropped prior to listing).
Full-body mannequins can be purchased on eBay
for about $200. I bought Midge from a local store
that was updating mannequins. Prior to making
my purchase, I asked a few stores whether they’d
be selling old mannequins, and I struck gold. You
can do that too. Major department stores often
liquidate their display merchandise in auctions;
so keep your eyes peeled for auctions of store
fixtures to show up in your local newspaper.
Keep in mind that you needn’t spend a mint on a
brand-new model. If your mannequin is used and
has a few paint chips — so what? Don’t we all?
The entire purpose of having a mannequin is to
display what clothing looks like on a lovely body;
a used mannequin works just fine.
Less expensive alternatives to a mannequin are
 Molded body form. Before you decide to
jump in with both feet, you might want to try
using a hanging body form. These are molded
torsos that have a hanger at the top. You can

To fit your clothing on the mannequin, use
clothespins to take up any slack in the garment
(be sure to place the clothespins where the cam-
era won’t see them). You’ll get a much better
look to the outfit. Figure 16-5 shows Midge (a size
6, you know) in a size-10 dress that I sold on
eBay. Va-va-voom!

Technique
Photographing the
Tuff Stuff: Coins
and Jewelry
I
’ve been selling on eBay since 1997 — and I thought I was pretty good
at showing off and selling my wares, too. But then I purchased a small
lot of Morgan silver dollars to resell. I figured, no problem, take my
standard digital picture and sell away. Oops, my mistake. My first pic-
tures of the coins bore only the slightest resemblance to the actual coins.
The digital pictures made my beautiful silver coins look gold! Eeyow!
Then came my next challenge: photographing some silvertone and gold-
tone costume jewelry. My setup — with its perfect positioning, beautiful
lighting, and black velvet jewelry pads — looked stunning. The pictures
should have been perfect. But NO: Silvertone looked gold, and goldtone
looked silver. What’s the deal?
The deal is lighting — specifically, the need for ambient lighting. I thought
back to the days when I worked with catalog photographers who took pic-
tures of jewelry — and I remembered the elaborate setup they used to pro-
duce the sparkling images you see in the ads. And although I can’t re-create
the experts’ silk tents, minimalist lighting, and multiple light flashes per
exposure, I can still set up for some great-looking images that do justice to
my wares. In this technique, I tell you about tools and tricks that can help
you with the task of photographing the tuff stuff. You find out how to use
Cloud Dome, a great light-diffusing tool, and take advantage of the ambient
light you have at home.
Photographing with Ambient Light
Ambient light, light that occurs naturally, is the best light for photograph-
ing many types of items (especially shiny items). Problems start when you
use flash or flood lighting alone (without a Cloud Dome) for pictures of
metallic objects. Common lighting problems that affect the quality of your
photographs include shiny spots from reflections (off walls and ceilings),
washed-out areas (from the glare of the lights) and loss of proper color. 
Enter the Cloud Dome to offer your at-home photos the ability to take
advantage of natural, ambient light. The Cloud Dome looks like a giant

bowl that you place upside-down over the object
you want to photograph. This bowl evenly diffuses
ambient room light over the surface area of the
object. This way, you can produce quality digital
images in average room lighting.
Cloud Dome inventor Cindy Litchfield’s father was a
meteorologist who invented many varied weather-
measuring devices. From her Dad, Cindy was taught
how clouds alter the way colors are viewed. She
learned that clouds would evenly diffuse light — and
that details and a variety of shades could be seen
(oddly enough) even better on a cloudy day.
Cindy was in the jewelry business, and she knew the
pains of shooting quality images of jewels only too
well. To solve the problem, she gathered up her
knowledge and got advice from her mad-scientist
father (and tools from his well-equipped workshop).
After many prototypes, the Cloud Dome was born.
Finally, there was a cost-efficient way to photograph
delicate objects without hot spots, shadows, and
inconsistent lighting.
A fellow eBay University instructor introduced
me to the Cloud Dome, and I’ve found it an
amazing tool. You can purchase the Cloud
Dome and accessories at many professional
camera shops, from the Web site at www.
clouddome.com, or (you guessed it) on eBay.
Shooting with the Cloud Dome
The Cloud Dome looks like a giant Tupperware bowl
with a camera mount attached. Figure 17-1 shows a
Cloud Dome being set up to photograph jewelry.
Follow these steps to take a picture with the dome:
1.
Attach your camera to the Cloud Dome’s mount
with the lens positioned so that it peers into the
hole at the top of the dome.
2.
Place your item on top of a contrasting
background.
See the section “Tips for Taking Cloud Dome
Pictures” later in this technique for ideas on
choosing a background.
3.
Place the dome with camera attached over
your item.
4.
Check the item’s position through your
camera’s viewfinder or LCD screen.
If it’s not in the center, center it. If you feel you
still need added lighting to bring out a highlight,
use an added lamp outside the dome.
5.
Focus your camera and shoot the picture.
• Figure 17-1: Taking a picture with the Cloud Dome.
Many items benefit from being photographed
through a Cloud Dome, especially:

Jewelry: I’ve found that taking pictures with the
Dome keeps the gold color gold and the silver
color silver. Also, using the Cloud Dome helps
your camera pick up details such as engraving
and the metal surrounding cloisonné work. It also
gives pearls their unique luster and soft reflec-
tion, as in Figure 17-2. Much of the detail that the
Cloud Dome helps capture can be washed out
when you apply enough light to take the picture
without it. 

Gems and stones: I’ve seen some beautiful pic-
tures taken of gems and stones with the Cloud
Dome. To achieve a special look, you can use a
Cloud Dome accessory, a reversible gold and sil-
ver reflector, as in Figure 17-3. Especially when
you use the silver side, facets of diamonds glis-
ten as if they were in the pinpoint lights at the

or lamp on the outside of the dome for extra
sparkle.
• Figure 17-2: A pair of pearl earrings.
• Figure 17-3: The facets in the stones of this antique piece
are much clearer with ambient light.

Coins and stamps: The Cloud Dome allows you
to hold the camera steady for extreme close-ups.
It also allows you to photograph coins without
getting any coloration that is not on the coin. For
both coins and stamps, the Cloud Dome helps
you achieve sharp focus and true color.

Holographic or metallic accented items: If
you’ve ever tried to photograph collector cards,
you know that the metal accents glare and holo-
grams are impossible to capture. 
Also, the glossy coatings confuse the camera’s
light sensors, causing over-exposed highlights.

Tips for Taking Cloud
Dome Pictures
Surprisingly, there’s very little learning curve
to using a Cloud Dome. The simple steps in
the preceding section attest to this fact. What
may take you more time is discovering the tips
and tricks that help you achieve professional-
looking results. And reading this section kick-
starts your discovery process.
Here are a few things to keep in mind when taking
photos with the Cloud Dome.

Focus, focus: Due to the focus limitations of
many of today’s digital cameras, I found it best to
use the Cloud Dome with the extension collar
(often sold along with the dome, and shown in
Figure 17-6), which allows you to have your cam-
era 17 inches away from the item you’re photo-
graphing on a flat surface.

Close-ups: When attempting macro (extreme
close-up) photography, the Cloud Dome holds
your camera still while shooting the picture. If
you prefer, after you’ve centered your item,
stand away and take the picture using your cam-
era’s self-timer.
• Figure 17-6: Cloud Dome with an extension collar
attached.

Fine upstanding items: If your item is vertical
and doesn’t lend itself to being photographed
flat, use the angled extension from Cloud Dome,
which allows you to shoot the item from an angle
versus from the top. An angled collar is also sold
separately or in a Cloud Dome package.

Keeping background where it belongs: When
selecting a background for your item, choose a
contrasting background that reflects the light
properly for your item. Make it a solid color;
white is always safe, and black can add dramatic
highlights.

Technique
Touching Up Your
Photos for eBay
Y
ou may hear all kinds of myths — such as “more is better” — 
regarding images for eBay, and personally, I refuse to perpetrate
any more. Because you already know how to take a reasonable pic-
ture of your product (provided, of course, you’ve read the how-to infor-
mation from the preceding techniques in this part), I use this technique
to show you how fast you can get the photos you take — or the scans
you make — spruced up for eBay.
No eBay seller should spend hours playing with and perfecting
images for eBay listings (although some do). One pass through a 
simple image-editing software program gets any reasonable picture
Internet-ready.
The prime concern to have about the pictures you put on eBay is size —
that’s right, in this case, size does matter. You need to limit the picture
file size so you don’t bog down the prospective buyer’s viewing of your
item page (especially if you’re using multiple pictures in the item descrip-
tion). Why? That’s easy — the larger your item’s picture files, the longer
the browser takes to load the item page. And it’s a fact that 4 out of 5
eBay users will click back out of a listing to avoid a long page load. (I’m
guessing that you don’t want your listings to elicit this behavior.)
The maximum size for your individual photos should be no more than
40KB. That’s the maximum; less is better. In this technique, I show you
how to reduce the file size without destroying your picture quality.
Because the size of your picture file is directly related to the picture’s
resolution, this technique also provides what you need to know about
getting the right resolution for an online image.
Viewing Images on a Monitor
To get a better idea of the size for the images you use online, remember
(see Technique 15) that no matter which camera setting you choose, your
image should be designed to be viewed on a monitor. Low resolution is
just fine because the average computer monitor just isn’t an HDTV.

The average monitor resolution settings (in pixels)
are 

640 horizontal x 480 vertical (VGA)

800 x 600 (Super VGA)

1024 x 768 (XVGA) 
These settings determine the number of pixels that
can be viewed on the screen. No matter how large
your monitor is (whether 15, 17, or even 21 inches), it
shows only as many pixels as you determine in its set-
tings. On larger screens, the pixels just get larger —
and make your pictures fuzzy. That’s why most peo-
ple with larger screens set their monitors for a higher
resolution.
Remember that scanned images are measured
in DPI (Dots per Inch). The average monitor dis-
plays scanned images at 72 dpi. Do not confuse
this with pixel size. See more in Technique 15
about scanned images.
Just keep in mind that when you design pictures for
your eBay items, you must design for the lowest
common denominator. There are still many people
using MSNTV (used to be WebTV), and their screen
resolution is fixed at television resolution: 544 x 372.
Also consider that over 60 percent of the United
States Internet population still hooks up with a dial-
up connection; they’re not very likely to be using
high-end monitors with high resolutions.
Since the higher resolutions make the screen
images smaller, many users prefer their screens
at the 800 x 600 size for eye comfort during
the time they spend on the computer. They
don’t want to squint!
The popular viewing resolutions for monitors are:

640 x 480 or 800 x 600 pixels for 15-inch monitors

800 x 600 or 1024 x 768 pixels for 17-inch monitors 

1024 x 768 or 1152 x 864 pixels for 19-inch
monitors
If you use eBay’s Picture Services for all your eBay
items, setting your image size is not a big issue. eBay
Picture Services apply a compression algorithm that
will force your pictures into eBay’s pre-prescribed
size — and, odds are, they’ll look fuzzy as they are
forced into high compression (squeezing the pixels
to the prescribed size).
Using eBay’s Picture Services (for the free image) is
a good idea. It’s the only way to get a picture of your
item at the top of the listing near the title. 
The more compression put into computer
images, the less sharp they appear. So why not
set your images to a monitor-friendly size in a
software program before uploading them?
Choosing an Image-Editing Tool
There are plenty of image-editing programs available
these days — everything from simple shareware pro-
grams like IrfanView to high-dollar programs like
Adobe Photoshop.
Well, okay, I certainly don’t expect you to invest hun-
dreds of dollars (and possibly hundreds of hours)
in learning the program. But I do suspect you’ll
spend a few bucks for a program that can give you
professional-looking results.
If you’re in business, you need to select soft-
ware that works well, without too many bells
and confusing whistles. Since your images are
a lifeline to your sales, I suggest that you plan
on paying for a solid program.
I really like the program Paint Shop Pro from JASC.
It’s so straightforward and easy to use that it may
even fully convert me over from PhotoShop, which I
learned to use in my graphic-design days. It’s reason-
ably priced and easy to learn. Understandably, JASC
Software has become part of the eBay Community —
they sell their software on the site and have an eBay
Store.

Brightness and Contrast. These two functions
usually work together in most photo programs.
By giving your picture more brightness, it (duh)
makes the picture look brighter. Raising contrast
brings out the detail and lowering it dulls the dif-
ference between light and dark.

Sharpen. If your camera was not perfectly in
focus when you took the picture, applying a
photo editing programs sharpen feature can help.
Be careful not to sharpen too much, or it can
destroy the smoothness of the image.
If your images need any more help than the above
three alterations, it’s probably easier (and faster)
just to retake the picture.

Other popular image-editing programs
There’s a wide array of image-editing software used by
eBay sellers. As a matter of fact, some listing software has
built-in mini-editing capabilities (see Part X for more on
third-party software for eBay).
Choosing software for your images is like picking your office
chair. What’s right for some people is dreadful for others.
You might want to ask some of your friends what they use —

Suppose you just took a bunch of pictures for your
new eBay items, using camera settings between
640 x 480 and 1024 x 768. (Those are common low-
resolution digital camera settings.) Now you need to
get these pictures snazzed up to give your items the
best possible image (and get you the best possible
price).
The process for fixing your pictures is twofold: (1)
knowing which common edits improve your pic-
tures’ appearance on eBay and then (2) doing them.

Surprise. Pictures don’t always come out of the cam-
era in perfect form. There are a very few tweaks you
can make to bring them into perfection range.

Cropping. Sometimes there’s a little too much
background and not enough product. Don’t
waste precious bandwidth on extraneous pixels.
To crop your image means to cut away the part
of the picture that is unnecessary.

Browse to find an image to open on your stor-
age medium.
This can be a floppy disk (such as images from
the Sony Mavica FD series), memory stick, com-
pact flash card, or an area on your hard drive
where you stored your images.
3.
Click to put a check mark in the box that says
Show preview.
Before you can select the correct image to edit,
you have to get a look at it, right?
4.
Click the selected image filename so it appears
in the File Name box (as in Figure 18-2), and
then click Open.
• Figure 18-2: Selecting the image to open.
Your picture opens into the program. Note the
Overview palette on the page, the tiny preview of
your picture, and the Info Tab.
5.
Click the Info Tab to see the specifications of
your picture (as in Figure 18-3).
6.
If your image is sideways (as they often are),
click Image, select the way you want the image
rotated, and then click Rotate.
Figure 18-4 shows the list of rotation options you
can use to put your picture in the proper per-
spective. It’s so annoying to have sideways pic-
tures on an item page — and so many do! (Hey,
call it an instant advantage when you can reduce
annoyance.)
• Figure 18-3: Checking the Image size via the Info Tab.
• Figure 18-4: Selecting the rotation parameters.
7.
Check your picture for trim size.
When your picture is properly placed, take a
good look at it. Does it show any extraneous
padding around the subject? There usually is at
least some.

Point your cursor to the toolbar on the left side
of your screen and click the Crop tool, as shown
in Figure 18-5.

you are, click OK.
You can view what your image will look like before
you go with your choices (see Figure 18-8).

• Figure 18-5: Setting the cropping border.
9.
Put your cursor on the approximate place
you’d like the new corner of your picture to be,
hold your mouse button down as you drag the
mouse to the far corner of your selected area. 
As you do so, the Crop tool draws a rectangle over
the area. Stop when you’ve reached your desired
image size and let go of your mouse button.
10.
If you want to adjust your cropping area, click
and drag an edge or corner handle to adjust
the rectangle’s size.
11.
When you’re satisfied with the terms of your
crop, double-click the image.
Poof! It crops itself and appears at your new size,
as in Figure 18-6.
12.
If you feel that the color of your image isn’t
vibrant enough, or too dark, click Adjust (at the
top of the screen) and go to Brightness and
Contrast (as in Figure 18-7).
A window opens with a section of your image
repeated twice. There will be Brightness and
Contrast boxes in the Window below your image.
13.
Click the Brightness arrows that point up (to
brighten the picture) or down (to darken the
picture). Do the same with the Contrast arrows

In the Pixel Dimensions area, change the drop-
down menu from Percent to Pixels, and then
type in a pixel size that suits your auctions.
Keep your largest number no higher than
approximately 400 pixels. In Figure 18-10, I’ve
selected 350 pixels for my image height.

At this point, it might be nice (though it’s not
absolutely necessary) to check how your image will
look in a Web browser. This isn’t necessary with
every picture, but I’ll show you how you can do it:
1.
Click View➪Preview in Web Browser, as 
pictured in Figure 18-11.
The Preview in Web Browser box asks you to
select whether you want to see a GIF or JPG
image. 
2.
Select JPG➪Preview.
The JPEG Optimizer appears.

• Figure 18-13: Paint Shop Pro previews your image in a
Web browser.
Now that I’ve done this twice, I can do my eBay pic-
tures in this program in about a minute each!
• Figure 18-11: Selecting Web Browser view.
If you don’t want to preview your picture in
the Web browser, you can also optimize your
JPEG when you save the image.
The program shows you both compressed and
uncompressed versions of the image file size. You
can click a tab to see download times and esti-
mate how long it would take to download at dif-
ferent Internet-connection speeds. In Figure 18-12,
it’s clear that my image’s file size is way to big
(and will take too long to load) for use on eBay.
3.
Click the Quality tab, to set the Compression
Value higher.
A higher number will compress the image file
size. You can see how your image is affected by
the compression by looking at it in the right view
window. Your original image will be on the left for
comparison
4.
When you’re happy that you’ve compressed the
picture all you can without doing too much
damage to it, click OK.
You’ll see the image in your Web browser with
statistics underneath it on loading times as in
Figure 18-13.
5.
If you’re happy with all that you’ve done,
choose File➪Save As, select the location that
you want to save your picture, give it a name,
and click Save.

Uploading Your
Pictures to a Server
E
veryone eventually seems to figure out how to upload a picture on
eBay’s Picture Services (but why should you waste time figuring it
out when I explain it here?). Still, to most users, uploading their pic-
tures to their own Web space seems to remain a major mystery. Many
users are still convinced that they have to pay for an image-hosting 
service — but that’s rarely the case these days.
Higher bids and closed sales go hand in hand with quality images at
eBay. The better the quality of your pictures, the more comfortable a
prospective buyer feels when perusing your items. At least they know
you actually have the item for sale, and they can get a good look at it.
Making sales by effectively using images is what this part of the book is
all about.
In this technique, I show you some easy ways to upload your pictures
to your Web site or to your ISP’s Web space. Doing so means you don’t
incur extra fees from eBay for including multiple pictures in your listings.
I highly recommend that your first move be to take advantage of the one
free picture from eBay’s Picture Services. First, it’s available at no charge,
and second, Picture Services offers many other benefits. Read on and I’ll
show you just a few.
Using eBay’s Picture Services
At this point, I’ll go back to my basic assumptions about you. I assume
you know how to list an item on eBay — or at the very least, you can
make your way through the Sell Your Item form and get to the Add
Pictures step.
When you arrive there, you need to upload a picture to eBay, whether or
not you’ve got pictures in your description. Why? Because the first picture
is free — why turn down anything free? — and because your uploaded pic-
ture becomes part of the ultraimportant top area of the item page, as
shown in Figure 19-1.

Technique 19: Uploading Your Pictures to a Server
126
• Figure 19-1: The item image is often where the
prospective buyer looks first.
Have you ever noticed that some items that you
browse on eBay do not have this crucial picture at
the top? That’s a shame, because these sellers are
not availing themselves of eBay’s Picture Services
and they’re losing sales as a result. Having that pic-
ture at the top of the page is a first-rate way (and did
I mention free? ) to pull a buyer into your listing.
Uploading your picture
I’m making another assumption here: You’ve already
taken a picture, uploaded or scanned it, and saved it
somewhere on your computer’s hard drive.
For organization’s sake, you might consider
making a subfolder in your My Pictures direc-
tory called eBay Photos. That way you can
always find your eBay pictures quickly, without
searching through photos of your family
reunion to find the picture of the computer or
vase you want to sell on eBay.
When you reach the part of eBay Picture Services
that allows you to add pictures, look for the Add
Picture button in the First Picture — Free area, as
shown in Figure 19-2.
When you reach the part that allows you to add 
pictures, be sure the area is entitled eBay Picture
Services. If, for some reason, your Add Pictures area
shows a tab that says Basic eBay Picture, scroll
down and look for the Upgrade to our free full-
featured version link. This will send you to eBay’s
Picture Services as shown in Figure 19-2.
By uploading your picture with eBay Picture Services,
you can adjust your pictures by cropping or rotating
(in case you shot the picture sideways) online.
• Figure 19-2: eBay’s full-featured Picture Services.
If you have never used eBay’s Advanced Picture
Services before, a Windows Security Warning pops
up, asking your permission to install a small pro-
gram on your computer, as shown in Figure 19-3.
This is safe (and the only way you can use eBay
Picture Service features), so click Yes. Your screen
will change to the Advanced Picture Services view.
Then, to upload your picture, follow these steps:
1.
Click the Add Picture button.
A window pops up, prompting you to open an
image file on your computer.
2.
Navigate to the directory that holds your eBay
images.

Using Your Free ISP Space
127
If you choose to upload other images, there
will be a 15-cent charge per picture. Why not
just read on and learn how to use more pic-
tures without paying a fee in the section titled
“Using Your Free ISP Space.”
On the bottom of the eBay Picture Services page,
there is a Gallery option, under the Increase your
item’s visibility headline. (For more on eBay’s options
check out Technique 8.) If you select the Gallery
option, the picture you just uploaded to eBay will
become your Gallery picture. I highly recommend
the Gallery — for 25 cents. You can’t get a better
bang for your quarter of a buck.
When you’ve finished with this page, click Continue.
A pop-up window notifies you that your picture is
being uploaded to eBay’s picture server.
Using Your Free ISP Space
Everyone who connects to the Internet from his or
her own computer has an Internet Service Provider
or ISP. This is the company that you pay a monthly
fee to for the privilege of hooking up to the Internet
using their servers. AT&T Worldnet, Earthlink, Road
Runner, AOL, or a local provider in your area are
examples of ISPs.
Many of these ISPs give you a minimum of 5 MB
(that’s megabytes) of space to put a personal home
page up on the Internet. You can usually store your
images for your eBay sales there — unless your
provider has some strict rules about not doing that
(it’s a good idea to check first).
Obtaining an FTP program
Internet providers may supply you with an image
upload area, but they may require you to use File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) to upload your images. If so,
you may want to locate an FTP program to help you
manage this process.
You may be able to find a free or shareware (requir-
ing a small fee) FTP program on sites such as
3.
Select the image you want to upload and click
Open.
Your selected picture appears on the eBay
Picture Services screen.
• Figure 19-3: Windows Security Warning — it’s okay.
If you’ve accidentally selected the wrong picture,
click the X in the lower-left corner to make the
picture disappear so you can select a different
one.
Editing a picture on the eBay server
Once your picture appears on the eBay Picture
Services page, you can alter its appearance in two
ways:

You now may rotate the picture 90 degrees at a
time, by clicking the small circle with the arrow
in the upper-right corner of the picture.

To crop the picture, place your mouse at the cor-
ner or sides of the picture and drag inward. This
will produce a small marquee. You can now drag
the proportional marquee by placing your mouse
in the center and clicking and dragging the
square around the picture to select the area you
want to use in your listing. Once the picture is
uploaded to eBay’s server, the picture will be
cropped as you indicated.

I use a program called CuteFTP. (That name might
sound familiar, because I also mention an HTML
design program called CuteHTML in Technique 21.)
You can purchase CuteFTP in a software bundle with
CuteHTML.
CuteFTP is also available for the Mac.
I’ve been using both of these products for years
because they’re easy to use and reliable. They’ve
never given me a whit of a problem, so I highly rec-
ommend them. You can find both products at the
GlobalScape site at www.globalscape.com/o/912.
Before you upload a picture, your image
must be ready to go and Internet ready. See
Technique 18 for details.
Uploading your picture to an ISP server
Now I show you how to upload pictures using
CuteFTP. Most FTP software programs work in a 
similar fashion, but CuteFTP really automates the
entire process.
You can download a trial version and install it
on your computer to try out for a limited time. After
you have installed the program, open it and follow
these steps to upload a file to an ISP server:
1.
Select File➪Connection Wizard.
The CuteFTP Connection Wizard shown in Figure
19-4 appears.
2.
Click the arrow on the Choose Your ISP drop-
down list to display it, and locate your Internet
service provider. Once you’ve found your ISP,
click Next.
• Figure 19-4: The CuteFTP Connection Wizard.

On the next screen (shown in Figure 19-5), type
in the user name and password that you use to
log in to your Internet account.
4.
Click Next.

5.
Click the Browse button (shown in Figure 19-6)
to locate the directory on your computer where
you store your eBay images.

Click Finish.
• Figure 19-7: The last step in the Wizard.
From this point on, every time you open the pro-
gram (if you’ve selected automatic connection in
Step 5), CuteFTP logs in to your Web space and dis-
plays the screen shown in Figure 19-8. Note that the
left side of the program is open to the directory you
selected as the default for your eBay images. The
box on the right shows what is currently on your
ISP-provided home page.
To upload an image, double-click it. Faster than I
could take a screen shot (okay, I took it anyway and
it’s Figure 19-9), it’s automatically uploaded to my
Web space!
• Figure 19-8: Signing on to your FTP space.
Uploading images to AOL
AOL handles image uploads a bit differently from
other ISPs. (But those of you on AOL knew that
already). Many people love AOL because it provides
an easy, step-by-step interface. As you probably
imagine, uploading pictures is handled in that same
AOL style.

Technique
Listing Touchups
and HTML without
the Headaches
I
must admit, the very thought of using HTML in my auctions used to
terrify me (pinky swear you won’t tell the people at eBay). HTML.
Doesn’t it sound so very high-tech and geeklike? But HTML isn’t all
that scary once you realize that it’s just a fancy name for Hypertext
Markup Language, a pretty easy to use language for creating online con-
tent. All you need to know is the markup part. HTML uses tags to mark
up pages to include elements such as text and graphics in a way that Web
browsers understand. A Web browser sees the tags and knows how to
display the document (that is, the Web page). HTML also makes possible
the whole work of links. When you click a link, you jump to another
place: another Web page, document, or file, for example.
Many eBay sellers somehow think that putting dancing bears, flaming
graphics, and background music in their auctions will bring in more bids.
Unfortunately, that’s pretty far from the truth. People go to your auctions
to find information and get a great deal on something they want, not to
be entertained. They need to see the facts, placed cleanly and neatly on
the page.
The addition of music to your auction may cause another problem:
an extremely s-l-o-o-o-o-w page load for those on dialup connections.
If loading your page takes too long, believe me, most people will click
back and go to another listing.
So what should you do to attract buyers? I spent most of my career in the
advertising business, and the byword of good advertising is, “Keep it sim-
ple!” An organized and well-written selling description will outsell danc-
ing bears and pictures of your children every time.
That’s why HTML is now my friend — you can create a professional look
for your sales through the use of varied typefaces, type sizes, and colors.
In Technique 21, I show you how to create templates using an HTML gen-
erator. But using the generator without understanding the commands
is akin to using a language translator without speaking a word of the 
language — you’re never really sure if what’s coming out is correct or how

to make minor tweaks yourself. In this technique, I
want you to understand what HTML commands are
all about.
Writing Your Title and
Description
I’m sure most of you are already selling on eBay, so
I’m not going to bore you with a beginner’s tutorial
on writing auction descriptions.
What I’d like to do is to go over some of the glaring
mistakes that constantly appear in eBay listings so
you can avoid them. Often sales are lost because of
obscure titles and overcomplicated selling policies.
All CAPITAL titles
The reason scribes of long ago invented upper- and
lowercase letters was that they made phrases and
sentences easier to read. When titles appear in all
capitals, they are not interpreted as quickly by
prospective buyers when their eyes dance over a
search result or page.
Often, when somebody uses all uppercase in
auction titles, it looks like a crazed salesman is
screaming at the reader. Use upper- and lower-
case in bold face type within your descriptions
instead by using HTML. Read on to learn how.
It is okay to use uppercase letters for a few, select
words in your title. Take a look at the titles listed
here; decide for yourself which ones make effective
use of capital letters:

BEAUTIFUL VINTAGE 23” ARMAND MARSEILLE
DOLL
It’s easy to see that in a page loaded with hundreds
of listings, those in upper- and lowercase combined
are easier to read.
Wasted titles
In my research (see Part II), I found that over 65 per-
cent of people searching eBay are searching titles only.
To my mind, that makes the 55 characters allowed in
an eBay title the most valuable real estate on the site.
Treat your titles with respect. Titles are not advertis-
ing, they are tools for the eBay search engine. If your
title reflects what prospective buyers want, they’ll
click your listing to find out more.
Many eBay sellers use comments in their titles.
While teaching classes at eBay University, I’ve
polled the students and have still to find any-
one who searches for these words: Nice,
LQQK, Must See, Great, WOW, or Cool.
Take a look at some actual item titles and think
about how you could improve them:

MS65 PCI FULL STRUCK 1921 MORGAN DOLLAR
NICE!

GARLIQUE, All Natural, 60 Tablets, WOW!!

VINTAGE SET PORCELIAN ROSES**LQQK**NR**

GREAT Fendi purse Must see!!!!

COOL! *BLACK ONYX* silver pendant
There is plenty of room in these titles to list colors,
types, sizes, and more descriptive nouns that would
make better use of the space. Bottom line: Use as
many keywords as the title will allow.

Technique 20: Listing Touchups and HTML without the Headaches
134
But even if you use one of eBay’s lovely graphic
designs, you would still need to format your text.
That’s where your HTML coding comes in.
You can also use HTML to insert multiple pic-
tures in your descriptions to better promote
your item. This won’t cost you a penny extra,
and you can still use eBay’s Pictures Services’
one free photo for your top-of-listing picture.
For information on how to upload your images
to a server, see Technique 19.
What HTML can do
Take a look at Figure 20-1; it contains an auction
description typed in the Notepad program that you’ll
find in Windows Accessories.
• Figure 20-1: Raw auction text in Notepad.
If I add some appropriate HTML coding from Table
20-1 (at the end of this technique) to the file, the 
auction page will look a whole lot different, as shown
in Figure 20-2.
Negative comments
I’m sure many of us have run across listings that are
overrun with negativity. What sells your item (aside
from clear and complete information) is a positive tone
throughout your description. Here are some examples:

DO NOT BID ON MY ITEM UNLESS YOU UNDER-
STAND AND FOLLOW MY STRICT POLICIES!

If you have a less-than-10 feedback rating, do not
bid — it will be cancelled.

I will only send one e-mail requesting your infor-
mation. If you don’t respond, the item will be
relisted and I will leave negative feedback!

If the bidder does not contact me within three
days of winning the auction, the item will be
relisted and negative feedback will be given.

WE WILL FILE NON-PAYING BIDDING ALERTS ON
ALL DEADBEAT CUSTOMERS.
I’m sure when you read those comments, you felt a
bit queasy. Although there may be a reason for the
seller to make those remarks, the way they are
phrased makes the reader uncomfortable.
Try to use a nice tone when listing your sales
requirements. That way, your verbiage won’t set up
what could (otherwise) be a positive transaction as
an adversarial deal!
Make your policies in smaller letters — I don’t
mean teeny-tiny, but smaller. This will get the
message across without becoming overbearing.
Getting Friendly with HTML
When you want to dress up your auctions, you could
use one of eBay’s graphic themes. (Remember that
will add an additional 10 cents to your listing fee.)
You could insert your own graphics into your listing,
and it wouldn’t cost you a penny more.

Getting Friendly with HTML
135
• Figure 20-2: Auction description dolled up with HTML.
Pretty cool, huh?
How HTML works
HTML uses a series of codes to indicate display
specifics to a browser, such as when text should be
bold or italic, or when text is actually a link. Brackets
are used to indicate commands: What’s within them
is an instruction rather than actual text that should
appear on your page.
In the example that follows, the b and I in brackets
indicate that text between them should be formatted
bold and italic. Notice that there is both a start for-
matting and end formatting indication (<b> starts bold
formatting and </b> ends it). Here’s one example:

HTML start and end tags:
<b><I></I></b>

The same tags with text between them:
<b><I>eBay tools</I></b>

The resulting text on your page:
eBay tools
See? Using such commands you can set up text on a
page to be formatted in bold, begin a new paragraph,
fall into a list format, and so on.
Table 20-1 lists many of the common HTML
tags to get you started.
A few things to keep in mind about HTML:

Don’t worry about placing a return at the end of
a line. You must use a command to go to the next
line so pressing Enter on your keyboard has no
effect on what the page looks like.

It’s not necessary to put the paragraph command
at the beginning and at the end of the paragraph.
This is one command that doesn’t need a close.
Just put the command, <p>, where you want the
breaking space.

The same principle applies for a horizontal rule,
<hr>. Just place the command where you want
the line and it will appear.

Most HTML coding commands have a beginning
and an end. The beginning code is in < > and to
end the formatting, you must repeat the code —
only this time with a slash </ >. 

Because people have different fonts set up on
their computers, they may not have the funky
font you want to display. Be sure to list (as in the
code shown here) alternate fonts for your text. If
you don’t, different browsers may substitute
other fonts that might look really funky on some
readers’ pages!

to bold HTML code when you use it.
Using Tables
Have you ever noticed how some people manage to
have a photo on the right or left side of their
descriptions? It’s really not that difficult to do. It
just involves a little HTML code added to the listing
using something called tables, which are thoroughly
discussed in Technique 21.
In this example, there is a picture contained in a
table on the left side of the description, as shown in
Figure 20-3. (By the way, when the full version of this
auction ran on eBay, with the kind cooperation of
the people on The View, we raised over $1,000 for
UNICEF!)
If you’d like to see how HTML looks, I’ve placed an
auction description here and put the HTML code in
bold so it’s easier to spot:
<center><font
face=’VERDANA,HELVETICA,ARIAL’
color=’crimson’ size=5>

Ebay Sellers! This is for you! Are you
tired of trying to find a nice clear
spot to take your pictures for eBay
sales? Sure you could spend a fortune on
backdrops and muslin, but this handy,
portable stage works (without glare)
flawlessly every time. This is the most
versatile product that I’ve found for
tabletop photography. </font>

The Infiniti Board is white textured,
washable and scratch proof. It can be
used flat or curved; the height and
curve are adjustable with the attached
locking cords. The total size is 19
inches wide by 28 inches long. <P>

Creating Your Own
HTML Templates
W
hen you’re ready to take on eBay in earnest, it really helps to
have a few auction description templates all set up and ready
to go. This is what the big guys, those top sellers on eBay, do
(granted, some do a better job than others). Although it’s fun to play
around with using different graphics as you sell on eBay — and I must
admit, I’ve seem some cute ones — having a standard look to your ads
establishes you as a serious, professional seller. After all, how often does
eBay change its look? (Okay, maybe that’s a bad example.) The answer is
not too often. The colors and the basic look remain the same because this
is eBay’s very valuable brand.
What might go into a template? Well, you can insert your logo within your
description, or add links to your Me page or your store, for example. Look
at it this way: Your template can become your “brand.”
Many auction-management services offer predesigned templates for
your descriptions, but they often charge a lot of money for their ser-
vices. Alternatively, you can put together your own template and update
it occasionally.
Keeping your look simple and showing off your product will bring in
high bids. Getting carried away with graphics that have nothing to do
with your item is distracting (unless you have a cute picture of your
dog or cat — doesn’t everyone like a fluffy mascot?).
Most HTML generators are often overwhelming and hard to learn. What
to do? Here’s my secret to good-looking templates: I have been working
with easy-to-use software for a long time. In this technique, I show you
how to design simple templates in GlobalSCAPE’s CuteHTML. I think it’s a
great tool that grows with you. The more HTML you understand, the
more you can do with it.
Also, on my Web site, I offer a quick HTML generator that you can down-
load and use. It will give you an easy template that you can customize
with only a little extra HTML knowledge.

Technique 21: Creating Your Own HTML Templates
140
Setting Up Your Templates
Few things in this life are absolute necessities, but
photos in your eBay listings definitely are! It’s a good
idea to begin by building a template that includes a
space for a photo. You can use a program called
CuteHTML to do just that.
Check out Technique 20 for a sample of a
basic layout written in HTML.
Getting CuteHTML
CuteHTML is a wonderful HTML generator from
GlobalSCAPE. The software (like me) has been
around for many years and over time has added
many useful features, though not so many that the
program is difficult to use.
You can download a free trial version at
www.globalscape.com/o/914
After your free trial is over, you can opt to purchase
the software for $19.99. It’s worth it: The software
will be a workhorse for you, as it has been for me,
through thousands of auctions.
CuteHTML is also bundled with another prod-
uct, CuteFTP. CuteFTP is an extremely easy-to-
use program for uploading your eBay pictures
to your Web space. Read more about CuteFTP
in Technique 19.
Adding text and graphics with CuteHTML
After you’ve downloaded and installed it, open
CuteHTML and you’ll see a page with some code on
it. Just drag your mouse over this text and delete it.
The first time you use CuteHTML, choose
Tools, then Settings. In the Settings dialog box,
select the Word Wrap check box. With Word
Wrap activated, the text you enter will wrap to
the next line so you can see all the text on the
screen. If Word Wrap is not activated, your
text will go off the edge of the screen as you
type, wasting valuable time scrolling back and
forth to read it.
The first thing to do is to create a table that contains
a photo on the right and text on the left.
1.
Click the Table button on the toolbar.
A Table palette appears.
2.
Click the top-left corner and drag to the right
until the label at the bottom reads 2 by 1 table,
as shown in Figure 21-1.
This creates a table with two cells side-by-side.
When you release your mouse, the table palette
disappears, and the HTML coding for 2 cells will
appear on-screen, as shown in Figure 21-2.
• Figure 21-1: Creating a table with two cells.

Setting Up Your Templates
141
6.
Highlight the Row 1 Cell 2 text on your
screen, and enter the description text you want
to appear next to the picture.
For convenience, you can also open an auction
description you’ve already written in the
Windows Notepad, and copy and paste it into the
cell space.
• Figure 21-3: Inserting a picture URL.
If you want to visually check your progress as
you go, click the View In Browser button (the
teeny magnifying glass over a world globe) on
the toolbar. This opens up your work in a
browser window, looking as it would appear
when viewed on the Internet.
Adding HTML formatting
If you preview your text in an Internet browser at this
point, as in Figure 21-4, you notice that all the sen-
tences run together in one mammoth paragraph.
Adding HTML text attributes fixes this. You can use
buttons on the toolbar to add text attributes or links.
To set text attributes, follow these steps:
1.
Highlight the text you want to change.
• Figure 21-2: Coding for a 2 x 1 table in the CuteHTML
screen.
In CuteHTML, all HTML coding is in blue by
default. Words you input into the program are
in black. Anchors (which are places you indi-
cated to open another Internet page upon a
click by the viewer) appear in green; links to
Web pages or images appear in red.
As an alternative to using the graphic toolbar,
you can also click Tools and select most of the
tags from Insert Tag that you want to insert.
3.
Highlight the text Row 1 Cell 1 space between
the HTML opening and closing code, and click
the Image button in the toolbar. (It looks like a
little picture.)
The Image Tag dialog box opens.
4.
Type the Internet address (URL) where your
image is stored in the Source text box, as
shown in Figure 21-3.
If you want to alter the size of your image, you
can also type in a numeric pixel width or height
(or both) in the appropriate boxes.
5.
Click OK, and the HTML code for the image will
appear.

Technique 21: Creating Your Own HTML Templates
142
• Figure 21-4: A screen filled in with the image URL and
straight text.
2.
Click the formatting button on the toolbar for
the text formatting styles you want to apply.
3.
Make your selection, and the attribute coding is
automatically inserted.
If there are additional commands that you’d
like to insert (such as line break, paragraph,
list, and so on) and you do not see the corre-
sponding button on the toolbar, type an open
HTML command bracket < and the first letter
of the command. A list of suggested com-
mands drops down in the next text space; this
is the program’s “Tag Tips.” Click the one you
need, and the HTML command is inserted.
Then type the closing bracket >. Use the table
of HTML tags in Technique 20 for suggestions.
Once you’ve gone through these steps, the CuteHTML
screen will look like the one in Figure 21-5.
Now you can see your final auction description,
which will look like Figure 21-6, by clicking the View
In Browser button on the toolbar.
Save your HTML when you’re happy with the results.
When you’re ready to use that auction description,
just open the file, copy the code, and paste it into
the eBay auction description area for the appropri-
ate item.
• Figure 21-5: Inserting the final paragraph break using
CuteHTML’s Tag Tips.
• Figure 21-6: A beautiful, quickly created template!
CuteHTML has many other features, including cus-
tom colors, anchors, and spell check. Once you’ve
learned the basics and can create your own tem-
plates, poke around and see how fancy you can get
with this small (but powerful) program.

Part IV
Finishing Off Your
Auctions


22
Notifying Winners
and Sending
Invoices
T
hank goodness, somebody submitted a winning bid on one of your
items in an auction. It’s a good feeling. When I get those end-of-
transaction e-mails from eBay, I whisper a silent YEAH! Then I hold
my breath to see if the buyer will go directly to PayPal and make the pay-
ment. Usually, that’s what happens. More and more buyers are getting
savvy and understand about paying immediately after winning an item.
New buyers, and those who buy or win multiple items from you (my
favorite kind of buyer!) usually wait to hear from you regarding payment
and shipping. Many newbies feel more comfortable hearing from you and
knowing who they are doing business with. Also, in the case of multiple
purchases, you have to recalculate the postage. The sooner you contact
the buyer, the sooner you’ll get your payment.
Notifying Winners
eBay sends out an end-of-transaction e-mail to both the buyer and the
seller. The e-mail is informative to the seller and, hopefully, a welcome
e-mail for the buyer.
Figure 22-1 shows you a typical, “yippee, you won” e-mail. It is brightly
colored and joyful, probably designed to evoke some strong level of
excitement in the buyer. Note that in the winner’s e-mail, there is a link
for the buyer to pay via PayPal.
Both e-mails have similar information; the one to the buyer will have the
link to pay now. The seller’s e-mail will have a link to create an invoice.
Either of these linked forms include:

and all purchased items to an eBay Buy folder —
delete the e-mails when the transaction is finished
and the feedback is left.)
If you think eBay’s notification is good enough, it’s
time to rethink your customer service policy. An
e-mail to the buyer at this point is important.
Customer contact is key to a good transaction.
If the buyer sprints directly to PayPal and sends
you some money to pay for a purchase — a
different e-mail is required. Thank them for
their payment and let them know when the
item will ship (see the next section, “Thanking
them kindly”).
Thanking them kindly
I know you’re happy that the customer bought your
item, and you know you’re happy. Now’s the time
to let the customer know just how darned tickled
you are that this person spent hard-earned money
with you.
Time to send out a thank-you e-mail. This is a quasi-
invoice and informational note. What should go in it?
Well, try to keep in mind what your mother said —
always say please and thank you. After thanking the
buyer for purchasing your goods, be sure to cover
the following points (this is where the please part
comes in):

Item name. Lest they forget what they purchased
from you.

Payment terms. Let the buyer know what forms
of payment you will accept and how long you
intend to wait for your money.

Payment Address. Be sure to tell them where
you want the money sent.

PayPal link. Inserting a PayPal link in your e-mail
is a snap and may pay off in some rapid pay-
ments; see Technique 33 for instructions.

Return Policy. Will you accept returns? Under
what circumstances? It’s OK if you won’t accept

Seller’s/Buyer’s User ID

Seller’s/Buyer’s Details (first initial, last name,
city, and state)

Seller/Buyer’s e-mail addresses

Ship-to ZIP code

A bunch of links:
 For the buyer to confirm his or her ZIP code
 To view the item; this link is good for up to 90
days. (Note that this is the only place you get
this link, and unless you subscribe to eBay’s
Selling Manager, you’d better keep hold of it.)
Sold items remain on your My eBay page for
30 days, but the items disappear from the
eBay search engine within 2 weeks.
 A buyer’s link to complete checkout to let the
seller know the intended payment method
 eBay Help
 A feedback link
• Figure 22-1: Lucky you! You’re a winner!
That’s a lot of information, and I’ll bet the average
user just glances over it and either deletes it (bad
idea) or files it in a special folder in his or her e-mail
program. (Create extra folders in your e-mail pro-
gram and drag all sold items to an eBay Sales folder,

Notifying Winners
149
returns, but be sure that you had that informa-
tion in your item description before the purchase
was made.

Reminder to print the e-mail and enclose it
with payment. Veteran eBay sellers can all tell
you stories about the money order that arrived
with no item number, no return address, no
e-mail address — basically no clue as to what the
payment was for.

Store pitch. If you have an eBay Store, mention it
here. If not, just be sure to tell the buyer you are
happy to have them as a customer and you look
forward to serving them again.

Feedback pitch. Most PowerSellers that I know
include a small pitch at the closing of the e-mail
that asks buyers to leave feedback on eBay, which
will encourage future sales. Remind the customers
to e-mail you immediately if there is a problem
when the order arrives. Stress how you want them
to be happy with their purchases. That may stave
off some of the knee-jerk negatives that beginners
tend to leave when an item arrives cracked. (They
shoulda bought insurance — and it helps to
require insurance on very fragile items.)
That ought to do it. Including this information will
make your newbie buyer or old-time veteran feel at
home doing business with you.
Thanks for the money!
Sometimes you have to beg for payment. On the
other hand, when some blessed buyer pays immedi-
ately through PayPal, it’s time to show your gratitude.
Now’s the time to send the old thanks-for-the-money
e-mail. This doesn’t have to be very long. Make it
short and sweet and to the point. Be sure to

Thank the customer for the purchase and swift
payment.

Let her know when the item will ship.

Let the person know that the business is 
appreciated.

Let the customer know when feedback will be
left. (I leave feedback only when the transaction
is complete — when the buyer has received the
item and is happy with the transaction. You find
more about the gentle art of feedback in
Technique 25, later in this part.)
Auto-sending invoices from Selling Manager
One of my favorite features of eBay’s pay-by-the-
month program, Selling Manager, is that I can follow
the progress of my sales from the Selling Manager
Summary page.
When an item has been won or paid for via PayPal,
you can click the appropriate link to see it in the list.
Figure 22-2 shows my Sold Listings: Paid & Waiting
To Ship area in Selling Manager.
• Figure 22-2: Sold! And ready to ship.
Notice that there is a record number next to the win-
ner’s e-mail address. To send an e-mail
1.
Click the record number, and you’re sent to the
Sales Record for that transaction.
When you get there, you see the items sold to
that buyer. (If there have been more than one
purchase from the same buyer, you see this nota-
tion and can click to combine the purchases in
the Sales Record; see Figure 22-3.)
2.
Click the button that says E-Mail Buyer.
3.
Select the appropriate e-mail to send.
You can personalize the e-mail further by altering
the Selling Manager supplied templates (if you
choose) before you send it.

Sending Out Invoices
Invoices look very professional. On the other hand,
they can be kind of cold and impersonal. PayPal or
eBay will send out invoices automatically for you,
but thankfully, you can customize them.
PayPal invoicing
To set up your PayPal account to send out invoices
automatically when an item is purchased, follow
these steps:
1.
Go to www.PayPal.com and log on to your
account.
2.
Click the Auction Tools tab.
3.
Scroll down to the heading Invoicing Your
Buyer and click the link Winning Buyer
Notification.
The PayPal Winning Buyer Notification
Registration page, as pictured in Figure 22-4, is
displayed.
• Figure 22-4: PayPal’s invoicing central command.

When you’re ready for the e-mail to go, click
Send.
• Figure 22-3: Item summary and the E-Mail Buyer link.
Selling Manager’s Customizable
Templates
Selling Manager has seven e-mail templates that you can
quickly and easily customize. As shown in the figure below,
these templates allow you to add Auto Text features;
eBay’s server fills in the proper information for that particu-
lar transaction.
Notice the drop-down menu that provides tools to edit any
of the eBay-supplied templates.
When a winner buys an item, I have a preformatted Winning
Buyer Notification letter I created from a template; if they pay
immediately via PayPal, I also have a payment-received
e-mail.

Sending Out Invoices
151
4.
Select the eBay User ID you have registered
with PayPal from the field labeled Registered
User ID.
If you have more than one eBay User ID regis-
tered with PayPal, they will all be listed in a drop-
down box in this field.
5.
Customize your message.
The blank text box allows you to enter up to
2,000 characters of a personal message. There’s
plenty of room to fill in all the niceties, so lather
it on. Remember, this is a cold invoice when it
comes to the buyer. It’s up to you to make it nice!
6.
If you have a logo you use on your Web site or
eBay Store, enter the URL that will display it, so
it appears at the top of your invoice.
You can also select any image that you’d like to
appear on your invoice using this method. The
image must be 150 x 100 pixels in size, 10 KB or
smaller, and in a GIF, JPG, or PNG format.
There’s also a link in the logo area that you can
click to test whether your logo appears correctly
or not. If the logo appears in the pop-up window.
everything is fine. If not, double-check the URL.
7.
From your registered e-mail addresses, choose
the one you want to appear as the return
address on the invoice.
Again, if you have more than one address regis-
tered, you select the correct one from the drop-
down list.
8. Select the Send a Copy to Me check box if you
want to receive copies of all the invoices that
PayPal sends out for you.
FYI, getting these copies may get very old fast.
But give it a whirl for a while so you can see what
your buyers see.
9.
Click the Submit button at the bottom of the
page.
You’ll be notified that the invoicing service will
commence sometime within the next 24 hours.
eBay invoicing
eBay also allows you to send out invoices for your
items, but they’re not sent out automatically (as
they are by PayPal). For eBay invoices, you have a
couple of options:

From the item page: Invoices can be sent directly
from the item page, as shown in Figure 22-5. You
will see the Send Invoice bar only if you are signed
into eBay when you visit the auction.
• Figure 22-5: Click the Send Invoice button in the center
of the item page.

From My eBay: Go to My eBay, Items I’ve Sold
page, as shown in Figure 22-6. If the winner did
not pay for the item immediately through PayPal,
you’ll see a Send Invoice button in the Next Step/
Status column.
• Figure 22-6: My eBay status on Items I’ve Sold.

Tracking Payments
Y
ou’ve created a winning ad, run a successful auction or sale, noti-
fied the winner, and sent off an invoice. Now it’s time for the big
payoff: getting the money in hand for your item. eBay and PayPal
work in concert to offer several tools to notify you when a payment is
made.
The first place to check for payments is your My eBay Items I’ve Sold
page or eBay’s subscription-based Selling Manager. If you’re expect-
ing payments, be sure to check the page a couple of times a day.
When a buyer makes his or her payment, eBay updates your records
so that you know — and you can quickly ship the item to the buyer.
PayPal also sends you a Payment Received e-mail — but I have a few
caveats about using this form of notification. In this technique, I give you
the lowdown on getting paid fast and show you the pitfalls to avoid.
Tracking Payments through My eBay
eBay’s selling information tools, the My eBay page (for part-time sellers)
and eBay’s Selling Manager (for sellers moving up to 100 items a month),
give you a plethora of information on each of your transactions. The
most important of these features may just be instant notification when a
payment for an item has been received.
If you do not receive any form of notification of a payment received
from a buyer, check your PayPal account before taking the time and
trouble to send a Non-Paying Bidder notice. A new eBay buyer may
have misspelled your e-mail address or applied the payment to an
incorrect item number. If this is the case, simply e-mail the buyer and
ask that he or she cancel any payment made with the wrong item
number or e-mail address and then resubmit payment with the cor-
rect information.

Tracking payments from 
eBay’s Selling Manager
Selling Manager makes many selling processes con-
siderably easier. Take a look at Figure 23-2, my Selling
Manager Summary page. From here, you can see how
many buyers have paid for their purchases — and,
sadly, how many haven’t.
Here the Paid and Ready to Ship link in Figure 23-2
has the number 3 to the right of it; three items are
ready to ship. To see the details on these items, you
just click this link.
• Figure 23-2: My Selling Manager Summary.
When you arrive at the Sold Listings, Paid & Waiting
to Ship page, each transaction is listed, as in Figure
23-3. The bold dollar-sign icon to the right of a listing
confirms that a payment has been made.
After you ship the item, you can access the Sales
Status & Memo page shown in Figure 23-4 by clicking
the Record Number next to the item on the Sold
Listings page. Select the Shipped On check box and
enter the shipping date on this page. When you click
Tracking payments on your My eBay page
Once again, the Items I’ve Sold area of My eBay
comes to the rescue if you’re a beginning seller. As if
by magic, whenever one of your buyers makes a pay-
ment on your item through the PayPal service, your
My eBay page indicates that the item has been paid.
Take a look at Figure 23-1, and notice that the bot-
tom item shows it’s been paid for via PayPal.
• Figure 23-1: Items I’ve Sold reflecting a PayPal payment.
To confirm the information about a payment shown
in the Items I’ve Sold area of My eBay:
1.
Click the Paid via PayPal link in the item’s
listing.
You are taken to a PayPal login page.
2.
Sign in to PayPal with your password and click
Continue.
3.
The PayPal payment details screen appears,
giving you all the information on the purchase.
4.
When you finish reviewing the payment infor-
mation, click the Return to Log button at the
bottom to go to your Account History page.
From here you can transfer the money to your
bank account. (For more information about
PayPal banking features, see Technique 28.)
If you don’t want to do any other business using
your PayPal account, click the Log Out link at the
top-right of the page.

Tracking Payment
Info with PayPal
PayPal is the premier tool to use to verify a payment
before you panic that it hasn’t been made. They have
numerous methods of confirming payments, but you
need to make the final confirmation, yourself.
Payment notification via e-mail
When you receive a payment through PayPal, PayPal
sends you a payment confirmation e-mail. The e-mail
is a good tip-off that you’ve received a payment.
Notice I said good, but not infallible.
In these days of spoofed e-mail sent by scammers
to remove money from hard-working people’s wal-
lets, I rarely rely solely on e-mail confirmation. When
I receive one of these e-mails, I open my Internet
browser and go right to PayPal, www.PayPal.com
myself. Once I get to the PayPal Web site, log on, and
look at my PayPal Account Overview, I can confirm
with certainty that the payment has been made.
PayPal’s Post-Sale Manager
Post-Sale Manager is a super tool that just doesn’t
get enough credit. Unless he’s using a tool such as
Selling Manager or a third-party management soft-
ware, the beginning seller need look no further than
the PayPal Post-Sale Manager.
To use this tool, follow these steps:
1.
Open your browser and go to www.PayPal.com.
2.
Log in with your e-mail address and password.
The main PayPal Account Overview screen is
displayed. Under the line showing your PayPal
account balance, you’ll see a link labeled eBay
Items Sold.
3.
Click the link next to the eBay logo that indi-
cates Items Sold.
After a little whirring and grinding on your hard
drive’s part, you’ll see the Post-Sale Manager,
shown in Figure 23-5.
This truly useful tool lists all your recent eBay sales.
If the item has been paid via PayPal, the payment
will be noted here.
There are several columns in the Post-Sale Manager:

Select box: If you want to invoice a bunch of
sales all at once, put a check in this box, and
click the Invoice button at the bottom of the
page.

Item Number: This box contains a clickable link
to the actual item purchased on eBay. If you click
the link, the page opens in a second window, so
you still have access to the Post-Sale Manager.

Tracking Your
Shipments
S
hipping — what a joy! If you think packing the items is a pain, just
wait until your shipping company fumbles the ball and delays — or
loses — one of your shipments and your buyer gets on your case.
Getting the item out the door in a timely manner is your job. But for some
unknown reason, eBay buyers seem to think that sellers are responsible
for moving the package every inch of the way. You’re not. Once the pack-
age leaves your hands, either the Post Office, FedEx, or UPS determines
its fate.
You often have to lend a hand by tracking an item (often a painful task).
The package arrives in the recipient’s town and it’s on a truck. What truck,
you say? Who knows? You’re waiting for a shipment from your supplier —
you ran out of one of your stock items and you have orders coming in. You
have to know where your stuff is! Getting tracking information for your
shipments gives a bit of credence to the element of faith involved in the
very act of shipping.
Tracking the Mail
Here’s where you get thrown a curve. The United States Postal Service
only “tracks” truck-to-truck movements of Express Mail (without extra
fees) — that’s overnight shipping, government style. eBay buyers and
sellers rarely use overnight shipping, as the cost is extremely prohibitive.
The common mode of mailing identification for checking for delivery on
eBay packages is fee-based Delivery Confirmation. A bar-coded sticker is
either supplied at the Post Office or printed from your printer connected
to a USPS enabled site. Delivery Confirmation is available for just about
all classes of mail (First Class must be 3⁄4" at its thickest point to qualify),
and it lets you know whether a delivery has been attempted or whether
the package was delivered. That’s the extent of the tracking. The fees
vary based on the class of mail and whether you are using online postage
(see Technique 36 for how to get these at little or no cost).

FedEx Ground is becoming an increasingly popular,
cost-efficient mode of package transport among eBay
sellers. Coming from the back of the pack (ground
shipping is a comparatively new product of FedEx),
this service is becoming more and more reliable.
FedEx’s tracking is simple enough. Quickly track
packages by following these steps:
1.
Go to the FedEx home page at
www.fedex.com/us
In the middle of the home page, you’ll see a
Track Shipments box (as shown in Figure 24-7).
2.
Enter the tracking number or a Door Tag num-
ber (if supplied by a cranky buyer) in the track-
ing box.
You can find the door tag number on the tag left
at the buyer’s door when the FedEx driver
attempts a delivery.

Leaving Feedback
Quickly and
Gracefully
W
hen somebody asks me why eBay has become so popular, I say
it is largely due to the community’s participation in a feedback
system. In February of 1996, eBay’s founder, Pierre Omidyar,
proposed the feedback system to eBay’s 6-month-old community. After
personally ending up in the middle of a few member squabbles, he felt
that the community could police itself by leaving comments after trans-
actions. “Give praise where it is due; make complaints where appropri-
ate,” he posted on the eBay message board — and so it began.
Every eBay member, when participating in a transaction with another,
should provide a comment. If you don’t leave a comment, you’re really
not completing your transaction. Leaving feedback on eBay is the last bit
of paperwork you do to close a deal.
Here are some guidelines for participating in the feedback system:
1.
You may leave feedback for up to 90 days after a transaction 
completes.
2.
After you leave feedback, it cannot be retracted — you are
responsible and have to live with its contents for eternity.
3.
Keep your feedback businesslike and don’t make personal 
comments.
4.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you: If you have
a problem, try to work it out with the other party via e-mail or
phone before leaving negative feedback.
In Technique 4, I show how to evaluate a community member’s feedback
ranking. This technique shows how to leave your mark on the eBay sys-
tem by providing feedback about your transaction partners.

At the bottom of almost every eBay page, there is a
group of links. Click the one that reads Feedback
Forum, and you’ll be beamed to eBay’s feedback
Mecca, as shown in Figure 25-1.
• Figure 25-1: eBay’s Feedback Forum.
From this page, you can accomplish many feedback
related tasks:

View a Member’s Feedback: At the top of the
page, you can type in another user’s ID and you’ll
be presented with a member profile. (This method
is not quite as efficient as clicking the feedback
number next to a user’s name when you’re looking
at a transaction.)

Leave Feedback: This is a very handy and effi-
cient tool. If you click the Leave Feedback link,
you are taken to a page (or pages) that lists all
your outstanding transactions for the past 90
days. You may leave feedback for many transac-
tions at once from this area.

View My Member Profile: Click here to display a
page where you enter your User ID to access
your own feedback page. It’s a lot easier to click

feedback becomes part of the other person’s per-
manent record and affects his or her feedback
percentage).
If you prematurely left a positive comment
and the transaction goes to heck, you can also
leave your negative follow-up comment here.

Hide My Feedback: From here you make a set-
ting to hide your feedback record from other
eBay users. This is not a good idea. If people
can’t see your rating, they may not want to do
business with you. Hiding your feedback will gen-
erally lower the bids you get on your items.
Prospective buyers want to see your feedback!
If you’re trying to overcome some bad feed-
back comments by hiding your feedback,
you’ll be stymied. When you hide feedback, a
lousy feedback percentage will haunt you on
your transaction pages. A far better idea is to
participate in more transactions and get lots
more feedback of the positive kind!
Posting Feedback from 
Selling Manager
As you can tell if you’ve read any other part of this
book, I’m a big fan of Selling Manager. It essentially
condenses your eBay business into one command
central. Once you’ve heard from your trading part-
ner that all is well, you can quickly leave feedback
from your Selling Manager Summary page (see
Figure 25-4).
Here’s how to send feedback from Selling Manager:
1.
Click the Sold Listings: Paid and Waiting for

You arrive at the transaction listing of items wait-
ing for feedback.

You got an e-mail when the transaction ended, and

action is complete, you can use it to leave feedback
just prior to deleting the e-mail.
Here’s how to leave feedback from your e-mail:

Downloading Your
eBay Sales Reports
R
eports, reports, reports; when you’re active in the eBay selling com-
munity, you’re deluged with reports. Reports are grand because
they give you an idea of where your business is at any point in time.
But the key to getting some value out of all these reports is knowing which
reports are important to you, based on your levels of online selling.
When you’re just starting out, these reports can help you find the direction
for your business. But beware; delving into too many reports will make
your eyes glaze over and cause you to second-guess everything you do.
(My advice: Don’t make major changes in your selling plan because of
something you read in a report until you’re sure something isn’t working.)
eBay supplies some useful reports that give you a good snapshot of how
things are going. Once you’ve set up your business in earnest, I suggest
you graduate to a professional business tool to obtain even more sophisti-
cated reporting features. (See Technique 48 for more on business reports.)
eBay Selling Manager’s Reports
I like eBay’s Selling Manager because it gives you the opportunity to keep
all your selling information in one place. It also gives you downloadable
reports that you can archive for your business records.
You must subscribe to the Selling Manager product to get these
reports. There is a $4.99 per month fee. The benefits of the product
are mentioned throughout this book; it’s an excellent choice for the
beginning eBay seller.
Your eBay sales reports include important information about your trans-
actions and download in a spreadsheet format. Here is the information
you can expect to find in the reports you download:

Sales Record Number: This is the number assigned to the transaction
by Selling Manager for identification purposes.

Notes to Yourself: If you input any personal notes
regarding the transaction in the Sales Record,
they appear here.
Keep in mind that Selling Manager reports are

Notice that there is no column reflecting the eBay
fees you paid for listing and selling the item. If you
have plenty of time on your hands, you can create
another column and input the fees from your eBay
invoice for each individual item. Save time by bulk
posting the monthly total in your bookkeeping pro-

If you like, when the Save As dialog box
appears, rename the file to reflect the sales
month and year, as pictured in Figure 26-3.
It’s a good idea to create a directory on your
computer with a name such as eBay Sales. In
this directory, you can store all the reports you
download from eBay, PayPal, or any other
online service. Be sure to include this directory
when you perform regular data backups.

You can perform all spreadsheet tasks men-
tioned here in similar fashion in either Micro-
soft Works or Excel.
To total a spreadsheet column:
1.
Click in the blank cell at the bottom of the col-
umn you want to total.
2.
Click the AutoSum button.
3.
Click and drag over the cells you want to sum.
But Excel has probably already done this for you.
4.
Press Enter, and the total appears.
If you want to total the columns next to the one you
just totaled, you don’t have to re-input the formula.
Just highlight the results box from your last formula
and highlight boxes in the same row that you want
to contain totals of the columns.
As shown in Figure 26-6, then choose Edit➪Fill➪Right.
• Figure 26-6: Totaling the columns.
This copies the formula to the connecting boxes
and all the columns are totaled, as shown in Fig-
ure 26-7.
Now you can open the new file in your spreadsheet
program, and it will look very similar to Figure 26-5.
• Figure 26-5: My January 2004 eBay sales report.
Customizing a Works 
or Excel Spreadsheet
With simple spreadsheet commands, you can cus-
tomize the look of your report. For example, if the
column for Buyer Country is unnecessary for your
records (you ship only within the United States, so
the information is not useful), you can delete the
column.
To delete the wasted space:
1.
Highlight the column by clicking the column
letter.
2.
Choose Edit➪Delete.
Voilá! The offending column is no more.
The spreadsheet generated by Selling Manager is
much more useful if you total up the columns. That
way, you can see your total sales at a glance.

Your eBay Stores Sales Reports
If you have an eBay Store (if you don’t now — you
will after reading this book!) you get monthly reports
from eBay. The previous month’s reports arrive by
e-mail around the 15th of the following month. You’ll
find an ever-popular CSV file included as an attach-
ment. This will handily import into a spreadsheet
program.
These reports differ from the Selling Manager reports
considerably. While the Selling Manager reports give
you accounting data, your eBay Stores reports give
you an idea of sales trends by showing you sales
ratios and data.
Here’s the information you get:

Total Items Sold

Total Sales Amount for the Month: Pretty self-
explanatory, huh?

Auction Data: Sales broken down by eBay cate-
gory including the following data:
 # of Listings

 Quantity of Items Listed
 Quantity of Items Sold
 # of Bids


Auction Ratios: Listings separated into eBay 
categories, noting each category’s ratios:
 % of Successful Listings

Technique
Reporting Failed
Transactions 
to eBay
T
here comes a time in all eBay sellers’ lives when a transaction
seems to be going nowhere. Payment isn’t made, e-mail after e-mail
goes either unanswered or answered with excuses: “I’ll send you
payment next week when I get paid.” “You didn’t get my money order? I
sent it last week.” (Sound at all familiar?)
Here’s a typical horror story: “I’ve been having trouble with my bank lately,
it’s a small bank and I live out in the country — I’m sure the eCheck will
clear any day now,” a buyer told me recently. For two weeks, I saw a pend-
ing, constantly delayed eCheck in my PayPal account. The payment never
cleared, and PayPal unceremoniously cancelled the pending payment to
my account in a few days, with no reason or explanation. Puzzled, I went
back to the transaction and checked the buyer’s feedback rating. Boy,
had it changed. Eight negative feedbacks in a row, and the sellers didn’t
hold back:

“Paid with a fraudulent account. I lost 18.50 & my fountain pump! JERK!”

“STOLEN BANK ACCOUNT! Lost over $100 from this Person! eBay—->
Get her off!!”

“STOLEN BANK ACCOUNT confirmed by PayPal! LOST Over $25 Bad
eBayer, Get her OFF!”

“Bad eBayer stolen bank account cheated me out of $32.00 do not 
trust !!”

“Notified by PayPal that she’s using a FRAUDULENT bank account, I
lost $15.99”
Knowing When a Transaction 
Has Gone Wrong
The lesson to be learned is that when you’re being put off — or are wait-
ing inordinately long for a payment — go to the buyer’s feedback. You
may just get some hints about how the transaction will go.

Filing a Non-Paying Buyer Alert
171
A clear tip-off to a possible problem is when a
buyer with low feedback has an unconfirmed
address with PayPal. Be sure to check these
out before you ship. PayPal Seller Protection
does not protect you when you ship to an
unconfirmed address.
Other times, your buyer may just disappear: no e-mail,
no responses to phone calls (should you choose to
contact your buyer by phone). It’s money out the
window.
You can get the registered telephone number
of anyone with whom you are currently
involved in a transaction by going to the eBay
Search page. Click the link that says Find
Members. On the Find Members page, scroll
down to the Contact Info section. Type in the
item number and the other party’s User ID, and
eBay will send you an e-mail with the other
party’s telephone number. Your phone number
will also be sent via e-mail to the other party.
Before you completely give up on a transaction, be
sure you do the following:
1.
Send a payment reminder from your My eBay
page or Selling Manager.
2.
Try to contact the buyer via e-mail.
3.
Try to contact the buyer via phone (if the value
of the transaction warrants the additional
expense).
Filing a Non-Paying Buyer Alert
If you’re caught in a situation with a missing-in-action
buyer, eBay will refund a certain amount of your fee.
But you must follow the correct procedures.
When you decide to spend no more of your valuable
time chasing the buyer, follow these steps:
1.
Go to the following Web site:
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/
eBayISAPI.dll?NPBComplaintForm
2.
On this page, input the item number and click
Send Request.
3.
On the following page (shown in Figure 27-1), a
drop-down menu appears; use it to select the
reason for filing the alert.
4.
Click Submit to file the alert.
If your buyer has given you a good enough sob
story that you’re willing to forgive the entire
transaction (they clicked Buy It Now in your
store four times because they didn’t think it
worked the first three), you can select Both
parties mutually agreed not to complete the
transaction. This way, your buyer’s reputation
won’t get a ding, and you can file for your
Final Value Fee refund in 10 days.
• Figure 27-1: Selecting a reason for the Non-Paying Buyer
Alert.
After you file the alert, the buyer receives an e-mail
something like the one shown in Figure 27-2. A copy
of this e-mail is also sent to you. This e-mail will
often get the MIA buyer moving — and then again, it
might not.
You must file a Non-Paying Buyer Alert no ear-
lier than 7 days and no later than 45 days after
the transaction ends.

Technique 27: Reporting Failed Transactions to eBay
172
Your listing fees are not refunded, but if you relist
the item and it sells, eBay gives you a credit for the
listing fees.
Alternatively, you can also offer the item to an under-
bidder by using the Second Chance Offer (as
described in Technique 12).
To file for your Final Value Fee credit, go to
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/
eBayISAPI.dll?CreditRequest
where you can fill out and submit the form.
When a Final Value Fee is credited to you, a
Non-Paying Buyer Alert is generated on the
buyer’s eBay record. eBay takes these Non-
Paying Buyer Alerts seriously. When three have
been filed against a buyer, that person may be
permanently suspended from trading on eBay.
If somehow, magically, the buyer contacts you
to make amends, you may expunge the alert
from his or her permanent eBay record by
going to this page:
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/
eBayISAPI.dll?RemoveNPBWarningShow
• Figure 27-2: An NPB e-mail.
If, after putting this blemish on the buyer’s record,
you still get nowhere, you can proceed to the next
step — applying for the Final Value Fee credit.
The Next Step: Your Final 
Value Fee Credit
When ten days have elapsed after filing the Non-
Paying Buyer Alert, you may file for a refund of your
Final Value Fee for that transaction.

Understanding
PayPal Accounts
and Options
I
n the early days of eBay, a typical online auction was a scary place. You
could send a check to your trading partner, but the wait for the product
could be interminable. There was very little feedback in the beginning,
so you couldn’t separate the good sellers from the bad. The most widely
accepted form of payment was a money order. Somehow, we weren’t
afraid, in our small (but growing) community, to send money orders to
strangers. Heck, some sellers even shipped the merchandise before the
payment was received! Things were a lot simpler, if riskier, in the old days.
Then, rising like a beacon on the horizon came x.com. A brilliant man
named Elon came up with the concept of e-mailing money; you could
even beam cash to someone’s Palm Pilot! There was no charge for using
this service, which was even more amazing! The best part about signing
up for the new program was that they gave you a $20 credit just to join. If
you got friends to join, you got a $10 bonus for each and every friend. (The
maximum any x.com user could get in bonuses was $1,000, but hey, that’s
no small change!)
With numbers like that, the early eBay (née AuctionWeb) crowd signed
up quickly. x.com quickly became the most widely used service on the
Internet — the first mover-and-shaker in online, person-to-person
payments.
Here Comes eBay
The emerging eBay countered, acquiring Billpoint during spring 1999 in
hopes of launching its own payment service (in a partnership with Wells
Fargo). In a disaster of bad timing, the service was not available to eBay
members until the second quarter of 2000. Meanwhile, newcomer PayPal
(x.com reborn with a new name) was growing by leaps and bounds — and
quietly taking over the market.
PayPal went public in February 2002 to an encouraging Wall Street. The
feud between PayPal and Billpoint heated up. The number of customers who
signed up with Billpoint couldn’t keep pace with the numbers joining PayPal.
PayPal posted a profit, while Billpoint was losing millions every year.

without delay. If you want to send a transfer, you
must have a credit or debit card registered with
PayPal as a back-up for your funds — just in case
your bank denies the transfer. It’s like writing a
very secure check — without exposing any of
your personal information (such as your checking
account number) to another party.

eCheck: Sending an eCheck isn’t as “instant” as
an Instant Transfer. As with writing a check from
your checking account, it can take up to 4 days
for the eCheck to clear. You do not need a back-
up source of funds when you use eCheck.

PayPal balance: If someone has sent you money
through PayPal, or if you’ve sold something on
eBay and your buyer has paid you through
PayPal, you will have an amount deposited to
your PayPal account. This balance will first be
applied to any purchases, once there is no bal-
ance in your account, then you can choose to
pay by credit card. It’s simplest to keep your
books balanced if you withdraw any PayPal bal-
ance to your business checking account before
you make a purchase.

Credit Card: Charge-it! Putting your PayPal pur-
chases on a credit card is a good idea. Not only
are you protected by PayPal, but your credit-card
company also backs you up in the case of fraud.
You can register multiple credit cards on your
PayPal account, and select a different one for
different types of purchases. That way you can
place personal purchases on one account and
business purchases on another. It makes end-
of-year bookkeeping a whole lot easier!
Figuring out the payment types
PayPal also breaks types of payments into categories
based on what you’re paying for. You can pay for
almost anything in the world on the PayPal system
(as long as the recipient has an e-mail address).
After you sign into your PayPal account, you have
several ways to send money through PayPal:
In July 2002, eBay bit the bullet and acquired the mas-
sive PayPal in a deal valued at $1.5 billion. Billpoint
was then simply phased out of the site.
If you’ve read any of my books, you know that
I’ve been a huge fan of PayPal from the begin-
ning. PayPal is one of the safest and least
expensive ways for a vendor to accept money
over the Internet. For a small retailer, PayPal
fees can be much more cost effective than a
credit card merchant account (as I explain in
the next section).
Understanding How 
PayPal Works
Joining PayPal is just the beginning. No, they don’t
give $10 bonuses for sign-ups any more, but the bene-
fits far outweigh any fees they charge to sellers. Also,
there’s no charge to send money to anyone. As of
this writing, a seller just starting out can still accept
money from eBay sales and not incur any fees at all.
Before planning on a free ride from PayPal,
double-check the PayPal Web site (www.
PayPal.com) for any changes in fees and 
policies.
You may have up to eight e-mail addresses reg-
istered with a PayPal account. Note, however,
that you may not register an e-mail address if
it’s already registered with another PayPal
account.
Sending money through PayPal
You can fund the money you send to another party
via PayPal in several ways:

Instant Transfer: Sending money this way means
the money will be immediately credited to the
recipient’s account. That person can then transfer
the money to his or her personal bank account

PayPal’s Protection Plans
177

Paying for eBay Items: When you pay for an
eBay item, you input the item number and your
eBay User ID so that the payment will integrate
directly with eBay’s user records.

Auction Goods (off-eBay): With this option, you
must input the URL for the item you purchased, as
well as the auction site. You can even compose a
message for the seller.

Goods (other): Use this option when you need
to send money to anyone in the world for goods
purchased anywhere other than in an online
auction.

Service: You can also make a payment for a serv-
ice performed for you or your business, such as
Web design, bookkeeping, psychic readings, or
whatever.

Quasi-Cash: Use this when you need to send
money to your kid in college (or pay back your
roommate for saving you from great embarrass-
ment when you left your wallet at home on a
double date).
When using the Quasi-Cash feature, consider
using a payment method other than credit
card to avoid possible credit card fees for a
cash advance.
PayPal’s Protection Plans
Safety — isn’t that what paying for things online is all
about? Safety for the buyer and safety for the seller
are primary concerns in the minds of those dealing
on eBay.
So what has PayPal done? They have created protec-
tion policies for both parties.
PayPal Buyer Protection
As a buyer who pays for his or her eBay items
through PayPal, you can be covered against “fraud”
for up to $500. You have to be sure that the seller’s
item has the PayPal Protection Shield (shown in
Figure 28-1) next to the PP PayPal icon to get this
Buyer Protection.
Fraud, in this protection program, is loosely defined
as non-delivery of items, or receipt of an item that’s
significantly different from the way it was described.
(Sorry — this doesn’t cover you when you’re merely
disappointed with an item when you open the box.)
• Figure 28-1: The PayPal Protection Shield.
Notice, when you’re browsing eBay, that PayPal
icons accompany some listings. Some listings have
just the PP PayPal icon, some have the PP icon and
the Shield, and some have no icon at all. Here’s what
these mean:

PP Icon: The seller accepts PayPal as payment,
and you’re covered under eBay’s Standard
Purchase Protection (up to $200 with a $25
deductible).

PP Icon and Shield: This means the seller has
qualified for his or her listings to be covered
under the full Buyer Protection Program (cover-
age of up to $500).

No icon: The seller for the item accepts no PayPal
payments, but you are still covered by eBay’s
Standard Purchase Protection. See Technique 7
for more details.
Figure 28-2 shows a detail of eBay listings with these
icons displayed.

Technique 28: Understanding PayPal Accounts and Options
178
PayPal Seller Protection
Don’t think that sellers get left out of this protection
thing. You do have some protection against unwar-
ranted claims made on your eBay sales. It’s called
Seller Protection.
To see whether your transaction is covered under
Seller Protection, follow these steps:
1.
Open your “payment received” e-mail from
PayPal and look for the link titled View the
Details of the Transaction.
2.
Click the link and sign into your PayPal
account.
3.
Scroll down the Transaction Details page to the
buyer’s shipping address.
You will see whether the shipping address is con-
firmed. (PayPal checks to be sure the credit card
billing address matches the shipping address to
confirm it.) If it is, you must ship to that address
to be protected.
When your transaction is protected, should there be
any fraud involved (stolen credit card or identity
hoax) you will not lose the money. PayPal guaran-
tees the transaction.
If you receive a PayPal payment that ships to
an unconfirmed address, drop the buyer a note
and ask about the address. Usually you’ll get a
reply that makes you feel comfortable, and
you’ll ship. Remember that you will not be
covered under Seller Protection if you ship to
an unconfirmed address.
Surprise! There are a few other rules and restrictions.
For sellers to be protected, they must meet the follow-
ing requirements:

Verified Business or Premier Account. They must
have an upper-level PayPal account.

Ship to confirmed address. They must ship to
the buyer’s address exactly as displayed on the
Transaction Details page.
• Figure 28-2: eBay listings with (and without) PayPal icons.
Even if PayPal’s Buyer Protection does not cover
your item, you may still be able to get a refund
if you’ve been defrauded. The PayPal Protection
Shield in the Seller Information box (or in the
listings) merely tells you that the seller main-
tains a level of professionalism and safety in his
or her sales. Read about seller’s qualifications a
little later in this technique (under “Getting
qualified for a Protection Shield”).
There are a few rules for using the protection system
and making claims:

Number of claims: You may make only one claim
per PayPal payment. (If you pay for multiple items
at once your total claim may not be over $500.)
You also may not file more than two claims per
calendar year.

Timing: Your claim must be made within 30 days
of your PayPal payment.

Participation: You must be ready and willing 
to provide information and documentation to
PayPal’s Buyer Protection team during the claims
process.

PayPal’s Protection Plans
179

Ship within 7 days. The item should leave 
the sellers’ place of business within 7 days of
receiving payment.

Single payment/single account. Sellers accept
one payment from one PayPal account for the
purchase.

Ship tangible goods. Seller Protection is not
available for services, digital goods, and other
electronically-delivered items.

Proof of shipping. Sellers must provide reason-
able proof of shipment which can be tracked
online. The Transaction Details page must show
that the seller shipped to the buyer’s address. A
Delivery Confirmation will suffice for items val-
ued up to $250.00.
For items worth $250.00 or more (£150.00 or
more for the U.K.), sellers must have a signa-
ture from the recipient as proof of receipt.

No surcharges. Sellers cannot impose a sur-
charge on the buyer. This is against eBay policy
anyway. (Surcharging for any PayPal payment is
prohibited outside the U.K.)

Complaint investigation. If a complaint is filed,
sellers must provide complete information about
a transaction within 7 days of a request from
PayPal.
If PayPal is required by the buyer’s issuing
credit card company to respond immediately
to resolve a chargeback situation, the seller
must provide all information within 3 days.
At this writing, Seller Protection is available only for
U.S. or Canadian sellers transacting with U.S. buyers,
and for U.K. sellers transacting with U.K. or U.S. buy-
ers. Check back with the PayPal site for any changes
in this policy.
Getting qualified for a Protection Shield
What if you want to provide protection for your
buyers? It’s a way to show them you’re professional
and have them feel more comfortable making pur-
chases from you.
For a seller to qualify his or her items for Protec-
tion Shield status, the seller has to meet a few
requirements:

Must have a minimum of 50 or more eBay feed-
back comments.

Must have at least 98-percent-positive eBay 
feedback.

Must be a Verified member of PayPal.

Must use a Premier or Business PayPal account
to accept payments.

Must have a U.S. or Canadian PayPal account.

Must select PayPal as a payment option when
listing items on eBay.

Must have a PayPal account that’s in good 
standing.
What’s this “PayPal Verified” 
business all about?
Being PayPal Verified is an important rating for both seller
and buyer. It means that someone has checked, and that
you really are who you say you are. (Remember when you
signed up at the bank? They got information about you to
be sure you were you, didn’t they?)
Becoming verified isn’t a big deal. All you have to do is reg-
ister your checking account with PayPal. PayPal will make
two teeny (under $1) deposits into your checking account.
When they’ve been transferred to your account, you can
log back onto your PayPal account and confirm the two
amounts. That’s it — and you get free pennies too!
If you live outside the United States, you become verified by
adding a credit card to your account and enrolling in the
Expanded Use Program. (It’s a similar confirmation scheme.)

Technique 28: Understanding PayPal Accounts and Options
180
All U.S. Premier and Business accounts that
receive more than $2,000 a month in pay-
ments through PayPal have an additional
requirement: Holders of such accounts must
supply PayPal with additional information
about their businesses.
PayPal has two levels of rates, a Merchant Rate and a
Standard Rate, as shown in Table 28-1. When you
open your account, you will be charged the Standard
Rate. When your sales grow and you’ve been receiv-
ing over $1,000 per month through PayPal for three
consecutive months, you can apply for a Merchant
Rate.

Remember: If you receive a payment from a buyer in
another country, there is an additional fee — 1 per-
cent for payments in U.S. dollars, and 0.5 percent for
Canadian dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, and Yen.
(This fee is currently waived for Canadian sellers
receiving payments from U.S. buyers.)
If your transaction requires a currency conver-
sion, you are charged an exchange rate. This
includes an additional 2.5 percent above the
current exchange rate.
Comprehending PayPal’s
Accounts
PayPal has three different types of accounts to
accommodate everyone from the casual seller to the
professional business.
PayPal Personal Account
When you begin your career with PayPal, you may
want to sign up for a Personal account. With this
basic account from PayPal, you can send and receive
money (non–credit card payments) for free.
PayPal Personal accounts are for one person only
and not for a business. You cannot have a joint
Personal account, either.
Business and Premier Accounts
The PayPal professional seller accounts allow you to
accept credit card payments, get a debit card, and
participate in PayPal’s high-yield money market
fund. A Premier Account is held in an individual’s
name (although it may still be for a business); a
Business Account can be held in a business name
and allows multiple login names.
Once you reach these account levels, you’ll have
access to a customer service phone number, and be
able to use all the PayPal tools discussed in other
techniques in this part.
There is a fee levied on all money you receive through
PayPal at this level, but the costs are reasonable.
(Just ask anyone with a brick-and-mortar business
that accepts credit cards.)

Generating Income
from Your Web 
Site with PayPal
I
f you think that PayPal is only for your eBay business, think again!
Prior to eBay purchasing PayPal, approximately 15 percent of its rev-
enues came from online gaming. (Read: Gambling!) Since eBay took
over in late 2002, PayPal no longer draws revenue from this arena. And
there’s good news for us; today PayPal offers tools that you can use to
process PayPal payments on your own personal or business Web sites.
Aside from your eBay Store, you can sell directly from your own Web site
or from your AOL Hometown page. In time, as your business grows out-
side eBay to your own Web site, you’ll find that using PayPal as your pay-
ment provider is a great deal. You pay the same transaction fees — to
PayPal only — for processing your credit card sales.
Build business by including your Web site URL in your e-mail signa-
ture to let the world know you’re open for business 24/7. Your My
eBay page can also include links to your selling Web site — it’s fully in
line with the eBay rules!
In this technique, you discover how to make your own Web site an extra
revenue builder. I’m going to use my Web site as the example. It’s a very
basic Web site, but people can (and do) shop there from time to time.
Remember, any sale you make from your own Web site involves no eBay
fees, which means extra income for you.
Making the PayPal Payment Option
Available on Your Site
Once you get a few items in your garage or business location that you
stock in quantity, you’ve got the makings of your own Web store. Don’t
let the thought of this spook you. You can do this!
The first step for having your own online store is to create your Web 
site. After you have the site up and running, adding Buy Now buttons is
the most basic way to enable sales through PayPal from your site. These

computer whiz to create the links because PayPal
makes this almost automatic.
There’s no fee to use this service (other than the pro-
cessing fee when someone buys an item). All you
need is a Verified PayPal Premier or Business account.
When someone buys something from your Web site,
the procedure is the same as when someone pays
for an eBay item. You receive an e-mail from PayPal.
The e-mail subject includes the item number you’ve
assigned in your code (it can also be an item name,
as in Figure 29-1) and will let you know that it’s a
Web payment (versus an eBay payment) that has
been received.
• Figure 29-1: PayPal’s Web site accepted payment e-mail.
Creating a button from the PayPal Web site
If you want to save a bunch of time, try to use
the sample coding (you can do it — I know
you can!) in the section “Coding for Do-It-
Yourselfers.” Just customize the HTML coding
(with your Web site details) and put it into your
Web page. If it doesn’t work, or you’re too
nervous to do real coding, read this section
with the step-by-step process for placing the
PayPal button on your site.

Making the PayPal Payment Option Available on Your Site
183
Refer back to this list when you examine the
full sample code shown later in this technique.
It will help to explain what goes into each
input type field.
 Item Name: Type your item (or service) name.
 ID Number: Give your item an ID number or
Name.
I recommend giving your items both a number
and an abbreviated name. When PayPal sends
you an e-mail letting you know that someone
made a purchase, the item number/name will
appear in the subject line. For faster recognition,
I recommend that you use an abbreviation.
(For the longest time, I’d wonder what Item
Number 4 was!)
 Item Price: Enter the item price here (FYI,
there’s a $2,000 limit for new buyers).
 Currency: Decide what currency you’re will-
ing to accept for your purchases. (If you’re in
the U.S. — go for the dollars.)
 International Buyers: If you accept interna-
tional orders, specify here whether you want
your buyer’s payment page to default to a spe-
cific country.
If you don’t specify a default, buyers can
choose for themselves. I select the United
States to make it faster for most purchasers.
 Select a Button: Choose a Buy Now button 
to insert on your page. If you don’t like the
one pictured, click the Choose A Different
Button link to see more options, as shown 
in Figure 29-4.
I like the buttons that include the name PayPal,
because that may assure new shoppers that
their transactions with you will be secure. You
also have the opportunity to design your own
button, but hey, why make extra work for your-
self right now? Just set up a standard button
and get fancy later.
• Figure 29-4: Your choices for button selection.
Setting up your payment page
Now it’s time to make settings for the payment page
people will see when they’ve clicked your Buy Now
button. Follow these steps to do so:
1.
After you make settings in the Selling Single
Items page and choose a button to insert, click
Continue.
2.
Make your choices for the following settings:
 Options: Click the Add More Options box to
enter shipping and sales tax information for
your item.
 Shipping and Handling Fee: On the rest of
the form, select a flat shipping and handling
charge or one based on a percentage of the
item’s price.
Unfortunately, PayPal does not supply a cool
shipping calculator as eBay does. So you could
put a postal shipping chart on your item page
and let your buyers insert the proper shipping
amount, or you can enter an amount on this
page that lands somewhere in the middle of the
highest (furthest away) and lowest (closest)
shipping zone costs. You’ll lose a little on
some, but make it up on others.
 Sales Tax: Select your state and enter the
appropriate sales tax to be applied to your 
in-state purchases.
If you already have a sales tax provision in your
PayPal profile, it will automatically be listed
here. PayPal will automatically apply the sales
tax for sales that are shipped within your state.

 Optional Instructions: If you’d like your buyers
to be able to write you a note, click Yes in this
field.
That’s it for the options.
3.
Click Preview to see a sample of the page your
customer will see after making a Web payment
to you.
4.
If the page looks okay, click the Return button
to go back to the editing page.
5.
Click the Create Button Now button.
Whew. That’s all there is to creating your first Buy
Now button and the payment page that appears when
it’s clicked. When you get the hang of it, I’m sure you’d
rather code your own. It’s really easy (even I can do it)
and considerably faster. Read the next section.
Coding for Do-It-Yourselfers
Yes, there’s a short way and a proper way to do every-
thing. The easy way may not give you that unerring
air of professionalism, but it still works. Since I am
unreasonably busy, I did my Web site PayPal buttons
the easy way — without a bunch of options.
PayPal coding — the stripped-down version
The items I sell on my Web site can’t be combined in
one box. Each has to be shipped in individual boxes,
and postage must be charged for each item. I there-
fore don’t use the shopping cart method.
Figure 29-6 shows a payment button on one of the
pages on my site. When the mouse rolls over the
payment button, a PayPal message appears.
• Figure 29-6: My PayPal payment button.
 Item Options: If your item has options (if, for
example, it comes in different sizes or colors),
you can create a custom drop-down menu for
your payment page so the customer can
choose; just type the offered options in this box.
 Insert Your Logo: To add a logo to your pay-
ment page, type in the URL where the logo file
is stored. PayPal will place the logo on your
payment page.
The logo you use must be sized at 150 x 50
pixels, or PayPal won’t accept it.
 Payment Landing Page: If you want your 
customers to land on a specific page after
they’ve made a payment — for example, set-
ting up a thank-you page on your Web site is 
a nice idea — you enter that URL here. Fig-
ure 29-5 shows a portion of my Web site’s
very basic thank-you page. The page also has
links to take the buyer back to my Web site.
• Figure 29-5: Thanks for buying my item!
 Cancel Transaction Page: If you want to
include a page where people are taken if they
cancel the transaction before completing it,
you can insert that address here. If you don’t
specify a page, they will land at a PayPal Web
page.
 Quantity: If you’d like your customers to be
able to purchase more than one of your item
at a time, you may indicate that here. The
buyers will then be able to fill in a number in 
a quantity field.
 Shipping Address: Click yes if you’d like the
customer’s shipping address. I guess it would
be kind of useless not to ask for a shipping
address when you’re expected to ship the
item somewhere, huh? Including this field
does kind of take the guesswork out of things!

When you click the Payment button, you land on my
Cool eBay Tools PayPal payment page (shown in Fig-
ure 29-7, complete with custom logo). The PayPal
payment page is a secure page directly from PayPal.
These pages contain a small icon of a lock, which
indicates that the site is safe for secure transactions.
The URL for the page begins with https; the s at the
end indicates that the site is secure.

Downloading Your
Payment History
from PayPal
I
’ve been running a home-based business since the mid-1980s. Because
I came from a corporate background working in the newspaper busi-
ness, I’ve always known that record keeping is important. But record
keeping has always been the bane of my existence. The first thing I did,
when I began my home-based business, was to hire a lawyer and a CPA to
teach me what I had to do.
Record keeping means keeping track of everything: every penny, sou, far-
thing, or ruble that you spend or take in. Here, in the United States (and
in most other countries), we have a little thing called taxes. We all have
to turn in tax returns of several sorts when we run a business — and
they’d better be correct. There may come a day in the near (or hopefully,
far) future when we, as online businesspeople, will receive a letter from a
State or Federal tax agency asking to take a look at our books. This is
simply a nice way of saying the dreaded word, AUDIT.
The best defense against an audit is to have backup records. The more
records you have proving your business income and expenses, the
less painful your audit will be. One excellent piece of information to
have at your fingertips is your PayPal history.
Besides meeting tax-reporting requirements, keeping good records keeps
you on top of your business dealings. See Techniques 47 and 48 for more
about how good record keeping helps your business succeed. PayPal
helps you with this all-important record keeping by providing customiz-
able, downloadable reports on your buying and selling activity.
PayPal’s Downloadable Reports
PayPal allows you to customize and download your transaction reports
at any time. You might want to consider downloading your reports on a
monthly or quarterly basis — as well as generating one big report at the
end of the year. You may want to download the reports to coincide with
your state sales tax payments (for backup documentation) or to keep a
record of your monthly totals.

quality information. (Check out Technique 47 for
the timesaving way to post your information
without overloading the program.)
3.
Click the Download My History link.
You now land on the Download History page. But,
before you start clicking anything else, you
should consider customizing your reports.
4.
If you decide to customize reports (which I rec-
ommend), click the link labeled Customize My
History Download.
See the next section for information on your
choices.
5.
If you decide not to customize, you can skip
ahead to the steps in the section “Doing the
Actual Download (Finally!).”
Customizing Your Download
You may need all the information that PayPal gives
you. If that’s what you want, that’s great. But PayPal
can give you information overkill. I suggest that you
look over the following list of available info so you
can pick and choose the fields to download and keep
in your permanent records.
All your downloadable PayPal reports can contain
the following information by default:

Date: The date each PayPal transaction occurred.

Time: The time the payment was made.

Time Zone: The time zone used for recording
transactions in your PayPal account.

Name: The name of the person to whom you sent
money or from whom you received money.

Type: The type of transaction that occurred:
Deposit, Withdrawal, ATM Withdrawal, Payment
Sent, Payment Received, and so on.

Status: The status of the transaction at the time
you download the file (Cleared, Completed,
Denied, and so on).
You can download reports in several formats. The
most flexible is a comma-delimited file that can be
opened and edited in a spreadsheet program, such
as Excel or Microsoft Works.
By using a spreadsheet file as your record of
customers, you won’t bog down a bookkeep-
ing program with hundreds (and eventually
thousands) of records of one-time buyers. Even
a robust program like QuickBooks will max
out at around 14,000 customers!
Starting the Download 
from PayPal
To get your reports from PayPal, you need to go to
www.PayPal.com and log on to your account with
your e-mail address and password. After you’re
logged on, the top of the page displays various tabs,
as shown in Figure 30-1.
• Figure 30-1: The PayPal navigation tab bar.
Now follow these steps:
1.
Click the My Account tab.
2.
Click the History item on the navigation bar.
You are now in your account History area; on the
right you’ll see a box entitled Reporting Tools.
In that area are a few options, including
Download My History and Merchant Sales
Report. The Merchant Sales Report is a nice tool,
but if you’re posting your sales regularly to a
program such as QuickBooks, you’ll have reports
out the wazoo that’ll give you tons of higher

Customizing Your Download
189

Gross: The Gross amount involved in the trans-
action (before any fees are deducted).

Fee: Any PayPal fees that are charged to the
transaction.

Net: The net dollar amount of the transaction.
(This is the total received, less any PayPal fees.)

From e-mail: The e-mail address of the sender.

To e-mail: The e-mail address of the recipient.
If you use different e-mail addresses to classify
different types of sales, this can be a good
sorting point for your reports. For example, I
receive payments for my personal auctions at
one e-mail address and payments for my busi-
ness at another.
PayPal has lots more data that you can have, too.
You can set the options listed here separately for
your eBay sales and your Web site sales (where peo-
ple use your PayPal Buy Now button to make a pur-
chase). If you want more information from one type
of sale than from the other, you can set these
options appropriately.

Item ID: This is that strange combination of let-
ters and numbers that PayPal assigns to each
transaction. Decide whether this is important for
your own records. (I don’t use it.)

Item Title: The title of the auction related to the
transaction.

Shipping Amount: The amount the buyer paid
for shipping. It’s a good idea to use this field, as
it helps you to separate merchandise revenue
from shipping revenue.

Auction Site: If you’re collecting money from
other auction sites through PayPal, you might
want to include this link so that you can sort
your sales by auction site.

Item URL: The Internet address of the auction or
transaction. (For eBay, the URLs are on the site
for up to 90 days — here you can go back a year.)

Closing Date: The date the transaction closed.
The record will always contain the date the pay-
ment posted to your PayPal account, whether
you indicate closing date here or not.

Shipping Address: The address to which the item
was shipped.

Counter Party Status (Verified versus Unverified):
A record of whether your buyer was PayPal
Verified.

Address Status (Confirmed versus
Unconfirmed): Shows whether the 
address you shipped to was confirmed.

Sales Tax: Information about sales tax you 
collected.
After you’ve selected the fields you want to include
(by selecting the check box next to the desired data),
click Save. You find yourself back at the Download
History page, as shown in Figure 30-2. Your custom-
ization will be saved for future report downloads.
• Figure 30-2: Downloading your permanent records.
If you are a seller in the UK, your Download
History page will look slightly different than the
one pictured. Your dates will be in the format of
DD/MM/YY. U.S. users read their dates with
the month first, the day, and then the year; UK
users read the day, month, and then the year.

remember, once these files get imported,
they’re in your bookkeeping format for good.
Saving these report files for spreadsheet use
will not limit you in the future as to what ver-
sion of which program will open what. .txt
and .csv are universal files and can be
opened on any PC with basic spreadsheet
capabilities.
3.
After you specify dates and format, click the
Download History button.
If you’ve asked for a long timeframe (like a year),
get up and make yourself a cup of joe. When you
come back, your file will be ready to download.
Saving and Editing Your Reports
When your computer finally is ready to receive the
downloaded file (which may take a while — especially
if you have a dial-up connection), a window pops up
like the one shown in Figure 30-4.
• Figure 30-4: The Windows File Download window.
Click the Save button and, in the next screen, select
the directory on your computer where you want to
save the file. I recommend setting up a directory that
contains only Internet and eBay sales files.
Doing the Actual
Download (Finally!)
On the Download History page, follow these steps to
download a report:
1.
Type in the dates that you’d like to have cov-
ered in the downloaded report.
2.
Select a format for your download from the 
following:
 Comma-delimited file: This type of file down-
loads with the extension .csv. You can open a
comma-delimited file easily in Microsoft Excel
or Microsoft Works. (Microsoft Works doesn’t
have a direct .csv importer, but the file will
open under the All Files (*.*) option as shown
in Figure 30-3.)
• Figure 30-3: Opening a csv file in Works.
 Tab-delimited file: This file downloads with
the extension of .txt. You can open it in a
spreadsheet program, or as a text file in Win-
dows Notepad or a word-processing program
such as Microsoft Word.
 Quicken or QuickBooks file: PayPal reports
download in the native format ready to import
into these Intuit bookkeeping programs,
which I discuss in Technique 47. Just 

Saving and Editing Your Reports
191
After you save the file, you can open it. Figure 30-5
shows a downloaded history file opened in Microsoft
Works. You can now work with your sales history to
your heart’s content — re-sorting the records, totaling
up sales, deleting unnecessary columns, and so on.
This file is now part of your eBay business archive,
should the day come that you need to produce it. Be
sure to back it up, just in case.
Some CPAs recommend you keep these files
for up to 7 years but, to be safe, check with
your own tax professional who understands
the needs for your particular tax situation.

Technique
Arranging Shipping
Directly through
PayPal
I
consider PayPal to be de rigueur (a ‘must have’, to all you non-French
speakers) for all eBay sellers. By using PayPal, a seller can streamline
the buyer’s shopping experience, making it simple to buy, click, and
pay. Those out in the eBay world who haven’t used PayPal find using the
service to be a life-changing experience. Along with all its timesaving
tools for the seller, PayPal now offers online shipping services through
the United States Postal Service (USPS) or UPS at no extra charge. This
technique shows you how to take advantage of this incredibly conven-
ient system. Shipping through PayPal is especially helpful for those who
don’t ship many packages per week because there’s no need to use addi-
tional software or sign up with an additional service.
But (I hate the buts, don’t you?), the PayPal postage system can make
bookkeeping a nightmare for large-scale shippers. That’s because
PayPal withdraws the postage amounts directly from your PayPal
account balance. This is problematic for keeping your books in bal-
ance: Your final deposits won’t match your posted eBay or Web sales.
You can make the bookkeeping end of the shipping process work
more efficiently by posting your PayPal sales to your bookkeeping
program and withdrawing your money (from your PayPal account)
prior to processing your shipping. Then, simply charge your shipping
to a credit card and make it easier to balance your books at month’s
end. See Technique 47 for more advice on professional bookkeeping.
Shipping Directly from PayPal
When you get those wonderful e-mails from PayPal letting you know that
someone has made a payment, it’s a great feeling. But it’s also your notice
that you’ve got to ship out our merchandise really soon. When you’re
ready to deal with shipping, it’s very simple to sign on to your PayPal
account and handle it right on the site.
In Figure 31-1, you see my PayPal Overview page. It’s clear that I have to
ship some items pronto.

• Figure 31-1: After signing in, you can see which items
need shipping.
To begin the shipping process
1.
Click the Ship button in the item’s row.
You’ll arrive at the page shown in Figure 31-2.
2.
Choose which method of shipping you’d like to
use: U.S. Postal Service or UPS.
• Figure 31-2: Choose your shipper!
I hope that you already decided which ship-
ping method to use prior to coming to PayPal.
You had to specify a shipping amount in your
auction, and it would be a tad awkward (and
possibly costly) to switch shippers now. If you
need help deciding which shipper to use,
please check out Part VI of this book.
PayPal Shipping with the USPS
If you plan to use the ever-popular United States
Postal Service (USPS), printing your postage and label
through PayPal gives you a free Delivery Confirmation
with Priority Mail. A Delivery Confirmation is also
available for Media Mail, Parcel Post, and First Class
Mail for a minimal charge. (For Priority Mail, that’s a
savings of about $.45 from walk-in post office rates.)
After you’ve chosen USPS as your shipper, you’ll
see a confirmation page similar to the one shown
in Figure 31-3. At the top of the page (not pictured)
your mailing address and the ship to address are
listed. 
• Figure 31-3: Confirming the details of your shipment.
After you confirm that this information is correct, fill
out the details of the form, including:

you want for your package from this drop-down
list. Priority Mail is usually the standard.

E-mail Message to Buyer: Customer service to
the fore! Type in a nice note letting customers
know you appreciate their business. This might
also be a good place to ask them to e-mail you
immediately if there are any problems with the
item when it arrives. (A good defense against
knee-jerk negative feedback.)

area will be the item number and name of the
item you are shipping.
If you’ve finished filling in the form and everything

Click Continue.
The USPS Shipping Confirmation page appears,
as shown in Figure 31-4. On the Shipping Confir-

ous page is listed.

Edit Shipment Details, or cancel the transaction
by clicking Cancel.
• Figure 31-4: Your USPS Shipping Confirmation page.

Package Size: From this drop-down menu, select
the type of package you’re sending. To decide
which packaging to select, keep the following 
in mind:
 Package/Thick Envelope: Your package or
envelope qualifies for this status if the length
and girth are no more than 84 inches.
 Large Package: Your package is a Large
Package when it is larger than the previous
category, but doesn’t exceed 108 inches in
combined length and girth.
 USPS Flat Rate Envelope: These handy
Express and Priority Mail envelopes are avail-
able free from the USPS. (See Technique 36 for
information on how to get them delivered to
your door.) You can ship whatever fits into
the envelopes at a flat rate, no matter how
much the package weighs.
If you really stuff your flat rate envelopes, you
can always reinforce your envelope with clear
shipping tape — I do!

Weight: Here you enter the weight of your pack-
age. (You may use your bathroom scale; or bet-
ter yet, buy a digital postage scale on eBay.)

Delivery Confirmation: Confirmation is free with
Priority Mail. Find more info on the DC (Delivery
Confirmation) in Technique 36.

Signature Confirmation: Signature confirmation
provides you a signature and date of delivery,
and is available for many levels of service. If you’d
like a signature confirmation for your package, 
it will add $1.30 to the postage cost. You can
request Proof of Delivery online or on the phone.

Display Value of Postage on Label: If you’d prefer
not to show the actual amount of the postage on
the label, do not check this box. That way, what-
ever handling fees you charge your customer are
transparent.

3.
Click Pay and Continue if everything looks
okay.
Your PayPal account is charged for the postage
amount and a new window opens to allow you 
to print postage on your printer. You have the
option of printing a sample label, which is a good
idea: You can print the sample to make sure that
your printer and all the connections are working
properly.
4.
After you print the sample and you’re happy
with the results, print the label by clicking
Print Label.
The label will look similar to the one in Figure 31-5.

You can now request a pickup from the post office

Shipping with UPS
Shippers such as UPS charge different rates based on
how often you use their services (see Technique 37
for this breakdown). If you’re shipping many packages
a week, it might be best if you printed your labels
directly from the UPS site. All PayPal UPS shipments
are charged the occasional shipper rate. If you use
UPS just once in a while, the PayPal method will work
perfectly for you.
If you’ve selected UPS as your shipper on the PayPal
Shipping page, you’ll arrive at a page with these
choices:

UPS Account: You can open a new UPS account
immediately online, or, if you have an existing UPS
account number, you may type it in this field.
To open a new account you’ll have to verify your
company data (it’s already entered here from
your PayPal account information) and let UPS
know approximately how many packages you
ship per week.

Shipping Payment Information: You also have
to indicate whether you’d like to pay for your
shipping with your PayPal account, or you’d like
the shipping billed to your existing UPS account.
When you’re through with these choices, finish the
shipping process with these steps:
1.
Click Continue.
2.
If any information on the resulting confirma-
tion page is wrong, press Edit to go back and
fix the erroneous entries.
3.
When all the information on the confirmation
page is correct, click Continue.
4.
Read the UPS Shipping Agreement (if you’re
opening a new account), and
 If you agree, click I Agree.
 If you don’t, click I Decline. Then you can go
back and ship via the USPS.

• Figure 31-6: Your PayPal Overview page after shipping.
Now you’re ready to print a label. Fill out the
requested information and progress in the same
manner as for USPS shipping, which I described in
the preceding section.
When your label has printed, you may elect to go
back to your PayPal Overview page, as shown in
Figure 31-6. The items you’ve selected to ship will
include a Track Package button, and the charges for
your shipment will appear in your history log. You
may click the Track Package button at any time after
you’ve shipped your item to track the package’s
progress and confirm delivery.

Expanding Your
Business with PayPal
Shops and Tools
B
efore PayPal joined eBay, they were pulling out every trick in the
book to get members. The company was founded with a real desire
to give customers plenty of extras for their loyalty, as I explain
throughout this part. They have tons of tools to enhance the seller’s online
selling experience. The tools and the prices charged by PayPal truly are
unmatched by any other online payment service. This technique fills you
in on a couple more really cool tools from PayPal.
Joining PayPal Shops
The best part of joining PayPal Shops is that there is no cost to you. A
PayPal Shop is really not a separate online store, but a link from the PayPal
mall (so to speak) to a unique group of shops. Over 40 million PayPal
members may browse this area at any time — so why not avail yourself
of this free marketing opportunity? The shop can link to your eBay Store,
or you can link to your PayPal-enabled business Web site. Think of it as a
way to double your store’s visibility on the Web without spending more
in fees. Your store will be listed in the PayPal Shops directory, as shown
in Figure 32-1.
Notice that the PayPal hub has categories (down the left side of the page)
and a shop search. The categories whittle down into subcategories, just
like at eBay. Except, unlike at eBay, you won’t find any sub-subcategories.
I used the search box to find some innocuous, pretty things and came up
with the search results shown in Figure 32-2. Notice that there is a number
next to each store name. No, it’s not the seller’s feedback rating; it’s the
PayPal Seller Reputation number, which I explain in the following section.
Your PayPal Seller Reputation number
Did you ever wonder what that number next to your name on PayPal meant
and who sees it? It’s the PayPal Reputation number, and it shows how
many Verified PayPal members have paid you. Your number increases 30
days after a transaction is complete; the delay ensures that the number
reflects only successful transactions.

That’s a pretty cool deal — don’t you think? Who
would have figured you’d get help for your outside
Web site from an eBay company?
But, as with any really cool deal, there are a few
requirements you must meet before you can set up
your shop at PayPal.

Verified Premier or Business Account: You must
maintain one of the higher-level PayPal accounts.

Registered credit card: You must maintain a 
current credit card registered to your PayPal
account.

Clicking the number will bring up a box reflecting
the number of successful transactions and informa-
tion about the seller, as shown in Figure 32-3.
PayPal Shopping invitations
As a PayPal shops owner, you have an additional
benefit. Whenever a customer sends you a payment
from an area other than your Web site (hmmmm, like
your sales on eBay, for example?), PayPal sends
them an invitation to shop at your store! A sample of
that invitation is shown in Figure 32-4.

Joining PayPal Shops


Confirmed checking account: You must have at
least one confirmed checking account tied into
your PayPal account.

Money Market Fund: You are required to sign up
for the PayPal Money Market Fund. This means
you must supply PayPal with your Social Security
number or your business’s Federal ID number.
PayPal does not send out Federal 1099 forms
on your PayPal sales. That income is coming
from your buyers, and because you’re not paid
by PayPal, they won’t issue a 1099 for your
PayPal sales.
PayPal Money Fund
For the initiated, PayPal offers its members an interest-paying
Money Fund that is partnered with Barclay Global Investors.
By being a part of this fund, you can earn interest on money
that you leave in your PayPal account. The money you earn
from sales is best transferred ASAP to your own business
account at your bank, so many sellers don’t leave any
money in his or her PayPal account. The membership in the
money fund is strictly for PayPal’s sake. So they have one
more way to verify that you’re really you (they have your
Social Security number) — or that your business is really real.
PayPal offers you FDIC pass-through insur-
ance. PayPal deposits your money as part of
pooled accounts in several banks: Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., Comerica Bank – California, USA,
and Bank of America, N.A. In the very unlikely
event that any of these major banks should
fail, your money would be covered under the
FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, along
with any other deposits you have at that bank,
up to $100,000. FDIC pass-through deposit
insurance protects you only against the failure
of the bank at which PayPal places your funds,
and does not protect you against PayPal’s very
unlikely insolvency.
After you’re committed to the idea that you’d like a
PayPal store (and assuming that you’re qualified), the
application process is easy. Just follow these steps:
1.
Give your PayPal Shop a name.
The name doesn’t really have to match your
Web site. Make it a smart marketing name —
something that will catch people’s eye as they
browse the stores.
2.
Give PayPal the URL that you want to link your
PayPal shop to.
This can be your eBay Store or your own 
e-commerce, PayPal-enabled Web site.
3.
Type a short description of your Web site.
Be as descriptive as possible and make it 
interesting!
4.
Select two categories that best describe your
store from the PayPal Shop category list.
5.
List up to 10 keywords to describe your store to
search engines.
Be smart! Learn which are your best keywords
with the ViewTracker tool explained in
Technique 14.
Featured Shop consideration
After you set up your PayPal Shop, you can apply to
be selected as featured — with your logo — on the
PayPal logoff page (you know, the page that opens
when you sign off of PayPal).
To apply, you must include another brief Web site
description, along with all the reasons you’d make a
great selection as the Featured Shop. PayPal then
selects their shops from the applications according
to the quality of each site and how well PayPal is
integrated into it. Not a bad deal!
Before you apply for Featured Shop status,
review your site’s design and usability. Selection
is based on the quality of the site and just how
prominently PayPal is integrated into it.
Just think: If just a few of the 40 million PayPal
members click onto your Web site when exiting their
transactions, you could be rolling in orders! In

Get a virtual MasterCard: You can spend it 
anywhere on the Web that accepts MasterCard
payments.
To get a virtual credit card, log onto your PayPal
account, and go to PayPal Shops. The link is at the
very bottom of the page, as shown in Figure 32-6.
• Figure 32-6: The very handy Shops link at the bottom of
every PayPal page.
After you get to PayPal Shops, look on the right side
of the page. There will be a shaded blue vertical box
with links to PayPal features. Find the link that reads
Shop Anywhere and click it.
You’ll now arrive at the Shop Anywhere page. From
this page you can select a store from the drop-down
menu as in Figure 32-7, or you can type in the URL of
any store on the Internet that accepts MasterCard
payments for their goods.
After you make your selection, a window opens for
the selected store, and in a small window at the bot-
tom, you will have your PayPal Debit bar with a vir-
tual credit card number. (See Figure 32-8.) Your Debit
bar will have the total amount of your PayPal bal-
ance as the credit limit. You can spend only to a limit
of $150.00 a day through this method.
Now all that’s left is to select an item and, when you
check out, indicate that you’re paying with Master-
Card. Type your virtual account number in the credit
card number and your PayPal account will be debited
for the amount of your purchase.
If you change your mind and choose not to
spend money with your Debit bar, don’t worry.
The money will not be debited from your
PayPal account unless you actually spend it.
Figure 32-5, check out the amount of hits one fea-
tured store got from that link on PayPal alone.
Site statistics
Every month, PayPal sends statistics on hits to PayPal
shopkeepers. Don’t worry; these statistics aren’t a
bunch of useless information — they’re all about your
Web site hits! Take a look at a sample in Figure 32-5.
Remember that this report counts only those hits that
come through links from the PayPal Shops area, not
any independent hits you get from the Internet.
• Figure 32-5: Monthly PayPal hit statistics.
Spending Your PayPal Balance
with a Virtual MasterCard
Gee, now they’ve gone and done it. As if I didn’t get
into enough trouble with my plastic already, now
they’ve invented a virtual credit card. This virtual
credit card is one that you can’t hold or touch. You’re
supplied with a temporary MasterCard number that
allows you to spend your PayPal balance (your credit
limit) at non-PayPal retail sites on the Internet.
Most likely, you don’t often keep a balance in your
PayPal account (so that you can keep your books
straight). But occasionally you might just sell some-
thing of a personal nature on eBay (like that Zippo
lighter that’s been in your dresser for years) that’s
not part of your regular, official business. If the
buyer pays for it through your PayPal account, and
you don’t want to deposit that money into your busi-
ness banking account, you’ve got three options.

Withdraw the money to your personal checking
account: The transaction will show up in your
monthly PayPal download so that you can isolate
that as separate income from your business.

Cashing In on the PayPal
Referral Program
And you thought the days of getting money for refer-
ring people to PayPal were over? Hah! It’s just that
now PayPal has set its sights a little higher. Now they
want business account referrals rather than per-
sonal users.
You can send invitations to use PayPal in your
e-mails via a custom link, or you can place a banner
on your Web site. You receive $10 the first time a
merchant you refer uses any of PayPal’s Web site
tools, and you can earn more after your referral
receives a total of $1,000 in Send Money payments.
It’s kind of like multilevel marketing. After the refer-
ral posts the initial $1000 in sales, you receive a per-
centage of your referral’s revenue, up to a maximum
of $100, for the first six months of his or her PayPal
account. The residual payout equals .5 percent of
the merchant’s net sales.
No spamming!!!
To get in on this good deal, go to the little navigation
bar at the bottom of the page, and click Referrals.
After you arrive at the target page, you’re presented
with two ways to link, as shown in Figure 32-9. One 
is a referral link for e-mail, and the other is a big honk-
ing PayPal banner that you can put on your Web site.
(HTML custom coding is already generated for you —
just copy and paste it onto your Web page.)

Using PayPal’s
Little-Known Tools
P
ayPal is constantly adding new, convenient tools to make using the
service even easier. Many of the newest tools are for those with their
own Web sites, as discussed in Technique 28. PayPal provides so
many cool tools that you’d think the company had nothing else to do but
come up with these — but, then again, I guess that’s its job. And it’s my
job to keep up with all the newest gizmos and tell you about them.
To find PayPal tools, check out the Merchant Tools section of the
PayPal site when you’re next depositing your auction receipts into your
bank account. Simply sign on to the site, transact all your business, and
then click the Merchant Tools button on the PayPal tab, as pictured in
Figure 33-1.

Other PayPal Tools, as pictured in Figure 33-2.
• Figure 33-2: The mysterious “Other” PayPal Tools.
PayPal has several “secret” tools listed in this area —
but be sure to check back regularly; they’re always
adding new ones. Here’s what you’ll find:

Instant Payment Notification: Here is a super
deal for those who have sophisticated Web sites.
This is PayPal’s interface for handling real-time
purchase confirmation and server-to-server com-
munications. It delivers immediate notification
and confirmation of PayPal payments that you
receive through your Web site, and more. This
tool is so not for the amateur!

Multiple Currencies: This link goes to a page that
thoroughly explains PayPal’s current policies on
international trade and dealing in foreign curren-
cies. If you are doing business in foreign countries
and want to accept international currencies, be
sure to visit this area.

Auction Tools: Clicking here is another way to get
to the Auction Tools area, pictured in Figure 33-3.
It seems PayPal acknowledges that their “mer-
chants” are more than likely also sellers on eBay.
(Ya think?) In the Auctions Tool hub, you’ll find
links to all the information you’d ever care to
know about some related matters:
 Add PayPal to Your Listing: This link goes
to your PayPal preference settings for your
auction accounts. Here you may select to
insert PayPal logos manually or automatically
in your eBay sales pages.
To change your auction account preferences
click the Automatic Logos link; you’ll see a
page like the one in Figure 33-4.

you go to PayPal to check your sales and deposits
anyway, why not use its tools to manage your eBay
sales? Best of all, Post-Sale Manager is free.

Shipping Made Simple

Selecting the Best
Packing Materials 
B
ecause saving time and money is what this book is all about, you
should know that the most important area where sellers drop
the time-and-money ball is in shipping. I buy hundreds of items
from eBay and have seen it all when it comes to packing, padding, and
shipping. 
I’ve received triple-packed unbreakable plastic items, swathed in yards
of plain newsprint sheets. I’ve seen money thrown out the window by 
e-tailers who have used incorrect packing materials, which are expensive
for the seller and often increase the shipping cost of the package for the
buyer due to the final weight. 
The packing materials that you use for your shipments can either
make or break your bottom line in the shipping income/expense col-
umn of your business reports. (Read more about tracking expendi-
tures in Technique 48.)
Many sellers remark, “The buyer pays shipping, so what do I care what it
costs? I pass on all those expenses to my buyers.” Well, yes and no.
Prudent packing can be a boon to your business because, in the constant
competition with other sellers on the site, having lower shipping costs
can often make the difference between a sale and a no sale. This is espe-
cially true when several people have the same item up for sale, with a
minuscule difference in the item’s selling price. Reasonable shipping
charges can make the difference. 
Pay attention to packing. It’s only expensive if you don’t know what
you’re doing. You can ship your items in quality packing, keep buyers
happy, and still make a dollar or so on each item for your handling fees.
Buying your shipping materials on eBay is trés economical. eBay ship-
ping supply e-tailers make their livings selling online. Their overhead is
much lower than any retail outlet. Even after paying shipping to get the
bubblewrap to your door, you save money and time. Most of these sellers
ship the same day they get your order. It’s wise to compare, know where
you can save money, and recognize where saving money isn’t prudent.

around, and filling collectible milk bottles so they
look full when you sell them on eBay.
Peanuts seem to multiply in dark areas. I know,
because in all my time on eBay, I’ve never had to
buy any. That’s probably because I buy almost
everything online, and everything comes in peanut
stuffing — so I never run out. (By the way, bags of
peanuts make great bumpers in the garage.)
For functionality, foam packing peanuts are the
granddaddy of all void filler. When properly placed
in a box, they fill every nook and cranny and cushion
your shipment to make it virtually indestructible.
The key is to not go short in the land of plenty — use
Use only as much packing material as neces-
sary to get the item where it’s going intact.
This saves time, money, and space.
Using Void Fill
Nope! Void fill is not a new drug to prevent hunger
pangs when dieting. Void fill is the industry term for
the stuff you use to fill up space in shipping boxes
to keep items from rolling in transit. (It’s really the
modern-day term for the old-fashioned word
dunnage.)
There are many forms of void fill, and the best kind
really depends on the item that you’re shipping.
Here are the most popular types and a description
of their plusses and minuses.
Air packing pillows
I first found out about these nifty little pillows when
I received books from a major online bookseller.
(See Figure 34-1.) When I looked into purchasing
the pillows, I was disappointed to find out that they
are made on-site in the shipping department by a
rather expensive machine that injects air into pre-
manufactured continuous tubing and then produces
pillows of the desired size. Sadly, my shipping depart-
ment (a table in the garage) was not big enough for
this machine, and my shipping budget couldn’t
absorb the price of the equipment.
After you have the machine installed (and paid for),
producing these pillows is very cost effective. But if
you don’t want to make that investment, you’ll be
glad to hear that buying them from sellers on eBay
is quite economical, mainly because the manufactur-
ing and shipping costs are low. What these folks
are essentially shipping you is 99 percent air (some-
thing the Post Office hasn’t yet figured out how to
charge for).
Air packing pillows are perfect for filling in the area
around smaller boxed items that you want to double
box. They are also handy if you have breakables that

plenty of peanuts and make sure there are no vacant
air spaces in your box. An extra bonus: They’re
cheap and if you recycle them, they don’t hurt the
environment.
Figure 34-2 below shows you how eBay sellers ship
packing peanuts in very big bags!
• Figure 34-2: Gary (eBay seller) Gatorpack waits for his
mail pick up.
Bubble wrapping by the roll
Bubble wrap (or air cellular packaging material) is de
rigueur shipping material. Bubble wrap is made up
of air-filled cushions of polyethylene. It’s supplied in
rolls of different widths and lengths (see Figure 34-3).
It really shines for those who wrap very delicate,
breakable items.
When wrapping items with bubble wrap, wrap it one
way and then the other, then affix some packing tape
to make your item an impenetrable ball. Bubble
wrap is reasonably priced and adds next to no
weight to your packages. 
When you purchase bubble wrap, be sure you
buy the perforated, or tear off kind. Cutting a
giant roll of bubble wrap with a box cutter can
be a dangerous proposition. 
• Figure 34-3: Different sizes of bubble wrap from eBay
seller, GraMur Supply.
Plain old white newsprint
In the right shipping situation, plain white newsprint
is fantastic. It’s cheap and easy to store. The bad
news? It’s heavy and sellers often use too many
sheets to wrap the items they pack.
eBay sellers dealing in glass, china, and breakable
knick-knacks often use newsprint to wrap each piece
before placing it in a box full of packing peanuts. 
If you really feel you must use newsprint, I suggest
you buy it by the roll and use a table mounted roll
cutter to cut the exact size you need. (This is the
kind of thing you may have seen in old-style butcher
shops and delis.) This set up helps you to avoid
using too much paper.
Mailing Envelopes
Many eBay sellers miss the boat completely when
they ship all their items in boxes, just because
they’re free from the Post Office (Technique 36
shows you how to get free boxes and envelopes
as well). When you get into serious selling, using

Mailing envelopes come made of many types of
materials. Some are sturdier than others. Here’s
what many eBay sellers use:

Poly Vinyl Envelopes: If you’ve ever ordered
clothing or bedding from any of the television-
shopping clubs, this is what they came in. Poly
Vinyl envelopes are lightweight, puncture and
tear resistant, and light as a feather. They are the
most durable envelopes available. Who says you
have to ship in boxes?

Tyvek Envelopes: You know those really cool
indestructible white envelopes you get from the
Post Office or FedEx? They’re made of DuPont
Tyvek. It isn’t made of paper, it’s spun-bonded
olefin fiber. It’s got all the benefits of vinyl
envelopes and more. Tyvek breathes (allows air
to reach your product) and has a higher
strength-to-weight ratio than other envelope
materials. (That ratio business means it’s very
strong, yet feather light.)

Bubble Padded Mailers: These are the type of
envelope most-used by eBay sellers. The
envelopes are lined with small bubbles, very sim-
ilar to bubble wrap. They’re great for shipping a
variety of items. Bubble lined mailers come in dif-
ferent materials; the pros and cons of each are
 Plain paper bubble mailers are the cheapest
possible way to go, but can be damaged in the
mail if you ship heavy items in them. The
envelopes will cut your shipping costs and your
items will still arrive safe and sound.
Items sent in envelopes can be sent via First
Class mail as long as they weigh 13 ounces
or less.
Thankfully, the envelope makers of the world have
united to manufacture their envelopes in standard
sizes. Figure 34-4 gives you an idea what these
look like.
• Figure 34-4: A variety of bubble envelopes in standard
sizes from eBay seller, grasup.
Not only are there different sizes, but someone actu-
ally gave some thought to making these envelopes
so that they fit certain items. Take a look at Table
34-1 for a listing of standard envelope sizes and their
uses.

perfect way to get around that is to wrap
some cheap clear packing tape once around
the envelope in each direction.
 Vinyl bubble mailers aren’t very expensive
and are a super protective way to ship.
They’re 15% lighter than paper bubble mailers
and are water resistant. 
Getting It Boxed
Boxes come in thousands of sizes. 
Buying in bulk
If you’ve been buying shipping boxes from brick-and-
mortar office supply stores, you’re paying a lot for
the convenience. Yes, they do deliver — but so do
the companies who do nothing but manufacture
boxes. And these guys offer terrific discounts if you
buy 100 at a time.
Check your local phone book and look up Boxes,
Manufacturers. If you’re a legitimate business, they
will be happy to sell to you if you buy in quantity. 
Buying boxes on eBay
If you want smaller quantities of boxes, say 25 at a
time, look for eBay sellers offering various sizes of
boxes on the site. Just use your search tricks and
search shipping (box,boxes). (eBay search-engine
tricks are in Technique 1.)
Free Priority Mail boxes
Yes, you savvy sellers out there, I know that many of
you already know you can get free boxes from the
Post Office to ship your Priority Mail packages. But
every day I meet more sellers who don’t know. So
here’s the deal . . .
The U.S. Postal Service will ship free boxes, packing
tape, labels, and shipping forms for Express Mail,
Priority Mail, and Global Priority Mail to your home
or business. In the U.S., you can order by phone
(800-222-1811) or online (supplies.usps.gov). Find
out more about this in Technique 36.
What happens when you put a new item up
for sale and someone buys it immediately,
but you have no box to ship it in? If the item
comes in a sturdy, shippable box, you’re some-
what safe. However the Post Office won’t
always accept boxes that are overprinted with
manufacturer’s pictures and promotional info.
Get some tan color shipping tape, and cover
most of the box. It will make the package look
somewhat like a plain brown box. You can
label it and off it goes.
If the item didn’t come in its own box, you can
always do some box begging at your local
shopping center for a box of appropriate size
(just be sure you get it before it hits the
dumpster — the package smells better that way).

Picking the Right
Shipper
O
ne decision about your eBay business that seems easy is selecting
the right shipper — but actually it’s one of the more difficult
choices, at least if you care about your buyers. Shipping can make
or break your customer service. Whoever delivers the package to the
buyer is a virtual extension of your company.
Professional labels, clean boxes, nifty packing peanuts — those are the
things you control. But safe and timely delivery falls into the hands of
complete strangers. Once the package leaves your door, it’s no longer
under your control — yet somehow the buyer blames you for the tardi-
ness or sloppiness of the shipping. Your bottom line isn’t the shipper’s
concern, and no matter how many refunds you get for missed delivery
schedules, it won’t help when you have one irate customer after another.
Simple equation: Irate customers = lousy eBay feedback.
So, what’s a seller to do? Do you use the shipper that other sellers rave
about? Perhaps opt for convenience over low price? After you decide on
a shipper, how often do you re-evaluate its services? 
Did you know that the big two — United Parcel Service and Federal
Express — raise their rates every year? The United States Postal
Service raises its rates too, but the difference is that the media makes
a lot more noise (it’s in the newspapers and on the TV news) every
time a postage stamp goes up by 1 cent. (Hey, that’s traditional!)
It’s easy to go on the Internet, or talk to friends and hear horror stories
about any of the main shippers. The bottom line is, which one works best
for you?
Meeting the Front Line
Who constitutes your eBay business front line? My shipping front line is
Scott, the UPS man; Tim the Post Office carrier, and Jorge who picks up
for FedEx Ground. I know the front-line guys because they make my eBay

Location, Location, Location

business run smoothly. They don’t leave deliveries
outside under a bush, and always deliver packages
to my neighbor if I’m not home. They pick up my
sundry packages with a smile and a lighthearted
“They’re sure buying things on eBay, aren’t they?” I
respond with a smile and a bit of friendly chitchat.
Wait, are you telling me that you don’t get the same
service? Have you ever taken a moment to chat with
your delivery person? When you personalize a busi-
ness relationship, you become more than a street
address, you become . . .well . . . a person. When
you’re no longer a number, you become a fellow
human being with needs and wants. Believe it or not,
people want to make other people happy, even when
they feel grumpy. (I’ll bet your eBay activities leave
you grumpy sometimes too!)
Your front line can help you by watching out for your
packages. They can be sure that your packages go
into the bin that leaves immediately, versus the one
that sits till the end of the day.
I leave a signal when there are packages to be picked
up, and every one is picked up. When my thoughtful
delivery person delivers a big box, he brings it to the
back door near my studio so I don’t have to drag it
through the front door and across the house.
Of course, your front line can go on vacation — or
(heaven forbid) have a sick day. On one day, I was the
victim of what I refer to as a “dump and run” from a
substitute driver (see Figure 35-1). He dumped stacks
of large boxes on my front doorstep — practically
blocking access to the door — and didn’t even ring
the bell!
Try building a relationship with your shipping front
line. I’ve invited them to company holiday parties,
and offered them a cool drink on a hot summer day.
The result? My shipping is the easiest part of my
business.
You can imagine what happens when you have a good
front line — and I’ve got one. On a day when I had a
lot coming in, they had to call in the reserves — and I
got two trucks for the price of one!
• Figure 35-1: He dumped, ran, and didn’t even ring the
bell.
Location, Location, Location
What happens if you have to drop off your packages
for shipment? It’s important to consider where the
closest local drop-off point for your carrier is. 
Each of the major carriers has a search feature on its
Web site to find the nearest drop-off location. You
input your address or ZIP code, and the feature tells
you the locations closest to you.
To get the nearest location lowdown quickly, go to
the following sites:

FedEx: www.fedex.com/us/dropoff/?link=1

USPS: www.mapsonus.com/db/USPS/

UPS: www.ups.com/dropoff?loc=en_US
Remember that when you go to a drop-off location, it
is invariably at the height of rush hour traffic. Take
this into consideration and plan your time accord-
ingly. From where I live, a half mile drive can take
anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes — depending on the
route I take and the amount of traffic at the time.

Technique 35: Picking the Right Shipper
218
Take a look at Table 35-1 — compare the pricing for
certain types of packages. Know that there are
extras to consider for some services, so become
familiar with the variations and hidden costs.

is when you realize that the USPS charges a
fractional amount more for 2-to-3-day Priority
Mail.

major shipping carriers. Stay tuned for tales of the

Be sure to read the details about each location
online. There may be different fees involved in
dropping off packages. Some locations may
accept certain types of packages and not others.
Read the fine print.
Take a look at the FedEx locator result in Figure 35-2.
It lists times for final drop-off, types of packages
accepted, and which days they’re open. The devil is
in the details!

Compare the Costs
The general consensus is that a particular method of
shipping is cheaper for large items and another is
cheaper for small packages. Each method has its own
personal peculiarities.

Shipping with the
U.S. Postal Service
I
’m a big fan of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Just ask my wonderful
letter (or multiple-parcel) carrier, Tim. I use the Post Office for the bulk
of my eBay sales because it’s convenient. In my eight years selling
items on eBay, they’ve never lost a package. 
The Post Office has worked hard to keep up with the competition in the
parcel business by offering many online features and custom pickup.
USPS also offers many classes of service that top out with a maximum
weight of 70 pounds. Table 36-1 shows services that are most popular
with eBay sellers.

If you aren’t shipping a great many items each week,

can generate a custom bar code mailing label with
an e/Delivery Confirmation number for Priority Mail
packages (see Figure 36-1). You can print these
labels directly from your inkjet or laser printer, and
then simply tape the label to your package.
• Figure 36-1: Sample of a free Delivery Confirmation
Label generated from the Post Office 
Web site.
Before taking any of the transit times I’ve mentioned
(say from Los Angeles to New York) to heart, be
sure to get a calculation from the Post Office Web
site (which you’ll find at postcalc.usps.gov). When
you calculate postage, the Post Office will indicate
expected transit times for your packages.
Understanding the Costs
The Postal Service levies additional charges for
some often-used services, including:

Pickup: If you have a postal license through an
online service (see the section “Print Your Own
Postage and Get Free Confirmations,” later in this
technique), the Post Office offers free pickup.
You have to give your packages to your carrier
at the time of your regular delivery, or schedule
a pickup on the USPS site. 

Insurance: This guarantees that you’re covered
if your package doesn’t arrive safely and will
reimburse you up to the value you declare when
purchasing the insurance. There is a maximum of
$5,000. If your package gets lost or severely man-
gled in shipping, the Postal Service will, after a
thorough investigation (see Technique 40), pay
your claim. Fees start at $1.30 for packages up to
$50, and $2.20 for packages up to $100. You can
then add $1 for each $100 of insured value. For
discounted insurance, read on. 
The Post Office will not compensate you for
more than the value of an item. If you have to
make a claim, be sure that you have invoices
to back up the insured amount.

Delivery Confirmation: Delivery Confirmation
provides you with proof of delivery or attempted
delivery. You can purchase Delivery Confirmations
for $.45 or $.55 (for Priority Mail and Parcel Post,
respectively) at the Post Office when you mail
a package. You get a tracking number that you
can check online at www.usps.com/shipping/
trackandconfirm.htm. You can also verify a
package’s delivery by calling a toll-free number,
800-222-1811.

Print Your Own Postage and Get Free Confirmations
221
If you’re in business and need to keep records of
your shipping (dates, weights, and confirmation
numbers), this method may be the way to go. The
Post Office site, although free, prints out a label only
once. If you want keep records, you’ll have to enter
the information separately into a spreadsheet or a
text file.
You can also get a free Delivery Confirmation
(one at a time, without any detailed record) at
www.shippertools.com/standard/label
addresses.php.
And you can get free Delivery Confirmation for Priority
Mail packages if you subscribe to an online shipping
service, as described in the next section. 
Online Delivery Confirmation
Services
If you want to ramp up your business a bit and you
have more packages than you’d like to take to the
fine folks who live behind the counter, why not try a
service such as shippertools.com.
shippertools.com is an online delivery confirmation
service that’s hooked directly into the Post Office
API (Application Program Interface, read: the Post
Office’s computer). For a flat $6.95 a month, you can
use as many Delivery Confirmation mailing labels as
you wish. If you ship more than 16 Priority Mail
packages a month, you’ll break even. More than that,
and you’re in the money!
It has been proven by top eBay sellers that the
use of Delivery Confirmation numbers cuts
buyer fraud dramatically.
The site also has a useful and easy-to-use interface
that allows you to pre-design e-mails to send to your
customers directly from their site. You can also get
downloadable and printable records of your mailings
with one click tracking. See Figure 36-2 to find out
what all these features look like.
• Figure 36-2: The shippertools.com Delivery Confirmation
service.
When using most online services for printing
postage or DCs, you get free Priority Mail
Confirmations. But, you can also get Delivery
Confirmations for First Class, Parcel Post, and
Media Mail for an additional 13 cents of
postage (a big savings!). 
Print Your Own Postage and Get
Free Confirmations
I’ve been printing my postage directly from my com-
puter since the early days of online postage, with the
now defunct e-stamp. I like printing my own postage
because it’s convenient: I never have to go to the
Post Office.
There are currently two preeminent vendors of
online postage; stamps.com and endicia.com. My
favorite is endicia.com, which offers a full online
postage service for the eBay seller. Using endicia
allows you to use state-of-the-art mailing software
(see Figure 36-3) that includes capabilities for cus-
tom label design. They offer templates for over
30 label sizes and envelopes. You can even design
your mailing label to print on a regular piece of
paper.

Technique 36: Shipping with the U.S. Postal Service
222
Certain levels of electronic postage are permitted by the U.S.
Postal Service to print postage labels without the postage
amount. It’s a very handy feature that allows you the privacy
of adding handling charges without freaking out the recipient.
When you register as a member of endicia.com, you
are also signing up for a USPS postal license, which
permits you to print your own postage for all classes
of mail. It also permits you to print the free Delivery
Confirmations and pay the 13-cent discounted rate
for Parcel Post, Media Mail, and First Class confir-
mations. This is charged to your postage account
directly.
For a 60-day free trial of their service, go
to www.endicia.com/coolebaytools.
Your credit card information is safely stored with
endicia, and whenever you run out of postage, you
can just make a purchase using a drop-down menu.
Mechanizing Your Shipping
Okay, I’m not talking about moving giant mailing
machines into your home office; I’m just talking
about using a label printer. There are several quality
brands of label printers on the market. Two of the
most popular sold on eBay are the Zebra 2844 and
the Dymo LabelWriter 330.
If you’re interested in investing in one, be sure
to look for one of these label printers on eBay.
You can often get them at a hefty discount off
of retail price.
When using an online postage service, you simply
cut and paste the address of your buyer from the
PayPal payment confirmation e-mail into the postage
software. When the address is in the program, you
can print the postage and Delivery Confirmation
directly to a label that you peel off and place directly
on the package. No taping, no muss, or fuss.
• Figure 36-3: Using the downloaded DAZzle design
software to customize a mailing label.
endicia offers two levels of service, and the fees are
reasonable. The basic membership is $9.95 a month
and the Premium level of service is $15.95. (If you
pay for a year in advance, you get a discount.) The
Premium service adds additional features, such as
customizable e-mail, enhanced online transaction
reports and statistics, business reply mail, return
shipping labels (prepaid so your customer won’t
have to pay for the return), and stealth indicia.
What’s a stealth indicia?
Have you ever wondered why, when you receive a package
from UPS or FedEx, you can’t see how much the service
charged for the shipping the way you can with postage
stamps? Well, that’s called  a “stealth” indicia.

Private Postal Package Insurance
223
I have received packages from several of eBay’s
largest sellers only to get handwritten mailing labels,
or my address cut out from the PayPal payment con-
firmation e-mail printed on a piece of paper. Wow,
real businesslike, huh? This is not a good way to
impress your customers with your professionalism.
The investment in a label printer saves you time and
money, and pays for itself in short order. When you
use a “mechanized” set-up, you’ll never want to print
labels on plain paper again.
U.S. Postage at a big discount!
I just had to share this with you! Look at the figure in this
sidebar. It’s a picture of an envelope that I recently received
on an eBay purchase. I had to e-mail the seller to find out
how and why she used so many stamps.
It seems that the seller is a collector of U.S. postage. She
checks out eBay auctions and buys deals on old sheets of
mint-state stamps. United States stamps, no matter how
old, are always good, so she buys these stamps at discount
and uses them on her eBay packages. 
Of course, she also says that when she brings her packages
to the Post Office, all the clerks scatter to take a break!
Getting Free Package Pickup
from the Post Office
Because most package services charge for pickup,
the Post Office decided to one-up them. If you have a
postal license and print your own postage from an
online service, the Post Office will pick up your pack-
ages free. If you’re afraid that you’ll miss your regu-
lar carrier — visit http://carrierpickup.usps.com/
cgi-bin/WebObjects/CarrierPickup.woa to arrange
for your packages to be picked up (see Figure 36-4).

round the turn of the previous century (in 1907 to be exact), an
enterprising 19-year-old figured he could make some money deliv-
ering pizzas for the local Italian restaurant. Just kidding about the 
pizzas. Actually James (Jim) Casey borrowed $100 from a friend to buy
some used bicycles and began the American Messenger Company to run
errands, send messages (no fax machines or IM!), deliver packages, and
(you guessed it) carry trays of food from local restaurants to off-site
patrons in Seattle, Washington. And from American Messenger’s 6-foot-by-
17-foot headquarters in a basement beneath his uncle’s tavern, Jim helped
The Little Parcel Service That Could grow into the Jolly Brown Giant we
know as UPS.
You can see the sidebar “UPS Evolution” later in this technique for more
UPS history, but what you really need to know is how UPS — with its
strict policies of customer courtesy, reliability, round-the-clock service,
and low rates — can help you deliver the goods for your eBay business.
Many eBay sellers just love using UPS. They think of it as the ultimate
way to ship their packages. But as I note in Technique 35, the right ship-
per for one seller may not be the best for another. For example, since the
USPS has converted to the cost by mileage/weight formula, you may find
(based on your location and the buyer’s location) that the U.S. Postal
Service may be more economical.
So while you make your shipping decisions, use the handy tables and
other information in this technique to make the most of the services that
UPS offers.
Using UPS Today
Today’s UPS is a $30 billion company focusing on enabling commerce
around the world. Every day UPS delivers over 13.3 million packages and
documents — I’m sure much of which represents eBay transactions.
UPS (along with the USPS) has hooked up with eBay, and you can access
their information through the eBay site. To visit the eBay/UPS Shipping
Center, visit pages.eBay.com/ups/home.html (as pictured in Figure 37-1).

Timing your shipments
If you’re thinking about using UPS, you’d do yourself
a favor by becoming familiar with the company’s dif-
ferent classes of service — and what those classes
mean to your customers in shipping days — as listed
in Table 37-1.

UPS Evolution
Realize that it wasn’t until 1913 that the United States Postal
Service began its Parcel Post deliveries — so this left quite
an opening for the young entrepreneurs of the day. There
were few automobiles, and department stores used horses
and carriages for their deliveries. A bicycle service would be
a fast and economical alternative.
This environment set the stage for Jim Casey, his partner
Claude Ryan, and a handful of other teenagers to beat out
the delivery service competition. They instituted strict poli-
cies of customer courtesy, reliability, round-the-clock serv-
ice, and low rates. They even slept in the office so that they
could deliver service 24/7.
In 1915, they changed their company name from American
Messenger Company to Merchants Parcel Delivery. The lit-
tle company grew, and Jim Casey retired as CEO of United
Parcel Service in 1962. The now not-so-little parcel service
had revenues approaching $14 million. Casey served on
the UPS Board of Directors until a month before his death
at age 95 in 1983.
Wow. Maybe in 50 years we’ll have a story like that about
an eBay entrepreneur who worked hard at building an
eBay business and became a national institution. Quite a
tribute to hard work.

Checking Out UPS Rates
227
UPS considers neither Saturday nor Sunday to be
delivery days. So when your package is quoted for a
5-day delivery, and the 5 days cross over a weekend,
add two days to the delivery schedule. (The USPS
and FedEx Ground deliver on Saturday.)
Comparing the costs
Although we always complain when the USPS raises
its rates, you should know that all other shipping
carriers religiously raise their rates every year.
Annual rate increases are why being lulled
into complacency can be a dangerous thing;
be sure to evaluate your shipping charges
(and your shipper’s fees) every year to keep
up with the increases and possible cuts into
your bottom line.
Remember also, that UPS charges a different rate for
home delivery than they do for deliveries to a busi-
ness. Eighty percent of UPS business is commercial,
and the home delivery business takes a whole lot
more man-hours to deliver fewer packages. In their
last rate increase, residential delivery took the
biggest hit. The premium for home delivery rose 22
percent; the previous year it rose 4.5 percent. That’s
an increase from $1.10 to $1.40 in just two years.
While we all think that UPS ground is cheaper than
the Post Office, it’s not true in every case. Take a
look at the cross-country rates in Table 37-2. 
Every UPS package is automatically insured
for up to $100 (assuming you declare a value).
The Post Office charges extra for the service,
but you can save money either way by using a
private insurance policy for your packages (see
Technique 39).
The de-facto standard for eBay shipping is Priority
Mail, which I’ve compared to UPS 3 Day Select. If you
ship packages for swift delivery, the clear cost sav-
ing winner is Priority Mail.
For heavier packages (those over 6 pounds), UPS is
considerably cheaper than Parcel Post. So if you
continually ship items over 5 pounds, and time is not
of the essence, UPS may be the best way to go.

Checking Out UPS Rates
UPS has several different rate levels depending on
the type of account you have with them. 
The UPS charges charged through PayPal are
based on “occasional” shippers (the “on
demand” rate) shipping to home addresses. If
you’re shipping a lot of merchandise via UPS,
you could have your packages picked up, and
it might cost you less in the long run.
When you ship via UPS and wonder how to get the
best rates, you’ve got quite a conundrum. UPS basi-
cally charges small-time shippers three different rates:

out your labels directly from the UPS Web site and
have a preprinted manifest ready for the driver.
You do have to pay for that pickup service, but let’s
do the math. Here are the actual costs of UPS pickup
service. The fees are on a sliding scale from $7 to
$16, based on the amount of “postage” that you use
in a week.
POSTAGE PER WEEK
UPS CHARGES FOR PICKUP
$0 to $14.99
$16
$15.00 to $59.99
$11
$60.00 and more
$7
Shipping seven ten-pound packages or eight five-
pound packages coast-to-coast would easily meet
the $60 in postage per week minimum. If you’re sell-
ing heavier items on eBay, UPS service with package
pickup wins over the Post Office, hands down!
You could easily charge customers the familiar
UPS eBay/PayPal rate (and use the shipping
calculator in your item listings) plus a small
handling fee and be strengthening your bot-
tom line on every shipment!

Retail Rate: This is the rate you pay when you go
to the UPS Customer Center and they create the
label for you. It’s the most expensive, and with
the eBay/PayPal solution, you can save yourself
some bucks by printing your own label and drop-
ping the packages at the Customer Center.

On Demand: The charges you see on eBay/PayPal
shipping are these rates. They are really made for
the occasional shipper.

Daily Rate: When you have arranged a daily
pickup through UPS. This is when you get to
make friends with the folks in brown shorts, and
as an added benefit, you pay the lowest possible
rates. (See Table 37-3 for a comparison.)
Saving Big Money with
Package Pickup
If you’re anything like me, you are suffering from the
delusion that it costs a bundle to have regular UPS
package pickup service. Surprise! It doesn’t.
If you look at Table 37-3, you can see that if you have
daily pickup, you’d net a savings of close to $2 per
package by using the daily rate. You could also print

U
nlike the warm and fuzzy story of the beginnings of UPS (see
Technique 37), where a teenager borrowed $100 to start a business,
Federal Express was the brainchild of a rich kid. (Somewhat remi-
niscent of touching apocryphal stories you hear about a few top-ranked
eBay sellers from moneyed backgrounds, who had lots of cash and con-
nections before they ever came to eBay and met with immediate success.)
Yep, in 1965 — while an undergraduate at prestigious Yale University —
Frederick Smith wrote a term paper about current air carriers’ freight-
forwarding side-business. Smith thought this a very uneconomical way
to ship freight, and proposed that a freight-only carrier would do a better
job for less money. Fast-forward to 1971. After serving in the military,
Smith bought controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation Sales. He felt the
need for even faster delivery than in days past, and worked to fill the
void in the second- and next-day delivery services. Federal Express was
born and officially launched in 1973, with 14 planes housed at the
Memphis International Airport. On the first night of operation, Federal
Express delivered 186 packages to 25 U.S. cities from Rochester, New
York, to Miami, Florida.
Although Federal Express spent its first years as an air-delivery service
(see the sidebar “The road to FedEx”), the company later expanded into a
ground business that now reaches all over the U.S. In Techniques 36 and
37, you found out about the pros and cons of shipping through (respec-
tively) the U.S. Postal Service and UPS. Here in Technique 38, I show you
the advantages and potential savings from using FedEx Ground.
The road to FedEx
In its early years of business, Federal Express struggled, but by 1976, the company
showed a profit and owned 76 aircraft, including 39 Boeing 727s and four Douglas
DC-10s. After officially being in business for only ten years, the company posted rev-
enues of $1 billion — a previously unheard of amount for such a young company. In
a deft move, Federal Express merged with the highly successful Tiger International in
1989. Tiger International was known also as the Flying Tiger Line, one of the coun-
try’s first air freight companies — founded in 1945 by a member of the World War II
original Flying Tiger squad. (Google that if you want to read a good story!)

Go to www.fedex.com/us.
2.
On the left side of the screen, click the link to
FedEx Ground.
The FedEx Ground page appears.
3.
From the FedEx Ground page, click the Ship

tried my eBay User ID and it was already
taken — I guess they have lots of customers).
 Password: Come up with a password you’ll

words, see Technique 63.
Federal Express purchased RPS (Roadway Package Systems)
in 1985 to try for a piece of the UPS stronghold on ground
delivery. Then in 1994, answering the need to get with the
times, the company changed its name to FedEx — using
their customer’s verbal abbreviation for the company. (As in,
“I’ll FedEx you the papers overnight.”)
The FedEx expansion into ground services grew to include
home delivery as well as commercial, and by 2002, the
company’s ground service delivered packages to virtually
every address in the United States.

Saving on your shipping costs
I was very impressed when I researched FedEx
Ground rates. In their early days, many sellers were
leery of using FedEx due to spotty delivery areas and
all. But now, they cover all residences in the country
and charge less to boot!
FedEx Ground will deliver on Saturdays at no
extra charge.
Check out Table 38-1. The rates quoted are at the
time of this writing from Los Angeles to New York
(the longest distance — Zone 8 — that you can
ship). It’s clear that when shipping packages over
3 pounds, you can really save by using FedEx
Ground.
Since eBay doesn’t include FedEx on their
shipping calculator, I’d say you’d be very safe
setting up the online shipping calculator so
that buyers can set their shipping costs for
UPS Ground rates.

Technique
Insuring Against
the Worst
W
hen you’re shipping a large amount of merchandise out on a reg-
ular basis, you’re going to have to deal with the question of
whether you offer your buyers insurance against damage or
loss. Bottom line: Whether you offer insurance or not, you (the seller) are
ultimately responsible for getting the product to the buyer. The lost-in-
the-mail excuse doesn’t cut the mustard, and having a delivery confirma-
tion number doesn’t guarantee anything either.
You may think that it’s the buyer’s responsibility to pay for insurance.
If they don’t, you say, it’s their hard luck if the package doesn’t arrive.
This is far from the truth; a buyer who does not receive an item that
she’s paid for can legitimately file a fraud report against you. Buyers
can also have the payment removed from your PayPal account if you
have no physical proof that you’ve shipped the item, and you have
no defense against this.
With all that said, I say this again: You’d best realize that the responsibility
for delivering the goods is in the seller’s hands. So, offering insurance to
your buyers is good business, and including insurance with every shipment
is excellent business. This technique tells you about the various ways you
can insure your packages — and stay within a reasonable budget.
Even the best insurance won’t protect you against shoddy packing
practices. If you end up with a damaged shipment because some-
body threw a couple of crystal goblets in a box with a few pieces of
paper, odds are the shipper won’t pay off on the claim. (They do
request to see the package before they pay.) Follow safe shipping
practices; see Technique 34 for more info.
Self-Insuring Your Items
Some sellers on eBay self-insure their packages. In other words, they take
the risks and use money out of their own pockets if they have to pay a
claim. These sellers are usually very careful about packing their items to

Getting Private Shipping Insurance
235
prevent damage. (Check out Technique 34 to find
out about choosing and finding packing materials.)
They also purchase delivery confirmations when
using the Postal Service.
Savvy self-insurers usually do not self-insure
items of high value. If you sell mostly lower-
priced items (under $50) and decide to self-
insure, consider making an exception when
you do occasionally sell an expensive item.
Bite the bullet and pay for the shipping insur-
ance; doing so could save you money and has-
sle in the long run.
How do you afford to self-insure? Here are a couple
of the common methods:

Tack an additional $1 onto every item’s postage
amount as part of your handling fee. The more
items you sell and ship, the more that little 
dollar-per-item profit builds up and gives you a
fund that you can use to cover the rare instance
of a damaged or missing item.

Offer optional shipping at full USPS prices as part
of the sale. Then, rather than pay the Post Office
to insure the items, keep the extra fee. Again, if
something untoward happens to one of your
packages as it gets (or doesn’t get) to its destina-
tion, you’ll have accumulated a small fund to
cover any refund to the buyer.
This second method of building your self-
insurance fund may be a risky proposition. But
if you sell a lot of items for under $50, you
might find that this works for you.
Insuring through the 
Major Carriers
All the major shippers are in the shipping business
(duh), not in the insurance business. Insuring is a
dirty, annoying — but necessary — sideline to their
package-transit business.
Most carriers, other than the United States Postal
Service, cover all shipments automatically (and at
no extra charge) for the first $100 of package value.
By the way, the package value of an item sold on
eBay is the final bid (or Buy It Now) amount. Of
course, you can always buy additional package
insurance for your shipped items. Should a package
get lost or damaged, making a claim opens an
entirely new can of worms. (Technique 40 gives you
the scoop about the procedures for filing insurance
claims with the major carriers.)
Table 39-1 shows you what the major carriers charge
for their additional insurance.

Getting Private Shipping
Insurance
Some smart person, long, long ago, came up with the
idea of privately insuring freight as it traveled over
long distances. As early as 1688, Edward Lloyd
became known in business circles as the guy who
knew all about shipping. His small coffeehouse
became the hub where ships’ captains, merchants,
and rich men went to get the facts about lost ships
and salvage cargo.

Technique 39: Insuring Against the Worst


Blanket approval: U-PIC is approved by all major
carriers. And turnabout is fair play: All carriers
covered must be on the U-PIC approved carrier
listing.

Cost savings: Again, depending on the quantity
and type of items you ship, using U-PIC may save
you between 65% and 90% on your insurance
costs. Table 39-2 shows the company’s current
rates. International coverage is available for all

A merchant wanting to insure cargo being sent out
on a ship would show up at Lloyd’s coffee shop look-
ing for a broker to get a policy. The broker would
solicit many wealthy individuals to pool their
resources so that each took just a portion of the risk.
Mr. Lloyd ran his business from the coffeehouse
until his death in 1713, and the brokers who started
with Lloyd formalized the business that is now the
famous Lloyd’s of London. The company currently
insures much more than shipments — movie stars’
body parts, singers’ voices, and just about anything
that one might wish to insure.
The point of the Lloyd’s of London story is that
your business can have a separate insurance
policy to cover your eBay shipments. Depending
on quantity and type of goods you ship, such
insurance could ultimately save you thousands
of dollars per year.
There is a company, U-PIC, that caters to individual
eBay sellers amidst its many big-business clients.
Here are some great features of the U-PIC service:

No time wasted standing in line at the Post
Office: The U-PIC service is integrated into
online shipping solutions such as endicia.com
(described in Technique 36).

Quick payments on claims: When you do have a
claim, U-PIC pays it within 7 days of receiving all
required documents from the carrier.
As with any insurance policy, assume that if
you have many claims against your packages,
you can be dropped from the service. (This
thought only gives me more impetus to pack-
age my items properly — I never want to be
banished to the counter lines again!)

Making a Claim
When Shipping
Goes Bad
I
f you’ve been selling or buying on eBay for a length of time, odds are
you’ve been involved with making a claim for lost or damaged pack-
ages. The process is often grueling — with all the paperwork that’s
involved — and the decision of the carrier is final. If you don’t agree with
the carrier, you could try small claims court. But realize that you’ll lose
around a day of work and, in court, you’ll face all the legalese you find in
the teeny-tiny print on the carrier’s Terms of Service.
I understand the hassles because I’ve had to make several claims myself.
One claim that I actually won several years ago, after much haggling, was
for (please don’t judge me here) a framed original wardrobe uniform tunic
from the Star Trek series — autographed by Leonard Nimoy. (Find the 
rest of the story in the sidebar, “A couple of claim stories,” also in this
technique.) I’d like to help you avoid similar unpleasant experiences, or at
least make them less unpleasant, and that’s why I wrote this technique.
As a shipper, you have control over how you label and ship your pack-
ages. This technique explains how to accurately label your packages and
what you should include in the package to help with identification, in
case the package does lose its way. But if you do a lot of shipping, you’ll
inevitably be faced with making a claim. In this technique, I first present
information about the U.S. Postal Service because their claim process is
more stringent than that of the other carriers. With any carrier, you need
to gather the same type of backup information before making a claim.
Mistyping Addresses Means Losing Parcels
Lost packages are the bane of all carriers since they started accepting
packages for delivery. The Post Office has been dealing this problem
since it opened the Dead Letter Office in 1825.
The Postal Service’s Dead Letter Office employees (I’ll call them DLOs)
are the only people legally permitted to open lost mail. When an address
label gets smooshed, torn, wet, or otherwise illegible enough that the

If you have the Google toolbar (which I highly
recommend in Technique 55 — also find more
Google tricks on the Cheat Sheet), or go to
www.google.com, you can type in any UPS,
Post Office, or FedEx tracking number and
find the current tracking information from the
carrier’s Web site. Just copy and paste the
tracking number into the Google search box
and start your search. You’ll come to a page
that presents a link to track packages — with
your number and carrier showing. Click the
link and you end up at the carrier’s site with all
the current tracking information! Nice!
A couple of claim stories
Several years ago, I purchased an original wardrobe uniform
tunic from the Star Trek series that was framed and auto-
graphed by Leonard Nimoy. And I was anxiously awaiting
its arrival. When it came, in an appropriately large box sur-
rounded with lots of Styrofoam peanuts and bubble wrap, it
also sported a 4” x 4” hole in the side, and it looked like
someone had taken a sword to the box! Not only that, but
there was a sad sound of glass tinkling when one shook the
box. Oh, yes, the deliveryman had dumped the box, rung
the bell, and run.
box can’t be delivered, it finds its way into the hands
of the DLOs, who open the package with the hope of
finding enough information to get it to the rightful
owner.
Make sure that you always include a packing
slip — like the kind you print from Selling
Manager or My eBay — inside your packages.
The packing slip should have both your
address and the buyer’s so that if the label is
illegible, the packing slip will identify the
owner and the package can be delivered.
Of course, having the buyer’s address correct on the
label is critical to begin with. The following ideas
and practices will help you create accurate shipping
labels:

Cut and paste the buyer’s address: The safest
way to correct addressing is to cut and paste the
buyer’s address information from an e-mail or the
PayPal payment confirmation or download. If your
buyer’s address shows as unconfirmed through
PayPal, send a quick e-mail to your buyer to verify.
People do make mistakes, even when writing their
own addresses.

Don’t depend on the carrier to correct an
address: No carrier is really going to tell you
whether the address you have is incorrect. To test
my theory, I’ve deliberately typed nonexistent
addresses into the Post Office, UPS, and FedEx
forms. The carrier’s forms didn’t correct a thing.
The only time I’ve had inaccurate addresses 
corrected is when I used the Dazzle software. 

Use software or online services to check your
buyer’s address: It’s good business practice to
confirm the viability of an address before you
send your item. Software like Dazzle (from 
endicia.com) through Dial-A-ZIP corrects most
common addressing errors such as misspelled
city or street name. If you have a question about
a ZIP code, you can check it at the Post Office
Web site www.usps.com/zip4. Notice how it 
corrected the city (and questioned the street
address) in Figure 40-1.

Making a Claim with the Post Office
239
The carrier couldn’t really argue about the damage. The
claim department tried to give me the line that the item was
packed incorrectly. (Does that mean it was sent with a big
hole already in the side of the box?) Then they offered me
a partial payment. Gee, I really wanted the glass-particle-
infested, ripped tunic now. It took a while, but the damages
were so obvious that the carrier had to give in and agreed
to send a check to the seller. Upon hearing this decision,
the seller refunded my payment. (I wonder how long the
seller had to wait for his payment?)
There was also a dress that I sold and shipped Priority Mail.
It  never arrived. I had a boiling-hot buyer on the other end,
but luckily, I had proof of mailing in the form of a Delivery
Confirmation to show her. I nagged the Post Office about
the package, but as you’ll read in the section, “Making a
Claim with the Post Office,” you have to wait 30 days for a
package to be officially declared lost. On the 29th day, the
box was returned to me with no explanation or fanfare and
just a return-to-sender stamp on the front.
Here’s something to keep in mind when you’re
thinking about filing a claim. When you pur-
chase insurance from a carrier, only the content
of the package is insured. The shipping carrier
doesn’t seem to care whether an item’s packag-
ing gets destroyed. I’ve heard that many a claim
for damaged packaging has been denied on 
collectibles where the packaging in mint condi-
tion is just as important as the item being per-
fect. If a Barbie doll was shipped, only the safe
intact arrival of the doll seems to matter, not the
special collector’s box surrounding it.
Making a Claim with 
the Post Office
Making a Claim with the Post Office: Oh man, talk
about a hassle. But making a claim with any carrier
isn’t a bowl of cherries on any day! Before making a
claim with the USPS, check to make sure your pack-
age was actually covered by Postal Insurance, which
was purchased at the time of mailing. If you use pri-
vate insurance instead, you don’t make a claim to
the Post Office.
If an item arrives at the buyer’s door damaged, you
may immediately make a claim with the Post Office.
When a package is lost in transit, the Post Office
puts some time constraints on your making a claim.
That is, you must wait a minimum of 30 days after
the mailing date before you make the claim.
There’s always a question as to who makes the claim:

Damaged or loss of contents: Either the seller or
the buyer can make the claim.

Complete loss: When a package never turns up
after 30 days and it’s officially MIA, the seller
must be the one to file a claim.
First, you must go to the Post Office to get a copy of
PS Form 1000, Domestic Claim or Registered Mail
inquiry. (The Post Office doesn’t have this form cur-
rently on the Web site for download.) Fill out the
form with all the details required and bring your
backup information.
To make a damage claim, you must produce evi-
dence of insurance. This can be either of the follow-
ing documents:

Original Mailing Receipt: The receipt that was
stamped at the Post Office counter when the
item was mailed.

Original box or wrapper: This must show the
addresses of both the sender and the recipient
along with whatever tags or stamps the Post
Office put on the package to say it’s insured.
If only the box or wrapper is presented as
proof of insurance, the Post Office will likely
limit the claim to $100.
You must also produce evidence showing the value
of the item when it was mailed. The list below shows
some of the documents accepted by the Post Office
for damage claims. Be prepared that they may ask
for more thorough proof.

Technique 40: Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
240
The Post Office used to run these auctions on eBay under the
user ID usps-mrc-everythingelse. I used to buy some
great case lots from them and turn around and resell the
goods on eBay! (You can still find the USPS About Me
page at http://members.ebay.com/ws2/eBayISAPI.dll?
ViewUserPage&userid=usps-mrc-everythingelse.)
Now the Post Office sells the stuff at live auctions. If think
you’d like to attend one, check the Post Office site at www.
usps.com/auctions for dates and times. The Post Office
always has good stuff for sale and usually in good quantity
(not everything is trashed).
If you’re interested in buying Post Office surplus, check it out
on eBay under sellers usps-ne-springfield and usps-
al-pmsc.
Filing a Claim with UPS
Whoa! The stories of filing claims with UPS are leg-
endary. Almost any eBay seller can tell you quite a
story. I must admit that making a claim with UPS is a
good deal easier than making a claim with the Post
Office. At least, once your damage claim is filed and
accepted, you get a check within five days.
For damaged packages, UPS recently streamlined the
process as well, although the buyer must make the
claim. You can (if you really want to) call 1-800-PICK-
UPS (cute, eh?) to file your claim. The better idea is
to go directly to the online reporting form at www.
ups.com/content/us/en/resources/service/
tracking/claims.html. Be sure you make your
report to UPS within 48 hours of delivery.
On the online claim form, you’ll be asked to input all
information about the package and the damage. UPS
seems to be very familiar with its own handiwork;
you get to select a particular type of damage from a
menu.
Once you’ve filled out and submitted the form, just
sit on your haunches and wait for the UPS claims
department to contact you.

Sales receipt or descriptive invoice.

Copy of your cancelled check or money order
receipt.

Picture and description of a similar item from a
catalog if your receipt isn’t available.

A letter from the seller stating the value of the
item.

Your own description of the item. Include date
and time the item was purchased and whether it
is new or vintage.
For missing packages, you (the seller) need a letter
from the buyer (dated 30 days after the package was
mailed) stating that they never received the package.
If your buyer is too cranky to cooperate, go to the
Post Office where you mailed the package. Ask for a
written statement that there is no record of the
delivery being made. Postal employees can look up
the insurance or Delivery Confirmation numbers to
find whether the delivery took place, but the Post
Office will charge you $6.60 for their efforts. That
amount will be reimbursed if the Post Office pays
your claim and doesn’t locate your package under a
bale of hay in Indiana.
If all goes well and your claim is deemed legit, you
should get your payment within 30 days. If you don’t
hear from the Post Office within 45 days (maybe the
payment got lost in the mail?), you have to submit a
duplicate claim using the original claim number.
Note to self (and to you): Always make a copy
of any form you give to the government.
Buying lost packages
When the Post Office pays your claim, it will usually ask to
keep your item. Your item and thousands of others will end
up at one of the Mail Recovery Centers across the country.
Here it joins the other lost and salvage mail to be sold, usu-
ally at auction.

Filing with FedEx
241
I recommend that you print your form after
filling it out so you can keep all reference
information for the claim in one place.
After the buyer makes the claim, UPS sends a Damage/
Loss Notification Letter form to the seller. The seller
must fill out the form to state the item’s value and
attach supporting documentation. The form can then
be faxed back to UPS for final verification.
Save the damaged item and all the packaging
that it came in. UPS may send an inspector
out to look at the package before approving a
claim.
If a UPS shipment appears to be lost, the seller must
call UPS to request a package tracer. If UPS is unable
to prove delivery, the claim is paid.
Filing with FedEx
Filing a claim with FedEx is similar to the UPS proce-
dure, except FedEx gives you a little more leeway as
to time. Instead of the 48-hours-after-delivery dead-
line, you have 15 business days to make your claim.
(This extra time sure helps out when a package is
delivered to your house and you’re out of town.)
FedEx processes all Concealed Loss and Damage
claims within five to seven days after receiving all
the paperwork and information.
As with UPS, keep all packaging, including the carton,
along with the item in case FedEx wants to come and
inspect the damage.
You can make your FedEx claim in a couple of ways:

By fax: You can download a PDF claim form with
instructions at www.fedex.com/us/customer/
claims/Claims.pdf.
Fill out the form and fax it to the number on the
form.

Online: Fill out the online claim form on a secure
server at https://www.fedex.com/us/claims
online.
To file a claim online, you must have a FedEx
login to begin your claim. (See Technique 38 on
how to get this.) If you file your claim online,
you’ll still have to mail or fax in your supporting
documentation. When you file online, you can
also choose to receive e-mail updates from FedEx
regarding your claim (good idea!).
The claim payment will be sent to the seller, so
it’s up to the seller to make restitution with the
buyer. The result should be as it is in the side-
bar “A couple of claim stories” — as soon as
the claim is approved, a refund should be
made.


Part VII
Working the eBay
Community

Opening an eBay
Store
O
pening an eBay Store can expand your business. The more that
savvy buyers learn about eBay Stores, the more popular they
become. The more popular they become, the more people buy
from them. Simple. An eBay Store provides you with your own little cor-
ner of eBay in which you can leverage your good relationships with your
customers to promote your auctions and to sell directly to them. But
eBay Stores are not a total solution, and having an eBay Store isn’t a one-
way ticket to easy street.
I get emails all the time from people who open an eBay Store and are not
successful in moving merchandise. Why? Because running an eBay Store
takes an extra level of effort. The more energy you invest in your eBay
business, the more work you have to do. Simple. No matter how many
“money-back guarantees” you receive from online spammers promising
magical success on eBay, the only magic is putting your nose (and shoul-
der) to the grindstone and exerting the effort necessary to bring cus-
tomers to your store.
eBay wants you to succeed as well. Although I’m sure they like getting
the monthly fee for the store, they’d much rather see your sales grow.
After all, the more you sell, the more eBay earns in Final Value Fees.
If you’re just beginning on eBay, the best advice I can give is to hold
off on opening an eBay Store until your feedback rating is over 100.
Participating in transactions on eBay is a natural teacher because you’ll
see mistakes that sellers make when they sell to you. You’ll get emails
from sellers that are plain unfriendly, and you’ll have a true understand-
ing of how quality customer service will help you build your business.
You’ll also learn from your own mistakes and be able to provide better
service to your customers.
The purpose of expanding your eBay business is to make more money,
not to start losing money. Big businesses expand in order to make more
money, even though their costs may increase. There’s always a risk
involved in any business venture, but with experience on the site and
what you learn in this book, hopefully you can minimize the risk.

The items listed as store inventory will not
come up in an eBay search. The only ways
new buyers can find your store inventory is by
clicking the search Stores tab in eBay search
by searching items on the store hub page, or
by clicking from one of your auction pages to
see what else you have on sale.
Choosing between store types
Different real estate has different costs. Just like
opening a store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills is
going to cost more than a store in Dipstick, North
Dakota; opening an eBay Store has different start up
costs. But the best part is, that the old real estate
adage “location, location, location” counts only in
real estate — when you’re on eBay, you have an
excellent chance to get new customers.
All eBay Stores are on a level playing field. You can
be right up there with the big guys and compete.
The only cost differential is the type of store you
wish to open. They’re all equally searchable for the
eBay Stores hub page, as pictured in Figure 41-1.
• Figure 41-1: The eBay Stores landing page.
Making the “Store” Decision
So you think it’s time to open a store, eh? If you feel 
it in your gut and you’re ready to take the leap, here’s
what you need to know. eBay has very few require-
ments when it comes to opening an eBay Store:

Registered User: You need to be a Registered
User on the eBay site.

Feedback rating: You must have a feedback rating
of 20 or more or be ID verified.
It doesn’t get much easier than that! Personally, I like
to add these additional prerequisites to back you up
for success:

PayPal Account: You need to have a Business or
Premier (personal) PayPal account to accept
credit cards. Accepting credit cards is a neces-
sity for building sales, and PayPal is integrated
directly into the site, as well as being widely
accepted by buyers.
Be sure you understand how a PayPal account
works so you can decide on the types of pay-
ments you will accept — and from which coun-
tries you intend to do business. (See Part V for
in-depth discussions on PayPal.)

Sales Experience: Having selling (and buying)
experience over and above the 20 transactions
required by eBay is a big plus. The best teacher
(aside from this book) is the school of hard
knocks.

Merchandise: Opening an eBay Store with ten
items that you only have one each of isn’t a good
idea. You need to have enough merchandise to
support consistent sales in your store.

Devotion: You need to have the time to check
into your eBay business at least once a day, and
the time to handle shipping the purchased mer-
chandise in a prompt manner.

Making the “Store” Decision
247
All eBay stores share these features:

Listings: All of your eBay listings, whether auc-
tion, fixed price or store inventory, will appear in
your eBay Store.

Custom URL: Your eBay Store will have its own
Internet address that you can use in links in pro-
motional material — even to promote your store
on the Internet (see Part IX).

Store Search: When customers visit your eBay
Store, they will be able to search within your list-
ings for their desired item — with your own per-
sonal search engine.

Cross-Promotions: You have the ability to insert
thumbnail promotions for your store items
within each of your items for sale on the regular
eBay site.

Seller Reports: You’ll receive monthly reports on
your store sales via e-mail.
Although you will need to pay a small fee for each
listing, eBay Store rental is available on three levels:

Basic Store: For $9.95 a month, you get your own
eBay Store with all the benefits.

Featured Store: You get all the benefits of a Basic
Store, plus there will be a link to your store from
the store category page and randomly on the
eBay Stores hub page (refer to Figure 41-1). You
also get more advanced sales reports. This type
of store will set you back $49.95 per month.

Anchor Store: This is a top-of-the-line store on
eBay. For $499.95 a month, your store logo rotates
with others on the home hub page of eBay stores.
Your logo also randomly appears on eBay’s home
page. When prospective buyers are browsing
eBay Store categories, your logo will show up
at the top of the pages.
There is no limit to the number of items you
put up for sale in the Basic Store. An Anchor
Store can have as few or as many items as the
Basic Store.
For the independent seller, a Basic Store will do the
trick. Many high-level PowerSellers find that the
basic eBay Store fulfills their needs.
Knowing the fee structure
There are other fees involved (are you surprised?).
There are listing fees, options fees, and Final Value
Fees, as shown in Tables 41-1, 41-2, and 41-3.

Listing your items for a looong time may be a
tempting way to automate your listings — and
it’s a good strategy. Remember, though, that
once someone makes a purchase from an item
listing, you can no longer make massive
changes — you can only update inventory. If
you have a new picture or new ideas for a title
or description, you must close that listing and
relist the item with the new information. But
heck, it’s only 2¢!

Setting Up Your Store
If you’re up to the task of opening a store, read on to
find out about the things you need to have ready
before you open your eBay Store.
It’s best to sit down during some uninterrupted quiet
time to plan your store. Opening a store properly
involves adding additional store information (such
as the name and description of your store), and writ-
ing it out first really helps you to gather your
thoughts.
To open a store, go to the eBay home page and click
the link in the upper-left corner (under Specialty
Sites, as shown in Figure 41-2) for eBay Stores. You
can also go there directly by typing the URL
http://stores.ebay.com
Although eBay may change the step-by-step
procedure for opening a store, you’ll still need
to have all the information in the Setting Up
your Store Content area.

When someone visits your eBay Store, there’s
no way they will know whether you’re a Basic,
Featured, or Anchor Store. The design of your
store is up to you – you can make it as fancy
as you wish.
How to save 50 percent on your 
Store Final Value Fees
Yes! The honchos at eBay are really smart. By promoting
your eBay Store on your Web site and linking to your eBay
Store, you can save 50 percent of your Final Value Fees on
the items you sell though the referral link. It’s a win-win sit-
uation. You draw people to your eBay Store, where you can
have a more robust layout and features and save on fees —
and eBay gets more visitors coming to the site!
In order to get the referral bonus, you must set up a special
link. The link consists of your eBay Store URL, and some
code. Here’s my referral link with the referral code in bold

home page.
Setting up your store content
To set up your store, you have to go through several
steps. The first is the basic store content.
1.
Click the Open Store Now bar (and you also get
the first 30 days free) to begin.
2.
Enter your initial Store Content. This entails:
 The name of your eBay Store. I hope you’ve
thought of something catchy, and perhaps
something that’s a bit general. If you name
your store Patti’s Video Shop and someday
choose to also sell clothing, your store name
won’t properly reflect your merchandise. You
can always change your store name, but the
Internet address for your store includes the
store name — any links you’ve sent out with
the old URL won’t work to bring repeat buyers
back to your store.
 Your payment information: Your payment
information includes the name to which you’d
like your payments addressed.
 Address: Enter the address to which you want
payments sent.
 Phone number (optional): If you want buyers
to be able to see your phone number when
checking out after a purchase.
 Store description: This is important. The text
you type in here will appear in the header box
of all your store pages. It should be short, but
full of descriptive keywords. You have only
250 characters for your Store Description.
Keywords work for you in the Store
Description in two ways. First, people search-
ing only store names and descriptions from an
eBay Store search with keywords will find your
item easily. It will also work to bring buyers
from the Internet as Web Search engine spi-
ders may pick up your keywords.

ters to list your store’s specialties. You can

If you want to type out this information in advance (a good
idea), use Microsoft Word. To count the characters in text
for areas where a segment of text allows a limited character
count:

Type out your idea of the text you’d like to use. 

Highlight the text.

Click Tools➪Word Count.

Your total count will be found in the line Characters
(with spaces).
As long as you’re in Word, use the spell checker before
copying your text onto the Store Content page.
 Categories: Giving the items in your store
custom categories are a great idea. They will
be displayed on the left side of your store

Technique 41: Opening an eBay Store
250
There is also a 200-character area where you
may optionally input additional shipping
information.
 Sales Tax: Input your state here and the sales
tax as a percentage. eBay will automatically
calculate sales tax when items are shipped
within your home state.
There is also a 200-character text box to input
additional tax information. If you accept a
resale number from buyers within your own
state that are buying to resell, you might indi-
cate that here. If you’ve nothing extra to say,
just pass the text box by.
 Customer Service & Return Policy: If you
have a return policy or additional information,
you have a 90-character space to spell it out
here.
 Additional Store Information: If you’ve just
got oodles more to say about your store, you
can say it here (okay, oodles means 200 more
characters in this case).
Designing your store’s “look”
Now comes the fun part. Here’s where you can cus-
tomize the look of your eBay Store. The choices you
make here will design the way your store looks —
it’s your opportunity to make your store stand out.
1.
Select a color scheme.
Since not everyone is an HTML color expert,
eBay graciously has quite a few pretested color
combinations that you can use for your store.
Click the drop-down box to select a color combi-
nation by name. If you want to view the colors
prior to selecting them (an excellent idea), click
the link on this page that says Preview Colors
Below.
You also have the option of selecting your own
Hexadecimal colors. Huh? Yes, that’s what I said.
Click the little color box next to the text boxes
home page and will help buyers find their way
to the specific types of items they’re looking
for. You may add up to 20 different categories.
They will only show up in your store directory
if you list an item in them.
3.
Indicate your Store subscription level.
This is where you decide (by putting a check
mark in the check box) which type of store you
wish to open.
4.
Add About Your Store information.
This information will show up on your Store
Policies Page, as shown in Figure 41-3.
• Figure 41-3: Store Policies page from my eBay Store.
 Payment Methods: You need to indicate
which payment methods you’ll accept in your
store.
 Store Ship-To Locations and Shipping &
Handling: Designate which countries you will
ship to if you ship internationally. If you ship
only to the United States, you must specify
that here.

Setting Up Your Store
251
here, and get a teeny color chart. If you roll your
mouse over the teeny boxes, you’ll see the
HTML hexadecimal numbers for that color as
in Figure 41-4.
If the teeny boxes don’t give you enough of a
taste of the colors, you can go to my Web site
www.coolebaytools.com and find a link in the
Tips area to a very large sampling of hundreds
of colors and their hexadecimal numbers.
• Figure 41-4: Selecting your Store Appearance colors.
2.
Choose your store graphic.
eBay has a bunch of clean looking banners avail-
able here for your store’s home page. You can
use one of those if you want your store looking
like everyone else’s.
To get a reasonably priced custom graphic
for your eBay Store, search eBay for eBay
(banner, banners). I just did and found 86
buy-it-now listings for people who are willing
to design a custom banner for under $20.
Be sure you like the samples of the seller’s
designs and are comfortable with their terms
before you buy.
Do yourself a favor and get a custom-designed
banner just for your store. You can always
change it if you want, but it will go a long way
to add professionalism to your store.
3.
Add additional store header information.
Here you can input even more information about
your store. eBay gives you an HTML generator to
accomplish this here. If you have time to do this,
fine. If not, don’t make yourself crazy — just put
up good items and sell them.
4.
Choose the item default display.
Select the way you’d like your items to appear.
They can appear as a list, just like regular eBay
listings, or you can select the Gallery View, as
shown in Figure 41-5.
• Figure 41-5: My store with Gallery view layout.
5.
Choose the item display order.
You can select the order in which your items will
appear in your store:
 Highest prices first
 Lowest prices first
 Ending soonest first
 Ending latest first

Technique 41: Opening an eBay Store
252
Don’t feel bad if you don’t want to devote the time
and effort into designing a custom page. I opted not
to. I would rather err on the side of caution — my
HTML talent really isn’t up to snuff. I’ll let my items
do the talking!
When you finish with these steps, press the button
that says Save Changes and Publish. Your new store
should be ready for action within the hour.
Designing a custom store home page
If you want your eBay Store to be totally customized
and you’re comfortable with writing HTML, you can
design a custom home page for your store in this
area.
If you don’t want a custom home page, just check the
box that says No, do not include a custom home page.

Building Your
Reputation by
Becoming a
PowerSeller
W
hen you browse through the items on eBay, you’re bound to
notice a PowerSeller icon next to another member’s user ID. To
the uninitiated, this may look like an award given to a used car
salesman for bullying hundreds of people into expensive car leases —
but it’s not. The eBay PowerSeller status is given only to those sellers
who uphold the highest levels of professionalism on the site.
eBay refers to them as “pillars of the community.” I say they’re smart
businesspeople. PowerSellers have to maintain certain monthly levels
of Gross Merchandise Sales (total dollar amount of eBay sales — GMS
in eBayspeak), and they get there by providing good items for sale and
excellent customer service.
You may notice that many sellers on the site with feedback ratings in the
tens of thousands do not have the PowerSeller embellishment on their
auctions. That’s not because they’re not good people, it’s just that some
of their transactions may have gone awry. In this case, be sure to check
the seller’s feedback and thoughtfully evaluate it. Many times buyers do
not read the seller’s policies before they buy and then give negative feed-
back (as in the case of buyers not reading the seller’s warnings when
buying liquidation merchandise).
To become a PowerSeller on eBay, you must fulfill the following
requirements:

Be an active seller for at least 90 days

Sell a minimum of 4 items on the site per month for the past 3 months

Have a minimum of a 100 feedback rating

Maintain a feedback percentage of at least 98 percent

Keep your eBay account current

Comply with all eBay listing policies

Run your business by upholding eBay’s community values (see sidebar)

Sell a minimum average of $1,000 a month in GMS


Health care: PowerSellers and their immediate
family have the opportunity to purchase exclu-
sive health insurance.

Approved use of PowerSeller logo: eBay sup-
plies PowerSellers with business card and sta-
tionery templates so they may print custom
stationery and business cards that include the
official PowerSeller logo.

Discounts: eBay partners offer special discounts
off services to eBay PowerSellers.
Becoming an eBay PowerSeller is an important step
to eBay professionalism. It’s something worth aspir-
ing to!
eBay community values
The set of eBay community values aren’t taken lightly by
the eBay community and eBay employees. The values were
set out early on by the company’s founder, Pierre Omidyar.

We believe people are basically good. 

We believe everyone has something to contribute.

We believe that an honest, open environment can
bring out the best in people. 

We recognize and respect everyone as a unique
individual.

We encourage you to treat others the way that you
want to be treated. 
All eBay sellers are expected to uphold these tenets in all
their dealings on the site. 
Okay, no snickering from the peanut gallery, we all know
that there are quite a few sellers who don’t follow these pre-
cepts. But then, they’re not PowerSellers, are they?
PowerSeller Tiers
Being a PowerSeller provides membership in an
exclusive club, and there are five different levels of
membership. Members of the different tiers must
sell to a certain level every month.
Each PowerSeller tier gives the Seller more privi-
leges from eBay. One of the most valuable benefits
is that when an issue needs to be addressed with
eBay, the PowerSellers can access priority customer
service support (see Table 42-1).

Becoming an eBay
Trading Assistant
W
hat is an eBay Trading Assistant? Simply, an eBay Trading
Assistant sells merchandise for people on eBay. A more complex
definition is that a Trading Assistant sells items on consignment
for those who are not familiar with the eBay site or are simply too lazy to
learn the ropes. Several chains have opened up across the country with
retail locations accepting merchandise from the general public to do just
this. By becoming an official Trading Assistant, you can compete with the
big boys in your own area.
The best part is that if you are running your eBay business out of your
home, from a garage, or from a low-rent industrial office, you’re a step
ahead of the big guys who have to pay high rents in fancy neighborhoods
to get their “drop in” business. They also have to hire people who are
familiar with setting up auctions on eBay — aren’t you already set up for
that?
eBay will help the individual Trading Assistants with many things. Most
importantly, you’re listed in a searchable directory with other eBay
selling professionals for all the world to find at www.eBay.com/
tradingassistants.
Becoming a Trading Assistant
The first thing to take into consideration before becoming a Trading
Assistant is to be sure you’re familiar with the eBay site, the rules and
regulations, and most of all — experienced in selling items at a profit. To
be a successful Trading Assistant, you need to be savvy about how to
research items on eBay (see Part I) and also know how to parlay keywords
into winning auction titles (Part II).
The Trading Assistant directory appears on the eBay site at www.eBay.com/
tradingassistants, as shown in Figure 43-1. From the directory page,
potential customers can search for a Trading Assistant to sell their items
by ZIP code, telephone area code, or by country. I just ran a search and
at this moment there seem to be no Trading Assistants in Jamaica or the
Bahamas (they might be a nice place to do business from)!

to check this out beforehand and explain the
realities to them.

Coordinating the listing. Take digital photos and
write a complete and accurate description of
the item.

Keeping a close accounting of fees and money
collection.
That’s not much in the way of requirements, but you
need to get some things together before you sign up.
Becoming a Trading Assistant does not make
you an employee, agent, or independent con-
tractor of eBay. You should be careful to refer
to yourself as an independent business.
When you sign up as a Trading Assistant, you have
to fill out a form describing your business to
prospective customers. Think through the things
you have to say before posting them. Your informa-
tion here works like an ad for you. Here are the
things you have to put on your Trading Assistant
listing page.

Personal information: This includes your eBay
User ID, your real name, address, and languages
spoken.

Category Specialty: If you specialize in a particu-
lar category, be sure to mention it. You may indi-
cate up to three eBay home page categories.

Service Description: In this area, you can say
as little or as much as you like about your eBay
experience and the services you provide.
Remember that the more you communicate in
advance, the more successful you’ll be.
Here is a sample Service Description:
I’ve been active on the site since 1996 and am
an eBay PowerSeller. I specialize in selling all
types of eBay items and am particularly famil-
iar with the fashion category. I can handle
large numbers of listings. Please contact me
so that we can discuss your particular needs
and time availability.
• Figure 43-1: The Trading Assistants directory page.
This page is promoted on the eBay site to new users
and in eBay Promotions. Being listed on this page
will help your customers find you.
eBay makes it very clear that whether you fulfill the
requirements for Trading Assistant or not, being a
Trading Assistant is a privilege. If eBay receives com-
plaints about your services, they have the right to
remove you from the Trading Assistant directory.
eBay’s requirements are:

Listings: You must have sold at least 4 items in
the last 30 days.

Feedback Rating: You must have a minimum rat-
ing of 50 or higher, while maintaining a minimum
of 97 percent positive comments.
As a Trading Assistant, you will acquire merchandise
and sell it on eBay on consignment. You will also be
responsible for

Consulting with consignors about their items.

Researching the value of the item. Many non-
eBay users may have unreasonable expectations
of the price their items will sell for. It’s your duty

I can visit your home within 15 miles from
my place of business to inventory the items.
I will list, ship, and provide you with an item-
ized list of all items sold with the sale price
and my fees.

Policy Description: Ensure that the consignees
understand your policies. A sample description
looks like this:
I will list your items for two listing cycles,
spread up to 30 days. If items do not sell, they
will be returned to you. Items must be in my
possession to be submitted to eBay unless
prior contractual arrangements are made in
advance. I handle all correspondence and
shipping. A consignment contract is required.
I also do independent consulting specializing
in Internet auctions and their application to
your business.

Fee Description: This is where you need to do
some research. Search your own telephone area
code on the Trading Assistant directory page and
see what other fees are being charged in your
area. After you have an idea of what you want to
charge, you can put that information here.
You can provide incentives for higher-value
items by charging lower commissions (such
as 40 percent if an item sells for less than $50,
30 percent if the item sells for more). Also,
charging a higher percentage and including
fees allows an easier fee discussion with
the client (for example, “40 percent, all fees
included” is generally simpler than “30 percent
and you pay all the fees, which include. . . .”)
Many Trading Assistants also use transaction
fees for listing with a reserve (knowing it prob-
ably won’t sell because the consignor doesn’t
have a fair guess at market valuation).
When you’ve decided everything you need to list,
click the link on the Trading Assistant homepage
that says Become a Trading Assistant. Fill out
the forms and, just like magic, you’ve become a
Trading Assistant!
Promoting Your Business
When I was working in the newspaper advertising
business, we had a saying about someone who
opened a new store: If all the advertising they do is
their Grand Opening ad and nothing after; it won’t
be long before you’ll be seeing the Going Out-of-
Business Sale ad.
The same is true with your Trading Assistant busi-
ness. Although you may not go out of business if you
don’t promote it, you’ll probably have no business
at all.
eBay gives you many tools to help you grow your
consignment business, even a co-op advertising pro-
gram. For more information on co-op advertising,
visit Technique 58.
Adding the Trading Assistant
logo to your eBay listings
Your best customers may come from people who see
your existing items when browsing eBay. Why not
show all viewers that you’re a Trading Assistant? Put
the Trading Assistant logo into your listings, as
shown in Figure 43-2. When a prospective customer
clicks on the link, they will be sent to your Trading
Assistant Information page (just as if they searched
you out in the directory).
• Figure 43-2: The eBay Trading Assistant link.
Insert the Trading Assistants logo when your
regular eBay business is slow, and take it out
when you’re overly busy. That way you can
control the amount of work you have.

Technique 43: Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
258
Even if you don’t see flyers in a retail location, ask
the owner of the business if you can put one up —
maybe even offer a discount to the business owner
for selling their items on eBay in exchange!
To get to the eBay collateral materials (flyers
and posters) go to http://pages.eBay.com/
TradingAssistants/collateral/index.html. On this
page, you can find the current graphical offerings
from eBay.
The posters and window signs are in Microsoft Word
format so that you can customize them with your
own business information. The flyer/poster, shown
in Figure 43-3, includes small tear-off strips where
you can place your contact information. When peo-
ple see your promotion, they can just snip off your
phone number (or e-mail address) and contact you
when they get home.
• Figure 43-3: The Trading Assistants Flyer.
To add the link to your listings, you have to use a lit-
tle HTML. Don’t panic though, because I supply the
code for you below. To get the code for your per-
sonal Trading Assistant link, follow these steps:
1.
Find out your Trading Assistant number.
Go to your listing in the directory. Take a look at
the top of your Internet browser, and you will see
your Trading Assistant number (this is also your
eBay account number) at the end of that Web
page’s URL. The Web address looks like this:
http://contact.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.
dll?ShowMemberToMemberDetails&member=
000000
In this example, your number would be 000000.
2.
Add code to your listing description.
Add the following HTML code at the end of your
listing description (be sure to replace 000000
with your own eBay number):
<center>
<a href=”http://contact.ebay.com/aw-
cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ShowMemberToMemberD
etails&member=000000”>
<b>I am a Trading Assistant - I can
sell items for you!</b>

vspace=”5” border=”0” height=”33”
width=”88”></a>
<br>
After you insert this code in your listings, a link
and button appear in your eBay sales (refer to
Figure 43-2).
Posting flyers
eBay has designed a nifty flyer that you can cus-
tomize and print out on your own printer. Put it up
at the supermarket, the car wash, the cleaner —
anywhere and everywhere flyers are allowed.

Handling Your Business Professionally
259
Handling Your Business
Professionally
Handling merchandise that’s not yours takes respon-
sibility, and how you conduct your business can
demonstrate to your customers that you’re a respon-
sible person. You need to present a professional
appearance when you meet your client, and you
should have a professional attitude in your dealings.
Being professional also means anticipating possible
problems. In addition to being very clear about
financial issues with your clients (especially fees and
the realistic selling value of your clients’ merchan-
dise), you may want to consider getting additional
insurance to cover the merchandise you are holding
in your home.
You may also want to consider designing a few forms
to reinforce with your clients that this is your busi-
ness and that you know it well, for example:
Inventory form: This form lists the entire inventory
you receive from the client and should include as
detailed a description of the item as your client can
supply. Also, include the minimum amount (if any)
the client will accept for the item — this will be your
reserve price if necessary.
Sales Agreement: Professional Trading Assistants
have their clients sign a Sales Contract. Read the
sidebar following for some good suggestions on
what to put in your contract. Since I’m not an attor-
ney, you should have a lawyer take a look at your
contract before you use it.
Important items for your Trading
Assistant contract
The information below was graciously supplied by one of
eBay’s successful Trading Assistants, LikePhate (Kate & Phil
Bowyer). It includes quotes from their own Trading Assistant
contract that cover many things that you might overlook
when you put together your own contract. This, of course,
is not a full agreement, but it provides some of the salient
points not to forget.
Be sure to include an explanation of the consignment
process: 

The Consignor will bring item(s) to the Seller, who,
upon both parties signing this contract, will take pos-
session of the items for the duration of the auction.

Acceptance of any item consigned will be at the
Seller’s sole discretion.

The Seller will inspect the item(s) for quality and
clean if necessary (a fee may apply).

The Seller will take quality photographs and write an
accurate description of item(s).

The Seller will research eBay® for similar items to
assure proper pricing.

The Seller will start the auction(s) and handle all
aspects of the sale including correspondence with
bidders.

The Seller will collect payment from the winning bid-
der (“Buyer”) at the end of the auction and will ship
the item(s) in a timely manner, once funds have
cleared.

The Seller will follow-up the sale by contacting the
Buyer to make sure they are satisfied with the
transaction.

Once the Seller and Buyer are satisfied with the
transaction, payment will be made to the Consignor.

The Seller will keep the Consignor aware of the auc-
tion progress either by telephone, or e-mail and by
supplying the Consignor the auction number(s) to
track the item(s) themselves.

The Seller will return unsold item(s) to the Consignor
upon payment of outstanding fees.
It’s also a good idea to provide the consignor with a state-
ment of items sold, summarizing the total purchase price,
all fees, and the amount the consignor receives.
Outline your fees. “The Consignor will be billed the actual
rates and fees as incurred for all services, to include the Seller’s
00% Commission. Any services or upgrades requested by

Technique 43: Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
260
You might also mention that you will only sell it if eBay poli-
cies allow the item to be sold.
“The Seller will do everything possible to secure the safety
of the Consignor’s item(s), however, the Seller is not
responsible for any damage to the item, including fire, theft,
flood, accidental damage or breakage, and acts of God. The
Consignor releases the Seller of any such responsibility for
any unforeseen or accidental damage.”
I choose to protect myself additionally, because reputation
on eBay is paramount. I have a small business rider on my
homeowner’s insurance with Allstate that covers merchan-
dise in my home up to $5,000. It’s an inexpensive addition
to your policy — definitely worth looking into.
Ending a sale prematurely. “If such an instance arises that
the Consignor demands the item(s) to be pulled, the
Consignor will pay a cancellation fee of $75. Items will not
be surrendered to Consignor until this fee is paid in cash.”
Protect yourself from possible shill bidding. An important
line you should add protects you from possible shill bid-
ding. How about: The Consignor also agrees not to place a
bid on an auction that the Seller has listed for the
Consignor (hereafter “Shill Bid”) on eBay, nor to arrange for
a Shill Bid to be made on the behalf of the Consignor by a
third party. If the Consignor or an agent of the Consignor
submits a Shill Bid on an auction listed by the Seller, then
the Consignor agrees to pay all fees, commissions, and
penalties associated with that auction, PLUS a $75.00 fine,
and the Seller may refuse to grant auction services to the
Consignor in the future.
Again, I strongly suggest that you get professional advice
before putting together your own contract or agreement.
the Consignor will carry the exact fee and will be deducted
from payment, or after three (3) failed auction listings, will
be due to the Seller payable in cash. If the auction sells,
these fees will be subtracted from the winning bid before
the Consignor receives payment.”
Be sure to include a copy of current eBay fees: Listing,
Options, Reserves, PayPal, and Final Value Fees.
Outline the terms of your commission. “The Seller’s com-
mission for this service is a percentage based on the auc-
tion’s winning bid. If the auction does not sell, the Consignor
is only responsible to pay the applicable insertion and
reserve price auction fees. An Unsold Reserve fee of $0.00
will be due to the Seller for a reserve price auction that does
not sell.” 
Be sure you don’t guarantee the item will sell. “If an item
does not sell, the Seller will re-list it two additional times.
The Seller may contact the Consignor to discuss combining
individual items into lots to attract buyers. The Consignor’s
verbal consent, or e-mail consent, will be documented in the
Consignor’s file and will serve as a revision to this contract.
After a third unsuccessful listing, the Consignor will be
billed for the fees associated with all three auctions, plus a
$5.00 surcharge. Items will be returned to consignor upon
payment of those fees. Items not claimed within 14 days
from the end of the final listing will become the property of
the Seller.”
Protect yourself and your eBay reputation. “The Consignor
of said item(s) consents to the sale of said item(s) based
on the terms described in this agreement. The Consignor
also attests that said item(s) are fully owned by the
Consignor and are not stolen, borrowed, misrepresented,
bogus, etc.”

Getting the Stamp
of Approval from
SquareTrade
O
kay, SquareTrade doesn’t give you a stamp of approval; it’s techni-
cally a seal. But whether stamp or seal, having this small icon
associated with your items can boost your sales quite a bit. The
SquareTrade Seal is a known commodity in the eBay community with
buyers and sellers alike. When buyers see the SquareTrade Seal in an
auction, it’s an immediate tip off that they’re doing business with a reli-
able, honest seller. (See Technique 4 for more information on how the
seal works for the buyer.) This seal is the most widely recognized symbol
of trust on eBay, and you can view it in about two million listings a day.
This technique is concerned with getting the SquareTrade Seal with its
associated services and reports to work for you, the seller. One of the
best benefits is that showing the seal lowers the occurrence of negative
feedback. When people view the seal on your auctions, they feel more
trusting and at ease with buying from you. So if there’s a glitch in the
transaction, they’re far less apt to fly off the handle and leave you a nega-
tive feedback comment without contacting you.
SquareTrade conducted a survey, which included a study of 130,000 feed-
back ratings among 600 of its seal members, and found an astounding
result. The average seller noticed a remarkable 43 percent decrease in
negative feedback received after becoming a member. That’s pretty amaz-
ing. Although there’s no guarantee that you won’t get negatives (and you
still need to watch your Ps & Qs), the SquareTrade Seal certainly seems
to calm buyers’ nerves.
SquareTrade Stretches Beyond eBay
SquareTrade began operations in 1999 to service eBay sellers and to help
them handle disputes in transactions. The company grew steadily over
the years and established itself as an international leader in online dis-
pute resolution. SquareTrade has acted as key presenter on the issue of

Sellers can customize the look of the
SquareTrade seal and can choose whether it
appears on the top or the bottom of their item
descriptions. I like to have the seal appear at
the top of my listings so that buyers readily
see the seal as they read the item listing.

In addition to the handy seal, SquareTrade offers
sellers some other good tools and services:

autoposts the seal to any new listings you’ve
placed on eBay.

Seal Activity Reports: If you like the idea of put-
ting counters in your auctions to see how many
visitors you get, the Seal Activity Reports give you
totals (for a time period) of how many people
have looked at your auctions. Figure 44-3 shows
a segment of my current Seal Activity Reports. I
find it amazing that so many people have viewed
global online consumer protection to the Federal
Trade Commission, the European Union, and the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
It’s nice to know that a company working for
eBay members is so well respected worldwide.
For eBay sellers who subscribe to the seal,
SquareTrade offers many worthwhile tools to
help build their reputations and their busi-
nesses on eBay.
Making SquareTrade
Work for You
The best part about subscribing to SquareTrade
(and the main reason most sellers join) is that mem-
bers get to show off the seal and so become seal
holders. That ubiquitous lime-green-and-navy-blue
seal builds business. When potential buyers view
your eBay listings, they see a seal marked with the
current date. SquareTrade updates the seal daily and
roots out those sellers who have possibly joined the
dark side. 
SquareTrade runs 40 automated compliance checks
on seal holders daily. Anytime there’s an automated
alert, a human being (specifically, a SquareTrade
employee) checks to see what’s occurring with the
seal holder’s account and may then contact the seal
holder for further information. Figure 44-1 shows my
SquareTrade seal.
• Figure 44-1: My SquareTrade seal.
Notice that a clickable link appears on the left of the
seal. When the buyer clicks it, your SquareTrade
profile opens up in another window, as shown in
Figure 44-2.

my auctions during these time periods. (I don’t
keep many items listed when I’m writing a book.)
These totals are quite a testament to the number
of people who visit eBay every day.
• Figure 44-3: Can you believe this many people visited
my auctions?

eBay Sales Reports: As a seal holder, you’ll
be able to log on to your account on the
SquareTrade Web site and view a large array
of reports reflecting your eBay business.
Basic-level seal holders can view reports with
the following information:
 Average selling price
 Price comparison, sold versus unsold
 Percent of listings that sold successfully
 Monthly sales
 Number of listings sold
 Average number of bids per sold listings
 Bids-per-auction pie chart
 Feedback growth summary
Figure 44-4 shows a couple of sample reports
from my Business Reporting Center.
• Figure 44-4: From my SquareTrade business reports.

Seal Rewards: If another eBay member signs up
as a SquareTrade member through the seal link
to your listings, you receive $5.00 for the referral.
This is redeemable in auction services, gift cer-
tificates, and more. If people sign up through
your link on a regular basis, the rewards can pay
for your SquareTrade membership in no time!

Negative Feedback Notification: You have the
option of having SquareTrade notify you when-
ever (horrors!) negative feedback is posted to
your account. SquareTrade then works with you
and the other party through mediation — to
hopefully get the premature negative feedback
removed or withdrawn.

Buyer Protection program: When you’re a seal
holder, your buyers are covered under an addi-
tional Buyer Protection program. (For more
about this program, see Technique 3).

Technique 44: Getting the Stamp of Approval from SquareTrade

Internet seals of safety
When you travel the Internet, you see many seals. You hope
that the seals you see legitimately stand for something and
that the Web sites using them follow standards that ensure
some level of quality. Two of the most trusted seals are

BBBOnLine: The BBBOnLine seal qualifying process,
as with the SquareTrade Seal, actually investigates can-
didate seal holders to make sure they’re who they say
they are. Seal members also agree to participate in
arbitration and to accept visits from BBB (Better
Business Bureau) officials. The seal loosely costs about
$400 to $500 for small businesses and up to $5,000
for larger corporations.

Trust-e: Web sites may post a Trust-e seal provided
that the site posts a privacy statement and sticks to it.
Trust-e will investigate complaints about member sites
and yank the site’s seal if necessary. For Trust-e mem-
bers with annual sales below $1,000,000, the Trust-e
seal costs around $250. The price goes up to $5,000
for larger firms.
Although posting a well-known seal costs you money, doing
so has proven to be a business tactic that makes customers
feel at ease. Sometimes such expenditures just make good
business sense.
To qualify for the SquareTrade Seal, you must go
through an approval process that takes two to five
days. From any seal holder’s profile, click the See If
You Qualify link and take advantage of the 30-day
free trial to get the ball rolling. You start by supply-
ing information to SquareTrade, and SquareTrade
investigates your info in two areas:

Personal Information: Most seal applicants are
verified through Equifax, a prominent identity
verification service. SquareTrade checks your
information against Equifax’s consumer and busi-
ness databases for consistency.

eBay Selling History: SquareTrade runs 20 dif-
ferent checks on your eBay transaction history
through systems developed to identify at-risk
sellers from their feedback information, as well
as from the products bought and sold.

Buyer Alert e-mails. If you opt for the Buyer
Alert service, SquareTrade sends your bidders
an e-mail on your behalf letting them know that
you are committed to giving them a good buying
experience. Figure 44-5 shows a message sent to
one of my bidders.
• Figure 44-5: SquareTrade bidder alert e-mail.
Getting Your Own Seal
Having a SquareTrade Seal sounds like a pretty
sweet deal. And sweet deals usually have a catch or
two. With SquareTrade, the catches are

You have to qualify for the seal

You have to pay for your seal subscription

Getting Your Own Seal
265
After SquareTrade notifies you (through e-mail) that
you’re approved, you have to pay SquareTrade for
the right to become a seal holder. As of this writing,
the basic seal holder gets an initial 30-day free trial
and then pays $7.50 per month for all the services
described in the section “Making SquareTrade Work
for You.” You can also choose a Premium level of serv-
ices that offers more reports at a higher monthly fee.

Technique
Meeting Other
eBayers
T
here was a time when I would tell you that the eBay boards and
chat rooms were pretty much a waste of time. They’re great, I used
to say, if you only use eBay part time and enjoy the social aspect
of chatting with others online. But if you have a busy life, minutes can
become hours in the chats and boards, and you can burn through your
valuable time before you know it.
Today, however, I also see a bright side to the eBay community. It allows
you to make contact with others in your own situation — stay-at-home
moms and dads, coin collectors, guys into fishing gear, and people just
into socializing. There’s a vast group of people just like you in the eBay
community from every part of the world. Through the eBay community,
you can make contact with them and maybe even make a new friend
or two.
On the other hand, beware of getting caught up in heated discussions
that accomplish nothing except raising your blood pressure. In some of
the chat areas, differing opinions often rise up and people (being only
human) can get carried away. Although it may seem that your comments
are inconsequential, they may affect other people seriously. Giving
advice on things that you’re truly not an expert on may cause problems
down the road for other community members reading your posts.
Remember that everything you post in the eBay community is etched in
granite (okay, etched in cyberspace), and your User ID is attached to
your statements.
Navigating the eBay Community
The beginning of your journey into the world of personalized eBay-ing
starts at the eBay navigation bar, as shown in Figure 45-1. Click the word
Community and a drop-down subnavigation bar appears with links to the
overview page (that’s the page you’re currently on), talk, news, events,
and people.
Save Time By
 Connecting with the com-
munity through Groups
 Learning about your spe-
cialty from chat
 Understanding how the
boards work

Navigating the eBay Community
267
• Figure 45-1: The eBay navigation bar with the
Community sub-bar.
Scroll down the page and take a look at how eBay
divvies up these various areas. Below the Welcome
to eBay Community headline, you’ll see the four dif-
ferent areas and their links, as shown in Figure 45-2.
• Figure 45-2: The eBay Community hub page.
Participating in talk
Although the methods of communication are differ-
ent, the Talk area is where you can converse directly
with other members of the community. Talk covers
several areas:

Discussion boards: In discussion boards, you’ll
find community help boards, category-specific
discussion boards, general discussion boards,
workshops, and Giving Works boards.
Covered in the discussion area:
 Community help: About 25 boards are topi-
cally organized to provide help on eBay tasks,
such as bidding, shipping, technical issues,
and so on.
 Category-specific discussion boards:
Discussion regarding close to 40 different eBay
categories, such as Collectibles, eBay Motors,
Clothing, Shoes & Accessories, and more.
 General discussion boards: Discuss whatever
tickles your fancy here. Boards with neighbor-
hood-sounding names where you can stop in
and visit. Lots of free association chatter and
fun topics in these boards!
 Workshops board: This is the spot to find
“deirdre the pink” who hosts workshops on
various topics regarding eBay. She invites spe-
cialists in various areas to give online work-
shops. You can sign in and watch the posts as
the workshops happen, or sign on later and
read all the posts.
 Giving Works (charity) board. Here’s where
you go to talk to others regarding charitable
auctions on eBay.
“Pinks” are eBay employees who dart in and
out of the chat rooms and boards. They occa-
sionally answer questions and sometimes jump
in on the action. You can spot them easily, as
their posts are shaded with a light pink bar.

Chat rooms: Here’s where things can get hot and
heavy. People love the chat area for posting opin-
ions on eBay! 
In the Chat area you’ll find:
 General chat rooms: The classic eBay Café is
here, as well as the AOL Café, Emergency
Board, and others.
 Category-specific chat rooms: I just checked
them out; there’s even one for Furby collec-
tors! Lots of fun and lots of friends make this
an active area. It’s fun to check these boards


The Chatter: The Chatter is the monthly eBay
newsletter with bits of info and company
messages.
Understanding the differences in
posting between the boards
There’s quite a bit of difference among the methods
of posting and reading posts. The individual posts
are handled very differently in the various areas.
The Booksellers Discussion Board in the Boards area
is pictured in Figure 45-4.
• Figure 45-4: The Bookseller’s Discussion Board in action.
To post on the board, follow these steps:
1.
Post a question or comment by logging into the
boards at the top of the page.
2.
Click the Board Log-In link, and you’ll be trans-
ferred to the Sign In area.
3.
Type in your User ID and password and press
Sign In.
and see what’s hot and what’s not in the vari-
ous categories.

Question and answer boards: The Q&A Boards
are where you can post a question about all
things eBay — and hopefully someone will post
an answer to you quickly.
Topics cover all eBay services and tasks.
The most important part about the Talk area is
that no business is allowed! The chats are there
for discussion and comments, but not for post-
ing items to sell or buy.
Checking out what’s news
The eBay News area has some of the most important
links. From here you can go to the announcements
area that helps you stay on top of changes in the eBay
system.

General Announcements: Here’s where eBay
first posts announcements about new changes to
the system (as in Figure 45-3). If something looks
a little different to you one day while performing
a task on eBay, check here to see what’s up.

System Announcements: If something’s not work-
ing on the site, eBay will generally post informa-
tion about the temporary glitches. That way you
can check to see whether it’s your computer or
eBay that’s messing up!
• Figure 45-3: The General Announcement board for
February 14, 2004.

Navigating the eBay Community
269
You’ll be returned to the Board with the option
to post in a blank text box at the end of the posts.
4.
Type your query into the text box and click the
Post Message button.
The query is listed on the site for other inter-
ested parties to reply.
To reply to a post or to see what responses you have
to your own post, just return to the area and click on
the post. The number of responses will be listed
next to it in the Replies column.
eBay Chat rooms are for real-time (kind-of) chatting
as shown in Figure 45-5. Users type in their com-
ments and other users populating the particular
chat area can see their posts when they press
reload. If you find an interesting thread of conversa-
tion in the chatter, you can reload your page show-
ing the last 200 messages posted up to 24 hours
prior by using the drop-down menu. When the
boards are busy, however, the 200-message limit may
cover only an hour’s time.
• Figure 45-5: Chatting and reloading by time increment.
The Answer Center runs things on a slightly different
format. When you click on a subject you wish to
view, you will be presented with a list of questions,
as shown in Figure 45-6. You can post your own
question, or get the answer to a question you see.
To read all answers, click the View Answers link
at the bottom of the question.
• Figure 45-6: List of Questions from the eBay Answer
Center, Search questions.
Visiting the events
Here’s where you can find out what events are
planned for the eBay Community.

Calendar: Click the calendar link to see what
eBay is doing around the country. The calendar
links are clickable so that you can find out more
details on the various events.

Works hub page where you can search and check
out the charity auctions currently on the site.

Technique 45: Meeting Other eBayers
270
The groups give you the opportunity to join like-
minded people online (or even in person) and share
your eBay adventures.
How the community works for you
While writing this technique, I went to all the areas of the
community. I saw a post from another community member
saying that her mom’s WebTV unit had quit working and
she didn’t know what to do. Her mom was stuck on that
particular system and wanted nothing else. 
I emailed her, letting her know that my mom was also a
WebTV user, but had recently passed away. I offered her
my mom’s WebTV setup (including printer) for minimal
cost plus shipping. 
That’s what community can be all about!
Joining a Group
People hub is one of the fastest-growing areas on
eBay. Here’s where people start clubs or “groups”
with people of similar hobbies and ideas. I’m a mem-
ber of a couple of groups and enjoy reading the dis-
cussions (because they’re about subjects I care
about), even if I don’t post responses.
Figure 45-7 shows you the Groups home page, where
you can search new groups or sign into groups in
which you’re already a member.

Running an Efficient

Going Legit with
Your Business
I
f you’ve played around on eBay, had some fun, and made a few dollars,
then good for you — enjoy yourself! Once you start making serious
money, however, your business is no longer a hobby. Before you know
it, it’s time to consider some serious issues like business structure, tax
planning, and licenses. I say this because when you’re concentrating on
fulfilling multiple orders and keeping your customers happy, the last thing
you need is a G-man breathing down your neck. Worst-case scenario:
How about getting audited in December when you haven’t been keeping
good records all year?
In short, getting serious means making some decisions. It means getting
licenses that cost something, and, possibly, collecting and paying sales
tax. I know this sounds like stripping the fun out of doing business on
eBay, but taking a bit of time and effort now can save you a ton of trouble
later on.
Giving Your Business a Name
In most states in the U.S., you can find funny liner ads in the classified
section of the local newspaper. They’re called fictitious name statements,
and they need to be registered with your state before you can open a
bank account in a business’s name. They let the state know who owns
and operates a business. In California, you must file a fictitious name
statement within 40 days of the commencement of your business. (Other
state laws vary, so check the Web sites listed at the end of this technique
for more information on your state’s requirements.) Your statement must
also include a physical address where the business is operated — not a
mailbox address.
Before you assume registering a name isn’t required in your state,
be sure to check with your state’s business code (links to all 50 states
are at the end of this technique). Some states, such as Indiana, require
that a business’s assumed name be registered with the secretary of
state.

Technique 46: Going Legit with Your Business
274
You have four choices, and each has different tax
and legal ramifications. I’ll give you the highlights
here.
Sole proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is the simplest form of busi-
ness. No other form of business is easier to manage
or cheaper to run. A sole proprietorship is the form
of business that most business owners use when
they’re first starting out. Many people often gradu-
ate to a more formal business format when bigger
money comes in.
Keeping track of all expenses related to your eBay
business is crucial, even in a sole proprietorship.
(Especially as they act as tax deductions against
your profits.) Be sure to check Technique 47 for
information on what you need to keep records for.
A few highlights of sole proprietorships include:

Profits and expenses of the business appear
on the individual’s personal tax return on
Schedule C.

Sole proprietors (the owners of sole proprietor-
ships) are in complete control of the money and
are personally liable for paying all taxes.

Some benefits (such as health insurance) are not
directly deductible from business income.

Liability is all on the person owning the business.
If you’re acting as a Trading Assistant and some-
thing seriously goes wrong with an item you’ve
sold for another, you are liable for any damages.
Sole proprietorships are also the easiest businesses
to dissolve if you choose to end an enterprise.
Partnership
A partnership comprises two or more people. It’s a
slightly more complicated business format, in which
everything — profit, decision-making, liability, and
so on — is shared between the partners according
to terms governed by a partnership agreement.
In the states requiring publication, your fictitious
name statement must be published in an adjudicated
(officially approved) newspaper for a certain amount
of time. Ostensibly, this is to let the community
know that a business is starting and who owns it.
The newspaper will supply you with a proof of publi-
cation, which you keep in your files as a record of
your filing. You generally have to renew the state-
ment after a prescribed number of years.
Don’t waste your money!
There are all kinds of very expensive services on the Internet
that prey on the inexperienced; they’d be more than willing
to handle all the work for you — for a fat fee. Don’t waste
your money. If newspaper publication is required, look in
the phone book for a small community newspaper and call
them to see if they handle these type of legal ads. Most
small newspapers are 90 percent supported by the money
they make on filing legal ads. They’re the experts on these
types of filings — plus, you get to help out another small
business. Every 5 years, I file my company’s DBA (Doing
Business As) with the nice gray-haired lady at the newspa-
per with a single-room office.
After you have your proof of publication, you can
bring that to the bank and open an account in your
business’s name, which is a very important step in
separating your personal living expenses from the
business.
Deciding Your Business
Structure
I know that this may seem like a leap, but bear with
me. You need to decide in what form to set up your
business. You’re going to have to live with this deci-
sion for quite a long time, so I suggest you consult
with a tax professional or an attorney who’s familiar
with your situation. If you don’t know such a profes-
sional personally, ask around. Getting a personal
referral is far better than picking a name blindly
from the phone book. You might even get a good
referral from another eBay seller in your area.

Deciding Your Business Structure
275
A partnership should be formed by a written agree-
ment, which is a legal document. Each person in the
partnership contributes capital or services and both
share in the partnership’s profits and losses. The
income of a partnership is taxed on both partners,
based on the percentage of the business that they
own or upon the terms of the written agreement.
Highlights:

The written agreement forming the partnership
should outline everything to do with the
business:
 How to divide the profit and/or loss
 Compensation for each partner
 Restrictions of authority and spending
 How disputes will be settled
 What happens if the partnership dissolves?
 What happens to the partnership in case of
death or disability?

Profits from the business flow into the partners’
personal tax returns, although a separate tax
return must be filed in the partnership’s name.

The partners are personally equally liable for all
business debts and product liability.
Business decisions must be agreed upon by both
partners — sometimes that can get sticky!
To get some intensive information on putting
together your business structure, visit www.
nolo.com, a Web site that gives legitimate
information on do-it-yourself law.
Corporation
A corporation has a life of its own; it has its own
name and tax return and is a unique and separate
entity from the owners. It’s chartered by the secre-
tary of state within the state of incorporation (which
is usually the state in which you do business).
Federal taxes for corporations presently range from
15 to 35 percent, based on the corporation’s net
profits. Employee owners of corporations may shel-
ter income from tax by dividing the income between
their personal and corporate tax returns. This is fre-
quently called income splitting and involves setting
salaries and bonuses so that any profits left in the
company at the end of its tax year will only be taxed
at the 15 percent rate.
Setting up a corporation doesn’t have to be an
expensive venture. Check out the Nolo.com site
referred to in the tip above for packages to set one
up in your state.
Highlights of a corporation are these:

Shareholders (owners) have limited liability
for the corporation’s debts. You can lose only
the money you invested in the business; your per-
sonal property can attach in a few situations —
say, you guaranteed a loan for the business or
neglected to deposit your employees’ withhold-
ing taxes. Check with your attorney for more
caveats.

As an officer of a corporation, you are required
to report to federal and state agencies.

You must keep explicit records of expenses and
income.
Limited liability company (LLC)
A limited liability company is a new, hybrid type of
business that combines portions of a partnership
with bits of a corporation. It’s basically used when
you want the limited-liability advantages of a corpo-
ration and the ease of running a partnership.
Due to the newness of this type of business,
research the details at Nolo and talk to a profes-
sional to decide whether it’s best for your eBay
business.

City and State Business
Licenses
It seems like everyone has something to say about
your business, doesn’t it? Yep, lots of fingers in the
pie! When you’re part of the business community,
your business dealings will have an impact on many
more people than just you.
Cities and states issue business licenses to home
businesses as well as to large corporations. You’re
better off getting a license at the outset of an ongo-
ing business than to be forced to pay penalties later.
Table 46-1 is a chart of URLs to individual state’s
business links. These links should get you all the
info you need.
Making a decision on your business format
is important and can impact your business
for years to come. It’s best to get professional
advice before setting your ideas in concrete.
Joining the Feds
If you’re going to be paying anyone a salary, you’ll
need a Federal ID Number (FEIN). Every business
has one. It’s like a Social Security number for a
business — the number used to identify you on
government forms. You may also need one for
your state.
There’s no charge to get your FEIN, so why wait? 

A Federal Employee Tax ID number can be
assigned by filing IRS form SS-4. Go to the IRS
Web site at 
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/
0,,id=102767,00.html
to get the details and apply for your EIN online.

Simplifying Your
Bookkeeping
S
everal e-mails come to my office every week from people who have
questions about how to keep their books straight. (Incidentally,
although I don’t always have time to keep up with all my e-mail, rest
assured that I at least read every message.) These folks are confused by
the myriad of products and services vying for the eBay seller’s dollar.
Many of these products and services claim to do everything and that
running a business on eBay is impossible without them. These auction
services also claim to be all an eBay seller needs to achieve success, but
that’s not quite right. As much as auction management services do for
the seller — and they can do some amazing things — they can’t maintain
your books in the proper bookkeeping form.
With the advent of e-commerce, many aspects of the business world
updated and changed to keep pace with the speed of the Internet.
One thing that didn’t change, however, is the need for methodical,
rock-solid bookkeeping. Why can’t you do your bookkeeping your
way? Because the United States Tax Code demands that businesses
adhere to some tried and true accounting procedures.
It’s all well and good to manage your sales data in spreadsheets, note
pads, and homemade ledgers (I keep my PayPal monthly sales in spread-
sheets, but only as backup and customer-list documentation.) Just real-
ize that you’re making more work for yourself in the long run. Keeping
your books in ways that are easy for you to understand doesn’t preclude
the necessity of maintaining your books in the proper format. This tech-
nique helps you save time by putting some tested procedures for eBay
sellers to work for you.
Dealing with a Professional
Have you ever wondered why big businesses have CFOs (Chief Financial
Officers), Vice Presidents of Finance, CPAs (Certified Public Accountants),
and bookkeepers? It’s because keeping the books is the backbone of a
company’s business.

Keeping Your Books Accurately
When you meet with one of the professionals
discussed in the previous section, they’re going to
expect you to bring a complete and accurate set of
books. To prepare accurate books, you either need
a bookkeeper (who will use accounting software),
or you can learn how to use professional accounting
software yourself.
Do you have a professional going over your books at
least once a year? You really should. A paid profes-
sional experienced in business knows what to do
when it comes to your taxes. Due to the complexity
of the tax code, not just any paid preparer will suf-
fice when it comes to preparing your business taxes.
Here’s a list of possible people who can prepare your
tax returns.

Tax Preparer (or Consultant): This is the person
you visit at the local we-file-for-you tax office. Did
you know that a tax preparer could be anybody?
There is no licensing involved. H&R Block hires
as many as 100,000 seasonal workers as tax pre-
parers each year. Where do these people come
from? I’m sure that some are experts at the tax
code, but the sheer number of tax preparers and
the lack of regulation can make using a we-file-
for-you tax office a risky proposition for business
people who want to minimize their tax liability.
A United States General Accounting Office
report estimated that, in 1998, American citi-
zens overpaid their taxes by $945 million
because they claimed the standard deduction
when it would have been more beneficial to
itemize. Half of those taxpayers used a paid
preparer who clearly was not cognizant of the
full tax law as it applied to the individuals.
Scary, huh?

Volunteer IRS Certified Preparers: The AARP
(American Association of Retired Persons) does
an outstanding job of assembling nearly 32,000
tax preparers to serve the needs of low- to middle-
income taxpayers (special attention going to sen-
iors). Their goal is to maximize legal deductions
and credits, resulting in “tangible economic ben-
efits” for their clients. These volunteers have to
study, take a test, and become certified by the IRS
before they can lend their services to the cause.
In 2003, AARP volunteers served a total of 1.85
million seniors in the United States. My mother
was a retired corporate comptroller, and she vol-
unteered in this program for many years. (She
was disappointed when she made her lowest
score on the IRS test — a 94 percent!) They staff

Don’t be a wussy; you can do this. Lots of people
successfully using bookkeeping software today knew
nothing about bookkeeping before they set up their
own accounts. I’m one of them.
My tutor, helping me every step of the way, was
QuickBooks For Dummies by Stephen Nelson, CPA.
I met Stephen a couple of years ago. He’s just as
funny and smart in person as he writes. I highly
recommend his books to help you with learning 
the program.
I highly recommend QuickBooks from Intuit for your
eBay business accounting because it’s tailored for
business. At the end of each year, I hand my CPA a
copy of my QuickBooks backup, along with the
printed reports he requires. Most professionals use
and accept data from QuickBooks.
When your business gets so busy that you
have no time to post your bookkeeping, you
can always hire a part-time bookkeeper to
come in and do your posting for you.
Using QuickBooks in your eBay business
Aside from the professional reasons to use
QuickBooks, there’s another more basic reason, the
program can give you up-to-the-minute reports
about the status of your eBay business and keep
track of everything in the background — including
payroll and sales tax liability.
Here are a few things (among many others) that I
really like about using QuickBooks to streamline an
online business:

Inventory Reports: As you purchase inventory,
aside from deducting the money from your
checking account and expensing your merchan-
dise account, QuickBooks adds the purchased
merchandise to your inventory. Every time you
sell an item, QuickBooks deducts the item from
your inventory. QuickBooks has many other
reporting features for your inventory and end-of-
year reporting for taxes.
Figure 47-1 shows you a part of an inventory
report that I pulled out of the program today. You
can see how valuable the data is. With a click of
my mouse, I can see how much I have left in stock
and the average number that I’ve sold per week.
• Figure 47-1: A portion of my Inventory Tracking report.

Sales Tax Tracking: Depending on how the pro-
gram is set up (based on your own state sales tax
laws), you can request a report that has all your
taxable and non-taxable sales. The report calcu-
lates the amount of sales tax you owe. You can
print out this report for backup information on
your sales tax payments to your state.

Payroll: Whether you use the online payroll
service to prepare your payroll or input the
deductions yourself, QuickBooks posts the
appropriate withholdings to their own accounts.
When it comes time to pay your employees’ with-
holding taxes, QuickBooks can generate the fed-
eral reporting form (all filled in) for submitting
with your payment.

Sales Reports: QuickBooks gives you a plethora
of reports with which you can analyze your sales
professionally. One of my favorite reports is the
Sales by Item Summary. This report gives you the
information below for every inventoried item
you sell in whatever time period you choose:
 Quantity sold
 Total dollar amount sold

Technique 47: Simplifying Your Bookkeeping
282
In the sidebar below, I show you a procedure I devel-
oped to process my PayPal sales. I’ve run it past sev-
eral accountants and QuickBooks experts, and it’s
gotten rave reviews. I’m sharing it with you because
I want you to be able to run your business smoothly.
Using QuickBooks the “Collier” Way
Rather than posting an invoice in my QuickBooks software
for every customer (for those very few customers who need
formal invoices), I can print them out on demand from
eBay’s Selling Manager; I input my sales into a customer
Sales Receipt as shown in the figure below. Whenever I
make a PayPal deposit into my business checking account,
which is every few days depending on how busy sales are,
I post my sales into QuickBooks. This way, the total of the
Sales Receipt equals the exact amount of my PayPal deposit.
(If you’ve ever tried to reconcile your PayPal deposits with
your sales and your checking account, you know how frus-
trating it can be.)
In my QuickBooks account, PayPal is the customer. It makes
no difference who bought what, it just matters what item is
sold (to deduct from inventory) and for how much (to post
to my financial data).
The program gives you the flexibility to customize forms, so
the figure given here shows my customized sales receipt
for PayPal sales. PayPal is a taxable customer when sales are
made in the State of California, and the appropriate sales
tax is applied automatically. Here are the things I have
added to customize the form.
 Percentage of sales represented by each indi-
vidual item
 The average price the item sold for
 COGS (cost of goods sold) by item
 Average cost of goods sold by total sales
per item
 Gross profit margin in dollar amounts
 Gross profit margin expressed as percentages
Depending on how you post your transactions,
you can analyze your eBay sales, Web site
sales, and/or brick-and-mortar sales individu-
ally or together. You can also select any date
range for your reports.
Posting sales in QuickBooks the easy way
Some online auction management services integrate
with QuickBooks. This integration means that your
individual transactions can be downloaded into the
QuickBooks program, setting a up a new customer
for each of your sales.
Although this process is quick and easy, inputting
each sale as a new customer will cause the size of
the database to become huge quickly. QuickBooks is
a very large program to begin with, and if you’re
going to use it (and update it) for several years, the
database will become even larger.
If you’ve ever worked with large files, you know the
larger the data file, the more chance there is for the
data to become corrupt. That’s the last thing you
want. Besides, QuickBooks will max out with over
14,000 customers — very doable in several years on
eBay.
To keep track of your customers, you can use
an additional copy of your PayPal monthly
report and combine them with cash sales into
an Excel (you can also use Microsoft Works)
spreadsheet to build this important data.

Keeping Your Books Accurately
283

PayPal Fees: I have set up PayPal fees as a credit
against sales. (In the figure, you can see they are
applied as a negative.) This helps to match the total
amount of the Sales Receipt to my PayPal deposit.
It also gives me a discount line in my sales reports
that tracks my total paid PayPal fees. This also appears
in my Costs of Goods Sold area of my financial
statements.
In case you’re wondering about eBay fees, they have
their own line in my chart of Accounts. I charge eBay
fees to my company credit card. When the credit
card expenses are posted, I post the eBay expense
to the eBay fees account which appears in the Costs
of Goods Sold in my financial reports. In my book,
Starting an eBay Business For Dummies, I show you
how to set up QuickBooks for eBay and I include a
suggested chart of expense and income accounts.

State: I type in the two-letter state abbreviation
of the shipping location with each item. This serves
as backup information for my State Board of
Equalization (the California sales tax board) and
also allows me to run reports on what has sold in
which states.

Date: The date at the top of the Sales Receipt is the
posting date. The date in the product posting indi-
cates the date the PayPal payment was posted.

Class: Every item posted in QuickBooks can be part
of a Class to make data easier for you to isolate cer-
tain types of transactions. I have set up two classes
of PayPal sales: California sales and out-of-state sales.
The California sales are classified as Taxable, and the
Out-of-State sales as Non-taxable. QuickBooks calcu-
lates the tax liability automatically.

Tax Classification: When I type the first two letters
into the class area (OU for out of state, and CA for
in-state sales), the tax line changes automatically to
Tax or Non-Tax. QuickBooks would do this whether
I show this field in the Sales Receipt or not, but by
having it appear, it serves as a secondary mental
reminder to post the taxable Class properly.
By inputting my eBay sales data in this way, I streamline the
process in several ways. I post data to only one program
once. From this Sales Receipt, I get updated inventory reports,
accurate Sales Tax data, accurate expense and income track-
ing, and easy reconciling of my checking account.

Technique
Monitoring Your
Financial Reports
A
fter you’re up and running with your eBay business, you can look
forward to having lots of reports to evaluate. Of course, you get a
plethora of reports from PayPal, eBay, and so on, but the most
important reports are those you generate from your bookkeeping pro-
gram (software such as QuickBooks). I use the QuickBooks software
package to manage my business records, and it keeps several common
reports (Balance Sheet, Accounts Payable, P&L, and more) in an easily
assessable area. If you check out the reports tab of your bookkeeping
program, I bet you’ll find similar items. Before your eyes glaze over,
though, check out this technique for straightforward descriptions of
these reports and the information they provide.
Similar sales and financial reports are common to all businesses,
and reviewing them on a monthly basis can help you stay on top of
yours.
To get your business reports when you need them, you must post
your sales receipts regularly and thereby update the money in and
the inventory out. Post your payments out at least weekly (especially
on your company credit card — post those transactions the minute
you get your statement) and reconcile your checkbook the moment
your bank statement arrives.
What do your posting and reconciling tasks get you? The opportunity
to hit a button and get a complete picture of your business. From the
reports you generate, you find out whether your business is profitable,
what products are selling, and if you’re spending too much money in a
particular area. Keeping your books up-to-date allows you to find prob-
lems before they become unmanageable.
If you run your sales and financial reports quarterly rather than
monthly, a problem — such as not pricing your items high enough —
could be mushrooming out of control.

De-bewildering Your
Balance Sheet
Your balance sheet provides the best information on
your business. It pulls data from all the other reports
and gives you a complete look at your business’s
financial condition.
Your balance sheet shows all your assets:

Cash in Bank: The money in your business bank
account.

Accounts Receivable: If you’ve invoiced anyone
and not received payment as yet, that amount
will reflect here.

Inventory Assets: This is the value of the mer-
chandise you have purchased for resale but have
not as yet sold.

Other Assets: Things your business owns (not
you), like furniture and vehicles. These are not
considered in the Current Asset figure.

Accumulated Depreciation: This is deprecation
on your assets, either produced by your account-
ing program or given to you by your accountant.
The balance sheet also (alas) shows your liabilities:

Accounts Payable: If you owe any vendors or
have money due on unpaid credit cards, it will
show up here.

Sales Tax: The money you have collected on
sales tax (that is due to your state) is a liability.

Payroll Liabilities: If you haven’t made a bank
deposit covering the money you’ve withdrawn
from employees (withholding taxes, Social
Security, Medicare, and so on), it will show up
here.
Your equity shows up in the (literal and figurative)
bottom line at the bottom of the statement. It will
include your initial investment in your business and
the net income total from your Profit & Loss
statement.
An important business ratio — the net working
capital ratio — is drawn from your balance
sheet. Subtracting your current liabilities from
your current assets gets you the dollar amount
of your net working capital. But to get the net
working capital ratio, divide your current
assets by your current liabilities. Any value
over 1.1 means that you have a positive net
working capital. If you need a loan from a
bank, this is the first figure the loan office will
look for.
Tracking Your Accounts
Payable
When bills come in, post them in your accounting
program. This will generate the Accounts Payable
report. Accounts payable is the area that shows how
much you owe and when it’s due. These are crucial
dates and numbers to know so you can be sure to
meet your obligations when they’re due.
When you pay an outstanding bill, the bookkeeping
program deducts the money from your checking
account and marks the bill as paid. It will no longer
appear on this report.
Knowing Your Sales
Tax Liability
One of the vendors you’ll owe money to is your state.
In California, it’s the State Board of Equalization.
Every time you post an invoice or sales receipt that
charges sales tax, that amount shows up in this
report. You run this report on a timeframe that’s
determined by the state; you may be required to
report monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Also, how often
you report may depend on your total of in-state

Technique 48: Monitoring Your Financial Reports
286

Costs of Goods Sold (COGS): This area itemizes
by category all the costs involved in your eBay
(and/or Web site sales) only. (None of your busi-
ness operating expenses — such as your tele-
phone bill — show up here; they’re further down
on the report.) Your eBay COGS may subtotal in
different accounts, such as
 Merchandise: The cost of your merchandise
that you bought to resell.
 eBay Fees: Here’s where you post your eBay
fees from your credit card statement.
 PayPal Fees: This figure will automatically
generate from your sales receipts (as
described in Technique 47 on QuickBooks).
 Shipping Postage: The totals of the amounts
you spend for shipping your eBay items.
These also appear here from within your pro-
gram from your inputting the various expenses
when you pay the bills.
 Shipping Supplies: The costs of the padded
mailers, bubble wrap, tapes, and boxes — you
get the picture. When those items are paid for,
the bookkeeping program inserts the totals
here.
 Outside Service Fees: If you pay for your
photo hosting or third-party management
tools, they appear here.
Cross-reference your Costs of Goods sold to
your Sales reports. You’ve expensed inventory
bought — but your merchandise may be sitting
idle in your storage area. The COGS report
works in concert with  others — such as inven-
tory reports (also generated by QuickBooks),
sales reports, and P&Ls — to give you a solid
picture of where your business is going.
Your Costs of Goods sold will subtotal under the
heading Total COGS.

Gross Profit: Your bookkeeping program magi-
cally does all the calculations, and you will be
able to see in a snapshot if your basic eBay busi-
ness is in good, profitable health. This is the
gross profit — before you figure in your company
sales. Just make sure you match your reporting with
your state’s requirements for your business.
Analyzing Your Profit
& Loss Statement
If your accountant asks for your income statement,
she’s asking for your profit-and-loss statement, or
P&L. This report lays out clearly every penny you’ve
spent and brought in. You can set these reports to
generate by any period of time; usually eBay sellers
produce them by calendar month.
A summary P&L (or Profit & Loss Statement) will
itemize all your income and expense accounts indi-
vidually, and total them by category. This way, you’ll
be able to isolate individual areas where you may
notice a problem such as spending too much in the
shipping expenses.
Please use the following list of income and expense
accounts as a guide and not as the gospel. I am not a
tax professional, and I suggest that when you set up
your own income and (especially) expense accounts,
you go over them with a licensed tax expert.
Here’s the glimpse at the kinds of accounts and
categories you see on a P&L statement:

Income: Every dollar you bring in is itemized
as income. For many sellers, this can break down
into several individual accounts. These figures
are automatically generated by your bookkeep-
ing program from the sales receipts you input.
The total of all these income areas appears at
the bottom of this area as Total Income.
 Sales: This totals eBay Sales and Shipping
income in separate totals. These figures
subtotal as Total Sales.
 Web-site advertising: If you are a member of
any affiliate programs or have a newsletter
that takes advertising, this income posts here.
 Consulting: Income from consulting or teach-
ing others.

expenses (often called G&A — for General and
Administrative costs).
Now come your expenses. Listed in individual
accounts, you have subtotals for your various busi-
ness operating expenses, as follows:

Payroll expenses: The total amounts you pay
your employees.

Taxes: Broken out by State and Federal, the taxes
you have paid the regulating agencies for running
your business.

Supplies: Computer and office supplies. How
much paper goes through your printer? Not to
mention those inkjet cartridges, pens, comput-
ers, telephones, copiers, network equipment. All
those expenses appear here.

Seminars and Education: Did you buy this book
to educate yourself on your eBay business? It
counts. Have you attended a seminar to educate
yourself on eBay? Going to eBay Live? Those
count too.

Contract Labor: This is the money you pay to
anyone who is not an employee of your company.
This may include an off-site bookkeeper or a
company that comes in to clean your office. The
federal government has very stringent rules as to
who classifies as an Independent Contractor.
Check this Web site for the official rules:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/
0,,id=115041,00.html

Automobile expenses: This is where you post
expenses — parking, gas, repairs for an automo-
bile that is used for your eBay business. If you
have only one vehicle that you also use for per-
sonal transportation, your tax person may have
you post a percentage of its use in this area.

Telephone: Do you have a separate phone line
for your business alone?

Advertising: Expenses you incur when running
campaigns in Google AdWords or in your eBay
banner program.
Your expenses will come to a whopping total at the
bottom, and then, at the very bottom of the page
will be your net income. This is your bottom-line
profit. I wish you all a very positive bottom line!

Save Time By
 Keeping your company

 Backing up your
computer
 Saving documents safely
Technique
Keeping Your
Records and
Data Safe
I
f the hazard of not backing up your computer isn’t a tired subject, I
don’t know what is. Whenever you hear someone talking about their
latest computer crash, all they can do is stare blankly into the distance
and say, “I lost everything!” I admit, it’s happened to me, and I’m sure
that you’ve at least heard this cry from others (if you’ve not uttered it
yourself): “If only I’d backed up my files!”
Even worse than a computer crash, what about a natural disaster? It can
happen, you know. When I went to sleep on January 16, 1994, I didn’t
know that the next day, when I attempted to enter my office, everything
would be in shambles. My monitors had flown across the room, filing
cabinets turned over, and oh, did I mention the ceiling had collapsed? It
seems that my garage office became Ground Zero for the Northridge
earthquake. (I want you to picture me shoveling though the mess to find
my insurance policies.) This experience taught me some solid lessons
about keeping duplicate records and backed-up data copies in an off-site
location.
If the ultimate computer crash (or natural disaster) has happened to you,
you have my deepest and most sincere sympathy. It’s a horrible thing to
go through.
What’s another horrible thing? A tax audit: It can especially make you
feel like jumping off a cliff if you’ve been filing your hard documenta-
tion with the shoebox method. (You know, one box for 2004, one for
2003, and so on.) Filing your receipts and backup documentation in
an organized, easy-to-find format really can pay off in future savings
of time (and nerves). Even if you’re not going through a tax audit.
I want to tell you upfront that I don’t always practice what I preach. I
don’t always back up my stuff on time. I have a brand new box of backup
software sitting on the floor next to me, and the 2004 box of receipts is
getting fuller. But in this technique, I’m gonna preach anyway about good
practices for backing up your computer data and safeguarding the hard-
copy documents that you inevitably will have. (I just really hope there
are no disasters before I finish writing this book!)

Saving Your Business Records
289
Taking the time to organize and safeguard
your data and records now may save you
days, weeks, or months of work and frustra-
tion later.
Backing Up Your Data —
Just Do It!
I’m not specifically suggesting that you go out and
buy backup software (though I think it’s a good idea).
I am suggesting that you back up the eBay transac-
tion records and other data on your computer some-
how. Consider the following points when choosing
how to back up the data you can’t afford to lose:

Regularly back up at least your My Documents
folder onto a CD. CD burners have come way
down in price (you can find external USB burners
in good condition for under $50 on eBay), so
there’s really no excuse not to make some sort of
backup.

Backup software can make your backup chores
less chorelike. Most such packages have features
you can set to automatically run unattended
backups, and you don’t have to remember
anything.

Backup software doesn’t have to be expensive
either. I just visited one of my favorite shareware
sites, www.tucows.com and searched on the term
backup Windows. This query returned over 300
matching records!
There’s no need for me to recommend a par-
ticular brand of backup software; almost any
brand you buy will do a good job. When you
search Tucows or Amazon, read the customer
comments and let these direct you to the soft-
ware that’s right for you.

Consider making monthly backups of the info
from your PayPal account. You can download the
data directly from the site (see Technique 30)
and can archive several years’ worth on one CD.
Saving Your Business Records
Business records are still mostly paper, and until
such time as the entire world is electronic, you’ll
have some paperwork to store. You can buy manila
file folders almost anywhere. A box of 100 costs you
less than $10, so expense is no excuse for lack of
organization.
If you don’t have filing cabinets, office supply stores
sell collapsible cardboard boxes that are the perfect
size to hold file folders. You can buy 6 of these for
around $8.
And just what do you need to file in your new organ-
ized office? Here are a few important suggestions:

Equipment receipts and warranties: You never
know when some important piece of your office
hardware will go on the fritz, and you’ll need the
receipt and warranty information so you can get
it fixed. Also, the receipts are backup documen-
tation for your bookkeeping program’s data.

Automobile expenses: Gasoline receipts, parking
receipts, repairs: anything and everything to do
with your car. You use your car in your eBay
business (for example, to deliver packages to the
Post Office for shipping), don’t you?

Postal receipts: Little slips of paper that you get
proving mailing from the Post Office. If you use
an online postage service, print out a postage
report once a month and file it in your filing cabi-
nets or boxes as well.

Credit card bills: Here in one location can be
documentation on your purchases for your busi-
ness. Make a folder for each credit card and file
every month after you pay the bill and post the
data.

Merchandise receipts: Merchandise purchased
for resale on eBay. Documentation of all the
money you spend.

Licenses and legal stuff: Important! Keep an
active file of anything legal; you will no doubt

Insurance information: Policies and proposals
should all be kept at hand’s reach.
I’m sure that, with a little thinking, you can come up
with some more things that can benefit from a little
bit of organization. When you need the information
quickly and you can find it without breaking a sweat,
you’ll be glad you kept things organized.

Avoiding Sick Days
by Staying Healthy
I
’ve been in business, working from a home office for many years (more
years than I’d like to admit to here). I’ve learned a few things that I’ve
passed on to you in my books, but one thing I’ve never written about
is the importance of keeping yourself healthy. I want you to think about
this. What happens if you’re too sick to handle your work? What happens
if your hand is so painful from using the mouse that you can’t type or even
use your computer comfortably? Its not a pretty picture — I’ve been there,
believe me. Let’s not even discuss the time I sliced off a part of my finger
using a box knife — and had to bandage it up myself so I could get my
packages out.
When you’re a one-man (or one-woman) show the way I am, covering
all the bases for your business can be difficult even when you’re in the
best of health. Even if you have someone to help you, you’re the hub
of your business. If you run an eBay business as your full-time job
and you’re too sick to do the work, you won’t be making any money.
When I first started in business, I went to the used business furniture store
and bought the cheapest chairs and desks I could get my hands on. These
worked fine for a while but didn’t work too well when I had to pull all-
nighters getting a catalog out for an early deadline. The ill-fitting furni-
ture made my back ache and my wrist hurt, and staring at the computer
made my eyes burn. You get the picture. In this technique, I discuss the
problems associated with an ergonomically challenged working environ-
ment and share solutions that help you prepare to stay healthy.
Keeping Your Eyes Clear
Ever have to rub your eyes after a long session at the computer? Eyes
burn? Vision blurring? Headaches? You may never have heard about
Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) but it’s a condition recognized by the
American Optometric Association and characterized by such symptoms.
Staring at a computer screen non-stop for hours can even cause your
eyes to lose the ability to focus! Here are several things you can do to
help keep your vision in good working order:

 Making an ergonomically
sound office 
 Staying aware of your
vision and posture
 Protecting your health
with ergonomic tools 

Technique 50: Avoiding Sick Days by Staying Healthy
292
I must have sat in 15 chairs, and was really tempted
by the expensive-looking Aeron chair they had as
well. It didn’t only look expensive — it was expen-
sive! The Aeron chair (by Herman Miller) comes in
three sizes, and eBay Aeron sellers post the size
chart (based on height and weight) with their list-
ings. I tried all three and felt like Goldilocks: One was
just right.
Strangely, according to the Herman Miller chart, I
should have taken a different size, but this chair felt
so cozy and comfortable (an office chair? what a
concept!) that I bit the bullet and bought one. I even
talked the store down on the price (if you can
imagine) — it was just like shopping at eBay! 
When you decide to purchase a chair for office
work, go to a store that specializes in that type
of furniture. After you’ve found the chair you
like, write down the manufacturer and the
model number. Tell the store you want to
think about it (which you do) and then go
home and see whether you can find it on eBay
for less. If not, you can always go back to the
store and haggle a little!
Spending several hundred dollars for a chair seemed
like a wild expense. But I’m four years into the chair’s
12-year warranty and couldn’t be happier. Take it
from someone who sits a lot: Get the best chair you
can. Your back will thank you.
Practicing Safe Mousing
I promise not to duplicate the reams of information
easily available regarding Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
Anyone who uses a mouse for any length of time is
going to have problems with his or her mousing
hand.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome happens when the tendons
in your wrists become inflamed and enlarged so they
squish the nerve in your hand. Whoa! Does that ever
hurt! 

Look away from your computer and change
your focal distance every 15 minutes. Look at the
wall or, better yet, out the window.

Remember to blink! That seems very basic, but
often when we’re concentrating, we forget to
blink. That’s the body’s natural way to lubricate
the eye.

Use a drop or two of lubricating or vitamin-
based eyedrops in your eyes to prevent dry eye.
(Bausch & Lomb even makes an eyedrop solely
for computer users.)

Maintain a proper monitor viewing distance of
20-24 inches and locate the monitor slightly
below eye level.

Dust off the screen every few days.

Consider purchasing computer glasses. These
glasses are tinted and have Ultra Violet (UV)
coating to prevent glare from the monitor (and
the florescent light in your office). There are pro-
fessionals who sell these glasses on eBay at very
reasonable prices.

Get up from your computer and walk around
every hour or so. This is not only good for your
eyes, but it keeps your blood moving too!
Watching Your Back
Remember those cheaper-than-cheap used chairs I
told you about? Well, they weren’t such a good idea.
Even though I upgraded to a brand-new budget
chair, I’d still get a crick in my back while working at
the computer for long hours. Do yourself a favor and
don’t make your chair the cost-cutting item in your
office.
I finally broke down, after reading about all those
“ergonomic” chairs with the high prices, and went to
a true office furniture store. Mind you, I didn’t say
“office supply store,” I said “office furniture store.”
Real office furniture stores know all about aching
backs.

Practicing Safe Mousing
293
Since mousing is a way of life for those who make a
living with a computer, there are a few products that
might prevent or solve your problems.

Perfit Mouse: This Contour Design product is an
ergonomically correct mouse. I bought my first
one in 1996, when the pain in my hand was so
great that I couldn’t make a fist. They’ve upgraded
the design, made it even more ergonomic, and
it’s available in both regular and optical styles.
Again, just like Goldilocks, you can get this
mouse to fit your hand as it comes in 8 sizes.
Their Web site, www.contourdesign.com, has
measuring charts and online ordering.

Quill Mouse: This is an interesting mouse that
has worked well for many people. When using
the Quill Mouse, your hand is held vertically ver-
sus flat down. This posture allows you to relax
your hand on the Quill Mouse base, and click
with your fingers in the vertical position. The
Quill Mouse works additionally well with the BIB
“Click-Less” software sold on the site. You can
get all the information at www.quillmouse.com.

RollerMouse: Contour Design strikes again. I had
a particularly bad bout of tennis elbow caused
by mousing to the side (instead of perpendicular
to my body — the proper way) and I didn’t know
where to turn. I tried every ergonomic gadget
and gizmo I could find with no relief. My arm felt
fine if I rested it in my lap. This didn’t work at all
for mousing until I found the RollerMouse. The
RollerMouse is a platform with gel wrist rests
that goes under your keyboard, and your mouse
is a roller mounted on the board, as in Figure
50-1. It helped cure my arm problems, and now
I go back and forth from a Perfit mouse to the
RollerMouse to keep the different muscles from
getting inflamed. 
Its wrist rests are also useful for preventing
Carpal Tunnel. You can find more about it at 
www.contourdesign.com/rollermouse.
• Figure 50-1: A RollerMouse in action.
A few more little things
Think of other places where you have inconveniences in
your office:

Telephone: Did you buy the first phone you found
at the office store? Or did you really research it? A
good-quality telephone that has a good speaker-
phone (and even possibly a headset attachment)
will make your office day go better.

Keyboard platform: You might also find that a key-
board platform is useful. It will position your key-
board lower than your desk, allowing you to keep
your arms in the proper posture.
Speaking of posture. Figure 50-2 shows the proper
posture angles to stay comfortable in the office. No,
she doesn’t have X-ray vision (bad hair, maybe); the
figure illustrates the correct angle for viewing the
monitor.

Technique 50: Avoiding Sick Days by Staying Healthy
294
Let your body talk to you when you’re working (just
hope that nobody’s listening). If you’re uncomfort-
able in any way, do something about it before you
get an injury. That way you can continue to run your
eBay business without sick time and enjoy bringing
in the money!
• Figure 50-2: Proper angles make for proper posture at
the computer.

Overcoming
Accessibility
Challenges
B
efore the online community grew so pervasive (as we know it
today), I bought my first computer-with-a-modem — and though
there weren’t a lot of uses for a modem then, you could buy a soft-
ware package that hooked you up to CIS, the CompuServe Information
Service. There, in some lively, real-time chat rooms, I met people from
cities I’d never been to or even thought I’d visit. But there would soon be
more to it — and that became obvious a few years later, when I started a
business on AOL in a chat room. I ran monthly live auctions (for action
figures, autographs, and other paraphernalia). I’d send invitations to peo-
ple on various online bulletin boards, list the items to be auctioned, and
wait for bids via e-mail. Those came in daily, and daily I’d resend the list
of items with the current bids. The process ended in a chat room with a
live auction where people could bid for each item. (Sometimes those auc-
tions lasted for hours!)
I encountered some fierce competition from people who sold this way,
and I liked to chat online and get to know them. It turned out that my
fiercest — and very successful — competition came from a gentleman
with cerebral palsy. He made many friends online, ran a nice little busi-
ness, and made me realize that the Internet is a great place for the physi-
cally challenged to do business.
Fast-forward to the eBay era: Some of the most amazingly happy people
selling on eBay are those who face limitations within a traditional work-
place. They’ve found a home for their businesses on eBay, where they
can — and do — work as hard and as effectively as anyone. In this
technique, I tell you about the Disabled Online Users Association (DOUA),
an organization that helps its members make the most of the Internet’s
business potential. Also, I introduce some tools designed to help with
computer-related accessibility challenges.
Technique

 Finding income potential

Technique 51: Overcoming Accessibility Challenges
296
The powerful message of the organization — which I
include here — appears on its home page at www.
doua.info: 
The Disabled Online Users Association (DOUA)
was established as a way to bring technology to
the differently-abled by means of one-on-one sup-
port, resources, motivation, and whenever possi-
ble, financial assistance. The core of DOUA
consists of both differently-abled and perfectly-
abled folks who just want to “give something
back” and/or to assist those with disabilities that
would otherwise be considered shut-ins or that
live at or below the poverty level. Our main
focus is to assist people in becoming financially
independent — a hand up, not a handout.
This is where eBay comes into the picture. It IS
all about a level playing field and that’s what
eBay provides for us. We can work our own
hours, at our own pace, as much or as little as
we like. No one ever needs to know that we are
differently-abled. The majority of us WANT to
work — NEED to work — and LOVE to work. It’s
just that we don’t fit into the “mainstream” and
sometimes employers are afraid to hire us.
The DOUA runs a Mentor program, where eBay
members who meet the qualifications — they must
be legally disabled and can’t have listed more than
five auctions — can receive the following:

Five products to list on eBay 

A diskette containing digital photos of the items

Available support from an assigned mentor via
telephone and e-mail
How amazing is that? Members of the DOUA come
from all walks of life and all sorts of disabilities (for
example, Marjie told me about an eBay seller who
was blind). If you know some folks who can benefit
from the DOUA, point them to the Web site
www.doua.info.
By the way, the DOUA does take donations.
Into a wider world on eBay
My favorite eBay PowerSeller is 78 years old and proud of
it. He runs about 30 auctions a week, buys a little as well,
and really enjoys his daily trip to the Post Office to drop off
his packages. He’s vibrant and happy — and makes a nice
little income on eBay!
There’s also bobal (Bob Bull), whom I met at eBay Live
when he received a Community Service award from eBay
CEO Meg Whitman. Bob is wheelchair-bound with MS,
but always manages to find time to help other people. eBay
was a turning point for Bob. He had become despondent
due to his illness, and then he and his wife discovered trad-
ing on eBay. They bought, they sold — but most of all, they
made friends. He’s an active participant in the Images/
HTML Chat Board and the Photos/HTML Discussion
Board. He answers any questions when he’s online — and
he’s been kind enough to teach me a few things. You can
read his story on his Web site at www.bulls2.com/index/
bobal/mylife.html.
These are just two stories out of hundreds I’ve heard. Not
only can the stay-at-home mom make a living on eBay, but
so can seniors and the disabled. They just occasionally need
a little help.
Helping Others through DOUA
I have to tell you about one of my favorite ladies. I
met her in the lobby at eBay Live in 2003, and her
name is Marjie Smith. Marjie is confined to a wheel-
chair due to surgical complications. She’s also a
PowerSeller and runs a successful business on eBay
(user ID is abovethemall), as well as on her own Web
site. She’s one amazing lady.
She is the founder of the Disabled Online Users
Association (DOUA) — a network of disabled mem-
bers interested in using the Internet to supplement
their income.
“Our goal at DOUA is to help the differently-abled
become self-sufficient and independent,” says Marjie
in her role as Founder of DOUA and moderator of the
DOUA Message Board. “If you’re disabled and would
like to start your own online business, we can help.”

Setting Up Windows for
Easier Accessibility
When someone is operating with a disability, simple
things like using a computer can be a challenge.
Many companies are inventing tools to help people
with online access, and these tools help eBay sellers
with disabilities to become independent.
If you use Microsoft Windows, you can take advan-
tage of Accessibility options that are built right into
the Windows interface. Using the Accessibility
Wizard, as pictured in Figure 51-1, you can enable
several options.
• Figure 51-1: Using the Accessibility Wizard to set the
computer’s text size.
For example, visually impaired users can set
Windows to display a larger, easier-to-read interface
by following either of the next two sets of steps.
Use the Microsoft Magnifier (which you start
by choosing Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪
Accessibility➪Magnifier) to read small type in
Web pages or other documents. The Magnifier
splits your desktop into two windows, one of
which displays whatever your mouse is point-
ing to at magnifications levels from 1x to 9x.
Setting accessibility options with the mouse
Follow (or, as needed, have a helper follow) these
steps to set up the Windows Accessibility options
via mouse clicks:
1.
Click the Windows Start button.
A pop-up menu appears.
2.
Choose Programs➪Accessories➪Accessibility➪
Accessibility Wizard.
The Accessibility Wizard’s Welcome window
appears.
3.
In the Welcome window, click Next.
4.
Select the smallest text you can comfortably
read in the display, and then click Next.
5.
For Display Settings, be sure the Change Font
Size box is checked; if it isn’t, click it. If you
want to use Microsoft Magnifier, check its box.
Go to the next page by pressing N.
6.
Place the mouse pointer in the box labeled I
am blind or have difficulty seeing things on
screen. Then click Next.
7.
Click Finish to save your changes (or, if you
want to cancel your selections, click No). To
move back to an earlier step in the Wizard,
click Back.
Setting accessibility options with the keyboard
Follow (or, as needed, have a helper follow) these
steps to set up the Windows accessibility options via
the keyboard:
1.
Press the key with the Windows logo (or press
Ctrl+Esc), press R, type accwiz, and press the
Enter key.
The Accessibility Wizard’s Welcome window
appears.
2.
In the Welcome window, press N.
In these steps, pressing N does the same thing as
clicking Next: It moves you to the next screen.

Finding Tools to Meet
the Challenge
I also asked Marjie if there were any special tools
that DOUA members use. She suggested the ones in
this list.

JAWS: This software program, designed to be
used with a speech synthesizer, is a screen
reader for the vision-impaired or blind. Here’s
where to get it:
www.nanopac.com/JAWS.htm

ZoomText: Screen magnifier for the visually
impaired. It supports high resolution in windows
and will magnify the screen 2x to 8x in steps of
one, 10x to 16x in steps of two. The program
enlists edge smoothing to eliminate jagged edges
of magnified text. For more info, go to
www.nanopac.com/zoomtext.htm

HeadMouse: Head-controlled computer access.
A tiny sensor placed on the forehead replaces a
standard mouse and keyboard. It translates
movements of the user’s head into movements of
a mouse pointer. It can be combined with soft-
ware that produces an on-screen keyboard for
typing. Here’s the Web site:
www.orin.com/access/headmouse

Sip/Puff Switch: This is an over-the-ear device
that is controlled by sipping and/or puffing. It
can be used in concert with the HeadMouse. For
more information, check out the Web site
www.orin.com/access/sip_puff/index.htm
Marjie also recommends the RollerMouse (also
noted in Technique 50). This tool works well for
those with limited hand or arm functionality.
3.
Use the Up or Down Arrow keys to select the
smallest text you can read, and then press N.
4.
If the Change Font Size check box is not
selected, press C; if you want to use Microsoft
Magnifier, press U; to move to the next page,
press N.
5.
Press L to select the box labeled I am blind or
have difficulty seeing things on screen. Then
press N to continue.
6.
Press Enter to save your changes and exit, or,
to cancel your changes, press the Tab key to
move to the No button and then press Enter. To
move backward in the Wizard, press B.
Windows has other Accessibility options, which are
available through the Control Panel. Choose Start➪
Settings➪Control Panel and double-click Accessibility
Options. Here are just a few of the options you’ll find:

StickyKeys: If you have difficulty pressing two
keys at once, this program will help. (This is
especially helpful if you have RSI — repetitive
strain injury.) StickyKeys lets you use the Shift,
Ctrl, and Alt or Windows logo key by pressing
one key at a time. You can activate the program
by pressing your Shift key 5 times and clicking
Settings to set it up.

MouseKeys: With MouseKeys, you can use the
Num Lock calculator part of your keyboard to
mimic your mouse. You can move the mouse
pointer to any place on the screen by using the
arrow keys; single-, right-, or double-click; and
drag and drop items just as you can with your
mouse.

On-Screen Keyboard: On-Screen Keyboard dis-
plays a virtual keyboard on the screen that
allows people with mobility impairments to type
data by using a pointing device or joystick.

Building Business
Buying Plans
T
here are so many types of business models that sellers use on
eBay. Some sellers are constantly on the prowl for new products
and stock their merchandise as soon as they find a deal. Others fol-
low the trends and try immediately to get stock of the latest and greatest
gizmo that’s hopefully going to sweep the country (and eBay). Plenty of
sellers run their business by selling for others, and constantly beat the
pavement for new customers to serve. Then there’s the new eBay e-tailer.
The eBay e-tailer buys merchandise to sell on eBay. E-tailers are always
looking for new wholesalers, but the e-tailers usually specialize in a par-
ticular type of stock item, such as dolls, sports cards, lighting fixtures, or
apparel. Their eBay business is organized; they sell their merchandise
and then buy more to replenish their stock. But is this the best way to
handle things? It definitely works for most sellers, but those who actually
went to school and studied retailing know there’s a better way.
One of the first things you learn when studying retail buying is the use of
a six-month merchandise plan. It’s the ultimate tool in the arsenal of a
successful retail buyer. Although it was originally designed for brick-and-
mortar retailers, I’ve adapted it here for eBay e-tailers.
Although filling out the plan may not seem like a timesaving technique,
after you fill it out, you’ll be able to combine it with the reports gener-
ated by your bookkeeping program (I explain proper bookkeeping in
Technique 47) to get a clear, concise picture of your eBay business. This
is a business and not a guessing game, and handling your business in a
professional manner will save you a great deal of time and money.
Understanding the Six-Month
Merchandise Plan
Business means not running by the seat of your pants. I admit that run-
ning by the seat of your pants is fun and exciting, but it’s really not a
solid business practice. One of the reasons I started my own business is
Technique
Save Time By
 Getting your sales data
together
 Evaluating your six-month
merchandise plan

Technique 52: Building Business Buying Plans
302
To put together your six-month plan, you need to
have sales history for a six-month period. To get a
good historical picture of your sales, it’s beneficial
to have an entire year’s worth of figures.
Your six-month plan can be based on your
total eBay sales, or only one segment of your
business. For example, if you sell musical
instruments, along with many other sundry
items, but you want to evaluate solely your
musical-instrument sales, you can use just
those figures for a six-month plan for your
“music” department. 
What you’re going to establish is your inventory
turnover. You’ll measure how much inventory sells
out in a specified period of time. The faster you
“turn over” merchandise, the sooner you can bring
in new merchandise and increase your bottom line.
You can also evaluate whether you need to lower
your starting price to move out stale inventory to
get cash to buy new inventory.
When you prepare your six-month plan (an example
is provided in Table 52-1), set out the months not by
the regular calendar, but by a retail calendar, which
divides the year into the seasons of Fall/Winter
(August 1 through January 31) and Spring/Summer
(February 1 through July 31). This way, if you want
to refer to top national performance figures in trade
publications or on the Internet, you must base your
figures on the same standardized retail seasons.
Formulas That Calculate
Your Data
Okay, I can admit that bigger minds than mine came
up with these standard formulas. Magically, they
work and are used by retailers around the world. If
you’re not pulling the figures from a bookkeeping
program, here’s how you make the calculations.
You can make your calculations in dollar amounts or
number of units of the item. In order to figure out
how much of this item to buy, you must know how
much you have left in stock.
that an unorganized business format appealed to
me. To my dismay, I soon learned that organiza-
tion and planning really did make a difference in my
bottom line.
Anyone who has participated in management in a
corporation knows about the annual “plan.” Every
year, at every business, management gets together
(with Ouija and dart boards) to project sales,
expenses, and profits for the coming year. From this
annual exercise, the “budget” for the coming year
arises. These are the magic numbers that form
everyone’s annual raises — along with the com-
pany’s plans for growth.
So, assuming that eBay sellers are online retailers,
retail evaluation could help eBay sellers make sound
business decisions. Making a merchandise plan is a
good step in that direction. A merchandise plan cov-
ers six months at a time and sets sales goals. It also
helps estimate how much money must be spent on
merchandise (and when) so that a particular sea-
son’s success can be replicated and magnified.
Getting the Data
There are a few numbers that you need to get your
plan on paper. You should be able to get these num-
bers from your bookkeeping software programs
Inventory Valuation report:

BOM: The value, in dollars, of your beginning-of-
month inventory

EOM: The dollar amount of your end-of-month
inventory

Gross sales: Total revenue from sales (not
including shipping and handling)

Markdowns: Total revenue of merchandise you
have sold at eBay below your target price
The EOM figure for a specific month is the
same as the BOM figure for the following
month. Example: The End Of Month figure for
April is the same as the Beginning Of Month
figure for May.

303
Formulas That Calculate Your Data

EOM Stock = BOM Stock + Purchases – Sales

BOM Stock = EOM Stock from the previous
month

Sales + EOM – BOM = Monthly Planned
Purchases
Prepare a chart for your own business, similar to the
one shown in Table 52-1. Study your results and find
out which months are your strongest. Let the table
tell you when you might have to boost your mer-
chandise selection in lagging months to boost sales.
It will help bring your planning from Ouija board to
reality.

Technique
Knowing Your
Customers
W
hen you’re in business, you can’t consider yourself only a
retailer; you have to be a marketer, too. eBay enables sellers in
the United States to market across a massive geographic area.
I’m sure you know how large the area is, but what about the people you
sell to? You’ve heard of advertising being targeted to the lucrative 18-to-
49 age demographic, but what about all the other age groups? Who are
they? If you learn about your customer, you’ll know how to sell to them.
It’s all about targeting.
Decide who buys what you want to sell, or better yet, decide with whom
you want to deal. If you don’t want to deal with e-mails from teenage
gamers, perhaps you shouldn’t be selling items that Gen N (in the upcom-
ing description) is gonna want.
Marketers often provide blanket definitions about the population based
on their stage in life, what they are “expected” to buy, and which activi-
ties they participate in. From your eBay sales, you may find giant holes in
this theory, but since everything has to have a “standard,” this technique
defines the demographic groups, classified by age.
Marketing to the Generations
The marketing generations are not formed truly by biological dates. It’s
more about their life experiences and what influenced people as they
were growing up. We all know that outside influences make a big differ-
ence in how we look at things — and that affects how and why we buy
things.
World War II Generation: (Or as Tom Brokaw defined it, the Greatest
Generation). This is the segment of our population from the mid-70s to 90
or so. They’ve lived through the Great Depression and known about sacri-
fice. They don’t like waste, purchase items in smaller quantities, and like
using single-serving products.
World War II colored their lives, giving them the perspective to work
together against a common enemy. The WWII generation is generally

Marketing to the Generations
305
more team-oriented than other generational groups.
Sadly, this group is not strongly targeted by mar-
keters. Many people in this age group are visiting
eBay looking for merchandise, and some smart eBay
sellers market to them.
It’s a wide-open area. Just look at the success of sell-
ers selling glasses for the visually impaired, vita-
mins, and medical devices. With the growth of the
Internet, many of these people are also having fun
unloading their lifelong collections of “stuff” on eBay.
Post-War Generation: The largest percentage of the
U.S. population, this group is aged from their mid-
fifties to mid-seventies. This is an underestimated
and strong market — the only people who don’t
underestimate their strength is the AARP (American
Association for Retired Persons). Visit the AARP Web
site if you think this age group is fading away at
www.aarp.org. By using a little intuition, you can
study this site and get a good picture of what this
age group is interested in. The site suggests a wide
swath of merchandise to sell.
This group has experienced the Korean War, the Civil
Rights movement, and the Cold War. They moved to
the suburbs with their parents, and lived through
the birth of rock ’n’ roll. Yes, they may be grandpar-
ents too, and that opens an entire new area of mar-
keting. Don’t you think they’re shopping big-time for
little ones too? Marketers know this, and many direct
toy marketers target catalogs to grandparents buy-
ing for kids.
According to the 2000 Census, the median age
in the United States is getting older, at 35.3
years, up from 32.9 in 1990.
The Baby Boomers and the Leading-Edge Boomers:
This is the second-largest segment of the U.S. popu-
lation. It’s also about time that marketers quit trying
to sell them Depends, and concentrate on what
they’re really doing. They’re still working 12-hour
days, are into fitness and nutrition, running
marathons, running businesses, and having lots of
fun buying all the latest techie toys.
Aged from the mid-forties to fifties, these folks are a
significant segment of the population. They’ve been
in the work marketplace for many years and are
spending big money in the market today. They grew
up thinking anything was possible (they saw the
first man walk on the moon), but events dulled the
optimism of their youth: the Vietnam War, Cuban
Missile Crisis, and the assassinations of John F.
Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.
Grow your eBay business by marketing to the
boomers. Earn money selling health and well-
ness products. They’ve got disposable savings
to spend on technology, fashion, and travel.
Talk about the market for cosmetics and age-
staving potions! This group also has fun with
eBay Motors!
Trailing-Edge Boomers: From the mid-thirties to late
forties, this group is not the well-promoted Baby
Boomers and not quite Gen Xers. Even though tech-
nically they are the same generation as the Baby
Boomers, their life experience makes them feel
they’re in a different generation.
They don’t really care about Elvis, didn’t want to be
hippies, and didn’t serve in Vietnam. They’re the
first wave of Reagan-era MBAs who’ve had their chil-
dren and are busily starting to spend on them.
They’re more cynical — feeling cheated by the Baby
Boomers (who already had all the good jobs). They
view themselves as the “best” generation.
Trailing-Edge Boomers entered their adulthood with
pessimism; they were the first to enter the workforce
with a lack of confidence. They also look for ways to
work from home (they’re the telecommuters) —
think of all the things you can sell them to enhance
their lives!
Gen Xers: Generation X is another difficult-to-pin-
down era. The phrase “Generation X” was coined by
Douglas Coupland in his 1991 novel, Generation X:
Tales for an Accelerated Culture. (It was also the
name of a group in the 1970s featuring Billy Idol.)
The phrase was picked up by marketers looking to
name the newest upcoming group. But who is

Technique 53: Knowing Your Customers
306
They have money, and if it’s hip, they want it.
Generation N: This group grew up without giving
technology a second thought. They’re naturally
adept and have been comfortable with technology
ever since they could press the buttons on a
keyboard.
Dubbed “Generation Net,” they’re too young to have
established themselves in the marketplace. They will
be the force in the coming decades. They’re from
widely diverse ethnic groups and seem to be more
social-cause–oriented than their predecessors. Only
time will tell where their interests will go. The 2000
Census counted the total population under 19 as
80,473,265 — 28.6 percent of the population.
Table 53-1 below gives you the actual population fig-
ures of the United States. With this knowledge, you
can better decide just how many people will be
shoppers for your products in the future. The figures
in the 2000 Census pegged the country at a total
population of 281,421,906 — 49.1 percent male and
50.9 percent female.

Generation X? It’s a hotly debated issue. Some say
the Xers were born as early as 1961, but a more
accepted dateline places them in the 1965-to-1975
timeframe, when birthrates were at a new low.
Generation Xers were brought up on television and
personal computers. They saw the adults around
them go through incredibly selfish times, which is
something they do not want to repeat. Growing up in
the “me” generation, they now see that it was not all
that it was cracked up to be. However, they’re very
concerned with financial and emotional security.
This makes them aggressive entrepreneurs, espe-
cially because they are very street-smart. They think
of themselves as being “different” and are concerned
with dropping the pretenses of the Baby-Boomer-
dominated world.
Gen Y: The largest consumer market since the Baby
Boomers grew up with the Internet. They’re the 65
million Americans born between 1977 and 1995. The
term was coined in 1993, by Advertising Age, the
influential magazine for advertising, marketing and
media professionals — so they’re truly children of
the advertising era.
During the ’90s, their parents worked extra hard to
strike a balance between work and family after the
workaholic ’80s.
Generation Y comprises the children of the
Boomers — sometimes called Echo Boomers. Some
sociologists even go as far as to suggest that they
are attempted clones of the Boomer generation.
Influenced by their parents, they value education.
They’ve worked several part-time jobs and already
know what they want from their careers once they
reach the marketplace.
To Gen Y, technology is a fait accompli. They’re
aware of every up-and-coming trend and are the first
to embrace (or kill) it. The spontaneity of the Internet
keeps them ahead of the marketers — knowing
almost before the marketers do what their favorite
stars wear. Manufacturers are now giving free clothing
to stars on VH1 and MTV to stay at the forefront of
the market.

Marketing Your
eBay Listings
S
elling is all about marketing, and marketing is all about promotion.
eBay provides you with some awesome tools to promote your items.
Face it; if you sell more, you make more money — and so does eBay.
It’s to their benefit to help you become a retailing mogul on the site.
eBay isn’t naïve either — they know that if they make it easy for you to
drive sales to eBay, you’ll be less likely to spend tons of time on your
own retail Web site. Many successful eBay sellers sell hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars a year in merchandise — exclusively from sales on the
eBay site. The tools are easy to use, and not all eBay sellers know how
to use them or where to find them. When you’re finished with this tech-
nique, you’ll be a savvy seller, upping your sales through eBay cross-
promotions.
eBay Cross-Promotions
One of the slickest promotional tools to date is the cross-promotion.
Every time you view an item for sale on eBay, you will see a filmstrip fea-
turing four other items currently up for sale by the seller, as shown in
Figure 54-1.

radio button.
Now, you’re ready to create your default Display
Settings further down the page.
The next step along the way to cross-promotion
nirvana deals with choosing the default merchandis-
ing settings to use when a user views one of your
items. In an area similar to the one shown in Figure
54-2, you have to decide on several things, including
these:

Selling Format: This is where you decide which
types of items you’d like to show with other types
of items. You can also select Show Any Item.

Gallery Items: Select in which order you’d like
your items with gallery pictures to appear.

Item Sort: Select how you want to display your
items: Ending Soonest, Ending Last, Newly
Listed, Highest Price, or Lowest Price.
• Figure 54-2: Your choices for item display in cross-
promotions.
After making your choices, you next select the set-
tings for when someone bids on or wins one of your
items. These options are the same as the ones listed
above for viewing.
Another filmstrip with four items will be presented
after you bid on an item or make a purchase from
the seller. If the seller is smart and has an eBay
Store, he’ll have preselected the items you’ll
see when viewing or bidding on an item.
Smart cross-promoting
Cross-promoting can work to the nth degree for you if
you think about what buyers want. If you’re selling a
man’s size Large shirt and you have ties or similar
shirts in the same size, why not list those items in
the cross-promotions area? Promoting a jackhammer
along with the search, on the other hand, may be a bit
more of a stretch. And you might be slipping farther
from reality if you chose to promote an eye makeup
kit along with the man’s shirt. Get it? Promote items
that relate to each other, and catch the prospective
buyer’s eye.
In Figure 54-1, the items pictured appeared in a list-
ing cross-promotion from my other book, Starting an
eBay Business For Dummies. I felt if someone is inter-
ested in starting a business on eBay, they might be
interested in buying some tools to make their selling
easier.
You can also change your promotions if you have a
hot item that appeals to everyone. You can switch
that item into one of the boxes by visiting the cross-
promotions area.
Setting up cross-promotions
The first step toward cross-promotional bliss is to
agree that you want to use the eBay cross-promotion
tool. Follow these steps:
1.
Go to your My eBay Preferences page, scroll to
the bottom to the heading Personal Information,
and click the Participate in eBay Merchandising

the selections above.
Checking the status of your cross-promotions
If you’re not using Selling Manager, you will have a
link on the top of your Items I’m Selling page that
reads Cross-Promotions. Click there, and you’ll be
taken to your cross-promotions status area, as shown
in Figure 54-3.
• Figure 54-3: My eBay Items I’m Selling cross-promotions
status area. 
eBay uses three icons to communicate the status of
the promotions for your items:

Green check mark with a blue circle: Cross-
promotions have been automatically selected for
you by eBay based on your preferences.

Green check mark: This refers to items you’ve
selected individually for cross-promotions and
that are still active on the page. (Meaning that
none of your cross-promotions have expired,
causing the system to substitute another for you.)

Yellow shield with an exclamation point: This
means that one of the items you previously man-
ually set up needs attention. One of the manually
selected cross-promotion items has ended and
has been automatically replaced within the
parameters of your default settings.
If you use Selling Manager, you’ll have an alert area
on your Summary page as shown in Figure 54-4.

eventually notice that you need to make some
adjustments. To edit your cross-promotions, follow
these steps:
1.

You see an area similar to Figure 54-6. On the top
of the page are the items currently being shown
when someone views an item, and on the bottom
of the page are the items the bidder views when
they bid on or win the item.

If you don’t want to set up a separate Web site for
your items for sale, eBay has a super alternative

and just has pictures of the baby or your dog, people
will stop by — why not show off your eBay listings!

Using Google to
Build Your Business
O
riginally, this technique was to tell you all about Google AdWords,
a fantastic Web-based promotion product. But as I learned more
about the service, I found that Google itself is way more than a
mere search engine. Google can help you find data, keep abreast of mar-
keting trends, make you laugh, and give you more information than you
ever thought possible. The best part about it is that it’s pure. You’re not
barraged with pop-up ads on every page.
What Google means is information: marketing information about your
customers for you and information about your eBay Store for your cus-
tomers. In this technique, I show you how to make Google your silent
eBay marketing partner. Google works for you while you’re busy with
your sales. Also check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book; it
lists even more short tricks that you can accomplish with the Google
toolbar.
Finding Out What the Zeitgeist Is
It’s all about the zeitgeist. And what the heck, you may wonder, is a zeit-
geist? The term comes from the German (originally Geist der Zeit ) words
“Zeit” meaning time and “Geist” meaning spirit. It’s the all-embracing
intellectual atmosphere of a distinct time period. In today’s terms? It’s
the buzz.
Similar to the Yahoo! Buzz mentioned in Technique 8, the Google Zeitgeist
feature keeps current and historic data on the site. It’s based on the total
number of queries on a particular subject in a succinct period of time. It’s
updated on a weekly, monthly, and — when called for — on a daily basis,
and can be found at www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html.

The roots of Google
The word Google is a malformation of googol, a word
coined by mathematician Edward Kasner signifying a num-
ber of immense proportions — a one followed by 100 zeros.
It’s a number that signifies near-infinity. That’s where Google
got its name. The company was originated to make sense of
the seemingly infinite amount of information on the Internet.
The company was founded (as you can imagine) by a cou-
ple of brainy guys. Larry Page and Sergy Brin met in grad-
uate school at Stanford (majoring in Computer Science,
what else?). Then and now they are a pair of uniquely bril-
liant guys. Larry even once built a working, programmable
plotter and inkjet printer out of Lego™! 
Google was born from their first enterprise, BackRub, an ever-
growing network of low-end PCs (they couldn’t afford big-
time servers). Its goal was to provide a “back-link” to data on
the Internet so that students could more easily find data. In
1998 they founded Google in a rented house, honing their
technology with a terabyte (a thousand billion bytes or a thou-
sand gigabytes) of storage on miscellaneous disks purchased
at discount. (If they would have had eBay they probably could
have saved even more — but who could even conceive of a
terabyte in 1998? These guys, I guess.) They shopped their
new project to big-time money men and silicon valley big
wigs to no avail. Yahoo! founder, David Filo, told them to call
back when it’s fully developed. Others just blew them off
inconsequentially. Their angel came in the form of Andy
Bechtolsheim, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems. After
seeing an abbreviated version of the guys’ demo (being a
leader of industry, he had places to go and people to see), he
did see potential in the product and said, “why don’t I just give
you $100,000?” He made the check out to Google, Inc. 
internationally); in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Australia, and Japan. This page also links to histori-
cal Zeitgeist data.
The Zeitgeist page is where you can get the nuggets
of thought for your marketing and selling plans.
Figure 55-1 shows data from the week ending
March 8, 2004.
• Figure 55-1: Top 10 Queries week ending March 8, 2004.
If you come to this page and see this data, you can
know for sure that it’s time to start selling old Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia stock certificates, bro-
chures of vintage Ford vehicles, and Tony Soprano 
T-shirts. It also tells me to start gathering up all the
free John Kerry campaign memorabilia that I can get
my hands on for future selling. I also know its time to
pack up any Oscar stuff I have to sell and wait to put
it up next year!
The Zeitgeist also has information for previous peri-
ods. If you take a look at Figure 55-2, you’ll find some
obvious data (hindsight is 20/20). If you were selling
items based on any of the popular queries or brands
in 2003, it’s fair to say you did very well.
Check out the Zeitgeist. It could be your crystal ball

Catching Attention for Your eBay Store on Google
315
Oops, there was no Google, Inc. The check had to hang
around in a desk drawer for a couple of weeks before they
got a corporation together. (See why I tell you to plan
ahead? You never know when someone will drop $100K in
your lap!) From their small start with a staff of three, Google
now reigns supreme in the Zeitgeist (read on) of the com-
puter era, operating with 1,000 employees from their offices
at GooglePlex. 
Today, the average Google search takes about a half sec-
ond, driven by 10,000 interconnected computers. It can be
searched in 46 different languages and is considered the
#1 B2B Web site and #5 in any medium: online or off.
Although I’ll be teaching you a taste of Google in this
technique, I highly recommend Google For Dummies by
Brad Hill. It’ll give you even more insight to this amazing
enterprise.
Catching Attention for Your
eBay Store on Google
Have you ever Googled (that’s part of the new ver-
nacular, a new verb meaning to search the Google
engine for something) your eBay Store? I did; I
searched the name of my store and included the
word eBay in the search parameters. Figure 55-3
shows you the results. Google your store; is it listed? 
• Figure 55-3: Wow! My eBay Store is listed!
If it isn’t, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity
for free promotion. Google runs “spiders” (just pic-
ture the way a spider runs — swiftly and all over the
place), automated robots that scour the Internet on
a monthly basis looking for data to become part of
the Google index. The robot is named Googlebot.
Thousands of sites (and you do know that since
your eBay Store has a unique URL, it’s considered
to be a Web site) are added to the Google index
every time their spiders crawl the Web. If, for
some unknown reason, your eBay Store isn’t listed,
go to www.google.com/addurl.html, as pictured in
Figure 55-4.
• Figure 55-4: Get your free shot at the big time.
When you get to this page, type in your eBay Store
URL. Just click on the store red tag icon next to your
eBay user ID to get to your store. Copy and paste the
URL in the address line of your browser into the URL
line on the form. When I went to my eBay Store, I got
the URL, http://stores.ebay.com/Marsha-Colliers-
Fabulous-Finds. (That’s the URL you should use in
your email and printed propaganda to promote your
store.)

Technique 55: Using Google to Build Your Business

Once you’re there, you can go over the details and
set up your own campaign.
For your campaign, there are a few things to keep in
mind.

Keywords and Keyword phrases: Come up with
a list of keywords that would best describe your
merchandise. Google allows you to estimate,
based on current search data, how often your
selected keyword will come up every day. They
will also estimate your daily cost based on the
current amount of clicks on that word. That can
be a shocking number. Don’t worry, not everyone
who sees your ad will click on it — but if they
did, eeyow!

CPC (Cost Per Click): You determine how much
you’ll pay for each click on your keywords. You
can pay as little as $.05 or as much as $50 a click.
The dollar amount you place on your clicks
makes the basis for how often your ad appears.

CTR (Click Through Rate): This is a statistic that
reflects how many people click on your ad when
they see it. If your CTR falls below .5 percent
after 1,000 impressions, AdWords may slow, or
even discontinue, your ad views. When one of
your keywords isn’t passing muster, it will be
indicated on your reports as Moderate or less.
Without showing my keywords, Figure 55-6
shows you a month’s worth of keyword analysis
for my account. You can see clearly that some
keywords are doing their jobs and others aren’t.
To keep my account current, I evaluate my CTR
every month and delete the laggers.

Daily Budget: You can set the cap in dollars on
how much you’ll spend a day. Going back to the
theory that if you have some really hot key-
words, you could spend thousands on clicks!
Setting up your AdWords account will take a while
and some thinking. So wait until your mind is clear
(Saturday morning?) and sit down at the AdWords
site with a cup of coffee and expect to take a while.
In the second line, add a comment if you wish,
describing your store merchandise and click Submit.
There are no guarantees here, but odds are you’ll
find your little shop up on Google within a few weeks.

with AdWords
Being a regular user of the Google index, I began
to notice small ads in the right-hand side of my
searches under a headline called Sponsored Links. I
definitely figured they were expensive links from
high-dollar operations until I found out the truth. If
you take a look at the results of a Google search in
Figure 55-5, you’ll see my little ad on the right.
• Figure 55-5: OK, I Googled myself.
People use Google more than 200 million times a
day. Google AdWords allow you to create these prof-
itable little ads. You choose keywords to let Google
know where to place your ads. Certainly you can
come up with some relevant keywords to promote
your eBay Store! (If you’re stumped, try the 30-day
free trial of Sellathon mentioned in Technique 14.)
The coolest part of the deal is that you only have to
pay for the ad when someone clicks on it (very much
like eBay Banners talked about in Technique 57).

• Figure 55-6: AdWords Keyword statistics.
Google gives you excellent step-by-step instructions
once you’ve signed in at www.adwords.com. This is the
general process you will follow.
1.
Decide if you want to target your ads
geographically.
You can pinpoint your market if you’d like, or
you can blast the entire world. Choose from a
list of 14 languages, 250 countries, or as far down
as 200 United States regions.
2.
Create your ad.
This is not as easy as I thought! You can only cre-
ate three lines of ad text with a total of 95 charac-
ters. Be as concise as possible. Don’t throw in
useless adjectives. Figure out the perfect 95 char-
acters that will sell your site to the world. (I told
you that this might not be an easy task.) You must
also supply your Web site or eBay Store URL.
3.
Select your keywords.
Write out your keywords and key phrases in the
box provided. You can use Google’s Keyword
Suggestion tool to help you out. Since this is
your initial pass and won’t be etched in granite,
take some wild stabs and see what happens.
4.
Choose you maximum CPC (cost-per-click) and
then press Calculate Estimates.
Here’s where the sticker shock gets you. The data
in front of you will let you know which keywords
you can afford to keep and which ones must be
discarded. If you want to change your CPC
amount, do so and press Recalculate Estimates.
The Traffic Estimator calculates how much, on
average, you’ll end up spending in a day.
5.
Specify your daily budget.
There will be a prefilled in amount that would
ensure your ad stays on top and gets full expo-
sure every day. No Mr. Google, I do not want to
spend $50 a day on my keywords. Set a cap on
your budget and Google will never exceed it. You
may make it as low as you wish, there’s no mini-
mum spending amount.
6.
Enter your e-mail address and agree to terms.
After you verify your e-mail address, you can put
in your billing information and you’ll be minutes
away from your ads going live on the Google
index.
Interestingly, your ads may also appear on other
places on the Internet through Google’s Webmaster’s
program. Take a look at Figure 55-7; my ad ended up
on my book’s listing page on Amazon since one of
my key phrases is eBay For Dummies (and my target-
ing is considered relevant).

W
hen it comes to high-dollar transactions on eBay, in the past the
only thing a seller could do to provide security for the buyer
was to throw in an escrow. Escrow is a great way to protect the
buyer, but it ties up the seller’s money for considerably longer than nec-
essary. The best legitimate company currently for escrow on eBay is
escrow.com.
Lately, there have been many scandals in the online escrow arena.
Fraudsters have put up bogus Web sites, offered expensive items for sale
online, and then run the escrow through their bogus site. The buyer,
thinking everything to be legit, sends their money. After the money
arrives, however, the Web site is taken down and the bad guys make off
with the loot.
There’s even a Web site called www.sos4auctions.com. They have a data-
base of fraudulent escrow Web sites and a discussion area where people
discuss and report ongoing frauds. Escrow has gotten a bad reputation
with buyers. As a matter of fact, the issue is so serious that if you go to
the escrow.com Web site area (at https://escrow.com/fic/), you’ll find a
very helpful zone about how to recognize escrow fraud.
There’s finally a viable alternative to escrow, something that will make
the customer feel good about spending buckets of money on your site:
Bonding. It’s all about potato chips, beer, and Monday Night Football. No,
wait, that’s male bonding. The bonding I’m talking about here refers to
guaranteeing that a seller will perform as advertised.
Bonding isn’t just for high-dollar transactions, either. Originally I was
thinking this was good just for expensive items, but not so! I’ve heard
from small-time sellers that their total number of bids and their final sell-
ing price increased by one-third after bonding all their items with the
buySAFE seal (even the $5 sales!).

Learning About Bonding
I’m sure you’ve heard about bonding. In ads on TV
maybe you’ve heard that a contractor is “licensed
and bonded.” On large projects in the entertainment
or graphic design business, the person doing the job
might be bonded to guarantee that the job will be
completed on time. A bond warrants that the person
(or business) performing the task will complete their
part of the deal as contracted.
A bond is not insurance. Insurance assumes
that a loss is a possibility. When there is a
bond, it guarantees that a buyer will not suffer
a financial loss.
There’s a new company, buySAFE, (an eBay certified
developer), who has come up with a traditional
bonding plan exclusively for eBay sellers. buySAFE
procures surety bonds through The Hartford
Financial Services Group (they’ve been around for
193 years and are one of America’s largest financial
services provider) to bond eBay sellers’ transactions.
The bond provides that The Hartford will refund the
item sale price or replace the item in the event the
seller does not perform as promised in the item listing. 
The bond can protect buyers when:

The bonded seller fails to deliver the item.

The seller delivers an item different from the one
described and pictured in the item listing.

The seller offers a return or refund policy but
refuses to honor it.

The seller fails to use the shipping method as
described in the item listing and the item arrives
damaged (as when the buyer pays for insurance
but the seller fails to insure the package).

The seller refuses to follow the payment policy
described in the item listing.

The seller experiences financial setbacks and
does not fulfill the conditions of the sale.
A bond basically guarantees that the seller will
perform, period. Bonding your auctions tells your
prospective bidders that you care about the buyer,
and that you’re a professional seller. This assurance
easily can translate into more bids and higher final
selling prices.
The best part? The seller receives their money
through regular channels and doesn’t have to ship
the item until paid. No waiting around for weeks to
get your money, because, as is the case with an
escrow, you’re at the mercy of the system.
When one of your items is bonded, it displays a seal
(as shown in Figure 56-1). If the prospective buyer
clicks on it, they will see the details of what the seal
represents.
• Figure 56-1: This item is bonded!
Seller Bonding on eBay
You may be wondering if it’s some sort of big deal to
get your items bonded on eBay. Not really. Here’s
how it works.
Your auctions can get bonded up to a total maximum
of a prescribed dollar amount. The total amount of
bonded auctions cannot exceed this figure. Think of
the maximum like a line of credit, you can only draw
against it until you’ve maxed out your line.
To become bonded, you must meet at least some
minimum requirements:

98 percent positive eBay feedback

Your eBay business is based in the United States
(but not in the state of Hawaii)
If you fulfill those requirements, you then need to fill
out a form on the buySAFE Web site, which will ask
you information about yourself and your business.
After applying, you undergo a thorough qualifica-
tion process, which evaluates your online sales
experience and reputation; verifies your identity;
and analyzes your financial stability. Then you must
also legally commit to either honoring their terms of
sale or repaying any losses that they cause.
Yes, you may have great feedback, but bond-
ing is not about the people who are already
buying from you — the point is to attract new
buyers with a signal that proves you’re profes-
sional and rock solid.
Bonding items
After you receive approval and know your total
bonding amount (based on how you were qualified),
you may choose which of your auctions to bond and
which not to bond.
The auctions you choose to bond cost you 1 percent
of the final selling price. You pay nothing in advance,
and there’s no hidden fees or commitments. You also
don’t have to pay if a bonded item doesn’t sell. With
this plan there’s no minimum fee either. If the bonded
item sells for $3 (shipping, handling fees, and taxes
are not included in the bonded total) your fee will
be $.03.
Take a look at Figure 56-2 to see a sample Bonded
Seller’s Log In page at buySAFE. Here, at a glance,
you can see any of your items that aren’t yet bonded
as well as your total bonding limit, bonds outstand-
ing (bonds on a sold item are kept open for 30 days),
and the total of your bonded transactions.

• Figure 56-4: Details of an open auction.
What happens when something goes wrong?
When a buyer feels slighted in a transaction, that
customer is still yours to solve the problem with. If
unhappy buyers contact buySAFE, they will be sent
directly back to you.
If, for some reason, they still insist they need help
resolving the issue, they may fill in a Problem
Transaction report on the buySAFE Web site, stating
the problem and saying what the seller can do to
resolve the issue. This will appear on your Seller
Services page; you will see a red button that reads
View Problem, indicating a problem. By clicking the
button, you’ll come to the Problem Summary page
(as shown in Figure 56-5).
You can see the buyer’s comments when you click
the Problem bar, as shown in Figure 56-5.
• Figure 56-5: See the status of a transaction’s problem.
An e-mail is sent to you, and your response is
recorded. If, after two e-mail exchanges pass, noth-
ing has been solved, a professional mediator (a
claims representative) joins in to solve the problem.
There is no charge for the mediation. The mediator
may contact both the buyer and seller via phone to
get both sides of the story. A bond from a surety
company, such as The Hartford, has a legal obliga-
tion to protect both parties. It protects the seller from
false allegations and the buyer from losing their
money.
If no compromise is made, the mediator will make a
binding decision, based on the evidence provided, in
favor of one party or the other.
The Hartford is regulated by each state’s Insurance
Department and is held accountable by them for
adequately investigating each claim. Bonding is the
only licensed and regulated form of seller guarantee.
Bonding, as I have said, may be new to eBay, but it’s
proved successful with many of the sellers who have
tried it. If you’d like to give it a whirl, go to www.

Technique
Flying Your Banner
on eBay
S
itting on your hands doing nothing is no way to increase business,
but checking out every available opportunity is. While browsing on
eBay, I noticed banner ads at the top of the Search pages. What sur-
prised me most was that the banners did not always advertise some huge,
mega-corporation like Home and Garden TV, Toyota, or Stanley Tools —
but instead, they highlighted little guys with eBay stores like mine!
Just as I assumed that these banner ads were reserved for the high and
mighty, I also assumed that they must be very expensive. But they’re
quite reasonable and easily within the eBay seller’s budget! Remember
this is “advertising.” It’s something the big guy will never go without.
So eBay opened the floodgates for eBay sellers to promote their items to
eBay buyers right on the site.
These banners, just as with Google AdWords, are based on keyword
searches, and link to your eBay store (or to particular items in your
store). The name of the game here is click-throughs. How many people can
you get to click your banner and buy your goods? Read this technique
and find out how easy it is to become a “big guy” with your banner flying
on eBay.
Getting the Click-Throughs
Probably close to a hundred million people use eBay’s search engine
every day — and hope the search terms they use help them find the goods
they want. When you have listings in the same genre that the search
terms describe, your items get matched with the search. But even better,
you can direct searchers to your listings by paying eBay to display your
advertising banner at the top of the matching search page.
This magic is performed with keywords — the same keywords that I 
discuss in Technique 14. This type of advertising works out financially only
if you’re selling several items that fall under the same group of keywords.
For example, suppose you have several related items with keywords such
as For Dummies. Your ad is served to the eBay page in response to search

Making Your Banner
323
terms such as eBay Timesaving Techniques For
Dummies that match your keywords or keyword
phrases.
eBay’s adMarketplace (which controls the banner
ads) is a cost-per-click network, just as is Google
AdWords (see Technique 55). But placing a banner ad
for eBay keyword advertising isn’t as expensive as
you might think:

You pay nothing for the banner to appear.
Remember, you pay only if your ad gets clicked.

You control how much you pay for a banner
chick-through by placing a bid on the amount
you want to pay.
Here’s the trick to keyword advertising. Those
who bid the highest tend to have their ads pri-
oritized first. So the higher your bid for the ad,
the higher you’re ranked in the ad rotation for
the specified keywords. This means that your
banner ad will potentially appear on the search
results page more often than will the ad for
your competitor who bid less.
Bidding for placement starts at $.10, and increases
by increments of 1 cent. In the section, “Setting Up
Your Banner Campaign,” I show you how the bidding
works.
Making Your Banner
So that you don’t put the cart before the horse, it’s
best to decide what you would like your banner to
say to potential buyers.
If you’re spending time and money on a ban-
ner ad, make sure you target a specific item.
A general banner relaying only the message
“Shop from Me” isn’t going to get you a lot of
clicks. A specific banner telling readers that
you offer “The Wildest Widgets on the Web”
has a better chance of getting a little mouse
action. The whole idea of the campaign is to
get people to click your banner and thereby
find your sales.
On a sheet of paper, write down all the words you
can think of that relate to your item. Also, do you
have an image you’d like in the banner? Pull together
all the resources you have so you can decide on
your banner’s look as well. With everything assem-
bled, you can start reviewing the options for creat-
ing your banner.
Making your own
eBay’s keyword advertising program has a simple
online tool for creating banners, and I’m sure you’ve
seen the resulting banners on eBay. They all look
much the same and thereby lack a polished, profes-
sional image. If you’re trying to develop your own
“brand” and be in business for real, you need to
create a custom banner.
If you’re one of those creative sorts and have some
extra time, you can easily create your own custom
banner. (For some people, designing a banner would
be a relaxing time!) There are plenty of graphics pro-
grams that will do the trick.
If you’re looking for a graphics program to try
your hand at banner making, consider Corel
R.A.V.E. This program is very reasonably
priced, and you can get a super deal on eBay.
Finding someone to make it
When you don’t have the time or inclination to sit
down and design your own banner, getting a custom
banner designed for you needn’t be an expensive
proposition.
Plenty of sharp graphic designers sell custom
designed banners on eBay. These designers work
from the information you assembled and produce a
banner within a few days, so it’s not long before you
can start your campaign.
All you have to do is search the eBay site (see the
upcoming search term list) and take a look at the
designers’ listings. See which artist creates the type
of banners you like. Be sure you’re happy with his or

your program starts, you’ll be able to see which
searches net you the most hits. Write down all
possible keywords that might possibly relate to your
item; you’re allowed a long list. Later in the section
(“Targeting with keywords and phrases”), I show you
how to narrow it down.
Keep to these guidelines when making up your list:

Use “key phrases” versus keywords. Key
phrases can be made up of two or three words,
like “Craftsman hammer” or “eBay For
Dummies.” By using multiple word key phrases,
your banner ad can achieve a closer match to
the prospective buyer’s search.

Be sure the keywords relate to your item.

Avoid overused and over-general keywords.
eBay will reject your keywords if you choose to
use the ever-popular title words; Wow, Cool,
Super, Nice, or New.

Don’t use apostrophes, special characters or
repeated periods.
Signing up
To get moving with your campaign, click the Service

Animation: No aggressive animation. It should
not be excessively fast, long, or strobe-like.
(These traits make for an annoying, unproduc-


Maximum file size: 12 KB.

Border: Must be non-white.

Banner text: Must be relevant to what you’re
selling. No keyword spamming! Banner text also
may not contain phone numbers, URLs or e-mail
information.

Campaign
When you go to set up your campaign, be prepared
with some keywords. The keywords you use for your

nary keyword list can be more hit and miss. After

Each time a user clicks your banner, the bid
amount is deducted from your campaign fund.
When the campaign money runs out, you’ll receive
an e-mail notifying you that you need to add funds.
You may also choose an auto-renew option, but
that can easily get away from you. If you’re like me,
you like to know how much you’re spending and
want to control when things are charged to your
account.
If a particular budget gets used up too quickly,
consider waiting a week or so before infusing more
money. That is, of course, unless your sales are
going through the roof, and then the expenditure
is well worth the cost.
I can honestly say that several keyword campaigns
that I’ve used (and am using) have successfully
worked to increase my sales.
Uploading your banner
Uploading your banner is the easiest part of this
long process. When you arrive at the screen that
specifies the banner size, follow these steps:
1.
Click the Browse button to find the GIF file
that is your banner on your computer’s hard
drive.
2.
Click the file, and your banner appears in the
box on the screen.
3.
Click the Proceed to banner upload link.
Your banner is uploaded to the Keywords server.
Now all you have to do is view your campaign sum-
mary. When you’re done, your keywords will be
marked with a red Pending approval. Don’t have a
cow; this usually takes less than a day to be cleared.
If the keywords are not approved for any reason,
you’ll receive an e-mail explaining why.
When you’re finished typing, click Submit. Your
keywords are uploaded and reviewed for “editorial
correctness.” Click OK when you see the confirma-
tion screen and continue to a fully populated key-
word page.
Bidding for exposure
Next, you decide the maximum cost per click (CPC)
that you want to pay. After you click Proceed to
Search Word Analysis — exciting, isn’t it? Wow, real
analysis! — you can enter your maximum bid and
review the potential effectiveness.
For each keyword, you also see teeny tiny versions
of your competition’s banners for that particular
keyword, and you see how much they bid. You may
adjust your bids individually for each keyword.
The higher bid amount gets viewing priority,
so if a keyword is especially important to you,
you might want to up your bid.  Just remem-
ber to click Calculate Ranking to evaluate
your changes at each step.
You don’t always have to be in the number
one (highest bidder) slot. I’m ranked number
3 for one of my keywords. It’s a very popular
one, and my little banner still gets close to
15,000 views per month. Remember that a zil-
lion people are browsing eBay. You’re charged
only when they click your banner. Holding the
number one for all your keywords, that will
burn up your budget in a hurry!
Bidding is handled as with eBay auctions, on a proxy
basis. Even if you select $.20 as your high bid, eBay
keywords will increase your bid by only enough to
put you $.01 ahead of the competition.
You will not always be paying the maximum
you bid per click — just enough to outbid the
competition. eBay Keywords will let you know
about your ranking as you indicate your bid.

Paying for your campaign
Paying for your banner ad campaign is also easy. If
you’ve entered a promotion code, you have nothing
to pay. But when you have to ante up, eBay accepts
all credit cards as well as PayPal.
I recommend you use the credit card you have set
aside for your eBay business. The charge will clearly
show up on your credit card bill as eBay Keywords
advertising. If you allow eBay to debit your PayPal
account instead, there’s a chance it can cause prob-
lems with keeping track of your accounting. (See
Techniques 47 and 48 for more about keeping your
accounting records intact.)

Co-oping with 
eBay to Lower
Advertising Costs
W
hen you consider placing advertising for your business, budget
is always an issue. This is the case whether you’re in a brick-
and-mortar store, on your own Web site, or selling on eBay.
When I was in the advertising business, one of the biggest challenges we
had was convincing a startup to spend money on advertising. It’s simple
arithmetic; you spend money on advertising, and it attracts more people
to your store. When you’ve got a prospective customer’s attention, it’s
up to you to close the sale.
The ace-in-the-hole for any retailer is co-op advertising, which puts adver-
tising dollars contributed by a manufacturer (or other interested party)
into the company’s advertising campaign. The manufacturer benefits by
getting its name out to potential buyers, and the retailer attracts more
buyers (and ideally increases sales revenue) by more vigorously adver-
tising the manufacturer’s product.
Many manufacturers have co-op advertising programs available based on
the dollar amount that the retailer purchases from them. Even if you buy
your merchandise for eBay sales from a wholesaler instead of the manu-
facturer, you may still be able to share some of the co-op funds available
to your wholesaler. Just ask — the worst you’ll hear is “No,” and maybe
your wholesaler will say “Absolutely!”
Because sharing the advertising costs is such a good idea, I wrote this
technique to tell you how to co-op with eBay. And once you have the co-
op advertising dollars, where do you spend them? Almost any traditional
media will do, but in the case of eBay, print media is the target. You can
get co-op advertising dollars if you advertise in your local newspapers,
magazines, catalogs, specialty collectors’ publications, or any publica-
tion with a circulation figure of 10,000 or more. As a coin collector, I’ve
noticed several eBay co-op ads in my monthly coin magazine, and I’ve
seen these ads in other publications, too. Sound like a good deal? In this
technique, I give you some hints on finding the right places for advertis-
ing your business.

Getting In on the Gold
329
Getting In on the Gold
What could be better than advertising your business
and having someone else help pay for it? To get your
little mitts on some of eBay’s co-op cash stash, you
must qualify by being one of the following:

An eBay PowerSeller who operates an eBay
store: This is almost a given. If you’re a
PowerSeller, you no doubt already have an eBay
store.

An eBay PowerSeller who is a registered
Trading Assistant: Again, if you’re a PowerSeller,
I don’t doubt that you’ve sold items for others in
the past. If you’re not a registered Trading
Assistant, check Technique 43 for more info.
I think you’ve noticed the constant in this list. You
have to be a PowerSeller to qualify for the co-op 
dollars. And if you think about it — this requirement
makes sense. eBay would logically choose to put this
kind of investment into those sellers with experience
selling on the site and with a high GMS (Gross
Merchandise Sales). For qualifications and direction
on becoming a PowerSeller, see Technique 42.
How much will eBay pay?
eBay will pay up to 25 percent of your advertising
bill as long as your ad has been approved before
printing. You can get an extra discount through
some publications, which smartly court eBay
PowerSeller advertising. These publications are
members of eBay’s Preferred Publisher Program.
Table 58-1 gives you a current list.
These discounts are in addition to your 25-percent
eBay reimbursement. In some cases you can save
50 percent off the price of an ad. To check to see
if more publications have joined eBay’s Preferred
Publisher program, visit www.ebaycoopadvertising.
com/preferredpublisher.aspx.
When approaching any publication for adver-
tising, don’t forget to ask for a discount.
Discounts are available to many people for
many reasons, and perhaps you can tailor your
ad (a certain size or theme) to get the deal.
Maybe you’ll get one, maybe you won’t. Just
be sure to ask. 
eBay gives sellers a budget, and that budget is
based on your PowerSeller level (which is based
on your GMS). The budget renews ever calendar
quarter, and you can only spend to the limit
assigned to your level within one quarter. Amounts
that are not used cannot be carried over to the next
quarter. Table 58-2 shows you the reimbursement
budgets.

Advertising Basics: Choosing
Where to Run Your Ad
Here’s another reason why I say, “Know what you
sell.” If you’re selling collectible coins, you know
which trade (or special interest) publications you
like to read. Why don’t you give those a shot first?
If you’re not really sure, or perhaps you’d like to see
what other publications are available, go over to
Google and search the words magazine, publication,
and news along with the keyword that describes the
items you sell.
When you go to your chosen publication’s Web site,
check it out: Find the link that goes to the advertis-
ing department and read the information.
Planning an ad campaign should be done
several months in advance of when you’d like
the ads to appear. Many publications have a
long lead-time between booking and final
publishing.
Following are a few more tips about advertising your
business that you can take to heart:

Preview the publication: If you’ve never seen
the publication before, e-mail (or call the 800
number) and ask for a sample along with the rate
card. They’ll be more than willing to send you a
back issue!
After you get a copy of the magazine, newspaper,
or whatever, take a hard look at it and answer
these questions: Would people that read this
publication be likely to shop at your eBay store?

PowerSeller Level
Maximum Quarterly Reimbursement
Bronze
$500
Silver
$800
Gold
$1,200

$3,000
Titanium
$8,000
How do you get your money?
Claims for reimbursement may be submitted to eBay
at any time during the time your ad runs, but must
be received no later than 60 days after the initial
insertion date.
As long as your claim is qualified (you have to get it
approved before you run the ad), you’ll be paid via
PayPal within 45 days of eBay’s receipt of your claim.
By now I’ll bet you’re convinced that this is a good
deal, and if you’re qualified, why not sign up now?
To get your piece of the pie, here’s the condensed
version of the procedure:
1.
Go to www.ebaycoopadvertising.com and click
the key to Register.
2.
After you’ve registered, click the link for the
Ad Creation Wizard to get your template set up.
3.
Upload your ad for pre-approval. When it’s
approved you will receive a Pre-Approval
Authorization Number.
4.
Run your ad.
5.
Once the ad appears, go to www.ebaycoop
advertising.com/Common/ReimbursementForm.pdf
and print out the reimbursement form.
6.
Put the following documentation into one
envelope:
 Your completed reimbursement form
 A full tearsheet from the publication running
your ad (the entire page, not just a cut-out of
your ad)

Creating Your Ad
331
Do you like the magazine? Does it fit your percep-
tion of your customers’ lifestyles? Do the adver-
tisers seem legitimate?

Check out the ad rates: With publications, cheap
doesn’t always mean best. Figure out what your
cost per thousand readers will be and keep that
in mind. When the ad runs, use your eBay statis-
tics (more about getting stats from eBay in
Technique 14) to see how much of an increase
you get in visitors.

Consider running your ad more than once: A
one-time ad rarely pulls enough to pay for itself. A
consistent advertising campaign of repeated ads
(even every other issue) will get the attention of
the publication’s readership and build confidence
in you and increase visits to your store. A consis-
tent campaign works much better than scattered
ads here and there with no direction.

Start out small with a single publication: That
will make it easier for you to track the success of
your campaign.
eBay maintains a list of qualified newspapers and
magazines. It’s a rather long and ever-changing
list, so go to www.ebaycoopadvertising.com/
QualifiedPublisher.aspx for the most up-to-date
list.
Creating Your Ad
Because these ads have to be approved by eBay, it
might behoove you to follow the distinctive guide-
lines. There are rules as to which logos you can use,
as well as in what size and color they can appear.
If you choose to use eBay’s online Ad Creation
Wizard, it has templates in different sizes — as well as
themed templates for eBay Stores or Trading
Assistants.
Figure 58-1 shows an ad I’ve started designing with
the Ad Creation Wizard. You can select from
different typefaces, sizes, and colors for each area
of your ad.
• Figure 58-1: Designing an ad in the Wizard.
The only problem I have with the wizard is that it’s
not very flexible. For example, it doesn’t allow you
to vary your type size within an area, and you can’t
make bulleted lists or italics. Still, the wizard works
quickly, and within a few minutes, I put together the
ad in Figure 58-2.
But since business is business, if you have the
talent, you should take some time and download the
templates and logos from the Download Assets area
and create an ad that suits your style. 
When designing your own ad, remember: The
eBay portion must occupy at least 1⁄8 of the
overall ad size to be eligible for reimbursement.

Technique 58: Co-oping with eBay to Lower Advertising Costs
332
To be sure that your ad will qualify for reimburse-
ment under the co-op advertising plan, be sure to
upload an electronic copy of it through the My Ads
area. After you upload it, you simply click the Submit
button to submit the ad for approval. Along with
your ad approval, you receive your Pre-Approval
Authorization Number. The length of time for which
this number is active depends on the ad itself:

If you design your ad with eBay’s Ad Creation
Wizard, you can continue to use the same Pre-
Approval Authorization Number until eBay
redesigns the templates. When a template
redesign happens, eBay lets you know by e-mail.

If you design the ad yourself, the number expires
within 90 days. After that, you need to resubmit
the ad and get a new Pre-Approval Authorization
Number.
All your approved ads will be held (with details of
approval) in an area called My Pre-Approvals on the
www.ebaycoopadvertising.com site.

Ad Creation Wizard ad.

The Scary (or Fun) Stuff

Raising Money for
Your Favorite
Charity
O
ne of my favorite places to shop on eBay is the Charity area.
Charities as small as the local pet rescue and as large as the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society run auctions for super items to
raise money for their good works.
When charities receive donations of merchandise rather than cash, the
merchandise is called gifts-in-kind. Many manufacturers donate excess
inventory to charities for a full-value tax deduction. The charity can
either use the merchandise in their charitable works or sell the items to
raise money. (You mean you’ve never shopped at the Salvation Army
store?) In the past, charities had to rent retail locations to turn their gifts-
in-kind into cash. Now they’ve got eBay; and eBay supplies the Giving
Works area for all qualified charities.
All groups that run auctions in the eBay Charity area are registered
charities. When you have a hankering for unique items, consider buy-
ing them from the charity auctions on eBay where your money will
do good.
This technique tells you not only how to shop the charity auctions, but
also how to take advantage of eBay’s programs for your favorite charity.
Also, you find out about the opportunities for individual sellers to partici-
pate in the fund raising by donating proceeds from their own auctions to
qualified charities on eBay.
Finding Out About Giving Works
Are you involved in a charitable organization that you’d like to raise money
for? If you think your organization is too small, think again. Perhaps you
just want to sell an item to benefit your favorite charity; you can do that,
too. If you’re a larger charity and you don’t think you have enough people
to handle the sales — eBay has a program that can help you!

Technique 59: Raising Money for Your Favorite Charity
336
• Figure 59-1: The eBay Giving Works hub page.
To browse all items being sold to benefit nonprofits,
click the link View All Giving Works Items. There will
also be nonprofit items listed in eBay store, so to view
them click the link View All Giving Works Store Items.
You may also search Giving Works items with the
search box on the top of the page — although I find
that browsing charity auctions is more fun — you
just might find something you didn’t even know you
needed!
When you arrive at the item page, above the item
description, you’ll find the MissionFish information
box, similar to the one shown in Figure 59-2, which
indicates what percent of the auction proceeds are
donated and the name of the receiving charity.
• Figure 59-2: Charitable information on the item page.
The formal Giving Works area was launched in
November, 2003, and within the first month had
signed up over 2000 nonprofits. eBay ran charity
auctions prior to the launching of Giving Works, but
these auctions were mostly for high profile organiza-
tions with an IRS 501 (c) (3) designation.
eBay Giving Works is now open to any IRS-approved
nonprofit. This could include your high school band
booster club, local volunteer fire fighters, or cat res-
cue organization.
Fishing for donations
eBay has partnered with MissionFish, an organization based
in Washington, D.C., that has been raising money through
online auctions since 2000. They’re a forward-thinking, great
group of people who founded this company with the pur-
pose of doing good for others. Now, MissionFish is a serv-
ice of the Points of Light Foundation and operates their Web
site at www.missionfish.org.
MissionFish operates as the hub for nonprofits selling on
eBay. They qualify the nonprofits, by verifying their eligibil-
ity before they can begin to raise money online with eBay.
Aside from verification they also provide other service and
support activities including donation collection and dis-
bursement, tax receipting, and online contribution tracking.
Starting Small and Buying
Suppose you enjoy visiting eBay and would like to
buy items from a charity. (I do this all the time.) Your
first stop should be the eBay Home page where you
scroll down past the long list of categories to the
Charity link at the bottom. Click this link and you
arrive at the Giving Works hub page shown in Figure
59-1. Should things (like link names or locations)
change at eBay (and they often do), you can always
access the eBay nonprofit area directly at 
www.ebay.com/givingworks

Getting Your Nonprofit on the List
337
Also on the Giving Works page you find a postage
stamp icon of featured charitable auctions. These
icons generally signal major promotions for a partic-
ular nonprofit, with many auctions running at once.
Raising Money for 
the Little Guy
If you’re currently an eBay seller, and you’d like to
sell some items to benefit a nonprofit, eBay will do
most of the work for you. You must select a non-
profit from the directory (shown in Figure 59-3) and
you can contribute from 10 percent to 100 percent of
the final bid at the end of the auction.
• Figure 59-3: The Nonprofit directory. 
After an item is sold, it’s your job to collect the
money from the buyer and to ship the item. You’ll
receive an e-mail confirming the dollar amount of the
final sales price and the percentage that you agreed
to donate. After you verify these figures, MissionFish
charges your credit card for that amount.
MissionFish sends your donation to the nonprofit,
and you receive a receipt for your contribution.
To participate in the program, you must register at
MissionFish. Go to the Web site at 
www.missionfish.org
and click the Seller Registration link.
1.
Type your eBay User ID and password and click
Continue.
After MissionFish confirms that you are regis-
tered at eBay, you proceed to the next page (a
SLL secure connection), which is populated with
your mailing address from eBay’s records.
2.
Check over your information and correct it if
necessary.
3.
Type your credit card information.
This information is used to send the money to
your selected nonprofit when your auction is over.
4.
Create a MissionFish user ID and password for
accessing your information at MissionFish. ( I
used my eBay User ID.)
Now you’re ready to sell. See if your chosen non-
profit is listed in the directory, by typing in their
name — or keywords relating to the charity. You can
also find a nonprofit by browsing through the alpha-
betic directory.
Select your nonprofit and then listing your item is
the same as listing any other item on eBay — only
this time you’ll have a Giving Works gold and blue
ribbon next to your item title (indicating to the eBay
community that your auction is for a nonprofit).
Getting Your Nonprofit 
on the List
If you are involved in a small organization that’s not
listed in the Giving Works directory, it’s easy for you
to become listed. And after your organization
appears in the directory, any eBay member can
select it to receive auction proceeds.
Whenever an eBay member chooses your non-
profit for an auction, you have the opportunity
to accept or decline the beneficial listing.

Planning a big auction?
If you’re with a charitable organization and you’d like to
plan a really big auction, you may not want to handle all the
details yourself. You want to get the highest prices for your
items, and when the bidding gets into the thousands per
item, getting help from someone who knows the ropes can
really help.
Kompolt & Company, an auction management agency
founded by two marketing wizards, Jenny Kompolt and
Melissa James, runs some of the top auctions on eBay for
nonprofits. They’ve run charitable auctions for The Today
Show, The Grammys, Lifetime Television, British Airways,
Bon Jovi and Britney Spears (just to drop a few names).
Their client list is a who’s who in the giving community.
From the MissionFish home page, click the For Non
Profits link. From there you may register your organi-
zation to participate. You must have a few things
ready, including a fax machine to get the required
documentation to MissionFish:

Contact Information (in case they need to call
you).

The nonprofit’s Federal Employees Number (EIN).

A copy of the logo in GIF or JPG format, with a
maximum size of 50KB.

Your prepared Mission Statement in about 40
words (512 characters maximum).

A copy of your nonprofit status letter.

A voided organization check with authorized
signature (to verify your banking information
for deposits).

Web site information. If you have a Web site,
supply the URL, so that a link can be made from
beneficial eBay listings to your Web site.

Acceptance setting. You’ll have to indicate
what’s best for you:
 Accept all, don’t notify me. This means that
anytime anyone selects you as a benefiting
nonprofit, the item will go up for sale on eBay
without prior authorization from you. You will
still be able to view all items you are benefit-
ing from in your my MissionFish account.
 Notify me, one-day auto accept. You’ll be
notified by e-mail every time someone wants
to list an item for you. If you don’t approve or
disapprove within one business day, the list-
ing will go live automatically.
 Notify me, one-day auto decline. You’ll
receive an e-mail notifying you of someone’s
intent. If you don’t approve or decline within
one business day, the item will be declined
automatically.

Getting Your Nonprofit on the List
339
They handle everything for the charity including: registra-
tion, pricing strategies, photography, custom design of the
listing pages (as well as the About Me page), bidder pre-
qualification (payment assurance and protection against
bogus or fraudulent bidding), payment collection and item
fulfillment, and full closing reports and analysis. 
Check out their Web site at www.kompolt.com.
There are no additional fees when a nonprofit
sells direct (other than eBay listing and Final
Value Fees). But when an eBay seller sells on
behalf of a non-profit, there is a $3.00
MissionFish transaction fee and a 2.9% (of the
donation) credit card fee. The seller also has to
pay eBay standard fees.

Save Time By

Auction
Management Tools
W
hen you get to the point of running 20 or so auctions a week, I
highly recommend that you begin to use a management tool. At
this level of activity, using eBay’s Selling Manager will suit you
nicely, and I go over how Selling Manager works in Technique 12. But
when your eBay business begins to push 60 or 70 listings a week, I even
more highly recommend that you get some additional help in the form of
an auction management service or software.
Whether you use an online service or software based on your own
computer is a personal decision. You may find it easier to use an
online system because you can log on to your selling information at
any time from any computer. But if you have a slow Internet connec-
tion or pay usage fees by the hour, managing your eBay business
online can become impractical.
Most desktop-based software packages have features that enable you to
do your work on your desktop computer and then upload (or download)
your data when you go online. If having multiple locations to work from
is not important and you run your eBay business from a single computer
in your office, you may feel more comfortable with a desktop-based
software product.
In either case, if your business has reached the level where you need an
auction management tool, congratulations! With this technique, I want to
save you some time finding the service or software that’s right for you.
I’ll outline some of the specific tasks that you can expect an auction man-
agement product to provide. At the end, I include two tables that com-
pare pricing on various services.
Choosing Your Auction Management Tools
There’s a huge difference between auction listing software and sites and
auction management products. For a small to medium seller (approxi-
mately 20 to 60ish listings per week), listing software like eBay’s Turbo
Lister (see Technique 11) may just do the trick. Combine that with eBay’s
60
Technique

Looking for the Essential Features
341
Selling Manager (a management program) and your
eBay business will be humming along just fine.
When your business activity level increases and you
turn to an auction management solution for your
eBay business, there are certain standard features
that you should look for when you evaluate software
and services. Also consider what information man-
agement features you currently have through your
bookkeeping program (see Technique 48). You have
the data there, regardless of whether you use it in a
management solution.
Because many of the products listed have several
product pricing tiers, Table 60-1 gives you the link
directly to the product’s pricing page. I’ve also listed
the minimum price for each company’s management
products. Some offer less expensive options for list-
ing your auctions (with templates and all kinds of
swell bells and whistles), but the price shown in the
table is for the minimum management product.
Never choose auction management tools
based solely on price. Go to the various Web
sites and take a look at everything they offer
for the price stated. You may find out that a
service charging a bit more may just be worth
it because of all the extra tools offered.
Looking for the Essential Features
Here are some of the must-have features to look for
when you evaluate the offerings of auction manage-
ment services and products:

Image hosting: Some Web sites dazzle you with
high-megabyte storage numbers. Keep one thing
in mind. If your average eBay image is around
40KB (that’s kilobytes, not megabytes — see
Technique 15 for more on the details of eBay
images) then in a 5 MB storage space you could
store 128 pictures. In a 100 MB storage space you
could hold around 2,500 images.
Unless you’re a big-time seller, you really don’t
need that much space. Your eBay images should
be archived on your computer (how about in a
folder called eBay Images?). Images for current
listings should only be on the hosted site while
the transaction is in progress. When the buyer
has the item, and all is well, you can remove it
from the remote server.
You most likely already have free image 
hosting on your ISP’s Web site, as noted in
Technique 19.

Designing listings: The basis of most of these
products is a good listing function. You’ll be able
to select from supplied templates or be able to
design your own and store them for future use.
An important feature now coming into use is a
spell checker. There’s nothing worse than a mis-
spelling in a listing!

Uploading listings: Most of these products have
a feature that launches a group of listings to eBay
all at once. They may also allow you to schedule
auctions to get underway at a prescribed time. 
You can also expect to be able to put together
your listings at your leisure offline and upload
them to your service. They will usually archive
your past listings so that you can relist at any time.
Many services also offer bulk relisting (relisting
many items at once).

E-mail management: You can expect to be able
to be provided with sample e-mail letters (tem-
plates) that you can customize with your own
look and feel. The services will also offer auto
generated end-of-auction, payment received,
and/or shipping e-mail service.

Feedback automation: Post feedback in bulk to a
number of your completed listings, or leave pre-
designed feedback one by one. Some products
support automatic feedback when a buyer leaves
you a positive message.

Sales reports: Some services (even the least
expensive) will offer you some sort of sales
analysis. Be sure to take into account how much
you really need these, based on data that you
may already receive from QuickBooks, PayPal,
eBay Stores, and SquareTrade.

Technique 60: Organizing with Auction Management Tools
342

Consignment tracking: If you are a Trading
Assistant (described in Technique 43), be sure to
look for a product that enables you to to sepa-
rately track the merchandise you sell for differ-
ent clients. You should also be able to produce
reports of consignment sale by customer.

Shipping: Most of the services will give you the
option to print your packing lists and shipping
labels directly from the product. Some of the
larger services integrate with the major shippers,
allowing you to go directly to his or her site and
ship from within their software.
Tables 60-1 and 60-2 give you the dollars and cents of
subscribing to various online and offline services. To
put together these tables, I disregarded lower sub-
scription levels where companies offered only listing
products. These are the lowest prices for products
that are truly management tools.
Exploring the Advanced
Features
Depending upon the type of business you run, you
may need some of the more advanced features
offered by management products:

Inventory tools: Management products may
allow you to create inventory records for your dif-
ferent products, permitting you to click a bunch
to automatically list. When an item is sold, they
will deduct the items from your inventory.

Sales-tax tracking and invoicing: With full man-
agement, you can expect your sales tax to be cal-
culated into your invoices, and complete
line-item invoices to be sent automatically.
Multiple items, when purchased by the same
buyer will be combined.

 Evaluating the need for a
network
 Setting up your network
Technique
Networking Your
Office
T
he first time I spoke to my editors about putting information in my
books about networking, they scoffed at me. Bah! People who work
at home don’t need networks (as if networks were solely for the big
companies with lots of cubicles). The more I spoke to the eBay commu-
nity, the more I saw the need for networks — and the more people asked
me about them.
I started writing about eBay in 1999, and now it’s 2004. A lot of technology
has washed under the bridge, and many advances have been made. Setting
up a network in 1999 meant spending hours (maybe days) changing set-
tings, testing, and checking computers; and it involved a lot of cursing.
That was if you were lucky enough to finally get it right. Otherwise, as in
the case of most home users — including me — you’d give up and take the
whole thing as a loss and go on with your life.
Lucky for us non-techie types, Microsoft has made Windows consider-
ably more home-network-friendly than in the old days. Also, more pleas-
ant modes of networking (other than having miles of Ethernet cables
going around the walls of your house) came to the fore of technology.
By networking your home (or eBay office) you’ll save time by having the
flexibility to work from different rooms or locations. (City dwellers, don’t
hate me for this.) You can also list auctions out by the pool (or in your
backyard) in summer!
Using a Powerline Network
When I tell you how simple to install and inexpensive a Powerline network
is, you’ll be shocked. Considering that I’m someone who likes to tinker
with things, I was upset that setting it up was so easy!
All you need to have to share a high-speed Internet connection, files, and
printers are:

Electrical outlets: I’ll bet you have more than one in each room of your
house.


An Ethernet card for each computer: If your
computer doesn’t already have one (and many
new computers do), you can get inexpensive
Ethernet cards for around $10.

A wall-plugged Ethernet bridge for each com-
puter: The basis for the setup is a small box,
about the size of a pack of cigarettes, that plugs
into any two- or three-pronged electrical outlet.
Take a look at one in Figure 61-1.
• Figure 61-1: Netgear’s wall-plugged Ethernet bridge.

A router: You only need this higher-end bit of
gear if you intend to connect a high-speed
Internet connection throughout your home or
office (and isn’t that really the point of all this?).
The benefits of this nifty little system are various:

It’s inexpensive. The requisite magic box costs
around $40. You need one for each computer.

It’s fast — as fast, or faster than, other types of
network connection. You could stream DVD
movies from one room to another.

The networking connection is made through
your existing electrical wiring. It doesn’t con-
sume extra electricity.

Installation is easy. Just plug a cable into your
computer, and connect it to the Powerline box.
Plug in Powerline box. 

If your computer comes with an Ethernet jack,
(most new computers do) you don’t need to
open up your computer and touch things you
shouldn’t be touching.
If you have a high-speed Internet connection, no
doubt you received a modem when you signed up.
Since it’s not sensible to connect the modem directly
to your computer (a router does the work for you —
see Tip below), you may already have a router.
A router allows you to share a single Internet
IP address among multiple computers. A
router does exactly what its name implies; it
routes signals and data to the different com-
puters on your network. If you have one com-
puter, the router can act as a firewall, or even
a network device leading to a print sharer. But
basically, to hook up more than one computer,
you do need a router.
The integration works like this:

The high-speed connection comes in through
your DSL or cable line.

The cable line plugs into your modem.

An Ethernet cable goes from your modem into a
router.

One “out” Ethernet cable connection from the
router goes to a local computer.

Another “out” Ethernet cable goes to the
Powerline adapter.

The Powerline box is plugged into a convenient
wall outlet.
Take a look at Figure 61-2 for a graphic display.
• Figure 61-2: A typical base setup for the Powerline
network.
When you want to connect the computers in other
rooms to the network, just plug in a magic box.

your wireless transmissions and prevent others from
getting into your network. Although super-hackers
have cracked this system, it’s the best possible until
a new security system is invented.
To link your laptop or desktop to a wireless network
with WEP encryption, you will need to have the key
code from the wireless access point. Just enter it into
your wireless card software onto every computer that
uses the network and you should be good to go.
The WiFi hotspots you may come to may not
have any encryption, and they are free for all
to use.
The types of wireless
If you’ve ever used a wireless telephone at home,
you’ve used a technology similar to a wireless net-
work. Most home wireless phones transmit to each
other on the radio frequency band of 2.4 GHz, and
they have the option to choose from several chan-
nels automatically to give you the best connection.
The two prevalent forms of wireless networks also
work on the 2.4GHz band, and you will need to pre-
set the channel when you set up the system. But
there are three kinds:

802.11a: This is a wireless format that works
really well — fast with good connectivity. It’s
used when you have to serve up a wireless con-
nection to a large group of people, as in a con-
vention center or dormitory. It’s fast, delivering
data at speeds as high as 54 Mbps (megabits per
second). It also runs at the 5GHz band (hence its
nickname WiFi5), so it doesn’t have any competi-
tion for bandwidth with wireless phones or
microwave ovens. It’s also very expensive.

802.11b: My laptop has a built-in 802.11b card,
so I can connect to the ever-popular “HotSpots”
in Starbucks and airports. It’s the most common
wireless type, and it’s used on the most plat-
forms right now. The B version is slower than the
A version, only capable of transferring data at 
11 Mbps. It’s a solid, low-cost solution when you
have no more than 32 users per access point.
So many networks, so little time
The best part of networking today is that you can combine
more than one type of network to form a fully functional,
professional data transfer medium with Internet access
throughout the house. In my house, I have my own bizarre
hybrid. I’ve got an Ethernet/home phone line/wireless com-
bination. Home phone line networks (10 Mbps networks
operating over existing phone lines without the need for
additional wiring, routers, or hubs) didn’t end up becoming
real popular with the consumers. It’s not that they didn’t
work flawlessly; they did. It’s just that it seems that I’m the
only one in the United States with enough free phone jacks
in their home and office to make it work.
After the downfall of Phoneline architecture, the geniuses
began to think, “What does that average home have lots of
outlets for?” Hmmmm, how about electricity? Duh . . . and
the Powerline network was born, running a network through
the electric outlets in homes and apartments.
Now we have wireless networks too — and they’re life-
changing when they work. It’s funny to see a whole new
generation of people moving around antennas to try to get
a good signal. It reminds me of television when I was a kid
(maybe I should put some tin foil around the wireless
antenna?).
Going Wireless
Wireless networking, also known as WiFi, or to the
more technically inclined, IEEE 802.11 networking,
is the hot new technology for all kinds of networks.
It’s a very impressive system when it works, with no
cables or connectors to bog you down. 
As a matter of fact, I was in New York recently, stay-
ing on the 16th floor of a hotel. I turned on my travel
laptop to check e-mail and my laptop found signals
for nine different wireless networks! I had to call the
front desk to find out which one was the hotel con-
nection. The whole world seems to be going wireless.
Just so you know, I wouldn’t have been able to con-
nect to the other networks. Wireless networks are
protected by their own brand of security, called WEP
(or Wired Equivalent Privacy). WEP will encrypt

Using a Hybrid Network
347
The lower frequency of 2.4 GHz drains less
power from laptops and other portable
devices. If you’re using a laptop, the battery
will last longer. Also, 2.4GHz signals travel 
farther — and can work through walls and
floors more effectively — than 5GHz signals.

802.11g: This is the newest flavor based on the
2.4GHz band. It speeds data up to a possible 
54 Mbps, and it’s backward compatible to work
where the 802.11b service is available.
Setting up your wireless network
With a wireless network, you’ll have to hook your
computer (a laptop works best) to the Wireless
Access Point (the access point is the gizmo with the
antenna that broadcasts your signal throughout
your home or office) to perform some beginning
setup tasks like choosing your channel and setting
up your WEP code. (The wireless access point will
come with instructions for your particular brand.)
After you complete the setup and you turn your
Wireless Access Point on, you will have a WiFi
hotspot in your home or office. Typically, your new
hotspot will provide coverage for about 100 feet in
all directions, although walls and floors definitely
cut down on the range. Even so, you should get good
coverage throughout a typical home. For a large
home, you can buy signal boosters to increase the
range of your hotspot.
Simplified, this is how your network will be 
configured:
1.
Run a cable from your DSL line to your modem.
2.
Connect an Ethernet cable from your modem to
your router.
3.
Connect the Ethernet cable to your Wireless
Access Point.
Take a look at this network diagram from Netgear in
Figure 61-3.
• Figure 61-3: A typical home wireless network.
Using a Hybrid Network
You may find that a wireless network may not work
throughout your home. That’s easy to fix. You can
combine different networks together, allowing you to
have wireless connectivity in some rooms of your
house and in your backyard, and a wired network
inside the house.
At my house, I have an old-fashioned home phoneline
network coming from my router, along with a wireless
Access point. They’re all the same brand, Netgear, so
there are no compatibility problems. This way, no
matter where I go (or if my family wants to log on to
the Internet), we can hook up with ease.

Keeping Kosher:
Staying Away
from Spam
E
very morning when I get to my computer, I have to allow about five
minutes to clear the spam out of my e-mail. It used to take up to a
half hour, considering that I flip on my computer and am greeted
by close to 200 e-mails every day. It used to be a terrifying time when I
clicked my Send/Receive button in Outlook. I never knew what would be
coming down the pike or wires. Read further on to see how I’ve cut my
spam-scanning time!
Spam has gotten so sneaky. Everyone is scurrying to get the latest in anti-
spam software, but I’ve found that antispam software was causing me to
lose e-mail that I needed (because it seems that the word “eBay” is a
favorite of spammers). These programs, because of my liberal use of the
word eBay, often bounce the newsletter I send out to my readers from my
Web site. Sometimes, I do a spot check with a reader, and they say they
want the newsletter; the problem is that their spam protection refuses it.
There’s not much I can do!
I want news on eBay — but I don’t want to get those make-a-fortune-on-
eBay e-mails. Nor do I want to help out dear Mr. Felix Kamala, son of the
late Mr. A.Y. Kamala. It seems his family lost millions in Zimbabwe to a
scammer in the government, and he wanted me to help him get his secret
stash of “Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars.” He
was going to give me 20 percent just for helping him — how thoughtful! (In
case you didn’t know, this e-mail is part of what the FBI calls the Nigerian
e-mail scam — also called the 419 scam — named after the African Penal
code violated with this crime.)
A fine member of the Internet community collects these e-mails and
posts them on his Web site, www.potifos.com/fraud. Check out the
page when you have a minute — it’s quite funny!
For the record, I’m also very comfortable with the size of my body parts; I
don’t want to buy drugs from some stranger over the Internet; and I don’t
need another mortgage.
Some scams aren’t so amusing. They’re the ones who pretend to be from
eBay, PayPal, Citibank, and others, and try to bilk you out of your personal

information. I show you a foolproof way to recognize
them as well.
In this technique, I’m also going to show you how
spammers get your e-mail address. Even if you never
give it out, they have ways of getting it from you. I
hope to teach you how to be a little more savvy
about which e-mails you open and how to fight back.
Keeping Your E-mail
Address Quiet
Have you ever signed up for anything on the Internet?
Before you signed up, did you check to see if the
site had a posted Privacy Policy page? You probably
didn’t. After you type your name in a box on the
Internet on a site with no spam or privacy policy,
you’re basically giving your privacy away, because
you’re considered an “opt in” customer. Opt In means
that you asked to be on a list, and the site that now
has your e-mail address can sell it to spammers.
Take a look at Figure 62-1. It’s a portion of an ad that
should really scare you. It’s an eBay auction for a CD
containing 140,000,000 opt-in e-mail addresses. Yes,
and you can buy all fourteen-million potential suck-
ers for only $5.
• Figure 62-1: A tempting offer to violate people’s privacy.
Just opening your e-mail can give you away as well.
Spammers will often (as you can tell by some of the
To addresses) make up return e-mail addresses to
mask their true location. If you open and view their
e-mail, the e-mail sends a notice to the spammer’s
server and then they know that your e-mail address
is valid. This can be masked in the HTML to occur
when the e-mail consists of merely a picture — when
it goes back to grab the picture for your e-mail, it
reports your e-mail address is good.
Recognizing Spam
I guess this isn’t rocket science. Much of the spam
you get can be recognized by the subject line. I used
to check my e-mail once I downloaded it to my com-
puter. That’s a pretty dangerous procedure, though,
considering that some e-mails do their job without
your even having to respond. 
Finding spam before it finds you
Now I’m using a program called MailWasher Pro.
When I flip on my computer in the morning I open
MailWasher and see the giant barrage of trash in my
mailbox as in Figure 62-2.
• Figure 62-2: MailWasher (the Free version).
MailWasher lists your e-mail directly from your ISP’s
server. It does NOT download the e-mail to your
computer. By using MailWasher, you can delete the
offending e-mails from your mailbox, and then bring
only the ones you want into your e-mail program.
As you can see from the figure, I can find out all the
following:

Who sent the e-mail: I’m not really acquainted
with Lavonne N. Bingham (note that her e-mail
address ends in .be — that’s Belgium). I’m also
not familiar with Viola Cantu, who strangely has
jsavcxy as her e-mail ID at Yahoo!. Not to mention
my buddy, chun-she (otherwise known as 
carrie@t-online.de). Hmmm, Germany? Nope.
Don’t know anyone there either.

I certainly don’t want to lose my PayPal account, so
I’d better click the link and give them the informa-
tion they need. 
Or how about an e-mail from PayPal that says: We
recently reviewed your account and suspect that
your PayPal account may have been accessed by 
an unauthorized third party. Protecting the
security of your account and of the PayPal 
network is our primary concern. Therefore, 
as a preventative measure, we have temporarily 
limited access to sensitive PayPal account 
features.
Click below in order to regain access to your
account:
STOP RIGHT THERE!
Take a good look at the e-mail. Who is it
addressed to? When PayPal sends you an
e-mail, the opening line says Dear (your 
registered name). In my case, a real e-mail
from PayPal would only address the opening
as “Dear Marsha Collier.” These spam e-mails
are usually addressed to “Dear Valued User”
or “Dear youre-mailaddress.com.” PayPal will
never address an e-mail to your e-mail
address!
Responding to these e-mails is tantamount to giving
away your information to a stranger. Let me give you
a tip on another way to double-check these e-mails.
Open the e-mail, as I have in Figure 62-3. Right-click
your mouse and find the option to View Source.
With the menu open, click View Source with your left
mouse button. Text will open up on your computer
in notepad. You will now see the e-mail in HTML text.
Scroll to the bottom, in this case, to the line that
says Please follow the link below... followed by
a URL, as shown in Figure 62-4.

E-mail subject: Just in case Chun-she really does
know me, they should know that I don’t read
Cyrillic, and, as the subject line is Ilocemume
ceMuHap, I’m pretty sure I can delete that one.
And although Velma sent me an e-mail letting me
know how much I’d enjoy something, I’m really
too busy to enjoy anything just now, so I guess
I’ll delete that e-mail too.

To: Notice that the To line can be a definite tip-
off. If someone has e-mailed to a name other than
my own or to an e-mail box at my Web site (with
news about mortgages), I can fairly assume that
the e-mail wasn’t sent by someone I know. For
example, one e-mail was sent to Yvette. I have no
Yvette at this e-mail address! There are no dum-
mies here either.

Attachments: Yes or none. If there’s an attach-
ment from someone I don’t know, I delete the
entire e-mail. As a matter of fact, I delete most
e-mails with attachments. If a friend wants to
send me something, they can always resend if I
delete it accidentally (or on purpose).
MailWasher allows you to put check marks next to
suspect e-mails. You can merely delete them, or you
can bounce them back to whence they came and
blacklist them (so they’ll always be marked for dele-
tion if they e-mail you again).
My e-mail program is set to only get e-mail from the
server when I ask it to, so after I delete all the spam,
I can click Send/Receive and feel considerably safer.
Also, although I use the Pro version (see my Web site
for more details), which can scan more than one
e-mail account, you should download the free ver-
sion for one e-mail account and see if you like it
before paying $29.95 for the Pro version. You can
download the free version at www.mailwasher.net.
Checking out nefarious e-mail
What? It seems I’ve gotten an e-mail from PayPal.
They say my account needs to be renewed. Oh my!

• Figure 62-3: Checking to View Source on an e-mail.
• Figure 62-4: The HTML coding for the link URL address.
Take a good long look at the figure. You’ll see the link
to the URL in the e-mail. But look just before it in the
source code and you can see that you’re really being
redirected to http://66.223.44.203/cgi/index.htm —
not to the PayPal secure URL!
When I click the link, I come to an exact duplicate of
the PayPal Log In page — or is it? A quick glance at
the Address bar of my browser confirms I’ve been
misdirected, as shown in Figure 62-5. If I were at
PayPal, the URL address would read
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/
webscr?cmd=_login-run
(Note that the real PayPal URL begins with https, not
an http URL; https stands for secure.)
Even checking the URL may be misleading if
you’re using Internet Explorer as your browser.
A vulnerability has been identified, which can
be exploited by bad deed doers to display a
fake URL in the address and status bars. To
avoid these Microsoft glitches, be sure to keep
your Windows critical updates, er, up to date.
Visit http://windowsupdate.microsoft.
com regularly and allow critical security updates
to be installed.
• Figure 62-5: My address bar with the misdirected URL.
You can use the right-click and View Source
trick on any HTML e-mail, and HTML e-mail is
what fraudsters use to hide the misdirected
address.
If you still question whether your PayPal or eBay
account has a problem, close the e-mail and go
directly to the site and log in at the real URL. If there
is a problem with your account, believe me, they’ll
let you know after you properly log in.
Fighting Back!
There’s quite a bit that you can do to help stop this
flood. Spam comes in many forms and eventually, if
things keep going the way they do, cleaning spam
will be a full-time proposition.
Have you ever clicked the link at the bottom of some
spam you’ve received to have your name removed
from their list? I have — at least I used to — until I
found out that’s the gold standard for spammers to
collect valid e-mail addresses! If you respond to the
spam in any way, shape, or form, they know they
have found a valid address — and watch the spam to
your mailbox increase!
Never, I repeat, never click one of those links again.

spam to the sender’s ISP. These days they’re mostly
forged with aliases, and all you’ll do is succeed in
clogging up the e-mail system. The following is a list
of places you can go to report spammers:

Federal Trade Commission: Yes, your tax
dollars are at work. You can forward spam to
uce@ftc.gov, where it will become available for
law enforcement. (Especially in the case of e-mail
trying to get your personal information.)

spamcop.net: They’ve been around since 1988
and report spam e-mails to ISPs and mailers. They
have a reporting link on their home page, and
they work hard to get spamsters out of the loop.
When signing up for some sort of newsletter
with an organization you’re new to or unsure
of, be sure to use an anonymous Yahoo! or
HotMail address. It’s easy enough to sign up
for one, and if spammers get hold of that
address, they will not be privy to your private
address.
Also, no matter how curious you are about enlarging
certain parts of your anatomy, don’t even open the
e-mails. But in any case, don’t respond. You’re only
encouraging the vicious cycle.
Last, report spammers. There are several legitimate
sites that take reports and forward them to the appro-
priate authorities. Don’t bother trying to forward the

W
hen was the last time you changed your passwords? I mean the
whole enchilada: eBay, PayPal, your online bank account? Hey,
I’m not the keeper of the shoulds, but you should change your
critical passwords every 60 days — rain or shine. That’s not just me say-
ing that. It’s all the security experts who know this kind of stuff. The
world is full of bad-deed-doers just waiting to get their hands on your
precious personal information. Password theft can lead to your bank
account being emptied, your credit cards being pushed to the max, and
worst of all, someone out there posing as you.
You’ve seen the commercials on TV poking fun at the very real problem
of identity theft. If you ask around your circle of friends, no doubt you’ll
find someone who knows someone who’s been in this pickle. It can take
years to undo the damage caused by identity theft, so a better plan is to
stay vigilant and protect yourself from becoming a victim. 
In this technique, I give you tips for selecting good passwords and other
personal security information. I also show you the sort of passwords to
stay away from and what to do if (heaven forbid!) your personal informa-
tion is compromised.
Reporting Messed-Up Accounts
If someone gets hold of your personal information, the most important
thing to do is report it immediately. If you see any items that aren’t yours
on the Items I’m Bidding On or the Items I’m Selling areas of your My eBay
page, it’s time to make a report — and fast!
Okay, you know that something hinky is going on with your eBay account
because you never placed a bid on the Britney Spears stage-worn T-shirt

double-check with him just to be sure). Here’s what to do immediately:

home computer: Don’t forget to change the pass-
word on your computer’s e-mail software as well
(Outlook, Eudora, and the like) so you can con-
tinue to download your e-mail from the server.
Perhaps you discover that your private information
has been compromised when you suddenly can’t log
in to your eBay or PayPal account. If this happens on
eBay, follow these steps to request a new password:

Go to the eBay Sign In page.
Don’t type your password. You just tried that

Choosing a Good 
Secret Question
If you read the harrowing procedure in the “Freaking
out is not a good thing” sidebar, you know that hav-
ing someone sabotage your eBay account is some-
thing you never want to go through. But if your
secret question is easy to figure out, a hacker can
find it even easier to wreak havoc on your account.
Your password is only as secure as the secret
question, so don’t relate your password and
secret question in any way. For example, do
not make your secret question a clue to your
password — and especially don’t make your
password answer the secret question. Better
yet, think of your secret question  as a com-
pletely separate, auxiliary security device for
your account.
Figure 63-3 shows eBay’s Create a Secret Question
and Answer page, which you can access from your
My eBay Preferences page. It shows several suggested
questions.

Technique 63: Keeping Password Accounts Secure
356
crooks who hack into an account, spend a few thou-
sand dollars that belong to someone else, and
move on.
I searched Google for hacking software and came up
with over two million matches. Many of these Web
sites offer an arsenal of free hacking tools. They also
provide step-by-step instructions for beginners on
how to crack passwords. The Internet can be its own
worst enemy.
Any password can be cracked by the right person in
a matter of seconds. Your goal is to set a password
that takes too much of the hackers’ time. With the
number of available users on eBay or PayPal, odds
are they’ll go to the next potential victim’s password
rather than spending many minutes (or even hours)
trying to crack yours.
Here are some industrial-strength tips for setting a
secure password.

Number of characters: Compose your password
of more than 8 characters.

Case sensitivity: Since passwords are case-
sensitive, take advantage of the feature. Mix
lower- and uppercase in your passwords.

Letters and numbers: Combine letters and num-
bers to make your passwords harder to crack. 

Proper words: Don’t use proper words. Think of
the title of your favorite book. Make your pass-
word the first two letters of each word with num-
bers in the middle (not sequential).
Stay Smart: Don’t be a Make-It-Easy!
Any beginning hacker (or tech-smart teenager) can figure
out your password if it falls into the following categories.
Don’t use ’em! They are pathetically easy!

The obvious: The word Password. D’oh!

Birthdays: Don’t use your birthday, your friend’s
birthday, John F. Kennedy’s birthday. Not only are
these dates common knowledge, but so is this tru-
ism: A series of numbers is easy to crack.
Here are some tips for setting a secure secret 
question:

Never use your mother’s maiden name. That is
most likely the secret that your bank uses as your
challenge question. (They usually ask when you
open the account.) So that is definitely out —
you don’t want to give anybody that word.

Select a question and provide a creative answer.
 What is your Pet’s name? Give an answer like
Ralph the Rhino or Graak the Pterodactyl or
something creative. Don’t give your actual
pet’s name (or species). Anyone who knows
you is likely to know your pet’s name.
 What street did you grow up on? Name an
unusual landmark from your hometown. Don’t
use a street name.
 What is the name of your first school? Make
up a good one — perhaps Elementary Penguin
Academy? School of Hard Knox?
It should go without saying, but what the heck:
Don’t use any of the sample passwords shown
here. It’s safe to say that lots of people will be
reading this book, and anything seen by lots of
people isn’t secret. (I know you know that, but
still. . .)
 What is your father’s middle name? Make up
a goodie or skip it.
 What is your school’s mascot? There’s a lot of
creativity that can go on here. How about Red-
and-white-striped zebra? Pink elephant?
Your bylaws for selecting answers to a secret ques-
tion are two: Be creative and be sure you remember
the darned thing! 
Selecting a Good Password
Poorly chosen passwords are the number-one loop-
hole for hackers. If you think that hackers are just
a small group of hypercaffeinated teenagers, think
again. It’s now also the domain of small- and big-time

Selecting a Good Password
357

Names: Don’t use your first name, last name, your
dog’s name, or anyone’s name. Again, it’s common
knowledge and easy to find out. (Most people know
my husband’s name; it’s been in many of my books!)

Contact numbers: Social Security (if they get hold of
that one — watch out!), phone numbers, your e-mail
address, or street address (got a White Pages? So do
they . . .).

Any of the lousy passwords in Table 63-1: These
have been gleaned from the millions of password
dictionaries available from hackers. Note that this
is not a complete list by any means; there are thou-
sands of common (lousy) passwords, and unprint-
able ones are more common than you may think. If
you really care to scare yourself, Google the phrase
common passwords.

Letting the World
Know All About 
You, er, Me
T
he About Me page is a really fun and helpful tool on eBay — and it’s
free to every registered eBay user. Having an About Me page shows
the community you’re jumping in with both feet. Prospective cus-
tomers can use your About Me page to get to know a little more about
you — to get a sense of your personality and your dedication. You can
use your About Me page as a tool to direct customers to your eBay Store
(or to your own Web site — About Me is the only place on eBay that it’s
legal to post an off-eBay commerce Web site).
eBay members like to check out both sellers and buyers on the site. By
learning about your potential trading partner, you get information — and
information is key to preventing fraud. From an eBay member’s About Me
page, you can see just how involved they are in the eBay business world.
The About Me page can also be a deal maker, or a deal breaker. Once I
was looking around eBay for some extra long printer cables, and I found
several sellers selling just what I wanted. One of the lower-priced sellers
had a low feedback rating — he was new at eBay. But, he had an About
Me page, so I clicked. I found out that the seller was a computer techni-
cian by trade and that he and his son made these computer cables
together as a family business at home in the evenings. The money they
made went to pay for their father-son trips to see their favorite baseball
team play. What a great family enterprise! Better yet, he guaranteed the
cables. As you might have guessed, I bought the cables, and we both got
positive feedback.
You can tell whether someone else has an About Me page because you’ll
see a small icon with a blue lowercase m and a red lowercase e. In this
technique, you find out how to put together your own About Me page (in
three minutes) and get to see some examples from longtime eBay sellers.
Getting Your About Me Page
Putting together your About Me page takes no time at all. Most of the
time you spend will be in the planning. (Check out some of the examples
of About Me pages toward the end of this technique for inspiration.)

Technique

Getting Your About Me Page
359
If you’ve been an advanced user on eBay for a while,
consider adding the following to your existing My
eBay page:

Your logo: If you’ve designed a logo for your
eBay business, be sure to put it on the page.

Returns policy: Outline your standard returns
policy on the page for your customers.

Shipping policy: Explain how you ship and when
you ship. Offer discounts on shipping for multi-
ple purchases through your eBay Store.

Searchable index to your eBay Store: Let your
customers search your store by apparel size,
brand name, or item. You can accomplish this by
HTML coding.

Payment methods: Let the customer know what
payment methods you accept.
Setting up the page
To set up your About Me page, follow these steps:
1.
Go to your My eBay Preferences tab, as shown
in Figure 64-1. Scroll down the page to find the
link under the About Me page heading.
• Figure 64-1: Step one in setting up your page.
2.
On the About Me hub page (where you end up),
click the Create or Edit Your Page button to
proceed, as shown in Figure 64-2.
The page can be as simple or as complex as you want.
You may use one of eBay’s templates as presented, or
you may gussy up the page with lots of pictures and
varied text using HTML. (See Technique 20.)
There are several things you must think about ahead
of time:

Title: Come up with a title for your page. It can
be as simple as a welcome greeting.

Subtitle: Decide on a few words to go below
your page title that elaborate on your page
theme.

Introductory paragraph: Structure this para-
graph to tell a little about you and your hobbies
or interests. You can also talk about the items
you sell on eBay, but most of all, it should reflect
your personality.
In the paragraphs of the About Me page, you
can use HTML to add images or fancy text.
The titles, however, are standard and won’t
permit HTML coding.

Second subtitle and paragraph: Elaborate on
your interests and your business on eBay. Add
more information. Pictures are good, too!

eBay activity: Decide what you’d like to show on
the page — like how many of your most recent
feedback comments — and whether you’d like to
show your current listings.
Don’t get carried away by showing your last
100 feedback messages; doing so takes up too
much space. Display either 10 or 25 and leave
it at that. If visitors want to know more about
your feedback rating, they can click your feed-
back number. (After all, they clicked your ME
icon to get here, and that’s next to your feed-
back number.)

Web-site links: Think of some of your favorite
Web sites; also include yours or a friend’s (ask
first). You may legally put these links on your
page.

• Figure 64-2: The About Me hub page.
3.
On the Choose a Layout page, decide whether
you want a centered, two-column, or multi-
column layout for your page.
eBay will show you examples, as shown in
Figure 64-3.
4.
Fill in the form with the information I describe
earlier in this technique.
• Figure 64-3: Deciding on your layout.
You can preview your page at any time by click-
ing the Continue button at the bottom of the
page. If you don’t like what you see, click Back,
and you can continue to edit your page.
I put together the page in Figure 64-4 for a friend
in about three minutes. It’s not the perfect About
Me page — but a simple page like this certainly
tells something about the seller. It will do until
you have time to put together a more profes-
sional look.
• Figure 64-4: A three-minute About Me page!
When you have an eBay Store, your About
Me page is also the About the Store page.
Your eBay Store’s graphic header will appear
at the top of your About Me page.
Using little-known, eBay-unique HTML tags
It’s not a highly publicized deal, but you can use
some special unique-to-eBay HTML codes that give
your About Me page a custom look. Some of these
codes can be combined with others (such as those
for bold and color). Play around with them and see
what you come up with! (See Technique 20 for more
HTML for your page.)
Table 64-1 gives you the secret codes (sorry, no
decoder rings) and shows you what they can do.

Okay, maybe they’re not all pros, but the About Me
eBay pages pictured in this section are from some

Due to page constraints, I couldn’t show you the
entire About Me pages, but just look them up in

the full picture there.
I show you the pages in order from part-time sellers,
to full-time sellers, to full-on eBay professionals.

Figure 64-5 shows my lowly About Me page. Since I’m
part-time on eBay (even though I’m a PowerSeller), I
chose to make my page personal. I talk about a little
eBay history, mention my books, and basically intro-
duce myself to the reader.

I think Steve Lindhorst changed his User ID from
greenfuz to listingrover because that’s what he does.
Steve specializes in selling big-ticket items like cars
at eBay Motors and also acts as a Trading Assistant

just now is that he’s been busy teaching at eBay

when prices and sales reach the maximum level. The
item is no longer hard-to-find.
Merchandise plan: Sales goals in dollar amounts
planned out for a prescribed period of time. (See
Technique 52.)

Technique 65: Glossary of eBay Sellers’ Business Terms
368
Price war: When two or more competitive sellers
lower their product price to undercut their competi-
tive sellers, thereby gaining market share.
Product life cycle: A chart depicting expected sell-
ing cycles of a product over its life.
Purchase order: A business form outlining the
details of a merchandise purchase, usually from a
retailer to a vendor.
Returns: Merchandise that has been accepted as a
return in a retail transaction. Often returns are
resold to eBay sellers as part of liquidation-lot mer-
chandise. (See Technique 5.)
Seconds: Merchandise that clearly contains damage
or imperfections. A step in quality below Irregulars.
(See Technique 5.)
SKU (Stock Keeping Unit): A number assigned to
each piece of inventory for identification and/or
tracking purposes. It may be your own number or it
may relate to the item’s UPC.
Sniping: The act (or fine art) of bidding at the very
last possible second of an auction. (See Technique 3.)
Spam: Unrequested and unwanted e-mail. (See
Technique 62.)
Staple merchandise: Items that people buy regard-
less of season, year in and year out.
Steamer: An electrical appliance used to remove
wrinkles from fabric. (See Technique 16.)
Stock-to-sales ratio: A planning tool that shows the
relationship between stock on hand and monthly
sales. This shows the amount of inventory required
to generate planned sales. Ideally it should be about
3:1, so you can have a three-month supply of inven-
tory. (See Techniques 25 and 52.)
Street price: The price that merchandise can be pur-
chased for at brick-and-mortar or online discounters.
Merchant account: A bank account that enables a
business to accept credit cards for payment — in
PayPal, a higher level account for larger sellers. (See
Technique 28.)
Middleman: The person between you and the manu-
facturer, if you’re not buying direct. (See Technique 5.)
MSRP: Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price. The
price (suggested by the manufacturer) that hardly
anybody is willing to pay.
Odd-cent pricing: Pricing your item with odd cents.
A technique that creates the impression that the
buyer will be getting a bargain.
Off-price merchandise: Manufacturers’ excess mer-
chandise that’s available to retailers at a consider-
able discount for resale.
Open to buy: In dollars, the amount left for acquir-
ing merchandise within a specific season or time
period.
Opt in: When a customer requests to be put on a
mailing list. (See Double Opt In.)
Penetration pricing: Cutting your profits to generate
more sales. Penetrate the market by gaining market
share to overthrow the competition.
Physical inventory: The actual physical count of
your merchandise versus what your bookkeeping or
management program says you have.
Plagiarism: When another seller steals your descrip-
tion and/or images and uses those materials in their
own sales. Report this eBay policy violation as Image
or description theft in the Security center. (See
Technique 6.)
Price skimming: Charging the highest price you can
for merchandise resulting in lower transactions
total, but a higher profit margin on the sales that
are completed.

Glossary
369
Turnover: The number of times your average
amount of stock sells during a given period. Turning
merchandise into cash.
UPC (Universal Product Code): The number that is
part of the barcode that is used to identify almost
any product. (You can also type a UPC into Google
for identification.)
UVM (Universal Vendor Marking): This is the prac-
tice of premarking items so their origin may be iden-
tified. Many eBay sellers use a UV pen to mark their
merchandise to prevent fraudulent returns. The
marks of these pens can only be seen with a UV light.
Warranty: A written guarantee of the seller’s or manu-
facturer’s responsibility toward the workability of the
product sold. It outlines the terms of return or repair.
