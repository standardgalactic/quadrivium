PREFACE
This book deals with the science of kinematics. Formally, kinematics is that 
branch of mechanics which treats the phenomenon of motion without regard 
to the cause of the motion. In kinematics there is no reference to mass or 
force; the concern is only with relative positions and their changes.
We have used the adjective theoretical in our title in order to distinguish 
our subject from applied kinematics, which deals with the application of 
kinematics: to mechanical contrivances, to the theory of machines, and to the 
analysis and synthesis of mechanisms. Much of what is written herein could be 
used to study mechanical devices. However, our aim is broader: what we give 
is the development of the theory independent of any particular application, a 
presentation of the subject as a fundamental science in its own right. By this, 
we hope to make these results equally accessible to other fields. This is 
important because our science touches on many areas: everything that moves 
has kinematical aspects. In recent years interesting applications of kinematics 
have, for example, been made in areas as diverse as: animal locomotion, art, 
biomechanics, geology, robots and manipulators, space mechanics, structural 
chemistry, and surgery.
Theoretical kinematics is a large subject and it is impossible to treat it 
completely in a single volume. In this book we restrict ourselves to what might 
be called the kinematics of spaces. We consider unbounded infinite spaces 
which contain idealized mathematical elements embedded in them. We 
mainly treat the linear elements (points, lines, planes) and study the geometric 
properties which arise as the space moves. Essentially we are dealing with 
aspects of what mathematicians call transformation geometry. We consider 
those transformations in Euclidean spaces such that all distances remain fixed. 
Often we will find it convenient to add the elements at infinity to our space; 
this clarifies the results and simplifies the terminology and analytical develop­
ment.
A characteristic feature of this book is the principle of starting with general 
concepts and problems and then specializing gradually to more simple cases.

PREFACE
Following this idea. Chapters I and II are written in terms of n-dimensional 
Euclidean spaces. Then we specialize to the important case n = 3, the major 
topic of the book, which could be called rigid body kinematics of three 
dimensions. We think of our mathematical space as representing an un­
bounded, rigid, material body.
The word displacement is used in kinematics in a rather special way. It 
implies that we have no interest in how a motion actually proceeds: we 
consider only the position before and the position after the motion. If the 
distances moved by any of the points are finite we say that we have a finite 
displacement, or simply a displacement. Also of interest is the limit of a finite 
displacement if the displaced position approaches the undisplaced one; these 
infinitesimal displacements play an important role in the theory, they are the 
subject of instantaneous kinematics. Our Chapters III, IV, V deal with two, 
three, and four (or more) positions theory, both for finite and instantaneous 
displacements. Chapter VI studies motion proper: continuous sets of dis­
placements. In accordance with our principle further specialization follows: 
spherical kinematics is dealt with in Chapter VII, planar kinematics in 
Chapter VIII. To illustrate the foregoing theory Chapter IX studies a 
selection of special motions; this chapter, more than any other borders on the 
subject of applied kinematics. The last four chapters are mutually indepen­
dent, each developes the fundamentals of an aspect of kinematics not 
previously dealt with in the book. In Chapter X we consider motions which 
depend upon two or more parameters. Chapter XI returns to planar 
kinematics and studies it by a new technique: planar positions are mapped on 
to the points of a three-dimensional space with an adapted metric. The final 
two Chapters, XII and XIII, are respectively concerned with the kinematics 
associated with various geometries in addition to the Euclidean one and with 
special mathematical methods.
In writing this book we have tried to expand the theory and to fill various 
gaps. We have also derived some old results in new ways. We believe this 
book to be the first on theoretical kinematics written in the English language. 
It addresses itself to the researcher in the field and to the advanced student.
The treatment in the text is mainly analytical. However, geometric in­
terpretations are given, and in places synthetic reasoning is also applied. With 
regard to the necessary mathematical tools, it is essential that the reader 
understands the basics of homogeneous coordinates of points and planes in 
order to be able to study what happens to the elements at infinity; when we 
deal with lines in space we use the homogeneous Pliicker coordinates, defined 
in the text. Furthermore, we have, in the main, limited ourselves to the

mathematics of algebraic geometry, vector and matrix algebra and elemen­
tary calculus. Special mathematical methods (such as quaternions and dual 
numbers) are reserved for the final chapter, where they are briefly introduced 
as subjects in their own right.
The reader should note that in order to limit the length of the text we have 
presented some material without proof; it is generally set in small print and 
denoted “Example”. Although mainly written in the form of exercises, we 
regard this material as an essential part of the text.

CHAPTER I
EUCLIDEAN DISPLACEMENTS
1. Displacements
A transformation T(P—> P') of Euclidean n-space En is defined by giving 
each point P an image point P' such that a one-to-one correspondence 
between P and P' exists: each point P' is the image of exactly one point P. 
Hence P'-
*P
 is also a transformation, the inverse of T, denoted by ТЛ If 
Tt(P-> P') and T2(P'—► P") are two transformations P P" is a transforma­
tion, called the product T2Ti. Obviously (T3T2)Ti is equal to ТэСГ2Т|): the 
multiplication of transformations is associative. There is a unit transformation 
I(P -> P). It follows from all this that the transformations of E" form a group.
If T(P P') has the property that for all point pairs P, R, the distance P'R' 
is equal to the distance PR the transformation is called a Euclidean 
displacement. In this book kinematics is essentially the study of Euclidean 
displacements, and, unless otherwise stated, a displacement is Euclidean. If D 
is a displacement, D‘‘ is a displacement; if Di and D2 are displacements the 
same holds for D2D,; I is a displacement. Therefore: the displacements form a 
group. It is a sub-group of the group of transformations and it consists of 
those which leave the distance of any two points invariant.
If D(P-> P') and P, R, S are collinear points, from P'R' = PR, P'S' = PS, 
(R'S'= RS), it follows that P',R', S'are collinear. Therefore: a displacement 
transforms a line I, into a line Г; D is a collineation. By the same reasoning we 
conclude that the points of a plane or, in general, the points of a linear 
subspace E*  of E” are transformed into those of a linear subspace Ew of the 
same dimension.
If 1, m are parallel lines, which means that they are in a plane E2 and have 
no point of intersection, Г and m' are in the plane Er and they have no 
common point because D is a transformation. Thus parallelism of lines is 
maintained by displacements. A displacement is an affine transformation. If 
E*  and Em are parallel subspaces so are Ek and Em,

(CH. 1.51
If P, R, S are the vertices of a triangle the images P',R\ S' form a triangle 
with equal corresponding sides and thus with equal corresponding angles. 
Therefore: displacements are angle-preserving (often called conformal) trans­
formations. In particular: right angles correspond to right angles. This implies 
that not only the distance between two points but also the distance between a 
point and a linear subspace, and the distance between two parallel subspaces, 
are invariant under displacements.
We define an n-dimensional reference space I" and regard this space as 
fixed (in the sense that its points are invariant under all displacements). We 
take an arbitrary point O, in 2", as the origin, and associate with each point 
P, R, S,... of En its position vector P = OP, R = OR. S = OS,... in I". For 
the displaced space with points P', R', S',... in E"' we have position vectors 
P' - OP', R' = OR', S'-OS'y... in 2". For points in E"
*  we have 
P", R", S”,... in Xя, and so on. For the vectors in Xя we have the usual 
definition for the scalar (or so-called dot) product of two vectors. Geometri­
cally, the scalar product of two vectors, say t>( and v2, is the scalar v2 cos 0; t>, 
being the length of and 0 the angle between and v2. It is easy to show 
that it is commutative and distributive; v, • v, or v1, for short, is the square of 
the length of ct.
A displacement D(P—»P') is seen to be a transformation such that 
(P'-R')2 = (P-R)2 for all point pairs P. R. Obviously the transformation 
P'= P + d,d being a fixed vector, is a displacement. It is a special one, called 
a translation. If P, R are two points, PR' has not only the same length as PR 
but the line P'R' is also parallel to PR. I is a translation. If D is a translation 
D1 is a translation. If D, and D2 are the translations P' = P + P" = P' + d2, 
then D2Di is a translation and D2D, = D)D2. Therefore the translations form a 
commutative group, which is a subgroup of the displacements group, d is 
called the vector of the translation. It is independent of the choice of origin.
If for a certain displacement D a point P coincides with its image P' this 
point is called a fixed point or a double point of D. All points are fixed points 
for the displacement I. A translation, different from I, has no fixed points.
A displacement for which a point О is a fixed point is called a rotation 
about О. I is a rotation about O. If R is a rotation about О then so is R1; if Rt 
and R2 are rotations about O, R2R, and R,R2 are rotations about O. Thus the 
rotations about О constitute a subgroup of the displacements group. It is not 
commutative, for in general RaRi and R|R2 are different displacements, as we 
shall see.
If D is a displacement, О an arbitrary point, O' its image, S the translation 
with vector d = OO' then S-,D is clearly a rotation R about O. From

S 'D = R it follows D = SR; a displacement is the product of a rotation (about 
an arbitrarily chosen point) and a translation.
2. Orthogonal matrices
We consider a rotation R about the origin O. Let l/b l/2,..., 17„ be n 
linearly independent unit vectors (in E", measured in Xя); then an arbitrary 
vector P may be written in a unique way as a linear function of U„ namely as
P = (P-l7,)l/,+(P-l/2)l/2+--- + (P-U)U = S(P-U)U, 
< -1
or P = (P • Ut)U„ if we make use of the summation convention for repeated 
indices. If P' is the image of P and U', (i = 1,2,..., л) that of U„ we have 
P' = (P' • U',)U't. But from the definition of a displacement the relation 
P' • (75« P • U, is true for all i. Therefore P' = (P • 17,)(7'. This means that the 
image P' of a general point P is known if the images U't of the set U, are given 
for the rotation.
It is clear that if the I/, are given the set U', cannot be arbitrary, because the 
relation If • U, = U't* (7J must hold for all i and j. In order to obtain simple 
conditions it seems wise to make use of Cartesian sets: let 17, be n mutually 
orthogonal unit vectors. Then it is necessary that the unit vectors U\ are also 
mutually orthogonal. On the other hand this is also sufficient to insure that the 
transformation is a displacement: if P and R are two points, we have 
P,-R,= [(P-Vl)-(R-Vl)}U\ and therefore (Pf - R')2 = S,{(P - R) • (7J2, 
in view of U\ •U,f= 
(&, =0 for i/ j and = 1 for i = /), and this is
furthermore equal to (P - R)2. The conclusion is: a rotation about О is fully 
determined if the ordered set of mutually orthogonal unity vectors U\ is 
known as the image of a given set U, of such vectors (i = l,...,n). So the 
problem to determine analytically the rotations about О is reduced to that of 
finding all such sets 17;. Any U', can be expressed in terms of (7k; indeed we 
have (7; = (V, • (7k )(7k or, if we denote (7', • (7k by a,k we have U\ - a,kUk. The 
orthogonality relations for 17', are seen to be V\ • or a,ka,k = in view 
of (7, • Ц = 5,,. They are Jn(n + 1) in number and express as many conditions 
for the n2 numbers U't • Uk, that is for the cosines of the angles between the V 
and the 17' axes.
The matrix ||atk || with alk in the Г*  row and the kth column is called an 
orthogonal matrix. If the basis vectors (7, are given this matrix determines the 
rotation; indeed 171 = a<k(7k and P' = (P • If)U' and thus P' = a,k(P • I7,)(7k,

the right hand side being a double sum over the repeated indices i and k. The 
symbol P' = AP is often introduced for this relation, where A is an abbrevia­
tion for the matrix || atk ||, P is the column matrix representation of the vector, 
and P' is also in column matrix form. The transformation P—»P' is thus 
expressed as a matrix multiplication.
To our rotation R (essentially given by U, —* l/t, that is by 1/1=0^14) 
belongs the inverse rotation R~‘, expressed by Ut = akl/i, where || is the 
inverse of the matrix || a*  ||, which because of our (1,1) correspondence cannot 
be singular. In view of a,k = U'rUt and analogously a\k = Ui
*U'
k it follows 
elk = flk.. Therefore A has the property that its inverse is identical with its 
transpose : A'1 = AT, and it is easily seen that this property characterizes the 
orthogonal matrices.
If A is the determinant of А, A~‘ is that of A-1 and A is that of AT; therefore 
Д2= 1 and thus A= ±1. Both cases exist: for I we have A«l; for the 
orthogonal matrix = - 1, a„ = 1 (i/ 1), a,k = 0 (i/ k), A = - 1. If Ri and 
R2 are two rotations about O, to which the matrices A = Цо
*
 || and В = ||Ь141| 
belong, then from U' = a,kUk and U” = b*Ul
 it follows that U7 = bikakiUh or 
1/7=с((Ц with Cu-blkakl\ that is, if C = ||cA|| we have C = BA from the 
multiplication rule for matrices. It is well-known that the multiplication of 
matrices is not commutative. This implies that the product of two rotations is 
also not commutative.
3. The eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix
We have seen that a rotation R about О is accompanied by an orthogonal 
matrix А = ||ал||. It is clear that this matrix depends on the way we have 
described the rotation analytically and this was done by means of the 
arbitrarily chosen set of Cartesian basis vectors Ut. Suppose that we take 
another orthogonal Cartesian set V, and that by our rotation it transforms to 
VJ. Applying the general formula P' = atk(P • U,)Uk for P = Vt we obtain 
V;= a<k(Vt • Ui)Uk = q,<alkUk = b^U^q,, are the elements of an orthogonal 
matrix Q and blk those of В = QA. Furthermore Uk = (14 • V/)V, in which 
<4 • Уi = qtk, so that VJ = b)kqlk Vt = bikqkiVt where qkt = qlk is the (k, /)-

about О is described by an orthogonal matrix A in a certain reference system

EIGENVALUES OF AN ORTHOGONAL MATRIX

orthogonal matrix whose elements are the cosines between the bases of the 
two systems. Making use of the terminology of matrix algebra we may say that 
A' and A are equivalent within the group of orthogonal matrices, which we 
denote by A'^A. It is easily seen that this concept is symmetric (A'^A 
implies A s A') and transitive (from A,^A and A2^A it follows A|SA2). 
Summing up: a rotation R about О corresponds to a class of mutually 
equivalent orthogonal matrices. In each reference system the rotation is 
described by a matrix which is a member of the class. The class as such is 
independent of the reference system.
It is clear that a property of a matrix A which describes the rotation is only 
of interest if it is independent of the choice of the reference system, which 
means that A shares that property with all its equivalent matrices. A property 
common to all members of the class is called an invariant.
We have seen that the determinant Д of an orthogonal matrix is either 1 or 
- 1. Obviously equivalent matrices A and A'= QAQ ’ must have equal 
determinants. Therefore all members of a class have Д = 1 or all have 
Д = - 1. Hence rotations correspond to the number 1 or to the number - 1. 
The first are called direct rotations, the others are indirect. Kinematics proper 
deals with direct rotations only.
For a (direct) orthogonal matrix A we consider F(A) = | A - A11 = 0 which is 
an equation of the n'h degree for the scalar A, the characteristic equation of A. 
If we replace A by an equivalent matrix A', such that A' = QAQ"’, Q being an 
orthogonal matrix, we have A' - Al = QAQ 1 - Al = Q(A - AI)Q"‘, for matrix 
multiplication is distributive and QIQ
*
 = I. Therefore |A'-AI| = |A-AI|: 
the characteristic equations of two equivalent matrices are identical. If we 
write it out:
(3.1) F(A) = (—Л)" + c,(-A)"'1 + c2(—A)"”2+• • • + 
A)+1 = 0,
the coefficients cfc (k = 1,..., n - 1) are obviously invariants of A and the 
same holds for the zeros A, (/ = 1,..., и) of F(A), the eigenvalues of A. Cj is 
equal to Sart, the trace of A; ck is the sum of the (?) central minors of A of the 
k'1* order. But in view of the fundamental relations A‘, = AT, |A|= 1, the 
elements of A are equal to their own minors and each minor of the к,h order is 
equal to its complementary minor of order (n - k). This implies ck = ся-к 
(к = 1,..., л - 1). Hence (3.1) is a reciprocal equation: if A, is a root A/‘ is a 
root.
Assume that Ak is a root. This implies that the system of homogeneous 
linear equations with unknowns Xt

has a non-zero solution. That means that there is a point P, different from O, 
with the image point P', such that P' = AkP. In view of the fundamental 
property of a displacement (OP)2 = (OP')2 and therefore (OP)2 = Aj(OP)2.
There are two cases: if Ak is real then P is a real point, hence AI = 1 and a 
real eigenvalue of A is either equal to 1 or to - 1. When Ak = ± 1, eq. (3.2) 
yields a unique, real line, which is invariant under the rotation, called the 
axis of the rotation. If Ak is imaginary A i X 1, hence (OP)2 = 0, P and P' are 
imaginary and they lie on the same null-line (i.e., isotropic line) through O. 
This line coincides with its image and is therefore invariant for the rotation. 
Suppose that A = pe
*
 (p >0, ф/O, mod. тг) is a non-real eigenvalue and P 
an eigenvector, which means P' = (pe
**)P.
 Then if P - q + ih, q and h being 
real vectors, (P)2 = (P’)2 implies q2 = h2 = k2 and q • Л = 0. But as the 
characteristic equation has real coefficients pe"
**
 is another eigenvalue and 
we have R’ = (pe1*)/?,  R = q - ih. The plane W through P and R contains 
two different invariant lines and it is therefore an invariant plane (i.e., all the 
image points of W also lie in W). But W is obviously a real plane for it 
contains the real vectors q = i(P + R) and h = -Ji(P - R), which are further­
more orthogonal and of the same length k. Moreover if ^'corresponds to q,
q = 1(P' + R ) • lp(e

R)
 = Jp{e
*
 (q + ih) + e*
 (q - ih)}
~ p(q cos - h sin <p),
similarly h' = p(q sin <f> + h cos<p). From (q')2 = (q)2 it follows however that 
p = 1. Therefore: all eigenvalues Ak of an orthogonal matrix have the 
property jAk I = 1; if Ak is real it is either + 1 or - 1; if it is imaginary Ak = e*  
and the conjugate value e'1* (which is equal to A J1) is also an eigenvalue in 
accordance with the fact that the characteristic equation is a reciprocal one. 
Furthermore from the foregoing q' • q = Л' • h = k2cos<p, hence the displace­
ment within the invariant plane W is a planar rotation about О with the 
rotation angle
Let e^e"

eigenvalues, and Wt and W2 the real invariant planes corresponding to them.

 W3 contains vectors S and T such that S'=(e

Г = (e’*2)T. Then P' • S' = (e^^)P • S since P' • S' = P • S and / 1 
the conclusion is P • S = 0. In the same way we prove P T = 0, R • S = 0, 
R • T = 0. Hence the scalar product (knP + ki2R) • (k2iS + knT) - 0 for any 
set of numbers k4. But that means: each line in W, is orthogonal to each line in 
W2: the two planes are (absolutely) orthogonal. In the same way it is proved

that an invariant line, corresponding to a real eigenvalue, is orthogonal to all 
invariant planes.
Example 1. Show that for л = 3 the characteristic equation of A = ||ач Г reads AcA2 + cA - 1 = 
0, with c = <iи + an + aM. The eigenvalues are A = 1 and the roots of A2-(c - 1)A + 1 = 0; for 
the rotation angle we have “ arccos((c - 1 )/2). Show that the direction of the rotation axis is 
given by (в»+<!«)■':(вЭ1+ в1>Г':(ви+в,|)Л as well as (aM- a„): (л„- a,,): (a3, - al3).
4. Standard representations of a displacement
A direct rotation for which all eigenvalues are different will be called 
general. We introduce now a distinction which is fundamental for kinematics 
and which arises from the theory developed so far, namely n is even and n is 
odd. If n is even, n = 2m, the equation F(A) = 0 has (in general) no real root; 
there are m pairs of conjugate imaginary roots: e*** ‘ (k = 1,2,. ..,m). 
Hence there are m real invariant planes, all mutually orthogonal. We denote 
the n Cartesian coordinates of E" by X,, Уь...,Хт, Ym and choose our 
frame such that the invariant plane Wk corresponding to has the equations 
Xt = Y, = 0, i/ k. Hence the general rotation about О can be expressed in 
the canonical form
XL = Xk cos <pk - Yk sin
(4'1) 
YL = Xk sin <pk 4- Yk costpn, k = l,...,m,
that means: the general rotation is built up and determined by m planar 
rotations in m mutually orthogonal planes.
If n is odd, n = 2m 4-1, we have one real eigenvalue Л «1, and m pairs of 
conjugate imaginary e**
fc, k=l,...,m. The first corresponds to a real 
invariant line I, the others to m real invariant planes Wfc. We denote the 
coordinates by Xb Yl9..., Xm, Ут, Z, give 1 the equations X, = У, = 0 and Wk 
the equations X, = Y, = Z = 0 (iX к). The rotation is then given by
XL = Хк cos <pk - Yk sin
(4.2) 
YL = Хк sintpk + Yk cos^fc, k = l,...,m,
Z' = Z.
For n even there is in general no fixed point different from O, for n odd we 
have always at least a line 1 of fixed points, the “axis” of the rotation. In each 
(n - l)-dimensional space orthogonal to 1 and intersecting it at O' a general 
even dimensional rotation takes place about O'.

We do not want to discuss systematically the special cases which occur if the 
eigenvalues are not all different. In the canonical representation some <pk may 
be the same without changing the rotation essentially; the most special case in 
this respect is that for which all <pk are equal, the equal-angled rotation.
Other special cases occur if Л = 1 or Л = - 1 is a root for n = 2m; in both 
cases it is a double root. The consequence is the same as putting <pk = 0 or 
tpk = 77. In the first case all points of the corresponding plane Wk are fixed 
points, in the second we have a half-turn in Wfc. If for instance <pk = <p2 = 0, all 
points of the 4-space X, = Yt =■ 0 (i/ 1, i/ 2) are fixed points. Similar special 
cases appear for odd values of n.
We have seen earlier that a displacement can always be considered as the 
product of a rotation about a point O, chosen arbitrarily, and a translation. If 
О is replaced by a point O' and the frame at the latter is taken parallel to that 
at O, we see at once that the rotation part in both cases is essentially the same; 
therefore the coefficients ch the roots Ak, and the angles <pk are characteristic 
for the displacement. This means that a displacement can be expressed 
analytically by
X’k= Xk cos <pk — Yk sin (f>k + ak
(4’3) 
YL = Xk sin <pt + Yk cos <₽„ + bk
к = 1,2,...»m, for n = 2m. Here ak, bk are the components of the translation 
vector. For n = 2m 4-1 the representation reads
Xi = Xk cos (pk - Yk sin <pk 4- ak
(4.4) 
Yi = Xk sin (pk 4 Yk cos<pk 4 bk
Z’ = Z + Co
к = l,...,m; ak, hfc, cft, the components of the translation vector, vary with 
the choice of origin. We have for both cases
(4.5) 
P' = AP 4 d
A represents an orthogonal matrix (or more precisely: stands for a class of 
equivalent orthogonal matrices); P', P and d are column matrices.
The question whether a general displacement has fixed points is now seen 
to be answered differently for n = 2m and for n = 2m 4 1. In the first case the 
determinant of the n linear equations X'k = Xk, Yi = Yk is unequal to zero 
(because Л = 1 is not an eigenvalue) so these equations have a unique 
solution: in E2m a displacement has in general one fixed point and it is 
therefore a mere rotation; hence (4.1) is the standard representation for this

case. For n = 2m + 1 the determinant arising from XL = Xk, YL = Yk, Z' = Z 
is zero and no solution exists: in E2"*
1 a displacement has in general no fixed 
point. There is, however, an invariant direction 1. Hence any (n - l)-space 
perpendicular to it is displaced parallel to itself. But such a space has an even 
number of dimensions and its own displacement has an invariant point. We 
take this to be Xk = Yk = 0 (k = l,...,m). Hence the canonic form of a 
general displacement in E2**1 reads
(4.6) 
XL = Xk cos^k - Yk sin YJ = Xfc sin <pk + Ук cos фк, Z' = Z
and the displacement is seen to be a (generalized) screw displacement, built 
up by a rotation about axis l(Xk = Yk = 0) and a translation parallel to 1.
5. Cayley’s formula for an orthogonal matrix
A rotation about the origin О is given by
(5.1) 
P' = AP

ment we have (OP)2 = (6?% hence
P P -PP = 0

(P'-P)-(P' + P) = 0

We have (with f, g, and P in column matrix form):
(5.3) 
/ = (A-I)P, g = (A + I)P, /-g=0.
We exclude the special case that - 1 is an eigenvalue of A: then A 4-1 is a 
non-singular matrix and we have

it follows that
(5.5)

If В = ||frA || and if g, are the components of g then f g = 0 implies
£ (fr<*  + Ьк.)^ =0 
О
for any vector g. The conclusion is that b,k + 6^=0 for all i, k. Hence В is a 
skew matrix. From (5.4) it follows
A - I = B(A +1)
or
(5.6) 
(I-B)A = I+B
It is well-known that if В is a real skew matrix we have |B;^0, hence 
|B + AI| is a polynomial in A with non-negative coefficients and thus with no 
real zero’s different from A = 0. This implies that |B-1| / 0. The conclusion 
is that any orthogonal matrix, for which - 1 is not an eigenvalue, may be 
written as
(5.7) 
A = (bB)-(I+B)
in which В is skew; (5.7) is Cayley’s formula.
On the other hand, if in (5.7) В is any skew matrix we have (I - B)A = 14- В 
and therefore AT(I - B)T = (14- B)T, or AT(14- В) = I - B; hence AAT = 
(I - B) ’(14-B)(I-BXI4-B) 1 or, as the second and third factor may be 
interchanged, AAT = I which implies that A is an orthogonal matrix. The set of 
orthogonal matrices, (for which - 1 is not an eigenvalue) is identical with the 
set (I-B)-,(I4-В), В being skew.
Cayley has shown that the orthogonal matrices with an eigenvalue - 1 may 
be derived from (5.7) by a limit procedure.
We have found that there exists a (1,1) correspondence between or­
thogonal matrices and skew matrices. If В = || Ьл II is skew, ba = 0 and 
bkt = - blk for i > k. Hence В is determined if we know the elements blk for 
i > k. that is, all elements to one side of the main diagonal. Their number is 
Jn(n - 1). If В is known A may be found by formula (5.7). Hence the theorem: 
any orthogonal matrix in En may be written as a function of }n(n - 1) 
parameters.
Example 2. Show that for n -2m and for n - 2m + 1 the elements of an orthogonal matrix A in 
E" are rational functions of degree 2m of the parameters.

6. A displacement as the product of two reflections
We shall prove that a displacement in E" can always be written as the 
product of two displacements of a simple type, called reflections. Again we 
must distinguish between the cases n is even and n is odd.
Let л = 2m. We consider in E2m a linear subspace V of dimension m and 
derive from it a displacement by the following procedure. If P is any point, Q 
its orthogonal projection on V, P' the point on the extended line PQ such 
that QP'= P$, then (P-
*P
') is a displacement. That is easily verified by 
elementary geometry. The displacement is called the reflection into V.
If XhYi (i = 1,..,, m) are Cartesian coordinates in I", V can be given the 
equations Y, = 0 for all i, and then the reflection is expressed by
(6.1) 
Х; = ХЙ П=-К (U =
it is a direct displacement if m is even, indirect if m is odd. The square of a 
reflection is the unity displacement. We consider two m -spaces and V2 in 
E2m; 94, is the reflection with respect to V,. D = 
। is clearly a displacement
and moreover direct. In the general case Vi and V2 have one (finite) point of 
intersection O; it is clear that О is a fixed point of D: the product of two 
reflections is a rotation. There are several special cases: the intersection of V| 
and V2t may be a к -dimensional subspace (k = 1,2,..., m - 1). Another case 
is that for which they have their point of intersection at infinity: Vt and V2 are 
parallel and D is a translation; the direction of which is parallel to the Em 
absolutely orthogonal to both Vx and V2, and the magnitude is determined by 
the relative position of V, and V2.

In the general case, when V} and V2 intersect at one point O, л- 
dimensional Euclidean geometry teaches that they give rise to m, generally 
different, angles ak describing their mutual position. We state without proof 
that the m rotation angles of the rotation D satisfy the conditions ?» = 2а». 
It may be shown moreover that any rotation about О is the product of two 
reflections with respect to suitably chosen m dimensional spaces V| and V2 
through O, and, moreover, in ways.
In E2**1 we have similar theorems. Again a reflection takes place with 
respect to an m -space. If Vi and V2 are two m -spaces, 5И, the reflection in VJ 
then D = 
। is a (direct) displacement, but as Vj and V2 have in general no
intersection, it is not a rotation. Here again it may be shown that a general 
displacement may be written (in «j"** 1 ways) as the product of two reflections. 
We return to these theorems later on for л = 2 and n = 3, for which cases 
important consequences may be derived.
7. Indirect displacements
We consider the displacement of E":
(7.1) 
P  = AP + d
*
where A is an orthogonal matrix with determinant - 1; let A be general (all 
eigenvalues mutually different). It is easily verified that for all values of n, 
either even or odd, one of the eigenvalues is - 1. If the point P is displaced to 
P*  their midpoint M satisfies
(7.2) 
M = 1(P  + P) = J(A + I)P + U
*
but - 1 being an eigenvalue of A the determinant |A + I| is equal to zero. 
Hence for any P the coordinates of M satisfy the same linear equation. This 
implies that all mid-points M lie in a the subspace of E" coincident with 
2""1 is denoted by l/"’1. Obviously, if P is in I/*"
1 the same holds for P*;
 
hence I/""1 is an invariant (л - l)-space for the displacement. Without any 
loss of generality we may suppose the equation of Uto be Xn = 0. Then we 
have Xi = - Хя and the displacement of L/"”1 in itself is seen to be one with 
an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1 and therefore a direct displacement. 
The conclusion is: the displacement (7.1) is the product (with arbitrary order of 
its factors) of the reflection into Un~' and a direct displacement of E*  which is 
essentially а (л - l)-dimcnsional displacement induced by that in U”~'. A 
(л - l)-space parallel to Un~' is reflected into U*~

8. Transformations and operators
The equation for a general displacement (4.5) is of fundamental importance 
in kinematics, and as such will appear repeatedly in this book. The basic 
interpretation we use is:
(8.1) 
P' = AP+d
represents two operators A and d which change the n-dimensional position 
vector P into the n -dimensional position vector P'. We take the point P in a 
system En and measure all quantities relative to a reference system in S". All 
quantities in (8.1) are measured in a coordinate system fixed in J". However, 
in many applications it will be more useful to measure P in E". To accomplish 
this we select parallel coordinate systems in E" and X" with origins о and О 
respectively. We substitute P = p + Ooy and let d now represent the total 
displacement of point о (that is, d + A(Oo)—♦ d). The resulting equation can 
be written as follows
(8.2) 
P = Ap + d,
with the understanding that here p is measured in E" while all other 
quantities are still measured in JE". (We have dropped the prime from the left- 
hand-side, but here P has the same meaning as P' does in (8.1).
(8.2) suggests another interpretation for the operators A and d: If we have a 
vector p measured in an arbitrary system E", then A and d represent the 
elements of the coordinate transformation which transform the coordinate 
system of E" to the coordinate system of X". The only difference associated 
with the displacement or the coordinate transformation interpretation has to 
do with the algebraic sign associated with the sense of the rotation and 
translation. In this book we will henceforth interpret A and d as displacement 
operators unless explicitly stated otherwise.

about the origin of the system and then translated a, b, the coordinate transformation interpreta­
tion for this physical situation would imply that the coordinate axes of E2 have been translated 
- a. - b and rotated clockwise by an angle ф.
We will often deal with a series of displacements, i.e., we will start with En 
in one position say E? and then displace it to another, say EJ, and then say 
EJ, all relative to 2". To deal with this situation we will employ the 
nomenclature, for the displacement from position i to position /:
(8.3) 
P, = А.Л+Л,
where all quantities are measured in 2".
It is frequently convenient to define the operators A„ and relative to a 
secondary reference system JI. The result might be inferred from our 
discussion in Section 3, however we will develop it here in its more general 
context. We can rewrite (8.3) as
(8.4) 
P, = DVP,
if we use homogeneous coordinates for P, and P, and define Dt/ such that

If the system X" is itself displaced by D»

CHAPTER II
INSTANTANEOUS KINEMATICS
1. Definition of a motion
We have seen that a general displacement in n -space may be given 
analytically by
(1.1) 
P = Ap + d
in which P and p are the position vectors, represented by column matrices, of 
a point P in the fixed space 2" and the moving space En respectively; A is an 
orthogonal matrix and d a translation vector. If A and d are functions of a 
parameter r, which may be identified with the time, (1.1) gives us a continuous 
series of displacements, called a motion. Any point P of the moving space En 
describes a curve, its path, in the fixed space 2". We shall deal with the motion 
concept later on in detail, here we consider a special feature.
We consider a certain position of the moving space, given by t = 0 and 
restrict our study to the properties of the motion for the limit case t —>0. For 
any function F(r) we shall denote d‘F/dtfc at t = 0 by Fk. We have then: P« 
yields the position vector of the point P (in the zero position), P, is its velocity 
vector (which implies the tangent to the path), Pk for к =2 is its acceleration, 
from which follows the curvature of its path, and so on. As all theorems deal 
with one particular instant during the motion this subject is called instantane­
ous kinematics. It has developed into an important branch of our science. Of 
course it is easier to treat than the kinematics of motion proper. Moreover it 
gives rise to attractive results, which have furthered our insight into general 
motion, to which it is an approximation comparable with the Taylor expan­
sion of a function of one variable. We obtain information about a motion, at 
least during a certain period, if we know its characteristics for one instant. The 
value of the information is of course dependent on how much instantaneous 
knowledge is available, or to be more exact, to which order the derivatives of 
P are known. If Pk are given for к = 0,1,2,..., m, our subject is instantane­
ous kinematics of the m,h order.

A and d being functions of t means that the n2 elements of A and the n 
elements of d are functions of t in the usual sense. Without any loss of 
generality we may suppose that for t = 0 the origins in En and I" coincide, so 
that Ax, = I, do = 0. The elements of A may be expanded in Taylor series and 
this gives rise to the following expansion
(2.1) 
A(r) = 14- A|t + — А2Г2 + — А3Г5 + • • *
in which Afc (k = 1,2....) is a constant matrix. A(r) is orthogonal, which 
means that for all values of t we must have
AAT = I
or
(2.2) 
(I + A,/ + A,f2 + ■ ■ • W I + A[ / + j A} f2 + - - • ) = 1
for all t. Hence on the left-hand-side the coefficient of tk must vanish for 
к = 1,2,... . This gives us
A, + AT = 0
A2 + 2A|A[ + AT = 0
Ал+ЗА2АТ + ЗА,А1 +Al = 0
and in general
(2.3) 
к = 1.2,...
I-O \t /
with А», = A,T = I.
From the first equation it follows that A, is skew; we write Ai = Bt and 
therefore A{ = - B,. Bt denoting an (arbitrary) skew matrix. Then we have 
AjA[ = -C2 = ~ B;, C2 being symmetric. The second equation leads to 
A2 4- AT = 2Ca; hence if A2 = C2 4- B2 we have Al = C2 4- BT and therefore 
B2 4- Bl = 0, which means that B2 must be skew. The next step gives A.> 4- AT - 
3(B2Bi 4- BtB2) = 2Ci, C3 being symmetric. Therefore Аз = Сэ + Вз, A} = 
Сз + В? and Bt is skew.
By continuing the procedure we arrive (by induction) at the following 
result: the expansion of an orthogonal matrix A(t) in the neighborhood of the 
unit matrix reads

Example 2. If for n - 2 we have B*  = Ji ',M|. determine Сг,СъС4,Сч.
In view of the fundamental property AAT = I, the expansion of the inverse 
matrix follows at once from (2.4):
(2.6) 
А '(0=1+(С,-В,)/ + ^(С2-В2)Гг+---
Therefore: if Bk are the skew matrices determining a motion those of the 
inverse motion are Bk = — Bk.
So far we have only dealt with the rotation part of the motion (1.1). The 
translation part is much simpler for it is fully determined by the vector d(t). If 
the origins in E" and X" coincide and therefore do = 0 the expansion for a 
general motion is seen to be
(2.7) 
P = p + {B,p 4- d.}/ + J{(C2 + B2)p + d2}t2 + i{(C3 + B3)p + dy}t  + • • •

Pk = (Ck + Bk)p + dk
which for к = 1 gives us the velocity, for к =2 the acceleration and for к = m 
the (m - l)'h order acceleration of any point P of E" in the zero position.
As a counterpart of (2.7) we can also derive the expansion for the inverse 
motion. If we solve for p from (1.1) we obtain p = A~'(P- d) and therefore 
for P = 0:
p = -{I-B1r + l(C2-B2)t2+---}{dj + Jd2r2+--.},

3. The angular velocity matrix
Although (2.7) gives us a complete account of the behavior of the moving 
space in the neighborhood of t = 0, the apparatus developed so far is not 
always the most suitable for the study of instantaneous kinematics. A 
different approach shall be given now. We restrict ourselves for the time being 
to rotational motion, given by
(3.1) 
P = A(r)p.
From this follows the velocity vector of a point P of the moving space:
(3.2) 
P = A(r)p.
In the next step, which is essential for the new method, we eliminate p from 
(3.1) and (3.2) and use instead the position vector P, of the point, in the fixed 
space. We obtain
(3.3) 
P = AA'P.
(3.2) may be considered as the velocity as experienced by an observer who 
belongs to the moving space E", while (3.3) is that registered by a person at 
rest in the fixed space X" who sees the moving point passing. The two 
concepts are well-known in continuum mechanics where they are denoted, 
respectively, as the Lagrangian and the Eulerian view-point. The matrix AA-' 
which appears in (3.3) has an important property: Differentiating AAT = I we 
obtain
(3.4) 
AAT+A(AT)‘= 0.
In view of the general relation (М|М2)Т=МГМ} and the obvious property 
(MT)‘ = (M)T, the second term of (3.4) is equal to A(AT)‘ = (A~')T(A)T = 
(AA‘‘)T; since the first term is AA"' we conclude that this product is a skew 
matrix. We denote it by П, which means that (3.3) may be written
(3.5) 
P = ft(t)P
where the skew matrix fl is defined by

THE ANGULAR VELOCITY MATRIX 
21
(3.6) 
ft(f) = A(f)A-(r).
This matrix shall play an important part in the theory; it is called the angular 
velocity matrix.
Example 3. If A = |]a4 and П = 
[( show that 
= S»., d,baA.
If instead of (3.1) we consider the general motion P = Ap + d, we have 
P = Ap + d. or after eliminating p:
(3.7) 
P = ft(P-d)+d
This means that the combination (ft. d), which consists of a skew matrix and a 
vector, determines by its values at a certain moment, the velocity of all points 
(i.e., the so-called velocity distribution) at that moment.
From (3.7) we may answer the question whether there are, at a certain 
instant, points with velocity zero. To discuss this problem we must distinguish 
two cases: n is even or n is odd.
If n = 2m the skgw matrix ft is (restricting ourselves to the general case) 
not singular; hence ft 1 exists. Then from (3.7) and P = 0 it follows that
(3.8) 
P = d-ft‘d.
Hence in 2m -space there is in general at any moment one point with zero 
velocity. It is called the pole at that moment or the instantaneous rotation 
center. The formula (3.8) gives its position in the fixed space. From P = Ap + d 
it follows that its position in the moving space is given by
(3.9) 
p= -(A)-’d.
If in (3.8) and (3.9) t is considered variable, these formulas represent the locus 
of the pole in the fixed and the moving space; these curves are called the 
polhodes or the centrodes of the motion.
We restrict ourselves to the zero position, take the origins in E" and I" 
coinciding (which implies da = 0) and located at the pole (which gives us by 
(3.8) or (3.9) that d} = 0). Then from (3.7):
(3.10) 
P1 = ftoP0=ftnp
represents the instantaneous velocity distribution with respect to the chosen 
origin, in 2m -space. To write ft0 in a standard form we make use of the same 
Cartesian frame chosen in Chapter I (in connection with (4.1)). If <f>k are 
functions of t and if фк (0) is denoted by we obtain

which expresses the velocity distribution by means of the angular velocities 
(k = 1,2.......m) of the tn invariant planes through O.
In a space with an odd number of dimensions the situation is different and 
less symmetric. A skew (2m + 1) x (2m + 1) matrix 11 is always singular. This 
implies that the equation P = 0 which follows from (3.7) has in general no 
solution: in (2m + l)-space there is in general no point with zero velocity. To 
discuss this problem we consider first a motion with d = 0. Then P = 0 if 
HP = 0, П being singular; the conclusion is (supposing that the rank of fl is 
not less than 2m) that there exists a line I through the origin all of whose 
points have a zero velocity. This implies that any point not on 1 has a velocity 
vector perpendicular to I; in any E2m perpendicular to 1 any point has a 
velocity vector lying in this space; the velocity distribution in such a space is of 
the type described before. The 2m -space as a whole does not move. Now we 
add a translation part d as the motion of the origin. There are two cases: di 
has a non-zero component parallel to I, which is the general case, or d, is 
perpendicular to I, this being a special case. In the general case the velocity of 
a point P has two components: one is the sum of the rotation and translation 
in the 2m-space through P perpendicular to I and the second is parallel to I, 
the latter being the same for all points P. Furthermore, if we choose the origin 
at the pole of the 2m -space the line I will pass through it, and the rotation and 
translation in the 2m -space becomes simply a pure rotation.
Example 4. Derive from formula (4.2) in Chapter 1 a standard representation of the velocity 
distribution in a 2m + I-space.
The theorems on the velocity distribution are obviously limit cases of those 
considered in Chapter I, where two finitely separated positions of a moving 
space were studied. In the situation at hand the two positions coincide but the 
direction of approach is known; they are said to be infinitesimally separated, 
sometimes also denoted by the term “two consecutive positions”.

Cl, the angular velocity matrix of the inverse motion, is (A ’)'A and it is easy 
to see that it follows from П by writing - Bfc instead of Bk for any index k. 
Therefore, we obtain fh =

4. The case n = 3
All results derived so far are valid in a space with an arbitrary number of 
dimensions. For the remainder of this chapter, we shall confine ourselves to 
the case л = 3, called spatial kinematics (the case л = 2, planar kinematics, is 
an important subcase, which will as a matter of fact also be developed 
autonomously in Chapter VIII).
The restriction to three-dimensional space is of course in the first place 
justified by its relation to the physical world. It is remarkable, however, that 
the analytics contain a certain elegance which does not exist for higher values 
of л.
For л = 3 the number of independent elements of the skew matrix П is 
equal to three and if we write it as follows

we may fix a correspondence between П and the vector with Cartesian 
components (Пх, fly,Dz) which we shall denote by Л. If (p„pv,pf) are the 
elements of the column vector p we have
Пр =
CIyPz ~~ 
ftzp, “ Пхр« 
Oxpy - nvp.
Therefore we have an equivalence between the matrix multiplication and the 
vector product:
(4.2) 
fip = П xp,
and this makes it possible to treat spatial kinematics by means of vector 
algebra. For n >3 this is not true: a skew matrix (with }n(n ~ 1) elements) 
does not correspond to a vector and we need instead tensor algebra. For 
n = 2, П reduces essentially to a scalar.
The vector corresponding to the 3 x 3 skew matrix Bfc will be denoted by bk.
We mention some rules for this equivalent vector. They can easily be 
verified by means of the well-known formula
(4.3) 
t>| x (t>2 x ©,) = (©J • ©з)©2 - (©, • ©2)t>3.
We have
(4.4) 
BtB2p = bt x (b2 x p) = (bi • p )b2 - (bi • b2)p.
Example 6. Show that (B,B2 - B;B,)p « (b( x b2) x p.
Example 7. Show that B’p = - b’p + (b-p)b, B’p * - b’(b x p), and more generally B2“’p « 
(- l)fcb2k (b x p), B"p - (- l)* ”b2‘"2(- b’p + (bp)b).
Obviously the multiplication of a column matrix (i.e., a vector) by a matrix 
which is given as a polynomial of skew matrices can always be written by 
means of vector and scalar products. This is especially true for the matrices Cfc 
of Section 2, which, as we have seen, are polynomials of Bt,B2,...,Bk l.
This implies that the expansion (2.7) may be written in terms of the 
arbitrary vectors bk and dk. By means of (4.4), Example 1, and Example 7 we 
obtain

This implies that b, is the angular velocity vector at the zero position and b2 
the angular acceleration; thus a kinematical interpretation of these two 
vectors has been derived.
We return now to (3.7). Obviously in three-dimensional space it may be 
written
(4.7) 
P = Л x(P-d)4-d.
If for t = 0 the origins in E3 and I3 coincide, we have Po = p and d0 = 0, and 
therefore
(4.8) 
P, = noxp + di.
If instead of О we choose the common origin at O' such that OO’ = <, (using 
primes to denote the new position vectors) we have P = P' + e, p = p' + e and 
thus
(4.9) 
p; = По x p14- d, 4- Qo X e
which shows that По is independent of the chosen origin. This is not true for 
the translation part: we have d\ = d\ 4- Лох e.
Formula (4.7) confirms that there is in general no point with zero velocity: 
since flx(P-d) is orthogonal to П this would require П and d to be 
mutually orthogonal. This latter condition is necessary and also sufficient. Let 
П-d = 0; consider the point p = Л02(Л0х dj, its velocity is according to 
(4.8) equal to Л 02По x (Ло x d,)4- d, and this is after reduction by means of 
(4.3) seen to be zero.
In the general case, when no such a point exists, we may ask for those 
points with velocity parallel to П. Such points satisfy
(4.10) 
Л x(P-d)+d = aQ,
a being a scalar. Scalar multiplication of both sides by П yields
(4.11)

from vector algebra that the equation a x x = b, with a • b = 0 has the set of 
solutions x = - a~2(a * b)+ pa, p. being an arbitrary scalar. Hence the 
solutions of (4.12) are
(4.13) 
Р = а + ГГ2(Л x d)+Mn
which means that there exists at any instant a line s in space, parallel to П, 
which is the locus of points whose velocity is parallel to Д. If S is any point on 
s we have from (4.12): П x (S - d) = afl - d and then from (4.7)
(4.14) 
P = fl x(P-S)+afl
which expresses that at any instant the velocity distribution is identical with 
that of a screw motion, with s as its axis, with angular velocity Л and 
translation velocity afl. The scalar a being the ratio of the linear and the 
angular velocity, is known as the pitch of the screw motion. It must be 
understood that here, unlike in Chapter I, s, fl, and a belong to a certain 
instant (in other words that they are functions of t).
The screw axis s is given by (4.13): all P from this equation are position 
vectors 5, (jl being a parameter. This is not the most suitable way to handle it. 
We shall make use of the method by which in line geometry the position of a 
line is described: One takes an arbitrary vector Q along the line and 
determines the moment Q' of Q with respect to the origin, this is the vector 
S x Q where S is the position vector of any point on the line. It is well-known 
that the line is uniquely determined by the ordered pair of (free) vectors Q 
and/ <?'; the first gives it geometric direction and the other contains the 
location. Obviously all pairs kQ, kQ', к being an arbitrary scalar, unequal to 
zero, describe one and the same line. Moreover the two vectors must satisfy 
the relation (?•(?' = 0. The components of Q and Q' are the homogeneous 
Cartesian Pliicker coordinates of the line. We shall call Q, Q' its Pliicker 
vectors.
Example 8. 
If (x,. x2,xb x4) and (у,,y2, y>, У«) are the homogeneous Cartesian coordinates of 
two different points on a line and х^-х^у, is denoted by q^ show that Q •

Q'=

Example 9. 
Alternatively, if the second Pliicker vector is Q' « Q x S, show that Q' remains as 
Q' = (<?z>>qn,qi2) provided that now Q ~ (qi4, qz
.  (The nomenclature Q(Qi, O2,O>), 
Q'(Q{, Qi, Qt) will frequently be used instead of the double subscripts, in which case we will note 
which system is indicated.)

(4.16) 
(? = П, Q =d- П xd-аП,

The velocity distribution at a certain instant is determined by the screw-axis 
s, the vector П along s, and the pitch a. It may be represented by a pair of 
ordered vectors L, M defined as follows
(4.17) 
L=Oy M = Q'+afi,
Q‘ being the second Pliicker vector of the line s. L and M determine the 
distribution (or “the infinitesimal screw motion”) uniquely. Indeed, we have 
D=L and L-M = aL2 and hence a = (L *M  )/L2. Furthermore Q’= 
M - trLy which gives us the position of s. From (4.14) it follows then (in view 
of S x П = Q'):
(4.18) 
P = LxP + M.
Example 13. If L *M  » 0 the screw motion is a pure rotation.
The (independent) vectors L and M may be called the Ball vectors of the 
infinitesimal screw. Sir Robert Ball, in his classic treatise (Ball (1900]) deals 
with geometrical properties of sets of infinitesimal screws and their applica­
tions to dynamics.

First of all we suppose, as we did before, that the origins of the fixed and the 
moving space coincide in the zero position. This implies do = 0 and Po = p
Furthermore we take this common origin on the screw axis So of the zero 
position. The consequences are: dx = <т0Л0, Pi = Ло x p + <т0Ло, the Plucker 
vectors of So are (?0 = Ло, Q'o - 0.
For a definite choice of О on So we determine the common perpendicular n 
of So and s(r) in its limit position for t —>0. In order to study the behavior of 
s(/) for small values of t we expand its Plucker vectors in a power series,

have
(5.2) 
N = Ло x (Ло + Л,/) = (Ло x Л,)/.
We exclude the special case Лох Л| = 0, which would mean that So and s(t) 
are, to the first order, parallel.
So and n intersect, according to (4.15), if

or in view of (5.2) and (5.3), dividing N and N' by t:

The limit of the common perpendicular n is implicitly determined by (5.4), by 
N - (Ло x Л|), and by N •N1 = 0. It intersects So at a point So which is called 
the striction point on So with respect to the ruled surface which is the locus of 
s(r). We choose the origin at So, which implies N' = 0. Hence (5.4) gives us as 
a consequence
(5.5) 
Л-(Лох Л,) = 0
which means that d2 is linearly dependent on Ло and Ль

two sets of arbitrarily chosen vectors: bk (k = 1,2,...) and (к = 0,1,2,...). 
The first set was related to only the rotational part of the motion. When we 
changed our choice of origin to the canonical origin the first set remained the 
same, which could have been expected because we have seen that the 
pertinent vector Л(г) is independent of the origin. The second set does 
however depend upon our choice of origin. For the canonical system we 
obtained three relations:

and Hi, По

 Hi is perpendicular to this plane (and along the common

Fig. 1 it seems suitable to use a frame simply connected with the configura­
tion. We take Oz along По; the plane of По, Л i and d2 as X = 0, and Ox 
along - Лох Л,. Then we have:
P = (X, У,Z), p = (x, y, z), by = По = (0,0, w), b2 = nt = (0, Ey,Ez), 
(5’9) 
d\ = (0,0, (Toto), d2 = (0, ДЕу, Aco + ДЕг),
and for (4.5) we obtain
Xo = X, 
X1 = - coy, X2 = “ O)2x - Ezy + EyZ,
Уо = У, У1 = ШХ, 
Y1 = ezx - ыгу +

Z0 = Z, 
Z1 = CToCO, 
Z2 = - EyX 4- A(O 4- ДЕг,

Уз = yzX - 3o)Ezy + (J WE У - yx)z 4- d3y9
Z3= ~ yYx + (iwEy + yx)y +
These formulas may be considered as fundamental for the study of instan­
taneous kinematics (up to the third order). As the frame is canonical the 
constants appearing in (5.10) are characteristic of the motion, they are called 
its (kinematical) instantaneous invariants: For the first order there are two, ш

second order, eY, e*  Л, д, which together with w determine the acceleration 
distribution. Third order invariants (yx, yY, yz. d^ dy^ d^) are six in number, 
and the same holds obviously for any order >3.
Formulas like (5.10) were first derived, for spatial kinematics, by Veldkamp 
[1967а].

In order to derive the instantaneous invariants for the inverse motion we 
remark that for a 3-dimensional space the formulas (3.15) read

Hence, if the frame for the direct motion is canonical, we have d2 = - d2. This 
implies that the inverse and the direct motion have the same screw axis and 
the same canonical origin, and that furthermore the canonical frame O
*tt
 
follows from Oxyz by reflection into Ox- This implies that the instantaneous 
invariants of the inverse motion (with respect to its own canonical frame) of 
the first and the second order are the same as for the direct motion. From 
(5.12) and (5.13) it follows that this is not true for higher order invariants.

Determine the third order invariants of the inverse motion in terms of those of the

value of the parameter ty which was meant to be the time, as measured by a 
clock. It is of course possible for two motions Mx and M2 to have the same 
positions of E but have different time schemes associated with them. In this 
case Mi and M2 have different properties: for instance at the same position 
the velocity and the acceleration of a certain point of E will in general be 
different for the two motions. On the other hand it is obvious that there are 
other characteristics which are the same for them: the path of 2ny point is 
identical for the two motions and it follows that the path’s geometrical 
properties (tangents, curvatures, etc.) are the same for both. These remarks 
give rise to a certain classification in kinematics: there are properties, to be 
called time-independent, which regardless of the time scheme remain unal­
tered provided only that the same set of positions is travelled through; their 
study is the subject of geometric kinematics. Other properties are time- 
dependent: they are related to the particular time scheme of the motion.
Example 17. Show that the instantaneous screw axis and (he pitch are time-independent 
concepts; if the time scheme is changed the angular velocity vector is multiplied by a scalar.
In geometric kinematics the parameter actually being made use of is 
irrelevant and we are free to choose it in a way to simplify the analytic 
description of the motion. The possibilities are, however, rather restricted. 
Because the parameter is a scalar the freedom of choice can only enable us to 
normalize a scalar function related to the motion, while the motion itself is a 
phenomenon mainly described by vectorial means.
We cannot use some of the scalars which characterize the lower order 
properties of a motion: the pitch cannot be used because it is immune to 
parameter transformation; if we take the length of d we exclude the 
important spherical motions which require d = 0. The only acceptable choice 
seems to be to normalize the length Q of the angular velocity vector, which is 
in accordance with the developments of this chapter where we supposed Л to 
be unequal to zero. Therefore we introduce for geometric kinematics a 
parameter, say ф, such that Л(ф) is normalized so that El = 1. As a 
consequence we have the infinite series of relations

The number of data which needs to be taken into consideration in order to 
study the k’h order properties of geometric instantaneous kinematics is 1 for 
к = 1, 4 for к = 2, 9 for к = 3, and in general (5k -6) for к > 1. Time­
dependent instantaneous kinematics requires 2 numbers for к = 1, and 6k - 7 
for к >1. It is obvious that although our method is applicable for all k, 
practical reasons restrict the investigation to a low order. It may be said that 
the study of general spatial kinematics has been concentrated mainly on 
second order properties and that the knowledge about this restricted subject 
is satisfactory but by no means complete. Higher order investigations have 
rarely been made systematically except for special cases such as spherical and 
planar motion.
The results of this chapter will be applied in Chapter VI to continuous 
kinematics, and also in Chapter III—V to m -positions theory (m = 2,3,4); the 
special case of m consecutive (or infinitesimally separated) positions is 
identical with instantaneous kinematics of the (m - l),h order. This approach 
will furnish us rather simple examples for concepts and theorems of general 
(m - l)’h order theory.

CHAPTER III
TWO POSITIONS THEORY
1. The displacement
We consider two positions of a three dimensional space E with respect to a 
fixed space J. The positions of E will be denoted by El and E2 respectively. 
The positions in £ of points A, B,... of E will be A b Bt,... when E is at Eb 
and A2,B2t... when E is at E2; those of lines i,m,... are lhmi,... and 
lj,nh,...; the two positions in 2 of planes a,0,... of E are ab0i,... and 
a2, 0ъ • • * .
At and A2 are called homologous points» lt and l2 are homologous lines, a> 
and a2 homologous planes. In this chapter we study relationships between 
homologous elements. Our methods are mainly algebraic; the subject was 
originally developed using (mainly) geometrical reasoning (by Chasles [1831], 
Brisse [1875], Schoenflies [1892], and others).
As shown in Chapter I, Section 4, the transformation E> —► E2 can always be 
generated by a unique screw displacement in 1. If s is the screw axis, the 
displacement is the product (in an arbitrary order) of a rotation of angle ф 
about s and a translation of distance d parallel to s.
In order to describe the displacement analytically we take a Cartesian 
frame Oxvz in £ such that Oz coincides with s, the origin О and the axes Ox 
and Ov are arbitrary. In E we take a Cartesian frame oiyi such that the two 
frames coincide in the first position. Hence if the coordinates of A in E are 
(x,y,z) we have for At and A2 respectively
(1.1) 
X. = x, Y. = y, Z, = z
and
(1.2) 
X2 = x cos ф - у sin ф, Y2 = x sin ф + у cos ф. Z2 = z + 
Let h be the line X sin у - Y cos у = Z - a = 0, intersecting the screw axis 
orthogonally at the point H(0,0, a). The projection of (X, Y, Z) on h is seen

and its reflection with respect to h is
(1.3) 
X' = X cos2y + Y sin 2y, Y'= X sin2y - Yeos2y, Z'=-
which verifies that the reflection is a direct displacement; namely, the half 
turn about h. Let Rt (i = 1,2) be the reflection with respect to h.: X sin yt - 
Y cos y, = Z - д, = 0. For the product R2Ri we obtain
X" = X' cos 2y2 + Y' sin 2y2 = X cos2(y2 - yt) - Y sin 2(y2 - y0,
(1.4) 
Y" = X' sin 2y2 - Y' cos2y2 = X sin 2(y2 - y,) + Y cos2(y2 - y.
Z" = -Z' + 2a2 = Z + 2(a2-a,),
which when compared with (1.2) proves that R2Ri is the screw displacement 
with ф = 2(y2 - yi), d = 2(a2-at); the rotation angle is twice the angle 
between hi and h2, the translation is twice the distance HiH2.
On the other hand the screw displacement may be written in a>2 many ways 
as the product, in the correct order, of two reflections with respect to lines 
intersecting the screw axis orthogonally. The parameters yt and Oi for one of 
the two lines (hbh2) may be chosen arbitrarily. We shall make use of this 
decomposition of a screw displacement in Chapter IV.
2. Homologous points
Pairs of homologous points At and A2 are given by (1.1) and (1.2). The 
midpoint M of A,A2 plays an important part in the theory. Its coordinates are 
seen to be
XM =Jx(1 + cos4>)-\y sin<£, YM = Jx sin<£+ }y (1 + cos<£),
(21) =
and its distance p to the screw axis is
(2.2) 
p2 = X2„ + Y2m= (x2 + y2)cos2(2<£).
On the other hand we have for the distance between At and A2
(AtA^ = 4(x2+ y2)sin2(J</>) + d2t
and therefore, if Ф/ it,
(2.3) 
(AlA2)a= 4p2tan2(J<£)+ d2.

THE COMPLEX OF LINES JOINING HOMOLOGOUS POINTS
37
The formulas (2.1) show that M is obtained from A, by a linear transforma­
tion, which is non-singular if ф/ тг. In that case the inverse transformation 
exists and we find: an arbitrary point M is the midpoint of a unique pair of 
homologous points, namely
А ь XM + Ym ten 1 </>, “ Хм tan $ ф + Ym, Zm “id, 
(2 4) 
A2: XM-YM tan XM tan 12ф + YM. ZM + U
If, however, ф = тг, which means that the rotation part of the screw 
displacement is a half turn, all points M are on the screw axis and each is the 
midpoint of pairs.
3. The complex of lines joining homologous points
Supposing that the screw displacement is not a pure rotation, which means 
d/ 0, it has no finite fixed points, and therefore A । and A 2 are distinct and the 
line A)A2 is well-defined. We investigate the locus of the line joining Ai and 
A2, the so-called join AjA2. The Pliicker coordinates of a join follow from 
(1.1) and (1.2). If the Pliicker vectors are denoted as (?(Oi, O2, Оз), 
<?Ч0ь O2, Qy) and satisfy the fundamental relation
(3.i) 
q.q: + q2q2+cm2; = o,
we obtain, (using the definition given in Chapter II, Example 9),
(2j = x(l - cos$)+ у sin ф, 
O! = - xz sin ф + yz(l — cos<f>) + yd

Q2 = - x sin ф + y(l - cos<£), Q2 = - xz(l - cos<£)~ yz sin

which gives the set of joins in terms of the three parameters x, y, z. To 
eliminate these we use QJQ

 QJQy and Q'JQy which leads to three 
equations for x and у only. The first two are linear; they give
2Q3x = d(-Qx + (?2cotJd>),
(33) 
2Q,y = d(-Q,cotj<^ - О.),
and thus
4Q?(x2 + у 2)sin2 (J ф) = d\Q\ + QI).
From this it follows, if Ф/ тг,

Hence the joins AXA2 belong to a quadratic line complex C. On the other hand, 
if (<?♦<?') is a line satisfying (3.4) and if ОлИО, the x, у coordinates of Ax 
follow from (3.3). The coordinate z may be found from Q'JQi which gives us 
a linear equation for z. The derivation is however somewhat simpler if we 
calculate the coordinates of AXA2 by means of (2.4), supposing Ф/ ir. We 
obtain then

(3.6) 
ZM = J0r'(02d соЦф - 209 = J07'(- O.d сойф + 20!)
= МО1О9’(о.оно2о;м соНф,
the three answers for ZM being equal in view of (3.1) and (3.4). It follows from 
this that each line satisfying (3.4) is a join AXA2, the midpoint of the two 
homologous points being given by (3.6). The complex C is therefore indeed 
the locus of the lines joining Ax and A2. It is a complex in 2.
As may be seen from its equation (3.4), the complex C is invariant for any 
rotation about s and for any translation parallel to s: it has complete screw 
symmetry about s. This follows also from the fact that the origin О and the 
axes Ox, Oy have been chosen arbitrarily and that the equation of C does not 
depend on these choices.
The lines of a quadratic complex passing through a given point are the 
generators of a quadratic cone. Those points for which the cone is degenerate 
constitute the singularity surface of the complex. It is well-known that this 
surface is of the fourth order. To determine it in our case we use homogene­
ous coordinates, and intersect the cone with vertex at T(X0, Уо, Zo, Wo) with a 
plane, Z = 0 say. All the lines on the cone are the join of T with the point 
(X, У, O, W). We derive the condition that these lines belong to C. We have
Q, = XoW-WoX, Q2=yoW-W0y, <?3=Z0W, О5=ХоУ-УоХ, 
and it follows that the conic in Z = 0 has the equation
W%X2 + У2) - 2(X0 Wo + aYnZo)XW
- 2( Yo Wo - aX0Z0) YW + (Xi + Yji) W3 = 0,

with a = d’’tanj<£. Its discriminant reads a2(Xj+ Yl)ZiWl. If Zo = 0 the 
vertex T is in the plane Z = 0 and the cone is in general not degenerate. 
Therefore: the singularity surface of C consists of the plane at infinity 
(counted twice since W2 = 0) and the two isotropic planes X + iY = 0, 
X-iY = 0 through the screw axis. The configuration is of course screw 
symmetric about s.
If the singularity surface of a quadratic complex degenerates into four 
planes it is called tetrahedral. Hence C is a tetrahedral complex. It is a special 
type within its class, because two of the four planes coincide. If T is on s the 
cone degenerates into the isotropic planes through s. If T is a point of the 
plane V at infinity (that is if = 0) the cone consists of the plane V and the 
plane -2aZo(YoX-X0Y) +(Xo+Yj)W = 0, parallel to s. For a general 
point T (3.7) is a circle, which means that all planes orthogonal to s intersect 
the cones of the complex in circles.
4. Normal planes
We have investigated the lines A}A2 in 1 which join two homologous 
points. Another geometric entity related to Ar, A2 and of importance for the 
theory of displacements is the normal plane 0: the plane through the midpoint 
M of Ai,A2 and perpendicular to the line AfA2.
The direction of AtA2 in terms of the coordinates of M follows from (2.4) 
and is seen to be
(4.1) 
2YMtanJ<f>: -2XMtanJ<£: - d.
Therefore the equation of the normal plane through M (XM, YM,ZM, WM) 
reads
(4.2) 
X(2 YM tan J ф) - Y(2XM tan J <f>) - ZW„d + WZ„d = 0.
The coordinates, l/h of the normal plane are seen to be linear functions of the 
coordinates of M;
l/, = 2 YM tan 
(J2 = -2XMtan}<k
(4,3) 
1/,= -^. 
U. = Z»d,
which means that the relation M —► p is a correlation; as M and p are incident

A plane of E is given by the equation Mix + u2y + uyz + u4 = 0, its plane

X = x соьф - у sin фу Y = x sin 4> + у cos<£, Z = z + d,
it follows
x = X cost/) 4- Y sin фу у = - X sin ф + Y cos<£, z = Z - d.
Hence the plane u, has in 2 the equation
(utcos<£ - u2sin<£)X + (u, sin<£ 4- u2cos<£) Y 4- uyZ + (- u3d 4- u4) = 0.
Therefore, if Ut are the plane coordinates in 2, planes are transformed as 
follows
Ui = UiCos</> - u2sin<£, U2 = Ui sin$ 4- u2cos0,

(Л=и,, 
U,= -u,d + u,.

Equation (5.2) for homologous planes is the equation analogous to (1.1) and 
(1.2) for homologous points.
The angles of on and a2 with s are equal ([тг/2] - arccos[u3/(u?4- u2 + u5),/2] 
in this case, as could be expected). If у denotes this angle, we find that the 
angle ф between a! and a2 is
(5.3) 
sin} ф = cos у sin 1 ф,
aI and a2 coincide only for the two isotropic planes through s and for the 
plane at infinity, these three planes being the fixed planes of the displacement; 
он and a2 are only parallel if they are perpendicular to s. In general on and a2 
have a line of intersection: (aba2). We investigate the set of these lines. Their 
Pliicker coordinates follow from (5.2) and are seen to be

that is again the equation of C. Hence the set of joins of homologous points 
A,, A2 coincides with the set of the lines of intersection (<Xi,a2) of homologous 
planes. That the two loci must be identical may be seen directly as follows. Let 
At and A2 be two homologous points. A, coincides with a point B2 of E2y 
homologous with of Et. On the other hand A2 coincides with a point Ci of 
Ei, the homologous point of which is C2. Since the lines AiG and A2B2 
coincide they are the intersection of the planes through А«В|С» and A2B2C2- 
The conclusion is that the plane B2A2C2 of E2 is homologous with the plane 
BiAiG of Ef; the intersection of these homologous planes is A\A2.
We have arrived at the conclusion that on any line of the complex C lie two 
homologous points A t and A2 and that two homologous planes a, and a2 pass

coordinates of the midpoint M on it. The Pliicker vectors of the line are then 
determined by (3.5) and the two homologous points A, and A2 by (2.4). In 
order to find the two homologous planes through it we proceed as follows, a, 
contains Bi, Аь A2 and it passes therefore through the following three points 
as well: the midpoint M of A|A2 (with coordinates XM, YMyZM)y the point at 
infinity of AtA2 (with coordinates 2YM tanj<k -2XM tan!^, - d, 0, in view 
of (2.4)) and the midpoint of BtB2 (which is the point in Ei to which M taken 
as a point in E2 is homologous, such that its coordinates are Хмсоьф + 
YM sin ф, -XMsin</> + YM cos ф, ZM - d). For the plane a through these 
points we find the coordinates
(XM-Ym cot ld>)d, (XMcotJ<£ + Y„)d, -2(X2M+Y2M), 
(5'6) 
(№„+Y2M)(2ZM-d).
a2 is the plane through AjA2 and the midpoint of CC2, which is the point in 
E2 homologous with M taken as a point in Et, and thus (Хм соьф — YM sin<£,

(№„+Y2M)(2ZM + d).
It may be verified by means of (3.5) that a( and a2 as given by equations (5.6) 
and (5.7) do intersect in the join AiA2 and hence are homologous.

The midpoint plane
If A ,, Bt, Ci are three non-collinear points of a plane on any point P} of a, is 
linearly dependent on them; P2 on a2 is linearly dependent on A2,B2,C2. 
Therefore the midpoint of P,P2 is linearly dependent on the midpoints of 
AiA2, BiB2 and C|C2. Hence, if we consider all points Pi on ab the locus of 
the midpoints of the displacement vectors PtP2 is a plane. We shall call it the 
midpoint plane of the homologous planes a> and a2; it will be denoted by p 
and its coordinates by Д1,р2,рл, p4.
Let ой be the plane (м>, м2, м3, m4) and suppose for the time being that no 
coordinate is zero. Then if
(6.1) 
A, = (- м4мГ',0,0), B, = (0, - м4и Д 0), C, = (0,0, - и4и>')

C2 = (0,0, - m4m J1 + J,).
The homogeneous coordinates of the midpoints of A(A2, B}B2, C|C2 (with 
Ф1 = 2ф, di = 2d) follow from (6.1) and (6.2):
(- m4cos2 ф, - u4sin ф соъф, и id, ut),
(6.3) 
(m4 sin ф cos ф, - u4 cos2 ф, u2d, u2),
(0,0, - u4 + Uid, Mj).
Hence (in view of mJcos<6/ 0) we obtain for the coordinates of the midpoint 
plane p:
pi = Mi соьф - M2sin ф, p2 = Mi sin ф + m2cos<6,

it can be easily verified that the same formulas hold for the planes on excluded

From (6.4) it follows that, if p. is given, the planes on and a2 are respectively

The conclusion is: any plane ц, in space, is the midpoint plane of one pair of 
homologous planes aHa2. A pair of homologous planes may be represented 
by its midpoint plane in the same way as a pair of homologous points is by its 
midpoint (2.4.)
From (6.5) follow the planes p = on 4- a2, p' = on - on:
P : p। cosф, д2со5ф, ру/созф, /x4/cos0,

P':g2sin<£, — д । sin ф, 0, M3d/cosф.
P and p' pass through the intersection of on and on; they are harmonically 
conjugated with respect to on, on and they are moreover mutually orthogonal. 
Hence p and P' are the bisector planes of on, on.
Example 1. Show that is parallel to the screw axis s.
Example 2. И ц is orthogonal to s show that 0 coincides with p. and 0' coincides with the plane 
at infinity.
The coordinates of the intersection of on, a2 in terms of pt follow from (6.5), 
or more easily from (6.6). We obtain

the following situation. Any point M of 1 is the midpoint of a displacement 
vector A|A2. The line AiA2 belongs to the complex C. Through it pass two 
homologous planes on, on, their midpoint plane being д. Obviously p passes

Two points (x, y, z, w) and (x у \ zw') of a line 1 are transformed by the 
screw displacement into
x cos </> - у sin ф, x sin ф + у cos ф, z + dw, w
x' cosф - у'sin ф, x'sin ф + у'cosф, z*  + dw', w', 
which enables us to calculate the Pliicker coordinates in £ of the line !((?, (?')

and
(7.7)

Those lines b which are intersected by their homologous line b satisfy 1 = 0,

(7.8)

This equation has already appeared in this chapter: as that of the lines in X 
joining two homologous points (3.4), and as that of the lines of intersection of 
two homologous planes (5.5) (and also (6.8)). It follows that (7.8) represents a 
tetrahedral complex Ct in Eb which coincides with the complex C in X; the 
homologous configuration of Ci is the complex C2 which also coincides with C.
The identity of the three sets of lines may be shown directly. Let h and b be 
two homologous lines intersecting at the point R; this is a point of E2y A2 say, 
which is the point homologous to A । on lb hence line I( coincides with the join 
AiA2. On the other hand R is a point B, of Eb its homologous point B2 is on 
b and therefore the line b coincides with the join BtB2. Inversely if we have a 
join AtA2 and consider it as h its homologous line b passes through A2 
intersecting 1( at this point.
From this argument it follows, that through any point R of J pass two 
homologous lines; we now determine the plane a(R) containing them. Let R 
be the point (X, Y, Z, W). Considered as a point A, of Ei it has the 
homologous point

The plane a(R) passes through R. A2 and 8, and therefore through R and

Y sin ф, - X sin ф, - dW, 0.
Hence its plane coordinates are
Ui = dYW2, U2 = - dXW\ U, = (X2 + Y2) W sin Ф,
(7,9) 
1Л = - (№ + Y2)Z sin ф.
This establishes a cubic relationship between any point R and the plane a(R) 
through it, which contains the two homologous lines intersecting at R. The 
relationship is biralional for from (7.9) follows the inverse relation
X = dU2U^ Y= -dUiUl, Z = (L/f+UOUsin</>,

W= -(U2,+ L^)l/,sin4>.
Hence each plane of S contains two intersecting homologous lines.
8. The linear complex Г'
Equations (7.9) establish that each point R of J is associated with the plane 
a(R) through R. The direction of n, the line normal to a(R) at R. is:
dYW: -dXW: (X2 + y2)sin</>,
hence the Pliicker coordinates of n are

showing that each line of Г' is associated with one point R on it.
Г has complete screw symmetry' about s. It is different from Г given by 
(4.6); their intersection is the congruence of lines Оз = 0, Q\ = 0 intersecting 
the screw axis orthogonally.
9. The midpoint line
If li and l2 are homologous lines, any point A} on h has its homologous 
point A2 on 12. The restriction that A । be on h only means that the coordinates 
of A । are linear functions of a parameter Л. The same is true for those of A2; 
hence the coordinates of the midpoint M of AXA2 are linear functions of Л. 
Therefore: the locus of the midpoints is a line m, the midpoint line of lt and 12. 
Since any point M is the midpoint of a unique point-pair AH A2> any line m is 
the midpoint line of a unique pair lb I2. This follows from (2.4) which can also 
be used to show that if O., O', are the coordinates of m, those of li(P, P') are
Pi = О» + O2 tan J</>,
P;= Qi+ O5tanJ<£ - Jd(~ OjtanJtf» + OzX

p;=o;[i4-tan2(^)].
Those of l2 are obtained by replacing ф and d in (9.1) by - ф and - d.
Giving m a certain orientation implies an orientation on !t and 12. If M is the 
point (XM, Ym, Zm) on m, and (cosa, cos/3,cos у) the direction of m, the 
points A! on li are by virtue of (2.4)
XM 4- A cosa 4- (Ум 4- A cos/3)tan |ф.

Hence the direction of h is given by
(9.2) 
cos a + cos p tan J ф, - cos a tan J ф + cos 0, cos y,
and that of 12 by
(9.3) 
cos a - cos P tan J ф, cos a tan J ф + cos /3, cos y.
For the angle Ф. between the oriented lines m and 1, we obtain
(9.4) 
cos ф = (1 + tan2(^)sin2y)“,/2
for i = 1,2. Hence the oriented line m makes equal angles with the oriented 
lines li and 12.
The direction cosines of the oriented line joining A । and A2 are seen to be
- 2tan зФ(Ум + A cos Д)/а, 2tan }ф(Хм + A cos a )/a, d/a,
where a is the distance A}A2. For the angle 17 between A{A2 and m we 
obtain
(9.5) 
cos 17 = (1/a ){2 tan I ф( - YM cos a + XM cos p) + d cos у },
which implies that a cos q is independent of A and leads to the conclusion 
that the projections of all joins A,A2 onto the midpoint line m are of equal 
length for all points on 1( and 12.
We have in particular: if any join A|A2 intersects m orthogonally all joins 
AjA2 do so. This occurs when the right-hand side of (9.5) is zero. For the line 
m, through XM, YMyZM and with direction cos a, cos/3, cosy we have
Оз = - cos у, О i = XM cos p - YM cos a.
Hence cos 77 = 0 if
ДОэ-2(?Иап1ф =0,
but this is identical to (4.6). Therefore: all joins AtA2 intersect m orthogonally 
if m is a line of the linear complex Г. In this situation the endpoints of the 
common perpendicular of 1H12 are a pair of homologous points and all points 
At of It may be displaced to their position A2 on 12 by a half-turn (i.e., a 
rotation of я radians) about m.
This property is a special case of the more general statement: Any line h 
may be transformed into its homologous line 12 by a rotation about m' which is 
the line conjugate to the midpoint line m with respect to Г. The proof follows: If 
line m is arbitrary all normal planes of A ,A2 are null-planes of points M on m 
with respect to the null correlation associated with Г. Therefore (as shown in 
Copyrighted material

TWO POSITIONS THEORY
[CH. 3,§9
Section 4) all normal planes pass through one line m', conjugate to m with 
respect to Г. Let A,, Bl be two points on h and A2y B2 the points homologous 
to them. Since line m' lies in the plane normal to the join AXA2, it is always 
possible to determine a plane a' perpendicular to m' which contains At and 
A2. Similarly B, and B2 are in a plane p' parallel to a' (Fig. 2). As 
AiB| = A2B2 their projections A,B; and A2B2 on a' are equal. Therefore we 
have in a' the points А ,, A 2, В J, В J such that AiB{ = A2B2. Planar kinematics 
implies that there is a rotation in a' such that Ab B[ are transformed into 
A2, B2. As the normal lines in a\ of joins AtA2 and B[B2, pass through the 
intersection T*  of m' and a', this point must be the rotation center. Therefore 
there is a rotation in space about m' such that Ab Bj are transformed into A2 
and B2, which implies that all points of l( are brought into their homologous 
positions. If m belongs to Г the conjugate line m' coincides with it and we 
have the special case of the rotation being a half-turn, as mentioned in the 
foregoing.
What are the loci of lt and 12 if m belongs to Г? If the coordinates of m are 
Oa,O! two points of m are (0,05, - 05» Oi) and (-05,0,0!, O2). The 
corresponding points of It are according to (2.4) (O5tan}4>, 
05,-O5~5dO!,Oi) and (-05,05tanj</>,O;-|dO2, O2). Hence for the 
Pliicker coordinates (q„ql) of 1> we have qj = ОзСО52(}</>): 05; m belongs 
to Г if ЛОэ-2О51ап|ф = 0 and therefore 1( satisfies dq3-qJsin</> =0, but 
that is the equation of Г'. Thus we have proved that when the midpoint line of

I, and 12 belongs to Г (which implies that h and 12 are interchanged by a 
half-turn about m) the lines h and l2 belong to linear complexes TJ and П in E} 
and E2 respectively, both coinciding with the complex Г' in S.
10. The line-bisectors
The spatial distance of two lines h, l2 is defined as the pair of numbers D, 8, 
where D stands for the length of their common perpendicular (D ^0) and 8 
is their angle (О^б^тг); the latter is an ambiguous concept, 6 can be 
replaced by n - 8.
Let О be the midpoint of the common perpendicular of L and l2, 1] and 12 
are the lines through О parallel to I, and 12, b and b' are the bisectors of 1{, IJ 
(Fig. 3, where О is taken as the origin of a Cartesian frame, with Oz along the 
common perpendicular and Ox, Ov along b and b'). We define b and b' to be 
the bisectors of lb 12.
If tan(23) = и the lines lt and 12 are represented by у + их = z + 2D = 0 
and у -их = z- \D=0. This implies that )( and 12 are interchanged by the 
transformation X = x, Y = - y, Z = - z, that is the half-turn about Ox. But 
each line n which intersects Ox orthogonally is invariant for this transforma­
tion. The conclusion is that any line n has equal spatial distances to b and 12; in 
the same way we prove that each line n' intersecting Ov orthogonally has this 
property. Hence any line which intersects orthogonally one of the bisectors b or 
b', of li and 12, has equal spatial distances to I, and 12. There are therefore two 
linear congruences of such lines.
Example 3. Show that the sets n and n' and two other linear congruences arc together the locus of lines with 
equal distances to lt and l2, (for instance by making use of the formulas for the angle and the distance of two 
lines given by their Plucker vectors).
Example 4. Show that there arc sixteen lines each with equal spatial distances to three given lines I|t 12,13. 
Example 5. Consider the special case of the three lines being coplanar or concurrent.
The definition of D, 8 has the disadvantage of being ambiguous. (We have 
the same situation for two lines in plane geometry.) It may be removed if we 
deal with orientated or directed lines, sometimes called spears. If h and 12 are 
given a direction, the parallel lines I! and IJ are also directed (Fig. 4.), their 
angle 5 has a well defined sense and so has the spatial distance D, 8 of h and 
l2. The two bisectors b and b' are no longer equivalent: we can distinguish 
between the internal bisector, b say, and the external bisector b'. (b and b' are

considered as undirected lines.) The spatial distance for two directed lines 
changes in general if we change the direction of one of them, but it remains 
the same if the directions of both are replaced by the opposite directions.
Let li and 13 be two directed lines and b, taken as Ox in the figures, be their 
internal bisector; let furthermore n be a line intersecting Ox orthogonally and 
let a direction be taken on it. If lt is reflected into Ox it coincides with the 
directed line la, but the direction of n is reversed. If on the other hand n' is a

line orthogonally intersecting OY the analogous argument shows that n' has 
(with both of its directions) equal distances to h and 12. The conclusion is: the 
locus of lines with equal distances to two directed lines is the congruence of lines 
intersecting their external bisector orthogonally.
A consequence, (which will be elaborated upon in Chapter IV, Section 7) 
is: if three directed lines lb 12, b are given there is one line L with equal 
distances to all three; it is the common perpendicular of the external bisectors 
of the pairs (12,13), (13,1,) and (lb 12); 1< will be called the central line of llt 12,13.

and the line 1> into l2 but with the opposite orientation. Each line n which 
intersects Ox orthogonally is invariant but its direction is also reversed. Hence 
any line n orthogonally intersecting Ox (with arbitrary direction) has equal 
distances to the directed lines lt and 12.

11. The instantaneous case
Instantaneous kinematics up to the first order may be considered a limit 
case of two positions theory. We suppose that </> —* 0 and but that 
d/ф—^а, the pitch of the instantaneous screw. Two homologous points Aj 
and A2 coincide, but their join has as limit position the tangent to the orbit 
described by the moving point A. The locus of these lines is still a quadratic 
complex C, the equation of which is the limit case of (3.4) and therefore reads
(11.1) 
a((?}+Ql)+Q3(?; = 0.
Furthermore the linear complexes Г and Г' coincide in the instantaneous case, 
the limit of both (4.6) and (8.2) being
(11.2) 
aQ3-Q'3 = 0.
We mention only one application. If a line moves continuously it generates a 
ruled surface. A line which is intersected by the next consecutive generator is 
called a torsal line of the surface. Hence the theorem: those lines of a 
moving space which are at a certain moment torsal lines of their trajectory 
surface belong to the quadratic complex (11.1).
The formulas (11.1) and (11.2) could also have been derived by means of 
the first order results of Chapter II (6.3) and (6.6). The Pliicker coordinates of

12. Another method to derive the screw displacement equations
So far wc have used special coordinate systems in order to simplify our 
equations. Sometimes however it is desirable to express the screw transforma­
tion in terms of a general coordinate system. We have already given one form 
of the general rotation matrix in Chapter I, Example 4, and will develop it 
further in Chapter VI. Here we derive another useful (albeit, less elegant) 
form. Before deriving the general formulas we will develop a very useful 
equation known as Rodrigues' formula for a general screw displacement. We 
obtain the formula as follows: we take point Pt and consider its displacement 
to position P2 in X. We consider its displacement as one whereby P, first 
rotates about the screw axis s to position P2 and then translates parallel to s 
from Pr2 to position P2. It follows that P, and P2 lie in the same plane normal 
to the screw axis. We take as the point where s cuts this plane, Pm the point 
where the perpendicular bisector of chord PjP2 cuts the chord, and the 
vectors ri and r2 as respectively the position vectors of Pj and P'2 relative to 
Sp. Then from Fig. 6 it follows that

(12.1) 
tan (ф/2) = PmPJPmSp = I n - r, |/| r, + r,|, 
where ф is the rotation angle of the displacement about the screw axis. If we 
introduce the unit vector s along the screw axis (with its positive sense defined 
in accordance with the right-hand rule relative to the rotation angle ф), we 
may write the vector expression
(12.2) 
r2 - n = (tan (ф/2))s x (r2 + n)
which follows from (12.1) as far as magnitude is concerned, and in direction 
from the figure.
(12.2) is Rodrigues’ formula for a planar displacement (Chapter VIII) with 
the origin at the center of the displacement.
If we consider the origin of coordinates located elsewhere on the screw axis 
say at point So then the position vectors of Pi and P'2 are Ri and R2, as shown 
in Fig. 7, and we have fi = R} - (S0SF)s, r2 = R2- (S0SP)s which when 
substituted into (12.2) yields
(12.3) 
R2 - Я, = (tan (ф /2))s x (R2 + Я.)
which is Rodrigues’ formula for a spherical displacement (Chapter VII) about 
an axis passing through the origin of coordinates.

If the origin of coordinates, O, does not lie on the screw axis, we take Sn as 
the position vector from О to So, and Pt and P2 respectively as the position 
vectors of Pi and P2 from O. We have Ri = Pi ~ So, R2 = P2- So which when 
substituted into (12.3) yields
(12.4) 
Pr2 - Pi = (tan (ф/2))з x (P'2 + P, - 2Sn),
which is Rodrigues’ formula for general spherical displacement measured 
relative to any arbitrary origin O.
For a general spatial displacement we must add the screw translation, d, 
which carries P'2 to position P2. Thus we substitute P2= P2- ds into (12.4), 
the result is
(12.5) 
P2 ~ Pi = (tan (ф/2))з x (P2 4- P, - 2S0) + ds,
which is Rodrigues’ formula for a general screw displacement.
Formulas (12.2)—(12.5) were developed by Rodrigues [1840] and used by 
him to solve various problems dealing with the resultant of a series of 
displacements. Since they involve P2 and P, on both sides of the equal sign, 
they usually require further manipulation. An alternative development starts 
with the fact that
(12.6) 
r2 = Ti cos ф + s x r, sin Ф.
which follows from the planar figure (Fig. 6) if we drop the normal from P2 to 
and keep in mind 
Now substituting r2 = R2 - (R2 • s)s, П «
Ri - (R} • s)s and using the facts that s x Ti = s x R, and s • Ri = s • R2 
yields
(12.7) 
R2 = Ri cos</> + s x R{ sin ф + (R} • s)s(l — cosd>).
Substituting
соьф = (1 - tan2(ф/2))/(1 4- tan2(d>/2)),
sin ф = 2(tan (</>/2))/(l + tan2(d>/2))
and rearranging (12.7) we get
R2 = Ri + s x R, [2(tan (ф/2))/(1 + tan2(Ф/2))]
+ [2tan2(ф/2)/(1 4- tan2(ф/2))][(Л, • s)s - R«]
but since (Ri • s)s - R, = s x ($ x Ri) we have
R2 = R, + (2(tan (ф/2))/(1 4- tan2(ф/2))]s

x (R, + tan (4>/2)j xR,).

Equations (12.9) and (12.10) each give equivalent vector forms of the general 
displacement equation, one being in terms of the full angle and the other the 
half-angle. In both cases the point P, is brought to position P2 by a screw 
displacement </>, d about an axis with direction s passing through a point So. If 
the screw axis passes through the origin of coordinates in X, all the terms with 
So disappear from (12.9) and (12.10).
Example 13. Show that the dyadic form of (12.9) is
P3 = R.‘(Р,-Sn) +Sa+ds
where the rotation dyadic R is
R = Ucos^-fX(Jsin^ + u(l - со$ф);
U is the unit dyadic. (For definitions see, for example. Wills (1931).)
If we expand (12.9) in terms of the scalar components P2(X2, Y2, Z2),

Hence (12.11) is a description of the displacement in terms of the screw 
parameters: ф (the rotation angle), d (the translation distance), s (the unit 
direction along the screw), So (a vector from the origin of coordinates to any 
point on the screw axis). At first it might seem as though we have eight rather 
than six parameters. However s must satisfy s • s = 1 and so it represents only 
two parameters. Similarly since So is any point on the screw axis the vector So 
only requires two parameters, hence one might set say So = 0 or, what is 
more usual, take So as the foot of the normal from the origin, in which case 
So • s = 0. The signs of Ф, d are related to s by the right-hand-screw rule.

A METHOD TO DERIVE THE SCREW DISPLACEMENT EQUATIONS

Equation (12.5) can be used to determine the screw parameters: Assume 
we are given two positions of E in terms of the positions of three non­
collinear points say P, Q, R- We write (12.5) twice: once for point P and once 
for point Q. Subtracting the Q equation from the P equation yields
(12.14) 
(P2 - Q2) - (P, - (?,) = (tan (<>/2))s x [(P2 - Q2) + (P, - (?,)],
Forming the cross product with [(Jt2- Qt)~ (Pi - <?i)] yields
tan (<fr/2)s = {[(P2 - Q2)~ (P, - <?,)] x [(P2 - Q2) - (P, - (?,)]}/ 
(12I5) 
{[(Л2 - <?,)-(«, - <?,)] • [(J»2 - Q2) + (P, - <?,)]}.
In obtaining (12.15) we have made use of the fact that [(P2 - (?2)~ (Pi - C?i)] 
is perpendicular to s, which is obvious if one substitutes P for P in (12.14).
If we operate on (12.5) with s x and also set s • So = 0 we have for the 
normal, to the screw from the origin,
(12.16) 
SOn = J[P, + P2 + (s x (P2- P,)/tan (ф/2))- 5 • (P2 + P,)$].
Finally operating on (12.5) with s • yields
(12.17) 
d = s - (P2-P.).
From (12.15) we obtain ф and s, from (12.16) So, and from (12.17) d. Hence 
the screw is completely determined from three non-collinear points.
Example 20. 
Show that if the displacement is such that (at least) one point of E remains fixed in 
I (i.e., it is either spherical (Chapter VII) or planar (Chapter VIII) we may set Q, = Q2 = 0 in 
(12.15).

(12.16) yields

and (12.17) yields J = s • P, where P, Q. R are the velocities of points P, Q, and R.
Example 22. Discuss the special cases for which (12.15) and the limiting case given in the 
previous example become indeterminate. (See for example Stieltjes (1884|.)
The theorem: a general displacement in three - space can be represented by a 
unique screw displacement is usually referred to as Chasles’ theorem. (Al­
though, both Mozzi and Cauchy seem to have preceeded Chasles with this 
result.) We mention two important special cases: When d = 0 the displace­
ment is a pure rotation. This causes no special difficulty, all the screw 
parameters are still unique and remain defined by the equations of this

section. However, if ф = 0 the displacement is a pure translation and the 
screw axis is no longer a unique line: any line parallel to a displacement vector 
can be taken as the screw axis. The displacement of every point is exactly the 
same, and so the displacement vector of any one point uniquely defines the 
magnitude of the translation, d, and the direction of the screw, s. Even though 
the direction of the screw is uniquely defined, its location is completely 
arbitrary.
An alternative, which is analogous to a well-known result in planar 
kinematics, is to choose the line at infinity in the planes normal to the 
displacement vector. The axis then is unique, and the vector of translation ds 
is now regarded as the result of an infinitesimal pure rotation, i.e. ф->0, 
about an infinitely distant axis.
Example 23. Verify that the foregoing discussion also applies to the limiting case described in 
Example 19.

CHAPTER IV
THREE POSITIONS THEORY
1. The screw triangle
We consider three positions Eb E2y E3 of a moving space E with respect to 
a fixed space S.
The displacement Et-+E2 may be performed by the screw motion 
s12(^!2, d>2) about the line S|2, ф12 and di2 being the rotation angle and the 
translation distance respectively. The displacement E2~*  E3 takes place by 
means of the screw motion s23(<£23, d23). As a line is determined by four 
parameters and a screw displacement therefore by six, a three positions 
configuration needs twelve pieces of data. $|2(Ф 12
*  du) and s23(023, d23) describe 
the three positions completely, hence s3i(<£3I,d3i) must be determined by 
them. Assuming for the time being that the two screw displacements are 
general and that sI2 and s23 are skew, we proceed as follows.
According to Chapter III, Section 1 any screw motion s(<£>, d) may be 
expressed as the product of two line reflections; the two lines intersect s 
orthogonally, their distance being Id and their angle 1ф. One of the two lines 
may be chosen arbitrarily, the other is then uniquely determined. Decompos­
ing 512(ф|2, d|2) we take as the second reflection that with respect to the 
common perpendicular n2 of si2 and s23; let n, be the other line. (See Fig. 8.) 
Furthermore we decompose s23(<£23, d23) in a similar way, now choosing n2 as 
the first line; let n3 be the second one. The displacement Ej->E3 can take 
place by the series of four reflections into respectively nb n2, n2, n3, which 
reduces to the reflections in n( and n3 respectively. The result of the latter is a 
screw motion about the common perpendicular s13 of m and n3, фи and 
being twice the angle and the distance of these lines. For the sake of symmetry 
we will measure from n3 to n( thereby obtaining s3i(<^3l,d3l) instead of 
Su(<£13, d|3).
Our construction has not only given us a geometrical method to find the 
product of two screw displacements but shows moreover that the configura-

tion of three positions is completely given when the three axes s&, s3», sl2 are 
known; the numerical data <f>ih dit follow from the angle and distance of the 
two common perpendiculars n„ п, of the axis s0. The description of three 
positions by means of three lines is not only relatively simple, but moreover 
attractively symmetric because all three positions are dealt with equivalently. 
Note that the figure of three lines depends on 12 data as is expected.
If A । is a point of Ei successive reflection in n( and n2 gives us A2, by 
successive reflection of A, in П| and n3 we obtain A3. Hence if A * is the 
reflection of A! in nb it is also that of A2 in n2 and of A 3 in n3. Therefore a 
triplet of three homologous points A,, A2, A3 may always be found by 
reflecting an arbitrary point A * of S into nb n2, n3 respectively; A • is the 
basic point or the fundamental point of the triplet. In the same manner three 
homologous lines (or planes) may be obtained by reflecting an arbitrary basic 
line (or plane) into nlt n2, n3.
The configuration of the three screw axes s23, s3(, sI2 and their common 
perpendiculars nb n2, n3 is called the screw triangle9; s23, s3I, s12 are its 
"vertices" and nb n2, n3 their opposite "sides". Several cases of degeneration 
of the screw triangle appear if the screw displacements are not all general or if 
their axes are not all skew lines. So, for instance, if s» is the axis of a pure 
rotation n2 and n3 intersect; if the displacement is a translation, n2 and n3 are 
parallel. Two screw axes may have a point of intersection or may be parallel

common perpendicular. Some of the special cases will be dealt with later on.
General expressions relating the elements of the screw triangle can be 
obtained as follows:
The screw triangle, shown in Fig. 9, is defined so that the distance between 
screws sQ and s/k is a, and the angle between them is at. The distance between 
normals П| and nfc is dlk/2, and the angle between them is фл/2. The triangle is 
shown as a set of directed vectors so that the positive sense of is from n< 
toward nk and that of n, is from s0 toward s/k where /, к are in the cyclic order 
1, 2, or 2, 3, or 3, 1, and angles are measured in the sense given by the 
right-hand screw rule. (See Figs. 9, 10, 11.)
With these conventions, if we take the spherical triangle with edges parallel 
to S|2, a», S31 we obtain from the cosine law

cos(<£3i/2) = cos(<£i2/2)cos(<£w/2)~ costr2Sin(<£l2/2)sin((£u/2)

ments, it is possible to determine the third displacement by use of these

This completes our description of screw s3l which is entrirely determined by 
(1.8), (1.10), (1.11), and (1.12) if we know Si2(</>12, di2) and s23(<£23, d23).
Use the geometry of the screw triangle to show that:
Example I. The product of two general displacements is itself a general displacement.
Example 2. The product of two rotations is a general displacement unless the rotation axes 
intersect, in which case the product is a pure rotation and the point of intersection is a fixed point. 
Example 3. The product of two rotations about parallel axes is a pure rotation.
Example 4. The product of a translation and a general displacement has the same rotation as the 
given general displacement. (This follows if, for example, when d>2» * 0, sl3 and s() are parallel.) 
Example 5. The product of equal anjd opposite rotations about parallel axes is a translation 
normal to the direction of (he axes.
• We have used s3, heretofore in order to make the equations symmetrical. The screws s,, and 
iu both have the same axis, they differ only in sense: 
are measured from n> to n> while фЭ|,
d}i are measured from n> to n,.
Example 6. The effect of reversing the order of two general displacements is to reverse the 
sense of the resultant screw and to displace it by reflecting it (i.e. a half-tum) about n2. Hence, two 
displacements commute only when they are such that the resultant screw (i.e. s(>) intersects their 
common normal (n2). However, the magnitude of the product (i.e., |, |Фи1) is invariant to the 
order?
Example 7. Show that if - 0, a derivation similar to the general case yields:
tan(4>i,/2) = tan(d>ij/2) = (A^ —Au) ’ (j.»i x (s» x s,())/((A>i ~ Au) • (i2, x g„))
(</3i/2) = (■— ’ A»+ (s,( •

where кл is arbitrary.
In the foregoing wc have used a double subscript notation for the screws 
and their displacement parameters. A simpler notation follows if we denote s9 
by sk, ф„ by фку and d4 by dk. In which case we replace $23, j3i, st2 by sit s2, s3 
respectively. The common perpendiculars maintain the same subscripts as 
before. Hence, the perpendicular of s2, s3 is nu that of s3, Si is n2, and the one 
between sb s2 is n3. The following section is written in terms of this single 
subscript notation.
2. The plane at infinity
The plane V at infinity is as a whole invariant for any displacement. 
Therefore, if A is a point of E in V, the three homologous points Ab A2, A3

the polar lines of P2 and P3. Hence P\P2Py and N»N2N3 are reciprocally polar 
triangles with respect to 0; 
N2, N3 are the poles of Р2РзУ Р3РН P^Pi', one
triangle determines the other one.
It is well-known from plane projective geometry that P2N2 and P^Ni 
pass through one point H. or in other words that the two triangles are in 
Desarguesian position (Fig. 12). This may be proved also by making use of 
space geometry in the following way. Take an arbitrary point O, and let s', nl 
pass through O, parallel to s„ n, (i = 1,2,3). The statement comes to this: in 
the trihedron Osls^sJ the plane through si perpendicular to the plane sjsi, and 
the two similar planes pass through one line, a known theorem of solid 
geometry. A proof may be given by vector algebra. If s, is a vector along s',

vectors along nJ, nJ, nJ are given by s2x$t, $эх jb $, x $2 and the theorem 
follows from the fact that x (s2 x f<), s2 x ($, x s,), s, x (s, x s2) are linearly 
dependent.
In order to describe a triad of homologous points At, A2, Ay in V we 
remark that each point of V corresponds to a direction in space, parallel lines 
having the same direction. If in space we consider a basic line a*  its three 
related homologous lines aH a2, a^ are found as the reflections of a*  into nb n2, 
n» respectively. In as far as directions concern us, all lines may be replaced by 
parallel lines all passing through O, denoted by primes. Thus the direction of 
ai is found by reflecting a*'
 into nJ and so on. But a* ’ and nJ are in one plane 
and therefore a! is also in this plane. This means that A, is on the line N|A \ 
A * being the point of a*  at infinity. The reflection into n! is a displacement 
and therefore a linear transformation in space; hence it induces a linear 
transformation in V. As Ni and all points of its polar line are fixed points and 
as moreover the transformation is involutory. A, is seen to be that point on 
NiA * which is harmonic with A * with respect to the point N, and the 
intersection of N|A
*
 and the polar line. This projective transformation in V 
will be called reflection into the point ЛЛ or, with the same justification, 
reflection into the polar line P2Py of Nt. Hence: any three homologous points in 
V are found as reflections of an arbitrary basic point A * into the three points N, 
(or into the sides of the triangle PtP2Py).
We have dwelt on what takes place in V for several reasons. The metric in 
V is not Euclidean; the absolute being a non-degenerate and imaginary conic 
ft, we have dealt with kinematics in plane elliptic geometry. A systematic 
treatment of kinematics in spaces other than Euclidean ones is given in 
Chapter XII. Here however, since kinematics in V appears naturally it serves 
as a good introductory example. A second reason for looking at V is that 
Euclidean kinematics can not be understood without asking what is going on 
at infinity. A third justification is the fact that kinematics in V is strongly 
related to (if not identical with) spherical kinematics, to be treated in Chapter 
VII, and that plane Euclidean kinematics (Chapter VIII) may be considered 
as a limiting case of the latter.
3. The planes through three homologous points

(А)А2Аз) of homologous points, each of which is related to its own basic 
point A *.  The points A, will in general be linearly independent; hence they

THE PLANES THROUGH THREE HOMOLOGOUS POINTS

determine a plane a. We now consider the relationship between A * and a. If 
A * is in V this is trivial: all points of V correspond to the plane V itself.
Let A * be a finite point and its rectangular coordinates be (xi, x2, Xy). Then 
those of A„ as we know, are linear functions of x,. Hence, introducing 
homogeneous coordinates, we may construct a matrix of three rows and four 
columns the elements of which are the coordinates of a triad of homologous 
points:
(3.1) 
||Lh Li2 G, x4||, (< = 1,2,3)
in which L*  is a homogeneous linear function of хь x2, хъ x4. The coordinates 
Ut of the plane a are proportional to the four determinants of (3.1). We 
obtain
(3.2) 
U< = Ftx., U2 = F2x4, Uy = F,x4, U. = G,
in which F (i = 1,2,3) are quadratic polynomials and G is a cubic polynomial 
in x(. If x4 = 0 (3.2) gives us the plane V, so that (3.2) expresses the relationship 
between A * and a for all cases.
Let, on the other hand, a be an arbitrary plane; if it will contain a point A, 
then A * must be in the plane ot(, the reflection of a into n,. The three planes a. 
(which are a triad of homologous planes) have in general one point of 
intersection A • and its three reflections arc all in a. Hence: a plane a 
contains in general one triad of homologous points.
If U are the coordinates of a plane and U\those of its reflection into a line, 
then Gi, G*
2, Uy are linear functions of Gb U2, Uy, while GJ is a linear 
function of Gj, G2, Uy, U<. The coordinates of a triad a, can therefore be 
arranged in a 3x4 matrix:
(3.3) 
||Ln Li2 L.y 
i = 1,2,3,
in which the linear functions L4 (i,j = 1,2,3) depend on Gb G2, G^only. We 
obtain for the coordinates of A •:
(3.4) 
Xi«G, + D,G4, x2=G2+D2G4, x5«Gs+DjG4, x4=G4,
in which G, are cubic polynomials and D, quadratic polynomials of 
G|, G2, Gj.
(3.2) and its inverse (3.4) show that there exists a birational cubic relationship 
between a basic point A • and the plane a through the triad of homologous 
points associated with it; it is the same as that between a basic plane a  and the 
point of intersection of the triad of homologous planes associated with it.

4. Collinear homologous points
The cubic relationship obviously has singularities. Indeed if A * is such that 
Аь A2, Ay are one line 1 the plane a is not unique: A * is associated with all 
planes of the pencil through 1. Inversely, if a is such that ab a2, a3 pass 
through one line Г it is associated with all points on Г.
If Ab A2, Ay are collinear the rank of the matrix (3.1) must be less than 
three (and inversely a rank of less than three implies collinearity). Suppose 
first that A * is a finite point: which implies x4 / 0. No two rows of (3.1) can be 
linearly dependent because a general displacement has no finite fixed point. 
In view of the fourth column the three rows are linearly dependent if the last 
row is equal to the sum of the first and the second, multiplied by Л and 1 - Л 
respectively, in which Л is an arbitrary number unequal to ®, 0 or 1. This gives 
rise to three homogeneous linear equations for x,:
Ly\ = AL|| + (1 — Л )Z^2b Cm = AL|2 + (1 — A )I-22»
(4Л) 
L,,= AL„ + (1-A)Ln,
the solutions of which are
(4.2) 
X,: x2: x3: x4 = G(A): C2(A): C3(A): C4(A),
C, being a polynomial of the third degree in A. Hence the locus of the finite 
points A*  for which Ab A2, Ay are collinear is a twisted cubic, which we 
denote by c. All parameter values A, unequal to », 0, 1 correspond to finite 
points on c. Hence A = oo, A = 0, A = 1 correspond to the three intersections 
of c and V. From (4.1) it follows that for A = » A, and A2 coincide, for A = 0 
A2 and Ay coincide, for A = 1 Ay and A} conicide. Therefore the points 
A = 00, A = 0, A = 1 of c are the points Py, Pu P2 respectively, these points 
being the only real ones for which two points A. coincide. The conclusion is: 
the twisted cubic c passes through the points at infinity of the screw axes s(. It is 
therefore a cubic hyperbola.
Suppose now that A * is a point of V, x4 = 0. According to (3.1) the three 
points A, are collinear if
(4.3) 
Lt2 L,3| = 0;
in this determinant x4 = 0 is substituted in L1; which is now a linear function in 
just xb x2, x3. Obviously (4.3) represents a cubic c' in V.
If two of the three homologous points, A2 and A3 say, coincide then A A2, 
Ay are collinear and thus A*  is on c'. There are six cases for which this 
situation takes place. If A * coincides with P, its reflections A2 into P\Py and

COLLINEAR HOMOLOGOUS POINTS

Ay into P>P2 both coincide with P}\ therefore Pi is a point of c' and so are P2 
and Py. Furthermore let h and /{ be the intersections of N2Ny and D (which 
means that they are the isotropic points of any plane perpendicular to st). 
These two points are interchanged by reflection into N2 as well as into Ny. 
Thus if A * is at then A2 and Ay coincide at /I, which means that h is on c'. 
The plane cubic c' passes through the points at infinity of the screw axes and 
through the isotropic points of the planes perpendicular to these axes. In general 
c' is determined by these nine points.
It may be shown, as follows, that c' passes through three more points of the 
configuration. If m is a line in V on which three homologous points A t, A2, Ay 
lie then obviously the three reflections mb m2, m3 of m pass through a point 
A * on c'. Now take N2N3 as line m; its reflection m2 into N2 is m itself, its 
reflection m3 into Ny is again m itself, its reflection m, into N} passes through 
the intersection Tt of m and P2Py because all points of P2Py are fixed points of 
this reflection. Hence Ti is a point of c' and so is the intersection T2 of NyNt 
and P3Pi, and similarly the intersection Ту of NtN2 and Р,Р2.
Ti, T2t Ту are the third intersections of c' and P2P3, P3Pi, and P>P2 
respectively. Moreover, according to Desargues’ theorem they are on one 
line h. (Fig. 13.)
The curve c*  plays a part in plane elliptic kinematics. Its meaning for 
common spatial kinematics is obviously as follows: if three homologous lines L 
are parallel to one plane the basic line of the triad is parallel to a generator of 
a cubic cone having c' as its intersection with the plane V at infinity.
Summing up we have: the complete locus of the basic point A * such that A b 
A2, Ay are collinear consists of the twisted cubic c and the plane cubic c’. The 
locus of At is a twisted cubic ct and the plane cubic ci.
The triad of homologous points associated with a point A * is on one line if 
A • is on c or on c'. For such a point A * the plane a is not uniquely 
determined; corresponding to it is not one plane but a pencil of planes. This 
means that the points on c and c' are the singular points of the cubic 
relationship (3.2). Hence for such points the expressions Ut given by (3.2) are 
all zero. Therefore the varieties СД = 0, C/2 = 0, l/3 = 0, U4 = 0 contain the 
curves c and c'. In view of the expressions for Uly U2, Uy it follows that the 
quadrics F, = 0, F2 = 0, F3 = 0 pass through c, and the cubic surface G = 0 
passes through c and c'. We mention some consequences. The planes through 
a point В(Ьь b2, by, b4) satisfy the equation b}Ut + b2U2 + byUy+ b4U4 = 0; the 
locus of the points associated with these planes is a cubic surface through c and 
c*.  If b4 = 0, that is if the planes are all parallel to a certain line the cubic 
surface degenerates into V and a quadric. Furthermore we may understand

now more clearly why the inverse of (3.2) is a unique point. Let 
Ur. U2: U>:

satisfies k2U} - k}U2 = 0, k3Ui - ktU> = 0, k4Ut - ktU4 = 0 (or three similar 
equations if ki = 0). The finite points satisfying the first two are on the 
intersection of two quadrics through c; it consists therefore of c and one of its 
chords. The third equation represents a cubic surface through c; its third 
intersection with the chord is the unique non-singular point corresponding to 
the given plane. Singular planes of the cubic relationship will be dealt with 
later (Section 6).
5. Lines through three homologous points
There are points A • for which Ab A2, A, are on one line; hence there 
are »’ such lines. Their locus will now be considered. It consists of two sets,

lines associated with points of c and those associated with c'. The first are lines 
in space generating a ruled surface F, the others are in V enveloping a curve 
of a certain class.
Let A * be a point of c; its reflections A, into n< are on a line I. Hence the 
midpoints B, of A 'A, are on a line Г parallel to I, B, is the projection of A * 
on n*.  Each line Г intersects n(, n2, n3, it is a transversal of these three lines and 
therefore belongs to the regulus of such transversals which is the hyperboloid 
Q through n<; the lines n( belong to the other regulus. The first conclusion 
reads: each line 1 is parallel to a line of the regulus of Г, or in other words all 
lines I have their points at infinity on the conic k, the intersection of Q and V. 
Each line Г gives rise to a line I; indeed the three planes through P, 
perpendicular to n< have a point of intersection A * from which I follows. 
Hence there is one line 1 through any point of к and a 1,1 relationship, 
without singularities, between the points of к and the points A * on c. From 
this it follows that the points of к and c are projectively related. On к lie the 
three special points N; the line Г through Nt is parallel to nf, B} is at infinity, 
hence A * is at infinity and coincides with P,. Therefore in the projectivity 
between к and c the points Nt on к correspond to the points P. on c 
(i = 1,2,3); the projectivity is determined by the three pairs.
The points A, are the reflections of A * into n,; their locus is the twisted 
cubic Ci, the reflection of c into nb This implies a projectivity between the 
points A । of Ci and those of k. The curve Ci passes through P2, P3 and the point 
PI which is the reflection of Pj into Nx. In the projectivity between к and ct 
Ni, Na, N3 correspond to Pl, P2, P3. We have arrived at the following 
conclusion: the lines I join corresponding points of two projective curves, the 
twisted cubic Ci and the conic k.
The coordinates of the points of c1 are cubic polynomials of a parameter Л; 
we introduce a parameter on к such that corresponding points are denoted by 
the same value of A ; the coordinates of the point of к are quadratic functions 
of A. Therefore the Pliicker coordinates of the lines 1 are of the fifth degree in 
A. The locus F of the lines 1 in space, on which three homologous points lie, is a 
rational ruled surface of the fifth order.
Three generators of F are in V, the line NjPJ (which is the same line as 
N1P1) and the lines N2P2, N>P3. These three lines pass through the point H. 
Thus the intersection of F and V is a degenerate curve of the fifth order ; it 
consists of the conic к and the three lines NtPt through H.
Ci is a twisted cubic on F and so are c2 and c3, the reflections of c into n2 and 
n5; Ci passes through PJ, P2, P3, c2 through P|P5P3, c3 through Р,Р2Ръ two 
curves ct have one common point at infinity.

Ruled surfaces of the fifth order have been investigated and protectively 
classified by Cayley, by Schwarz and more recently by Edge. Our F is a 
(metrically specialized) surface of type II in Schwarz’s classification. We 
return to some of its properties later on (Section 10).
Considering now triads of collinear homologous points AH A?, Aj in V, we 
know that their basic point A * is on the plane cubic c'. In order to determine 
the set of lines m on which these triads lie we remark that they must be such 
that their reflections m, in N, pass through one point, the basic point. But in 
view of the complete duality in V between points and lines the determination 
of homologous lines passing through one point is essentially the same as the 
determination of homologous points on one line. Hence the set of lines on 
which three homologous points of V lie is the curve C' of the third class, polar 
with c' with respect to Q. The lines N2N3, NjN>, NtN2 belong to the set; so do 
the lines N}P}, N2P2, NyPy, passing through H (which is dual to the line h 
through Tt, T2, T>) and the three pairs of tangents of D through Pb P2, P> 
(dual to the six isotropic points of c'). The complete locus of lines through three 
homologous points consists of F and C'; it is of the eighth order.
6. The intersection of three homologous planes
We know from Sections 3 and 4 that there exists a birational cubic 
relationship between a basic point A * and the plane a through the three 
reflections A t, A2, A s of A * into n4. If A * is on c the points At are on one line 
I; A * corresponds then to the planes of the pencil through 1, it is a singular 
point of the relationship. In general one triad of homologous planes passes 
through an arbitrary point A *,  namely that consisting of the three reflections 
<xb «2. a> of the plane a corresponding to A *.  If A * is on c there are triads 
of homologous planes through it.
We consider now the dual problem. In general three homologous planes ои, 
ot2, a3 have one point of intersection; it is the point A * corresponding to the 
basic plane a of a,. We consider now those triads of homologous planes which 
have a common line of intersection; their basic plane a, is a singular plane of 
the cubic relationship for it does not correspond to one point but to a line of 
points A *.  For such a singular plane a(Ub C/2, 
U4) the expressions xf of
(3.4) are all zero, or in other words the matrix (3.3) has rank two. It is a 3 x 4 
matrix the elements of which are homogeneous linear functions of Ц. Our 
problem is a special case of a more general one. Let a p x q matrix be given, 
the elements of which are linear functions of n variables x6 One may ask for

which points (with coordinates xt) the matrix has a given rank; this variety is 
called a determinantal locus. The subject was extensively treated by Room 
[1938], who has derived general formulas for the order of such a variety. We 
give a direct proof for our case. If the matrix (3.3) has rank two its four 3x3 
determinants must be zero. If D\ and D2 are the determinants obtained by 
omitting the first and the second column respectively, Di = 0 and D^ = 0 
define cubic varieties and their intersection has order 9. But to arrive at the 
determinanial locus we must leave out all those points for which the 3x2 
matrix of the first and second column has rank one. Following the same 
procedure we find that they are on a variety of order 4-1 = 3. Hence our 
locus has order six.
The variety of singular planes is a developable (or torse) T of class six. A 
developable is a set of »' planes. Its class being six means that six planes pass 
through an arbitrary point.
Singular points are those for which the matrix (3.1) has rank two. Due to its 
special properties we have treated it somewhat differently, but we remark that 
in this case the variety also has order six, even though it degenerates into two 
cubic varieties, the curves c and c'.
In the case of T no degeneration takes place (as we shall see) but it has a 
special relation to the plane V at infinity. First of all V belongs to it; indeed 
for Ui = U2 = the first three columns of (3.3) are all zero. But furthermore, 
of the six planes of T through an arbitrary point of V three always coincide 
with V. Hence: V is a triple plane of T.
A general plane contains one triad of homologous points; in a singular 
plane there are »’ (in V there are »2). Let A,, A2. Ay and B2, By be two 
triads in a plane a. Hence any point M, on A|B, has its homologous M2 on 
A2B2 and My on AyBy. Hence the triads M2, My of homologous points in 
the singular plane a are all inscribed in three (homologous) lines 1,. The lines 
MiM2 join congruent point rows on lt and 12, they are the tangents of a 
parabola; the lines MtMy are the tangents of a second parabola. The two 
parabolas have (besides h and the line at infinity) two common tangents. 
Therefore: among the triads in a, there are two collinear ones. On the other 
hand: if a plane contains two collinear triads, it is singular. Collinear triads lie 
on a generator of F. Hence: the developable T of singular planes consists of the 
planes through two intersecting generators of the fifth order ruled surface F.
We have generated F by joining corresponding points on the projectively 
related curves c> and k. Let ch(A) be the coordinates of a point of Ci, and 
kt (A) (i = 1,2,3,4) the corresponding homogeneous coordinates of a point of 
k. The generator A, and the generator A intersect if

By subtracting the third row from the first, and the fourth from the second it is 
seen that among the five roots of (6.1) Л = A, appears twice. Hence: a 
generator of F is intersected by three other generators. Therefore three planes of 
T pass through any generator of F. If Fis a generator and L its point at infinity, 
three finite planes of T pass through L and we see again that the other three 
coincide with V.
If I is a generator and Г an intersecting one the locus of the point of 
intersection of 1 and Г is the double curve d of F. The developable T of singular 
planes consists of the planes tangent to F at the points of its double curve.
On each generator 1 there are three points of d; if I and Г intersect at M the 
plane through I and Г being tangent to F is tangent to d at M; this plane has 
four more intersections with d, two on I and two on Г. Hence the order of the 
double curve d is six.
We remark finally that the points at infinity of the three homologous lines 
of a singular plane are obviously homologous points and they lie on one line. 
The conclusion is: the planes of T intersect V in the lines of C', the set is of the 
third class.
7. Three homologous lines
If a basic line I*  is reflected into n, we obtain a triad of homologous lines l>, 
l2, Ij. We consider the special triads with the property that all three lines 
mutually intersect. In Chapter III we have shown that 1( and l2 intersect if they 
both belong to a (special) tetrahedral complex. Therefore we could answer 
our question by considering the intersections of three such complexes. There 
is a more simple method however if we keep in mind that if three lines 
mutually intersect they are in one plane or pass through one point.
Let h, I2, b be in one plane a. Then for any point Mi on h the homologous 
points M2 and My are on 12 and l3 respectively. Hence a contains an infinity of 
triads of homologous points and it is therefore singular; on the other hand a 
singular plane contains one triad of homologous lines. The planes of three

THREE HOMOLOGOUS LINES
79
coplanar homologous lines are the singular planes. There are »' singular 
planes; hence the locus of the lines I, of a coplanar triad is a ruled surface R, 
and that of its basic lines Г is a ruled surface R*.
Any singular plane a contains two intersecting generators a and b of the 
ruled surface F. On a there are three homologous points AH A2, Ay and on b 
three homologous points Вь B2, By. The homologous lines in a are therefore 
AtBi, A2B2 and AxBy. But A, and Bi for instance are both on the twisted 
cubic Ci; thus h is a chord of c, and similar for 12 and !э; Г is a chord of c.
If L, is the point at infinity of I, the three points Lt, L2, Ly are a homologous 
triad of points and moreover are collinear. Hence the locus of L, is the plane 
cubic ci and the result is: the ruled surface R, consists of those lines which are 
chords of c, and intersect cL The generators of R*  are the lines Г intersecting 
c' and intersecting c twice.
Any generator a of F is met by three other generators b, b' and b". 
Therefore through the point A । on a pass three generators of R,, joining A । to 
B,, BL B7. Hence Ci is a threefold curve on R:.
Through a point outside a twisted cubic there passes always one of its 
chords. The conclusion is: through any point of the curve c! passes one 
generator of Rt, and therefore ci is a directrix of Rb
To determine the order of Rt we may proceed as follows. There is an 
involutory 3,3 correspondence on ct, the join of two corresponding points 
being a generator of R|. The order of R, is the number of generators 
intersecting an arbitrary line m in space. Through a point A, on Ci pass two 
chords intersecting m; in fact, they join A, to the two remaining intersections 
AA” of Ci and the plane through A, and m. Therefore m induces on c, an 
involutory 2,2 correspondence. A p,p correspondence and a q, q have pq 
pairs in common. Consequently six generators of R, intersect m. The order of 
R, is six and the same holds for R, and R*.
The twisted cubic Ci passes through the points PL P2 and Py at infinity and 
so does the plane cubic cL In the 3,3 correspondence P\ and P2, P\ and P,, P2 
and Py are corresponding points. Hence the lines PJP2, PJPi, P2Py are 
generators of R,, they are after all the only chords of Ci in V and they intersect 
cL The intersection of Rj and V consists of cj and these three chords, and it is 
accordingly of order six.
The problem to determine triads of homologous lines lt, h, 1> passing through 
one point A is easily dealt with in view of our former results. Indeed it means 
that in the inverse displacement three homologous points are on one line. 
According to Sections 4 and 5, the locus of A is a twisted cubic and the loci of 
I, are ruled surfaces of the fifth order.

In the same way, using the inverse displacements, the results of this section 
could give the same information about three homologous planes passing 
through one line as was obtained in Section 6.
In general the triad of homologous lines lb l2, Ь is skew, i.e., none of the 
lines intersect. The simplest surface which contains them is either a hyper­
boloid of one sheet or a hyperbolic paraboloid. Such surfaces are of little 
interest to us since they do not lead to important properties associated with 
three positions of a line. Instead we consider a special line congruence defined 
by the homologous triad 1(, 12, h; this will lead us to an important correspon­
dence between lines in the moving and fixed space.
We ask ourselves: if we consider only the positions of the lines 1. (and not 
their points), does there exist a single line in 2 which could be the screw axis 
for displacements 1,—»l2, 12—and h—► !>? We will show that the answer is 
affirmative, and that each homologous set lb 12,1, defines a unique line le, in 2, 
which we call its axis. Since we do not restrict the pitch of the screw along lc, 
the displacement 1, —► 1; will follow by rotating and translating 1, about lc using 
different pitches (i.e., ratios of translations to rotations) for each displace­
ment. Since L acts as a screw axis the directed distance and angle between lc

being coupled to lc by a rigid bar with joints at each end which allow turning

way has two freedoms: it may be rotated about and translated along lc. Hence, 
the locus of the three lines 1, is such that they belong to a line congruence. Just 
as a circle in a plane is the locus of all points at a fixed distance from a point in 
that plane, this congruence in 3-space is the locus of all lines at a fixed angle 
and distance from a line in that space. The line lc is referred to as the central 
axis of the congruence. The three directed lines 1, completely and uniquely 
define the congruence and the central axis lc. Conversely, if we invert, holding 
E, fixed, I, is the central axis for the congruence defined by the positions of lc. 
It then follows that I. (as well as the basic line Г corresponding to I,) is in 1,1 
reciprocal correspondence with axis l<.
In order to formulate the foregoing analytically we define the Pliicker 
vectors (I, /*)  for the directed line 1, so that I, is parallel to I, and, furthermore, 
if A, and B, are two distinct points on L, the vector I, is directed from A, 
toward B, (for all values of i). The moment vector Г, is defined by Г, = a, x /, 
where a. is the position vector of a point At on 1,. Similarly we have the 
Pliicker vectors (/c, Tc) for a directed line lc in 1. Letting 0. and D, denote 
respectively the scalar angle and distance between 1, and lc, it follows that
(7.1) 
/l-/c = H||/Jcos0.
(7.2) 
Г.-^ + Г'!, = |l НМД sin0,.
We point out in passing that, because of the definition of moment vector, 
the sign convention is such that when D, sin0, is negative (positive) the right 
hand rule applied to the cross product of line vectors along I, and lc — in any 
order — is such that the thumb points from the first toward (away from) the 
second line of the cross product.
From (7.1) the condition cos0, = cos02 = cos0A, assuming Ц I = constant 
(usually I*  = 1), yields
(7.3) 
«-li)4»0 / = 2,3.
The two equations (7.3) represent necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for 
01 = 02 = 03.
Since for a general displacement 1 —> /, I, - Ц can be written as a homogene­
ous linear function of the coordinates of I*  (the basic line Iе is given by 
Pliicker vectors /*,  /'*),
 it follows that if we know sJ2, Sji (7.3) represents the 
1,1 reciprocal correspondence between the directions of 1*  and lc. That is to 
say we may choose /*  and uniquely determine the directions of lc, or choose le 
and uniquely determine the directions of 1*.  It also follows from (7.3) that the 
singular directions of this correspondence are the screws: If lc is taken parallel

to either sJ2, Sn, or s3l there is a single infinity of corresponding directions /*  
all of which are parallel to one plane, while if f * is taken parallel to either s* 2, 
s2b or s*i  the corresponding l( are all parallel to a plane. We point out that 
this 1,1 correspondence depends only upon the directions of the screws and 
the rotations about them, it in no way contains their positions or translation. 
Hence, we may say it depends only upon the spherical properties of the 
displacement.
From (7.2) the condition Disin0, = D2Sin02 = DiSinOj, assuming Щ = 
constant, yields
(7.4) 
(/J-/',)• t + f >((-/,) = 0 j = 2,3.
If (7.3) is satisfied then (7.4) is sufficient to guarantee that Dt = D2 = Dx and 
01 = 02 = 0». Recalling that Г, (i = 1,2,3) is a linear non-homogeneous 
function of /'*  (it is also a function of /*),  it is obvious that if /*  and fc are 
known, (7.4) may be regarded as two non-homogeneous linear equations in 
/’* and /J.
For any pair of directions /*,/<  which satisfy the directional correspon­
dence, equations (7.4) together with the fundamental relationships

are sufficient to determine the Г\ГС correspondence. Clearly this is also a 
reciprocal 1,1 correspondence: if we choose /'*  we can use (7.4) and (7.5) to 
uniquely determine /', or choosing l'< we can determine /'*.
We have thus proved the existence, in general, of a 1,1 reciprocal 
correspondence of basic lines Г and fixed lines lo such that the fixed lc is a 
screw axis for the displacement of lines 1. (i = 1,2,3). The foregoing proof 
also provides the outline of a computational procedure for determining 
corresponding pairs Г,1с.
We determine the order of the correspondence between the basic line and 
the central axis by means of an example. We take three mutually orthogonal 
screws with axes
Sn: Y = b, Z = - c; 
sM: X = - a, Z = c; 
su: X = a, Y = - b.
It follows then that the normals between the screws are
n j: Y = - b, Z = c; 
n2: X = a, Z = - c; 
n3: X = - a, Y = b.
If a basic line, Г, is denoted by its Pliicker coordinates p0, then the 
corresponding 1, must have the components:

coordinates of U by we have from (7.3)
— Pl4C |4 + P24C24 = 0

while (7.5) gives
C31C24 + C12C34 + C23C14= 0.
We have now three non-homogeneous linear equations for С2э»сзьс|2, which 
may be solved in terms of cl4, c24, cM, a, b, c. The common denominator is seen 
to be SJ? = p24pt + PmPh + PmP24. Multiplying all six numbers cu by we

Hence the relationship between I*  and U is seen to be a sextic correspon­
dence for this case. Following a similar procedure it is possible to show that 
this relationship is in fact also sextic for any general set of three displace­
ments.

the form
Cm = Oi/V. Cj4 = Qjff, Cm s Qtff, Си = S|, С» ж Sj, Сц • Sj.
A natural next step is to inquire if any special relationship exists between 
the screw axis for the displacement of E and the central axis lc of the 
congruence determined by h, 12> 13. The results follow directly from the screw 
triangle geometry: since displacement L—►!, may be obtained by a screw 
displacement about Ц, all possible configurations of Et must follow from 
screwing E. first about le and then about a screw axis coincident with 1,. Hence 
we may regard lc as S|2, 1, as s23, and s0 as sJ3 in the screw triangle (Section 1). 
The result, as shown in Fig. 15, is the theorem: the normal nb between 1, and 
sv> and the normal ne, between Ц and sQ, are related so that the distance between 
them equals djl and the angle between them is фцГ1, both measured about s0 
in the sense of n< to nc with n, and nc extended if necessary so that фм/2 < тг.
Applying this theorem to two screws say sl2, s13 yields another method to 
determine the L, U correspondence: If we choose a line h, the normal nc is 
determined by screwing the normal between lt and st2 about s)2 by 
(ф12/2,Л12/2). The normal n*  see Fig. 16, is obtained by screwing the normal 
between lt and s(3 about s13 by (ф|3/2, dJ3/2). The axis L corresponding to li is 
the common normal to nc, nJ.

THREE HOMOLOGOUS LINES
85
Similarly if we start with ic and determine nc and nJ, screwing nc and n'c 
backwards along sl2 and sn yields the lines for which lt is the common normal.
Returning to Fig. 15, for the screw triangle composed of “screws” sv, L and 
L it follows that the angle between n! and nc must be a,J2 and the distance 
between them c4/2, measured from nJ to nc, where ait and ct, are the screw 
displacements of line I. about axis U Analogously, if nJ is the normal between 
I, (not shown) and lc, the angle from nc to nJ is a4/2 and the distance is cQ/2. 
We will make use of these properties in Chapter V, Section 8.
If we consider two sets of homologous triads lb 12, 13 and gb g2, g3 we have 
two different central axes Ц and g<. The following theorem follows: the angle 
and distance between the normals from 1, and g, to s0 are equal respectively to 
the angle and distance between the normals from L and gc to s4. The proof of 
this follows from Fig. 17. Since Z.p4 pc = ZLn, nc = /2, dist | p, pc | = dist | ni nJ = 
^/2, and all the angles and distances are measured about s0, it follows if 
Z.n4pc = a and dist |n,pc| = d, that zLp4n( = (</>.,/2) - a = Z.pcn„ and 
dist |p,n, | = (dy/2)- d = dist|pcnj.
Example 9. Show that the basic lines Г. g*  corresponding to I,, b. I, and gb gJt g„ respectively, 
may be used in the above theorems instead of 1. and g. if the sense of the angle and distance 
between normals is reversed. So for example if the normals from l< and g< to s¥ measure (from the

Example 10. The image screws are similarly Tclated to I, and U as the screws. Specifically, show 
that the angle and distance between the normals from I. and L to s* are the directed angle 
and distance 4»/2.
Example 11. Show that if n, is the normal between I, and ц. and n« is the normal from U to s*. 
then the angle and distance between n, and n< is - 4^/2 and - 4,/2 measured from n, to n« 
about s*.
In Chapter III, Section 10 we introduced the concept of an internal 
line-bisector together with the notion of a directed line. These can be applied 
to the foregoing. We use this to restate our results in the following way: The 
three homologous lines l>, h, h are obtained as reflections of the basic line Iе 
into the sides nb nb ni of the screw triangle. If Г is a directed line it induces 
directions on 1, (i = 1,2,3), and therefore a unique central line U, of L is 
defined; if the direction of Г is reversed the same holds for all 1, and hence we 
have the same central line.

We give ni and n2 an orientation; that on nt will be from Nt to the intersection 
of nj and Su, and similarly for n2. The internal bisector b3 of ni and n2 could be 
called an internal bisector of the screw triangle; it passes through the 
midpoint M of Nb N2.
The internal bisector of A \A} and A £A2 passes through the midpoint К of

MA '2 = 2(MN2) - MA Therefore MK = \(MA 1 + MA'2)= - MA'„ which 
means that К is found by reflecting A * into M.
On the other hand, if we project n,, n2, A ^A *,  AJAi and A2A2, all 
perpendicular to sJ2, on a plane orthogonal to s,2 (Fig. 19), the same argument 
can be used for the angles (i.e., Z.b3n, + Z.b3n2 = 0, Z.n,, A \At + Z.n,m3 = 0, 
etc.). We conclude that the bisector of AJA, and A2A2 is the reflection of 
A iA • into the bisector of n,, n2. The conclusion is: the bisector m3 of 1,, h 
coincides with the reflection of the common perpendicular m3 of s3 and Iе into 
the bisector b3 of the screw triangle. We shall call m3 the isogonally conjugated 
line of m3 with respect to the “vertex” s3 of the screw triangle.
Our result is the following theorem: if 1*  is the basic line of the three 
homologous lines h, 12, 13, if furthermore m. is the common perpendicular of 1*  
and s„ and if ml is the isogonal conjugate of m, with respect to vertex s, of the 
screw triangle, then the line lc of 1,, 12, 13 (which are given a direction in 
accordance with an arbitrarily chosen direction on Г) is the common 
perpendicular of the three lines mJ.
Example 12. Show that the relationship between the lines Г and l( is involutory.
Example 13. Show that the following geometrical theorem holds: if a spatial triangle is given 
with vertices sH if furthermore m, is a line intersecting s, orthogonally (i = 1,2,3) and if mJ is 
isogonally conjugated to m(, then: if m, have a common perpendicular p, the lines m' have a 
common perpendicular p' (the lines p and p' arc said to be isogonally conjugate with respect to 
the triangle).
An interesting special case of the 1*,L  correspondence occurs when the 
three homologous lines !,, 12, 13 have a common normal. Clearly is the 
common normal, and 0, = тг/2, Dt = 0 (i = 1,2,3,4). Taking 0, = ?r/2, we

we have a single infinity of lines /' (or /'•) corresponding to each pair of 
directions A,/c. A similar result follows from (7.8) if we solve for (or /'•) 
instead of /J. To summarize: the locus of lines l„ such that their homologous 
triads each have a single common normal, is a line congruence (whose 
directions are given by the cubic cone (7.7), and location by the single infinity 
of vectors determined by (7.9) and (7.10)). The infinitesimal displacement case 
of this congruence will be studied in Chapter XIII, Section 5; we will prove it 
is a (7.3) congruence. The locus of common normals lc is a corresponding 
congruence in X.
There are several other special cases of interest, these include the further 
restrictions that the displacement of h along L is a pure translation, the 
displacement of E about L is a pure rotation, and combinations of these. The 
analysis of these cases is rather involved, see Roth [1968), and Tsai and 
Roth [1972). We conclude by remarking, without proof, that there are always 
two triads of homologous lines, and only two such triads, such that a set of 
general displacements of E, given by sta, S23, may be obtained by a set of pure 
rotations about 1< and L, see Tsai and Roth [1973), and Veldkamp (1967a).

THE CIRCLE AXES

8. The circle axes
Three homologous points At> A2, A3 are in general the vertices of a 
triangle. Of interest is its circle axis, that is the line m through the 
circumcenter of the triangle and orthogonal to its plane; m is the locus of 
points at equal distances to Ab A2 and Аэ. It is the intersection of the normal 
planes p2, of A2A3, A3A,, AjA2 respectively. We know (from Chapter 
III, Section 4) that p2 and p, are each associated to A, by a non-singular 
correlation. Hence 02 and рэ are corresponding planes of a spatial projectiv­
ity. The locus of their line of intersection is a tetrahedral complex C|. To 
determine its four singular planes we determine when planes p2 and p3 
coincide: one such singular p2 plane is perpendicular to A|A3 and passes 
through the midpoint Ml3 of A, and A3; Рз is perpendicular to AtA2 and 
passes through the midpoint Mi2 of A, and A2. If P? and p3 coincide with one 
plane p, the points A b A2, A3 must be on one line I. However, as MI2 and 
are different points (because A2 and A3 are different) p must also go through 
I; since it is perpendicular to I as well, it is an isotropic plane, passing through 
a tangent t, of the isotropic conic O. The conclusion is: the locus of the circle 
axes m is a tetrahedral complex С»; the faces of its tetrahedron are isotropic 
planes.
As a tetrahedral complex is quadratic the lines m of Ci at infinity are the 
tangents of a conic k'. Such lines are the intersection of two (and therefore of 
three) parallel normal planes. Two normal planes however are parallel if and 
only if Ab A2, A3 are on one line I. We know from the preceding section that 
these lines 1 have their point at infinity on the conic k, the intersection of V and 
the hyperboloid Q(np n2, n3). Hence the conics к and k' in V are polar 
reciprocals with respect to the isotropic conic П. As' Nb N2, N3 are on к it 
follows that k' is an inscribed conic of the triangle P,P2P3. The lines at infinity 
on the faces of the tetrahedron are the common tangents of О and k'. They 
are two pairs of conjugate imaginary lines. The faces of the tetrahedron are 
two pairs of conjugate imaginary planes; its vertices are two pairs of 
conjugate imaginary points; two opposite edges are real, the other two pairs 
are conjugate imaginary; the characteristic cross ratio of the tetrahedral 
complex is a real number.
From any basic point A • follow three homologous points A >, A2, A3 and to 
these there corresponds in general one circle axis m; we shall say that the line 
m is associated with the point A * and conversely A * is associated with m. Let 
B*  be a point on m; then we have

and we have therefore the theorem: if B*  is on the circle axis associated with 
A * then A * is on the circle axis associated with B*.
If A*  is on the twisted cubic c the homologous points Аь A2, Аэ are 
collinear; the planes ph p2, Рз are parallel and the circle axis associated with 
A * is a line of the plane V at infinity. The locus of these lines consists of the 
tangents of the conic k'. If В * is any point of V two of these tangents m' and 
m" pass through it; they are associated with two points A *'  and A *"  on c. In 
view of our theorem the circle axis associated with B*  passes through both 
A *'  and A which means that it is their join. Hence the circle axis associated 
with a point at infinity is a chord of c. Conversely, any chord of c is associated 
with a point of V: namely, the intersection point of the two lines in V which 
are the circle axes associated with the end-points of the chord. It then follows 
that all chords of c are lines of the tetrahedral complex Ci and the tangents of c 
are the circle axes associated with the points of k'. The cone of the complex 
associated with a point of c is the (quadratic) cone of the chords through it.
If the planes , ₽2, coincide they are of course parallel, which means that 
A • is on c. Therefore there must be four points, T, say, i = 1,2,3,4, of c that 
are not associated with a single axis but with all lines of a plane yt; these four 
planes are the faces of the tetrahedron of C|. T is associated with every line of 
y,; in view of our theorem the circle axis associated with any point of y. passes 
through Th which implies that axes pass through Th The conclusion is that 
Tt is a vertex of the tetrahedron.
Summing up we have: the locus of the circle axes of the triads of homologous 
points is a tetrahedral complex C(; the vertices of its tetrahedron are on the 
twisted cubic c; its faces are tangent to the isotropic conic ft.
If we disregard questions of reality we may introduce a projective coordi­
nate system with T as fundamental points; let xt be point coordinates and p*  
line coordinates in this system. If the point A • and the line m are associated 
the coordinates of m are quadratic functions of the coordinates of A *:  this 
follows from the correspondence described at the beginning of this section. 
We know that m is undetermined if A * coincides with a point T,. This means 
that every pti is zero if any three of the four coordinates x, are zero; in other 
words pti are functions of the products xkx, (к/ /). On the other hand every

that the line associated with any point (хьх2,0,0) on the edge TtT2 say 
(different from T} and T2) is the opposite edge Xi = x2 = 0, this is the line for 
which pM = 1 and all other coordinates are zero. From all this it follows that 
the relationship between the point A *(x<)  and the associated line m(p0), for a 
suitable choice of the unit point, reads

РыРп + ргдрм + PmPu = 0 (the fundamental relation for line coordinates).

which by means of (8.3) and (8.4) may be written in other, equivalent forms. 
The conclusion is: a line m of the complex C( is (in general) associated with 
one basic point A*;
 their relationship is birational.
The line m(p0) is the intersection of the planes

belong. This then leads us to conclude that: a point lies on the line associated 
with it if it lies on all quadrics of the pencil. Hence the locus of the basic point 
A * which has equal distances to the corresponding homologous points A t, A2, 
A3 is a biquadratic space curve of the first kind.
9. The radius of a circle
For any planar triangle the radius, r, of the circumscribed circle is given by 
r = J(a/sin a) where a is an interior angle and a is the length of the opposite 
side. Taking А», A2, A3 as the position vectors, in 1, of the homologous set 
А ь А2у A3 we have, from the above formula: the radius of the circle through a 
triple of homologous points is
(9.1) 
r = HI(A3-A2)||(A3-AI)||(A2-AI)!}/|(A3-A,)x(A2-A1)l.
If the points At (i = 1,2,3) are known this expression can be used to compute 
the radius from their position vectors Ah
By squaring this expression we can remove the absolute value restrictions 
and obtain the rationalized equation:
(9.2) 
4г2((Аэ-А1)х(А2-А,)]2-(Аз-А2)2(Аз-А1)2(Аа-А|)2 = 0
since all the A, (i = 1,2,3) can be expressed as linear functions of A * (or if we 
wish one of the A<), this equation represents a sixth order surface embedded 
in 1 (or E,), and is the locus of all A * (or A,) for which the corresponding A, 
(i = 1,2,3) lie on a circle of radius r.
There are two special questions of interest: namely, how small and how 
large can r be?
As r approaches infinity this surface degenerates into the singular quartic 
surface [(A3~ A,)x (A2~ A,)]2 = 0 and the plane at infinity counted twice. 
The only real points on these surfaces lie on the twisted cubic c( and the plane 
cubic cl (discussed in Section 4).
In order to find the minimum value of r we introduce the points tt4, which 
denotes the point where the normal n4 bisects the line connecting A4A*.
 In 
this way we define three points nt (i = 1,2,3) such that they lie on nh and have 
the important property that the circle through тгь тг2, тг3 is always one-half as 
large as the circle through Ah A2, A3. With this definition we have

where it, is the position vector to 7г„ P, the position vector to a point on пи л, 
a unit vector parallel to nb and /x. is a scalar parameter (Fig. 20). It then 
follows that
(9.3) 
A, - Л. = 2(ffj - я,) = 2(P, - Л + p,n, - до).
Equation (9.2) can be written as an explicit function of /x, if we substitute 
(9.3) into (9.2). Now, operating on (9.2) with d/dp, and setting dr/dp, = 0 we 
find the conditions for stationary values of r. The details are rather lengthy 
(they are given by Bottema et al. [1970]), the conclusions are relatively 
simple: The minimum radius rmin is always twice the radius of the smallest 
circle which can be inscribed in the skew lines n, (i = 1,2,3).
There are two distinct cases: if dtf is the largest of the three translations 
(along the screw axes Su, Sn, s3i), then we have either rmin = d„/2 or rmtn > d^/2.

И rm,n = d,J2y the screw axis is collinear with a diameter of “the” smallest 
circle, and there are two smallest circles. Their sets of homologous points 
Ak, Bk (k = 1,2,3) lie on circles of radii d4/2 with centers on st/ ; Aly A,y Bly B, 
all lie on s0 as shown in Fig. 21. Also, the center of each circle coincides with 
the base point of the other.
As long as the distance of nk from тгс (shown in Fig. 21) is less than d,t/2 
there will be two such minimum radius circles. If this distance equals d,J2 the 
circles coincide. However, when nk is at a greater distance, rm,„ > d4/2 and we 
have the second case. In this case the minimum radius points A. are 
characterized by their basic point. A*,
 and center point, Ac, coinciding. In 
addition the center of their тг,-circle, nc, also coincides with A*  and Ac. In 
general there will be al most 12 circles with the property that they touch all 
three n, and yet do not have a screw axis as a diameter. All of these will define 
tt, points (where they touch the n.) which in turn will define sets of 
homologous A„ since their Ac, A *,  irc points all coincide. Each such set, of 
homologous A(, defines a circle with the property that its radius is stationary 
with respect to the radii associated with all neighboring points. The smallest 
of these stationary radii will be the minimum radius, rmm, in the case when 
rmn>d,l/2.
10. An oblique coordinate system
In the analytical sections of this chapter we have used orthogonal coordi­
nate systems. It is possible to reduce the complexity of some of the formulas 
by introducing a special oblique system.
Three positions are completely determined by the three screw axes, sb or by

manner we introduce an oblique (or affine) coordinate system in the following 
way. Let Vo be the plane through n, parallel to n, (i//). As Vo and V/( are 
parallel the six planes are the faces of a parallelepiped (Fig. 22). We take its 
center О as the origin. Furthermore we orient П| so that its positive direction 
is from its intersection with s2 to that with s3, and continue in the same way, 
cyclically, for the positive directions of n2 and n3. The axes of our system 
pass through О parallel to the oriented lines n,. Hence if the edges of the 
parallelepiped are 2a, 2b, 2c the lines n. are given by
(10.1) 
n,: у = b, z = - c; n2: z = c,x = - a; n3: x = a, у = - b.
It follows from the formula for the distance of any point from the origin that 
the equation of the isotropic conic D reads
(10.2) 
x2 + y2+ z2 + 2(yz cos a + zx cos/3 + xy cos y) = w = 0,
in which a is the angle between n2 and n3, /3 the angle between n3 and п», у 
the angle between n, and n2.
The polar line of N, = (1,0,0,0) with respect to D is

origin, and directions such that
X = x + у cos у + z cos /3,
Y = x cos у 4 у 4 z cos a,
Z = x cos /3 4- у cos a + z.

Ox, Oy and Oz are parallel to Si, S2, s*.  Three homologous points A, are the

and (?2, Оз, Оз, Оз follow by cyclic permutation. As P„ PI, given by (11.6)

Plucker coordinates of m are of the fifth order in the parameters. Hence the 
locus of the lines on which there lie three homologous points is a ruled surface 
F of the fifth order, which is as we found before.

We derive from (11.9) the intersection of F and the plane at infinity. If 
М1М2Д3Х 0 the corresponding lines m do not lie in the plane at infinity; the 
direction of any such line is given by Q, : Q2: Qy and for this case the locus of 
the intersections of F with V is the conic k. In the O4t system we use pb p2, Рз 
to denote the directions of m, and since m is parallel to m' we have 
Pt 'Pi ' Рз = 
: bfjLyfjLt: cpL jp2. It follows that the equation for к is ayz +
bzx + cxy = w = 0, in accordance with (11.5).
If P1P2P3 = 0 the corresponding lines, m, are in the plane at infinity; there 
are three such lines. For pi = 0, we have from (11.8) and (11.6), keeping in 
mind that W
*

(11.10) 
(?1 = (?2= Оз= о: = о, O2: o;= - cos fi : cosy;
hence it is the line mi joining Li = (l,0,0,0) to N, = (l,cosy,cos/3,0). In а 
similar manner we could get the other two lines. The three lines L,N( pass 
through H = (cos /3 cos y, cos у cos a, cos a cos /3,0). All this is in accordance 
with Section 5.
Until now we dealt with finite homologous points. If A * = (x •» у *,  z *,  0) is 
in V we know that At is found as follows. The polar line of Ni(l,0,0,0) is 
X = 0. Hence the join Nt A * is
(11.11) 
x = x-X
 + A, y = ye, z = z,
 
w=0.
*
*
Л = 00 gives Ni, A = 0 the intersection with the polar line, and A = Xе gives 
A*.
 The reflection of A * is therefore given by A = -Xе. Hence
A,: x = xe-2Xe, у = ye, z = ze, w =0,
and similarly
(11.12) 
A2: x = xe, у = ye-2Ye, z = z\ w =0,
A3: x = x*,
 у = ye, z = ze-2Ze, w =0.

12. Three mutually orthogonal screw axes
Until now we have supposed that the screw axes s, determining the three 
positions of a space are three lines in general position. As we have remarked 
before, there are several special cases. If the three s, pass through one point 
we deal with spherical kinematics, if they are mutually parallel we have 
essentially the case of plane kinematics. Both subjects will be considered 
separately in Chapters VII and VIII.
In this section we consider another special case, namely that in which the 
three axes Si are mutually orthogonal. The kinematic meaning of this is 
obviously that the transformation of any position into another is a screw 
displacement the rotational part of which is a half turn. Furthermore n, is 
parallel to s,. The parallelepiped considered in Section 10 is rectangular. The 
oblique coordinate systems OXyz and Oxrt coincide and they are now 
Cartesian systems. In the formulas of Sections 10 and 11 we have cos a = 
cos/3 =cosy =0. With these simplifictions this special case is particularly 
suitable for illustrating the general theory.
From the formulas (10.6)-(10.8) it follows that if A*(X

(Xе, 6, -c), (-a, Ye,c), (a,-6,Ze)
and we have from (10.10), for the three homologous points

(12.2) 
A2 = (- Xе - 2a, Y\ -Z  + 2c),
*
Аз=(-Хе + 2а, - Ye-26,Ze).
Furthermore it follows from (11.2) that the locus of A * such that Ab A2, Аз 
are collinear is the twisted cubic
Xе = ад2дз(д2-дз), Ye = ЬдздХдз-Д|),
(12.3) 
Ze = СД|Д2(Д!-д2), We = /x!/x2^3.
The fifth order ruled surface F on whose generators three collinear homolog­
ous points lie follows from (11.6), (11.7) and (11.9); for ^ид2дз / Owe obtain
О| = аМ2Мэ, Q2=6miMj, Оз=сД1Д2,
<?!= -бед?, <?2= -сад2, (?;= -abpy.
The conclusion is that the surface F is degenerate and consists of a quadric 
regulus and three pencils of lines in V. The regulus is a hyperboloid; from 
(11.4) and (11.5) it follows that its equation is
(12.5) 
a YZ + bZX + cXY + abcW2 = 0.
We remark furthermore that the curve c' of the third order and the set of lines 
C' of the third class are trivial in this case, their equations being XYZ = 0 and 
u,u2u3 = 0 respectively.
So far we have only applied this special case to the results of the general 
theory of Section 11. We shall now develop for this case an analytic treatment 
of the tetrahedral complex of circle axes — we have not done this for the 
general case in view of its complexity.

If, however, G = 0 the associated circle axis of A * is undetermined. Hence 
the vertices Tt of the tetrahedron are those points of c which satisfy

For the invariants I and J of the biquadratic form g we obtain
(12.18) 
61 = (a2 + b2 + c2)2, 
36J = 54a262c2 - (a2 + h2 + c2)’,
which gives us for the discriminant
(12.19) 
К = J2 - (1/6)F = (l/12)a2b2c2{27a2b2c2 -(a2 + b2 + c2/},
which implies that R is only equal to zero if a = b = c. The conclusion is: if 
a, b and c are not all equal, the equation (12.16) has four different roots and 
the four vertices of the tetrahedron are distinct. The equality of a, b, and c 
occurs only when all three screws have equal translations.
If (12.16) is satisfied the three planes p, coincide; their common coordinates 
follow from (12.8) or (12.9) after substituting (12.3) and are seen to be

From (12.20) and (12.16) it follows that the plane is indeed isotropic.
The biquadratic equation (12.17) can always be solved, but the roots are 
complicated functions of a, 6, c. If two of these lengths are equal a certain 
simplification takes place. The solution is simple if a = b = c; we obtain two

n3 all coincide. Hence the homologous points A(, since they are the reflections 
of the basic point A • into n6 coincide and we have no displacements at all. 
Therefore, this special configuration of the three lines s, can only have a 
meaning when we deal with infinitesimal displacements.
To discuss the situation we start with two infinitesimal displacements S», S31 
(further on denoted by S» and S2) and ask for a third S!2 (denoted by S3) such 
that the result of the three is no displacement at all. The condition can readily 
be found if we make use of the Ball vectors (Chapter II, Section 4) of a 
infinitesimal displacement. If (LbM() corresponds to S4 the velocity t>. of an 
arbitrary point A with position vector p is given by
(13.1) 
v. = Ltp  + M„
*
and hence the condition for no displacement, written in terms of velocity, 
reads
(13.2) 
L, x p + M, + L2 x p + M2 + L, x p + Mi = 0.
Since this must be valid for any p, this implies
(13.3) 
Lt + L24-L3 = 0,
(13.4) 
М, + М2+Мз = 0.

(13.7) 
л • Mi 4- n' • Lj = 0, л • M2+ л' • L2 = 0.
From (13.3), (13.4), (13.5) and (13.7) we derive
(13.8) 
Л’Ь3 = 0, л • М3 4- n’ • L3 = 0,
but these imply that n intersects s3 orthogonally. Hence the three axes s, have a 
common perpendicular and therefore they build the configuration which was 
the starting point of this section.
Obviously the infinitesimal screw motion S3 is determined by Si and S2. To

specified by the rotation vectors o>., the pitches a, and the points (4,0,0), 
i = 1,2,3. If Si and S2 are given, S3 is determined by (13.9), (13.12) and (13.14).
It follows in particular that if Si and S2 are pure rotations (ai = cr2 = 0), S3 is 
in general not a pure rotation. It is only a pure rotation in the case when 
(a, - a2)sin /3=0, hence Si and s2 must either intersect or be parallel. In the 
latter case (/3 = 0), s3 is parallel to st and s2 and we have furthermore the scalar 
relationships

This special case is known as the Aronhold-Kennedy theorem. If s, and s2 
intersect (<2i = a2 = a) we have a3 = a: s^Sj,s3 pass through one point. To 
summarize: S3 can only be a pure rotation if Si and S2 are pure rotations which 
are either parallel or intersect. These cases correspond respectively to planar 
and spherical displacements.
In general three positions theory we have met the fundamental theorem 
that three screw axes determine the three screw displacements completely. In 
the special case at hand the question arises whether the three axes s, of 
instantaneous screws (having a common perpendicular) determine the dis­
placements. In other words: can we find the scalars and a, if the directions

of St, S2, S3. If we substitute in turn the two roots of (13.26) into the second

equation for Y and Z. The conclusion is that the locus consists of two lines l( 
and l2 intersecting Ox orthogonally. As the line l3 at infinity of the Ovz-plane 
(X = W = 0) also satisfies (13.25), the complete locus consists of three lines of 
which two are in general skew, while the third intersects the other two. The 
twisted cubic of the general case is in this case therefore degenerate. We 
remark that lt and l2 may be either real or imaginary. Moreover they depend 
on the configuration of the three axes st, S2, s3 and on the values of a, (and not 
only on their differences) as well.

If three consecutive positions of a point P are collinear it passes through an

satisfies the condition that its velocity and acceleration vectors coincide.

The point at infinity is (0,0,1,0), on the screw axis, in accordance with the 
general case wherein the cubic passes through the points at infinity of the 
three screw axes.
An inflection tangent joins a point (x, y, z, w) on c and the point at infinity 
(- y, x, сто, 0). It follows from (14.3) that the locus of the latter is a conic k. The 
Pliicker coordinates of the inflection tangent are polynomials in т of the fifth 
order and the locus of the tangents is therefore a quintic ruled surface F, in 
accordance with the general case.

CHAPTER V
FOUR AND MORE POSITIONS
1. Choice of screw axes
In Chapter III we saw that the relative displacement between two arbitrary 
positions depends upon six parameters. Furthermore, a convenient set of such 
parameters is given by the elements of a screw displacement: the four 
coordinates of the line collinear with the screw axis, the rotation angle, and 
the displacement along the axis. Clearly then we may choose any line in 
3-space and find a double infinity of possible displacements which have this 
line as their screw axis. Every displacement however generally determines a 
unique screw axis.
In Chapter IV we have seen that, provided we exclude pure translational 
displacements, three separate positions have their relative configurations 
completely determined by the set of three lines coinciding with the axes of the 
displacement — screws sn, Sw, s31. In other words, a general set of three lines, 
no two of which are parallel, uniquely defines the relative displacements 
between the three positions 1,2, and 3. Each ordered set of three lines defines 
a different ordered set of relative displacements, and reciprocally, each 
ordered set of three positions defines a unique ordered set of three lines. A 
bi-rational correspondence of this kind between ordered sets of lines and 
displacements of a body exists only for three positions. One way to account 
for this is to compare the number of parameters associated with a set of lines 
to the number associated with a corresponding set of displacements: Dis­
placements 1 —► 2 and 2—>3 depend upon 2x6= 12 parameters. Clearly these 
12 parameters are sufficient to determine the entire configuration defined by 
three positions 1,2, 3. The three lines (coinciding with s», s3I, S|2) depend upon 
3x4=12 parameters. We see then that the relative displacements between 
three positions, and a configuration of three lines both depend upon 12 
parameters. This then accounts for the fact that any three lines may be used as 
axes and that they uniquely and entirely determine the displacements.

FOUR AND MORE POSITIONS
(CH. 5,12
For four positions, there are six screw axes (su, s», s(4, 
s24, sM) associated
with the relative displacements. However, the three displacements l-*2,
 
2—»3, 3—► 4 determine the four positions, so the entire configuration depends 
upon 3x6= 18 parameters. This also implies that we are free to choose only 
four and one-half (since 18/4 = 4.5) and not all six of the screw-axis lines. 
Because a configuration of six arbitrary lines involves 6 x 4 = 24 arbitrary 
parameters, it cannot generally coincide with the six screw axes associated 
with four positions (which are determined by only 18 arbitrary parameters). In 
the next section we show which sets of six lines can in fact be sets of four 
position axes.
2. The configuration of the screw axes
In the previous section we have seen that it is possible to arbitrarily specify 
at most 4.5 axes; this means we can choose four axes arbitrarily and in 
addition we have two free parameters at our disposal. Once the four axes and 
two additional parameters are specified, we expect the four positions, and 
hence all six axes, to be determined. There are in fact two different cases 
depending upon which four axes are chosen arbitrarily:
Case 1. Three axes form a screw triangle. If three of the axes refer to the 
same three positions they form a screw triangle of the type discussed in 
Chapter IV. st/ and s/4 are coinciding lines and the same triangle follows from 
either ordering of i and /. Hence there are actually only four possible screw 
triangles: SuShSb, Si2S24s14, SijSmSu, and 
If any three of our four lines
belong to such a set, they uniquely and completely determine the three 
positions to which they correspond. The two remaining parameters may be 
taken as the remaining freedoms in the choice of a fifth axis which is already 
restricted (as we shall soon see) to intersect a fixed line at a right angle. 
However, it will turn out that these two free parameters are most simply 
taken as the angular and linear displacements (ф, d) associated with the 
fourth screw axis (i.e., the one that does not belong to the screw triangle). The 
sixth axis follows uniquely once any five axes are known. We now illustrate 
this with arguments which rely on the screw triangle geometry developed in 
Chapter IV.
We take four arbitrary lines as, for example, the axes s», Si3, sn, sM. Since 
S12, Sm, s,3 form a screw triangle, the screw displacements (ф!2, dt2), (фи, dn), 
and (фи, d2i) are also known. If we now use the remaining two parameters to 
specify (Ф34, 4м), enough is known about triangle s^SuSm to determine axis sH 
and displacements (фм, d14). These follow uniquely from the geometry of the

CONFIGURATION OF THE SCREW AXES

screw triangle. Similarly, from triangle snsMs.M, the axis s24 and associated 
displacements are now known. Alternatively, if 1Э is the normal between s« 
and s.m» screwing line h about axis s» by an amount (- фи/2, - d23/2) yields the 
line 12 which intersects s23 at a right angle and (because s23s.mS24 form a screw 
triangle) also Sj4 at a right angle. Since l2 is uniquely determined by the 
original choice of four lines, it follows that s^ may be any line which intersects 
a known line (12) at a right angle. The locus of all possible lines s24 is then 
clearly a linear line congruence with axis at 12. (Such a congruence is also 
called a (1,1) congruence, since only one line of the congruence lies in an 
arbitrarily situated plane and only one line passes through an arbitrary point.) 
If we select one line of the congruence to be s24 we use up our two free 
parameters, and the remaining parts of the configuration of six axes and their 
associated screw displacements follow uniquely. Choosing a line of the s24 
congruence is equivalent to choosing (фм, сЛ4). Conversely, we now see that if 
we choose (фм, dM) as our two free parameters, the effect is the same as 
selecting a line of the linear congruence for s24. Clearly a similar argument 
could be used to first determine that s14 must be a line of a linear congruence 
and then show that Sj4 follows uniquely. The conclusion is: if four screw axes 
are chosen such that three belong to the same screw triangle, the remaining two 
axes are members of linear congruences. There are two freedoms remaining in 
the system, and if these are used to specify one member of either congruence, the 
fifth and sixth axes follow uniquely.
Case 2. No three of the four specified axes belong to the same screw 
triangle. This is the more symmetric and by far the more interesting of the two 
cases. If the axes are paired so that common normals are drawn between axes 
with common subscripts we have a closed configuration composed of eight 
lines as shown in Fig. 24. Only four of these lines are independent, the other 
four being common normals; such a figure can be considered to be a spatial 
quadrilateral. The common normals are drawn only between axes with a 
common subscript. Two such axes which have a subscript in common are said 
to be adjacent. Axes that do not have a common subscript are said to be 
complementary. There are three pairs of complementary axes s^s^, s13s24, s14s23, 
and every spatial quadrilateral with non-adjacent axes formed from two such 
pairs is called a complementary screw quadrilateral. Fig. 24 shows the general 
scheme of such a quadrilateral. The only restriction on the subscripts is that 
i/j/k/l. This means there are three different possible configurations 
depending upon if i, j, k, / are 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 4, 3; or 1, 3, 2, 4. This follows 
from the fact that there are three sets of complementary axes taken two al a 
time, any other permutation of 1,2, 3,4 yields one of these configurations.

FOUR AND MORE POSITIONS
(CH. 5, §2
If we select four axes so that no three form a screw triangle, then the four must 
form a complementary screw quadrilateral. The question remains what are the 
restrictions on the choice of the remaining two axes. Using the notation of 
Fig. 24, we seek to determine s,k and s/f. The answer again lies in the property 
of the screw triangle. Taking first s^ we note that s,k forms screw triangles 
with axes s№ s/k as well as sh, sk/. If we draw the normals in these two triangles 
we have lines iH kj and i2, k2 as shown in Fig. 25. From the geometry of screw 
triangle sv, s<k, s)k it follows that, regardless of where s*  actually is, the angle 
and distance between ih k, must be respectively (ф<к/2, d<k/2), measured from 
it to kt. Similarly triangle sth slk, sk/ requires that the angle and distance 
between i2, k2 also be (ф,к/2, d<k/2), measured from i2 to k2; which means that 
the angle and distance between iH kt must equal respectively the angle and 
distance between i2, k2. In addition, since lines ib kb i2, k2 are all normal to and 
intersect the same line (sjk) it follows that the angle and distance between in i2, 
measured from it toward i2, will equal respectively the angle and distance 
between ki, k2, measured from kj toward k2. We now have two restrictions on 
the location of slk, these restrictions are in terms of the equality of two angles 
and two distances and in no way imply knowledge of the actual values of these 
angles or distances.
We conclude: all possible axes stk must the situated so that the angle and 
distance between normals to them from one pair of adjacent axes are equal to 
respectively the angle and distance between normals from the other pair of 
adjacent axes. If any one pairing of adjacent axes satisfies this condition the 
other pairings will also satisfy this condition.

THE SCREW CONE

This then implies that the locus of slk will be a line congruence, since it is a 
line and its locus depends upon two scalar conditions. In the next three 
sections we derive the equations and properties of this congruence. In 
Sections 3 and 4 we deal only with the rotational aspects; in Section 5 we 
introduce the condition on the distances.
3. The screw cone
Analytic expressions for the equality of the angle between ib k, and the 
angle between i2, k2 are most easily obtained by first considering only the 
angles, and not the distances, between the lines. This is facilitated by using the 
spherical indicatrix of the quadrilateral. In other words, since we are only 
interested in angles, we can represent any line by a vector parallel to it and 
passing through the origin of coordinates. We use, therefore, a set of 
intersecting vectors slk, skh sh parallel to the corresponding axes sf„ Sa, Sy, s«. 
From triangle s4/, s/k, slk we have then
(3.1) ((iy x ) x (sik x ))/((fy x srt) • (slk x sik)) = tan (</>lk /2),
where sik is the unit vector parallel to axis Sa- Equation (3.1) may be expanded

Repeating for triangle sh. Su,.^ we get a similar expression in which stl 
replaces s,h and sk/ replaces slk. Equating bbth of these expressions and 
clearing the denominator yields

(3.3) 
_ x sk/) • s,k ] [(s^ • s,k )(sA • sA) - (sti • slk )(s/k • sA)] = 0.
In (3.3), slk is the only unknown. Since it appears as a homogeneous cubic 
function, the directions of all possible axes sA must be parallel to the rulings 
of a cubic cone. This equation defines the only possible directions for an axis 
for which Z.ii,ki = Z.i2, k2. From (3.3) it follows that s/k, sk, skl are also 
rulings of this same cubic cone. By the symmetry of our argument it follows 
that the sixth axis s/( must also be parallel to one of the rulings of this same 
cone. Hence all six axes are parallel to rulings of the same cubic cone. It may 
also be shown that all three complementary screw quadrilaterals associated 
with a given set of six axes define the same cubic cone. It seems logical then to 
name such a cone: the screw cone.
4. The correspondence between axis direction and rotation angle
We now explore some of the properties of the screw cone by asking the 
following question: Assuming a complementary screw quadrilateral is known 
and axis slk unknown, if a given rotation angle ф,к is specified, how many of 
the cone directions (i.e., screw cone rulings) are possible directions for sA ?
From (3.2) it follows that any arbitrary value for ф1к requires sA to be 
parallel to the directions of the fourth-order cone:
(4.1) 
[(st/ x s,k)s, k]2si-tan2(</>,k/2)((s,/ • s/k)(sA)~(s4/ • sA)(sA -sA)]2 = 0.
*
This cone intersects the screw cone in 4 x 3 = 12 lines. However the directions 
s0 and s/k are double lines of (4.1) so they count as four of the twelve 
intersections. Since these four are spurious, we have in general at most eight 
directions for any value of tan2(<£,k/2); four for + ф,к and four for - ф1к. 
Hence, for a given value of the rotational angle ф1к there are at most four 
directions for sA. By permutation of subscripts in (4.1) we can see that there 
are at most 24 (i.e., 6x4) directions on the screw cone — four for each 
screw — for which the corresponding rotation angle has a given value.
There are two special cases: ф1к = n and ф<к = 2ir. When ф,к = it the fourth 
order cone degenerates into the quadric cone

counted twice. We still have four directions, the difference in this case is that 
the &k = + tt and фА = - тт directions coincide, and so the eight directions 
for ± 4>tk become the same four lines counted twice.
When <Дк = 2тт, the fourth order cone (4.1) degenerates into the imaginary 
quadric si - 0, and the plane
(4.3) 
(s„ x sA)‘ $k =0
counted twice. This plane (4.3) cuts the screw cone in one real line other than 
sv and s,k. The conclusion is then, when ф,к = 2тг there is only one possible 
direction for sA and this direction is the same for + 2тг and - 2tt. We will call 
such directions tt-directions, since ф1к/2 = ± tt for such axes. The tt-direction 
can be determined most simply if we realize that using triangle sfc, skb s.k in 
(3.2) would result in (4.3) being
(4.4) 
(stt x =0.
The tt-direction is then obtained as the intersection of the planes (4.3) and 
(4.4). From these equations it follows clearly that the tt-direction is normal to 
the normals to sv, sfk and sb, shl respectively.
If Ф.к—>0 the corresponding direction approaches а я-direction, since 
tan(</>lk/2)—► 0. The rr-direction is the only possible direction for slk when ф,к is 
either ±2tt or ±0. There are six lines on the screw cone which represent 
tt-directions, one for each screw.
5. The distance condition
In Section 2 we saw that axis slk must satisfy a condition which was phrased 
in terms of the respective equivalence of two angles and two distances. We 
have so far been dealing with only the angle condition. We turn now to the 
distance part of the restriction. We proceed by determining the coordinates of 
the normals to s*  from the relevant screw axes, and then deriving expressions 
for the distances between the normals. This problem was first solved by Roth 
[1967a], here we give a new derivation. In Chapter XIII, Section 3 we 
illustrate how to derive this same result using a process called dualization.
Using screw axes sy, s/k, and s,k we will develop an expression for 
(d,k/2)sec2(<ftk/2). Recalling, from Section 2 and Fig. 25, that d,k/2 is the 
distance between i( and k,, and that фл/2 is the angle between i, and k, (both 
measured from ь towards k,), we first determine i, and к». Since i( is the 
common perpendicular between sQ and slk we define it in terms of the line

We now have the rather simple result: only lines which belong to the 
congruence defined by equations (5.14) and (5.15) can be screw axis s,k. Eq. 
(5.15) in effect is the translational displacement (i.e., dlk) condition, but it is 
only valid for lines which are parallel to rulings of the screw cone.
6. The screw congruence
It remains for us to study eq. (5.15) in order to better understand the 
properties of the congruence of screw axes.
The Pliicker vector-coordinates of the line which is the axis s(k are rlk, s/k. 
Eq. (5.15) is homogeneous in these coordinates: each term either contains 
cubic terms in sikt or quadratic terms in slk multiplied by linear terms in f4. 
Hence (5.15) represents a cubic line complex. The properties of interest to us 
become most apparent if we substitute for s'k

Here К and are respectively a vector and scalar, both of these are known 
since they are determined by s,*,  s0, s,*,  s(/, slk. Hence, each direction s,k of the

possible axes s,*.  The result is then: given the direction of s(k, eq. (6.2) 
represents an infinity of coplanar lines, all parallel to s(k, any one of which may 
be the screw axis s«

 This situation is illustrated in Fig. 26 where one of the 
elements of the screw cone has been selected (shown in heavy), and this in

THE SCREW CONGRUENCE
123
Equation (6.2) allows us to determine the order of the screw congruence: 
By fixing p,k we determine the restriction on all axes which pass through a 
point (for which p,k is the position vector). For any general value of plk, (6.2) 
represents a cubic cone of s,k with vertex at the origin. Hence all possible 
screw axes through an arbitrary point are given by the directions common to 
(6.2) (with p,k given) and the screw cone, provided we exclude those directions 
for which ct = 0 or c2 = 0. Two such cones intersect, in general, in nine lines 
(counting both real and imaginary intersections). We conclude then that 
through a general point, given by plk, there are nine possible directions for s,k. 
Which is to say that nine lines of the congruence pass through a general point, 
this means its order is nine.
In order to determine the class of the congruence, we consider an arbitrary 
plane P. Any plane Po, parallel to P and passing through the apex of the screw 
cone, intersects the cone in three lines. These three lines determine three 
possible directions for sik. Substituting these in turn into (6.2) we obtain three 
planes each of which cuts P in a different line. Hence three lines of the 
congruence lie in an arbitrary plane. The class is therefore three, and the screw 
congruence is a (9,3) congruence.
This congruence is the intersection of two cubic complexes, both having the 
plane V at infinity as a singularity. One complex is that of all lines parallel to 
the generators of the screw cone; it consists of all lines intersecting a cubic 
curve к in V. Obviously every line in V not only belongs to the complex but it 
must be counted thrice because it intersects к three times. Hence this complex 
has V (i.e., the lines of V) as a three-fold manifold.
The other cubic complex is given by (5.15) (and (5.11)). In its equation the 
components of appear (only) linearly. This means that the lines of V are 
double lines of this complex. Hence the intersection of the two complexes 
contains every line of V 3x2 = 6 times. Their complete intersection, in 
general a (9,9) congruence, is therefore degenerated into a (0,6) and the 
required (9,9) - (0,6) = (9,3) congruence.
Example 1. 
Show that the cubic complex given by (5.15) is built up of pencils of pa
one in each direction. (Hint: The lines, of the complex, through a point are the rulers of a cubic 
cone. If the point is in V this cone degenerates into a pencil in V, counted twice, and a third pencil 
in space.)
Example 2. 
Confirm that the class of the screw congruence is three by use of the
argument: consider an arbitrary plane W and its line of intersection n with V. The lines of the 
complex (5.15) in W are the tangents of a (rational) curve c, of class 3, and obviously n is a double 
tangent of this curve. The line n has three intersections S, (i - 1,2,3) with Ic. We must consider 
the tangents to c> through S(. Of the three tangents through, say St, two coincide and only one is 
not in V. Hence in W there appear three lines of the congruence, which confirms that its class is 
three.

(CH. 5, §6
Choosing the position of the axis sik (i.e., p,k in (6.2)) determines the 
displacement parameter d,k as well. Hence p,k and dlk are related; we examine 
this correspondence: If we choose d,k then, for every direction slk, equation 
(5.10) yields a linear equation in st*  and therefore, by virtue of (6.1), in p,k, i.e., 
the point p,k lies in a plane. The intersection of this plane and the plane given 
by (6.2) is a line. To each displacement dik there therefore corresponds one 
location for each direction s(k. Thus for any d,k there is an infinite number of 
possible axes sA; one corresponding to each direction of the screw cone.
Once the fifth axis is chosen, cases 1 and 2 (see Section 2) become identical 
and clearly the sixth axis follows uniquely. So if we choose four arbitrary axes, 
which define a complimentary screw quadrilateral, and use the two remaining 
freedoms to choose one line from the (9,3) congruence (as the fifth axis), the 
set of displacements associated with four positions is uniquely defined. For a 
given set of four positions all three complementary screw quadrilaterals define 
the same congruence; all six screws belong to this same congruence.
We have already seen that there exist six so-called tt-directions. Corre­
sponding to each such direction is a line which is a common normal between 
two opposite sides of a complementary screw quadrilateral (a side is the 
normal between two adjacent screws). These six ir-lines belong to the 
congruence, and have the additional property that the displacement along 
them can only be null.
From the principle of kinematic inversion it follows that the six screw axes 
(su, sl3, su, sL, sj4, sU) in the moving system E} form analogous configurations 
to the foregoing. In fact there are image-screw triangles and image-screw 
congruences associated with the moving system. All the relationships between 
the axes are analogous to those in the fixed system 2. These configurations of 
axes move with the system and exist in each of the four positions E^ E3> 
E<. Viewed from 2 these configurations are all different, however, the 
relative positions of the axes are the same in all positions Eh and we can speak 
of the moving configuration. The equations for the congruence, of image 
screw axes, in E, follow from (5.14) and (5.15) if we replace S/k, S,k, Sh, Ski, Si/, 
$A, sA, s/<, sk/ by sjk, $;k, sk, sU s//, s/*,  sj*
, The superscript i indicates 
the values we would get under the inverse displacement when 2 is in the 
position corresponding to Et.
Although the idea of obtaining the image screws by use of inverse 
displacements is conceptually simple, for actual computations and graphical 
constructions the following procedure is often more useful: To obtain the 
image screws in Eh we take the coordinate system in E, congruent with the 
system in 2. This means that all /-subscripted vectors coincide with their

= л'ц s'h = sA ). Each of
the remaining image vectors can be obtained by a reflection. For example, by 
reflecting s/k into the normal between s(/ and slk (subscript i because we want 
the image in Eh subscripts / and к because we are dealing with s/k) we obtain 
si*  whose coordinates are f)k, r£.
Example 3. 
Show that for a given set of four positions, the screw-axis congruence inter
congruence of image screw-axes in (at most) nine (real) lines. Show that in general only three of 
these are screws for the given set of positions.
Example 4. 
Under what conditions will more than three of the above mentioned interse
screw axes?
Example 5. 
Show that in general no more than three screws can be perpendicular to
direction.
Example 6. 
Verify that if four screws are perpendicular to one direction the screw co
degenerates (into a linear and quadratic congruence, or three linear ones). Does this imply any 
degeneracy in the image congruence?
Example 7. 
Show that when the screw axes are concurrent and the translation along ea
is null, the screw congruence degenerates into a ruling which is the screw cone. (This is the case 
called sphencal kinematics, see Chapter VII). Similarly, for the image congruence show we have 
the same degeneracy.
Example 8. 
By limit reasoning, deduce that when the point of concurrency (referred 
previous example) is at infinity the screw cone becomes a cubic cylinder. (The planes normal to 
the generators of this cylinder intersect it in the circular-cubics developed in the chapter on planar 
kinematics. Chapter VIII). Similarly, for the image congruence deduce the analogous result.
7. Homologous points
A point A of E has four positions Ab A2, A3, A4 in the fixed space 2. The 
coordinates Xh Y„ Z, of A, are linear functions of the coordinates x, y, z of 
A. The condition for the coplanarity of A, (i = 1,2,3,4) reads |X, YtZt 1| = 
0. Developing this 4x4 determinant we obtain: the locus of a point A in E 
such that its four homologous positions are in one plane of 2 is a cubic surface 
H. Strictly speaking the locus consists of H and the plane at infinity of E all 
points of which have of course coplanar positions. This is confirmed if we 
make use of homogeneous coordinates.
In Chapter IV we have shown that the locus of A such that three positions 
are collinear is a twisted cubic c. If three of the four points A, (i = 1,2,3,4) 
are collinear, the four points are coplanar. Hence if c> is the twisted cubic 
determined by the positions E2, Ey, E<\ c2 is the cubic determined by positions 
3, 4, 1; and so on, we obtain: the four twisted cubics c, are curves on H.
The cubic Ci intersects the plane at infinity of E in the points Ри, Рм, P42 on 
S23, sM, S42 respectively. From this it follows that the plane cubic which is the 
intersection of H and the plane at infinity passes through the six points Py.

There are in general no finite points A of E such that all four A, 
(i = 1,2,3,4) are collinear, because A must satisfy four conditions in this 
case. (This is the same as saying that in general the four c*  do not have a 
common finite point). However if A is at infinity so are all A„ and there are 
only two conditions in this case. It then follows, as we shall show in Chapter 
VII on spherical kinematics, that there are six such points in the plane at 
infinity.
The four positions At (i = 1,2,3,4) of a point A(x, y, z, w) of the moving 
space E are in general the vertices of a tetrahedron T in the fixed space S. Let 
the circumcenter of T be the point M; it is the intersection of the perpendicu­
lar bisector planes of the edges. M may be found as the intersection of the 
normal planes of AtA2, A2A> and A3A4. We know from Chapter III that the 
coordinates of these planes are linear functions of x, y, z, w. Hence the four 
homogeneous coordinates of M are cubic functions of x, y, z, w.
The points M in the fixed space and A in the moving space have the 
property that | MAt | = | MA 21 = | MA31 = | MA41, this constant distance being 
the radius of the circumsphere of T. If we interchange the roles of the two 
spaces, that is if we consider the inverse motion, this implies that A is the 
circumcenter of the four positions of M with respect to E. This means that its 
coordinates are cubic functions of those of M. The conclusion is: there exists a 
birational cubic relationship between A and M.
Analytically, the conditions I MAJ = |MA2| = |MA J = |MA4| may be writ­
ten as (MAJ2 - (MA|)2 = 0, j = 2,3,4 which in terms of position vectors M 
and A, (in £, from the origin of coordinates to points M and А», respectively)

are all (3 x 3) determinants (with the /'h row elements shown) whose elements 
may each be written (using (8.2) of Chapter 1) as linear homogeneous 
functions of the coordinates of A, i.e., (x, y, z, w). Similarly, using the inverse 
motion (7.2) gives us the coordinates of A as the ratio of two cubic functions 
of the coordinates of M. The cubic nature of this (1,1) correspondence 
between A and M implies that points on an n,h order surface in E correspond 
to points on a 3n,h order surface in 2, and vice versa.
*
In particular it follows that the locus of the points A corresponding to the 
points M of a plane is a cubic surface. If the locus of M is the plane at infinity 
the locus of the corresponding points A is the cubic surface H considered in 
the first paragraph of this section and given by eq. (7.2) as H =0. On the other 
hand all points A at infinity correspond to those of a cubic surface embedded 
in 2. When M is at infinity the corresponding point A lies on H (embedded in 
E) and has its four homologous positions A, (i = 1,2,3,4) on a plane in 2 
with the directions (Gx, Gv, Gz).
The circumcenter M is determined as the intersection of the normal planes 
of A|A2, AiAj, At At (i.e., (7.1)) the coordinates of which are linear in 
x, y, z, w. It may be that these three planes have a line 1 in common, which 
implies that any point of I has equal distance to the four points A,; obviously 
this can only occur if the A, (i = 1,2,3,4) are coplanar and also lie on a circle. 
The analytic condition is that the rank of the 4 x 3-matrix of the coordinates, 
of the three normal planes (i.e., (7.1)), is only 2. The necessary and sufficient 
conditions for the rank of eq. (7.1) to be 2 are that Gx = 0, Gv - 0, Gz = 0, 
H = 0 and that at least one (2 x 2) minor of the system have a non-zero 
determinant. Alternatively, a rank of 2 is guaranteed by Gz=0, H = 0 
provided their common (2x2) determinants do not all vanish. We use this 
latter condition in our analysis:
In general two cubic surfaces such as Gz and H (represented here by 
equations Gz = 0, H = 0) intersect in a ninth order curve, however in this case 
the curve degenerates into two curves of lower order: a cubic Iz and a sextic 
к. The cubic curve Iz is spurious for our purposes, since it is the locus of 
points for which Gz = 0, H = 0, but Gx 0, Gv/ 0. The cubic follows from 
the two common 2 x 2-minors of Gz and H; setting them to zero we have

These represent two quadratic surfaces which intersect in the cubic curve Iz 
and the line X2- Xi = 0, Y2- Y| = 0. In general, Gz and H will not be zero 
for points on this line, but must vanish for points on the cubic Iz. So we have, 
by our method of analysis, introduced an extraneous cubic Iz. The remaining 
part of the intersection of H = 0, Gz = 0 is a sextic к. Hence the theorem: the 
locus of the points A such that the four homologous points A. (i = 1,2,3,4) are 
on a circle is a curve к of the sixth order lying on the surface H embedded in E.
к is a singular curve of the cubic relationship between A and M: any point 
of к corresponds to all points of a line 1; the locus of all such lines I is a ruled 
surface (of “singular” lines) in 2.
Conversely, there is a singular sixth order curve in 2 which is the locus of 
the points M which correspond to the points of a line, and all such lines form 
a ruled surface in E.

the cubic surface in 1 corresponding to this plane contains six singular lines I.
A curve such as к, the points of which are singular with regard to a given 
(1,1) correspondence, is called the “fundamental curve” of the correspon­
dence. It is easy to show that к has a genus of 3 if we apply the condition 
2 (p' - p) = (n' - n) (Ni 4- N2 - 4) (see Semple and Roth [1949, pg. 91]), which 
relates the orders n and n't and genera p and p' of the two curves which 
together are the complete intersection of two surfaces of order Nt and N2\ we 
have: Nj = 3 (H = 0), N2 = 3 (Gz = 0); n = 3, p = 0 (since Iz is a twisted 
cubic), n' = 6 (к is a sextic).
If a point of E corresponds to a plane in 1 the rank of the 4 x 3-matrix 
given by eq. (7.1) is only 1. This requires that all the (2x2) determinants 
vanish, but this is impossible under a general displacement. Hence there is no 
point A which generally corresponds to a plane, and к is the only singular 
locus, of A, in regard to the (A, M) reciprocal cubic correspondence.
8. Homologous planes and lines
The four homogeneous coordinates of a plane in E are linear functions of 
those in I. Therefore if four positions of E with respect to 1 are given, the 
locus of the planes in E such that each quadruple of homologous planes

passes through one point is the set of tangent planes to a surface of the fourth 
order. It has four subsets, each being a cubic torse, such that in three of the 
four positions the homologous planes pass through one line.
The Pliicker coordinates of a line 1 in E are linear functions of those in S. 
This enables us to make some remarks on quadruples of homologous lines 
satisfying certain conditions. For instance the quadruple may be parabolic, 
which means that its two transversals coincide. The analytic condition is the 
vanishing of a determinant of order four the elements of which are quadratic 
functions of the coordinates of the four lines. Hence the locus of the lines in E 
such that their homologous quadruple is parabolic is a complex of order eight. 
If four lines lie on a hyperboloid their coordinates satisfy three conditions. 
Hence the locus of lines in E such that their homologous quadruples are on a 
hyperboloid is a ruled surface.
In Chapter IV, Section 7 we saw that a homologous triad 1,, l2, I? defines a 
line congruence with central axis lc. This congruence is the locus of all lines at 
a given distance and angle with L. In this section we ask which homologous 
quadruples !„ i = 1,2,3,4, lie on one such congruence; i.e., which lines lb 
i = 1,2,3,4, may be displaced by screw displacements about a single line L in 
X We proceed as in Chapter IV, Section 7 except now we add an additional 
position, i.e, we require

a-fi)-/c = O j = 2,3,4
and
(8.2) 
(/;-/;)• /с + /с•«’/.) = 0 j = 2,3,4.
The result, after we analyze these equations, will be that all I (or I.) with these 
properties lie on a line congruence. Similarly all corresponding Ц lie on a 
corresponding congruence. Thus there are double infinites of quadruples L 
and axes lc for which 0i = 02 = 
= 04 and Di = D2 = Dy = D4. We will see
that these congruences are congruent with the (9,3) congruence of screw axes 
defined in Section 5, U lies on the screw axis congruence in X, and 1, on the 
image screw axis congruence in E(.

Since we can write each term as a linear homogeneous function of the 
coordinates in E of / (or one of the I), (8.3) represents a cubic cone the 
generators of which give the direction for I (or h). The corresponding 
directions fc then follow from (8.1). Alternatively we can write the condition 
that the rank of (8.1), as an equation for / (or I), be 2, and show that the 
directions lc are also parallel to the generators of a cubic cone. Clearly, there is 
a (1,1) reciprocal correspondence between the generators of the two cones.
From (8.2) and Гс • lc = 0 we have four equations for the condition that 
the rank of this system should be three gives a linear equation in Г (or / *)•  This 
together with Г • I = 0 (or Г, • I, =0) yields a single infinity of values for /' (or 
Г,) for each pair of directions /, t. For any one of these /' (or /;) vectors, the 
corresponding Ге follows from (8.2). Alternatively we could proceed in an 
exactly analogous manner and find that there are an infinity of moment 
vectors l'e which satisfy (8.2) for every pair of directions /, /c. The conclusion is 
then, as we stated above, there are a double infinity of 1, L; 1 and lc belong 
respectively to line congruences fixed in E and
We will now show that the axes lc satisfy the condition given at the end of 
Section 2, and therefore Ic belong to the (9,3) screw axis congruence. We again 
introduce a complementary screw quadrilateral, say, sia, s25, sM, s4l> and 
consider first screws st2, S23. We know from Chapter IV, Section 7, that if nc is 
the normal between s(2 and L, n2 the normal between l2 and lc, n^ the normal 
between s» and L, see Fig. 27, then the angle from nc to n2 is «12/2 and the

distance from nc to n2 is Ciz/2. Similarly, the angle between n2 and ni is 
and the distance is си/2. Since nc, n2, all are normal to lc it follows that the 
angle between nc and nJ is a]2/2 + а2Ч/2 = аи/2 and the distance is 
Cii/2 + CzJ2 — CvJ2.
In an analogous way it follows that the angle between n'' and n? (respec­
tively, the normals between L and s4b and lf and sM) is - a4,/2 - aM/2 = an/2 
and the distance between them is - c41/2 - c^/2 = cl3/2, see Fig. 28.
Hence и must be located so that the normals to it from adjacent sides of the 
complementary screw quadrilateral are at equal angles and distance i.e., 
Z.ncnJ= Z.n^n7 and distance neni= distance n"n7. This is precisely the condi­
tion for a line to belong to the (9,3) screw congruence which we have already 
studied in some detail. Similarly, we can by inversion show that I, must belong 
to the image screw congruence. Hence all the properties which we developed 
for the screw congruences are directly applicable to the lh L congruences 
defined by equations (8.1) and (8.2).
As a special case of the foregoing we seek out those lines l4, i = 1,2,3,4, 
which are intersected orthogonally by a single line. Clearly 1< is the line that 
cuts the I, orthogonally; we require 0, = 02 = 0Э = 04 = tt/2, D, = D2 = D3 = 
D4 = 0. The solution can be obtained by using the equations developed in 
Chapter IV, Section 7 where we considered the same problem for three 
positions. If we set i = 1,2,3,4 in (7.6) and (7.8) of Chapter IV we find that 
there are, at most, six sets of homologous quadruples I, which have the sought

after property. This follows directly from the fact that in addition to (7.7) of 
Chapter IV we now have to satisfy a second cone-of-directions which is 
obtained by replacing the subscript 3 by 4 in (7.7) of Chapter IV. These two 
cubic cones intersect in at most 9 real lines, but three of these correspond to 
the screw axis directions and are spurious. Hence there are at most 6 possible 
directions. Now, equation (7.8) of Chapter IV yields an additional linear 
equation in Г. which can be obtained by replacing the subscript 3 by 4 in (7.9) 
of Chapter IV. The result is then that we have one moment vector /J for each 
one of the 6 directions I and hence at most 6 homologous quadruples with the 
desired property.
9, A special case of four positions
As an illustration of the preceding general theory we consider a special 
case. The six screw axes s(/ are in general skew lines; we suppose here that 
they are the edges of a tetrahedron B2 By (with faces £,) such that sI2 
coincides with ВУ B*  and so on (Fig. 29). It is easy to verify that the edges are a 
compatible sextuple for they satisfy the conditions derived in Section 5.

Indeed, the common perpendicular of s2b sM say, is the normal at B, on the 
face p3, and so on. The conclusion is that the six displacements are all pure 
rotations and the rotation angle is twice the dihedral angle between the 
two faces through the edge s,r
If Ai (i = 1,2,3,4) is a set of homologous points, A2 is the position taken by 
A, after a rotation about s(2 by angle d>l2. In other words, we can obtain A2 
from Ai by reflecting A, in Pi and then reflecting the resulting image, A*,
 
into p2. Hence any quadruple of homologous points consists of the reflections 
of an arbitrary point A * in the faces of the tetrahedron. A * will be called the 
fundamental (also sometimes cardinal, or base, or representative) point of A b 
A2, Aj, Ад. If A * lies in p. it coincides with A,; if A * is on the edge sv it 
coincides with A, and A, \ if A * coincides with Bx say, it coincides with A2, 
Aj, Ад.
A, and A2 are the reflections of A * into p> and p2 respectively. Hence A *,  
A,, A2 are in a plane U, perpendicular to s,2, intersecting pb p2 along lt, l2 and 
the edge st2 at O. (Fig. 30.) It follows that | OAj = | О A *|  = | OAJ; OAXA2 is 
an isosceles triangle with О as vertex. The perpendicular bisector of AXA2 in 
U coincides with the bisector OP of the angle AXOA2. Hence ZJ2OP = 
Z.A * О I,. (Here, I, is the perpendicular bisector of A,A *.)  The normal plane

of AjA2 passes through OP and s!2. The conclusion is: the normal plane of 
A ,A2 coincides with the plane we obtain if the plane through A * and s,2 is 
reflected into the bisector plane of the edge S|2. (The bisector plane of an edge 
contains the edge and bisects the dihedral angle between the faces which meet 
at the edge.) The angles of the normal plane of A ,A2 with the faces 0». 02 are 
the same as those of the plane A *s I2 with 02 and 0>.
The six normal planes of A,Aj pass through one point M, the circumcenter 
of the homologous points A, (i = 1,2,3,4). We have proved the theorem: if 
A * is an arbitrary point and if we reflect the plane A *s 0 into the bisector 
plane of st/ the six planes so constructed pass through one point M. We have 
established a correspondence between the fundamental point A * of a 
quadruple of homologous points and their circumcenter M. It is called the 
isogonal correspondence with respect to the tetrahedron. Obviously it is 
involulory: if M is conjugate to A *,  then A * is conjugate to M.
If A • lies in the face 0, it follows from the construction that M always 
coincides with B,. Conversely any point of 0, is conjugate to Bt. Hence the 
correspondence has singularities and it can not be linear. Its analytic form can 
easily be obtained: If x, is the distance of A * to the face 0„ it follows from 
Fig. 30 that the distances yB, y2 from any point on OP (to 0t and 02 
respectively) are related to the x, as follows: yi : y2 = x2: xf. Hence, since M 
is on OP, the distances of M to the faces are inversely proportional to those of 
A *.  If we introduce homogeneous coordinates, such that the coordinates of a 
point are proportional to its distances to the faces 0h the relationship between 
M(y4) and A *(x.)  is given by
(9.1) 
y, : y2: y3: y4 = x2x3x4: x3x4x, : x4x,x2 : xtx2x3,

Непсе there exists a cubic relationship between A*  and M\ as there is a 
linear relation between A * and Ax say, this is in accordance with the general 
results of Section 7.
The point M is in the plane at infinity if Sb,y4 = 0, where b, stands for the 
area of the face 0,. Therefore: the locus of the point A * such that the four 
homologous points A, are in one plane has the equation

H*  is Cayley’s cubic surface; it has double points at Bi and the six edges of 
the tetrahedron are on it. Any plane of points M corresponds, by the isogonal 
relationship, to a cubic surface of the same type.
Three homologous points, At, A2, A, say, are collinear only if they are on 
one of the edges through B4. Similarly, A * must lie on an edge if three of the 
A, are collinear, and the four cubic curves c, of Section 7 each degenerate into 
three concurrent lines, lying on H.
The four points A, lie on a circle if two A, coincide. Hence such a point Ak 
is on edge sw or s/k. Similarly A • must lie on an edge for this condition. The 
conclusion is that the sextic curve к in this case degenerates into the six lines 
which are the edges of the tetrahedron formed by reflecting tetrahedron Bb 
B2, B3, B4 into face pi. These lines all lie on H. Similarly, the edges of the 
original tetrahedron form the degenerate sextic к*  on H*  which is the locus of 
all fundamental points with corresponding A, (i = 1,2,3,4) on circles.
10. More than four positions
For n positions we have [n(n - l)]/2 screw axes and [n(n - l)(n - 2)]/6 
screw triangles. There are 6(n - 1) independent parameters associated with 
the description of these positions (relative to each other), and [4n(n - l)]/2 
parameters associated with the screw axes. It follows that the screw axes are 
not all independent (whenever n > 3). In fact, the axes require 2(n - 3)(n - 1) 
more parameters than do the positions, and therefore, in general, the number 
of independent axes is at most [n(n - l)]/2 - (2(n - 3)(n - l)]/4 = 
[3(n - l)]/2. When n is odd the number of independent axes is an integer; 
whilst for n even, the number is given by the quotient, and the remainder of 2 
implies that there are two additional free parameters. For n > 4 not all sets of 
3(n - l)/2 axes are independent. We illustrate these concepts with the case 
n = 5.
Example 10. Verify that the above is consistent with our results for three (л » 3) and four 
positions (n = 4).
For five positions we have ten screw axes but only six of these are 
independent. Furthermore, we know from the study of four positions that, in 
general, six arbitrary axes cannot belong to a set of four positions, and that 
there are at most four arbitrary axes for any set of four positions. It will be 
recalled (Section 1) that there are two different cases according to whether 
any three of the four axes belong to the same screw triangle.
If three axes belong to one screw triangle, the other three must also belong 
to one screw triangle, and the two triangles must have only one position in

common. All such sets of two triangles uniquely define the five positions. All 
ten screws follow by successive applications of the screw triangle geometry.
Example 11. Verify that the six axes of triangles st2, sn. Sj,, and su, sls, s45 are independent, 
whereas those of sl3, s(>, s» and s14, sis, Sj« or s„, sl4, s» are not.
Example 12. Verify that the ten axes can be obtained from the screw triangle geometry as 
follows: if we choose axes which form triangles s,a, in, s,, and sl4. s1Jt s,.  then dt, and 
follow from these triangles. Now considering position 1, /, k, these parameters and axes s(z, slh 
uniquely determine axes sA (/ « 2,3; к = 4,5; j/ k).
*
The second case occurs when no three of the six axes belong to one screw 
triangle: the only independent axes are members of two independent 
complementary-screw-quadrilaterals. Such screw quadrilaterals always have 
two screw axes in common. For example, axes sI2, sn, s^, s3s, $23 are 
independent and they form the two quadrilaterals sl2, sn, sM, s24 and sl2, s13, s35, 
s25 which have axes s12 and sn in common. We know that each of these 
complementary/ screw-quadrilaterals determines a (9,3) congruence (Section 
6). There is always a seventh screw axis (as yet undetermined) which is a 
member of both (9,3) congruences. (For the present example this axis is s23.)
This seventh axis follows from the intersection of the two congruences: we 
consider two sets of four positions (1, 2, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 3, 5 in this case). Then 
they each define one screw cone; the two (cubic) screw cones have 3x3 = 9 
generators in common. Parallel to each of these nine generators there is one 
plane of each congruence. Each pair of planes intersect in one line common to 
both congruences, and hence there are nine such lines
*
 (not necessarily all 
real). Two of these are Sj2, sn; any one of the remaining seven may be s23 
(there must always be at least one real line).
Once the seventh axis is known, two of the remaining axes (su and sl5t in 
this case) follow uniquely since each represents the sixth axis for one of the 
sets of four positions. Finally, the tenth axis (S45, in this case) is uniquely 
determined by any one of three screw triangles.
In general, these are the only possibilities for five positions. More than five 
positions can be analyzed similarly, the screw triangle and complementary - 
screw-quadrilateral are the basic building blocks in all cases.
We turn now to homologous points. For five positions, a point A of E has 
five positions AH A2, A3, A4, A5 in the fixed space J. From Section 7 it 
follows that the condition for coplanarity of A, (1,2,..., 5) requires that the 
5x4 matrix ||X, Y,Z, 11| has a rank of 3. Thus the coplanar points are those 
points with coordinates such that

provided not all the common 3x3 determinants of (10.1) and (10.2) vanish. 
Since (10.1) represents the cubic surface H, it follows that (10.2) also 
represents a cubic surface, say H5. Furthermore, we know that both surfaces 
must contain the twisted cubic c4, which is the locus of all points for which 
positions Ai, A2, A, are collinear. c4 is the locus of all points for which the 
common 3x3 determinants vanish. The result is then: points A with five 
coplanar positions are located on a sixth order curve, к1, which is the 
intersection of H and H5 excluding c4. The same analysis as used for к (Section 
7) shows that the genus of к’ is 3.
For six positions we have the additional condition \X,Y,Z, l| = 0 
(i = 1,2,3,6) which implies a third cubic surface H6 also containing c4. There 
are 10 points common to HA and к1 excluding those on c4. This follows from 
the formula I = n(Nt + N2 - 4)- (2p - 2), given by Semple and Roth [1949], 
in which / is the number of intersections of two nonsingular curves, with 
order and genus (n,p) and (n’,p‘), which form the complete intersection of 
two surfaces of orders Nt and N2- Here I = 3(3 + 3 - 4) - (2 0 - 2) = 8; of the 
18 intersections of H6 and к1 8 are on c4, and so 18 - 8 = 10 are the ones we 
seek. Hence the theorem: There are generally 10 points (not necessarily all 
real) in E with six homologous positions in one plane of S. Strictly speaking we 
must also add the plane at infinity to all the loci of coplanar points. Points at 
infinity remain in their plane for any number of positions, but there are 
generally no finite points with more than six positions on one plane.
Example 13. Show that there are generally no points with five homologous positions on one 
circle. Hint: two sixth order curves к (for positions 1.2,3,4) and say к, (for positions 1, 2, 3, 5) will 
generally not have any common points.
Equation (7.1) gives the condition that a point A of E has a constant 
distance in four positions from a fixed point M of J. We now determine the 
loci of points A for which this condition is valid for five, six and seven 
homologous positions. We can interpret this question as asking for those 
points in E which have five, six or seven homologous positions on a sphere (of 
radius IMA, |) in X.
For five positions we write (7.1) with j = 2,3,4,5. This means that M can 
exist only if the four equations are dependent. If we substitute A, = 
(Xh Y,t Zh W,) and M = (Mx, MY, Mz, Mw), then the required condition is the 
vanishing of the 4x4 determinant:

Each element is a linear homogeneous function of the coordinates of A, i.e., 
(x, y, z, w), and therefore (103) represents a fourth order surface, G$, 
embedded in E. Hence, the locus of all points with five homologous positions 
on a sphere is a fourth order surface. Similarly, the locus of corresponding 
centers M is a fourth order surface embedded in 2. This can easily be seen if 
we write (103) in terms of the coordinates of M rather than A, or by studying 
the inverse displacements. For six positions we have / = 2,3,4,5,6 in (7.1). 
Hence a unique M will exist only if the rank of the 5x4 matrix
(10.4) ||2(X/-X1),2(y/-yl),2(Z/-Z,),(A’-A?)|| /=2,3,4,5,6
is equal to 3. This condition is satisfied by those points with coordinates given 
both by (103), i.e., by G3, and by the 4x4 determinant obtained by using the 
subscript 6 instead of 5 in the last row of (103). This latter determinant yields 
Gft which is the fourth order surface containing all the points A with positions 
Ai, A2, Аз, A4, Aa on a sphere. The intersection of G? and G
*  gives the 
required locus provided we exclude those points for which the rank of the 
matrix (10.4), with у =2,3,4 is 2. In Section 7 we saw that a rank of 2 
corresponds to a sextic к (of genus 3) which is the locus of all points A with 
positions At, A2, A,, A4 on a circle. Since к is embedded in both G*  and G$, 
their intersection obviously contains it. Hence G6 and G5 intersect in к and a 
4x4-6= 10 order curve, k. The genus of k is eleven, this follows from 
2(p‘ - p) = (n1 - n)(Ni + N2-4) (see Section 7) if we set Nt = N2 = 4, n = 6, 
n1 = 10, p = 3. Our result is: the locus of all points A, in E, with six homologous 
positions on a sphere in 1 is a tenth order curve, of genus eleven, embedded in E. 
The corresponding centers M are located on an analogous curve, of order ten 
and genus eleven, embedded in 2.
For seven positions we have j = 2,3,4,5,6,7 in (10.4), and require that its 
rank is again 3. Hence we have to find those points on k which intersect G7, G-> 
being the determinant given by (10.3) with / = 7 instead of 5 in the last row. 
The result follows from the formula I = n(N, + N2 - 4) - (2p - 2) introduced 
earlier in this section. Here we have / = 6(4 4- 4 - 4) - (23 - 2) = 20. Hence of 
the 4 x 10 = 40 intersections of Gi and k, 20 lie on the intersections of k and к 
and must be discounted (since for points on к the rank of (10.4) with / = 2,3,4 
is 2), we have then 40- 20 = 20 points. The conclusion is there are generally 
twenty points (not necessarily all real) A, in E, such that their seven 
homologous positions A( (i = 1,...,7) lie on a sphere in 2.

originally obtained by Schoenflies [1886] using synthetic (as opposed to 
analytic) methods. Our treatment follows that given by Roth [1967b]. It is of 
course possible to obtain additional results for other loci, such as points with 
several positions on a cylinder or a helix, and to find analogous results for the 
instantaneous case as well as mixed finite and infinitesimally separated 
displacements., A general theory has been developed by Chen and Roth 
[1969a, b].
If we study planes in E we can obtain the results for five and six 
positions by extending our four position analysis. We have, for a plane 
U, with coordinates in 2 (uiM u3/, u4)) and passing through 
M(MX, MY.Mz, Mw), UifMx 4- u2lMY + a3/Mz 4- u<fMw =0 j = 1,2,3,4,5,6. 
The methods are exactly the same as for points. The results follow more 
immediately by inversion: the planes of E with five homologous positions 
passing through a point of 2 are such that the intersection point (of each 
homologous set of five planes) is on a sixth order space curve of genus three. 
This curve is the curve к’ for the inverse displacements. Similarly there are ten 
(not necessarily real) planes with their six homologous positions through a 
point of 2. These fixed points are the ten planar points of the inverse 
displacement. Of course the plane at infinity also satisfies these conditions.
The lines 1 in E which have four positions on the congruence defined by lb 
h, lj and the central axis L (see Chapter IV, Section 7) were shown to have 
their four positions on a (9,3) line congruence, Section 8. To study five 
positions we add another position to equation (8.1) and (8.2) i.e., we now have 
j = 2,3,4,5.
The analysis follows the same lines of reasoning we used for the points: the 
five position results are given by the intersection of the results of two four 
position problems if we disregard the singular elements. If we consider 
j = 2,3,4 and then j = 2,3,5 in (8.1) and (8.2), the conclusion is that the lines 
we seek are the intersections of two four-position (9,3) image-screw- 
congruences. They intersect in nine lines but three are singular: su, sI3, sjj. 
Hence, there are at most six lines I, in E, with five homologous positions at a 
constant distance and angle from a line lc in 2. Similarly if we seek the lines lc, 
we intersect two (9,3) screw congruences and, discounting the singular 
elements (in this case st2, sl3, S23), obtain: there are at most six lines lc in 1 which 
are central axes for five positions of E. A detailed treatment of this problem has 
been given by Roth [1967а]. The instantaneous case yields approximately the 
same result: the singular element is always the screw axis counted three times 
(see Chen and Roth [1969b]). There are generally no lines with more than five 
positions on a l,lc congruence. In all this lines at infinity are not counted.

11. The instantaneous case
We have already mentioned some results which apply when the positions 
are considered to be infinitesimally separated. Here we expand our discus­
sion. For m infinitesimally separated positions we are dealing with instantane­
ous kinematics up to order (tn - 1). The basic formulas come from Chapter II, 
(4.5). For the canonical system in the case of geometrical instantaneous 
kinematics we have from (6.3) of Chapter II:
Xo == X, X| = - y. X2 ~ - X 4- £Z,
X3 = (1 + e2)y + yYz 4- dy„

Zq — z, Zi — <7o»
+ (}£ “ yx )Z +
Z2 = - ex + Л, Zy = - yYx + (k 4 yx)y 4- dix.
These results enable us to explicitly develop all instantaneous geometric 
properties up to the third order. Following the development given in Chapter 
II, fourth, fifth and higher order formulas could easily be obtained. However, 
as we get five new geometric invariants with each increase in order, we limit 
ourselves here to explicit formulas for the third order properties. Higher 
order properties will be given implicitly.

the plane at infinity also satisfies this condition.

Obviously the inflection curve c ((14.3) of Chapter IV) lies on the cubic 
surface H. In general, no finite pointscan have undulations in their paths; and 
so no finite points of H have all four positions on a line. However, there are 
six points at infinity which are at undulations of their paths (as will be shown 
in Chapter VII, Section 4 and Chapter XII, Section 4).
Example 19. Show that the inflection curve c may be obtained from
if we exclude the line Z, - Z3 « 0.
Example 20. Show that an undulation point would require in addition to the conditions of

(excluding Z, « Z, = 0). and that this is generally impossible for a finite point.
Four infinitesimally separated positions of a point in E determine the 
sphere in X, called the osculating sphere, on which they lie. If 
M(MXy MY, Mz, Mw) are the homogeneous coordinates of the center point of 
the osculating sphere of the point A(x, y, z, w), it is necessary that these 
coordinates satisfy:
(11.3) (X - (MxIMW )Y + (Y- (MY/Mw ))’ 4- (Z - (Mz/Mw ))2 = R2
where R is the radius of the sphere. If we take the first three derivatives of 
(11.3) and evaluate them at the zero position we obtain
MxX, + MyY> + MzZi - Mw (XoX, 4- Yo Y, 4- ZoZ.) = 0
MxX2 +MyY2 + MzZ2 - Mw [(XoX2 + Yo Y2 + ZoZ2)

the second, the ones for the first and second from the equation for the third position, and the first 
three from the fourth.
If we substitute (11.1) we obtain from (11.4):

*
The equations are linear in Mx, MY, Mz, Mw and x, y, z, w and define a 
reciprocal cubic correspondence between them. The results are similar to the 
finite displacement case (7.2). That is:
(11.6) 
Mx : MY : Mz : Mw = Gx : GY : Gz : H
where Gx, GY, Gz, H are each cubic polynomials of x, y, z, w formed from 
the 3x3 determinants of the coefficients of (11.5). With these new definitions 
it immediately follows that the results of Section 7 are also valid for the 
infinitesimal case. Most important is the result that the locus of all points with 
four positions on a circle is the sextic к which is the common intersection of 
H = 0, Gx = 0, Gy = 0, Gz = 0.
Example 22. Modify the arguments used in Section 7 for the present case and verify that к does 
indeed have the same order in this limit case.
Example 23. Investigate the behavior of к at infinity.

which, if we substitute from (11.1) and Example 14, yields a cubic surface. 
This is the limit case of the surface we have called H5 (Section 10). The 
surfaces H and H5 intersect in c and a sixth order curve which is the limit of к1. 
Thus, all points with five infinitesimally separated positions on a plane is a curve 
к' embedded in E.
Example 24. Show that there are generally no finite points with five infinitesimally separated 
positions on a circle.

we obtain the surface corresponding to H6 in Section 10. The result is: there

There are in general no points with seven positions on a plane.
Example 25. 
Modify the arguments of Section 10 for the present case.
The points which remain on their osculating sphere for a fifth position 
satisfy (11.4) and also
MxX4 4- MyY4 4- MzZ4 - Mw[(XoX4 4- У0У4 4- Z0Z4) 4- 3(X? 4- У14- zl)
+ 4(X,X, + Y, Y, + Z,Z,)] - 0.
If we form the determinant of the coefficients of Mx, MYy MZy Mw in (11.4) 
and (11.9), and substitute (11.1) and Example 14 we have a fourth degree 
polynomial in x, y, z, w. This is the equation of the fourth order surface which 
is the limit of Gs introduced in Section 10.
For six positions we have in addition to (11.4) and (11.9):
MxX5 + MyY5 + MzZ5-Mw[(XoXs+ Y0Y5 + ZoZs)
(11.10) 
4- 10(X2X34- y2y3+ z2zj
4-5(XjX44- yJy44-ZIZ4)] = 0.
Using (11.4) and (11.10) we obtain a new fourth order surface which is 
analogous to G6 of Section 10.
For seven positions, (11.4) and
MxX6 +MyY6+ MzZ6- Mw(ХоХб4- УоУб + ZoZ6)
(11.11) 
4-6(X,X54- У, У,4-ZjZ5) 4-15(X2X4 4- y2y4 + Z2Z4)
4-io(x234- y’4-z?) = o
yield a fourth order surface analogous to G7 of Section 10.
Using reasoning analogous to that in Section 10, it is easy to show that the 
locus of the points with six positions on a sphere is a tenth order curve. For 
seven infinitesimal positions there are 20 points (not necessarily real) which 
have all seven positions on their osculating spheres.

Example 26. Verify that the finite position discussion of Section 10 applies to the infinitesimal 
case.
In general the finite position results are directly transferable to the 
infinitesimal position case. The major difference is that the several screw axes 
of the finite case tend to amalgamate and the screw axis for the first order (or 
the point on it at infinity) tends to become a multiple line (or point) in cases 
where the finite axes (or their points at infinity) are members of the given 
locus.
We complete this section with one further example.
In Chapter IV, Section 7 and in Section 8 of this chapter we treated the line 
congruence defined by three positions of a moving line being at a fixed angle 
and distance from a central axis L. For the infinitesimal case we have for the 
directions the equivalent of (8.1):
Li/< =0,
L2 • l( = 0,
Lj-t =0.
Here 4 is the direction vector of L and Lt (Lh M„ NJ is the i th derivative of 
the direction of the moving line as measured in X. Hence, the moving line 
must satisfy
L, M< N,

for four infinitesimally separated positions. Here a moving line with directions 
/, m, n in E has its geometric derivatives given by (using (11.1)):

Li = — m,
l2 = - 1 + en.

Hence, (11.12) is a cubic cone with the screw axis (i.e., / = m = 0, n = 1) as 
a double line.

Ml, = m
where L4, M4, N4 can be easily obtained from Example 14. (11.14) is a cubic 
cone; it passes through the screw axis and its tangent plane at the screw 
coincides with one of those of (11.12). Hence, (11.12) and (11.14) have the 
screw axis as a triple intersection, they also have six other generally distinct 
lines of intersection. These six lines give the directions for the moving lines 
which in five infinitesimally separated positions remain at a constant angle 
from some fixed line.
For the location condition we use equations analogous to (8.2):
(11.15) 
LM + f>L2 = 0,
and for a fifth position we add
(11.16) 
ИЧ 4-/?L4 = 0
where t'c and L\ are the moment vectors of respectively L and the ith order 
representations of the moving line. The components of L\ are obtained from
(11.1) and (11.13) using L' = X * L and Г = x x /, where X and x are position
vectors in S and E respectively. For any line with direction and moment 
components in E given by (Z,m, n), (/', m', n’) we have:

M{ = aol 4- Г, 
Mi = - m'- 2aom 4- Л/,...,

(As will be seen in Chapter VI, (8.1), this is the same as describing a line in 
terms of Pliicker coordinates p41, p42, p43, pz», ри, p«.)
With these equations we can now solve for the locations of the moving 
lines. We do not repeat the details since the arguments and results given in 
connection with (8.2) and at the end of Section 10 are applicable to this case 
also.
Detailed discussion of the theory and equations presented in this section, 
together with many other examples can be found in Chen and Roth

CHAPTER VI
CONTINUOUS KINEMATICS
1. Displacements in three-dimensional space
In Chapters III—V we have dealt with a finite number of positions of a space 
E with respect to a fixed space 2. We consider now a continuous series of 
positions of E with respect to 2. If the position of E depends on m 
parameters we shall say that E has a motion with m degrees of freedom. The 
most important case is m = 1, i.e., motions with (only) one parameter, say r. 
We must distinguish between geometric, i.e. time-independent, motions (in 
which case we are only interested in those properties which are invariant 
under transformations of the parameter) and time-dependent motions, in 
which case т stands for the time t.
In order to describe a motion we will make use of the analytic apparatus 
developed in Chapter I, restricting ourselves to the case n = 3: kinematics in 
three-dimensional space. We first reconsider the case of finite displacements, 
this time developed in such a way as to lead naturally to continuous 
displacements (i.e., motions): If P and p are the position vectors of a point P, 
in X and E respectively, we have (Chapter I, eq. (8.2)) 
(1.1)
P = Ap + <f.
A being an orthogonal matrix and d the displacement vector of the origin of 
E. In Chapter I (eq. (5.7)) we have shown that A can always be expressed 
as
(1.2) 
A = (I-B)”(I + B),
В being a skew matrix. We apply this general theorem to the case n = 3. The 
skew matrix В is then

fact that this equation must be reciprocal (Chapter I. Section 3).

factored as follows
(A - l){A2 + 2((62-l)/(62 + 1))A + l} = 0,
and so its three roots A(), A,,A2 are:
A<,= 1
(1.6) 
Ai.2 = (1 - b2±2ib)/(l + b2) = cos</> ±isin</>
(provided ф = 2 arctan (6)).
The three roots correspond to the three lines through О which are 
invariant under the rotation; the real root Ao corresponds to the rotation axis 
I, the complex roots Au to the isotropic lines in the plane perpendicular to I. 
As the eigenvector corresponding to Xo turns out to be (bb 62
*
 by), in view of 
Chapter I, Section 3 we have: the direction of the rotation axis of (1.4) is 
(bi.bi.bt) and the rotation angle ф satisfies tan|</> = 6. This gives us a 
geometrical interpretation of the parameters b..
Example 3. Show that the inverse rotation of (1.4) has the parameters - b,.
The general displacement (1.1) depends on the three parameters bt of A 
and the components d, of d. This implies that the unrestricted motion of E 
has six degrees of freedom.
We shall now determine the screw axis s of (1.1). Since the screw axis is 
parallel to the rotation axis of A, if x is the position vector of a point on s its 
displaced position X is given by X = x + /хб, д being a constant scalar. For a 
point on s equation (1.1) yields
(1.7) 
(X-l)x = цЬ-d,
which is equivalent to three (linear) scalar equations for the coordinates xt of 
x. But (A-I) is a singular matrix and the equations have therefore 
solutions. As (A - l)b = 0 is a condition for which the equations are depen­
dent, the components of the right-hand side of (1.7) in the direction of b must 
vanish. This is only the case if pb2- b • d = 0, or p. = (b ■ d)/b2, which implies 
that the translation component of the screw motion is given by ((b • d)/b2)b; 
hence its length is equal to the component of d in the direction b. Of the three 
equations only two are independent. The first and the second are

which are the equations of two planes, the intersection of which is the screw 
axis; they enable us to compute its Pliicker coordinates and therefore the 
Pliicker vectors S and S' of s. After some algebra (including use of the 
condition fib2 = b • d} we obtain
(1.9)
5 = 2b, S' = b x d - d 4- fib.
which together with the rotation angle ф. defined by tan ф/2 = b, and the 
translation distance (b-d)/b gives a complete description of the screw

Example 5. Discuss (1.9) (or the case b = 0 and for A - 0.
2. Study's soma
The matrix (1.4) obtains a more elegant form if we let b, » cjc9\ co/0:
(2.1) A.A =
co+c?-c2-c> 2(С|С2“СОСз) 2(с,сз + coc2) 
2(CZC| + C0C3) ci~ d + c22- d 2(с2Сз -CoCt) 
2(CjC| - CoCj) 2(c3Cj + CoCi) ci - c2 - C22 + c?
where A( = ci + c? + c2 + c*.
Thus we have A as a homogeneous function of four parameters c0, cb c2, c3. 
For (1.6) we obtain Au = [2cJ- Ai ± 2c0(ci- Ai),n]/A|. Formula (1.4) is only 
valid if no characteristic root is equal to - 1. As we remarked (Chapter I, 
Section 5) an expression for A in this case was obtained by Cayley by means of 
a limit procedure. We see that Au - - 1 if c0 = 0, which has been excluded so 
far. Therefore we can also accept the possibility for c0 to equal the number 
zero (which means that b, tend to infinity, their ratios being constant). The 
conclusion is that (2.1) is a representation of an orthogonal matrix in all cases, 
provided that the c< are not all zero. We can normalize the parameters such 
that A,= 1,in which case we have that c0 = cos ф/2; for c0 = 0 the rotation is a 
half turn. For c0= 1» Ci = c2 = Cj = 0 we have the unity transformation I; the 
inverse rotation of (c0, cIt c2, c>) is (- c0, Ci, c2, c3). The numbers c, are called 
the Euler parameters of the rotation. They are also useful in the representa­
tion of a displacement by means of quaternions, a subject to be treated in 
Chapter XIII.
The general displacement of E, given by (1.1), depends on six parameters; 
in other words, the “geometry”, for which a position of E is an element, is

six-dimensional. Such a position was called by Study [1903] a soma. As 
coordinates of a soma we could make use of the six numbers d. but then we 
exclude the half turns. This exception disappears if we apply the four 
homogeneous parameters c. and the three non-homogeneous dh but this is of 
course not a very attractive method. Study therefore introduced in soma 
space instead of d, four homogeneous numbers g, (i =0,1,2,3) defined as 
follows
diCi + d2c2 + die
*,
- diC0 + djC2- d2Cy,
- d2c0- dycx + dtc3,
” dyCo 4  d2C\ ~~ d\C2 ,
*
and we represent a position of E by the eight homogeneous coordinates 
(c0, Cj, c2,c3; g(bgi, g2, gj). From (2.2) it follows that they are not independent; 
indeed one has the fundamental relation
(2.3) 
cogo + C)g, + c2g2 + c,g3 = 0.
11 (Chgt) are given satisfying (2.3) the position is uniquely determined: the 
rotational part of the displacement depends on the ct only, and the d, follow 
from (2.2) as:
Aldi = goC, - g,Co + g2c3 - gjCj,
(2.4) 
Д ,d2 = goc2 - g2c0 + g3ct - giCj,
Aid3 = goC3 “ g3Co + g.c2 - g2Ci,
(which is easy to check by direct substitution).
There exists an analogy between the soma coordinates (c.; gt) (i = 0,1,2,3) 
and the Pliicker coordinates (q(,qi) (i = 1,2,3) of a line in three-dimensional 
space. As a counterpart of the Pliicker vectors (q;q‘) of a line we could 
introduce two “Study vectors'
*
 (in four-dimensional space) c and g with 
components c< and gt respectively. The fundamental relations have the same 
form: q -q' and c *g  =0. We must be aware, however, that the four 
numbers ct can not all be zero. In the corresponding case qt = q2 - q*  = 0 we 
have a line in the plane at infinity. Study has introduced singular (or 
improper) somas to make the analogy complete.
We now derive some implications of the representation of a displacement 
by the pair of vectors (c; g). The formula (1.1) gives the identity displacement 
if A = I, d = 0; hence its coordinates are: c0= 1, c< = 0 (i = 1,2,3), g, = 0 
(i = 1,2,3,4).

(CH. 6.12
If the displacement is a translation we have A = 1, that is cx = c2 = c3 = 0, 
from which it follows, by virtue of (2.2), that g0 = 0 and from (2.4) (if c0 = 1) 
that the translation vector reads d = -(gbg2, gj).
If the displacement is a rotation it follows that vector d is orthogonal to the 
direction of the axis of rotation (ct,c2, c3). Hence, in view of (2.2), for a 
rotation go = 0.
The inverse displacement D of the displacement D given by (1.1) has the 
equation
(2.5) 
p=A-(P-d).
Keeping in mind that A ' = AT we obtain p = AP + d if we let
(2.6) 
A = AT, d = - ATd.
From (1.5) it follows that c0 = - c0, ct = ct (i = 1,2,3). Furthermore we find 
after some algebra, by means of (2.1) and (2.4):
A«di = - goc, + giCo + g2c3 - g3c2
(2.7) 
A.d2 = -goc2 + g2co + g.3ci-gic3
A,d3= “ goC3 + g3Cn+ g,c2- g2c,
and then, comparing with (2.4):
(2.8) 
go=-go, g,=g< (i = 1,2,3).
Hence the inverse displacement of (c0, ct,c2, c3; go, gi,gj,g3) reads 
(- Co, Ci, c2, c3; - go, gt, g2, gj), which may give an idea of the elegance of this 
concept.
Several other questions follow naturally: what is the screw axis and pitch of 
a displacement?; what are the Study vectors of the product of two displace­
ments?; and so on. It may be shown, however, that this new apparatus can 
more efficiently be handled by other algebraic means, viz. quaternions and 
dual numbers. We shall do so in Chapter XIII. One such result (given without 
proof) is: In general two displacements have no point in common
*,
 if they 
have there is a common line. The condition for the displacements (c ;g) and 
(c'\g') to have a common point (and line) is:
(2.9) 
c -g' + c'-g =0,

3. Eulerian angles
In Chapter I we have, by Cayley’s method, derived a general expression for 
an n x n-orthogonal matrix. In Section 1 we have applied this to n = 3 and 
obtained the formula (1.4) with three (or four homogeneous) parameters.
In Chapter III (eq. (12.12)) an equivalent form was derived in terms of the 
screw parameters. Another, more simple but less symmetric formula has been 
given by Euler in terms of three angles named after him. As shown in Fig. 31, 
two Cartesian frames OXYz and with the same origin are given. The 
plane Oxy and Oxy intersect in a directed line d (called the line of nodes). We 
denote the angle 6 between Oz and Oz, and the angle £ between Ox and d; 
let ф be the angle between d and Ож. The positive sense of each angle is

 0 is measured from Oz to O, with d as axis. 
£ from Ox to d about the Z axis, and ф from d to Од with O, as axis. If we 
take 0< £ < 7Г the system is uniquely defined.
The three angles 6, f, ф determine the position of Ожуг with respect to OXYZ- 
If we consider unit vectors along Ot,Oy, O, and calculate their components 
along Ox, Oy, Oz by elementary geometry, we obtain the transformation 
matrix which gives the coordinates X, Y, Z of any point as linear homogene­
ous functions of its coordinates x, y, z :

It may be worth mentioning that Euler [1770], more interested in numbers 
than in geometrical reasoning, derived his formula in a purely algebraic way: 
If A = ||alk||, in a formal way he set a33 = cos0; in view of а3| + ам = 
a?3 + aL = 1“ cos2 0, he continued by taking a3( « sin 0 sin a, a32 = sin 0 cos a,
= sin 0 sin p, and а2з = sin 0 cos p. To determine the elements Q 11, Q 12, ^21 
and a22 he made use of the property that each is equal to its minor, which 
furnishes four linear equations for the unknowns.
Example 6. Given the matrix (2.1) determine the Eulerian angles.
We have until now determined the angular position of a moving space in 
several ways. We have the numbers b, or g, or the screw parameters, or the 
Eulerian angles. All of these concepts seem complicated in contrast to the 
simple way the velocity distribution of E can be described by a single vector 
Л, with its three components Dx,Ov,Dz. In a natural way the question arises 
whether it is possible to obtain a given position of E from a zero position by 
rotating it successively about Ox, Oy and Oz with finite angles. Unfortunately 
this is not an acceptable method because whenever the axes are embedded in 
the fixed system the composition of two finite rotations is complicated and not 
even commutative. We shall prove that the introduction of three rotation 
angles ax, ay, az about Ox, OY,OZ such that ax = Ox, aY = Пу, az = Hz is 
fundamentally impossible. We make use of the Eulerian angles 0, £, ф. In OXYz
• We use the angle < instead of the more usual ф in order to avoid confusion with the screw 
rotation angle ф. For a discussion of alternative definitions of Euler angles see Goldstein [1950, 
pg 108).

the angular velocity 0 is represented by the vector (0cos£, 0sinf,O), £ by 
(0,0, £). Ф by (Ф sin 0 sin f, - ф sin в cosf, Ф cos 0), as follows from Fig. 31.
Hence the following relations between the differentials should hold (the 
parameter r being irrelevant):
dax = cos f d0 + sin 0 sin f d</r.
(3.2)
dav = sin £ d0

daz = 
d£ + cos 0 dt/r,
and the question is whether this sytem can be integrated so that ax, ay, az are 
determined as functions of 0, ф. From the third equation it follows that 
daz/d0 = 0, Ьах1Ьф - cos 0, but in view of д2аг/Ь0Ьф = d2аг!дфЪ0 this 
leads to a contradiction. Hence (3.2) is a non-integrable, or using the usual 
term for similar situations in dynamics: (3.2) represents a non-holonomic 
system. It is impossible from (3.2) to express ax, ay, az in terms of the 
Eulerian angles. The differentials Ox dr, fly dr, flz dr have been called 
non-holonomic velocity parameters (see for example Hamel [1912]). Dividing 
(3.2) by dr gives the components of the angular velocity vector in the Oxyz 
system.
There is occasionally some confusion on this point, especially since (3.1) is 
often obtained by three successive rotations, but in this case the axes are O„ 
d, and Oz and not the fixed system Ox, Oy, Oz.

We will return to the question of determining suitable analytical descrip­
tions for the displacements in Chapter XIII where we will list additional 
methods. Of the methods developed in Sections 1-3, the results of Section 1 
will be used in Chapter X, and the others in Chapter XIII. It should, 
however, be pointed out that the Eulerian angles have to date had relatively 
little application in kinematics other than in areas associated with rigid body 
dynamics.
4. One-para met er-mot ions
A displacement of the space E with respect to 2 is given by
(4.1) 
P = Ap+d=T(p),
T being a linear, non-homogeneous function, containing six independent 
parameters. If these are functions of m variables (m = 1,2,...5) E has a 
motion with m degrees of freedom. For the time being we restrict ouselves to 
the case m = 1; cases m > 1 are considered in Chapter X. The variable will be 
denoted by t; differentiation with respect to r will be represented by a dot.
If we make use of Section 1 any motion of E can be described by giving the 
six parameters b„ d, as functions of r; the same holds for Section 2 if the Study 
vectors (satisfying c g = 0) are known as functions of t. The six functions 
contain the complete information about the motion and in principle they give 
sufficient information to enable one to answer any question concerning the 
motion. So, for instance, if we fix t, (4.1) gives the position of any point of E 
at that moment. If we choose p we obtain, with т as parameter, the path of P; 
if moreover p varies we get the set of paths. In a similar way we may study 
the ruled surface generated by a line of E (and the system of <»4 surfaces 
generated by the set of all lines), the system of »' planes (the developable or 
torse) which is the locus of the positions of a plane of E during the motion, or, 
to give another example, the (cyclic) surface generated by a circle of E.
It must be said that general theorems for these kinds of “global” problems 
or “problems in the large” are almost nonexistent, probably because they are 
either trivial or too complicated. Anyhow, theoretical kinematics did not 
develop in this direction, but restricted itself mainly to two features of the 
general properties of a motion. In one of them, one does not deal with six 
arbitrary functions, but one considers a specified motion (or a class of such 
motions), defined either analytically or, more often, geometrically. All studies

of this type deal with examples of special motions, which for some reason are 
interesting, usually because of their technical applicability. They will be 
treated in Chapter IX, on special motions.
The other line of research has a different view point. If the motion is given 
we know the loci generated by a geometrical element of E such as a point, a 
line, a curve, and a plane. Moreover, we know the differential-geometrical 
properties of these loci. So for example, for the path of a point we know its 
tangents, osculating planes, its curvature, and its torsion. It will be seen that 
there exist general theorems of these local characteristics (covariant configu­
rations and associated numbers), which as a rule state certain relationships 
between local properties of the whole set of moving points for a fixed value of 
t. These theorems deal with instantaneous kinematics and their study, which 
will be the contents of the next sections, therefore makes use of the 
developments given in Chapter II.
5. The axodes
In Chapter II we have derived the following concepts for instantaneous 
kinematics. The angular velocity (Chapter II, (3.6)):
(5.1) 
ft = AA‘;
the pitch (Chapter II, (4.11)):
(5.2) 
<r = (fl-d)ft'2;
and the Pliicker vectors of the instantaneous screw axis (Chapter II, (4.16)):
(5.3) 
(? = П, (?' = d - П x d - аП
In order to express these quantities in terms of the parameters introduced in 
this chapter we take A as given by (1.4), calculate A, and keeping in mind that 
A"1 = AT we obtain, after some algebra,

Furthermore from (5.2) it follows
(5-6) 
a = i Д((Ь X ь + b) • d)l(b!b2 - (b • b)1).
and from (5.3)
Q = 2Д ‘(ЬхЬ + Ь),

(?' = <f-2A '(bxbO)xd
- ((b x b + b) • d(b x b + b))l(b2b2 - (b • b)2).
These formulas could also have been derived from (1.9) by a limit procedure.
If we transform the parameter by substituting т = /(ti), all first derivatives 
are (at the same instant) multiplied by the same factor. From this it follows 
that the scalar and the screw axis s are geometrical invariants of the motion 
(while Q is not). If т varies, ct(t) is a variable function during the motion, and 
s(t) represents a ruled surface S' in the fixed space 2. which will be called the 
(fixed) axode of the motion. As a counterpart there exists a “moving” axode 
which is the locus, S, of s considered as a line in the moving space E. The fixed 
axode of the continuous motion (b(r), <f(r)) is given by (5.7), which expresses 
the Pliicker coordinates of its generators as functions of the parameter t. A 
similar representation of the moving axode may be found by considering the 
inverse motion.
<t(t) and s(t) are instantaneous invariants of the first order. At any instant 
the velocity of a moving point is the same as that of a screw motion about s. 
with angular velocity D and translation component <rD.
At any instant the moving axode S has the generator s in common with S'. 
To further investigate the relative position of S with respect to S', instantane­
ously, we need instantaneous invariants of higher order, as developed in 
Chapter II, Section 6. As we are restricting ourselves here to local properties, 
we make use of the special coordinate system introduced in Chapter II, 
Section 5 to study the geometric properties of the canonical system. For r = 0, 
the position under consideration, the two Cartesian frames coincide, hence 
b = 0 and d = 0, Д = 1. It follows from (5.5) that = 2b. Furthermore, from 
(5.5) and in view of Д = 2b - b
= 2Д’2{Д(Ь x b + b) - 2(b x b + b)(b ■ b)},
and therefore (since b = 0 and Д = 1)

Differentiating fl and putting r = 0 we obtain
(5.9) 
П2 = 2(b + b x b - 2b2b).
Comparing all this with (5.8) of Chapter II we have
(5.10) 
co = 2b, e = 2b, у = 2(b - 6b2b),
so that the instantaneous invariants co, e, у are determined as functions of the 
motion parameters b,. If we substitute = 2b into = <ТпЛ>, and also (5.8) 
and (5.9) into (5.1) of Chapter II, we find the pitch rr(, and the Pliicker vectors 
(QQ ) of the screw axis s (and their derivatives) as functions of the 
parameters (b„ d,), of the motion, and their derivatives.
All these formulas simplify considerably if we normalize the parameter and 
make use of the canonical coordinate frame introduced in Chapter II, 
Section 6.
Example 11. Show that at т = 0 a canonical frame yields b = 0, rf = 0. b = (0,0, |), <f я (0.0. <rM). 
> = (0,k.0). d = (0, де. A).
Only the first order instantaneous properties of a motion are represented 
by the screw axis and the pitch <r<». It follows from this that first order 
geometrical properties of the axodes depend on the invariants of the motion 
up to the second order, that is (using the nomenclature of Chapter II, Section 
6) on an, e, А, д, and that, in general, m-th order properties of S' and S are 
functions of the motion invariants up to the (tn + 1 )-th order. The first order 
properties of s, taken as a generator of the axode S', are the tangent plane of 
S' at each point of s and the point on s which is (in the limit) the foot of the 
common perpendicular between s and its neighboring generator on S'; in the 
geometry of ruled surface this latter point is called the striction point of s, we 
have taken it as the origin О of our canonic frame.
Now we have seen in Chapter II, Section 5 that the second order invariants 
of a motion are essentially the same as those of the inverse motion (the 
difference in sign arises from the different orientation of the respective 
canonic frames). This implies that first order properties of s taken as either a 
generator of S' or of S are identical, which means that the common generator 
s has the same striction point on S' and S, and moreover that the tangent 
planes to S' and to S, at any point on s, coincide. The axodes S' and S are 
tangent to one another at every point of their common generator. The 
situation where two ruled surfaces are so related with respect to one another 
is expressed by saying that they are raccording along s.
It follows from Chapter II, Sections 5 and 6 that the Pliicker vectors, up to 
the first order, of the screw axis are

Q = {0,ет,1},

hence its direction is {0, гт, 1} and its intersection with the plane Oxv reads 
{рзьРм»0,рм} or {(<rn- д )ет,0,0}. Therefore if we characterize a point on s 
by its distance и along s to the plane Oxx, the axodes S' and S (in the first 
order neighborhood of s in terms of the parameters т and u) are represented 
by
(5.12) 
Ха(ао-д)гт, Y = etu, Z = u, W = 1.
Hence, up to this order they coincide with the hyperbolic paraboloid
(5.13) 
(сто-M)YW-XZ = 0,
their raccording quadric. The invariant 6 = (д - <rn) which appears in this 
equation is a well-known quantity in the theory of ruled surfaces. It follows 
immediately from (5.11) that it is the limit of the ratio of the distance and 
angle between two consecutive generators; it is denoted by the (not very 
fortunately chosen) term: distribution parameter (German: Drall). Obviously 
the common generator has the same 8 on S' and S.
The tangent plane to (5.13), and therefore to S' and S, at the point 
(0,0, z0,1) has the equation
(5.14) 
SY + zoX=0;
hence 8 determines the relationship between a point on s and the correspond­
ing tangent plane through s; this could be taken as a definition of the number 
8. The tangent plane of the axodes al the striction point (z<> = 0) is Y = 0: the 
common asymptotic tangent plane is X = 0. This gives us a new interpretation 
of the canonical frame. Il is a well known property of any ruled surface that 
the tangent plane at the striction point is orthogonal to the asymptotic tangent 
plane. This may be used to define the striction point as that point along the 
ruling at which the tangent plane is orthogonal to the asymptotic tangent 
plane for the same ruling.
Example 12. Show that the raccording quadric (5.13) is an orthogonal hyperbolic paraboloid. 
Example 13. Show that the normal to S' and S at the striction point coincides with the axis OY of 
the canonical frame.
Summing up, the position of S with respect to S' is such that they have a 
common generator s, the striction points of each surface on s coincide at O, 
their tangent planes at О coincide. This determines the position of S and 
therefore of E with respect to X. Since the 6’s of s are the same on both 
surfaces the axodes are in raccordance in view of (5.14).
This situation yields, at any instant, the following geometric description for

the motion of E with respect to S: In the spaces E and J the ruled surfaces S 
and S', respectively, have a (1,1) correspondence between their generators s 
and s'. The surfaces are not arbitrary: for two corresponding generators the 
number S must be the same. The motion of E is generated by the following 
motion of S: at any instant a pair of corresponding generators coincide and 
the two surfaces are in raccordance along this common line (which determines 
the position of E completely). The motion is built up of a series of 
infinitesimal screw displacements with successive common generators as axes. 
This yields a special combination of rolling and sliding of the two ruled 
surfaces, which is called “schroten” in German (Dutch: schrooien; French: 
virer, viration), whereby at any instant the rolling and sliding are taking place 
about a common axis. The locus of the striction points on successive 
generators of S' is called its striction curve k'; in the same way we have a 
striction curve к on S. Obviously at any instant the curves k' and к intersect at 
the instantaneous striction point. The curves к and k' depend on the second 
order instantaneous invariants of the motion (<то, e, Л, д). Hence their first 
order differential-geometric properties, such as their tangents and their 
arc-elements, depend on the third order invariants, that is on the set 
(сто, e. Л, д, yx, yY, dy„ dy„ dyz ), introduced in Chapter II, Section 6. We know 
that these are in general not the same as for the inverse motion. A 
consequence is that, for instance, к and k' are in general not tangent at their 
common point.
The representation of a motion by successive infinitesimal screw displace­
ments of surfaces is theoretically interesting, but in the general case does not 
seem to lead to easily manipulatable results. Some examples of axodes will be 
given in Chapter IX: in the main, however, applications are restricted to such 
special cases as spherical and planar kinematics (Chapters VII and VIII). The 
relationships between the local properties of the axodes (and their striction 
curves) and the higher order instantaneous invariants do not seem to have 
been developed.
There are of course many special cases. An important one appears when 
cr0 = 0: the instantaneous motion is then a rotation which means (using an 
equivalent terminology) the motion is, at the instant, tangent to a rotation. If, 
moreover, « 0, which implies Л = 0, the motion osculates a rotation. It is 
possible that during a continuous motion cr is permanently zero; this special 
motion will be treated in Chapter IX. Another special case is 6 = д - a0 = 0; 
this implies that, in view of (5.14), all tangent planes along s coincide with the 
plane X = 0, which means that S' (and S) are locally developable. If 6 = 0 for 
every generator, the axodes S' and S are both developable surfaces and their

cuspidal curves (the tangents of which are the generators) coincide with the 
striction curves k' and k.
If at every instant the screw axis in X and the angular velocity О and the 
pitch a are given, the motion of E is implicitly determined if we know its 
initial position. It may in principle be found by a procedure of integration; a 
method for doing this was given by Darboux [1887]. He showed, however, 
that the analytical treatment leads to a differential equation of the Riccati 
type which implies that the solution cannot be given (except in special cases) 
by quadratures.
6. The point-paths
In this section we investigate the differential geometrical properties of the 
paths of the moving points. If, for the canonic frame, (x, y, z) and (X, Y, Z) 
are the coordinates, of a point, in E and 1 respectively, we have according to 
Chapter II, (6.3), up to the second order:
X = x,

which represents the same tetrahedral complex as in Chapter III, (11.1). If p4 
are the coordinates of a line of the complex of instantaneous tangents, i.e., if 
they satisfy (6.4), we may solve for the point (x, y, z, w) from (6.3) obtaining

Hence any line of the complex is in general the tangent of only one of its 
points. There exists a birational relationship between the points of E and 
their instantaneous tangents; (6.3) and (6.6) are both quadratic.
Example 14. This relationship has some singularities. Show from (6.3) that the only point for 
which the tangent is undetermined is (0.0,1.0), i.e., the point Z at infinity of the screw axis. Show 
that, although (6.5) and (6.6) are meaningless, in this case the point corresponding to a line at 
infinity 
- 0), which is always a line of the complex, is (— puPn.pupn.pn + Pzt.O);
if the line passes through Z(pu = 0) it corresponds to Z unless pf> + p»e0 when it is 
undetermined.
Any line of the complex (6.4) corresponds in general to one point on it. 
Through an arbitrary point Pn pass lines of the complex, they are the 
generators g of a quadratic cone. One of the generators, g« say, corresponds to 
Po itself. We now determine the locus of the points P corresponding to the 
generators g. An arbitrary plane through Po contains two generators, to each 
there corresponds a point; hence the plane contains three points of the locus, 
Po being one of them. The conclusion is: the locus of the points corresponding 
to the generators of a cone of the complex is a twisted cubic k3t passing 
through its vertex. This curve can more simply be defined as the locus of the 
points with path-tangents which all pass through a given point of 2.
Example 15. Show that g,, is the tangent of кл at P„.
Example 16. Show that the tangent plane of the cone (of the complex) through g,, is the osculating 
plane of кэ at Po.
Analogously we may ask for the locus of the points corresponding to the 
lines of the complex lying in a given plane A. These lines are the tangents of a 
conic к and as each of them has one corresponding point on it we may expect 
the locus to be a straight line. This is easily verified analytically. The locus 
consists of the points for which the point and the path-tangent (or, in other 
words: the velocity vector) lies in A; they satisfy the two linear equations 
A|X 4- Л2у + A3z + A4 = 0 and - Aiy + A2x 4- Лэа0 = 0. Hence the locus asked 
for is a line m, corresponding to the plane A; we shall meet it again in Section 
7. For the line-coordinates of m we obtain pi2=<r0At рм = -(Л? + Л2), 
p)4 = АЛэ, p2< = A2A5 and as they satisfy (6.4) the line m itself belongs to the 
complex and is therefore a tangent of the conic k. The tangent point is the 
corresponding point of m.
The normal plane at the point (x, y, z, w) of a path is normal to its tangent;

the latter has the direction X : Y : Z = - у : x : aQw. Hence the equation of

On the other hand it follows from (6.9) that

(6.11) U2X - U}y + (TaU}W - 0,
( - l/i - eUJx - u2y + sUtz + (peU2 + At/3)w = 0,
which implies that x, y, z, w are cubic functions of Uh and leads to the inverse 
expressions of (6.10). Hence a plane of 1 is in general the osculating plane to 
the path of one point of E. There exists a birational cubic relationship 
between the points of E and the planes of £; a point and its corresponding 
plane are incident.
We already know from Chapter IV that the relationship has singularities. If 
w = 0 the corresponding plane is (0,0,0,1); any point at infinity corresponds

to the plane al infinity, and so this plane corresponds to each of its points. 
More interesting is the case when (6.9) has rank two. Then three consecutive 
points of a path are collinear: the path has an inflection point. This occurs if 
the second and the third row of (6.9) are proportional, that is if
(6.12) -x + ez = -uv. - у + fjLtw = их, - ex -+• Aw = <r(luw,

и being a parameter.
Hence the locus of those points of E which are at an inflection point of their 
paths is a twisted cubic, the instantaneous inflection curve Cy. It is a parabolic 
cubic since it osculates the plane at infinity (at Z when the parameter takes on 
the value и = «). The directions of the inflection tangent in the fixed space is 
(for e / 0):
(6.14) 
X : Y : Z = - (a„u2 - Au + е2ц ): (- cr.iU + A): <rnE.
From (6.13) and (6.14) the Pliicker coordinates of an inflection tangent follow; 
they are fifth order functions of u. Hence the locus of the inflection tangents is 
a quintic ruled surface F$; all this is in accordance with the results in Chapter 
IV on three positions theory.
Example 17. Determine the tangent to c. at a general point and especially at Z.
Example 18. Determine the Pliicker coordinates of the generators of F«.
Example 19. Derive a representation of F< by means of two parameters и and v.
Example 20. Determine the intersection of F< and the plane at infinity.

with the tangent to сэ-
Example 22. Show that for » 0 the curve c, degenerates into a line and a conic; determine the 
plane of the latter. Investigate F< for this case.
The normals at a point of a path are first order covariants. Their locus, the 
linear complex L depends only on the first order invariant a0. Now that we 
have derived the osculating plane U we are able to study the two special 
normals: the principal normal, lying in U, and the binormal, orthogonal to U.
The principal normal n, is the intersection of the normal plane (6.7) and the 
osculating plane (6.10). Hence the Pliicker coordinates of ni are polynomials 
of degree four in the point coordinates (x, y, z, w).
The question arises whether an arbitrary normal is the principal normal for 
one or more of its points. A line pif is a normal if it satisfies (6.8), from which it 
follows in view of the fundamental relation that if 0 the normal n also 
satisfies

By definition, the direction of n is (pt4: p24 ■ pu) and its intersection with O
*y
 
is (рльРл2,0,pM). This implies that a point P on n has the coordinates 
(supposing pu/ 0),
(6.16) 
X = pM + rpl4, Y = pu+rp2^ Z = rp^ W = pM,
r being a parameter on n. The osculating plane of P follows by substitution of 
(6.16) into (6.10), keeping in mind that X = x, etc. The normal n and the plane 
U both pass through P Hence, n will be in U (which implies that n is the 
principal normal of P) if one more point different from P, is in U. For this 
point we lake (pt4, p24,pu,0) which obviously satisfies (6.16). The condition is 
then Uipu + U2P24 + U'P?u = 0, which is clearly a quadratic equation for r. The 
conclusion is: a normal is in general the principal normal of two of its points. 
(Sticher [ 1972], Bottema 11975b].)
A real point has a real principal normal, which implies that the roots of the 
quadratic equation are not always imaginary. On the other hand it is not sure 
that they are always real. One counter example is sufficient to disprove this.
Example 23. Consider the line x = y, z = k, which satisfies (6.8) and is therefore a normal. Show 
that the two points for which this line is the principal normal are imaginary if к > 
(A2 - 
*’)/2<t,,f 2.

and q2 denote quadratic functions of p„. If we calculate the discriminant of 
(6.17) it may be shown, after some algebra (using (6.15)), that this expression 
of degree six has p2u as a factor. Since p^ was supposed to be unequal to zero, 
those normals for which the two points coincide satisfy an equation of degree 
four, representing a quartic line complex. As the normals are lines of L the 
conclusion is: the locus of the principal normals to the paths is a subset of the 
linear complex L of all normals; to L belongs a (4,4) congruence which 
separates in L the lines which are principal normals from those which are not.
The normals in a given plane тг of J are the lines of a pencil with vertex Po, 
the null-point of тг with respect to the linear complex L. On any line p of the

pencil there are two points, real or imaginary, for which p is the principal 
normal. We now determine the locus c of these points. Pn belongs to the locus 
for its principal normal is a line, p(l say, of the pencil. On any line p, different 
from po, there are two points of c different from Pu. Hence the locus c is a 
curve of order three. Obviously p<> is the tangent of c at P„. A cubic curve has 
in general a class of six, which implies that the number of lines through P«, 
tangent to c at a point different from P(>, is four. These lines separate, in the 
pencil, those lines intersecting c in two real points from those intersecting c in 
two imaginary' points (different from P(l). They are the four lines of the (4,4) 
congruence, mentioned above, lying in it (and passing through Po).
Example 24. Let it be the plane Z » then P  (0,0, z„). Show that c is the circular cubic given 
by the equation (A - fxRx2 + y2) - tr„F(ztty + fj.x) = 0. Two of the lines, through P. of the (4.4) 
congruence are isotropic. Determine the other two and investigate whether they arc real or 
imaginary.
*
The binormal n2 at a point P of a path is perpendicular to the osculating 
plane. Hence its direction numbers are Ui'.U2:Uy given by (6.10) and 
therefore they are quadratic functions of the coordinates of P. It follows that 
the Pliicker coordinates of n2 are cubic functions of x, y, z and w.
Example 25. Show that n, is undetermined if P is on the inflection curve. Show that for a point P 
at infinity the binormal coincides with PZ, provided P is not on the pair of imaginary lines 
x’+y’® w =0. in this case n2 is undetermined.
We now investigate the inverse relationship between the point P and its 
binormal. Any normal pit satisfies (6.15) and a point P on it is given by (6.16). 
We shall try to determine the parameter r such that the normal is the 
binormal of P. or in other words that it is orthogonal to the osculating plane of 
P. We know that the line is orthogonal to a line of the plane (the tangent of 
the path). Hence we need only one condition more to ascertain that it is the 
binormal. It follows that the two conditions 17,: U2: Uy = p,4: p24: pu are 
dependent and we may restrict ourselves to р^СЛ - puU2 ~ 0. If we do so the 
quadratic term r2 vanishes and making use of (6.15) the equation reads
(6.19) 
(pJ4 + p«)r - Fp,3pM - Apt + pep24Pu + рмР14 + pMp24 = 0,
a linear equation for the parameter r. The conclusion is: a normal is in general 
the binormal of one of its points. (Bottema [1975b]), or in other words: the 
locus of the binormals is the (complete) linear complex L.
If we solve for r from (6.19) and substitute it in (6.16), then after some 
reduction by means of (6.15) we obtain

The coordinates of the point for which the normal p0 is the binormal are 
quadratic functions of p,r The relationship between a point and its binormal is 
birational.
Example 26. Verify that the point (6.20) is on the line p„.
The binormals in a given plane it of 2 are the lines of the pencil with vertex 
Pn, the null-point of it with respect to L. On any line lies one point P such that 
the line is the binormal of P. The locus of P, in plane tt, is seen to be a conic K, 
passing through Po; the binormal of Po itself is the tangent, at Po, to K. The 
points of К at infinity have normals passing through Po, which implies that 
these points are on the singular lines x2 + y2 = w = 0. Hence К is an ellipse.
Let 0? be an arbitrary plane of X, with the equation V,X + V2Y + V3Z + 
V4 W = 0. Its null-point Po is then (<rn V2, -

(6.21) 
pl4 = xVy- aowV2, p'24 = yV9 + (TewV,, p;4 = zV3 + wV4.
The condition pj4: p'24 - Ut: U2 which gave us (6.19) also gives us an equation 
for P. Substituting for U, from (6.10) and keeping in mind that P lies in this 
condition can be reduced to
V3(x2+ y2)+ (a0V. + ЛV2~ pEV3)yw + (AV, - <ToV24- eVJxw

which represents a paraboloid of revolution, passing through the singular

plane ®.
Example 27. Determine the conic К in a plane orthogonal to the screw axis.
Example 28. Determine the conic К in a plane parallel to the screw axis.
We have thus obtained the properties of the triad to the path of any point, 
of the moving space, at a certain instant. Summing up: the tangent, the 
principal normal, and the binormal have Plucker coordinates which are 
polynomials of the point coordinates of degree two, four, and three respec­
tively.

THE POINT PATHS

Example 29. Show that the direction numbers of the three lines are polynomials of degree one, 
three and two respectively. Write them out explicitly and check that they are mutually 
orthogonal.
In Chapter IV on three positions theory we introduced the circle axis, that 
is the axis of the circle through three homologous points. Its counterpart in 
instantaneous continuous kinematics is the curvature axis of the path of the 
moving point. The curvature axis is the line of intersection of two consecutive 
normal planes of the path. The normal plane at the point X, Y, Z of the curve 
X(t), Y(t), Z(t) has the coordinates
X, Y, Z, - (XX + YY + ZZ).
Hence the curvature axis is the intersection of this plane and the plane with 
the coordinates
X, Y, Z, - (X2 + Y2 + Z2) - (XX 4- YY 4- ZZ).
In the instantaneous case, making use of (6.1), the two planes (for the point 
(x,y,z) of E) have the coordinates:
- у, X, (To, - <T0Z,
(6.24)
- x + ezt - у 4- /ле, - ex 4- A, - a0-pey - Xz.
From this the Pliicker coordinates of the curvature axis follow:
pI4 = - ex2 4 Ax 4- <roy -

p3i = - pexy 4 (ToE/xZ - Axz - aoyz - aJx,
P12 = cr0( - (To - pey - exz).
It is orthogonal to the osculating plane (6.10). The Pliicker coordinates of the 
curvature axis are quadratic functions of the point coordinates. To every point 
of E there corresponds a curvature axis in £; hence at any instant the locus of 
these curvature axes is a complex of lines. Its equation would follow if we 
were able to eliminate (x, y, z) from (6.25). This seems too complicated, but 
we may at least determine the degree of the complex. A line of (6.25) is at 
infinity if pu = p?4 = рм = 0, this means that the osculating plane is not 
determined and we know that this is the case for the points on the inflection

curve. If we substitute their coordinates from (6.13) into pn, p)t, pi2 we obtain 
expressions of order six in the parameter u. Hence the complex curve in the 
plane at infinity is a (rational) curve of class six. The conclusion is that the 
complex is of the sixth degree.
Example 30. Show that for a point of the inflection curve the two planes (6.24) are parallel. 
Example 31. Show that the line at infinity of the plane X *=  0 is the curvature axis of the point at 
infinity of the screw axis Oz.
The center of curvature at a point of a path is the intersection of the 
curvature axis and the osculating plane. (It may be defined as the center of the 
circle through three consecutive points of the path.)
To determine the center of curvature M we note that the equation of the 
osculating plane may be written as
(6.26) 
pl4X + puY + pMZ +U.W = 0,
where ри,р24,рч are given by (6.25) and 1Л by (6.10). A point on the 
curvature axis is
(6.27) 
Х=р.м + ф|ъ V = p,2-ь rp24, Z = rpM, VV = pM,
where r is a parameter and pM / 0. For the intersection of (6.26) and (6.27) we 
obtain
r = (PhPij + P24P23 - р.м1/<)/(р?4 + P24 + Pm).
If we substitute this into (6.27) it is easy to see that (after some reduction by 
means of the fundamental relation for pv), all four coordinates have the factor 
p«. The result is that M is found to be
X = P21P24 + Рз«р.м ~ P^U^

7- 
rr
Z — P13P14 + P23P24 рм<Л,
VV =P?4+P24+Pm.
In view of (6.10) and (6.25) we obtain: the coordinates of the center of 
curvature are polynomials of degree five in the coordinates of the moving 
point.
If pu = P24 = p.M = 0, that is if we deal with an inflection point, the curvature 
center is undetermined. Indeed: any point at infinity in the normal plane is a 
center.
Example 32. Verify that (6.28) satisfies (6.26).

THE POINT-PATHS
171
Example 34. Determine (he center of curvature corresponding to a point on the screw axis and 
show that the locus of all such points is a twisted cubic.
From the symmetrical expressions (6.28) follows a rather simple formula for 
the distance from the origin to the center of curvature, |OM|. We have
x}+y' + z! = 2 (pllPu+p.,pu)2 + ui • S p N
= S Pt'S Р2'-(РнРг, + Р«Рч + РмР|2)2+ UJ-2 P
*
 
therefore, in view of the fundamental relation for pv, we obtain 
(6.29) 
(OM)2 = (pl, + p2„ 4- p?2 4- UO/(P?< + ph + ph),
p(, and U4 being given by (6.25) and (6.10) as functions of the coordinates of 
the point P of which M is the center of curvature.
A more difficult, and as yet (it seems) unsolved, problem is to determine the 
point P of the moving space if the center of curvature M in J is given, or in 
other words to derive the inverse relationship of (6.28). An example shows 
that this is not rational: in general M does not correspond to one point P. 
Take M at the origin О: X = Y = Z = 0. Then the corresponding point P 
must have its osculating plane and curvature axis both passing through O, 
hence \J4 = 0, p2, = p,( = pl2 - 0. Points satisfying the last three equations are 
for instance those of the line у = - a2Jp.e. z = 0. If we substitute this in 
LA = 0 we obtain a cubic equation for x. which means that there are at least 
three points P, real or imaginary, corresponding to M.
The radius of curvature p of the path could be found from (6.28) as the 
distance between P and M. The result follows more easily if we make use of 
the formula for p as it is derived in the differential geometry of space curves. 
The general equation for path curvature reads
p2 = (X? 4- Y? + Z?)34(X2Y, - X, Y2y
(630) 
+ ( y2z, - Y,Z2)2 + (Z2X, - Z,x2y],
so that we obtain
(6.31) 
p2 = (x2 4- у2 + atfHp?4 + p« 4- p m),
pl4 being given by (6.25). The numerator is a polynomial of degree six, the 
denominator one of degree four, in terms of the coordinates of the point in E. 
The radius cannot be zero unless a0 = 0, which is as expected because in 
general there is no point instantaneously at rest: in general no path has a cusp. 
The radius is infinite only if pI4 = p24 = pM = 0: the moving point is at an 
inflection of its path.

The principal normal, the binormal, and the curvature are second order 
properties of the path and of the motion; they depend on the four instantane­
ous invariants <r0, e, /л, Л. Third order properties such as the torsion and the 
osculating sphere (through four consecutive points of the path) depend on five 
more invariants, denoted in Chapter II, (6.3), as yx, yr, d3x, d3r, d3z. Although 
an apparatus to study these properties was completely developed in Chapter 
11, its general theory, involving nine constants, seems too complicated to 
insure reasonably concise results; even the second order theory, given in the 
preceding sections, was far from simple and left many open questions. This is 
the reason why we shall not continue these investigations in detail here. The 
general principles have already been developed and the results follow the 
comparable cases for finite displacements. To illustrate this we briefly 
consider the osculating sphere.
The osculating sphere of a space curve is the sphere through four 
consecutive points of the curve. Its center N is the intersection of three 
consecutive normal planes and is therefore a point on the curvature axis. If 
the curve is given by Х(т), У(т), Z(t) the normal plane at the point has the 
coordinates
X, У, Z, - (XX + УУ + ZZ), 
and those of the two consecutive normal planes are
X, У, z, - £ XX - £ X’, 
and
X, У. Z, - £ XX - 3 £ xx.
If we apply this to a path in the zero position, substituting the formulas from 
Chapter II, (6.3) it is easy to verify that the fourth coordinate of each of these 
three planes is a linear (and not a quadratic) function of x, y, z. The 
homogeneous coordinates of the sphere center N are the 3x3 determinants 
of the matrix

Hence coordinates of N are polynomials of degree three in the coordinates of 
the moving point. The locus of those points for which four consecutive 
positions are coplanar is a cubic surface; its equation is obtained by putting 
the first 3x3 determinant of (6.32) equal to zero. In the general case the 
radius of the osculating sphere is the distance |NP|.
7. The motion of a plane
In the preceding section we have studied the properties of the path of a 
point of E with respect to 2. We now consider the motion of a plane of E. To 
develop the necessary apparatus we note that according to (6.1) we may write, 
up to the second order,
X = X - yr + К - X + EZ )r2,
(7.1) 
Y = у 4- XT + J(- у + ме)т2,
Z = z 4- аот + l( - ex + Л )r2.
If we solve these equations for x, y, z, again up to the second order, we obtain
Xo= X,
x.= У,
x2 = - X - eZ,
(7.2)
y»= Y,
y.= “X,
y2= -Y -ец.
Zo = Z,
*1= “ (To,
z2 = eX - A.
The formulas (7.2) can also be obtained by considering the instantaneous
invariants of the inverse motion (Chapter II, (6.5)).
Let ax + by + cz 4- d = 0 be the equation of a plane u of E; by means of 
(7.2) its position in X, up to the second order is given by the equation
(aX + bY + cZ + d) +(aY - bX - ca0)r

as the dual counterpart of the formulas (6.1). During its motion the plane u 
coincides with a continuous set of »' planes in 2; the configuration thus 
generated is called a developable or torse, the dual of the path of a moving 
point. The differential geometry of a torse is less developed than that of a 
curve for the simple reason that it is more difficult to visualize its geometrical 
properties.
We consider first order concepts. At any instant the moving plane has a line 
of intersection m with its consecutive plane; m is the dual of a path tangent, it 
is called the characteristic of the plane under consideration. We have met it 
already in the previous section, there it appeared as the locus of the points for 
which the path tangents lie in a plane. The characteristic of the plane 
ax + by + cz + d =■ 0 in the zero position is its intersection with the plane 
- bx + ay - (Toc = 0 and its coordinates are therefore
p,4= -ac,
P23 = — aoac 4- bd.
(7.4)
p24 = ~ be.
P» = - anbc — ad.
pu = a2 + b2,
P» = - aoc2.
Eliminating a,b,c,d we obtain
(7.5) 
+ a0(p2u + ph) = 0
as the equation of the locus of all characteristics. It is the same as (6.4). Hence 
the locus of m is a tetrahedral line complex in 2, coinciding with the locus of 
the path-tangents. This is as expected, in view of the results derived in 
Chapter III on two positions theory.
By means of (7.4) it follows that to any plane of E there corresponds in 
general one characteristic. Conversely, to any line of the complex there 
corresponds one plane, as seen by the inverse formulas of (7.4):
(7.6) 
a : b : c : d = OoPi«p24: croph: P12P24  Pni&oPi  ~~ pu)-
* *
Some special cases may be mentioned. To the plane at infinity (a = b = c = 0) 
corresponds any line in it, as is of course what should be expected. A plane is 
parallel to its consecutive plane if in (7.4) pH = p24 = Pm «0, that is if 
a = b = 0 (u is orthogonal to the screw axis), or if c = 0, a2 4- b2 = 0 (u is 
parallel to one of the isotropic planes through the screw axis).
Example 35. Determine the characteristic of a plane through the screw axis.
In Section 6 we have derived that any line of the complex (7.5) corresponds 
to a point on it for which it is the path tangent; we see now that it corresponds 
also to a plane through it for which it is the characteristic.

Example 36. Show that the planes corresponding to the lines of the complex (7.5) through a point

a=-aoyw2, b = <roxw\ c=-w(x2+y2), d = z(x2+
which implies that the relationship is birational and of degree three.
Example 38. Show that the point P corresponding to the plane u is the tangent point of the 
characteristic of u and the complex conic in Uo; describe analagously the plane corresponding to a 
given point.
To summarize the first order properties of a moving plane u and to help 
visualize the results, we note that the first order situation of a moving space is 
completely determined by the instantaneous screw axis s and pitch <r0. 
Therefore by a suitable choice of the coordinate system any moving plane u 
(not parallel to s) may be given the equation x = ztan a, (that is a = 1, b = 0, 
c = - tan a, d = 0) so that a, the angle between u and s determines the 
situation. The characteristic m of u is its intersection with the plane (obtained 
from the first order terms of (7.3)): - bx + ay - aoc = 0, which in this case 
becomes у +<rotana = 0. The point P on m defined by (7.7) is seen to be 
(0, - <r0 tan a, 0). In the plane Uo, coinciding with u, we introduce the 
Cartesian frame OYRv, being the projection of the screw axis s on Uo (Fig. 
32). Then m is parallel to and OP = - <rotan a.
If Q is a variable point on m, its coordinates are x = qtan a, у = - aotan a, 
z = q, w = 1, q being a parameter. The path tangent I of Q joins Q to 
(<r0 tan a, q tan a, cr0,0); hence its line coordinates are

{0, - (cr£ + <?2)tan a/ao,0} and ORu (or the plane Oxz) at {(crj +q2)tan a/cy, 
0, (<To + <y2)/<y}; after some algebra it is seen that the equation of 1 in the ОУЯм 
frame reads
(7.9) 
aoy ~ q tan a ru + (al + q 2)tan a = 0,
where ru is the coordinate measured along ORu. This is a quadratic set of lines. 
Through any point of Uo, (y, ru) pass two lines of the set, corresponding to the 
roots of the quadratic equation
q2 tan a — qru tan a + a0(y + a0 tan a) = 0.
The envelope of the set is the locus of the points for which the two lines 
coincide. Hence its equation reads
(7.10) 
r2tan a - 4oro(y + crotan a) = 0,
which represents therefore the point equation of the conic in which the 
complex (7.5) cuts Uo. It is a parabola p, which is in accordance with the fact 
that any line at infinity belongs to the complex (7.5). The vertex of p is the 
point P, the tangent at P is the characteristic m. Elementary analytic 
geometry shows that the focus F of p is given by у = a0cot а, rw = 0. It follows 
from (6.8) that the null-point of the plane Ax 4- By + Cz + D = 0 with respect

to the linear complex L of normals is given by x = Ba(h у = - Atr0, z = - D, 
w = C. Hence the null-point of Uo reads (0, a0cota,0,1) and it coincides 
with F, a theorem due originally to Schoenflies [1886]; F is therefore the 
(only) point of u for which the path tangent is perpendicular to u.
We now consider some second order properties of a moving plane u of E. 
As it moves, this plane generates a torse in X Two consecutive positions of u 
define its characteristic line m; three consecutive positions of u define a point 
К at which they intersect, the locus of all points К is a curve к associated with 
the torse. The tangents of к are the characteristics, and the osculating planes 
of к are the planes of the torse. In the instantaneous position the coordinates 
of К are, in view of (7.3), for the plane (a, b, c, d), the determinants of the 
matrix 
or explicitly
X = psabc + Aac2 - Ea2d + aobc(- ea + c),
Y = Epb2c + аоа2с - <roac2 + Abe2 - rabd + tr0EC3,
(7.12) 
= (a2 + b2)(~ peb - Ac + d) — сгоеЬс2- Eaed,
W = (a2+ b2)(sa - c)+ sac2.
Hence the coordinates of К are cubic polynomials in terms of the coordinates 
of the moving plane u.
Example 39. Show that, conversely, the coordinates (a, b, c, d) of u are cubic polynomials of the 
coordinates (X. Y, Z. W) of K.
Example 40. Show that the matrix (7.11) may be derived from (6.11) if (LA, U4) is changed 
into (a. b, c, d), (x, y, z, w) into (X, Y, Z, W), and the instantaneous invariants into those of the 
inverse motion.
Example 41. Show from (7.12) that the locus of К for a set of parallel planes is a straight line.

Our first question may be: when does a line intersect itself in consecutive 
positions. The condition P14P234-p24/\i 4-pMPl24-p2,P144-p,,024 4-pl20M = 0 
gives after substitution of (8.1) (the constant term and the linear term vanish):
(8.2) 
pI2pM 4- <r0(p и 4- p24) = 0.
Hence the lines of the tetrahedral complex given by (8.2) are those lines which 
at the zero position are intersected by their next consecutive position. We 
have met this same complex already two times, in Sections 6 and 7 
respectively, but we must be aware that in the latter cases the complex was in 
2, while (8.2) lies in E. In the zero position the three coincide. We have dealt 
with this phenomenon in Chapter III on two positions theory.
Obviously the intersection point of a line I of (8.2) and its next consecutive 
position is the point given by (6.5): the point on 1 for which I is the path 
tangent. Indeed, the tangents of a path are the generators of a developable 
ruled surface, or, what is the same thing, a surface for which every two 
consecutive generators intersect.
Example 42. Verify (6.5) by using (8.1) and the coordinates of the intersection point of two 
intersecting lines p*  and q4.
In general the line I of E describes in 1 a ruled surface R which is not 
developable. Two properties of the first order are of interest: the striction 
point, S, of I with respect to R and the distribution parameter of 1 on R. To 
simplify the analysis we note, as we did in Section 7 with respect to the first 
order displacement of a plane, that first order properties depend only on the 
screw axis s and the pitch an. This enables us to introduce a suitable 
coordinate system for any line. Obviously we may restrict ouselves to a line 1, 
intersecting the X-axis orthogonally at S(a,0,0), and therefore given by 
x = a, z = ytan/3 (here, ft is the angle between I and the X, Y plane). Its 
coordinates in £ are

(0, - tan /3,1); if we intersect I with the plane through 1(t) and the direction n\ 
then for г —► 0 the point of intersection is S. Hence 5 is the striction point on 1. 
In general: the striction point on a moving line I is the foot, on I, of the 
common perpendicular n between 1 and the screw axis s. The tangent plane to 
the ruled surface R at S is the plane through 1 parallel to s. The normal to R at 
S is the line n (Fig. 33).

Its path is on R; the direction of the tangent to the path is (- и cosg, a, a0) 
and the tangent plane U to R at P(u) is seen to be
(8.5) 
(ao - a tan p)(X - aW)+ u(- Ysin /3 + Zcos/3) = 0.
For и = 0 we obtain the tangent plane Uo at the striction point S, for u = x the 
asymptotic tangent plane, orthogonal to the former.
*
 The coordinates of U 
are linear functions of the distance SP = u. In other words, the pencil of 
tangent planes through I and the point row on I are projective sets, as is the 
case on any ruled surface.
It is easily seen that the angle у between the tangent plane U, given by 
(8.5), and the plane Uo, satisfies tan у = u/(a0-atan Д). The distribution 
parameter of 1 on R is defined by и /tan y.
Hence the distribution parameter 8 of a line I, whose distance to the screw 
axis is a and whose angle with its normal plane is /3, is given by
(8.6) 
8 = a0 - a tan p.
Example 43. If 6 - 0 the tangent plane at any point of I coincides with Uu; show, for instance by 
means of (8.3), that such a line I belongs to the complex (8.2); show geometrically that I is the path 
tangent of S.
If (J is a point on the path tangent of P(u) on 1, the locus of О is given by
X = a-uvcosp, Y = ucosp + av, Z = usin /3 + anv, W = 1, 
which is therefore the representation, by means of the parameters и and f. of 
the raccording quadric of R along I. Eliminating и and v its equation is seen 
to be
(8.7) 
82(X - aW)W - (Ytan /3 - Z)(anY - aZ) = 0.
Example 44. Show that (he quadric is a paraboloid and (hat for 6 = 0 it degenerates into two 
planes.
These same first order results for a moving line will now be developed for 
the case where the line is in a general position. With s along Oz, if p„ are the 
coordinates of 1, the common perpendicular of 1 and the screw axis s has the 
direction (- p24, Pm, 0); the plane through s and this direction is pl4X + p24 Y =

is the complement of the angle between I and Oz, we obtain sin/3 =

Example 47 Show that the path tangent at S has the direction (PuPu.PizPm. ” <Мрм + рг34)} and 
verify that it coincides with I only if I belongs to the complex (8.2).
The striction point S on a moving line I and its distribution parameter 8 
with respect to R are first order covariants of the motion. We consider now 
some second order properties.
One of these is the tangent at S of the striction curve on R. To determine it 
we consider the striction point, denoted by S(r), on the line 1(t), the first 
order consecutive line of I. It is the foot on I(t) of the common perpendicular 
n(r) between 1(t) and the first order consecutive screw axis s(r) of s. 
According to (5.11) the coordinates of the latter are
(8.10) 
P41 = 0, P42 = ET, Р4з=1, Pn = 0, Pm = (/x - (Tu)eT, P|2

direction

The point S(t) that we seek is the intersection of this plane and the line l(r).

8 being the distribution parameter (8.9) of I.
For r = 0, (8.14) gives us the striction point S of (8.8). The direction of the 
tangent at S to the striction line follows from (8.14):
(8.16) 
- pl4B, — p2«B, -pMB+5.
Example 48. Show that (8.14) is in the tangent plane of R at S, as should be expected. 
Example 49. Show that the tangent at S to the striction curve coincides with I if I is a path 
tangent.
Other second order properties of a moving line deal with the curvature 
configuration of the ruled surface R at an arbitrary point P of 1. Of the two 
principal curvatures at P one is zero, the other one—in the plane through P 
orthogonal to 1—could be found by Euler's theorem because we are able to 
determine the curvature of another curve on R, viz. the path of P. We know, 
however, from (6.31) that this is expressed by a complicated function of the 
coordinates of P and for this reason we do not develop this line of reasoning 
any further.
There is another concept, associated with the generator of a ruled surface, 
which is studied in the differential geometry of lines. It may be defined by 
kinematical terminology. Consider the orthogonal triad T, with its origin at 
the striction point S and consisting of three lines through it: the generator 1, 
the normal n at S on R, and the line orthogonal to both and hence lying in the 
tangent plane. This triad could be regarded as a kind of (first order) 
representation of the system containing the moving line I. The position of T is 
a function of г and we may study the motion of T. This is obviouly different 
from the motion of E with respect to Д': S is not a fixed point on 1, the origin 
of T describes the striction curve which is not the path of a point of E. We 
consider the position T(0) of T for 7 = 0 and the consecutive position T(7); 
the latter follows from T(0) by a screw motion about an axis the limit of which 
for r—>0 will be defined as the “striction axis” of I and denoted by q. It is 
obviously a second order covariant of I.
To determine q we note that the motion of T may be considered as the 
result of the translation of S, which follows from (8.14), and a rotation about 
an axis q' through S. The direction of 1(7) is given by (8.1) to be 
{(Ph - Р247),(р2д + рмт),рм}; hence if S(7)Bj(7) is a unitvector on 1(7), B, is a 
definite point of T. If X(7), У(7), Z(r) are the coordinates of S(t), those of 
Bi(7) are

The rotation axis q' through S is perpendicular to both (8.17) and (8.18),

from which it follows that q' lies in the tangent plane. If a/ is the scalar 
angular velocity, of T, the vector co ' has in view of (8.19), the components

ш'= - N3ieN-',
which implies that co' has the components
(8.23) 
-ep2l4N~', -epup^N'1, - (- N 4- ep^p^N1.
Hence, the rotation part of the screw motion of T is now determined. It must 
be combined with the translation, which follows from the velocity of S. As the 
latter also lies in the tangent plane, the striction axis q, parallel to q', will 
intersect the normal n. Hence the theorem: the instantaneous screw axis s, the 
moving line I and its striction axis q have a common perpendicular.
To fix the position of q we must determine its intersection Q with n. If S' is 
the intersection of n and s, and we set S'Q = d, the coordinates of О are

The velocity of О caused by the rotation is equal to co' x r, where co' is given 
by (8.23) and the vector r by (8.25). If we add to this the translation velocity 
(- pl4B, - p24B4 - p^B + 6) we obtain the complete velocity of Q. The 
condition that this has the direction of co' gives us an equation for d. We

Show that the coordinates q„ of q arc polynomials of degree six in p„.

Determine the pitch belonging to (he axis q.
Our development is valid for any line I which is not parallel to the screw 
axis s. (For a line parallel to Oz we have p(4 = p24 = 0, hence N = 0; the 
striction point S on 1 is undetermined.) Our formulas become special for a line 
1 which is the path tangent of a point P; for such a line, belonging to (8.2), we 
have 6=0 and = - р^Рм-

Until now we have indicated a moving line 1 of E by its Pliicker 
coordinates p,f with respect to the canonical frame. Another way to do so, less 
symmetrically but more “geometrically”, makes use of cylindrical coordi­
nates. Let (r, h, ф) be the coordinates of the striction point S and 77 the angle 
of 1 with the Oxy-plane; we exclude the case rj = тг/2. (Fig. 34.) Then we have

9. A generalization of the Euler-Savary formula
In studying the motion of a line it is interesting to examine the limiting case 
of the (1,1) correspondence discussed in Chapter IV, Section 7. This means 
we seek the line I in the moving system which, to within the second order, 
remains at a fixed distance D and angle 0 from a given line Ц in £. Hence, if 
the Pliicker vectors of 1 are (/, Г) and those of lc are (/c, /'), we require that
(9.1) 
l-lc = cos0
(9.2) 
Dsin 9
be such that fc, /«, 0, and D remain constant up to the second order. If т is the 
motion parameter, we have for the first order
(9.3) 
(d//dr)-/c = 0
(9.4) 
(d//dr) • /: + (d/7dr) 4 = 0,
and for the second order properties
(9.5) 
(d2//dr2)-/c = 0
(9.6) 
(d2//dr2) • /; + (d2/7dr2) 4 = 0
The Pliicker coordinates of 1 in the canonical system are given by the vector 
components /(p,4, p24, рм) and Г(ркьрз\, Pu)', it follows that all the derivatives 
can be expressed in terms of pti and the motion invariants if we substitute eq. 
(8.1). In fact, (8.1) yields
(9.7) 
d//dr = (-p24,p14,0)
(9.8) 
d/7dr = (a«p24 - pJU p« - a0pi4,0)
which shows that (d//dr,d/7dr) are the Pliicker vectors of the common 
normal between 1 and the screw axis. From (9.3) and (9.4) it follows that this 
normal also intersects lc at a right angle. The result is that the screw axis and 
each conjugate line pair (1, Ц) always have one common normal as shown in 
Fig. 35. We call this common normal a ray and locale it relative to the 
canonical system by its intercept distance Л, measured along the screw axis.

and the ray angle ф, measured with respect to the X-axis of the canonical 
system. It should be noted that (9.7) and (9.8) are the Pliicker coordinates of 
the ray in terms of the coordinates of 1.
We introduce coordinates (r,a) and (rc,ac) which define the positions of I 
and lc, respectively, along the ray. These coordinates are all measured relative 
to the screw axis as shown in the figure. By referring to the figure it is possible 
to express the Pliicker coordinates of 1 in terms of the four coordinates (Л, <Д),

Similarly, if qif are the coordinates of lc we have:
(9.11) 
qu = sin acsin ф, q24 = - sin accos ф, qM = cosac
q2y = - rc sin ф cos ac - h sin ac cos Ф,
(9.12)
q3X = rc cos ф cos ac - h sin ac sin Ф, qi2 = rc sin ae.
Substituting from eq. (8.1) into (9.5) yields:

Into this we substitute from (9.9) and (9.11) to obtain

cot a - cot ac = 1/(e sin ф).
This can be considered as the Spherical Euler-Savary equation. It gives the 
correspondence between the inclination of I and L in terms of the ray angle 
and the second order invariant e. For spherical motions (9.14) defines the 
second order, (1, lc) correspondence; for spatial motions it gives only the 
angular part of the correspondence. The locational aspects are obtained from 
eq. (9.6):

Substituting eqs. (9.9)-(9.12), and (9.14) we find that

[r/sin2 a - re/sin2 ac]£ sin ф = h cot ф - 2a0 + p.
Once the angles a and ac are known, eq. (9.16) gives the correspondence 
between r and rc in terms of the ray coordinates (h, ф) and three invariants 
e, /л, <T0. (Note that it is independent of one of the second order invariants, Л, 
which has dropped out.) Clearly (9.16) is linear in r and rc, as expected.
Eqs. (9.14) and (9.16) together form the spatial analog of the Euler-Savary 
formula for planar motion (Chapter VIII, Section 9). They were first obtained 
by Disteli [1914] using an analysis similar to the derivation given in Section 8.
The following convention governs the signs: (r, a) and (rc, ac) are according 
to the right-hand-screw rule with the thumb pointing along the ray; the sense 
of the ray is such that 0^ ф < тг. (h, ф) are defined with the thumb in the 
direction of the screw axis. It should be noted that Ф. which is the angle 
between the X-axis and the ray, is the complement of the angle between the

axode tangent plane (i.e. Oxz) and the (single) plane denned by the spherical 
images of I, lt., and the screw axis.
10. Some general remarks
We make some general remarks on the four preceding sections.
In Section 6 we considered the locus of a moving point, its path, and the 
tangents and osculating planes of this path. In Section 7 we studied a moving 
plane, the set of its positions, its characteristics, and the curve which is the 
locus of the points of intersection of three consecutive planes. In both cases 
there appears a developable surface. However, it is obvious that the two 
configurations belong to essentially different concepts. In the first case the 
point is in E, the tangents and the osculating planes are in X; in the second the 
plane is in E, the characteristics and the enveloping curve are in 2. It is clear 
that an object of the first type is even different from that of the second type 
under the inverse motion.
In Section 8 the moving element is a line. In general its locus is not a 
developable ruled surface, but if it is, the resulting configuration is also 
different from the two types just mentioned: the tangent belongs to E, the 
points of the cuspidal curve and its osculating planes are elements of Z.
We add a remark about Sections 6, 8, and 9. In each a different curvature 
concept has been considered: In Section 6 the center of curvature of a point of 
a path and its radius of curvature; in Section 8 the striction axis and its pitch 
for a moving line which is a generator of a ruled surface; in Section 9 the 
center line which lies at a fixed distance and angle from a moving line.
In Chapter VIII, on plane kinematics, we shall see that there is for this 
special case a simple expression, the famous Euler-Savary formula, for the 
center of curvature M of the path of a moving point A. It contains of course 
instantaneous invariants up to the second order (only one in number in this 
case) and moreover A and M are collinear with the origin of the canonic 
frame. One has often tried to generalize this formula to spatial kinematics, 
but it is important to understand precisely which analog is being sought. If one 
remains bound by the notion of curvature the analog is far from satisfying as 
our results in Sections 6 and 8 clearly show. The best of the two is obviously 
that of Section 8; indeed, the moving line 1, its striction axis q and the screw 
axis s have a common perpendicular which is a reasonable analog for the 
collinearity of A, M, and О in the planar case. But we must keep in mind that 
the curvature configuration of I does not only depend on the distance d as

(CH. 6. §10
defined in Section 8, but also on the angle between q and s, and moreover on 
the pitch belonging to the axis q. That means that the analog if it is to be 
defined only in terms of curvature is incomplete per se, and that it does not 
seem to have been developed. On the other hand, substituting (8.9) into (8.26) 
removes the distribution parameter, and the analog seems much improved.
Using a different approach, we arrive at the same analog in Section 9. Here 
we identified line pairs for which the distance and angle between lines I in E 
and L in S remains constant to the second order of the motion of E. Each pair 
1, lc is analogous to the point pair A, M of the planar curvature theory. The 
collinearity of A. M, and the canonic frame's origin is now given by the 
condition that I, lc and s have a common perpendicular. This analog viewed in 
terms of “dualizing" the spherical analog of the planar theory seems to be a 
perfect one. This notion will be further developed when we discuss dual 
numbers in Chapter XIII, Section 5.
There is one other idea associated with the Euler-Savary equation which 
should not be confused with the former. There exists in plane kinematics a 
formula resembling the Euler-Savary one, but essentially different from it. 
We shall call it the second Euler-Savary formula. It deals with a relationship 
between the curvatures of the centrodes at their point of contact, the pole of 
the motion; it expresses the fact that these two curvatures, being obviously 
third order concepts, have a difference which depends on second order 
instantaneous invariants only. From this theorem follows a construction 
which enables one to find the center of curvature of any moving point if the 
pole and the centers of curvature of the centrodes are known. This is, of 
course, an inefficient theorem from the theoretical point of view, since it 
makes use of third order data to determine a second order covariant (this 
implies that it is a non-covertible construction: the knowledge of the center of 
curvature of any moving point does not enable one to derive the centrodes' 
centers of curvature), but it has its advantages in practice because special 
motions are often defined by their centrodes.
The problem to generalize the construction based on the second 
Euler-Savary formula to spatial kinematics was successfully solved by Disteli 
[1914J (see also Garnier (1954, 1956], Dizio6lu [1974], T6lke (1976), 
Veldkamp [1976]). He developed a method to determine the striction axis of 
any moving line when the striction axes of the screw axis on the two axodes 
are known. It will not be reproduced here; we refer to the respective 
literature and to our Chapter XIII, Section 5, where we use dual numbers to 
obtain this result. Disteli [1914] also derived spatial analogs of the Aronhold 
and Bobillier constructions of planar kinematics (Chapter VIII).

THE VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
191
11. The velocity distribution
Until now we have dealt in this chapter with geometric kinematics, 
considering the motion of E independent of the time scale. This enabled us to 
make use of canonic frames and a normalized parameter satisfying w = 1.
We consider now time-dependent kinematics. Our analytical apparatus is 
given by Chapter II, (4.5), modified by the special choice of the origin, which 
implies that (5.6) and (5.8) of Chapter II hold. Hence we have up to the 
second order
(ill)
Po = p, P, = x p 4- (ToCO,
P2= - ш 2p 4- f x p 4- (co • p )<u 4- Acu 4- /ле.
If we introduce the Cartesian frame, with Oz along co, the Ovz plane through 
ш and f, Ox along f x co, we obtain co = (0,0, u>), f = (0, f2, f3) and 
therefore
(11.2)
Xo= X, X, = - <oy,
Уо = у, У, = cox,
X2 = - co2x + e2z - Fjy,
У2 = F3X - CO2у 4- ДЕ2,
Z<> = z, Zi = crow, Z2 = - f2x 4- Aco 4-
the columns of (11.2) give us the instantaneous position, velocity and 
acceleration respectively. For <0 = 1, f2 = f, f3 = 0 the formulas (11.2) simplify 
to those for time independent motion.
Example 58. If L and T are the symbols for length and time respectively show that the 
dimensions of the coordinates and of trn (the geometric pitch) are L. that of <u is T’\ those of e, 
and h are A has the dimension LT'1, that of д is L.
If vt,vy,vt stand for the velocity components of the point (x, y, z) the 
“velocity distribution” of E is given by
(11.3) 
= - toy. Vy = COX, Vr = CToW.
It depends on the two parameters <0 and cro, which we suppose both unequal 
to zero, this being the general case. We now derive some properties of the 
distribution: there is no point with velocity zero. The scalar value v of the 
velocity is given by v2 = (x2 4- у2 4- а2п)ы2\ the locus of all points with the same 
given v is a cylindrical shell with axis Oz; the velocity is minimum for points 
on Oz.
The points whose velocity has a given direction (a, 0, y) satisfy 
- у : x . a0 = a : fl : у ; their locus is (if у / 0) a line parallel to the screw axis; 
they all have the same u. More interesting is the locus of those points P for

|CH. 6. § 11
which the velocity is directed to or from a given finite point A. In view of the 
screw symmetry of the distribution we may without loss of generality take the 
point as A = (a, 0,0). Then the conditions are
(x-a):-y = y:x = z:a0=u, 
и being a parameter. From this it follows that the homogeneous coordinates 
of P are
(11.4) 
x : у : z : и- = a : au : <rnu(l 4- u2): 1 + u2.
Hence the locus is (for a/0) a twisted cubic. It passes through A (for и = 0), 
through the point at infinity on the screw axis (for и = »), and through the 
isotropic points of the Oxy-plane (for 1 + u2 = 0). On the portion of the cubic 
corresponding to и >0 the velocity is directed from A, while for the portion 
и < 0 it is directed towards A. For v we have v2 = w2{a20 + a2/(\ + u2)}, which 
implies that, of all the points on the cubic curve, A has the maximum velocity. 
We have already met this cubic locus in Section 6; it lies on the (quadratic) 
cone of A with respect to the tetrahedral complex (6.4).
We now turn to investigate the velocities of the points on a line 1. If 1 
coincides with the screw axis s all points have equal velocity, directed along s; 
if I is parallel to s the velocity vectors are parallel and in one plane. For the 
general case we may restrict ourselves to the line x = a, z = у tan v. An 
arbitrary point on it is (a, u, и tan v) and this point has as velocity vector 
(- юн, аш, oo<o). The endpoint of the velocity vector has the coordinates 
(a - wu, и + ж и tan v 4- <row), hence the locus of the endpoints of the 
velocity vectors for all points on I is a line 1'. Since v2 = ш2(и2 4- a2 4- <rj), the 
velocity is a minimum if и = 0, that is for the striction point of 1.
Example 59. Show that as ю varies the locus of the endpoints of the velocity vectors of I is the 
quadric surface (X - a tan + (Z - Y tan v)(<7oY - aZ)-0.
Example 60. Show that this quadric is a hyperbolic paraboloid and that the two systems of 
generators are given by u - constant and ш • constant.
Example 61. Show that the angle Ф between I and Г satisfies cosi/r ® (1 + ш2cos’ v)',л.
Example 62. 
Show that I and I' intersect if <ro = a tan v\ the paraboloid degenerates and I belongs 
to the line complex (8.2).
The direction of 1 is (0, cos f, sin i/), hence the projection on I of the velocity 
of a point P on I is ш(а cos v 4- <rnsin p), this is the same for all points. This 
projection is zero if tan v = - a/<r0. Obviously then, if one point of a line 1 has 
its velocity directed normal to 1 so do all points of 1. This implies that all path 
normals have this property: the velocity of a point P is along the tangent to its 
path and therefore perpendicular to any normal. The conclusion is, in view of 
(6.8), that any line 1 of the linear complex of normals has the property that the 
velocity of every point on it is perpendicular to 1.

THE ACCELERATION DISTRIBUTION

Example 63. Prove directly that I belongs to the linear complex if tan p = - ala^.
Example 64. Determine the paraboloid of Example 59 if I is a path normal and show that it is 
orthogonal.
We consider now the velocity vectors of the points of a moving plane u 
of E.
In the general case u has an intersection with the screw axis and in view of 
the symmetry of the distribution u may be given the equation x = ztan a, as 
we did in Section 7. A point P in u is then (z tan a, y, z) and its velocity vector 
reads (- wy, coz tan a, oxr0). The direction of a normal on u is (cosa,0, 
— sin a). Hence the velocity vector of P is normal to u if and only if x = z = 0, 
у =a0cota. This point Po is the null-point of u with respect to the linear 
complex of the path normals. Its velocity is v = oxr0/sin a.
Points in u for which the velocity vector is in u satisfy у + <rotana = 0; 
hence, in view of Section 7 their locus is the characteristic m of u. The velocity 
vectors of these points coincide with the tangents of the conic, in u, of the 
tetrahedral complex (7.5).
Example 65. If u is parallel to the screw axis it may be given by x = a; the velocity of P(a, y, z) of 
u is (- coy, oxi, croco). Show that: points on the line x « а, у ж 0 have their velocity vectors in u, all 
these vectors are parallel and of equal length, and that the line is the characteristic of u. Show 
also: that a point not on it has a non-zero velocity component perpendicular to u; that for all 
points of u the velocity component in u is the same, and that there are no points with a velocity 
normal to u.
The endpoints of the velocity vectors of the points of m are on the line 
m' = {(ow + q)tan a, (ajq - a0)tan a, q + aoa>)}, q being a parameter; it in­
tersects m, in accordance with the fact that m belongs to the tetrahedral 
complex (7.5).
The endpoint of the velocity vector of an arbitrary point of u is given by
X = z tan a ~ coy, Y = у + coz tan a, Z = z 4- coaf„
у and z being parameters. This verifies that these endpoints are in a plane. It 
intersects u along a line which is the locus of the endpoints of the characteris­
tic of u.
Example 66. Determine the equation of this plane.

Any point with its acceleration directed along its path tangent has no normal 
acceleration and therefore its path curvature is zero; hence the locus of all 
such points is the inflection curve ((6.13) and also Chapter IV, (14.3)).
Example 69. Determine the inflection curve from the condition a « ки, к being a scalar. Show 
that it is the curve (6.13). Prove that it is a non time-dependent concept.
Example 70. Show that Ao> 4- is the tangential, and дс2 the normal component of the 
acceleration of the origin. Prove that the curvature of the path of О is equal to l/R e 
and that the center of curvature M is (0, R,0); prove that R is time-independent; show that it is in 
accordance with formula (6.30).
The condition a = 0 implies three linear equations for x, y, z. This suggests 
that in the general case (i.e., we2X 0) there is one point Г, which we call the 
acceleration pole, with zero acceleration. From (12.1) it follows that Г is the 
point
X = (AW + /1Ез)/е2, У = {(Aw + Д£3)ел+ /XE2}/w2E2, 
(12.2) z = {(Aw + /xe3)(w4 + e2) + ^Е22Еу}1ш2е22.
Obviously Г is a point on the inflection curve.
To study the acceleration distribution we introduce a Cartesian frame 
with its origin at the acceleration pole and axes parallel to those of Ot,t. From 
(12.1) it follows that if the origin has zero acceleration A = p, = 0, and the 
acceleration of a point P = (f, rj,p) is seen to be
(12.3) 
(-w2f+ e2p, E3f - w27|, -E2f).
We remark that the acceleration distribution towards Г depends only on w 
and e, invariants of the rotational part of the motion. This is however not true 
for the position of Г. As the three components of a are homogeneous linear 
functions of the coordinates, we obtain: all points on a line through Г have 
parallel acceleration vectors; the magnitude |a| is proportional to the radius 
vector ГР. We have (f,ii,p) • (ait ap) = - w2(f2 + 172). Hence there is one 
line through Г, the coordinate axis Гр, all points P of which have their 
acceleration vector orthogonal to ГР; the acceleration has the direction Г4 
and its value is t2p.
Points P whose acceleration is directed along ГP satisfy
(12.4) 
- w2f - e3tj + E2p =/if, c3f - w2tj =/177, -E2f = /ip.
Eliminating the coordinates we obtain a cubic equation for the parameter h:
(12.5) 
/i’ + 2w2/i2 + (w4+e1+e23)/i + w2e! = 0.

Hence there are three lines lt, 12, l< through Г (two of them may be imaginary) 
such that any point on 1, has its acceleration along 1,; these lines shall be called 
the (instantaneous) acceleration axes.
The coefficients of (12.5) are all positive; therefore, if a root of (12.5) is real 
it is negative. The conclusion is: if a line l( is real the acceleration of any point 
on it is directed towards Г.
From (12.3) it follows that a is equal to the sum of two vectors a( = 
(- o>2f, - a)2rj, - ш2р) and a2 = (-

- f+ <*> 2p). The first has
the direction РГ; hence a point on 1, satisfies a2 = -hiHi, i.e.,

Eliminating £, 77, p we obtain for the new parameter hx

which is of course equivalent to (12.5). The angular velocity vector a> is 
(0,0, u>), the angular acceleration e = (0, £2>fs), and the angle a between 
them is given by cos a = eJe, with f2 = f24-£2. If we introduce the non­
negative number к = е2/ш4, we obtain for (12.6):
(12.7) 
h J - h2 + khi - к cos2 a = 0.
After some algebra the discriminant of (12.7) is seen to be
(12.8) 
D = 4k2 4- (27cos4a - 18cos2a - l)k +4cos2a,
and the condition that фс three acceleration axes are real and distinct is
(12.9) 
D<0;
if D > 0 one is real and two are imaginary. The examples cos a = 0, к < 1, and 
cos2 a = 1, show respectively that both cases are possible.
Example 71. Show from (12.8) that a necessary condition for (12.9) to be valid is cos2 a < 1/9.
Example 72. 
Show that if the three acceleration axes are real, the trihedron with edges I. (or the

opposite side. (Bottema [1965].)
Example 73. 
Show that there are two velocity and acceleration distributions corresponding to the 
same acceleration axes. (Bottema (1965|.)
From (12.3) it follows that the locus of those points P which each have an 
acceleration vector with the same given scalar magnitude |a | is the quadric О 
with the equation

which shows, by virtue of Descartes’ Rule of Signs, that the three roots 
Si, (which are always real) are all positive. Hence Q is an ellipsoid. The 
roots must satisfy the equation
(si + s2 + $э)2 - 4($2$з + $j$i + s15г) = 0,
and, as sf is proportional to the square of the reciprocal of the semi-length of the 
principal axis of Q, we obtain for the reciprocals of the semi-axes lengths bl9 b2, b3:

or
(12.12) 
(b, + b2 + M “ b. + b2 4- b3)(b. - b2 4- Mb. 4- b2 - by) = 0,
which shows that the ellipsoid О has the following property: the reciprocal of the 
shortest axis is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the lengths of the other two 
principal axes.

A plane of E can be specified by giving the coordinates f, rj, p of its points P 
as linear functions of two parameters n and t2. Then, by (12.3), the 
components of the acceleration of P are linear functions of Ti and r2, and the 
same holds for the coordinates of the endpoint of a. Hence, the locus of the 
endpoints of the acceleration vectors of the points of a moving plane u is a 
plane, u' say. In general u and u' have a line of intersection, Г. Hence the locus 
of those points of u which have their acceleration in u will be a line 1.

CHAPTER VI!
SPHERICAL KINEMATICS
1. Spherical displacements
We have seen in Chapter I that for a general displacement of the 
three-space E with respect to the fixed space У there is no invariant point. 
This chapter deals with those special displacements for which a point, O, does 
not move. For the equation (Chapter I, (4.5)) of a displacement this means 
that, taking the fixed point О as the origin, the displacement of О rep­
resented by the vector d, is identically zero. Hence a displacement is given by
(1.1) 
P = Ap
in any coordinate system for which the origin coincides with the fixed point. A 
is an orthogonal matrix. A consequence is that the degree of freedom of E, 
which is six in the general case, reduces to three. Furthermore we know that 
for any such displacement not only the point О but any point of a certain line 
s through О is invariant. Hence any such displacement is a rotation about a 
line through O.
*
 The direction of a line (through O) is determined by two 
data, and as the displacement is known if s and the rotation angle ф are given, 
we see once more that the degree of freedom of E is three.
For a point P, different from O, the distance |OP| = R must be constant. 
This implies that the locus of the possible positions of P is the sphere (O; R). 
Hence our displacements are such that any point moves on a sphere with 
center O. That is the reason why this special branch of our science is called 
spherical kinematics.
If Si = (O, R|) and S2 = (O, R2) are two spheres, Pt a point on Sb and P2 that 
intersection of OP, and S2 for which OP2/OP, is the positive number R2/R,, 
then any configuration of points P2 is obviously directly similar to that of the 
corresponding points P,. This implies that we may restrict ourselves essen­
tially to the motion on one of the concentric spheres.
Another remark seems of interest: As P moves on its sphere, the line OP

(CH. 7. J 2
moves about O, and its position is known if we know that of its intersection P*  
with the plane at infinity V. Hence a displacement of P corresponds to that of 
P'. Spherical kinematics is therefore related to the study of certain transfor­
mations in the plane V. We know that spatial displacements have the property 
that the isotropic conic О in V is—as a whole—invariant. The plane geometry, 
dealing with those linear transformations for which a non-degenerated conic 
is invariant, is known as a non-EucIidean geometry. If the conic is imaginary, 
as in our case, the geometry is called elliptic. Hence there is a strong 
relationship between kinematics in plane elliptic geometry and spatial spheri­
cal kinematics. The two concepts are essentially identical (or isomorphic, as 
mathematicians call them), since the point P' of V corresponds to one line 
OP' and conversely. This isomorphism is only valid if we study the displace­
ment of lines. For points this is not true, since a point P' in V corresponds to 
two points situated diametrically opposite on the sphere. The analog would be 
complete if two such points would be identified with each P'. We remark that 
non-Euclidean kinematics has been the subject of systematic research, for 
instance by Garnier [1951]. We shall deal with it in Chapter XII.
2. The lines joining homologous points
The n-positions theory we developed in Chapter III—VI simplifies consider­
ably in spherical kinematics.
If two positions are given, the second always follows from the first by a 
rotation. If we take the rotation axis as Oz and rotation angle as ф, the 
coordinates of the positions P,, P2 of two homologous points are related by
(2.1) 
X, = x, Y. = y, Z, = z
and
(2.2) 
X2 = хсоъф - у sin ф, Y2 = xsin ф + усо5ф, Z2 = z,
provided we take the coordinate frames in E and 2 coincident in position 1. 
If Pi is not on Oz, then P, and P2 are different and their join is a line parallel 
to the Oxy plane. Conversely, assuming ф/ tt, any line parallel to OXv, not 
intersecting Oz, is the join of one point pair P)P2. If Pi is on Oz, P2 coincides 
with PB; their join is undetermined since any line through Pi must be 
considered as the join P,P2. The conclusion is that the locus of all joins PtP2 
consists of two special linear complexes: one consisting of the lines intersect­
ing the line of Oxy in V; the other, of all the lines intersecting Oz. In the 
general case the locus was seen to be the quadratic complex (Chapter III,

in spherical kinematics the displacement d is zero and t
degenerates into two linear complexes.
Example 1. Verify that for d 3 0, the complex degenerates into the two special linear complexes. 
Example 2. Consider the special case Ф = n.
Example 3. Show how the other results of two-positions theory derived in Chapter III are 
modified for spherical kinematics.
3. Three positions
Three positions theory, as developed in Chapter IV, is of course simplified 
for the case at hand, but the results are less trivial than for n = 2.
In the general case, three positions were completely determined by the 
three screw axes s23, s31,S|2 (or s1fS2,s3); we formed this configuration into a 
spatial triangle by adding the three common normals nt,n2, n3 of the pairs 
S2S1, SiS|,SiS2 respectively. In spherical kinematics the screw axes are rotation 
axes, all three passing through О and thus are the edges of a trihedron T with 
the vertex O. All three normals also pass through O, establishing a second 
trihedron T, often called the polar trihedron of T. (Conversely, T is the polar 
trihedron of T.) According to Chapter IV, Section 1, three homologous 
points Ab A2, Aj are the reflections into the edges of T' of the fundamental 
(or basic) point A • of £. In the plane V at infinity the situation is the same as 
in the general case: three homologous points are the reflections into the 
points N, (of n.) at infinity, of a point A * in V, or, what is actually the same 
thing, the reflections of A * into the sides of the polar triangle of with 
respect to П, these sides being the lines at infinity of T.
In Chapter IV, Section 3 we derived the correspondence between the basic 
point A * = (xHx2,x3) and the plane a(Ub l/2, Uj, U4) through the three 
homologous points A<, the result being a birational cubic relationship between 
A * and a. We may do the same thing in spherical kinematics, but we are 
faced with a difference: If A * is reflected into the normal nb along which a 
unit vector (а„ 0„ %) is chosen, the coordinates of A, = (X4, Yh Z,) are seen to 
be
Xt = (2а?- 1 )xi + 2atp,x2 + 2a,y(x3,
(3.1) 
У. = 2Дад> + (20?- l)x2 + 20,%x3,
Z, = 2%аД| + 2%0д2 + (2y?- l)x3.
As in the general case these are linear functions of xb x2, x3, but they are now 
also homogeneous linear functions. Therefore in the matrix (3.1) of Chapter 
IV the functions Ly are now homogeneous. This implies that UXy U2, Us are 
homogeneous quadratic functions and U4 is a homogeneous cubic function of

SPHERICAL KINEMATICS
[CH. 7. §3
xb x2, Xv A conclusion is that, for a given sphere (O. R), two basic points on a 
line through О correspond to parallel planes a, a fact which follows of course 
directly from the similarity with respect to О of diametrical opposites as was 
mentioned before. All this has an important influence on the question 
whether three homologous points can be collinear. In the general case we 
found two loci for A *,  a twisted cubic c for finite points, derived from the 
condition that the matrix (3.1) of Chapter IV has a rank of two, and a plane 
cubic c' in V, with the equation x4 = 0. In spherical kinematics three 
homologous points are on the same sphere about O, which implies that in 
order to be collinear at least two of the points must coincide and therefore A * 
must lie on a rotation axis. For instance if A2 and Ay coincide they are on sb 
which implies that their base point A * is on s>. Hence, the cubic curve c is 
degenerated into the three edges of T. The curve c', however, is in general a 
non-degenerate plane cubic.
A point A has three positions A, on its sphere, and it seems natural to ask 
for those points whose three positions are on a great circle. As this means that 
their plane passes through О the condition reads U4 = 0; hence triplets with 
this property have their basic point on a cubic cone, with vertex O, which 
obviously passes through the plane curve c' at infinity. Clearly then the A, 
also lie on cubic cones. The locus of the points A( (i = 1, or, 2, or 3) on a given 
sphere is therefore the intersection of this sphere and the corresponding cubic 
cone.
The plane cubic c' at infinity is the same as for general kinematics and it has 
the properties mentioned in Chapter IV, Section 4. It passes through the 
rotation axes at the three points S»,S.ibS|2 and moreover through the 
intersections with О of the polar lines of S,2 with respect to fl. Indeed: 
all these nine points have the property that two of their three positions 
coincide.
Example 4. Determine the equation of c' as a function of a„ fl.. y. by means of (3.1). Show that the 
cubic cone passes through the edges of T and through the isotropic points in the faces of T. 
Example 5. Show that the locus of the planes through О which contain three homologous points 
is a cone of class three.
In this section we have dealt with the general three positions theory in 
spherical kinematics, the positions being defined by three arbitrary axes 
through O. There are many special cases.
Example 6. Prove the theorem named after Rodrigues and Hamilton: Successive rotations, 
about three concurrent lines of X, through angles equal to twice the angles of the planes formed 
by the axes, restore E to its original position. (Hence, as we already know, any two successive 
rotations about a fixed point can be replaced by an equivalent single rotation.)

FOUR AND FIVE POSITIONS

Example 7. Consider the case where the three rotation axes are mutually orthogonal. Consider 
the case where the three rotation axes are coplanar.
4. Four and five positions
We consider now, in spherical kinematics, four positions of the moving 
space. As any one of them follows from any other by a rotation, we obtain six 
rotation axes. The axis of the displacement from position j to position к will 
be denoted by s,k (/, к = 1,2,3,4,/# к) and its point at infinity by Sfk. Two 
axes with no common index will be called complementary or opposite; there 
are three pairs of opposite axes: (Si2,sM), (s^Sj^, (sshSm).
As in the general case, the six axes are not independent. We shall study 
their configuration, which will be seen to be much simpler than in the general 
case where they must belong to a certain congruence of lines. Two pairs of 
opposite axes may be chosen arbitrarily, for the two remaining axes we derive 
a locus, which will be of course a cone with vertex O.
Let Si2,Sm and sJt,S42 be given; the unknown axis sn will be denoted by p. 
Let S/ь be a vector along s,fc with Cartesian components а,*,  y/k; p is a 
vector along p, and its components are x, y, z. Obviously alkt 0/k, ylk are the 
homogeneous coordinates of S,k in V; x, y, z are those of the point P which is 
the point of p at infinity.
As we know from general kinematics the condition for p is the following: 
the angle between the planes (p, S|2) and (p, sM) must be equal to that between 
the planes (p,S42) and (p, Su).
The normal л to (p,sJ2) is p x Si2, the normal л' to (p,sn) is p x j5l; the 
angle between these planes is фм/2 and we have
(4.1) 
tan(<£24/2) = |л x л'|/(л • л').

SPHERICAL KINEMATICS

The equation L=0 represents the plane (s12,s3t). The equation K = 0 
represents a quadratic cone, passing through s)2 and s3i; it is the locus of the 
lines p for which (ф23/2) = тг/2. We have ф23 = 0 if L = 0 or if p is isotropic 
(i.e., W = 0). The angle ф23 is undetermined if p coincides with Sn or s3b (L 
and К being both zero) and also if W and К are both zero. This is true for the 
four intersections of К and the isotropic cone ft; from this it follows that 
these four lines are in the tangent planes through st2 and s3( to Q.
Example 8. Prove the last statement analytically.
Example 9. Show that the locus of lines for which ф» is a constant is a quartic cone.
The same angle, ф23/2, is also the angle between the planes (p, s^) and 
(p, sM); we obtain a formula analogous to (4.2), L and К being changed into 
L' and K' (by substituting s42 for st2, and for s3!). The condition 
tan(<f>23/2)= tan(</>23/2) then implies that the locus of s23 (and of s,4), if sI2,sM 
and s3|,s42 are known, is represented by
(4.4) 
LK'-L'K=0.
this locus is therefore a cubic cone Г, passing through s12,S34,s3ltS42. If s23 is 
chosen (any generator of Г), the four positions are completely determined; s14, 
also on the cone, is determined and so are the six rotation angles associated to 
the six axes. In our derivation we started from the pairs (su, s^) and (s42,sM); 
the result would have been the same if we had chosen (s12, s42) and (s3b sw).
It follows from the definition of Г that it passes through the intersection of 
the planes (sI2,s3i) and (s42, sM), (which is also obvious from (4.4), L and L' 
being both zero) and through that of (s12,s42) and (s^.s^). Such intersections 
yield the third generator of Г lying in the planes containing two axes. As the 
six axes are equivalent we have in general: the intersection of the planes 
(syfc, sA) and (s/m, srw), (j, k, /, m being mutually different) is a generator of Г.
Example 10. Show that there are six such special generators.
Example 11. Show that the (four) intersections of К and K' are on Г.
Example 12. Determine the equation of К if fl2 = (a,0,1) and f,i » ( - a,0,1).
The cubic cone Г has been derived earlier, it is of course the configuration 
we called the screw cone in Chapter V, Section 3. In Chapter V our interest 
was to develop the general case and so we did not dwell on the relationship 
between the spherical indicatrix of a configuration and spherical kinematics. 
Clearly though, any aspect of a general displacement which is completely 
described by its spherical indicatrix must have an equivalence in spherical 
kinematics. So it is for Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter V: they can be read as 
describing four position spherical kinematics and they could without any 
change be inserted in this section.

Example 15. Show that the six тг-directions discussed in Chapter V, Section 4 coincide with the 
six special generators of Example 10.
Example 16. Show that (8.1), (8.2), (8.3) of Chapter V all apply to spherical displacements and 
that in this case the 1.Д correspondence discussed in Chapter V, Section 8. gives those lines 1» 
which have four homologous positions on a quadratic cone, and Ц is the cone axis.
Example 17. Show that for five positons there arc at most six real l„ l( pairs.
In Section 3 we have found that the locus of the basic point A * for which 
the three positions A, of A are on a great circle of their sphere is a cubic cone 
with vertex O, its intersection with V being a cubic c'. Four positions give rise 
to four such curves, which we denote by С|2э,Сгм,Смь and c4l2. An intersection 
of Сш and Сгм, for example, gives us four homologous points A,, A2, Ay, A4, 
with the property: OA^A2Ay and OA2AyA*  are coplanar. This implies (hat 
the four points are coplanar provided that A2 and A*  are different. The two 
cubics have nine intersections, but both pass through S23 and through the 
isotropic points of the plane perpendicular to S23. The conclusion is: in 
spherical kinematics there are on any sphere, about O, in general six 
quadruples of homologous points (real or imaginary) lying on a great circle.
The rotation (1.1) about О is given by a homogeneous linear transforma­
tion of the coordinates x, y, z in E to X, Y,Z in Z. If four displacements are 
given such that (x, y, z) is transformed to X„ Y„Z, (i = 1,2,3,4) the four 
(finite) homologous points A, are on one plane if the determinant
IX X Z 1|
is equal to zero. Developing this determinant with respect to the last column 
we can see that: there exists in E a cubic cone, with vertex O, such that the 
four positions of any point on it are coplanar, and therefore on a circle of their 
sphere. As four points are coplanar if two of them coincide, the cubic cone 
passes through the six rotation axes sy taken as lines in E, these are the axes 
for the inverse displacements; the so-called image screw axes.
Example 18. Show thac the lines from О to the isotropic points perpendicular tosv do not belong 
to the cone (a general point on such a line does not have two coinciding positions).
If five positions are given we have ten rotation axes s/k (/, к = 
1,2,3,4,5; J?
*  k). We may ask for those points for which the five positions are 
coplanar and therefore concyclic. Omitting first one position, say the fifth, and 
then a different position, say the fourth, we have two four position problems. 
Each (i.e., 1234 and 1235) gives rise to a cubic cone as the locus of coplanar 
points, and therefore the nine lines of intersection of these two cubic cones

must contain the required locus. Since both cones pass through axes sI2,s23, 
and Sii (taken as image-screws in E) which do not satisfy the condition, the 
points we seek are those of the remaining six lines, through O, common to 
both cones. These lines could perhaps be named after Burmester who solved 
the analogous problem in plane kinematics. These six lines are not necessarily 
real: they may be imaginary in pairs.
Example 19. Verify that the I.J, line correspondence, discussed in Chapter V, Section 10, yields 
exactly this same result. Which phrased in terms of the l„L correspondence says that for five 
positions (under spherical displacements) there are at most six lines which each have their 
homologus positions on right circular cones, and that these cones have the six lines l< as axes. 
(Roth [1967a].)
5. Instantaneous spherical properties
In general instantaneous kinematics, the derivatives of the coordinates of a 
moving point (for the canonical frame) are given by Chapter II, (6.3). They 
simplify for spherical kinematics because a0 = Л = д = d3x = 
= dir = 0.
We obtain
Xn=x, X,= -y, X2=-x+ez, X3 = (1 + e2)y + yYz,
(5.1) Y0=y, Y. = x, У2 = -у, 
У3= -(l + Их+((3/2)e-yx)z,
Zn=z, Z, = 0, 
Z2=~ex, Z3 = - yYx +((3/2)s + yx)y.
There are no geometric instantaneous invariants of the first order; one, e, of 
the second; two, yx and yY, of the third.
A moving point (x, y, z) has, up to the third order, at the instant r the 
position
X = x - yr - i(x - ez)t2 + (1/6)[(1 + e2)y 4- yYz}?\
(5.2) У = у 4- хт - Jyr2 - (1 /6)((I 4- e2)x - ((3/2)e - yx)z ]t\
Z = z -kxr2-(l/6)[yyx - ((3/2)e 4- ух)у]т\
X, У, Z are homogeneous linear functions of x, y, z. It is easy to verify that the 
coefficients (of x,y,z) are, up to the third order, those of an orthogonal 
matrix. This means that the inverse of (5.2) is obtained as the transpose of its 
coefficients. Hence, if we solve for x, y, z from (5.2) we obtain:
x = X 4- Ут - J(X 4-eZ)t2 - (1/6)[(1 4-e2) У 4-уvZ)t3,
(5.3) у = У - Хт - 1Ут2 4- (1/6)[( 1 + е2)Х4 ((3/2)е 4- yx)Z]T\

which gives us the inverse motion, up to the third order, with respect to the 
canonical frame of the direct motion.
From (5.2) it follows that the points of E which are, for т = 0, at a cusp of 
their path are those of the z-axis, different from O.
Example 20. Show that the cuspidal tangent has the direction of the X-axis.
We consider for the time being second order properties; they depend only 
upon the invariant e, which we suppose unequal to zero. The osculating plane 
of the path of (x, y, z) is the plane U through three consecutive points; hence 
it is the plane through (x, y, z, 1), (- y, x,0,0) and (x - ez, y, ex,0), which gives 
us (if x and у are not both zero)
Ui = £x\ (J2 = EXy, Uy- -(X2+ y2-EXZ),

C/4 = “ EX(x2+ y24-Z2)-h z(x2+y2).

is the equation of the cubic cone which is the locus of those points whose 
paths have three consecutive points in common with a great circle. It is the 
instantaneous case of the cone considered in Section 3 (which deals with three 
finitely separated positions).
Example 21. Show that for any point P on O,. different from O, the osculating plane is not 
determined; any plane through P parallel to Ox is a possible osculating plane.
Example 22. Show that the cubic cone К has a double line (being then rational) only if e = ±|: 
the double line being x = ± z, у « 0.
The system of path normals is trivial in this case. For a point A (x, y, z), not 
on O„ the direction of the tangent is (-y,x,0) and the normal plane 
- yX 4- x Y = 0 passes through Oz. Any normal intersects Oz; the locus of the 
normals is the special complex with Oz as axis; its equation is p12 = 0, in 
accordance with Chapter VI, (6.8), the pitch <r0 being zero in this case.
If P is a point on Oz, any line 1 through P is a normal at P, in fact it is even a 
principal normal. It is a binormal of P if I is in the Ovz plane. The principal 
normal at a point A is the join of A and the intersection of Oz and the 
osculating plane (5.4) of A.
In the general case we have found that a normal is the principal normal of 
two of its points, real or imaginary. In the case at hand, if 1 is a line through P 
on Oz, one of these points is P; the second is then also real.
Example 23. If I through P is given, determine the second point on I for which I is the principal 
normal.

Show that the binormal al (x.y,z),x^0, intersects Oz at (0,0, (x2+y3)/ex).
Example 25. If I is a line intersecting Oz determine the point on it whose binormal is I.
Curvature theory gives rather simple results for spherical kinematics. The 
curvature axis is the intersection of two consecutive normal planes. We know, 
however, that a normal plane also contains the rotation axis; hence the 
consecutive normal plane contains the consecutive rotation axis. But as all 
rotation axes pass through О this implies that the curvature axis of every 
point passes through O. This axis is perpendicular to the osculating plane. The 
conclusion is: the center of curvature of a point A coincides with the 
projection M of О on the osculating plane of A. The radius of curvature p is 
|AM|. The osculating circle to the path at A is the intersection of the 
osculating plane of A and the sphere with radius R on which A moves.
From (5.4) it follows that the distance |OM| = d satisfies
(5.6) 
d2 = K2/N,
with
(5.7) 
N = e2x2(x2 + y2) + (x2+y2-exz)2.
Hence
p2= R2- d2 = (R2N -K2)/N.
We obtain
R2 N - K2 = R 2e 2x 2(x2 4- у2) + R 2(x2 + у2)2 - 2 R 2exz (x2 + у2)

Check that M coincides with О if A is a point of the cone (5.5).
In spherical kinematics every path lies on a sphere: they are all spherical 
curves. In differential geometry a concept has been introduced which is a 
generalization of elementary curvature. (In plane geometry the curvature of a 
curve is a measure of its local deviation from a straight line, the tangent at the 
point.) If A' is a consecutive point of A, the curvature is defined as the limit of

distance AA'.
For a curve p' on a given surface F there has been introduced the notion of 
geodesic curvature, which is a measure of the local deviation of p', al a point 
Afrom the geodesic on F which is tangent to p' at A. Its definition is similar 
to ordinary curvature except that Да is now the angle between the geodesics 
tangent to p' at A and A' respectively.
In the case at hand F is a sphere and the geodesics are its great circles. We 
determine the geodesic curvature of an arbitrary circle c' with radius r on a 
sphere with radius Ry at the point A. Making use of spherical coordinates, 
chosen so that the Z-axis coincides with the circle axis (Fig. 36), the points of 
c' are given by

curvature of c' reads kK = R ’’ cot /3. a well-known formula in the differen­
tial geometry on a sphere.
The geodesic curvature of the path is obviously the same as that of its 
osculating circle. Furthermore we have cot /3 = d/p; hence we obtain for the 
geodesic curvature of a path

the inflection cone of the position. We can transform (5.10) into a spherical 
coordinate system, in which the Z-axis coincides with the screw axis. Using
x = Rsin 0 cos 77, у = Rsin 0 sin tj, z = Rcos0, 
the result is
(5.11) 
k  = (- € cos t) 4- sin 0 cos0)/(R sin2 0).

The center of curvature (i.e., the center of the osculating circle) M is on the 
line OM with the direction (-ex2, - Exy, x24- y2- exz) or
(5.12) 
(- e sin 0 cos2 17, - e sin 0 cos rj sin 17, sin 0 - e cos 0 cos 17),
which intersects the sphere at two points, one of them M' being the spherical 
center of the osculating circle or the “spherical center of curvature” for A. 
The plane О AM is yX - xY = 0; it passes through A and Oz since it is the 
normal plane to the path of A. Hence, if we call the point 0=0 the north pole 
P on the sphere we have: the point A, its (spherical) center of curvature M\ 
and P are on a great circle, the meridian through A. Furthermore, if the angle 
POM' (that is, the spherical distance PM’) is denoted by 0', it follows from 
(5.12) that
cos0'= (sin 0 - e cos0 cos 17)/[e2cos217 sin 0 cos0 cost? 4- sin20],/a, 
or after some algebra
tan 0' = (- e sin 0 cos 17 )/(sin 0 - e cos 0 cos 17).

Therefore we obtain
(5.13a) 
£ (cot 0 -cot0')cosi7 = 1»
which is the relationship between the point A (0,17) and its spherical center of 
curvature M'(fi\tj).
(5.13) is called the Euler-Savary formula, it is named for the two men who 
derived the analogous relationship in planar kinematics. If 17 = тг/2, A is in 
the Oyz plane, we have 0' = O, hence in this case M' coincides with P for 
any 6.
The angle ту is measured to the plane OAM from the normal plane of the 
axodes (i.e., plane OXOZ; as is shown in the next section). If instead we use 
the angle from the axode tangent plane: we define the angle from the OYOZ 
plane to OAM as ф. Hence ф = rr/2 + 77 and (5.13a) yields the alternate form
(5.13b) 
e(cot 0 - cot 0')sin ф = 1.
The positive sense of ф is according to the right-hand-screw rule with Oz as 
axis. Obviously ф is also the angle between axis Ox and the normal to the 
plane OAM. We have given here an alternative derivation of equation (9.14) 
of Chapter VI: the angles Ф, 0,0' in (5.13b) are in fact respectively Ф, a, ae of 
Fig. 35 in Chapter VI.
6. Third order properties
In the preceding section we dealt with second order properties, they 
depend only on the invariant e. We consider now third order phenomena so 
that also yx and yY have to be taken into account.
The axodes of the spherical motion are cones with vertex at O. Their 
intersections with a sphere about О will be called the polhodes on that 
sphere.
It follows from (5.2) that, up to the second order, the components of the 
geometric velocity of a moving point are
X' = - rx + [ - 1 + J(1 + е2)т2]у + (ет + ЬуТ2)х,

here we recognize the skew matrix of the general case (Chapter II, (5.11) with 
Chapter II, (6.2) substituted) the coefficients being the components of the 
angular velocity vector Л. From (6.2) it follows that, up to the second order, 
the fixed axode is seen to be
(6.3) 
X = R(-k4-Jyx)r2, Y = Я (ft 4-Jy^r2), Z = R(1-Jf2t2),
R being a proportionality factor.
Similarly, by differentiating (5.3) and substituting (5.2), it follows that the 
moving axode, again up to the second order, reads

Example 29. Show by means of (6.1) that for (6.4) we have X’ = Y'e Z'»0.
Example 30. Check that both cones pass through the instantaneous rotation axis Oz and that the 
common tangent plane through Oz is the plane X ■ 0; this is in accordance with our definition of 
the canonic frame.
Example 31. Show that for a constant value of R. (6.3) and (6.4) are the intersections of the 
axodes and the sphere (O;R).
We shall call the intersections of the axodes and the sphere with R = 1 the 
polhodes of the spherical motion. The formulas (6.3) and (6.4) enable us to 
determine the curvatures of the polhodes in the zero-position.
The plane through three consecutive points of the fixed polhode passes 
through (0,0,1,1), (0,1,0,0) and (~k + ух, yv, - e2,0). Hence this plane is 
e2X - (k - yx)Z + (к - yx) = 0. The normal, through O, to this osculating 
plane intersects the meridian Y = 0 (which is the normal plane of the polhode 
at P) at the point Q\ the center of curvature of the polhode. If Z.POQ' = f' 
we obtain
(6.5) 
cot f' = - (к - yx )/e2.
Similarly, for the moving polhode, the center of curvature at P being Q and 
LPOQ = & we have
(6.6) 
cot £ = (к + Ух )le
From (6.5) and (6.6) follows a relationship between the (spherical) radii of 
curvature of the fixed and moving polhodes:

THIRD ORDER PROPERTIES

There is a formal resemblance between (6.7) and (5.13), but they are 
essentially different. (5.13) expresses a relation between a moving point and 
the center of curvature of its path, (6.7) gives a correspondence between two 
centers of curvature. But, still more important: 0 and 6' in (5.13) are second 
order concepts while f,are third order notions. An interesting feature of 
(6.5) and (6.6) is the fact that £ and depend on the second order 
instantaneous invariant e and on only one of the third order ones, viz. yx, and 
that yY does not come into the picture.
The formulas (5.13) and (6.7) have given rise to some confusion in 
theoretical kinematics. To distinguish the two we shall call (6.7) the second 
Euler-Savary formula.
If P, О and Q' are given, it follows from (6.5) and (6.6) that e and yx are 
known. This implies that only one of the two third-order invariants is 
determined by these data. In particular it is obviously not correct to say that 
third order properties of a motion are the same as those of the motion defined 
by the rolling of the circle (Q;f) on the fixed circle (O'; £'); E and Ух are the 
same for both, but yY shall in general be different.
Third order properties deal with four consecutive positions of a moving 
point. We know from Section 5 that there is a locus of lines which have three 
positions in one plane (which means on any sphere a locus of points for which 
three positions are on a great circle). We may expect a finite number of lines 
through О for which four consecutive positions are coplanar. On the sphere 
this means that four consecutive positions of a point are on a great circle; 
making use of the terminology of plane geometry, such a point should be 
called a (spherical) undulation point of its path.
From (5.1) we infer that the condition for such points to exist is that the

the fourth or the third column must be zero. This gives us, respectively, the 
condition K = 0 (5.5) and
(6.9) K' = (yxy - уYx )(x 2 4- y 2 4- z2) 4- (3/2)ey (x2 4- у2 - z2) = 0.
Furthermore, the rank of the matrix consisting of the first and the second 
column must be equal to two, which implies that the three points x = у = 0, 
and x24- y’ = z = 0 must be excluded. Hence the points we seek are the

intersections of the cubics К = 0 and K' = 0, minus these three points (lying on both) 
which count as five intersections due to the fact that the curves are tangent at the points 
x2 + y2 = z = 0. Hence there are in general four points on a sphere which are at a 
given instant at an undulation point of their path. They are called Ball points, after R. 
Ball who was the first to derive them for the analogous question in plane kinematics. 
The number four is in contrast with the result in Section 4 for four finitely separated 
positions.

The locus of those points is therefore a cubic cone, C, which will be called the 
circling-point cone. It contains the z-axis and the isotropic lines in the plane 
z = 0. As the z-axis is a double generator, the cone is a rational one.

7. Fourth order properties
If we want to investigate fourth order instantaneous kinematics, the 
expressions X4, У4, Z4 as functions of x, y, z must be available. We did not 
derive them in the general case, the necessary algebra being rather compli­
cated. We shall determine them here for spherical motion. They will be 
homogeneous linear functions of x, y, z, say X4 = <JiX 4- a3y + ajZ, 
У4 = bjx 4- b2y + biz, Z4 = CiX + c2y + c3z. Then, in view of (5.2) the matrix 
transforming x, y, z into X, У, Z will be, up to the fourth order,

The condition that (7.1) is orthogonal up to the fourth order implies the 
following six equations for the unknowns a„ b„ c,:

(l/6Xa«x + a2y + a>z)r3, (l/6)(6,x + b2y + 6jz)t3, (l/6)(c,x + c2y 4- сэх)т3
respectively. The coordinates x,y, z are obtained as functions of X, Y, Z by 
the inverse matrix of (7.1), that is by its transpose. Eliminating x, y, z we get 
X', Y', Z' as functions of X, Y, Z, these being the extension, to the third 
order, of (6.2); the elements of this skew matrix are the components, in the 
fixed frame, of the angular rotation vector A After some algebra we obtain

parameter is normalized so that Q2 = 1. From (7.3) it follows that D2 = 1, up to 
the third order, if

a2 = 3eyY.

free numbers give us the two fourth order instantaneous invariants say, qx 
and qY, we expected. We take, for instance, a, = 2yx 4- qx, by = 2yY - qY; then 
c, = 2yx - qx, c2 = 2yY + qY. The result is

+ Z4(x2 + y2 - exz) = 0. Their sections with the plane at infinity are the cubics 
c and c', having nine common points. We know that c has a double point at 
(0,0,1), the tangents being x = 0 and у = 0; moreover it passes through the 
isotropic points (1, ±t,0). The curve c' passes through (0,0,1), which is an 
ordinary point of c', the tangent being x = 0; it does not pass through the 
isotropic points. Hence c and c' have three intersections, at x = у = 0, which 
must be rejected. The number of points with five consecutive positions on a 
circle (real or imaginary) is therefore six. They are named after Burmester, 
who solved the analogous problem for five finitely separated planar positions. 
If we substitute the coordinates of c, as functions of the parameter и 
(Example 33) into c' = 0 we obtain an equation of degree six for the 
Burmester lines; i.e., the lines from the origin of O,yf through the intersec­
tions of c and c'.

TIME DEPENDENT MOTION

8. Time dependent motion
So far we have only considered geometric spherical kinematics. Now we 
turn to time-dependent motion. We shall restrict ourselves to the velocity and 
the acceleration distribution.
From Chapter VI, (11.2) we have, in view of a0 = Л = 
= 0,
Xo = x, X, = - шу, X2 = - ш2х - e3y + e2z,
(8.1) 
У0=у, У| = шх, 
У2=€3х-ю2у,
Zo = z, Z, = 0, 
Z2 = - e2x.
ш is the angular velocity, e2 and e3 are the components of the angular 
acceleration vector along OY and Oz.
The velocity distribution is that of a rotation about Oz with angular 
velocity ш.
X2,Y2,Z2 are the components of the acceleration a, of the point A = 
(x, y, z), along the coordinate axes; the acceleration pole of the general case 
now coincides with O. As A moves on a sphere we determine the components 
of a along the path tangent, the meridian, and the radius OA; the direction 
numbers of these three direction are, if A is not on Ot, (~y, x,0), (xz, yz, 
— (x2 + y2)), and (x, y, z) respectively. Hence the tangential component aly the 
normal component any and the radial component a, are
a, = (e3(x2+y2)—e2yz)/(x2+y2)l/2
(8.2) 
= (e2x (x2 4- у2 + z2) - u> 2z (x2 + у 2))/((x2 + у2 + z 2)ш(х2 + у 2),/2)
a, = - w2(x2 + y2)/(x2 + y2+z2)l/2
a, is always directed towards O.
The normal component an is zero if
(8.3) 
(e2x/o>2)(x2 + y2 + z2)- z(x2 + y2) = 0,
that is for points on the spherical inflection cone К (5.5); it is a time­
independent locus.
That is not the case for the points with a, = 0; their locus has the equation
(8.4) 
Q ж <э(х2+y2)-e2yz =0,
which represents a quadratic cone. (Sometimes called the normal cone, 
because its points have only normal acceleration along the sphere.)

К passes through O„ and through the isotropic lines z = 0, x2 + y2 = 0, and 
so does Q. Rejecting these, К and Q have only three generators in common, 
the acceleration axes we met in Chapter VI, Section 12. Hence, in spherical 
kinematics, there are three points (real or imaginary) on the sphere which have 
no acceleration along the sphere ; they could be called the spherical accelera­
tion poles.

CHAPTER VIII
PLANE KINEMATICS
1. Introduction
If P and p are the position vectors of a point in the fixed and the moving 
space respectively we know that the general spatial motion is represented by
(1.1) 
P = \p + d,
A being an orthogonal matrix and d the vector displacement of the origin; the 
number of degrees of freedom is six. If a (finite) point О is fixed during the 
motion and if this point is taken as the origin, we have d = 0. We then no 
longer have a general motion, but are dealing instead with spherical kinema­
tics, the subject of Chapter VII; as d = 0 is equivalent to three conditions the 
number of degrees of freedom reduces to three.
We consider now the case of a point at infinity being fixed during the 
motion. If this point is given the homogeneous coordinates (0,0,1,0), we must 
have in A = |a4/1 the relations а1Э = а2з = 0, which imply in view of A being 
orthogonal that = a32 = 0, a3J= 1. The motion is then represented by
X = x cos ф - у sin ф 4- dj,
(1.2) 
Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + d2,
Z = z + dy\
it has, obviously, four degrees of freedom. Indeed, the condition that a point 
at infinity remains invariant is equivalent to only two relations.
It is easy to analyze a motion of the type (1.2). It is built up of a plane 
motion, every point remaining in its plane parallel to Oxv, followed by a 
translation in the direction of Oz; in all planes parallel to Oxv the motions are 
congruent, that is they are essentially the same. Every plane parallel to Oxr is 
transformed into a parallel plane. It is easy to see that the screw axis of the 
displacement is parallel to Oz; the rotation angle is фу and the translation

along the screw is dy. The fixed and moving axodes are cylinders with their 
generators parallel to Oz; any point of a generator may be taken as its 
striction point. The motion of the moving axode on the fixed one is a 
combination of rolling and sliding just as in a general spatial motion, but the 
axode configuration is much simpler in this case.
Of the two components of the motion (1.2) the planar part is by far the 
more interesting, and we shall restrict ourselves to it by dealing only with the 
case dy = 0. As, moreover, the motions in the parallel planes are all the same 
the study may be limited to the motion of the plane z = 0. The subject of this 
chapter is therefore plane kinematics. The basic approach in this book has 
been to start with the general case and to specialize later on, accordingly we 
have arrived at plane kinematics as a subcase of spatial motion. It is of course 
possible to develop it autonomously, if we restrict ourselves from the start to 
two dimensional geometry.
The condition dy = 0 reduces the parameters of (1.2) to ф, d, and d2. Hence 
the number of degrees of freedom is three.
It is understandable that plane kinematics is historically the most ancient 
part of our science. Because of its relative simplicity it is by far the most 
developed branch. Moreover the applications of theoretical kinematics to the 
analysis and synthesis of mechanisms — a subject not treated in this book — 
deal mainly with the planar part.
Plane kinematics depends on three degrees of freedom, the same number 
as for spherical kinematics. The planar case is by far the more simple of the 
two. In the spherical case the d, are zero so the three parameters are all 
enclosed (or hidden) in the orthogonal matrix and we need — as was shown in 
Chapter VI — Eulerian angles or parameters to exhibit them explicitly. In 
plane kinematics the orthogonal matrix degenerates so as to depend only on 
the single parameter ф; the two remaining parameters are decoupled and 
may be taken as translation components. It cannot be denied on the other 
hand that spherical kinematics is more elegant and more “homogeneous”. 
We have seen that, looking at the plane at infinity, it is isomorphic with a 
non-Euclidean (i.e., elliptic) geometry, while plane kinematics as a matter of 
fact is Euclidean. For instance elliptic geometry is completely self-dual, points 
and lines being equivalent concepts; in the Euclidean plane the line at infinity 
is a special line without a counterpart among the points. Non-Euclidean 
geometry, defined in the projective plane, deals with the group of linear 
transformations leaving the (absolute) conic invariant; in the Euclidean plane 
the absolute is degenerated into the two isotropic points, and planar 
displacements are those transformations which leave these points invariant.

However, for plane (Euclidean) kinematics we also require that the determi­
nant of the linear terms in the transformation matrix equals unity. If we drop 
the latter condition we have equiformal kinematics with four degrees of 
freedom, on which some remarks will be made in Chapter XII.
2. Two positions theory
It follows from our general theory that if we are given two positions E, and 
E2 of the moving plane E with respect to the coinciding fixed plane X, E2 
follows from Ei by a rotation about an axis perpendicular to I or by a 
translation. A direct proof follows from Fig. 37. Let Ab A2 and Bt, B2 be two 
pairs of homologous points, which implies | AiBj = | A2B2|. The perpendicu­
lar bisectors of AXA2 and BXB2 intersect at P. Then |PB|| = |PB2|, |PAi| = 
|PA2|; hence the triangles PAXBX and PA2B2 are congruent, LAXPBX = 
/LA2PB2, from which it follows that Z.A,PB, - LA2PBX = LA2PB2- LA2PBX 
which we write as LAXPA2 = Z_BXPB2 = ф. A rotation about P by the angle ф 
transforms Ax into A2 and Bl into B2 and therefore any point of Ex into the

homologous point in E2. Point P is called the pole of the displacement or 
simply the pole (or center; or the roto pole — for rotation pole). If we wish to 
indicate which two positions are associated with the pole, say i and /, we will 
use subscripts, i.e. P4. The perpendicular bisectors are parallel if A|A2 and 
BsB2 are parallel; E2 then follows from E, by a translation, and the pole is at 
infinity. An analytical proof is the following. Let the frames OXY and ожу in Z 
and Ei coincide. The displacement of E, into E2 may be represented by
X = x cos ф - у sin ф 4- a,
Y = x sin ф + у со$ф + b.
(This follows also from (1.2); clearly di = a, d2 = b.) An invariant point P 
follows from (2.1) if we specify the conditions X = x, Y = y, after some

equal and therefore the triangles OjO'M and MP'P are similar. (In the figure point о is displaced

X-axis.)

3. Three positions theory
A displacement can be represented as a product of two reflections as 
follows. Through pole P12 we take any two lines ni and n2 of 1 which, in 
addition to intersecting at Pi2, are at an angle of ф|2/2 measured from nt to n2 
(Fig. 39). If A * is an arbitrary point of 2, and A< is its reflection into nh then 
A, is transformed into A2 by a rotation about center Pi2 by angle ф12. This 
follows from |PiaAi| = |P|2Ae| = (PuAal and £.А}РХ2А2 = ф(2. (The state­
ment is the planar version of the theorem given in Chapter I, Section 6.) If P)2 
is at infinity (ф!2 = 0) we take ni and n2 parallel, with distance d/2 (Fig. 40); A2 
then follows from A, by a translation, perpendicular to n( and with distance d. 
Conversely any displacement of E (a rotation or a translation) may be 
considered as the product, in the appropriate order, of two reflections. 
Obviously there are infinitely many such reflections representing any dis­
placement. If the displacement is a rotation about P>2 with angle ф12 the line 
nt may be chosen arbitrarily through PX2, n2 is then determined; analogously if 
the displacement is a translation ni may be chosen arbitrarily, perpendicular 
to the direction of translation. These properties enable us to treat three 
position theory in plane kinematics using a similar, but of course more simple, 
development to that used in our study of three position spatial kinematics 
(Chapter IV).

intersect. If A । is an arbitrary point of E1 and A * its reflection into nh then A2 
and A3 are the reflections of A * into n2 and n3; this implies that A3 follows 
from A2 by successive reflection into n2 and n3. The conclusion is that the 
intersection of n2 and n3 is the center P23 and obviously any triple Ab A2, A3 
of homologous points is found by reflecting a point A*  into nt, n2, n3 
respectively. There are two different cases, given by Figs. 41 and 42, 
distinguished by ф|2 + ф^<2тг and ф12+ ф3!>2тг. In the first case the 
orientation of the triangle P|2P23P3i is clockwise; in the second case it is 
anti-clockwise. Our result reads: the three positions of E are determined by 
the triangle of the three rotation centers P|2P23P3H the pole-triangle. This 
figure is comparable to the screw-triangle in spatial kinematics and the 
trihedron of rotation axes in the spherical case. The three rotation angles are 
twice the angles of the triangle; it follows easily from the figures that they 
must be taken with orientation determined so that фч is measured from the n< 
to the n, side of the triangle; one has always ф12 + Фгз + Фи = 0(mod. 2тг). А

Example 7. Determine the triad of homologous points if A * is on n, or coincides with РФ
Let A*  be the basic point of a triad AjA2A3 (Fig. 44); since |P|2Ai| = 
|Pi2A *|  = |P|2A2|, the triangle A|P)2A2 is isosceles. The perpendicular 
bisector m>2 of A,A2 coincides therefore with the bisector of the angle 
AtP|2A2, this implies that Z_n,Pl2fnl2 = Z.A *Pi 2n2; in other words: m12 is the 
reflection of A *P| 2 into the inner (or outer) bisector of the angle П|Р12п2, or, 
as the geometers have it, ml2 is isogonally related to A *P| 2 with respect to the 
angle П|Р12п2. As A * is an arbitrary point, and for any three positions, ти, 
п>2з, m3l are concurrent (since they pass through the center of the circle 
defined by A,, A2, A3) we have proved the geometrical theorem: if a point О 
is joined to the vertices of a triangle, the isogonally related lines pass through 
one point O'; О and Q' are said to be isogonally conjugate with respect to 
the triangle (Fig. 45).
Example 8. Show that the relation between Q and (?' is commutative.
Example 9. Show that a vertex of the triangle is isogonally conjugate to any point on the opposite 
side (and hence every point on a side is isogonally conjugate to the opposite vertex).

Example 13. Show that the relationship between Q and Q' holds if the triangle has a vertex at 
infinity; the “bisector" through this vertex is the line half-way between the parallel sides.
From the above theorems we infer: the circumcenter M of three homolo­
gous points АхА2Аз is isogonally conjugate (with respect to the pole-triangle) 
to their basic point A*.
If three homologous points are collinear their circumcircle degenerates and 
the center M is a point at infinity. Conversely (in view of the commutativity of 
the isogonal relationship) a triad of collinear points has a basic point 
isogonally conjugated to a point M at infinity. In Fig. 46 the pole triangle and 
the direction of M are given; let LMPi2P2i = Ф- We construct A ♦; the angles 
indicated are all equal to ф, If the angles of P^P^Pn are a2, then 
£PmPi2A * = ф ~ a3, Z.A ШР31Р|2 = 7Г - (Д - a2, hence Z.P12A *P 31 = n - 
This implies that A * is on the circumcircle of the pole triangle; conversely any 
point on this circle has its isogonal conjugate at infinity. The locus of the basic 
points of three collinear homologous points is the circumcircle c*  of the pole 
triangle.

circumcircle) that the locus of A  passes through the vertices.

Therefore in general: if Ab A2, A3 are a triad of collinear homologous points, 
and if the line through them is mA, then mA passes through H. The locus of 
lines which can be drawn through three homologous points is the pencil in 2

We have derived the theorems associated with three positions by means of 
geometric arguments. Here follows an analytic treatment: According to (2.1) 
a position of E with respect to £ is given by the three numbers (ф, a, b). For 
the three positions determined by (ф„ ah b,), i = 1,2,3» the three homologous 
points A, in 2, of the point A = (x, y) in E, are collinear if
(3.1) 
|x соьф. - у sin ф, + a, x sin ф, + у cos<£. + b, l| = 0,

У (a2 cos фу - ay cos ф2) + 2 (k sin фу - by sin ф2) у
+ S (ъЬу- ayb2) = 0,
which confirms that the locus of A is a circle c. Clearly (3.1) is satisfied if two 
rows are equal, which affirms the fact that c passes through the rotation 
centers. From (3.2) we see that c is degenerate if two angles ф, are equal, that 
is if a relative displacement is a translation.
Example 19. Show that when A  coincides with the orthocenter H of the pole triangle, the circle 
through the three homologous points A(, A3, A3 is the circumcircle of the pole triangle.

Example 20. Show that when A  coincides with the incenter of the pole triangle, the circle 
through the three homologous points A,, A3, A, has a radius equal to twice the radius of the

The triangle formed by three homologous points is similar to the pedal 
triangle of the basic point A * with respect to the pole triangle. Pedal triangles 
have been extensively studied objects in plane geometry. Of the many 
theorems we mention only: with respect to any triangle there are always two 
(real) points — called isodynamic points — whose pedal triangles are 
equilateral. Transposed to our case we have: if three positions of a plane are 
given there exist two triads of homologous points which are each the vertices 
of an equilateral triangle.

So far we have, in three positions theory, studied homologous points. We 
deal now with homologous lines. Obviously three homologous lines lh 12,13 are 
obtained by reflecting a basic line Iе into the sides of the pole triangle. We ask 
now which lines are displaced so that their three homologous positions are 
concurrent. Let S be their common intersection. In Fig. 49 the pole triangle, 
the line 13 and the point S on it are given; l2 follows from 13 by the rotation 
(Py2>2ai), hence there is a point S' on 13 which is transformed into S, which 
implies that LQ1P23S = au Q, being the projection of P23 on 13. Similarly lt 
follows from 13 by (P3I,2a2), hence Z.Q2Pji$ = a2- Therefore Z_P23SP3I = 
|a,| + |a2| = 77 - |a3|. The conclusion is: the locus of the point S, the 
intersection of three concurrent homologous lines, is the circumcircle of the 
pole triangle. On the other hand (Fig. 49), if S is a point on the circumcircle, 13 
is found by the condition that Z_P23S13 = (tt/2)-a( = Z.P23P12H; hence 13 
passes through H3, which generalizes to the fact that 1, passes through Ht. In 
other words: the basic line I*  of three concurrent homologous lines passes 
through H, and conversely any line of the pencil through H is a basic line Iе of 
a set of concurrent homologous lines.

In order to treat the problem, of concurrent homologous lines, analytically 
we make use of the formulas (2.5). If three positions are given by (ф,,аьЬ), 
i = 1,2,3, the condition for concurrency reads:
(3.3) 
|uiCOS(/>, - u2sin ф, и, sin фi + u2cos ф, 4- b,u2 + u,| = 0, 
r
which gives us an equation of the third degree for ub u2, u3. Developing this 
determinant with respect to the third column it is seen to be

Hence the locus degenerates. It represents three pencils of lines, two of them 
having their vertices at the isotropic points /ь h of the plane; this is as 
expected because these points are invariant under any displacement. Disre­

coordinates of those lines of E whose three positions are concurrent (at a 
point S) may be written as linear functions of a parameter A. Then it follows 
from (3.3) that the coordinates of S (being the minors of two rows) are 
quadratic functions of A ; hence the locus of S is a conic. But the pencil with 
vertex T contains the lines Tlx and TI2, and for these lines S coincides with 
and I2 respectively. This implies that the locus of S is a circle, which is in 
accordance with our former results.
Comparing the two methods we have used to treat three positions theory, 
the geometric and the analytic, it could be said that the former is attractive, 
giving a visual impression of the situation, but not exact, since it depends on 
one particular choice of the data; the second is exact, covering all cases, 
bringing into light imaginary solutions, but formal and not accompanied by an 
elegant configuration. The advantages and disadvantages are those of the 
graphical construction method on one hand and the algebraic and computa­
tional one on the other. In the study of kinematics, historically the first 
method has prevailed, in modern times there is a strong tendency in favor of 
the latter.
Example 28. In the special case of three positions, an analytic treatment can be chosen which 
makes use of triangle coordinates with respect to the pole triangle. Let (X. Y, Z) be the 
homogeneous coordinates (the ratios of the distances from the sides) of a point in the fixed plane.

4. Four positions theory
We deal now with four positions E, (i = 1,2,3,4) of the moving plane E 
with respect to the fixed plane £. Obviously there are six rotation centers Pit 
= 1,2,3,4; i#/) and — as in the corresponding situation in spatial and 
spherical kinematics — they are not independent. For the case under 
consideration the reasoning is as follows. In Fig. 50 the pole triangles for 
positions 123 and 234 are shown; obviously they must have equal angles at 
their common vertex P2j, both being \ф2у. Hence, if two pairs P!2, PM and P|3, 
P42 of opposite centers are given (a pair of opposite centers is composed of 
two centers without a common subscript), Pn must have the property that 
seen from this point the optical distances PI2P3i and P^Pu are equal in size 
and orientation (or, what is the same thing, PI2P42 and РяРм have the same

(German: Pollagenkurve). It passes through the intersections of the circles 
C12 = 0 and Cm = 0 and therefore through the isotropic points Zj and Z2: hence 
К is a circular cubic. It passes through the intersections of Ll2 and Си, which 
are P12 and P3b and also through the intersection of LM and Cm (i.e., Pm and 
P42), therefore we know that all six centers P(/ are on K. Furthermore К passes 
through the intersection of Lt2 and LM, that is of P12P13 and P^Po; this

first that РцРм and Р4гРм are not parallel and let their intersection be taken

2[(vt + u2)sin a - i(vt - u2)cosa J(X + iY) + (u2Vi - UjU2)iZ = 0,

Hence at F Lu/Cu = L34/C34, and the conclusion is: F is a point of K.
In the case, excluded so far, that P12P31 and P4}PM are parallel, the 
derivation of the equation for К is slightly different: We take the X-axis 
halfway between the two parallel lines (Fig. 53). Then Pi2 = (pi,h), P3I = 
(р!,/1), Р42 = (р2,-Л), Рм = (р5,“Л); putting p.-p>u, р<+р2=ц 
(i = 1,2), we obtain
(4.8) 
L12= v,(- У + Л), Ct2 = X2 + Y2 - u.X - 2hY + l(u?-t>?)+Л2.

L54 and C34 may be obtained from (4.8) by replacing u(, t?i by u2, v2 and h by 
- h. The equation for К is now
(X2 + У2)(-v,+ v2)y + h(v. + v2)(X2- y2)Z + (u2t>l-u1t>2)XyZ + 
<4,9) 
+ (k'lX + k',Y + k',Z)Z2 = 0,
where к !, к 2 and к J represent terms containing only uh v, and h. The principal 
focus F(x0, y0, Zo) is now at
(4.10) 
x0= m2Vi- 
yo= -2/i(i>i + v2), z0 = 2(vi~ v2)\
after some algebra we obtain
L)2(Xo/Zo, y0/Zo)/C|2(xo/z0, Уо/Zo) =
=(8h(v,- v2))/(16h2 + (U|- и,)2-^- v2)2),
which does not change if uh u2, th, v2, h are replaced by u2, uif v2, Vi, - h. 
Hence F is a point of K.
A circular cubic which passes through its own principal focus is called focal. 
Focal cubics are well-known in the theory of special plane curves. For 
instance: the locus of the foci of the conics tangent to four given lines is such a 
curve (Salmon [1954]). Our conclusion is: the pole curve for four positions of 
a plane is a focal cubic.
The coordinates of the focus F are given by (4.6) and (4.10) respectively. In 
the first case zo/0 (because |cos2a | X 1); in the second case we have z0 = 0 
only if V, = v2 = v. Hence F is a finite point, unless the given pairs P12, and 
P3i, P42 (of opposite rotation centers) are opposite vertices of a parallelogram. 
If they do form a parallelogram, it follows from (4.9) that К is given by
(4.12) 
Z[2hv(X2- У2) + v(u2- u>)XY + (k\X + k'2Y 4- k\Z)Z] = 0.
Hence the theorem, first given by Burmester [1888, pp. 620-1]: if P12, PM and 
Pji, P42 are opposite vertices of a parallelogram the pole curve degenerates 
into the line at infinity and an equilateral hyperbola.
In all other cases F is a finite point and it can be chosen as the origin. If we 
take, moreover, the У-axis parallel to the (real) asymptote of К the equation 
for K, (4.4), simplifies to
(4.13) 
X(X2 + У2) + а(Х2 + У2)+Ь.Х + Ь2У = 0.
In this standard form of the equation there appear three parameters a, bb bz; 
these are functions of the coordinates of the four given poles, and they 
determine the shape of the curve. We derive from (4.13) the following

procedure to generate K. The asymptote is seen to be X + a = 0; we consider 
the line 1 with the equation X = - ja. half-way between F and the asymptote 
(Fig. 54). On any line Y = ЛХ through F there lie, besides F, two points S,» S2 
of K. Their X-coordinates satisfy X2(l + A2) + Xa(l + A2)+bi + Ab2 = 0, 
hence their midpoint M is on 1. A circle with center M(-|a, ~iAa) has the 
equation X2 + Y2 + a(X + A Y) + Ja2(l + А2) - Я2 = 0; if it passes through Slt 
S2 we have Ja2(l + A2)- R2 = b, + Ab2. Hence the circle with SiS2 as a 
diameter reads
(4.14) 
X2+ Y2 + aX + b» + A(aY + bj) = 0,
which for variable A represents a pencil of circles. This implies the following 
point-wise construction of K: intersect the variable line FM and that circle of 
the pencil whose center is M. This is essentially one of the constructions to 
generate К given by Burmester in a purely geometrical way (Burmester 
[1888, pp. 614-16], Beyer [1953, pp. 79-80]).
The pencil (4.14) consists of the circles through two basic points Q, and Q2, 
which are the intersections of the circle X2 + Y2 + aX + bi = 0 and the line 
а У + Ьг = 0. There are two main cases: Qt, Q2 can be either real or conjugate 
imaginary, depending on whether D is positive or negative in

It is easy to verify that the two finite intersections of К and 1 are real 
(imaginary) if D is negative (positive). In the latter case 1 separates the two 
circuits of K, (Fig. 55), in the former there is only one circuit (Fig. 56). If 
D = 0, we have Qi = Q2 = Q and К has a double point at Q (Fig. 57). Indeed, 
both 1 and FQ have two coinciding points Q in common with K.

Example 44. If D # 0 the curve К has no double point; its genus is one. К is elliptic and could be 
represented by means of elliptic functions. Its class is six. Through every point of К pass four lines 
tangent to К at other points. For F, two of these are isotropic; prove that it depends upon the sign 
of D whether the remaining two tangents are real or imaginary.
The pole curve К is determined if Pl2, P)3, Р42» P43 are given. On it lies an 
infinite set of point-pairs Pl4, Pn, which are pairs of opposite rotation centers, 
we refer to such a pair as a pair of conjugate points. From (4.6) it follows that 
the intersection of РцРц and P42P43 (supposed to be a finite point) coincides 
with the focus F if u2V\ - Uit>2 = 0, which implies did 2 = d[d2; this means that 
lines P12P42 and P13P43 are parallel and therefore (as their intersection is on K) 
parallel to the asymptote of К (Fig. 58). This gives rise to the following 
general construction (Fig. 59) for conjugate pairs P, P' (once К is known). If P 
on К is given, we determine Si the third intersection of PF and K, S2 that of 
PL and K, then P' is the intersection of LSi and FS2 (L is the point of 1 at 
infinity).

ing (X2 + aX) between these two expressions we obtain the following bilinear 
(and commutative) relation between A and A':

We have considered the curve К in detail because it is an important curve in 
plane kinematics. It is not only the pole curve; we shall meet it again in a 
different context when we deal with “center-points” later in this section.
If the six rotaton centers P4 are given (they must of course satisfy the 
conditions we have set forth in the foregoing), there are four pole triangles, 
PziPmP^, PuPaiPu. PaiPisPia. and P^P^Pm which we denote by T,, T2, T3, T4 
respectively. Three homologous points A2, А», A4 are the reflections of a 
fundamental point, denoted as AT, into the respective.sides of T(. Similar 
configurations exist for Т2,ТЛ,Т4. Hence, there appears a configuration (Fig. 
60) consisting of the six points Pt) and their twelve pertinent joins, four 
fundamental points A T and four homologous points A,. It follows from their 
mutual interdependency that, for instance, A * A * A I are the reflections of A ।

If three positions of E are given, every set of homologous points А ,» A2, Аэ

of £ is such a center. If we consider four positions and prescribe A4 to be on c, 
M must satisfy one condition. Hence there exists a locus of points M in £ 
with this property. In Fig. 61 the circle c and the four points A, on it are drawn 
in X; let Z-AtMAj = a4. The rotation center Ptf is on the perpendicular 
bisector of AtAf, that is the bisector of Z.AJWA,. We have LAjMPn - Ja)2,

seen from M, the optical distance P12P31 is equal to P42PU. The conclusion is 
that the locus of M, called the center-point curve of the four positions, coincides 
with the pole curve K.
Related to the center-point curve in J is the locus in E of the points A 
whose four positions A, are concyclic. It is called the circle-point curve 
(German: Kreispunktkurve). It can be determined by considering the curve К 
for the inverse motion. If A, are concyclic, with center M, we have MA4 = R 
for i = 1,2,3,4; obviously, for the inverse motion the fixed point A and the 
positions Mi of M satisfy AM, = R. This implies that the circle-point curve is 
identical with the center curve of the inverse motion. Hence the pole curve 
KP, the center-point curve KM (both coinciding and lying in S) and the 
circle-point curve KA (in E) are all focal cubics.
To determine KA in the position Ek we use the rotation centers Pj of the 
inverse motion: We know that for three positions, if P12, Р2з, P31 are the 
centers in Z, we obtain those in Et by setting P\2 = Pi2, P« = P31 and P^ as

Pj2 = Pi2> Pit = Pis, Pli4 = Pm, PL, PL and PL are the reflections of PM, 
and P2, into PnPi4, PmPu and Pl2Pn respectively. KA is the locus of points 
with equal optical distance to (for instance) P|2PM and P12PL.
As there is a locus of points A for which the four points A, are concyclic, 
we may expect a finite number of points A for which A, are collinear. In 
Section 3 we found that if AH A2, Ay are on a line I, this line passes through 
the orthocenter of the triangle P23PmPi2, which we denote as H4; conversely 
any line through H4 bears three collinear homologous points. Hence, if H9 is 
the orthocenter of the triangle P24P41P12 the join b = HyH4 is such that four 
homologous points A, lie on b; if Hy and H4 are different points, b is the only 
line with this property. Hence there is in general one point В of E such that B. 
(i = 1,2,3,4) are collinear. It is called the Ball point, being named after R. S. 
Ball who discovered this point (for the instantaneous case); b is called Ball’s 
line.

for the focal cubic). As we mentioned before, in the history of kinematics 
there has been a tendency to apply purely geometric reasoning. We could, on 
the other hand, try to develop a purely analytical theory. It could start by 
defining four positions of the plane E (with coordinates x, у), with respect to 
£ (with coordinates (X, Y)), by means of four displacements each given by 
three pieces of data: (ф„ a„ b,), i = 1,2,3,4; then the four positions of (x, у) in 
2 would be
(4.17)
X. = x cos ф, - у sin Ф, 4- a„
Y, = x sin ф, + у cos ф, + b„ i = l, 2,3,4.
(4.18)
The condition that the homologous points are concyclic is 
(4.18) 
|X?+Y? X, Y, l| = 0.
and this is therefore the equation of the circle-point curve KA. We have 
from (4.17)
(4.19)
X? + Y? = x2 + у2 + 2x (a, cos ф, + b, sin фк)
+ 2y( - a, sin фi + b, cos ф,) + a2 + b?
= x2 + y2-2ax -2b,у + d?,
a, and b, being the characteristics of the inverse displacements and d? = 
a?+b?=d?+6?.
Without any loss of generality we may suppose ф4 = a4 - b4 = 0, which 
means that the frame in 2 and E4 coincide. Then subtracting in (4.18) the 
fourth row from the others it reduces to the 3 x 3 determinant: 
(4.20)
- 2a,x - 2b,y + d*  x(cos</>,-1) x sin ф,
- у sin ф, + a, + у (cos ф, - 1) + b,
= 0,
which shows that KA is a cubic curve. For the third order terms we obtain, 
developing (4.20) with respect to the first column,
(4.21) 
-8£(diX + £.y)sin(l</>2)sin(J</»0sin(J(4>3~ Фг))(х2 + у2)
which shows that KA is a circular cubic. It would cost a great deal of algebra to 
show that (4.20) is a focal curve and to re-derive its other properties. 
Therefore we shall not continue this development any further.
If we want to determine Ball's point B, in E, by this method, use can be 
made of formula (3.2), representing the circle in E which is the locus of the

A2. A., A4; Aj, A4, A r, or A4, A,, A2 are collinear. Ball’s point is the common 
point of the four circles, but the algebra seems cumbersome. Somewhat less 
complicated is the determination of Ball’s line b in 2, the line on which the 
four points B, lie. On it are the orthocenters of the pole triangles T,, T2,T5 and

configuration of four homologous points in X. Special attention was given to 
the quadruple with special properties, such as being concyclic or collinear. We 
now add some remarks about homologous lines.

If I is a line in E and if 1. (i = 1,2,3,4) are its positions in 2 the question 
whether it is possible to determine I such that 1, are concurrent is already 
implicitly solved in the foregoing. Indeed 1 is obviously the Ball line in E for 
the inverse displacements; the common point B' of L is Ball’s point in 2 for 
these displacements.
Example 52. Determine I and В' by means of the formulas (2.5) and (3.5) and compare the results 
with (4.23) and (4.24).
The problem of determining lines in E such that the homologous lines in 2 
are tangent to a circle is not an interesting one; obviously any line in E 
parallel to the Ball line (of the inverse displacements) has this property; the 
center of any such circle is the point B*.
In plane kinematics the study of homologous lines is simpler than that of 
homologous points; this statement will be confirmed when — in the following 
sections — we consider more than four positions. It stems from the fact that 
equations (2.5) are simpler than (2.1). The difference between the behavior of 
points and lines reflects the circumstance that there is no perfect duality in the 
Euclidean plane.
5. Five positions theory
We consider now five positions of the plane E with respect to
Any point A of E has five positions A, (i = 1,2,3,4,5) in 2. The number of 
relative rotation centers P4 is obviously equal to ten.
We cannot expect that there will be (in general) a point A such that the 
points A, are collinear because we have seen that for four positions there is 
only one point (Ball’s point) such that Aj,A2, Аэ, A4 are collinear. More 
promising is the problem to determine A such that the five points A, are 
concyclic.
We give first a geometric solution. The locus of A, such that A h A2, Аэ, A4 
are concyclic has been derived in Section 4 and seen to be a cubic curve 
(which we denoted by KA) passing through the isotropic points ft, I2 and 
through the centers Р>2, Р», PMt PL, PL
*
 PL. Analogously the locus of Ai 
such that Ai, A3, Ai, As are concyclic is obtained by replacing position 4 with 
position 5. The resulting circle-point curve which we denote by KAjXM passes 
through /„ I2 and Pilt P13, PJ5* PL, PL, PL. The two circular cubics, KA and 
KA|W have nine intersections; among these are Л, I2 and PL, Рл, Pin the 
remaining four denoted by В1 (j « 1,2,3,4) are the solutions of our problem.

Example 53. Show that the five points h, /a, PL. Pj». Pu must indeed be rejected and that only 
the B1 satisfy the condition that their five homologous positions are coneyclie.
The four points В ‘ are called the Burnt ester points of the five positions, in 
honor of the man who was the first to solve the problem (Burmester [1876; 
1877; 1888, pp. 621-23]). It can be shown by examples that they may be all 
real, two may be imaginary or all four may be imaginary.
The five positions of a Burmester point ВI (i - 1,...»5) are on a circle, the 
center of which we denote by M1. There are four such Burmester centers. 
These are located at the non-trivial intersections of the two center-point 
curves KM and KM(2>S. It is easy to see that these four points of S are also the 
Burmester points of the inverse displacements, and that they may also be 
found as the non-trivial intersections of two circle-point curves, each related 
to four positions of the inverse displacements. A pair B\Mf is called a 
Burmester pair.
Several special cases arise if the five positions satisfy certain conditions. 
Apart from being real or imaginary, one or more points or centers may be at 
infinity.
The determination of the points B1 (or M') as intersections of two cubic 
curves is not an attractive operation. Some easier processes for finding them 
come from the fact that the Burmester points can be determined as the 
intersections of two conics. Analytically, this reduces the problem to deter­
mining the roots of an equation of degree four (rather than nine).
One such method (Hackmuller (1938a, b], Veldkamp [1963] makes use of 
the equation of the focal curve, thus following Burmester’s argument. The 
pole curve (or the center-point curve, identical to it) for the positions 1, 2, 3, 4 
is given by (4.2):
(5.1) 
К « KM » Li2Cm- LmCi2 = 0,
in which and Cw are defined by (4.1).
Ll2 = 0 is the equation of the line Pi2PJb and C,2 = 0 that of the circle with 
Pi2P3i as diameter; LM = 0 is the line P^Pu and Cu » 0 the circle with P42PM 
as diameter. We write (5.1) as
(5.2) 
KM » mZLI2 - (LM - Li2)Ci2 = 0,
with ntZ = Сэ4“С|2. In view of (4.1) we have: nt = 0 is the equation of the 
power line (the common chord) of the circles C»2 and CM; Z = 0 is the line at 
infinity. The center-point curve of the positions 1, 2, 3, 5 is obtained from (5.2) 
if we replace the subscript 4 with 5:

where m'Z -Cys-Cn. The curves KM and KM|2„ both pass through the 
isotropic points and through P2J, P3H Pt2. The former lie on Cl2 = 0, and on 
Z = 0; furthermore P3i, Pu lie on Lu = 0 and on Си = 0- Hence if we 
eliminate ZLi2 and CI2 from (5.2) and (5.3) (which are linear homogeneous 
equations for these expressions) we obtain a relation which is satisfied by P23 
and the four Burmester centers M’. The result of the elimination is
(5.4) 
m (Lu — Lu) ~ m '(Lm ~ Li2) = 0,
which represents a conic, passing through these five points. But, obviously, we 
may derive all together ten such conics, each passing through the four points 
M' and one of the rotation centers P4. Two of them are sufficient to determine 
the Burmester centers; these are found therefore as the intersections of two 
conics, the equations of which can be derived if the configuration of the PQ is 
given.
A more primitive and direct method to determine the Burmester points is 
the following (Bottema [1964a]) which uses neither the centers P4 nor the 
properties of focal curves. If we describe the five positions of the moving 
plane E using the parameters (</>„ ahbt) (i = 1,2,3,4,5), the five homologous 
points B,(Xt, Yi) in I of a point B(x,y) in E are given by:
X, = x cos ф, - у sin ф, + a,,
(5
*5)
 
Y, - x sin ф, 4- у cos ф, + b„ (i = 1,2,3,4,5).
A circle C in S has the equation
(5.6) 
c^X2+ Уа)-2с,Х-2с2У + с3 = 0.
The point B, is on the circle C if (5.5) satisfy equation (5.6); we substitute (5.5) 
into (5.6) and obtain the five relations (i = 1,2,3,4,5):
ctt(xa + у2) + c^a 2+ b2,) + 2cnx(at cos ф, + b, sin ф,)
(5.7) 
+ 2c<»y( - a, sin <£, + b, соьф.) - 2a,Ci - 26,c2-2(ciX + c2y)cos<fr
+ 2(Ciy -c2x)sin<ft + c3 = 0.
These are five equations for the five unknowns: x, у and the ratios of

If we subtract it from any of the four others the unknown c> is eliminated. The 
homogeneous coordinates of the center M of the circle C are (ct, c2, c0); we do 
not exclude the case c0 = 0. Analogously we introduce homogeneous coordi­
nates (x, y, z) for В in E. Furthermore we set
(5.9) 
a, cos ф, + bt sin </>, = -4 and - a, sin ф, + b, cos ф, = - 6,.
The four equations obtained by subtracting (5.8) from (5.7) are (i = 2,3,4,5): 
i(a? + bi)cnz - a,cnx - btcny - a,c,z - b,c2z
(510) 
+ (1 - COS ф.)(С1Х 4- C2y) + sin ф|(С|У - c2x) = 0.
These are four equations for the coordinates (x, y, z) of Burmester point В in 
E and the coordinates (cb c2, c0) of the corresponding Burmester center M in 
X. The symmetry of the equation is obvious: if E and 1 are interchanged, and 
thus (x,y,z) and (Ci,c2,Co)» (ohM,) and (а^Ьь-ф,), the equations are 
invariant. The set (5.10) determines the Burmester pairs of the five positions.
In order to solve the system (5.10) we introduce the seven unknowns
Mu = CoZ, Ml = C|Z, U2 = C2Z, Uj = C<iX, 
(5.11)
U4 = C(»y, U$ = C|X + c2y, UA = c,y - c2x,
satisfying the two quadratic relations
(5.12) 
u»Us = UiU-» + u2u4, UoUA= U|U4- u2u5,
both of which are independent of the displacement parameters. The equa­
tions (5.10) are now (i = 2,3,4,5):
2(u?+ b2,)u0- atUi - b,u2- a,uy- b,u<
+ (1 “ cos$,)u5 + (sin ф,)иь = 0,
but these are linear equations for u,. Hence we have obtained six homogene­
ous equations for the seven homogeneous unknowns u,; four of these 
equations are linear and two are quadratic. The number of solutions is 
therefore indeed four. If the equations are solved it follows from (5.11) that 
В = (u.b u4, un) and M = (и,, u2, u0). Hence by this procedure we obtain the 
Burmester points and the Burmester centers simultaneously. The method is 
suitable for numerical computation if the positions are given by the param­
eters (a„ b„ ф,).
We now discuss some aspects of the set of equations (5.12) and (5.13). If the

is unequal to zero, we can solve (5.13) for u(, u2t u^ uh as linear functions of 
u0, u5, u4. Substituting these into (5.12) gives us two quadratic equations for 
the coordinates x,y, z of the Burmester points, which are in this way 
determined as intersections of two conics. The result cannot be that cn = 0, 
because this implies un =

*
 A = 0. The conclusion is:
if Д/0 the four Burmester centers are all finite points. Analogously, if
(5.15) 
Д' = |а, 6, l-cos</>, sin </>, |
is unequal to zero, we have z / 0 which implies that the four Burmester points 
are finite points. Hence ДД' X 0 gives us the condition that all Burmester pairs 
consist of finite points. If, however, Д = 0, Д'^0 the Burmester points are 
finite points, but for (at least) one of them the corresponding center is at 
infinity, which means that for that Burmester point the five homologous 
positions are collinear. This special Burmester point is called in Veldkamp’s 
terminology (Veldkamp [1963]) a Ball’s point with excess one. The relation 
Д = 0 has another consequence. It implies that there exist four coefficients A„ 
not all zero, such that
(5.16) 
2 A«a< = 2 A^. = S M1 “ cos<M = A< ф, = 0.
When these conditions apply, multiplying (5.13) by M and summing the 
resulting equations yields:
(5.17) 
!мпХ А-(Д? + Ь?)- u, V - u4 У АЛ = 0,
but this represents a straight line in E satisfied by the remaining Burmester 
points (for which c0 is in general unequal to zero). Hence the theorem: if one 
of the four Burmester points В1 has its corresponding center at infinity, the other 
three B\ B\ B4 are collinear (Primrose et al. [1964]). It has also been shown 
that if В1 is on the line through the other three, it coincides with one of them. 
These latter two theorems may be regarded as generalizations of ones due to 
R. Muller (Muller [1892]) for the instantaneous case.
The Burmester point configuration because of its applicability to the design 
of four-bar linkages is the most developed aspect of the theory of five 
homologous points. In the literature some other problems have been investi­
gated: A conic is determined by five of its points, hence any five homologous 
points determine a conic. One may ask when this conic is a parabola. It has 
been shown (Sandor and Freudenstejn [1967], Freudenstein et al. [1969]) 
that the locus, of points in E such that their five positions in 2 are points of a

parabola, is a curve of degree twelve, with six-fold points at h and /2. and 
passing through the five Ball points related to the five different combinations 
of four positions. This answer shows that the problem is complicated. We 
remark that a parabola is not uniquely determined by four points. In fact two 
parabolas pass through them and these are either real or imaginary.
On the other hand, as a parabola is uniquely determined by four tangents, it 
seems more promising to ask for (he locus of lines in E such that their five 
homologous positions in 1 are tangent to a parabola. We shall show that the 
answer is relatively simple (Bottema [1970]).
A curve of the second class, in У, is given by a quadratic equation of the line 
coordinates I7b Ui, U%. If it is a parabola this equation is satisfied by the line 
at infinity, that is by (0,0,1). Hence the general equation of a parabola reads
(5.18) 
a„l7j + 2a12LfIl72 + a22(J? + 2ai5l/,(7.i + 2an(/2(/, = 0.
Therefore five lines (Ui„ (72„ 17

is equal to zero, which may be written as
(5.19) 
D»| (JL+l/L U2„-U22, 2U„U2i U„Uy, U2,U,,\ = 0.
As U,„ U2„ Uy, are linear functions of u,. u2, u. this equation is of the tenth
degree. It can, however, be considerably simplified. It follows from (2.5) that
U2, + U2= u2+u2.

SIX AND MORI POSITIONS

Developing (5.19) by means of the minors of the last two columns shows D 
has (u; 4 и 2)*  as a factor. Removing this factor we are left with the equation

(5 
4 bnu2 4 Ut)(a^Ui 4- b„u2 4- u3)] = 0,
S being the sum of 10 terms. As (5.23) is of the second degree, the locus of the 
lines in E such that their five positions in £ are tangents of a parabola is a 
conic, which we denote by Al.
We know that there is one line in E such that its four homologous positions 
in £ pass through one point. Let I be this Ball line for the four positions 1, 2, 
3, 4; hence I», L, h, L pass through one point B, h has an arbitrary position. 
Any conic with I, (i = 1,...,5) as tangents is degenerated into the pencil of 
lines with vertex В and a second pencil with its vertex on l5. Among all such 
conics there is one parabola: obtained if the vertex on L is taken as its point at 
infinity. Therefore the line I belongs to the locus Al. The conclusion is: the Ball 
line of any four, out of the five, positions is a tangent of Al. Or, in other words, 
the locus Al is that conic determined by the five Ball lines in E, each such line 
is related to four of the five given positions.
There are of course many special cases.
Example 54. If. for instance, Ф, = ф2 show that M is degenerate.
Example 55. If two (and therefore all five) Ball lines coincide, show that M is degenerate.
6. Six and more positions
We make some remarks about six and more positions of E with respect 
to £.
In the case of six positions there are obviously 15 relative rotation centers 
P„ and 15 Ball points BifU (one for every group of four positions out of the six).
A natural problem is to determine the locus of points A in E such that At 
(i = 1,...,6) in £ are on a conic. This is the case if the 6x6 determinant
(6.1) 
|X? X,Y. Y? X, Y, 1|
is equal to zero. As X(, Y, are linear functions of x, y, the degree of the locus 
is — at first sight — equal to eight. But (6.1) may be written as
(6.2) 
|X?4-Y? X.Y Y? X Y, 1|
and X?4- Y?« x2 4- у2 4- linear terms. Hence, if we factor out (x2 4 y2), the 
terms of the highest degree are given by a determinant with two equal

columns, the first and the last. This implies that the eight ordei terms vanish. 
Further analysis (Freudenstein et al. [1969]) shows that the degree of the 
locus is in general seven; it has three-fold points at h and /2 and passes 
through the 15 centers and the 15 Ball points.
By counting the intersections of this curve with the curve of twelfth order 
described in Section 5 (i.e., the locus of co-parabolic points for five positions), 
the number of points in E whose six positions in 1 are on a parabola has been 
calculated to be 33 (Freudenstein, et al. [1969]). A much simpler problem is 
that of determining the lines in E with six homologous positions tangent to a 
parabola. They are, in view of the results of Section 5, the common tangents 
of two conics. Each of these conics is in turn tangent to one set of five Ball 
lines, each set is composed of the Ball lines corresponding to all combinations 
of four positions out of a given five. Hence, two such sets follow for instance 
from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. In this case then, one of the four common 
tangents to the two conics is obviously the Ball line associated with the 
positions 1, 2, 3. 4. This line is spurious since its positions 1, 2, 3, 4 do not 
define a unique parabola and therefore its 5th and 6th position will generally 
be tangent to different parabolas. Hence there are generally only three lines 
with the property we seek (Bottema [1970]).
For six positions, the six homologous lines (l/u, U2i, Um), i = 1,.. .,6, of the 
line (ui, u2, Uy) in E, will be tangent to a conic if their coordinates satisfy the 
condition
(6.3) 
D'^|U?( + U22i Ul-Ui 2UuU2i UltU3t U2IUm Щ| = 0.
D' being a 6 x 6 determinant. This is at first sight an equation of degree twelve

where we have made use of (5.22). Developing (6.3) with respect to the minors 
of the last three columns and making use of (5.21) it is seen that D' has the 
factor (w?+u2)4. This implies that the locus of the lines of E whose six 
homologous lines in 2 are tangent to a conic is a curve of the fourth class. 
If 1 is the Ball line of the positions 1, 2, 3, 4 then lIt 12, l3, L pass through one

point В; obviously the six lines I, are tangents of a conic degenerated into two 
pencils, one with vertex B. the other with the intersection of h and lft as its 
vertex. This implies that all 15 Ball lines of the six positions are tangent of M4.
If we consider seven positions we may use for instance the two curves 
.44(1,2,3,4.5,6) and M4(l,2.3,4.5.7); they have sixteen common tangents 
among these are, however, the five Ball lines related to the common positions 
1,...,5. Hence the number of lines in E whose seven homologous lines in JS 
are tangents of a conic is equal to eleven (Bottema [1970], where, however, 
some results must be corrected).
7. Continuous displacements
The fundamental equations of plane kinematics are (2.1):
X = x cos ф - у sin ф + a,
Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + b.
These give the position (X. Y), in the fixed plane 2. of the point (x. у) of the 
moving plane E. A displacement is described by the three numbers ф, a and 
b. In the preceding sections we have dealt with sets of discrete displacements. 
We consider now a continuous set of displacements; it is described if </>, a, b 
are given functions of a parameter t. If t is the time (7.1) defines a motion of E 
with respect to 1. Any motion is completely described by the three functions 
</>(/), a(t) and b(t). They give us, by means of (7.1), not only the position of 
any point of E at any time, but also its velocity, its acceleration, and so on. If, 
for instance, we take constant values for x, у the relations (7.1) are a 
parametric representation of the path of the point (x, y).
In Chapter II, Section 6 we have distinguished between geometric and 
time-dependent kinematics. For the latter the parameter t has an essential 
significance; the velocity and acceleration distribution for instance belong to 
this subject. Many other properties of the motion are independent of the 
choice of the parameter and deal with its geometric aspects only: for example 
the paths, the centrodes and so on. In this and the next section we consider 
geometric kinematics.
If ф is a constant any displacement of the set is a translation. The motion is 
a simple one. Any line is displaced into a parallel line. The paths of the points 
of E are congruent curves. The path of one point may be chosen arbitrarily 
and then the motion is completely known. We shall disregard this special case

and suppose that ф is variable. Then we may take it as the motion’s 
parameter, a natural one, having a geometric meaning. In this case we have
X = x cos ф - у sin ф + а (Ф),
Y = x sin ф 4- у cos ф 4- Ь(ф).
and the motion is completely defined by the two functions а(ф) and Ь(ф). Al! 
properties depend on these two only. Differentiation with respect to ф will be 
denoted by a prime. The “geometric velocity” of the point x, у is
(7.3) 
X' = - x sin ф - у cos ф 4- a\ Y' = x cosф - у sin ф 4- 6'.
If ф depends on the time t we have X = Х'ф> Y = У'ф, hence at any moment 
the ratio of the velocity and the geometric velocity is the same for all points. 
In particular, if X'= У' = 0 for a certain point, then this point is at rest, 
independent of the time scale according to which the motion takes place. 
Hence the instantaneous rotation center (or the pole) of the motion is a 
geometric concept. It may be defined as the point which at the moment under 
consideration is at a cusp of its path. X' = Y' = 0 are two linear equations for 
x, y, and the coordinates of the pole P are
(7.4) 
xp = a  sin ф - b'cos<£, yp = a'cos ф 4- 6  sin ф
*
*
By means of (7.2) we have for its coordinates in S:
(7.5) 
Xp = a - b\ Yp = a'+b.
As (7.4) and (7.5) hold for any value of ф this implies that (7.4) is a parametric 
representation of the locus of all points in E which at some position Ф 
coincide with the pole P, that is, the moving centrode pm; (7.5) represents the 
fixed centrode pf. At any moment they have P as a common point. The 
derivative of (7.4) is
xp= (a'~ b")cos ф 4- (a
*
 4- b')sin ф,
yp- - (л' - b")sin ф 4-(a" 4-h')cos ф.
which gives us the components of the geometric velocity along pm. (This is the 
geometric rate at which the contact point P between pm and pr moves along 
pm, and is not the velocity of any one physical point.) This velocity has with 
respect to ОКУ the components

but these are, as can be seen by taking the first derivative of (7.5), the 
components of the change of contact along pt. Hence the rate of change of

contact along pm is the same (in direction and magnitude) as its change along 
pr. This implies two statements: at any moment pm and p, are tangent at P, and 
furthermore the two curves have the same arc element and hence the same 
arc length between corresponding positions. The arc element s' on both pm 
and pf is given by
(7.8) 
(s')2 = (a'-h7 + (a’’+^')2.
The relation between pm and p( can obviously be described as follows: the 
moving centrode rolls without sliding along the fixed centrode.
We have in particular: p< is the envelope of the set of congruent curves pm 
generated by the motion of E with respect to
Let 7 be an arbitrary curve in E. During the motion it has a set of positions 
with respect to this set has in general an envelope in £. Let Г be this 
envelope and А (ф) the tangent point of 7 and Г at the position ф. This point 
of contact changes so that as the motion proceeds А(ф) corresponds to 
different points along 7 and along Г. Suppose that Х(ф), У(ф) is its position 
in S, х(ф), у(Ф) its position in E. This implies that X = Х(ф), Y = У(ф) is a 
parametric representation of Г and x = x (ф), у = у (ф) is one of 7. For any ф 
the two curves are tangent at A. Obviously we have
Х(ф) = х(ф)со$ф - у(ф)$т ф + а,
У(ф) = х(ф)sin ф + у(ф)со$ ф + h.
The geometric velocity v of the change in position of A along 7 has in the 
frame the components
(710) 
х'(ф), У'(Ф).
The velocity V of the position of A along Г has in the frame OXY the 
components following from (7.9):
X' = х'соьф - x sin ф - у'sin ф - у сояф + a\
Y' = x'sin ф + x cos ф + у'cos ф - у sin ф + Ь'.
The components of this velocity with respect to the oiy frame are
Х'со5ф + Y'sin ф = x' - у + а'соьф + b'sin ф, 
(7.11) 
- X'sin ф + Y'соьф = x + у' - a'sin ф + Ь'соьф.
But, as 7 and Г are tangent at A, the direction of the two velocities v and V 
must be the same. Let V ~ !(ф)и, !(Ф) being the ratio of the velocities of A 
on Г and on 7 respectively (German: Rollgleitzahl) then from (7.10) and (7.11) 
it follows

Comparing this with (7.4) we conclude that (С|/(2тг)), (с2/(2тг)) are the

The subject of this section has been continuous kinematics; especially the 
last problem, dealing with a complete motion, belongs to what may be called 
“kinematics in the large”. As we mentioned before this is a rather restricted 
field of research. Another problem which could be inserted here is that of 
determining the characteristics (such as order and circularity in the case that 
these are algebraic curves) of the path of an arbitrary point if the paths of two 
points of E are given; this would lead to some formulas originally given by 
S. Roberts. We will put this off to Chapter IX. In the course of its history 
continuous (plane) kinematics has been developed mainly as the study of 
instantaneous properties (to be dealt with in the next section) or as the study 
of special motions, to be treated in Chapter IX.
8. Instantaneous geometric kinematics
This section deals with instantaneous geometric plane kinematics. Which is 
the study, for a certain instant during a continuous motion, of the differential 
geometric properties. So if we are interested in, for instance, the path of a 
point we study its tangent, its curvature, and so on. The best way to deal with 
this subject analytically is, as we did in the general spatial case, to introduce 
canonical coordinate systems and to make use of the concept of instantaneous 
invariants. The circumstances of the motion being restricted to a plane 
simplifies considerably the general theory. We could specialize the results 
derived in Chapter II, but we prefer to develop the planar case here 
autonomously.
One of the most important features of plane motion is the property that the 
angular velocity has a fixed direction (viz. perpendicular to the plane) and 
thereby essentially loses its vectorial character. In this respect plane kinema­
tics is at the end of a chain: in n-dimensional space the angular velocity could 
be represented by a skew n x n matrix; for n > 3 this is essentially a tensor, 
for n == 3 it is equivalent to a vector, for n = 2 it may be considered as a scalar. 
This implies that we are able to normalize with respect to angular velocity and 
introduce as a natural parameter for the motion (provided it is not a 
translation) the rotation angle ф. This is also a reason why planar kinematics 
is more simple than spherical kinematics where no single parameter describes 
the angular velocity (although in planar motion we do lose the attractive 
complete duality that exists for spherical motions).

As we know already, any plane, time-independent, motion may be de­
scribed by the equations
(8.1) X = x cos ф — у sin ф + д (</>), Y — x sin ф + у cos ф + Ь(Ф),
that is by the two functions а(ф) and Ь(ф). If we consider only one position of 
the moving plane £(x, y) with respect to J(X, У) we may without loss of 
generality suppose that it is given by ф = 0 and that а(ф) and Ь(ф) are given 
by the power series

If the frames are chosen such that they coincide in the “zero-posit ion” we 
have from (8.1) and (8.2)
(8.3) 
a<, = b„ = 0.
In addition we place the common origin of the frames at the pole at the 
moment Ф = 0. In view of (7.5) (or (7.4)) this implies
(8.4) ai = /,, = 0.
Furthermore the axes Ox and o« are chosen along the common tangent (at 
the pole) of the centrodes. From (7.7) (or (7.6)) it follows
(8.5) a2 = 0.
The two frames are now specified except for the sense of the positive X-axis. 
If we change this sense then b2 changes its sign. Assuming that b2 / 0 we make 
a choice by taking the direction in such a way that
(8.6) b2 > 0.
The coinciding frames Oxy and ояу defined by (8.3)-(8.6) will be called 
canonical; they are the systems with respect to which we shall study 
instantaneous kinematics. Our choice is a natural one: the pole and the 
pole-tangent have a simple geometrical meaning. That we take the X-axis 
along the latter (and not the У-axis) and the inequality (8.6) are mere 
conventions. The introduction of this canonical frame fails in two exceptional 
cases: if the pole is at infinity it cannot be taken as the origin, if b2 = 0 the 
sense of the axes is not determined. We return to these special cases later on 
and exclude them for the time being.
If we let X„, Y„ denote the nth derivative of X, У (with respect to </>) 
evaluated at ф = 0 and measured in the canonical system, from (8.1) it follows

the higher derivatives we remark that

Example 63. In Chapter 11. (6.3) formulas for the derivatives up to the third have been given in 
the spatial case. Show that they can be reduced to (8.7) for planar kinematics if we take г « 0 and 
де ■ b2. Technically this case is excluded (see statement following Chapter 11. (5.2)). but since 
Chapter II, (5.5) simply states that d_- is arbitrary in this case. d? could be appropriately redefined 
in Chapter II, (5.6) for this case.
From (8.7) it follows that up to the nth order, the instantaneous properties 
of the motion depend on the constants a4,..., an and b2, bt,..., bn. These 
are the instantaneous invariants. Any relation between them reflects a special 
geometric aspect of a particular motion.
From (8.1) it follows that the inverse motion is given by
x = X cos Ф + Y sin ф - a cos ф - b sin </>.
(8 8)
' * ' 
у = - X sin ф + Y cos ф 4- a sin ф - b cos ф.
The rotation angle of this motion is - Ф (with the positive sense of ф from Ox 
towards Ov) which is measured in the sense of Ox towards Ov. the 
opposite direction of Oy. We introduce new frames such that X = X, 
Y = - Y, x = x. у = - y, that means: we reflect the canonical coordinate 
systems into the pole-tangent. Then we obtain for (8.8)
(8.9) 
x = X cos ф - Y sin ф 4- а, у = X sin ф 4- Y cos ф + b, 
with
(8.10) 
a - - a cos ф - b sin Ф, b = - a sin ф 4- b cos ф.

If we want to study instantaneous properties up to the nth order we need 
the tables (8.7) and (8.15) up to the (n + l)th column. This implies that for 
n = 1 there appear no invariants at all, for n = 2 there is one, for n > 2 the 
number is 1 + 2(n - 2) = 2n - 3.
Instantaneous kinematics of the nth order is a special case (the “infinitesi­
mal case”) of finite (n + Impositions theory. It is more simple because the 
latter deals with (essentially) 3n parameters. Some work has been done on 
mixed problems, considering n positions of which certain positions are 
coinciding, i.e., infinitesimally separated (DizioOlu (1967], Tesar (1967,

1968], Tesar and Sparks [1968]). Instantaneous kinematics for л = 1 is trivial; 
because no invariant appears, we conclude that up to the first order all planar 
motions are essentially the same. Since all first order properties relative to the 
pole are the same, all systems which are placed so that their poles coincide are 
congruent up to the first order.
Example 68. 
Prove from (8.7) that the tangent to the path of a point P is perpendicular to the 
radius vector OP.
Example 69. 
Prove from (8.15) that the intersection of a moving line I and its consecutive line 
(that is the point at which I is tangent to its envelope) coincides with the projection of О on I.
In the following sections we consider instantaneous kinematics of the nth 
order for small values of n > 1. There is of course a clear parallelism between 
these results and those we found for finite positions theory (Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 
of this chapter).
9. Second order properties
For n = 2 we have from (8.7)
X<> = x, X, = - y, X2 = - x,
Y„=y, Yt = x, Y2=-y + b2,
which implies that the situation depends on one number. b2, defined to be 
positive.
In the general case the moving centrode is given by (7.4) and the fixed 
centrode by (7.5). From either of these it follows that the (geometric) velocity 
at which the contact changes along the centrodes has, in our canonical system, 
the components (-b2,0); which gives us a geometric meaning for the 
invariant b2. (The centrode contact moves therefore in the direction of the 
negative X-axis, which is the reason why Veldkamp in his thesis (Veldkamp 
[1963]) introduced a canonical frame with the X-axis in the opposite sense to 
ours.)
The curvature к of the path of a point A(x, y), at the zero-position, 
is given by the well-known formula from elementary calculus: к = 
(X1Y2-X2Y,)/(X?4- У2)* 2. Substituting from (9.1) it follows that
(9.2) 
к = (x2 + у2 - b2y )/(x2 + у
which is valid for any point different from the pole. If x —>0, у -♦() we obtain 
к —♦ » in accordance with the fact that the moving point coinciding with О

passes through a cusp of its path. From (9.2) it follows that the locus of the 
points which are at an inflection point of their path is given by
(9.3) 
x2+y2-b2y =0.
The inflection curve is therefore the circle with center (0, b2/2) and diameter b2.
It is tangent to the X-axis at О (Fig. 64), and is called the inflection circle.
If we introduce polar coordinates (r, 0) (0 c 6 < rr, - » < r < «)• with Ox 
as axis, we have x « r cos0, у = r sin 0. For (9.2) we obtain (if r/0)
(9.4) 
к = (r - 62sin Q)!r2.
The radius of curvature p is the reciprocal of the curvature, therefore p = к 
If M is the center of curvature related to A (r,0), then M is on the path 
normal О A and therefore M(r, 0) with f = r - p. Then we obtain from (9.4):
(9.5) 
((1/r) — (l/r))sin 0 = l/b2,
•The sign convention here is that в is measured counterclockwise from the positive Ox axis to 
the line connecting (x.y) to the origin, extended if necessary into the upper-half plane, r is 
positive if the point (x, y) is in the upper-half plane and negative if it is in the lower-half.

the (first) Euler-Savary equation. (The same sign convention is used for r as 
for r.)
Example 70. Verify from (9.5) that A is on the inflection circle if f •= «.
We can write (9.5) as
(9.6) 
b2(r - r)sin 0 = rr,
hence for a fixed value of 0 (sin 0/0) there exists a bi-linear relation between 
r and f. Every point M belongs to one point A. If A is on the X-axis, 
different from O, we have sin 6 = 0, r/0 and therefore r = 0: any point on 
the pole tangent has its center of curvature at the pole. We can even define 
the point M if A tends to infinity; for r we obtain r = - b2sin 6 which 
means that M is on the circle which is the reflection of the inflection circle into 
Ox. This circle is called the cuspidal (or return) circle and we shall meet it 
soon in another context.
Example 71. 
Show that all points in E with the same magnitude radius of curvature, |p |, lie on 
the sixth order tri-circular curve (xJ + у’)'- p3(
3 + у3 ~ Ь2уУ « 0 and that their corresponding 
centers lie on (№ + УУ~р’(№ + Y2 + b3YY = 0. (These arc known as the p and pm-curves 
respectively. They have been studied by Alt (1932a, b|.)
*
Example 72. 
Use the preceding Example io deduce that the locus of all points which have the 
same path curvature in two finitely separated positions of their motion is a plane curve, imbedded 
in E, and that for three separated positions there are only a finite number of points with the same 
path curvature in all three positions. (Idem.)
If A is on the inflection circle, the inflection tangent of its path is 
perpendicular to О A and it passes therefore through the point H = (0,62), 
called the inflection pole. For H itself, the path tangent is the tangent to the 
inflection circle. The cuspidal tangent at О passes also through H (see 
Example 60).
Our configuration is the limit case of three finitely separated positions: All 
three vertices Ptf of the pole triangle coincide with О and the three sides with 
Ox. The cuspidal circle is the limit of the circumcircle of the pole triangle, and 
the inflection pole is the limit of its orthocenter. The inflection circle is the 
limit of the circumcircles of the image pole triangles. The fundamental point 
of the three homologous positions Ah now coinciding at one point A, is the 
reflection A • of A into Ox. The isogonal relation of the general three 
positions theory tends to that between A * and M.
If the pole О and the pole tangent Ox are known, and if we know 
moreover the center of curvature M(F, 6) of any point A(r, 0), r/ F the 
invariant b2 is determined by equation (9.6), and therefore the center of

There is an interesting sequel to the last statement. Suppose that two points 
A, and A2 and their centers of curvature Mi and M2 are given, and nothing 
more. Supposing that the lines M}A} and M2A2 are neither coincident nor 
parallel, their intersection is obviously the pole O. We try to determine the 
pole tangent Ox. For the time being we introduce an Ox -axis along the inner 
bisector of the angle A{OA2 (Fig. 65). Let Z.A,Ox = ZOX A2 = a, and 
Z.OX Ox =/3, as yet unknown. Then А> = (-гь 0,), Mt = ( - rit 0,), A2 = 
(r2, 02), M2 = (r2, 02) with 0i = n - (3 + «X 02 = a ~ /3. Applying (9.6) to the 
two pairs Ai, Mt and A2,M2 we obtain after eliminating b2:

S2 = r2f2(rt - n), Si =

From (9.7) it follows
(9.9) 
tan p = ((S. + S2)/(S, - S2))tan a,
which implies that the pole tangent has been determined. Moreover b2 may 
now be calculated from (9.6) and the orientation of Ox chosen in such a way 
that b2 >0. The conclusion is: if two points A, and their centers of curvature 
Mt are known, the second order configuration is completely determined. This 
means, in particular, that we now know (at ф = 0) the center of curvature of 
the path of any point.
Our Fig. 65 has an elegant geometrical property: With respect to the 
Cartesian frame Ox we have
A । = (fj cos a, - r, sin a ), 
My = (r । cos a, - fi sin a),
A2 = (r2cosa, fjsin a), 
M2 = (r2cosa, r2sina).
Hence the equations of lines AtA2 and MyM2 are respectively
(r, + n)(sin a)x + (fi - r2)(cosa)y - 2r,r2sina cos a = 0,
(fi + fj)(sin a)x + (r, - f2)(cosa)y - 2f|f2sin a cos a = 0.
For the coordinates of their intersection T we obtain
x : у = [nr2(ri - f2)- г,г2(гу - r2)]cosa : [r^r, + r2)“ Г|Г2(п + n))sina
= [ - rtfi(f2- r2)+ r2f2(f, - fi)]cosa : [r.r,(r2 - r2) + r2f2(ft - r,)]sina
= ( - St 4- S2)cos a : (Si 4- S2)sin a.
Hence, if Z.OX T = /3, we have, in view of (9.9)
(9.10) 
tan p « ((Si 4- S2)/( - St 4- S2))tan a = - tan p.
The pole tangent Ox and the line ОТ are therefore one another’s reflection 
into the bisector Ox; in other words, Ox and ОТ are isogonally conjugate 
with respect to the angle AyOA2. This is Bobillier’s theorem (Bobillier 
[1870]).

Consider (he case when A,A2 and M,M2 are parallel.

If AM and A2M2 have a point of intersection it coincides with the pole. If

to determine the pole О in the case when the two lines coincide: Let 6 be an 
arbitrary point on the line, OAt = p„ OM, = m,. Then it follows, by applying 
(9.6) twice, eliminating b2 and putting OO = z, provided sin 0/0:
(m»“pi)(z + p2)(z + m2)-(m2- p2)(z + p>)(z + m.) = 0,

after some algebra.
(9.12) 
D = (pi-p2)(m,- m2)(p, - m,)(p2- m2).
All this leads to two noteworthy conclusions: If the four points A.. M, (i = 1,2) 
are not collinear they may be taken arbitrarily and they determine a motion (to 
the second order) completely and uniquely. If they are on one line, however, 
they must be such that D >0, and if so there are two possible poles.
It is clear that when they are collinear the sign of D depends on the order of 
the four points on their line. There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the points, but 
D does not change its sign for a cyclical transformation of the quadruple, nor 
if we take the inverse orientation on the line. (The order (1,2,3,4) gives the 
same sign as (2,3,4,1) and as (4,3,2,1).) Hence there are only three different 
“projective” orders of the four points, represented for instance by 
(A., 
A2, M2), (Ai, A2, Mt, M2) and (A t, A2. M2, M,). It is easy to verify
that the first and second give D > 0 and the third D < 0. This implies that the 
condition for the collinear points is: the pairs A\M2 and A2Mi do not separate 
one another.
O' was an arbitrary chosen point; if we take it al the midpoint of A rM2 we 
have pi + m2 = 0 and (9.11) reads
(9.13) 
(m, + p2)z2 + 2(m tp2 - m2pi)z + (m, + p2)pi = 0.
Hence for + p2/0 the two roots satisfy ZjZ2 = pJ, which means that the 
two possible poles O} and O2 are located so that (OOi)(OO2) = (OA})2 = 
(OM2)2. The conclusion is: Ot and O2 are harmonic with A( and M2 and 
therefore with A2 and Mi as well.

We know that the geometric velocity of contact along the centrode, u, is equal 
in magnitude to - b2. In Fig. 66 the component OO of и along the line 
perpendicular to О A is drawn, and also A A = О A = r which is the geometric 
velocity of A. As OO = 62sin0, it follows from (9.14) that the center of 
curvature M related to A is the intersection of OA and OA. This is 
Hartmann’s theorem (Hartmann (1893]). As О is the same for any point on 
OA it facilitates the construction of centers of curvature.

lines through H is a circle ё, the reflection into Ox of the inflection circle. If 
three consecutive lines pass through one point A, this point is a cusp of the 
envelope of the moving line (a cusp being the dual counterpart of an inflection 
point). Hence c is the locus of the cusps of the envelopes of moving lines and 
it is therefore called the cuspidal circle of the instantaneous position.

If in three finite positions theory I is a line for which the homologous 
positions lb b, Is pass through one point A, and if I is parallel to I, then A has 
equal distances to T,, T2, L and it is therefore the center of a circle tangent to 
these three lines. For the instantaneous case we obtain: if T is any line in the 
moving plane, it is tangent to its envelope ё at the projection, A, of О onto T, 
and the center M of curvature of ё at A is on the cuspidal circle с; M is the

This statement about the curvature of the envelope of a straight line is a 
special case of a general theorem, dealing with the curvature of the envelope 
of an arbitrary curve in E. It was proved by means of a more-or-Iess 
“geometric” argument. We shall give an analytic proof making use of the idea 
developed in Section 7, dealing with tangency between contacting curves.
Let у be a curve in E, different from the centrode pm, and Г its envelope in

on у and on Г as well. Its position in E depends on ф. If x, у are the 
coordinates of A in E, x(#), y(#) is a parametric representation of the curve 
y. The coordinates of A in the fixed plane are therefore
X = х(ф)cos ф - у (ф)sin ф + а(ф),
Y = x(#)sin ф + у(ф)со$ф + Ь(ф),
which is a parametric representation of Г. The components of the (geometric)

The components of the velocity c, of A along y, are x', y' in the o«y system 
and in the Oxv-frame they are
(9.18) vx = x'cos ф - у 'sin #, 
= x'sin ф 4- у'cos ф.
As у is tangent to Г at A, the vectors V and v are linearly dependent. Hence 
V = f(#)u Цф) being a scalar function of #, with t / 1. From (9.17) and (9.18) 
it follows
(x'cos# - у'sin #)(1 - f) = x sin ф 4- у cos# - a\
(x'sin # 4- y'cos#)(l - f) = - x cos# 4- у sin # - b\

Eliminating g0 we obtain
(9.25) 
((1/R)-(1/R,))sin 0 = l/b2
which is called the general Euier-Savary equation, of which the similar 
looking relation (9.5) is a special case. Comparing the two we formulate the 
following theorem: if Г is the envelope in 2 of the curve 7 in E, A their 
tangent point, m the center of curvature of 7 at A, M that of Г at A, then M 
coincides with the center of curvature (at m) of the curve 7' in S described by 
the point m.
If 7 reduces to a point A, m coincides with A and Г is the path of A ; (9.25) 
reduces to (9.5).
If 7 is a straight line then m is at infinity and it follows from (9.25), in view 
of R = », that M is on the cuspidal circle — which verifies a result we have 
already obtained.
We have excluded the case where 7 coincides with the moving centrode pm, 
which implies that Г is different from the fixed centrode pr. This was necessary 
since, when we have 1=1, g = ®>; moreover A coincides with О and our 
derivation is not valid. We shall see later on, however, that (9.25) also holds in 
this case. But there is an essential difference: As can be seen from (9.23), the 
center of curvature of the envelope of an arbitrary curve in E is a second 
order concept, as it depends only on b2- However, the centers of curvature of 
pm and p, depend upon third order properties, as we shall see in the next 
section.
Example 87. 
Show from (9.23) that if у is a single point A it coincides with m.
Example 88. 
Apply formula (9.23) to the case where the envelope Г reduces to a single point 
(which means that у continually passes through it during the motion).
Example 89. 
Show that: If A is an inflection point of у then the corresponding M is on the 
cuspidal circle; whereas if A is an inflection point of Г then M is on the inflection circle.
It is possible to normalize b2y to say b2= 1, by a simple linear stretch 
whereby r is replaced by cr and r by cr, c being a positive number. Hence, 
all planar motions (excluding translations) are - within a stretch — geometri­
cally identical to the second order. It is in fact possible to make all moving 
systems completely identical to the second order by: i) bringing their first 
order poles into coincidence — by a translation; ii) bringing the tangents to 
their centrodes, at ф = 0, into coincidence — by a rotation; iii) making their 
b2’s identical — by a stretch.

10. Third order properties
We now consider third order instantaneous kinematics. This topic may be 
thought of as the limiting case, as the positions approach each other, of four 
positions theory. All properties depend on the three invariants f>2, a3, by. As 
we obtained in (8.7):
Xo = x, Xi = - y, X2 = - x, Ху = у + ay, 
<1<U) У0=у. Y, = x, Y2=-y + b2. Yy=-x + b3.
First of all we derive the equation of the circling-point curve, the locus 
of the points in E whose four consecutive positions are on a circle; these 
points are identically those with stationary curvature. As к = 
(Х'У
*-
 У'Х")/(Х'2 + У'2)3" the condition k' = 0 implies
(10.2) 
(X'2 + УЛ)(Х'У"-Х
У')-3(Х'Х'
’ + У,У'г)(Х/У"-Х"У,) = 0,
*
which for the ф = 0 positions becomes
(10.3) 
(X? + У?)(Х|Уэ-ХзУ1)-3(Х|Х2+ У1У2)(Х1У2~Х2У.) = 0;
hence in view of (10.1) we obtain for the circling-point curve
(10.4) 
F = (x2+ y2)(a3x + h3y) + 3b2x(x2 + y2~ b2y) = 0, 
or
(10.5) 
(x2 + у2)((a, + 3b2)x + b3y ] - 3^xy = 0.
Example 90. Show thal (X2 + Y’b-x' + y2, (X2+ Y2), - 2(X„X, + Y.Y,)-0. (X2 + Y2),- 
2b,y. (X2 + Y2), = 2|(в1 + 3b,)x + b,y).
Example 91. 
Prove that the k>cu> of the points whose four consecutive positions are concydic 
can be derived from
KX’+Y2). X. Y. l.|-0, v = 0,1,2,3.
From (10.5) it follows that, unless а3 + ЗЬ2 = by = 0 (which is in view of 
(8.13) equivalent to dy = by = 0), the circling-point curve is a circular cubic. 
This is as expected since the circling-point curve is a limiting case of the 
circle-point curve (4.18) obtained when we studied four finitely separated 
positions. There is, however, an important simplification here compared with 
general four positions theory, for (10.5) unlike (4.18) represents a rational 
curve: It always has a node at О; the tangents at this double point are the pole 
tangent and the pole normal. The circling-point curve is sometimes also called 
the “cubic of stationary curvature'1 and by some authors simply the “circle­
point curve”.

Example 92. 
Determine the equation of the real asymptote of (10.5).
The centering-point curve is the circling-point curve of the inverse motion, 
its equation follows from (10.5) by replacing x, y, b2, a3, by by X, - Y, 
-(a3 + 362)> by, hence it reads
(10.6) 
(ayX + byY)(X2 + Y2)-3bJXY = 0,
which is a circular cubic unless ay = by = 0. It is the locus of the centers of 
curvature in £ of all point-paths with stationary curvature when E is in the 
position ф = 0. Clearly it is the limiting case of the center-point curve (5.1) 
(which is also the pole curve (4.2)).
After some algebra we obtain for the equation of the tangent, to (10.5). at 
the isotropic point Ja(lv i, 0):
(10.7) 
y = ix+<?,
with
q=(3/2)b22(a> + 3b2-iby)N-\
N = (a3 + 362)2 + bi.
The principal focus G of (10.5) is the intersection of (10.7) and its conjugate 
imaginary line which is the tangent to (10.5) at I2. We obtain
(10.8) 
G = (3/2)b22byN-l,(3/2)b22(ay^3b2)N'1;
by simple algebra we can verify that G satisfies (10.5). Hence the circling- 
point curve is a focal curve, which is as expected since this is the case for 
general four positions theory. Although this may be of some interest from a 
geometric point of view, the point G does not seem to have any special 
kinematic significance.
The locus of the points for which three consecutive positions are collinear is 
the inflection circle c with the equation x2 + y2 - b2x =0, from which the pole 
О must be excluded. Of the six intersections of c and the circling-point curve 
three coincide with О (this follows easily from (10.4)), and there is one at each 
of the isotropic points h, I2. The remaining one is the intersection, different 
from O, of c and the line a3x + 63y = 0. If a3 / 0, b3 / 0 this point, which must 
have four collinear consecutive positions and is therefore Ball’s point B, is 
given by
(10.9) 
B[- b2ayb3(a2y+ Ь}у',Ь2а}(а1+ Mf1].
This result still has meaning if a3/0, b3 = 0; then В coincides with the 
inflection pole. If, however, a3 = 0, 63/ 0, the point (10.9) coincides with О

and the argument is not valid. A very special case arises if a3 = by = 0: then 
the circling-point curve (10.4) degenerates into the inflection circle and the 
pole normal, hence every point on c, except O, is a Ball point. In this case the 
moving plane is said to be in a Cardan position, a terminology which will be 
explained when, in Chapter IX, we deal with a special plane motion.
For a general motion Х'У"- X*Y'
 = 0 represents the set of inflection 
circles. Hence, in instantaneous kinematics, the intersections of the circle c 
and the consecutive inflection circle coincide with the intersections of 
X>Y2-X2Yt = 0 and X,У,-Х3У, = 0, that is of x2 + y2- b2y = 0 and 
a3x + b3y = 0. These points are О and B. Hence the inflection circle touches 
its envelope at the pole and at Ball’s point. This envelope consists therefore of 
two curves: the fixed centrode pf and the locus of Ball’s points, which is called 
Ball's curve.
Example 93. Show that if a, = b, e 0 the centering-point curve degenerates into the pole 
tangent, the pole normal and the line at infinity.
Example 94. 
Show that if a3 « bt “ 0, the circling-point curve degenerates into the pole tangent,

of the direct and the inverse motion are one another's reflections into Ox, we 
see that (10.12) is the Ball point В of the inverse motion — as could be 
expected.
The coordinates of the instantaneous rotation center are first order 
quantities of the motion. Hence the curvatures of the centrodes depend on 
the third order properties of the motion, and are therefore a subject of this 
section.
For the fixed centrode pf we have found (7.5)
(10.13) 
X = a-b', Y-b + e',
and for the moving one, pm, (7.4)
(10.14) 
x = а'»пф - Ь'со$ф, у = а'созф + Ь'ыпф.
Непсе we have for pf if ф = 0,
X, = - b2, Y, = 0, X2« - hj, Y2 = b2+ai9
and we obtain for the radius of curvature Rt of pf at O,
(10.15) 
- Rt = (X? + Y^KXt Y2 - X2 Y.) = - bl/(a> + b2).
Analogously, from (10.14),
Xi = - b2t

so that
(10.17) 
((l/Km)-(l/Rf))=l/b2.
This is the second Euler-Savary equation. As pf is the envelope of pm and the 
centers of curvature are both on Or, which implies 6 = тг/2, the formula 
(10.17) is in accordance with the general expression (9.25).

(at ф - 0) on opposite sides of their tangent. When their centers are on the same side of the 
tangent, the У-axis is directed toward or away from the curvature centers depending upon 
whether Ят< R, or Rm> R, respectively. These three situations representing all possible cases

We give one more application of third order theory. The radius of 
curvature of the path p at A is a second order concept, and the same holds for 
the coordinates of the center of curvature M and hence for its locus, the 
evolute p of the path. This implies that the center of curvature M of p (at M) 
is a third order covariant, sometimes called the second center of curvature of 
p at A. It has been considered by R. Muller (MOller [1891a]) who found a 
procedure to construct M; MOller [1891b] also found similar results for 
evolutes of envelopes of generating curves. We will develop these concepts

11. Fourth order properties
In fourth order theory (that is, dealing with five infinitesimal positions) an 
important problem is to determine those points of E whose paths have in the 
zero-position five points in common with their osculating circle: the Burmes- 
ter points for the instantaneous case. The circling-point curve has been 
derived by means of equation (10.2). The points asked for are on F = 0, given 
by (10.5), and moreover on the consecutive circling-point curve, which implies 
that they satisfy the equation found by taking the derivative of (10.2) and 
putting ф = 0:
(X? + У?)(Х1У4-Х4У1 + Х2У3-ХэУ2)-(Х|Х2 + У|У2)(Х1У3-Х,У1) 
(1L1) 
-3(X,Y2-X2Y,)(X2
2 + У5+Х,Х3 + у.у3) = о,
which in view of
X0 = x, Xj=-y, X2 = -x, X3=y+a3, X4 = x+a4, 
(1I,2) Уо = у, y, = x. Y2=-y + b2, Y^-x + by, Yt=y + b„ 
yields the equation
F»[(a4 + 4Ьэ)х + (-4a3+ 64- 6b2)y + 3b2](x2 + y1 - b2y)
+ b2y [x2 + y2 + (a4x + 64y)] = 0.
It represents a circular cubic, passing through O, the tangent at О being 
у = 0. Of the nine intersections of F and F, two coincide with I2 and three 
with O. The remaining four are the Burmester points (Muller [1892]). These 
points were first studied by R. Muller who named them after L. Burmester 
(who had studied the analogous points for the five-finitely-separated-positions 
case).
Example 98. Show that (№ Y*)*
 = 2((a4 + 4b3)x + (- 4a, + Ь4 - 6Ь,)у + 3bj).
Example 99. Derive (11.3) from the condition |(X2 + Y*)
B X„ Y, IJ =0, v = 0.1,2,4.
In Section 5 we have developed another method to determine the Burmes­
ter points, in the general case. We introduced the homogeneous unknowns u, 
(i = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6), satisfying four linear and two quadratic equations. The 
Burmester points (and the Burmester centers at the same time) were found in 
terms of the intersections of two conics. If we apply this procedure to the 
instantaneous case, the four linear equations are the first four derivatives of:

which is much simpler than in the general case. The two quadratic equations 
remain (5.12), exactly as in the general case. Hence, once (11.5) is substituted 
for (5.13), the procedure becomes identical to the one discussed in Section 5. 
The determinants Д and Д' (introduced in Section 5 as the determinants of 
columns 2, 3, 6, 7 and 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively) do simplify in this case. In fact, for 
the instantaneous case we have
(11.6) 
Д = - a^b< + a4bi -
Д = 0 is the condition for one Burmester center to be at infinity. This means 
that the corresponding point is such that its five consecutive positions are 
collinear; in Veldkamp’s terminology it is a Ball point with excess one. Such a 
point does not exist in general, but will be present if the instantaneous 
invariants satisfy Д = 0.
Example 100. Prove the relation Д = 0 is necessary for there to exist a solution (x, y) of 
X,: 
X,: Уа-Х3: У,- X<: Y4.
Example 101. Prove that a Ball point with excess one exists if the plane has a Cardan position 
(i.e., a, ■» Ьз=

 0), and determine its coordinates.
Our discussion of point-paths has so far been restricted to those special 
points which to a given order move on straight lines, circles or other conics. A 
more general approach would be one which determines those points in E with 
paths in 2 which, to a given order, describe any specified trajectory. To 
accomplish this we characterize a plane curve by its curvature A, the curvature 
of its evolute A, and the curvature of the evolute of its evolute A*.
 If the 
trajectory p of a moving point A has at ф = 0 a curvature ko, its center of 
curvature M is a point on the evolute p, of p, which at M has a curvature k0 
(Fig. 70). Further, the evolute p has an evolute curve p*  which contains M the 
center of curvature of M on p. The curvature of p*  at M is denoted by ki. 
The problem we set ourselves is to determine all points A in E for which, at 
ф = 0, k0 = Ao, ko = A0A, and k*  = A0A2, where Ao, Ab A2 are a specified set of 
real numbers. It follows from this that

From differential geometry it is known that if к / 0

and from this one easily gets k' by differentiating. Also, s' = (X'2 + Y,2)'n. 
Substituting these into (11.8), and then evaluating at ф = 0 by use of (10.1) 
and (11.6) we find
(11.9) 
(N7A,)-F = 0
where F = 0 is the circling-point curve given by (10.4), and N = x2 + y2- b2y = 
0 is the inflection circle. Clearly (11.9) represents a bicircular quartic. It has 
been named the quartic of derivative curvature. It is a rational curve, since it

always has a third node. This node is at the pole, and one of its tangents there 
is the pole tangent Ox. This curve also passes through the Ball point.
Equation (11.9) was first derived by Freudenstein [1965], and later studied 
by Veldkamp [1967b]. It may be regarded as a generalization of the 
circling-point equation. It is the locus of all points in E which generate paths 
which, at ф = 0, have curvature ratio fco/ko = A|. All such paths are, within a 
stretch, identical to the third order. Since A , is an intrinsic property of a planar 
curve which describes it to the third order (within a stretch), (11.9) allows us to 
determine third order approximations to any curve whatsoever (to obtain the 
given curve we “stretch” E so that the curvature is Ao).
Example 102. Show that for a circle (l/A,) = 0, and therefore (11.9) yields the circling point 
curve.
Example 103. Show that (11.7) may be obtained by taking the derivative of the radius of 
curvature p with respect to the arc lengths s, and substituting the following definitions: p « 1/Дс, 
da/dp ■ k, da/ds « k. where a is the angle of the tangent line to curve p at point A.
Example 104. Show that the coordinates of the evolute can be obtained from the original 
curve by either of the following methods: i) if the curve has coordinates X, Y, the 
evolute has coordinates X., Y. where Xr “ X - (d Y/dX)(W), Y. » Y + W with W « 
(I + (dY/dX)2)/(d2 Y/dX2); ii) if the equation of the curve is f(X, Y) = 0 and the normal to it is

a new equation f(Xc, Yc, Y)« 0. The evolute is the envelope of the normals, i.e., the resultant of 
eliminating Y between KXe, Y«, Y) - 0 and Jf(Xc, Ye, Y)/d Y = 0.

(11.11) represents a tricircular sextic with a triple point at the pole having O, 
as one of its tangents. (11.11) intersects (11.9) at five points other than the pole 
and the circle points at infinity. These five points were originally derived by 
Freudenstein [1965] who named them the generalized Burmester points. 
The result is that given a motion, up to the fourth order, there are at most five 
points which approximate any given planar curve characterized by the

numbers Аь A2. Hence, within a stretch, these points move on trajectories for 
which, at ф = 0, k0= Ao, k0 = A0Ab fc X = A0A2. In general Ao is a different 
number for each of these five points. In order to match a given planar curve to 
the fourth order, A, and A2 must be calculated at the desired point on the 
curve, and then the generalized Burmester points computed using these 
values. Once a generalized Burmester point is known, E must be “stretched” 
(i.e., x —> Cx, у СуУ C is a real number) so that the Burmester point’s path 
curvature equals Ao. Freudenstein and Woo [1968] have given a further 
generalization of curve matching concepts using the so-called intrinsic proper­
ties of a curve.
Example 105. Consider the Ball point and show that it is in effect a sixth generalized Burmester 
point (Veldkamp [1967b]).
In Sections 5 and 6 we have discussed some problems arising when five or 
more finitely separated positions are given. We leave it to the reader to 
modify these problems for the instantaneous case. Some results are inserted 
into the following:
Example 106. The locus of points for which five consecutive positions are on a parabola is a 
bicircular quartic, passing through the pole О and through Ball's point 0; it is tangent at these 
points to the inflection circle (Sandor and Freudenstein [1967]; Bottema [1967]).
Example 107. 
The locus of points, six consecutive positions of which are on a conic, is a 
bicircular quintic with double points at О and at B. (Idem.)
Example 108. 
There are six points in E for which six consecutive positions are on a parabola. 
(Idem.)
Example 109. 
There are eleven points for which seven consecutive positions are on a conic. 
(Idem.)
Example 110. Derive the equation for the locus of all lines (a curve of the second class) which 
have five consecutive positions tangent to a parabola. Show that the locus is either a hyperbola or 
degenerate (Bottema [1970]).
Example 111. 
Derive the equation of the locus of the lines (a curve of the fourth class) which 
have six consecutive positions tangent to a conic. (Idem.)
In Sections 8-11 of this chapter we have discussed instantaneous properties 
of the motion by introducing a canonical frame: О at the pole, Ox along the 
pole tangent. There are some problems where it is advantageous to-take other 
frames. Such an approach has been used in investigating the properties of 
Ball’s curve, that is the locus of Ball’s point (either in the moving or in the 
fixed plane) during a continuous motion. It was found appropriate to take the 
origin at B, and the X-axis along BP, P being the pole.

Example 113. 
И В is a Ball point with excess one, show that it is at a cusp of Ball’s curve 
(R. Muller [1898]. [1903]).
In our treatment of instantaneous plane kinematics we have set two 
restrictions: the pole is a finite point and the invariant b2^ 0, which implies 
that the geometric velocity at which the centrodes change contact points is 
unequal to zero and that the inflection circle has a positive radius.
If the position has a (finite) pole, this means that the rotation angle ф is not 
stationary, so that it may be chosen as the (geometrical) motion’s parameter. 
If av and bv are zero for every value of v then a = b = 0 for all ф and the 
motion is a rotation about a fixed point. If av = bv = 0, v = 0,1,2,..., n - 1, 
but a„, bn are not zero, we take the Ox-axis, such that an = 0. Then we have

case.

Consider the case b2 « 0, by / 0 and modify our results for third and fourth order

of this implies that the trajectory of о taken as a whole has a cusp at the pole, 
since the curve may retrace itself and pass through X = 0, Y = 0 several times 
(Veldkamp [1963]).

(Idem.)
12. Translations
The preceding discussions on instantaneous kinematics fail if there is no 
(finite) pole in the zero position. In the case of a finite pole, t being an 
arbitrary parameter describing the motion, we have ф/O for the zero 
position t = 0. For geometrical problems (those which are independent of the 
choice of the parameter), it was therefore natural to take ф = г, ф = 1.
If there is no finite pole we have ф = 0 for t = 0. The velocity distribution is 
then that of a translation (instead of a rotation) of the plane. This is the reason 
why these positions have been called T-positions by Veldkamp, who discussed 
them at length (Veldkamp [1963, p. 127—144]). If, for t =0, (di<^/dft) = 0 
(k = 1,2,...»n) and (d^'^/df
**
1)/0 the position is called a T-position of 
order n or simply a T„-position. In this case it is advisable to introduce a 
parameter t such that ф = (r"
*
,/(n + 1)!), and use the notation whereby if z(/) 
is any function of /, (d"z/dr”)l.o is denoted by z„. We shall restrict ourselves to 
the case n = 1, ф = \ t2 and therefore: фп = ф} = 0, ф2 = 1, Фк = 0 (к > 2).
For the series for cos ф we obtain
cos ф = 1-(ф72!) + (4>74!)------ --  1-(г7(22-2!))-ь(г7(24‘4!))------
This implies
(cos^)o=l, (cos ф), = (cos ф )г = (cos ф )i = 0, (cos<£)4= -3,

this case (sometimes called a T-position of the second kind) we have: every 
point of E has the same velocity. We choose the positive X-axis parallel to 
this velocity direction, thereby at> 0 and hi=0.

We take the X-axis along this pole tangent, which implies a2 = 0. From (12.3) 
it then follows that
X2 = -y, У2 = х + Ь2.
Since the origin is not yet localized on the X-axis, we take О such that for this 
point Y2 - 0; hence b2 = 0. The two coinciding frames are now completely 
determined. We obtain the following table for this canonical coordinate 
system:
X0=x, Xi = 0,

position, no further ones for the second, a3 and b3 for the third, etc.
Example 119. Show that the inverse of a T-position is a T-position, and determine

From (12.7) it follows that the curvature of the path of A (x, у) is given by 
(Xi У2-Х2У|)/(Х? + yJ)3/2 = у lb J; hence the inflection curve, a circle in the 
general case, degenerates into у = 0, that is, the pole tangent. The center of 
curvature M of A (x, y) is [(xy - b\)/y, у ]. The Euler-Savary equation is not 
recognizable for these special positions and neither is Hartmann’s theorem. 
But the statement that a point A on the pole tangent has its center M at the 
pole P still holds. So does Bobillier’s theorem. Indeed, let Ai(xbyi) and 
A2(x2, y2), with y(/y2, be two points and hence M, = [(x,y - 6?)/y„ y,J, 
(i = 1,2), are their associated centers. It is easy to verify that the intersection 
T(X, У) of AxA2 and M}M2 has the ordinate У = у» + y2 (Fig. 71). Hence TP 
and the pole-tangent are one another’s reflections into the “bisector” of AtP 
and A2P. So much for second order properties.
Example 120. Show that in our T-position the origin О plays the part of the inflection pole.
Third order properties depend on the three invariants a3, b2. The 
condition for the existence of a Ball’s point is X>: У> e X2: У2 ж Хэ: У3. 
Substituting from (12.7) the conclusion is: in the general case, a3 / 0, there is 
no Ball point at all; if, however, a3 = 0, any point of the pole tangent (that is 
the inflection curve) is a Ball point.
The general equation of the circling-point curve is (10.3)

hence, in the case at hand, we obtain
(12.8) 
xy = -(1/3)M>,
which represents an orthogonal hyperbola, with О as its center, and Ox and 
Oy as its asymptotes (Fig. 72). We find therefore that for a Trposition the 
circling-point curve breaks up into a hyperbola and the line at infinity in E. 
The hyperbola lies in the first and third quadrant if a3<0, in the second and 
fourth if a3>0, and degenerates into the coordinate axes if a3 = 0.
In general third order theory we have derived the second Euler-Savary 
relation (10.17). Obviously there is no direct analog for a T-position.

certain analog with the general theory (see Example 95).
Fourth order properties are controlled by bt, a4, b4. Burmester points 
in the general case are the intersections of the circling-point curve and the

13. Time as a parameter
Until now we have dealt in this chapter with geometrical, that is time­
independent, kinematics. We suppose now that the displacements are such 
that the three parameters (ф, a, b) are functions of the time t. If in the 
zero-position ф / 0 we are still able to take ф as the geometrical parameter 
and treat a, b as functions of ф. The new element in the discussion is that ф is 
now a function of t (and therefore by implication so are a, b).
The most important properties of the time-dependent motion of a point, of 
the moving plane, are its velocity and its acceleration, and to some degree its 
“second acceleration’* (the third derivative with respect to r of the position 
of a point). We introduce, at t = 0, the notations ф = o>( / 0), ф = e, ф = b.
The velocity distribution is very simple. We have
(13.1) 
Х=-юу, У = шх;
which is a rotation about О with angular velocity ы. Indeed, (13.1) follows 
from X = x (со$ф) - у (sin ф) + a, Y = x (sin ф)*+  у (со5ф) + b since for 
t = 0: (со$ф) = 0, (sin ф) = w, d = aiw = 0, b = bta) = 0.
Similarly for the acceleration we note that (сояф)’ = 
($тф) " = e,
a = a2<02 + fliE = 0, b’ = b2a>2 + biE = 62w2; it follows
(13.2) 
X = - cu2x - ry, Y = ex - tu2y + <a2b2.
From these expressions it follows that the acceleration of the velocity pole 
of E is always w262, directed toward the inflection pole (i.e., along the positive 
У-axis). Clearly the velocity pole cannot also be an acceleration pole unless 
u> = 0 or b2 = 0.
As ш/0, we have <o4+e2/0. Hence there is one point, the acceleration 
pole Г, with zero acceleration, viz

If we introduce polar coordinates r, 6, with x = rcos0, у = rsin 0, where v„ 
v*  are the components of the velocity vector v in the r- and ^-direction and 
a*  those of the acceleration a, we can project the Cartesian components of 
(13.1) and (13.2) onto the polar directions and obtain

v, = 0, v9 = u>r, a, = co2(-r + fc2sin 0), <•  = cr + <u2f>2

Obviously a, and ae are, in our canonical system, the components of a 
normal and tangential to the path respectively. We have a, = 0 if r = 62sin0, 
which implies that the locus of the points for which the normal component of 
acceleration vanishes is the inflection circle; this could have been expected 
since ar = (v2/p), p being the radius of curvature of the path. The locus of the 
points with ae = 0 has the equation er + a>2b2cos0 = 0, which represents for 
e/0 the circle n (sometimes called the normal circle), tangent at О to Or>

distribution is described by

Time-dependent instantaneous kinematics for a T-position is very simple. It 
is easy to derive by direct differentiation of (12.3), if we let the parameter t

X = 0,

From which it may be concluded that: the velocity is (0, b>) for every point. 
For e / 0 the acceleration pole coincides with the origin; the acceleration of a 
point A is orthogonal to О A and equal to e (OA); if e =0 the acceleration of 
every point is zero. If 6X0 the pole of the second acceleration is

CHAPTER IX
SPECIAL MOTIONS
1. General remarks
In all preceding chapters we dealt with motions in the general sense, 
deriving theorems valid for any motion whatsoever. We consider now 
specified motions, thus specializing the general theory. Our examples, besides 
being often interesting in themselves, also serve as specific illustrations of our 
general results. The present chapter borders more than any other upon what 
may be called applied kinematics, a subject not explicitly inserted in this 
book. Kinematics has been applied for engineering purposes in two ways: 
there are machines producing motions and it may be useful to investigate or 
even to predict the kinematic properties of these motions; in doing so one 
deals with kinematic analysis. A more modem application is kinematic 
synthesis: if one wants to construct a machine such that it generates a 
prescribed motion (say, the path of a certain point or its velocity) kinematics 
may be used as a tool. In this respect the word machine has a rather restricted 
sense: its stands for an abstract model, an approach to reality, consisting of a 
finite number of rigid bodies linked together in some way, thus restricting the 
movability of the components so that the system has, in general, one, and 
sometimes more, degrees-of-freedom. Such a set is called a mechanism. As 
the shape of the bodies is not of primary importance, each of them may be 
considered as a moving space and is therefore subject to the kinematic theory 
as developed in the preceding chapters.
A motion can be defined in various ways. It may be done in a purely 
analytical manner by giving (in the general displacement formula P = Ap + d) 
the matrix A and the vector d explicitly as specified functions of a parameter. 
Examples will follow in Section 6. Usually, however, the motion is described 
in geometrical terms. We know that a 3-dimensional space E moving with 
respect to a fixed space X has six degrees of freedom. Hence its motion is 
specified if the displacements of E satisfy five conditions. The condition that a

specific point A of E remains on a given surface of £ (a plane, a sphere, etc.) 
is a single one; if the path of A is prescribed it satisfies two conditions; if it is 
permanently at rest three conditions must be satisfied. If a line I of E is 
constrained to intersect permanently a given line of 2, or to be tangent to a 
given surface, or more general, to belong to a given complex of lines in 2, it 
must satisfy one condition; if 1 must obey two such requirements (or more 
general, if it must belong to a given congruence of lines in £) the condition is 
equivalent to two single ones; the number is three if I is compelled to be a 
generator of a ruled surface (for instance a ruled quadric surface or a pencil of 
lines); the number is four if I, as a whole, must be invariant. Analogously for a 
moving plane: passing through a fixed point or being tangent to a given 
surface imposes one conditon, belonging to a given developable of planes (for 
instance if it must pass through a given line of X) is equivalent to two, having 
an invariant position is equivalent to three single conditions.
The constraints may be on more complicated elements than the foregoing 
elementary examples of points, lines or planes: if a sphere must remain 
tangent to a given plane we have one condition, if the sphere rolls (without 
slipping) on it the condition is threefold. All kinds of combinations may exist. 
If the total number of (equivalent) single conditions is equal to five, there is a 
reasonable possibility that a motion satisfying the constraints exists, but this is 
by no means a certainty. The set of conditions may be dependent (which 
would mean that the degree of freedom for E is more than one) or 
contradictory (and no motion possible), or it may not have any real solution. 
A trivial example of the latter circumstance: if two points at a distance a are 
compelled to remain on two skew lines respectively, with distance b, 
obviously no motion is possible if a < b.
We may add that a motion may be defined also by its kinematic properties, 
for instance by its two axodes. A combination of analytical and geometrical 
data is also possible; the motion of Section 2 is an example of this kind.
Example 1. Show that in the following examples the primitive counting of constraints gives the 
(decisive) number five: a) five points each remain in a given plane; b) two points remain on a 
circle, a third on a sphere; c) a point remains on a line, two lines each intersect a given line, a 
plane passes through a point; d) two planes each pass through a line, a third through a point.
There are some generally important motions called algebraic motions: 
these are characterized by the properties that they generate algebraic loci 
such that the path of every point is an algebraic curve, every plane describes 
an algebraic developable, every line an algebraic ruled surface. In Section 11 
we shall see that there exist in plane kinematics certain formulas giving the 
order and the circularity of any path if these characteristic numbers are

known for two paths. No analogously general relations seem to exist in spatial 
kinematics, although there are some for rather simple cases, see for example 
Darboux (1897) and Sommerville (1934, p. 382). However, there do exist 
simple equalities between characteristic numbers for a motion and the inverse 
motion, given by Chasles (1837):
Let the paths of the direct motion be of order n. This means: a fixed plane a 
in £ has n intersections with every path; in other words, a moving point P 
coincides in n positions with a point of a. For the inverse motion P is a fixed 
point and a a moving plane, and the conclusion is: in n positions of a it passes 
through P or, in other words, the class of the developable described by a is 
equal to n. Conversely the class of a developable described by a moving plane 
under the direct motion is equal to the order of the path of a point under the 
inverse motion.
If the order of the ruled surface S generated by a moving line 1 under the 
direct motion is m this means that S has m points in common with a line Г of 
X, that is: 1 intersects Г in m positions of the moving space E. It follows 
immediately that, for the inverse motion, any line Г of £ generates a ruled 
surface of order m.
We will refer to the foregoing two paragraphs as Chasles’ theorem.
2. The Frenet-Serret motion
The first special motion we study furnishes an illustration of the general 
theory wherein the axodes and their striction curves can be determined 
explicitly and yet are not trivial. This motion is defined in terms of a space 
curve Г fixed in 2:
The motion is such that the moving frame oKyt moves with о along Г while 
rotating so that the x and у axes always coincide with, respectively, the 
tangent and principal normal of Г. This means that as о coincides with a point 
О of Г the frame coincides with the Frenet-Serret trihedron at Q : Q^>. 
This trihedron consists of the tangent the principal normal Qn, and the 
binormal O„ which are three mutually orthogonal axes. Obviously, the 
geometry of this motion is completely defined by Г.
If P and p are the position vectors, of a moving point, measured in 2 and E 
respectively, we know that for any motion
(2.1) 
P = Ap + d
A is an orthogonal matrix and d is the displacement vector of the origin, both 
depend upon the motion parameter.

For our special motion, because о moves along Г, P = d represents the

So much for the direction of the screw axis. To determine its position in the 
-frame, suppose that it intersects the plane osy at (x0, yo,0) and that the 
translation parallel to the screw axis is (wo,0, ka0). The velocity vector of the 
origin would be (ky0 + та0, - fcx0, - ry0 + ka0) and as (by virtue of P'o = d' = 
l) it must be (1,0,0) we have xo = 0, y0= k/(k2+ t2), a0 = r/(k2 + t2). The 
conclusion is (Fig. 75): the instantaneous screw axis intersects oy, the principal 
normal, at the point S, such that oS - к/(к2+т2); it is parallel to the plane 
ож,; the components of ш are (r,0,k) and that of the translation vector 
[т2/(к2 +т2),0, кт/(к2 +r2)]. Note that, as developed here, the angular and 
the linear velocities are geometrical concepts with the arc length of Г acting as 
“time”.

As the instantaneous screw always intersects the principal normal at a right 
angle, its locus—the moving axode—is a special type of ruled surface called a

3. Darboux’s motion
In a classical investigation Darboux [1881] has completely solved the
problem of determining all possible motions of E with respect to 1 such that 
the path of every point of E is a plane curve. There are of course trivial
examples, for instance the case in which the planes of the paths are all 
parallel. We suppose that every plane of 2 containes the path of at least one
point. Following Darboux we consider first the inverse motion, which has also 
been studied by Mannheim [1889]; it has some interest in itself and we deal

and cyclically for PJt and Pl3.
Verify that 1 Р,лРп = 0.
Example 5. 
Determine the screw axis and the axodes if Г is a helical curve on a general (i.e., not 
necessarily right-angular) cylinder (k/r being a constant).
Example 6. 
Determine the screw axis and the axodes if Г is a common helix (k and r being both 
constants).
The principal normal is the common perpendicular of two consecutive 
screw axes; hence S is the striction point. The conclusion is that the striction 
curve in the moving space is the straight line x = z = 0.
Example 7. 
Show that a parametric representation of the striction curve on the fixed axode is
X =■ a + ntq, Y = b + n^, Z = c + nyq, q = к /(к3 + т7).
This motion has been studied by Darboux [1887] who introduced it in 
order to derive the Frenet-Serret formulas by kinematic means. The geomet­
ric angular-velocity vector Л is named, after him, the Darboux vector.

with it in Section 4. Obviously it is a motion of 2 with respect to E such that 
any plane a, of 1 passes permanently through a fixed point Л of E. Let a2 be 
a plane of 2 parallel to a( al the distance d \ a2 passes through P2. Hence at 
describes a developable of planes in E, all passing through Pi and such that 
the distance of P2 to any plane of the developable equals d. This implies that 
the developable consists of the tangent planes of a circular cone with vertex 
Pi. As on was arbitrarily chosen, any plane of 2 generates such a cone. In view 
of Chasles' theorem of Section 1, we conclude that (if the motion under 
consideration is possible) the paths of the direct motion are conics.
Without any loss of generality we may suppose that a( has the equation 
Z + ei = 0 and therefore the coordinates Ui = 0, U2 = 0, U3 = 1, U4 = et; a2 is 
therefore the plane (0,0, l,e2); let oh pass through P( = (0,0, zt), a2 through 
(0,0, z2). The formulas for the transformation of plane coordinates give us 
then that a plane (0,0,1, e,) passes during the motion through a point (0,0, z.). 
In other words: if the planes of a parallel set of planes each pass through a 
fixed point of E these points are all on a line 1(a), associated with the set. The 
angle 6(a) between 1(a) and any plane of the set is constant during the motion 
and so is therefore the angle between 1(a) and its projection Г(а) on such a 
plane. So far we have only derived properties of the motion that deal with the 
direction of lines, that is with the motion of the points in the plane at infinity, 
or (if we take an arbitrary origin О and speak in analytic terms) with the 
matrix A of the motion equation. Isolating the rotational part AT for this 
inverse motion we obtain that this corresponds to a motion about О such that 
any line Г through О describes, during the motion, a circular cone with axis I. 
The question whether such a motion is possible is equivalent to one in 
spherical kinematics: can a sphere move about its center in such a way that 
every point on it describes a circle? The answer is obviously positive: this is of 
course the case when the sphere rotates about a fixed line through O. We shall 
prove that this is the only possibility. This may be done by means of formula 
(6.11) of Chapter VII which gives us the locus of points on the sphere with 
(instantaneously) four coplanar consecutive positions. In our case every point 
must satisfy this equation, which implies that e = (yx = yr) = 0. Hence during 
the motion we must have e = 0 and therefore co is a constant. The conclusion 
is that the lines 1(a) for various sets of parallel planes are all parallel.
If AT represents the set of rotations about a fixed axis a the same holds for 
A; a is a fixed line in both 2 and E. We introduce frames such that a coincides 
with both Oz and oz; we take the rotation angle ф as the motion parameter. 
Considering now the direct motion and adding the translation part, we 
conclude that the motion is necessarily of the following type

Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + a sin ф,
Z = z 4- b sin ф + c(l - cos</>),
where a, b, c are constants. Note that the two frames coincide for ф = 0.
It is easy to show that all paths of (3.4) are plane curves. Indeed, using 
tan(<£/2) = r, sin ф = 2t/(1 + /2), cos ф = (1 - t2)/( 1 4- f3), the homogeneous 
coordinates X, Y, Z, W (in J) can be expressed as quadratic functions of the 
parameter t; hence all paths are conics and therefore plane curves. Moreover, 
as their intersections with W = 0 follow from t = ±i they are ellipses.
Example 8. Show that two points on a parallel to o, describe congruent paths.
Example9. Show that the points of the line x « - (a1 + b3 - c’)/(2a), у = be la, describe circles. 
Example 10. Show that the path of a point in w = 0 is a conic in W = 0; when does it degenerate?
If (th, U2y U3y U4) is the plane in J of the path of the point (x, y, z, w) in E, 
we must have S 1ЛХ = 0 for all values of ф. That gives us three equations, 
linear in U, and linear in x, y, z, w as well. If we solve with respect to U, the 
solution is in general

(3.5) 
= (x’+ y2+ axw)wy LJ4- - (x2 + y2 + axw)(z 4- cw),
and if we solve with respect to x, y, z, w we obtain

(3-6) z = - (Ш, + U)(U? + UJ), w = (U? + Ul)U,.
Hence there exists a birational cubic relationship between the points of the 
moving space and the planes of their paths. There are singularities in both 
directions. If in (3.5) we have U, = 0 (i = 1,2,3,4) the plane is undetermined, 
an infinity of planes passes through the path, which is therefore a straight line.

From (3.6) it follows that a plane in J contains in general the path of one 
point. Those planes for which the moving point is not uniquely determined 
are exceptional, these are the planes Uy = U4 = 0 and the planes through Oz.
Example 14. Show that the exceptional plane (Ut, U2.0.0) contains the path of all points on the 
line ж - - aU2J(U2 + U’), у e aUtUJlU2 + consider in particular the plane (b, -c,0,0).
It follows at once from (3.4) that during the motion the coordinate axis o, 
remains parallel to Oz and that the angular velocity vector, in the fixed and in 
the moving space, is parallel to these axes. This implies that the fixed axode 
and the moving axode are both cylinders, with their generators perpendicular 
to Oxy and oxy respectively. Hence the instantaneous screw axis is the locus of 
the points with velocity parallel to Oz. It follows from (3.4) that the geometric 
velocity is
X = - x sin ф - у cos </>,
(3.7) 
Y = x cos ф - у sin ф + a cos ф,
Z = b cos ф + c sin ф.
The equations X = Y = 0 are satisfied by
(3.8) 
x = - a cos2 ф = - la(l 4- cos2<£), у = a sin ф cos ф = \a sin 
The equation of the moving axode Cm is therefore
(3.9) 
x2+y2 + ax=0,
which represents a circular cylinder with diameter a, tangent to the oy,-plane 
along og.
From (3.4) and (3.8) it follows that the position of the instantaneous screw 
axis in the fixed space is given by
(3.10) 
X = - a cos ф, Y = a sin ф,
and the fixed axode C( is
(3.11) 
X2+Y2=a2,
again a circular cylinder, but with diameter 2a. The moving axode is internally 
tangent to the fixed axode. The Darboux motion is generated if Cm rolls along 
the inside of Ct while it translates parallel to the axes of the cylinders; the 
magnitude of this translation depends on the rotation angle ф and is equal to 
b sin ф + c(l - cos</>).

moments the velocity distribution is that of a rotation.
Example 19. Determine the center of the ellipse described by (x, y, z).
From (3.4) we obtain the transformation from the coordinates of a line p,, of 
E to its coordinates P,, in 2:

 sin ф cos ф - ар24 sin2 ф,
with к(ф) = b sin ф + с(1 - cos ф).
If we rationalize sin ф and соьф by means of 1ап(ф/2) = r, the Pti are seen 
to be functions of t of the fourth degree; (P|4, P24, and Pu contain the factor 
(1 + f2)). Hence a line 1 of E describes in 1 a (rational) ruled surface R4 of 
order four. As any point A on 1 describes an ellipse, the surface contains a 
system of ellipses. It may be generated by the joins of corresponding points 
of two projective ellipses (corresponding points having the same value of r) 
and is therefore a well-known surface in line geometry.
Let A and В be two points of the moving line 1 and a and p the planes of 
their paths. The path of В has two intersections B, and B2 (real or imaginary) 
with a; if Ab A2 are the corresponding positions of A, the lines AjB, and 
A2B2 are the generators of R4. Hence the intersection of a and R4 (which must 
be of order four) consists of the ellipse described by A and two generators. In 
other words: during its motions the line 1 is twice in a, and each time a is a 
tangent plane since it contains 1 and the velocity vector of A; hence a is a 
double tangent plane of R4. The system of planes a, for variable A, is 
therefore the double tangent developable of R4. As the coordinates (x, y, z, w) 
of A are linear functions of a parameter it follows from (3.5) that the 
developable is of the third class. The plane W = 0 at infinity belongs to the

developable; its intersection with R4 consists of the conic described by the 
point at infinity of I and two conjugate imaginary lines: if 1 +12 = 0 we have 
P14 = P24 ~ P У4 = 0.
Any plane of the developable contains two generators; their intersection S 
is a double point of R4, i.e., an arbitrary line through S has four points in 
common with R4, of which two coincide with S. The locus of 5 is the double 
curve of R4; it can be shown to be a twisted cubic.
We have, in the foregoing, considered the path of a point and the surface 
generated by a line when E is constrained to a Darboux motion. The 
apparatus we have developed enabled us to investigate the developable 
generated in S by a plane of E; if we obtain the formulas for R4 and use (3.4), 
R4 is seen to be of the fourth class. We return to this problem in the next 
section.
The Darboux motion is a much studied example of a spatial motion. We 
shall meet it in another context in Section 4; a generalization will be given in 
Section 5. The motion, as given by (3.4) contains three parameters a, b, c ;*  
hence there are a variety of cases. An important special one, defined by a = 0, 
will be dealt with in Section 7; another with a = b = c= 0in Section 10. For 
certain special cases the general properties given above must be modified.
A derivation of the Darboux motion making use of spatial instantaneous 
invariants has been given by Veldkamp [1967а].
4. Mannheim’s motion
In this section we make some remarks about the inverse of Darboux’s 
motion. We already know some of its properties because it was the starting 
point of the preceding section. In this so-called Mannheim motion every plane 
passes through a fixed point; apart from trivial cases it is the only motion with 
this property. Moreover every moving plane envelopes a circular cone.
Solving for x, y, z from (3.4) and interchanging x, y, z, Ф with X, Y, Z, - Ф. 
the Mannheim motion reads
X = x cos ф - у sin ф ~ a sin2 ф,
(4.1) 
Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + a sin ф cos ф,
Z = z + b sin ф - c(l -со5ф).
* A. Grunwald [1906] claims that by a suitable transformation of the frames the constant c 
can be removed, but this statement does not seem to be correct.

The axodes Cm and Cf of Section 3 change their roles. Hence for the case at 
hand the fixed axode is a circular cylinder of diameter a, and is on the interior 
of the moving one which has the diameter 2a.
The path of a moving point follows immediately from (4.1). With 
homogeneous coordinates and the rational parameter t we obtain
X = x(l-f4)-2yf(l + f2)-4awf2,
Y = 2xf(l 4- /2) + y(l - r4)4- 2awt(l - t2), 
(4-2) 
Z = z(l + t2)2 + 2bwt( 1 + t2)-cwt2(l + t2),
W=w(l + t2'f.
Hence the path of an arbitrary point is a rational space curve of the fourth 
order, a so-called quartic of the second kind. Any path is for t = ± i tangent 
to the plane at infinity; the tangent points are the same for all paths, they are 
seen to be the isotropic points h and I2 of the plane Z = 0.
Example 20. 
Show that the tangent to the path at It (or I2) is the same for all paths.
A quartic of the second kind has the property that it lies on one quadric. To 
determine the equation of the latter we may proceed as follows. From (4.1) we 
deduce that X2+ Y2, X, Y, Z and Z2 can be written as linear functions of

From (4.3) it follows that the unique quadric Q through the path of 
A(x, y, z) is a quadric of revolution; its axis is parallel to Oz.

ex 4- by - az = dj, P = d2, in which d} and d2 are constants, the quadric (4.3) is 
the same. Therefore, although there are paths, the system (4.3) 
represents only ®2 quadrics. In other words, there are sets of ®‘ points of E 
moving on the same quadric. Such a set consists of the points of a conic k, in 
E, determined by d} and d2; there are ®2 such conics. The plane of к is a 
moving plane of E. Characteristic of the Mannheim motion is the property 
that any moving plane passes through a fixed point 5 of 5; for the plane 
ex + by - az = dt this point 5 is seen to be X = - ac2/(b2 + c2), Y = 
- abc/(b2 + c2), Z = - c - dja, hence in view of (4.5) it coincides with the 
center M of the quadric.
Example 22. Verify the coordinates of S.
Any point A (x, y, z) of E determines a pair of constants d{ and d2. If A is 
real the plane ex + by - az = dt and the quadric P = d2 have a real intersec­
tion. This is only the case if g = d] + 2acdi - d2^0.
Example 23. Show that the quadric P = d2 intersects the plane ex + by - az = dt in the curve 
given by (bx-cy/ + g=0 and the plane; hence we have the condition gSO for a real 
intersection.
The quadric Q (4.3) has a real intersection with the plane at 
infinity and it is therefore hyperbolic. Its discriminant D is equal to 
a2(b2 + c2)2(d2- d2-2aedt) = - a2(b2 + c2)2g; this implies that for real mov­
ing points we have D 0. If D >0 the signature of Q is zero, hence Q is a 
hyperboloid of one sheet, with real generators, and the same holds of course 
for P = 0. If g = 0 the quadric Q is a cone, and the conic к degenerates into a 
double line; this line moves so that it passes permanently through the fixed 
point M. The lines with this property are the counterpart of those points 
which under Darboux motion describe a straight line instead of an ellipse.
During a Mannheim motion a moving line generates, in view of Chasles 
theorem of Section 1, a quartic ruled surface. A moving plane envelopes a 
circular cone.
There are some interesting special cases, if a = 0, or b = c = 0, to which we 
shall return in later sections.
5. Schoenflies’ motion
The following motion has been studied at some length by Schoenflies 
[1892]: a plane a of E moves in itself and is also subjected to a translation. If 
a is taken as the o.y-plane (in E) and a plane parallel to it in J as OXYt the 
motion is given by

with three arbitrary functions d, e and /. Any plane parallel to a remains 
parallel to itself. Two points on a line parallel to o, describe congruent paths. 
The instantaneous screw axis is parallel to Oz and to ot. The axodes are 
cylinders with their generators parallel to Oz- They intersect Oxy along two 
curves, the centrodes of the planar part of the motion. Both Darboux’s and 
Mannheim’s motion are special cases and it was in fact Schoenflies

 intention 
to generalize them.
The motion is too special and on the other hand not special enough to be 
very interesting. We shall restrict ourselves to instantaneous kinematics and 
determine how the properties of a general motion are modified for this case. 
We introduce canonical systems for the planar component of the motion and 
suppose that the origins of the spatial frames coincide for ф = 0. Then we 
obtain the following scheme
Xo=x, X,= -y. X2= —x, 
X,= y+d3.......

Yo = y, Y, = x, 
У2 = - у + e2, Y,= - x + e,,...,
Zo — z, Z\ — fi, 
Z2 — fi, 
Zj = fi,... .
If in the expressions (3.4) for the Darboux motion we transform the frames by 
means of
x = y'-a, y=-x', Х=У'-а, У = - X', z = z', Z = Z', 
then omitting the primes we obtain
(53)
X = x cos ф - у sin ф,
У = x sin ф + у cos ф + a (1 - cos ф), 
Z = z + b sin ф + c(l - cos<£);
it is easy to verify that we have now introduced canonical frames. We have

We now derive some instantaneous properties of Schoenflies’ motion, by 
means of (5.2).
The tangent at (x, y, z) to its path is seen to be the line with the coordinates 
p.4=y, p24=-x, pu=-fx, 
P13 = fiy - xz. Pit = - ftX - yz, p,2 = x2 4- У \
Hence the locus of the path tangents reads
(5.8) 
/,(p L 4- pt) 4- p12pM = 0
which represents, for f\ / 0, a tetrahedral complex; which is also the case for 
the general motion in space. This complex is also the locus of tangents for the 
Darboux and the Mannheim motions if 6/0.
The osculating plane at (x, y, z), that is the plane through three consecutive 
positions of the point, is seen to be
Ui = /2x 4-/,y-/,e2, U2= -/ix+/2y, 1/э = x’+y2-e2y, 
(5-9) 
U. = - (x1 + у ‘)(z + /,) + e2yz + e2f,x.
As in the general case this gives us a cubic relationship between the plane and 
the corresponding point.
Example 24. Show that the osculating planes of all points of a plane z • zo pass through one 
point, i.e., through (0, e2, zo + /,).
Example 25. Apply (5.9) to the Darboux motion and show that the osculating plane is the plane 
of the path.
Example 26. Show that the normal plane of the path at (x, y, z) is yX - xY - ftZ + ftz = 0. 
Example 27. Show that the locus of all path normals is a linear complex and determine its 
equation.

is two. This is the case if either x = 
+ /1), у = /?ez/(/? + /2) or w = 0,
x2 + y2 = 0. Hence the inflection curve, a twisted cubic in general, degenerates 
for the Schoenfiies motion into a finite line, “the inflection line” parallel to Oz 
and two imaginary lines at infinity, all three passing through (0,0,1,0). At 
least for the Darboux motion, this degeneration could have been expected: an 
ellipse has an inflection point only if it is a straight line.
Example 28. 
Show that for the Darboux motion the points on the inflection line are those for 
which the path is a line segment.
For general spatial motion the locus in E of the points with a stationary 
osculating plane (that is, points for which four consecutive positions are 
coplanar) is a cubic surface. In our case it follows from (5.2) that its equation is
-у x /,
w -x -y + e2 f2 = 0, 
у + d, - x + e, fy
which implies that it degenerates into the plane at infinity and the circular 
cylinder

another, more formal method which gives us a special motion in a purely 
analytic manner. The general motion in space is expressed by P = Ap + d; 
therefore a special motion is defined any time we specify the matrix A and the 
vector d as functions of a parameter t. To develop this idea we represent the 
orthogonal matrix A by means of the Euler parameters, as was done in 
Chapter VI, (2.1). If N = c} + c? + c\ + d = (d,, d2, d>) and if we put 
d, = 
then any spatial displacement is given, in terms of the
homogeneous coordinates X, Y, Z, W in J and x, y, z, w in E, as
X = [(cj + cj- c}- c?)x +2(ciC2- СоСэ)у -*-2(С|Сч-е  CoC2)z)go + g,w,
Y = [2(с2С| + соСл)х +(ci-c? + c2-c?)y + 2(c2c3- c0Ci)z]g0 + g2w, 
(6Л) z _ [2(c3c, - coc2)x + 2(c3c2 + coCi)y 4- (cj- cf- c2 + c3)z]g0 + g3w,
W = [(Co+c?+c2+cj)w]go.
Hence a spatial motion is defined if we specify c, and g, as functions of t 
(i = 0,1,2,3); go is introduced for the sake of uniformity. The sets c, and g, 
are both homogeneous quadruples of numbers, where the c, are not all zero 
and go/0.
From (6.1) it follows: if c, and g, are algebraic functions of t, the motion is 
algebraic; which means that the path of a point, the ruled surface described by 
a moving line, and the developable generated by a moving plane, are all 
algebraic.
Furthermore, if c, and g, are rational functions of f, all these varieties are 
rational. If g0= 1, g, of degree (i = 1,2,3), c, of degree m2, a path is of 
order max(m,,2m;), Hence, if ль = 2, m2 = 1 any path is a conic, which 
implies that (6.1) represents a Darboux motion.
Example 31. Let c, = c2 = 0, ca = 1, c>e I, g„ = 1. g, ж 0, g2 = 2at, g, = 2Ы + c(l - f2); show (hat 
(6.1) represents the motion (3.4).
If = 4. 
= 2 any path is a rational quartic; this is also the case if ct are
linear, g0 quadratic and g( (i = 1,2,3) quartic functions.

We make use of (6.1) to define a cubic motion, all paths being rational cubic 
curves. Such a motion appears obviously if c, and g0 are linear and g, cubic 
functions of /, (i = 1,2,3). To give an example we put c0 = c3 = 0, Ci = 1. c2 = r, 
go= 1, gi = Л g2 = Л gj = 1, which gives us the following cubic motion

Example 33. Show that (6.2) has the following properties: it is a Schoenflies motion ; the fixed and 
the moving axode are cylinders of order seven and six respectively; the path of (x, y, z) is a twisted 
cubic unless x = 0; if x = 0, w/0, the path is a cubic in the plane w У + (2y + w)Z- 
(y - z w)W = 0; the inverse motion is a quintic motion.
7. Line-symmetric motions
Any displacement of the space E with respect to the coinciding space J is, 
as we know, either a screw displacement, with axis 1, rotation angle ф, and a 
translation d parallel to 1, or as a special case a pure translation. In the first 
case the inverse displacement is the screw displacement with axis 1, rotation 
angle - ф, and a translation - d parallel to 1. Hence the two displacements 
are the same if and only if ф = - <£(mod. 2тг) and d = 0, which (apart from 
the trivial case ф = 0) implies ф = ir; if the direct displacement is a 
translation it can never be identical with its inverse. The conclusion is: the 
only displacement which is identical with its inverse is a half-turn about a line 
1, or in other words the reflection into the line 1. Such a displacement will be 
called symmetric; it is the starting point for a class of special motions to be 
studied in this section.
Analytically a displacement is given by P = Ap 4- d; the inverse is therefore 
p = A"‘(P - d). Hence a symmetric displacement satisfies the equations
(7.1)
A’1 = A, A",<f + d = 0.
A being an orthogonal matrix satisfies A'1 = Ar; hence the first equation (7.1) 
implies that A is a symmetric matrix. Making use again of Chapter VI, (2.1), 
which expresses an orthogonal matrix by means of the parameters c, 
(i = 0,1,2,3) it follows immediately that it is only symmetric if c0 = 0; this is as 
expected in view of the geometric meaning of this parameter: c0 = cosJ</>; 
hence cn = 0 characterizes the half-turns. Symmetric orthogonal matrices 
depend therefore on cbc2, c3; these parameters have also a geometric 
meaning: they are the direction numbers of the axis In of the rotation 
represented by A. As they are homogeneous parameters, not ail zero, we may 
suppose c =(ci,c2, c3) to be a unit vector: c?+c2 + c5 = 1. This implies that

c\- c} = 2cJ- 1, etc. Hence, in view of Chapter VI, (2.1) the half-turn 
about the axis c through О is given by P = 2(c • p)c - p.
We know that the product of a rotation about an axis U and the translation d 
is a pure rotation (about the axis I, parallel to U) if and only if d is orthogonal 
to l0. A vector d orthogonal to c can always be written as с x b, b being an 
arbitrary vector. But as с x (b + kc) = с x b, we may without loss of general­
ity suppose that c • b = 0. Moreover, as the rotation about Io is a half-turn, the 
line 1 passes through \d (Fig. 76); the first Pliicker vector of I is c, if the second 
is b we have b = c x id and therefore d = 2(b x c). Summing up we obtain: 
the half-turn about the line 1, determined by its Pliicker vectors (c, b) is 
represented by
(7.2) 
P = 2(c • p)c - p + 2(b x <?).
Example 34. Verify that (7.2) satisfies the conditions (7.1).

If we expand in terms of coordinates, (7.2) is seen to be

Y == 2c2CiX 4- (2c?- l)y 4- 2c2c3z + 2(b3Ct - 6tc3),

with c? 4- cl + с? = 1, Ctbi 4- c2b2 4- Cyby = 0; (7.3) is the general expression of a 
symmetric displacement.
Example 35. Show that there are symmetric displacements.
We have preferred to derive (7.2) and (7.3) in a way that exhibits the 
connection with the Euler parameters. A more elementary method would be 
to start from a line 1 with Pliicker vectors (c, b) and to calculate the reflection 
(X, У, Z) into 1 of a point (x, y, z).
Example 36. Derive (7.3) by this latter method.
It is seen from (7.3) that all coefficients of the transformation are quadratic 
functions of the parameters ct and bx. From (7.3), which gives the transforma­
tion of the point coordinates, those of the line and the plane coordinates can 
be derived with the result that the coefficients of both are also quadratic 
functions of сх and bt.
Example 37. Verify this statement by calculating the corresponding two matrices, making use of 
the two relations for c, and b,.
Let a frame OXYz be given in the fixed space J and let Eo be that position 
of the moving space E, with the frame ожуж, at which the two frames coincide. 
Let also be given, in X, a continuous set of lines l(t), determined by their 
vectors c(f), b(f); the locus of these lines is a certain ruled surface R'. 
Reflecting Eo into the line l(r) yields E(t). If t varies, a continuous set of 
positions of E with respect to 2 appears and we have defined a certain 
motion of E. Such a motion, completely determined by the ruled surface R' 
will be called a (line-) symmetric motion or a Krames-motion; R' is its basic 
surface.
It has a remarkable property: E(t) is obtained by reflecting Eo into l(r), or 
what is the same thing, by reflecting S into I(r). Hence at any moment the 
positions of E and £ are one anothers’ reflections into a line. But this means 
that the two spaces are interchangable and that the inverse motion is 
characterized by a series of positions of 1 each determined by reflecting 2 
into a line of E. The locus of these lines is obtained as follows: reflect each line

of R' into the line l(f0) of R' then we get a ruled surface R in E, congruent to 
R'. Under the direct motion R, fixed in E, moves in 1. Obviously R and R' 
have at any moment a line in common, l(f0) at the moment t„. The tangent 
plane a to R' at a point В (on the common line) has as its reflection the 
tangent plane at В to R, and since the plane a passes through l(frt) it is 
invariant under the reflection, which implies that, at any moment, R and R' 
are raccording along their common line.
The relation between E and £ has the consequence that any property of 
the direct motion has its counterpart for the inverse motion. So, for instance, 
the set of all paths in £ is the reflection of the set of paths in E. Especially, the 
fixed and moving axodes are, at any moment, one anothers’ reflection; they 
are congruent surfaces.
These axodes may be determined as follows. The instantaneous screw axis 
for the moment t is the limit, as Дг —► 0, of the screw axis for the displacement 
E(f)—► E(f + Af). This displacement takes place by the reflection into 1(f) 
being followed by that into l(f + Д/). The construction for the resultant of two 
displacements has been dealt with in Chapter IV. If it is applied to two 
half-turns it is easily seen that the axis of the product displacement coincides 
with the common perpendicular of the two half-turn axes. Hence the 
instantaneous screw axis s' at the instant t is the common perpendicular of 1(f) 
and the consecutive generator of R', a line called the central line of 1(f) on the 
ruled surface; its intersection with 1(f) is the central point (or striction point) 
on 1(f). The result is: the fixed axode A' is the ruled surface composed of the 
central lines of R'; the moving axode A is the analog figure of R. A moves 
with respect to A' in the well-known rolling-sliding manner described in 
Chapter VI, Section 5; any point of s (the generator of A, coinciding with s') 
has its velocity along s'. A and A' are reflections with respect to I; s and s' 
coincide because they are perpendicular to 1. The motion of R with respect to 
R' is not a rolling-sliding motion.
A Krames motion is determined by its basic surface R' hence by the 
functions c(f), b(t). From (7.3) it follows that the motion is algebraic if R' is 
algebraic. Moreover: if the order of R' is n, then (in general) the paths are 
curves of order 2n, a moving line generates a ruled surface of order 2n, a 
moving plane describes a developable of class 2n.
The motions under consideration have been studied at length, in a series of 
papers by Krames, who has given many applications of the general theory. 
His examples are of two kinds. In some cases he recognized that certain 
known motions belong to the class of line-symmetric ones and he determined 
the basic surfaces R' by which they can be generated. In other cases he started

from a chosen basic surface and in this way he found some interesting special 
motions.
Here, we will give a brief discussion of some special Kramcs motions, many 
more particulars can be found in the original papers (Krames [1937 a-f, 
1940]).
The general Darboux motion is given by (3.4); its axodes are circular 
cylinders with diameters a and 2a. Since a Krames motion has congruent 
axodes, a Darboux motion can obviously only be line-symmetric if the 
parameter a is zero. Then it follows from (3.4) that the motion is the result of 
a rotation about the Z-axis and a harmonic translation, with the same period, 
in the Oz-direction. This special case will be called a vertical Darboux motion 
(German: aufrechte Ellipsenbewegung, or volkommen steiler Darbouxscher 
Umschwung). The remaining parameters are b and c, but in this special case 
by a suitable rotation of the frame o9„ about o, and a certain translation in 
the o, direction we can have c vanish. The motion is then represented by
X = x cos ф - у sin ф,
(7.4) 
Y = x sin ф 4- у cos ф,
Z = z + h sin ф.
Example 38. Show that the foregoing transformation of coordinates yields (7.4) if the rotation 
angle is arctan(- Ь/c). the translation distance c, and h = (b2 + c2)in.
Example 39. Show that a vertical Darboux motion is a (special) Mannheim motion; any moving 
plane envelopes a circular cone.
Example 40. Show that the points whose paths are straight lines are those of o,.
Example 41. Show that the ellipses described by the points of E ail have the same (linear) 
eccentricity Л.
The formulas (7.3) give us the position of the point (x, y, z) of E(, when this 
space is reflected into the line (c, b). If c and b are functions of a parameter t 
these lines are the generators of the basic surface R'. Suppose that for t = 0 
the line coincides with Ox; then for t = 0 we have X = x, Y = - y, Z = - z. 
Hence if we reflect the у and z axes about o, the OXyz and frames 
coincide at t = 0, and the Krames motion may be written as
X - (2c2\- l)x - 2ctc2y - 2cxCiZ + 2(b2c3 - b3c2),
(7.5) 
Y « 2cxc2x + (1 - 2c2)y - 2c2c2z + 2(b3Ci - biC>),
Z = 2c3C]X - 2c3c2y 4- (1 - 2c\)z 4- 2(bxc2 - b2cx).
To demonstrate that the vertical Darboux motion is a Krames motion we 
must show that c and b in (7.5) can be chosen as functions of a parameter in 
such a way that the formulas (7.5) are identical with (7.4). This implies

Ci = cos(<£/2), c2 = sin(</>/2), c3 = 0, b3 = 0, 2(b}c2 - b2Ci) = h sin ф. Keeping 
in mind that b|Ci+b2c2 = 0 we obtain bt = h sin2(4>/2)cos(<b/2), b2 - 
- h sin(</>/2)cos2(<£/2). Hence, putting tan(<f>/2)=t and factoring the term 
cos’(<b/2) from each component, the surface R' is given by
(7.6)
c, = l + /2, c2=/(l + f2), c3 = 0,
b, = ht2, b2=-ht, b3 = 0,
from which it follows that it is a cubic surface. To determine its equation we 
note that c3 = 0, by = 0 implies that the generators of R' intersect Oz 
orthogonally. For the generator through point X, Y, Z we have ct = X, 
c2 = Y, c3 = 0, bi = YZ, b2 = - XZ, Ьз = 0. Hence, using either the parameter 
t or ф, the surface is known. In terms of ф we have 
(7.7) X = к cos(<b/2), Y = к sin(<b/2), Z = h sin (<b/2)cos(<b/2), 
where к is an arbitrary constant, from which it follows

(X2+ Y2)Z = bXY,
which is the standard equation for a well-known surface: Cayley’s cylindroid, 
also called Pliicker’s conoid. The conclusion is: the vertical Darboux motion is 
the Krames motion with a cylindroid as its basic surface.
Example 42. If an arbitrary point is reflected into the generators of R' we obtain the path of its 
motion. Show that the pedal curve of any point with respect to a cylindroid is an ellipse. (A 
theorem due to Appell (1900).)
The axodes of a Schoenflies motion are two cylinders with parallel 
generators. Such a motion can only be line-symmetric if the cylinders are 
congruent. As an example we consider the case when they are both circular 
cylinders with radius p, externally tangent during the motion. Then for 
suitably chosen frames the motion is represented by
(7.9)
X = x cos ф - у sin ф - 2p sin(<b/2), 
Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + 2p cos(<f>/2), 
Z - z + 2g(</>),
Я(Ф) being an arbitrary function.
If we compare (7.9) with (7.5) we obtain for the generators c, b of the basic 
surface R'

Example 44 Consider the case g(4>) = a sin(4>/2). Show that; the equation of R' reads 
(X2 + Y*)Z
2 + 2paXZ - a2 Y2 + p2 a2 = 0; the path of a point is in general a rational quartic; the 
paths of points on o, are circles; the intersection of R’ and a plane Z « h consists of the line 
Z = ^ = 0 at infinity and of two generators of R' which intersect at a point of the hyperbola 
Y = 0, XZ + pa = 0 which is the double curve of R'. Consider the case p « 0.
We define now a (line-symmetric) motion starting from a given basic 
surface R'. As an example we take R' to be a hyperbolic paraboloid with the 
standard equation (X2/a2)-(Y2/b2) = 2Z/c. One of the two systems of 
generators on R' is determined by (X/a) + (Y/b) = 2t~'Z/c, (X/a)~ (Y/b) = 
r; all these generators are parallel to the plane bX - aY = 0. Their Pliicker 
coordinates are seen to be
pu = 2a, 
p24 = 2b, 
p„ = 2ct,
= bef2, pn = ad2, P'2= ~2abt.
If we substitute this in (7.3), keeping in mind that ct, c2, c3; bb b2, by are 
proportional to (7.11), and that Sc2=l, we obtain for the motion, in 
homogeneous coordinates,
X = (a2 - b2 - c2t2)x + 2aby 4- 2actz + at (2b2 4- c2t2)w,
Y = 2abx + (- a2 + b2 ~ c2t2)y 4- 2bctz - bf(2a2 4- c2t2)w,

W = (a3 + b3 + c!l3)w.
The formulas (7.12) represent a cubic motion. The paths are in general twisted 
cubics. The points at infinity of a path follow from W = 0, which gives us 
either t = & or c2t2 = - (a2 + b2). For any x, y, z, w we have: for t = <® the real 
points X = a, Y = - b, Z = VV = 0; for c2t2 = - (a2 4- b2) two imaginary 
points at infinity, these lie at the intersection of bX - aY = 0 and 
X24- Y2 + Z2 = 0.
Example 45. Verify the latter statements by direct substitution of t into (7.12).
This implies that the two imaginary points at infinity of a path are isotropic 
points. Hence the paths are, metrically, special twisted cubics, often called 
cubical circles. Moreover the three points at infinity of a path are the same for 
all paths.
Example 46. Determine the path of a point in the plane at infinity.

The fixed axode of the motion is in general the locus of the central tangents 
of the basic surface. The lines (7.11) are all parallel to the plane bX - a Y = 0. 
Hence the central tangents (л, m), being common perpendiculars of consecu­
tive generators, are orthogonal to this plane and their locus is therefore a 
cylinder. We obtain

which implies that the cylinder is quadratic. Moreover there is only one line 
(namely r = «) in the plane at infinity. The conclusion is: the axodes of the 
Krames motion with a paraboloid as basic surface are parabolic cylinders.

Example 50. Show that there is a line in the moving space the paths of whose points are straight

Example 51. Show that the ruled surface generated by a line moving according to the motion 
(7.12) is of the third order; the direction cone is a circular cone (Krames [1937d. p. 151]).
Bricard [1926] has given a spatial motion such that all point-paths are 
spherical curves; Krames [1937b] has shown that this motion is line- 
symmetric, the basic surface being a spherical conoid. Such a surface is 
defined as the locus of lines which intersect a fixed line orthogonally and 
which are tangent to a fixed sphere.
Let the fixed line be Oz and the equation of the fixed sphere (X - d)2 + 
Y2 + Z2 = p2. A line with the equations X : Y = cos /3 : sin /3, Z = h is seen to 
be tangent to the sphere if h2 = p2 - d2sin2/3, which is the fundamental 
relation between the variables h and /3. The generators (c, b) of the conoid R' 
are
Ct = cos /3, c2 - sin /3, сУ = 0, 
(7’^) 
bi = h sin /3, b2 = ~ h cos /3, by = 0,
Substituting this into (7.5) we obtain the following motion

which is a rotation about Oz combined with a periodic translation parallel to 
Oz, defined by h2 = p2 ~ d2sin' 0. From (7.15) it follows that
X2 4- Y2 4- Z2 = x2 + у2 + z2 4- 4hz + 4/12.
We have 2h - Z - z \ moreover h2 = p2 - d2(l - cos2/3)/2, and Xx 4- Yy = 
(x2 4-у 2)cos 2/3. Hence we obtain

X2 4- Y2 4-Z2- (2d2/(x2 + у2))(Xx 4- Yy) 
-2zZ-x2-y2 + z2-2(2p2- d2) = 0,
which shows that any point (x, y, z) remains, during the motion, on a sphere: 
every path is a spherical curve.
The center M of the sphere is given by 
(7.17) XM = d2x/(x2 4-y2), YM = d2y/(x2+y2), ZM = z.
Example 52. Show that M follows from (x, y, z) by an inversion with respect to ot.
Example 53. Determine the radius of the sphere; it is independent of z.
Example 54. Show that there is a cubic relationship between the moving point and the center M.
From (7.15) we have moreover X2 4- Y2 = x2 4- y2; this implies that the path 
of a moving point is the intersection of the sphere and a circular cylinder. The 
paths are therefore in general biquadratic curves of the first kind. In contrast 
to the preceding examples, the Bricard motion is not rational: it is of genus 
one.
Example 55. The motion (7.15) can be described by elliptic functions. If d < p. к = dip. then by 
means of Jacobi functions with modulus к we obtain
X = x( 1 - 2snJr)~ 2y snf ent, У = 2x sntent + y(l - 2snJt), 
Z = z 4- 2p dn i.
In the special case d = p (that is if the sphere of the conoid is tangent to 
Oz) the motion is rational; we have h = pcos/3; the paths are rational 
biquadratic curves of the first kind.
Example 56. For this case, write (7.5) in a rational form. Determine the double point of the 
general path; show that all the points pass through the node of their path simultaneously.
The axodes of the Bricard motion are trivial; they consist of the Oz and the 
ot axis respectively.
Example 57. Determine the order of the surface generated by a moving line and the class of the

basic surface R' consists of one of the systems of generators on a hyperboloid 
H. It will be seen to be the so-called Bennett motion. Let the equation of H be
(7.18) 
(X7a2) + (K7b2)-(Z7c2)= 
a2-b2^0.
One set of generators is given by
b(cX - aZ)-tacfbW - Y) = 0, tb(cX + aZ)- ac(bW 4- Y) = 0.
From this it follows that the PKicker coordinates of a generator are 
pI4=a(t2-l), 
p24= -2Ы, 
-c(t2+l)9

Example 58. 
Show that the set of lines is the intersection of the three linear complexes 
bcp M - opn = 0, acp24 - bpyt = 0, abpM + cpt2 = 0.
Example 59.

- b sin <f>. pM = “ с, p„ = be соьф, p„ - - ac sin ф. p,2 = ab.
If we substitute (7.19) into (7.3) we obtain the Bennett motion
X = [(a2 - c2)/4 - 2(a2 4- 2b2 4- c2)t2 + (a2- c2))x
-4abt(j2- l)y -2ac(r4- l)z + 4a(b2 + c2)t(t2 + l)w,

W = [(a2 + c2)tA 4- 2( - a2 + 2b2 4- c2)t2 + (a2 4- c2)]w.
A first conclusion is: the paths of the motion are in general twisted quartics of 
the second kind. Further properties follow from the circumstance that the set 
(7.19) contains four isotropic lines. Indeed the conic at infinity of H (7.18) has 
four intersections with the isotropic conic O. They are seen to be

J\ and JI are conjugate imaginary points and so are J2, JJ. Through each point 
J there passes one generator of the set (7.19); we shall denote them by 
1ь Ik LIJ respectively. We know that the reflection into an isotropic line 1 (with 
its point at infinity J on fl) is a singular displacement: it transforms an 
arbitrary point into J; furthermore a point P in the isotropic plane through I is 
transformed into all points of the line PJ. Applying this to the motion under 
consideration we obtain: all paths pass through the four points (7.21); the 
paths are circular curves and their isotropic points are the same for all paths.
Let ab at,az,aj be the isotropic planes through 1ь IJ, l2, 1J respectively. Then 
the path of a point P in at, say, contains the line PJ\\ it degenerates into this 
line and a twisted cubic (passing through /2). More interesting still is the 
path of a point on the intersection of two planes a; obviously it degenerates 
into two isotropic lines and a conic. The latter passes through the two 
remaining isotropic points and it is therefore a circle. The four planes a give 
rise to six intersections, the edges of the tetrahedron of which the a*s
 are the 
faces. As two conjugate imaginary planes have a real intersection we obtain: 
there are two skew lines in E, the intersection mi of abaj and the intersection 
m2 of a2, a2, with the property that the path of any point on mi or m2 is a circle.
The line h passes through Л; its first Pliicker vector is therefore 
(iaq2, bqi, cq3) and hence according to (7.19) the second reads (ibcq2, acqb 
- abq^\ it follows that h passes through (aqt, - ibq2,09q3). The tangent at Ji 
to О is iaq2X + bq^Y + cq,Z = W = 0; this implies that the plane on through lt 
and this tangent has the equation
iaq2X + bqtY + cqyZ - iqiq2qiVV = 0.
For mt in У we obtain therefore
(7.23) 
aX-q>qyW = 0, bq>Y + cq)Z = 0,
and analogously for mJ:
(7.24) 
aX + q^W = 0, bq> Y - cq.Z = 0.
In the original position of E its frame coincides with that of 2. Hence the 
two special lines m(, m2 in E follow from (7.23) and (7.24) by replacing 
X, KZ, W by x,y,z,w.
mt and m2 intersect ot orthogonally at the points (^3,0,0,a) and 
(-^1^3.0,0, a); their distance is 2^i^j/a; if у is their angle then tan(y/2) =

line J2J'2. The pole of this line with respect to Q is, however, the point at 
infinity of the line m2. Hence the parallel planes are perpendicular to mJ.
Let M be the center of the circle described by the point P, on mb Then the 
distance MP, is constant during the motion. Hence, during the inverse motion 
M describes a circle with center P,. Since the motion is line-symmetric the 
inverse motion is congruent with the direct motion. The conclusion is that M 
is on mi, for during the inverse motion a point of mi describes a circle in a 
plane perpendicular to m>. Summing up, the Bennett motion has the following 
property. In E there exist a pair of skew lines mi,m3 and in 2 a pair mJ, mi 
such that the figure m'b mi is congruent with mbm2. During the motion any 
point on mt describes a circle, in a plane perpendicular to mi, with center on 
mi; a point on m2 describes a circle, in a plane perpendicular to mi, and with 
its center on m't.
It follows from (7.21) that the equation of J2, Ji reads cqyY 4- bq,Z = W = 
0. Hence the planes of the paths of points on mi are parallel to the plane 
cq

 + bq,Z =0, which is indeed perpendicular to mi, given by (7.24). An 
arbitrary point P, on mf is obtained from (7.23): x = q^q^ у = Acq5, z = 
- Abq,, w = a. Its positions during the motion follow from (7.20). For t = 0 it 
is seen to be
X = (a2-c2)q,qy-2abcAq,4 Y = - (a2-*-  c2)Acqy-2ab(a2 + c2),
Z = 2acq+ (a: - c2)Abqh W = (a2 + c2)a,
which is a point on the path of Pt. Hence the plane of this path is 
cq^Y + bq,Z 4- Aa(c2 - b2)W = 0. This plane’s intersection with mi, that is the 
center of the path of Pb reads X = - q,qy(b2 + c2), Y = Acq>(b2-c2\ Z = 
Abq^-c2), W = a(b2 + c2).
Example 60. Show (hat the line m, (mj generates a hyperboloid of revolution with mi (m’t) as

The fixed axode of the motion is the locus of the common perpendiculars of 
two consecutive generators of the hyperboloid H, given by (7.19). It is a 
rational ruled surface of the sixth order.
Example 61. Prove the latter statement.
We have considered the Bennett motion as a special case of a line- 
symmetric motion. It was derived by Bennett [1913] in terms of a certain 
mechanism for which two moving points describe circles. Although the 
motion has been studied by several geometers, it was Krames [1937e] who 
recognized it as a symmetric motion with a hyperboloid as basic surface. 
Groeneveld [1954] has written a monograph on this motion.

PLANESYMMETRIC MOTIONS

8. Plane-symmetric motions
In the preceding section we defined a class of special motions by consider­
ing the series of positions of the space En when it is reflected into a set of lines 
in X. We deal now with an analogous procedure. Let a continuous set of 
planes U(r) be given in X; Ert coincides with X (provided we let frame 
coincide with OXyz)- If Eo is reflected into the planes U(r) of the developable 
we obtain a series of positions E(t). There is, however, a fundamental 
difference from the former construction. If we reflect a space into a line we 
obtain a congruent space, if we reflect into a plane the transformed space is 
symmetric with the original but it has the opposite orientation. However, if 
we change the orientation of E(/), by putting x = - x, у = -у, z - - z, the 
set of positions do define a motion of E with respect to X. We shall call it a 
plane-symmetric motion; U(f) is its basic developable.
If U, are the coordinates of a plane U, with U2 4- U22 4- U*
 = 1, it is easy to 
derive that the reflection of a point x, y, z into U has the coordinates 
x'H“ U2t + U1 + U5)x— 2UtU2y-2U'U>z -2UAK and so on for y' and 
z' by cyclic substitution. Hence, omitting the bars, we obtain for the general 
plane-symmetric motion
X = (2LTJ- l)x ^2UtU2y +2UyUyZ -2UJJ^
(8.1) 
У = 2U2UiX + (2U22-l)y + 2U2UyZ - 2U2U^
Z = 2l/3t/,x + 2UyU2y + (2UI - \)z - 2U,U4.
If we compare this with Chapter III, (12.12) we see that the motion which 
transforms Eo into E(r) is a screw motion with its rotation equal to a half-turn 
about the axis (t/ь t/2, Uy) through O, and its translation, parallel to this axis, 
equal to -2U
*.
 We are interested, however, in the displacement which 
carries E(h) into E(h). If we reflect E(L) into U(L) we obtain En which when 
reflected into U(r2) yields E(t2). Hence, this displacement is the product of the 
reflection into U(L) followed by that into U(f2). The product of two plane 
reflections is obviously a rotation about the intersection of the two planes (or 
a translation if the planes are parallel). The conclusion is: if E has a 
plane-symmetric motion any position follows from any other by a rotation 
(and not a screw-displacement as in the general case). This is especially the 
case for two consecutive positions; hence the instantaneous screw is at any 
instant a pure rotation. Its axis is the intersection of two consecutive planes of 
the developable generated by U(t). Therefore, the fixed axode is the surface 
of the tangents to the curve associated with the developable. Hence the axode

[CH. 9. §9
is a developable ruled surface, which also follows from the fact that the pitch 
of the instantaneous screw, and hence the distribution parameter of the 
axode, is zero. Furthermore the moving axode is obvious obtained by 
reflecting the fixed axode into a plane of the developable U(f).
Example 62. Show that the inverse motion of (8.1) is obtained by interchanging 
X, Y, Z, Ut, U  Uy, U4, x, y, z with x. y. z. Ut, U„ Uy, - U4, X, Y, Z.
*
If the basic developable consists of parallel planes the motion is a 
translation; if the planes pass through a line 1 the motion consists of the 
rotation about 1. A quadratic developable is a quadratic cone (this is the dual 
theorem of: a quadratic curve is a plane curve); if the developable is (any) 
cone the motion has a fixed point and it is therefore spherical.
To discuss a non-trivial example of a plane-symmetric motion we choose as 
basic developable the set of osculating planes of the cubic parabola X = t1, 
Y = t\ Z = t, W = 1. Then we have LA = 1, U2 = - 3/, U3 = U4 = - t\ 
For (8.1) we obtain, since U} + U} 4- U} = 1 + 9f2 + 9r\
(8.2)
X = (1 - 9t2 - 9r4)x - 6ty + 6t2z + 2t3w,
Y = - 6tx + (- 1 + 9t2 ~ 9f4)y - 18r3z - 6r4w, 
Z = 6t2x - 18f’y + (- 1 - 9t2 4- 9t4)z 4- 6r5w, 
W = (1 4-9t2 4-9f4)w.
The paths of this motion are rational quintic curves, all passing (at t = <») 
through the point (0,0,1,0) at infinity; the other intersections with W = 0 are 
imaginary. The fixed axode is the surface of the tangents to the cubic 
parabola, which is a (developable) ruled surface of the fourth order.
Example 63. Show that the motion is in general of order 2n if the basic developable is of class n. 
In (8.2) it is diminished by one because the plane at infinity belongs to the developable.

we impose five simple conditions. Such a condition arises for instance if a 
moving point must remain on a given surface of the fixed space. One could 
ask. for instance, for a formula giving the order of a motion if five points of E 
must each remain on an algebraic surface, each having a given order, in £. In 
contrast to the much simpler case of plane kinematics, such a formula does 
not seem to be known. Even for the case where all five surfaces are planes the 
problem is a complicated one since so many cases have to be considered: 
Some planes may be parallel, or parallel to the same line; of the moving 
points three may be on a line or four of them on a plane. Darboux [1897] has 
derived some results for this problem and we shall make some remarks about 
it in Chapter X on л-parameter motion.
Another interesting possibility arises if one prescribes the path of a moving 
point; it is equivalent to two simple conditions. For instance we could study 
the motion at which two points of E are compelled to remain on given curves 
and a third point on a given surface. It seems that no systematic account has 
been developed for such problems. Much work has been done on the motion 
for which two points Ab A2 describe given circles, but obviously these 
conditions do not define a one-parameter motion; the motion of the line 
A । A2, however, is determined in this case and it has been shown that the path 
of a point on it is a curve of order eight. This problem is strongly related to the 
theory of mechanisms (in fact it is a spatial four-bar motion).
10. Special spherical motions
We consider now some special spherical motions. If we specialize the 
examples of spatial motions, dealt with in the preceding sections, to spherical 
motion the results are often trivial. So, for instance, the Darboux motion 
(Section 3) is only spherical if a = b = c = 0, which reduces it to a rotation 
about a fixed axis. The same holds for the Bricard motion (Section 7), which is 
spherical for h = 0.
A general Krames motion is only spherical if the basic surface R' is a cone. 
If its vertex coincides with the origin we have in (7.3) bi = b2 = by = 0. Hence 
we obtain

C| : c2: c3 = a(1 - t2): 2bt : с (1 + t2).
The motion is given by (10.1) with (10.2) substituted into it. The paths are 
quartics of the second kind; the unique quadric defined by each path is the

the path degenerates into the line PJ and a twisted cubic; for a point in two 
such planes the path consists of two lines and a circle. The isotropic planes 
through Ji and intersect in the real line mi with x : у : z = 0: cq3: - bqr, it 
has the property that all points on it describe circles, in planes parallel to

properties. The circles described by points on mi (and, respectively m2) have 
their centers on m2 (or respectively mi). This motion is a limit case of the 
Bennett motion.
Example 65. Verify these properties analytically by means of (10.1) and (10.2).
Example 66. Determine, for a point on mb the plane and the center of its path.
Example 67. Show that the lines m, and m: describe circular cones.
The fixed axode of the motion is the locus of the central tangents of the 
basic cone. An instantaneous axis passes through O, it is normal to two 
consecutive generators and thus to the tangent plane of the cone. Hence the 
fixed axode is determined by X : У : Z = bc(t2- 1): - 2act: ab(t2 + 1); its 
equation is a2X2 + b2Y2- c2Z2 = 0. The moving axode is congruent with it; 
its positions in 2 are obtained if the fixed axode is reflected into a generator 
of the basic cone. The motion is generated by the rolling of a quadratic cone 
on a congruent one, such that at any moment corresponding generators 
coincide.
Example 68. Show that the path of a point on the moving axode is a twisted quartic of the second 
kind with a cusp.
A plane-symmetric spherical motion arises if the basic developable consists 
of planes through the center of the sphere. The fixed axode is the cone 
enveloped by the developable; the moving axode is a cone, it can be obtained 
from the fixed axode by reflecting it into a plane of the developable.
Example 69. Determine the motion if the basic developable consists of the tangent planes of a 
quadratic cone.

A specific spherical motion is represented by (10.3) if the parameters c, are 
specified functions of t. As there are three degrees of freedom such a motion 
is in general defined by two simple conditions. Hence we can obtain a motion 
by prescribing the paths of two points of the moving space. If A is a point of E 
its path is similar to that of every point on the line OA. We will therefore 
restrict ourselves to points on the same sphere about O.
As an example we suppose that two points AbA2 of E describe circles 
ГЬГ2 on their sphere, with spherical center M, and spherical radius p, 
(i = 1,2). Such a motion is called a spherical coupler motion or a spherical 
four-bar motion, the four “bars" being the arcs M,M2, MiAt, M2A2, A}A2 
which define the motion; AiA2 is called the coupler of the spherical 
quadrilateral M}M2A2Ai.
The condition that, under spherical motion. A, remains on Г, is equivalent 
to the condition that A, remains on the plane U' of Г,. Let the equation of 
be U\X + U2Y + U'yZ + C7'4W =0 and let furthermore At = (x„y6z(). 
Hence, eliminating X, У, Z, W by means of (10.3) we obtain two quadratic 
equations O< = 0, i = 1,2 for the homogeneous unknowns c, \ the coefficients 
depend on the constants UI, x„ y„ z„ In the three dimensional c,-space the two 
conditions represent two quadrics. Their intersection, a quartic space curve у 
of the first kind, is an image of the set of positions of E during the motion.
у is in general a curve of genus one; c, may be written as elliptic functions of 
a parameter. Such functions represent a fourth order curve and as, in view of 
(10.3), the path of an arbitrary point is represented by quadratic functions of ct 
we draw the conclusion: the paths of the spherical coupler motion are curves 
of order eight and genus one.
The motion under consideration is essentially defined by the four bars of 
the quadrilateral; hence there are spherical coupler motions. There is a 
multitude of special cases. First of all there is no motion possible if any bar is 
more than the sum of the remaining three; then the two quadrics have no real 
common point, у is an imaginary curve. Furthermore one (or both) of the 
circles may be great circles; two (or more) bars (adjacent or opposite) may be

equal; a bar may be equal to тг/2; the planes of the circles may be 
perpendicular; the sum of two bars may be equal to that of the other two 
(which implies that there are positions at which the four points A, are on a 
great circle). All these special cases have their counterpart in the behavior of 
the curve y; it may have a double point or it may be degenerate. All this has 
its influence on the set of paths; we already know that even in the general case 
there are points, namely A,, A 2, the paths of which are not of the eighth but of 
the second order; in the special cases the order of the paths of a set of points 
or even of all points may be less than eight.
We restrict ourselves here to these general remarks on the spherical 
coupler motion, a complete discussion of all cases would obviously require an 
elaborate amount of detail.
Example 70. Show that the line-symmetric motion with a quadratic cone as its basic surface 
(treated above) is a special, spherical, coupler motion; the paths are rational quartic curves. 
Example 71. We choose the frame such that M,. M2 ж (cosjg, sin|g,  0) and the frame 
Oay( such that At, A2 s (cosjfc, sin]k,0).  Derive the equations of the quadrics Q».Oj and

IL Special plane motions
There is an extensive literature on plane motions, both from purely 
geometric considerations and from the view point of application to the theory 
of plane mechanisms. Within the scope of this book we restrict ourselves to 
some important examples, for more details one may refer to numerous 
text-books and special papers on the subject.
The Frenet-Serret motion, considered in Section 2, simplifies considerably 
for the planar case. A curve Г being given in the fixed plane 2, the motion is 
defined as follows. The origin of the moving frame ожу has Г as its path and the 
o,-axis rotates so that it always coincides with the tangent to Г. In the 
formulas of Section 2 we have now т = 0.
Example 72. Show that the pole P of the motion coincides with the corresponding center of 
curvature of Г; and that the Darboux screw is a rotation about the perpendicular to the plane, 
through P.
Example 73. Show that any plane motion is a Frenet-Serret motion; for Г we may take any 
evolvent of the fixed centrode (the latter being the evolute of Г).
A line-symmetric plane motion may be defined in the same way as in the 
spatial and the spherical cases, starting from a basic set of lines. In the plane 
case these lines are the set of tangents to a curve in the fixed plane J. But,

there is an essential difference in this case: Confining ourselves to the plane, a 
reflection into a line, lying in the plane, gives us a figure which is symmetric 
with the original one and not congruent as it is in space. (Of course, congruent 
figures result from reflecting about lines normal to the plane, this yields what 
we could consider as planar reflections about a point.) Moreover a reflection 
into a line I of J is the same procedure as the reflection into the plane through 
1 perpendicular to 2. Hence line-symmetry and plane-symmetry are identical 
concepts in the planar case.
If any line 1 of the basic set is represented by its normal equation such a set 
may be given by
(11.1) 
X sin Ф + Y cost/, =
Ь(ф) being an arbitrary function. If the frames in 2 and in the original 
position Ea of the moving plane coincide, the reflection of (x, у) into the line 
(11.1) is seen to be
X = x cos2</r - у sin 2ф + 2/i (ф)sin Ф,
Y = - x sin2t/r - у соь2ф + 2A(^)cos</r,
which transforms Eo into a plane Ё(ф) with the opposite orientation. To 
generate a continuous set of positions with the same orientation as 2 we 
reflect Ё(ф) into a fixed line L of 2; the new set of positions defines a motion 
of E with respect to 2 which is called a symmetric motion.
To derive a standard representation of such a motion we take OXY such that 
for Ф = 0 the line (11.1) coincides with Ox; moreover, let the tangent point (of 
the line (11.1)) with its envelope be the origin. This implies Ao = 0, h} = 0. 
Furthermore let the fixed line L be Ox. The motion is now given by
X = x cos2i/r - у sin 2ф + 2h (ф) sin ф, 
(11^) 
Y = x sin 2ф + у соь2ф - 2Н(ф)со$ф.
The most characteristic property of a symmetric plane motion is that the fixed 
and the moving centrode are symmetric curves with respect to the instantaneous 
common pole tangent.
Example 74. From (11.3) derive that the moving centrode is given by
x = h(<>)sin ф Н'(ф)ссяф, у * Н(ф)со$ф - h'(<^)sin ф.
and the fixed centrode by
X m h(«A)sin ф + h'(<A)cos ф, Y = - Ь(ф)со$ф + h'(0)sin ф.

2h(<//)sin Ф, b = — 2h(</f)cos ф. The general motion is defined by two arbi­
trary functions, a symmetric motion depends on the function Ь(ф) only.
From (11.3) it follows that the frames of E and J are canonic for the 
zero-position Ф = 0. Hence the instantaneous invariants a„, b„ can be calcu­
lated in terms of the numbers hk = dkh(0)/c^k. We obtain

the third if 2a%+ 3b, = 0. to the fourth if moreover a4+26, «0, to the fifth if moreover 
2a, +5b«-562 = 0. (Veldkamp (J9631.)
Example 76. Discuss the symmetric motion if the centrodes are ellipses, each with semi-axes p 
and q. Show that the path of a moving point is in general a rational quartic and determine its three 
double points. Show that the foci of the moving centrode describe circles. Consider the case 
p = q.
A moving plane has three degrees of freedom. Hence a plane motion is in 
general determined if the paths of two points are prescribed. The classical 
example is the four-bar motion, for this case the two given points describe 
circles.
Let the points = 
0), JVf2 = (M,0) in the fixed plane 2 be the
centers of the circles, and R} and R? their radii; let Ai = (-m,0) and 
A2 = (m,0) in E have these circles as their respective paths. The motion will 
only be possible if none of the four bars 2M, 2m, R,, R> is larger than the sum 
of the remaining three. We shall show how the equation of the path of an 
arbitrary point (x, y) of E can be derived.
The motion is given by
(11.5) X = x cos</> - у sin ф + a, Y = x sin ф + у cos<t> 4- b.
We have X(A|) = - m со$ф + a, Y(Aj)= - tn sin ф + b, upon eliminating a 
and b by means of (11.5):
X(Ai) = X - (x + m )cos ф + у sin ф,
У (A,) = Y - у cos ф - (x + tn )sin ф.
The condition that At remains on (Mi; Ri) reads (X(Ai) + Mj2 + [ У(А>)]2 = 
R2i which gives rise to a linear equation for соъф and $тф:

4[Xm + xM] cos ф - 4[yM - Ym ] sin ф = 4[XM + xm ] - (R ? - R2),
from which cost/) and sin ф can be determined. Then using the condition 
cos2 ф + sin20 = 1 we obtain a relation, between (X, Y) and (x, y), which is 
the equation of the path of (x, у ), usually called a coupler curve. From (11.8) it 
is easily seen that the equation remains the same if we interchange X, Y, M 
and x, y, m ; this could be expected because the inverse motion is that of the 
four-bar with fixed centers Ab A2 and the moving bar MXM2.
The equation of the path is too complicated to be of much use but we can at 
least derive from (11.8) that the curve is of order six and, after some algebra, 
that the sixth order terms are (X2+ Y2)’ and that those of the fifth and the 
fourth order have the factors (X2 + Y2)2 and (X2+ Y2) respectively. The 
conclusion is: the coupler curve is a tri-circular sextic. It may be derived 
moreover that the line MtIt is tangent to the curve at Ih with i = 1,2, j = 1,2. 
This means that Mi and M2 are foci of the coupler curve. (They are in fact 
singular foci since the isotropic points I2 are on the coupler curve.)
Another analytic approach to the curve is the following one. Using the 
same coordinate systems, let Z_AtMxO = 0,, LA2M2O = 02, then Ax = 
(- M + Ricos0b R) sin 0|), A2 = (M - R2cos02, R2sin 02). The condition

A position of the coupler plane E undergoing a four-bar motion is deter­
mined by a pair (0b 02) satisfying (11.9); hence a position is mapped as a point 
of the (image) curve k, in the (u, v, w)-plane, given by equation (11.10). 
Obviously к is a quartic curve with the double points B| = (1,0,0) and 
B2 = (0,1,0). It has in general no other double points, which means that к is a 
curve of genus one, an elliptic curve, the coordinates of whose points may be 
expressed by elliptic functions of a parameter t.
This shows that the general four-bar motion is an elliptic motion and that its 
paths are in general curves of genus one. The double points and B2 of к do 
not correspond to positions of E. Other special points of к are those for which 
(u2 + w2X^2 + w2) = 0, this equation represents four lines, two through Bt and 
two through B2. They also intersect к at six other points, which are conjugate 
imaginary in pairs, namely Ch Cl = (1, - 1, ± i), C2, C2 = [Rt - g, - (R, + g), 
± i(R, + g)J, C3, Ci = [R2- g, - (R2 + g), ± i(Ri - g)].

Z = (u2+iv2Xt)2+ w2)zf
with the condition that u, v, w satisfy (11.10).
The intersection of a path with the line at infinity is given by 
(u2+ w2Xu2 + w2) = 0; hence a moving point is at infinity at the six positions 
corresponding to the points Ch C'i(j = 1,2,3) on the image curve k. For these 
singular positions all points of E are transformed into the isotropic points 
Zi, I2 of 2. We have by this once more shown that the path is a tricircular 
sextic, and moreover that its genus is one.

A remarkable, although somewhat isolated, theorem on the coupler curve 
was given by S. Roberts (1875]. Let M}AyA2M2 be a four-bar and A a 
specified point in the moving plane (Fig. 78). We construct the parallelograms 
M\AiAA \ and AA2M2A2, the triangles A\AGi and AA2G2 both similar to 
AjA2A, and then the parallelogram GyAG2M3. We make use of planar 
vector-algebra, or what is the same thing, complex numbers. If we let 
MtM2 = po, MtAi = p2, AjA2 = pb A2M2 = p3, A|A = p, Z.A2AiA = a, then 
P = (р/р«)е“*Р1,  A !Gi = (p/pi)e^p2, AG2 = (p/p\)c^p3. From this it follows 
that M = My A J + A IGi + GyM3 = (plp^ipi + p2 + p3) = (p/pi^po.

Hence My is a fixed point, independent of the position of the four-bar; it 
follows furthermore that the vertex My is located so that triangle MiM2My is 
similar to the “coupler-triangle” AiA2A. A consequence is that the path of A 
for the four-bar motion of MXA\A2M2 coincides with its path under two other 
four-bar motions, namely M2A2G2M3 and MjGiA'iMi, the three motions 
being equivalent only with respect to the coupler curve described by A. We 
knew that Mb M2 are foci of the curve, My is now seen to be the third one.
Two (or more) motions of the plane E such that for a certain point of E the 
paths coincide are called path-cognate motions.
A non-degenerate curve of order n has at most $(л-1)(п-2) double 
points; for n - 6 this number is 10. The coupler curve has genus one, hence it 
has 9 double points, h and I2 being three-fold points count for three double 
points each. This implies that the curve has three finite double points. Let D 
be a double point of the path of A. Point A is taken as the third vertex of the 
coupler triangle AXA2A, and zLAfAA2 = у is its vertex angle. Since D is a 
double point there are two positions of this triangle with the same vertex D, 
say A!A 2D and А TA 2D (Fig. 79). It is always possible to think of the second 
following from the first position by a rotation about D, with angle As

the coupler triangle (or тг - у if the figure is slightly different). As Z_MjDM2 =
the conclusion is: D is on the circumcircle of
This circle has 12 intersections with the coupler curve, of which six are such 
that three each coincide with /1, I2. The six finite intersections are therefore 
the three double points, each counted twice.
The coupler curve has been the subject of many geometric investigations. 
The configuration of the points Mh M2, and the three double points 
Di.D2.Di, all on the same circle, has remarkable properties: any D is 
isogonally conjugate, with respect to the triangle 
to the point at
infinity of the join of the other two (Cayley’s theorem, Cayley (1875]); the 
same statement holds if M, and D, are interchanged. The points D can be all 
real or two of them are imaginary. The points in E whose paths belong to the 
first category are separated from the others by a transition curve of the tenth 
order (Muller [1889]); the points on this curve have a path with a “self­
contact point”. If a double point is real it can be a node or a cusp or an 
isolated point. The locus of the points describing a path with a cusp is the 
moving centrode, a curve of order eight, too complicated to clarify the 
motion. There are curves, found by Alt ([1921], Bottema [1954]) for which 
the double points coincide with the foci. Mayer [1937] has investigated

coupler curves with three cusps. Other constructions to generate a coupler 
curve have been given by Hippisley ([1920]) and by Weiss ([1942]). The curve 
has been treated by means of so-called isotropic coordinates by Haar 
bleicher ([1933]) and by Groenman ([1950]).
Example 78. Consider the path of a point A on A >A; and show that it has three collinear double 
points.
The positions of the moving plane of the four-bar motion have been 
mapped on the image curve к (11.10), a quartic of genus one. Its equation 
depends on S, and T,. For a real four-bar we have S, >0 (i = 1,2,3,4) and 
7\>0, but Ti, T2, Ti can have different signs, from which follow various 
shapes of к and therefore of the paths of the motion. Special cases arise if one 
T is zero, and still more special cases if two of them are zero. If one T is zero 
the four-bar has the property that the sum of two bars is equal to that of the 
other two, which implies that there are positions at which М», M2, Ai, A2 are 
collinear: the four-bar is said to fold (or be stretchable).
Example 79. Show that for T, = 0 the image curve к (11.10) has a self-contact at Bt (which is the 
equivalent of two coinciding double points); represents a position of the four-bar in this case. 
For Tie 0 we have analogous properties of B2. For = 0 the point (0,0.1) is a double point. In 
all three cases the image curve, the motion and therefore all paths are rational.
Example 80. Consider the cases T3 = Т» e 0, 
« T, - 0, T, = T2 ° 0; in all three the image
curve degenerates and so does every path. The four-bar is doubly stretchable.
Other special cases of the four-bar motion arise if, for instance, R2 = one 
point of E describes a circle, another a straight line. The motion is the 
slider-crank motion (Fig. 80).
Let (M,;R,) be the circle X2 + Y2 - R 2 = 0, and the line X - d = 0. If 
A। = (0,0) and A2 = (k,0) we obtain the relations X2(Ai) + Y2(Ai)- R2 = 0, 
X(A2) = d. Hence by means of X = x cos</> - у sin ф + a, Y =

Example 85. Show that the point-paths of this inverse motion are in general tri-circular sex tics.
Another analytic approach to the slider-crank motion makes use of an 
image-curve. Let (Fig. 80) A> = (R cos0, R sin 0), A2 = (d. Rv). Then if 
tanj0 = u, the condition that (AiA2)2=k2 yields the following relation 
(between и and u):
R2u2v2 + (R + d + k)(R + d - k)u2 + R2v2
-4R2uv + (R-d + k)(R-d-k) = 0.
It represents the general image curve (11.10) for the special case at hand. 
(11.17) is a quartic of genus one, with the double points (1,0,0) and (0,1.0). 
Hence the slider-crank motion is elliptic; its paths are in general quartics of 
genus one. and therefore they have two double points.
Example 86. Consider the special cases of the folding slider-crank (R + d - к =0, etc.).
Roberts’ configuration (Fig. 78) specializes for the slider-crank motion. M2 
is now the point at infinity of Ox. As the triangles 
and A,A2A are
similar, is also at infinity and so are A2 and G2\ but At and Gt are still 
finite points (Fig. 81). The path of A as a coupler point of the original 
slider-crank is the same as its path under the slider-crank motion defined by 
MiAJGiAfb (A being the vertex of the coupler triangle AIGiA); A J 
describes the circle with center and Gj the straight line perpendicular to 
G.M,.
Example 87. Show that the “circumcircle” of 
is a straight line through M(; determine
its direction and prove that the (two) double points of the path of A are on it (this can be done 
either analytically or by means of a construction analogous to Fig. 78).
For the inverse motion a line 1 of E passes through a fixed point A' of 1 
and a point A, of E remains on a circle in 2. A special case appears if this 
circle is a straight line Г. This motion is obviously self-inverse (and it can still 
be considered as a limit case of the four-bar motion). It is called a conchoid 
motion because of the shape of its path.
Let A, be x = y= 0, A':X=Y = 0, l:X-d = 0, Г :X-D=0. Introduc­
ing the conditions that 1 passes through A’ and Ai remains on 1'; then 
eliminating a and b as we did before, we obtain two linear equations for cos ф 
and sin ф :
X cos ф + Y sin ф + (d - x) = 0,
x cos ф - у sin ф + (D - X) » 0.

which represents a circular quartic, called a conchoid. 
Example 88. Show analytically that the motion is self-inverse in the sense that the equation 
remains the same if X, Y, D are interchanged with x, y, d.

A still more special four-bar motion, called Cardan or Cardanic motion 
after Geronimo Cardano, is that for which two points of E are compelled to 
remain on two straight lines of X. It is trivial if these lines are parallel. We 
take them perpendicular and will show that this covers the general case as 
well.

for the equation of the path of (x, у). This represents in general an ellipse with

equation reads (X sin - Y cos|0)
*

A у A 2 as diameter remains on a line through O. This justifies our having taken 
two perpendicular lines to describe the motion. The only point of E whose 
path is a circle is the origin о (the midpoint of Ab A2); its radius is R. The 
Cardan motion is often called the elliptic motion.
The formulas (11.18) may be written:
X = x cos ф - у sin ф + R cos ф, 
1’20) 
Y = x sin ф + у cos ф - R sin ф.
Hence X = Y = 0 implies for the pole P
(11.21) 
x, = Rcos2<k yp- -Ksin2<fc
and
(11.22) 
Xp = 2Kcos$, Yp = -2R sin ф.
The moving centrode is the circle (o ; R), the fixed centrode is (О;2Я). A 
Cardan motion is generated by the rolling of any circle within a circle with 
twice its radius. The path of a point on the moving centrode is a line-segment 
of length 4R (Fig. 83).
If we transform (11.20) using X' = Y, Y' = - X + 2R, x' = у, у' = - x + Я, 
then, omitting the primes, the elliptic motion is represented by
(11.23) 
X = x cos<£ - у sin ф, Y = x sin ф + у соъф + 2R(1 -cos<£).
Hence, a = 0, b - 2Я(1 - cos<£), which implies a0 - 
= a2 = 0, b0 = bt = 0;
this means that for ф = 0 we have canonical frames. The Cardan motion is 
therefore characterized by the following instantaneous invariants

A moving plane is said to be at a Cardan position if there is a Cardan 
motion such that instantaneously the paths of the two motions hyper-osculate. 
There has been some controversy about this concept which was cleared up 
recently (Bottema [ 1949], Freudenstein [I960]). Obviously any motion (with 
b2 / 0) is up to the second order a Cardan motion (with R = bj/2), but to the 
third order only if a3 = b5 = 0.
The inverse of a Cardan motion is called a cardioid motion. It may be 
defined as a motion such that two lines of E each pass permanently through a

different fixed point of 2. It is a rational motion because the Cardan motion is 
rational. The paths are given by (11.19) if X, Y are constant and x, у variable. 
Hence the path is in general a rational bicircular quartic (a curve called a 
limacon). The motion is generated if a circle with radius 2R rolls with internal 
contact on a circle with radius R.
Example 95. The path has one finite double point; determine the condition (on X. У) to be 
satisfied if it is a node, a cusp or an isolated point. (If the limacon has a cusp it is known as a 
cardioid, which has given the name to the motion.)

We have completed our discussion of the planar four-bar motion and its 
various sub-cases. We shall return to some of its properties in Chapter XI.
Now, we deal with some general theorems of plane kinematics which may 
be applied to some special motions discussed earlier.
From Chasles' theorems (in space) about the relations between the order of 
paths etc. for the direct and for the inverse motion (Section 1), we deduce for 
the plane, using analogous arguments, the following statement: if for a direct 
(algebraic) motion the order of the paths is, in general, equal to n, then for the 
inverse motion the class of the envelope generated by a moving line is, in 
general, equal to n, and of course the converse is also true. Keeping in mind 
that the inverse of the general four-bar motion is a general four-bar motion, 
that of a slider-crank motion a turning-block-crank motion, and that of a 
Cardan motion a cardioid motion, we may derive some new properties of 
these special plane motions.
Example 97. Show that the class of the envelope of a moving line for the four-bar motion is six, 
for the slider-crank motion again six, for the tuming-block-crank motion four, for the Cardan 
motion also four and for the cardioid motion two (Bottema [1976]).
Another general problem has been raised (and solved) by Roberts (1870, 
1876]: A plane motion is determined if two moving points Ai,A2 are 
compelled to describe given paths. If the orders of these paths are n, and n2 
respectively can the order of the path of a general point be derived? It 
appears that this is not possible. The problem is more refined, we must know 
not only the orders of the paths but moreover their circularity: the number of 
times they pass through each isotropic point.

The pertinent formulas are derived by Roberts by means of the so-called 
“principle of preservation of number” (German: Prinzip der Erhaltung der 
Anzahl), a much discussed and somewhat dubious argument no longer used 
by modern algebraic geometers. Roughly speaking it comes to this: if a 
geometric problem has in general n solutions then it has n solutions (or an 
infinite number) in a special case. The converse of this is the argument used by 
Roberts. To give an example: two curves with orders and m2 have mim2 
intersections (real, imaginary, coinciding) because this is the number if the 
curves degenerate into m} and m2 lines respectively.
Let the path K, of At be of order и, and circularity c, (i = 1,2); a 
degenerate specimen of K4 consists of c, circles and n, - 2c, straight lines. The 
motion under consideration degenerates into ctc2 four-bar motions, plus 
cf(n2 - 2c2) + с2(П) - 2cj) slider-crank motions, plus (nf - 2ciX«2-2c2) Car­
dan motions. The orders of the paths of these special motions are 6, 4 and 2 
respectively. Hence the order n and the circularity c in the general, 
non-degenerate, case are given by
n = 6ctc2 4- 4cj(n2 - 2c2) 4- 4c2(rti - 2ci) + 2(ni - 2с})(п2 - 2c2),
or
(11.25) 
n = 2И|Л2- 2cjC2,
and c = 3ctC2 4- ct(n2 - 2c2) 4- c2(n, - 2ci) or
(11.26) 
C = WjC24- n2C| - c(c2.
(11.25) and (11.26) are Roberts’ formulas.
Example 98. If с, » ca я 0 we obtain л = 2л,ла, с я 0.
Example 99. If с2 = 0 we obtain n - 2л,ла, с = лас,.
Example 100. Determine л and с if the two given paths arc ellipses, or an ellipse and a circle.
Example 101. Determine л and c if one path is an ellipse and the other a straight line. The 
answer is л = 4. c - 0. But. for the Cardan motion (л  2, c « 0) these conditions are also 
satisfied. Clarify the apparent contradiction. This example contains a warning with respect to the 
use of Roberts' formulas.
*
A plane motion may also be defined by its centrodes. The most simple 
example is the case where both centrodes are circles; these motions are called 
cycloidal motions. Let (Fig. 84) the fixed centrode be given by X2+ Y2 = R2 
and the moving centrode by x2 4- y2- r2 = 0. In the initial position their 
tangent point An is X = 0, Y = R; x = 0, у = - r. We take R >0; if the 
circles are externally (internally) tangent we take r >0 (r <0). In an arbitrary 
position Bt is the tangent point. Let LAnMBx = ф. Then arc A0B, = Rф, 
hence arc A0B0 = arc A |B, = R</r and therefore r0 = Rф. From this it follows

that the circle (m;r) has been rotated about the angle ф = Ф 4- 6 = 
((R + г)/г)ф' which implies ф = кф, with к = r/(R + r).
The coordinates of mt are X = - (R + r)sin Ф, Y = (R + г)со$ф. It follows 
from all this that the motion is represented by
X = x cos<£ - у sin ф - (R 4- r)sin кф,

у = x sin Ф 4- у соьф 4- (R + r) cos кф.
The path of a point is called a cycloid. It shows a variety of shapes, depending 
on x, у as well as k. The point m always describes a circle. If к is an irrational 
number no other point ever returns to its initial position and a generic 
point-path has infinitely many intersections with a suitably chosen circle about 
M. Hence the motion is in general transcendental. It is algebraic, however, if 
к is rational.

CHAPTER X
л-PARAMETER MOTIONS
1. Two-parameter spatial motions
A space E has six degrees of freedom when it moves without constraints 
with respect to a coinciding fixed space X. If E has to satisfy m < 5 
independent conditions the degree of freedom diminishes to n = 6-m. 
Kinematics in the usual sense deals with the case л = 1: the positions of E 
depend on one parameter t, which is generally taken to be time. When n = 1, 
the locus generated by a moving point, plane or line is a curve, a developable, 
or a ruled surface respectively.
In this chapter we consider the case л > 1, which means we are dealing with 
“л-parameter motions’* which we denote by M„. First, we suppose л = 2. The 
positions of E depend then on two parameters, A and д say. The locus of a 
point is now (in general) a surface, which is called its trajectory surface 
(French: surface trajectoire; German: Bahnflache); that of a plane is the set of 
tangent planes of a surface, enveloped by the plane; the locus of a moving line 
is its trajectory congruence (German: Bahnkongruenz). The connection with 
time, a one-dimensional phenomenon, has vanished, but in cases where we 
can take A(t), g(r) as arbitrary functions of one parameter t we have defined 
a motion in the ordinary sense, which “belongs” to M2, and to which the 
results of our preceding chapters may be applied.
We deal now with instantaneous two-parameter motion. At a certain 
zero-position we may study the differential-geometrical properties of a 
trajectory surface, its tangent plane, its normal, its curvature, etc. We may 
also study the analogous notions for a moving plane or line.
For the zero-position we suppose A = д = 0. If F(A, /x) is any function of A 
and /x we denote (dF/dA)(0,0) by FA, 
by FAm, etc.
The general two-parameter motion is given by

arbitrary functions of t. Let Ao = До = 0. For Mt we obtain the first derivative

Oxy is parallel to this plane. This implies = 0 and hence jy = /3 = 0.
Our parameters A, ц of M2 may be transformed into Л *,  д * by Л • =

The screw axis is the intersection of the plane given by the second equation of 
(1.11) and the plane represented by the third equation of (1.10). Hence for its 
Pliicker coordinates we have Pu: p24: P12 = A,: д t: - (caAj 4- сид>), which im­

We note that the screw axis (and the pitch) depend only on the ratio Ai: д t; 
hence (although there are motions Mj) in the neighborhood of the 
zero-position there are »’ screw axes, their locus therefore being a ruled 
surface R. If (x, y, z) is a point of R it follows from (1.10) that - Д|Х + A,y = 
0, while z is given by (1.11). Hence, eliminating дь A,, the equation of R 
reads

(x2 + y2)z - 6Ax2 + (aA - bjxy 4- aMy2 = 0,
and it is seen to be a cubic ruled surface. By a suitable transformation 
x = x'cos ф - у'sin ф, у = x'sin ф + y'cosi/r, z = z'+e the coefficients

[1876, 1900].
Example 1. Determine the Ф and e by which (1.13) transforms into (1.15).
Example 2. Show that R has two directrices, intersected by all generators: the 2-axis and the line 
at infinity of o.r The first is a double line of R so two screw axes pass through each of its points; 
the other is single.
Example 3. Show that R lies between two parallel planes.
Example 4. Determine the points on o, through which pass two orthogonal generators.
Example 5. Determine the two generators in the plane at infinity.
Example 6. Show that R contains ellipses.
Real generators pass through the point (0,0, z) only if 4z2^ (к,- к2У\ for 
the two limit points z = ±(k, - k2)/2 they coincide with the so-called dorsal 
lines of R. These satisfy Л, = ± and the pitch is (k, 4- k2)/2 for both; they 
are parallel to the planes x = ±y.
The axes o, and oy are generators of R, the pitches being and k2 
respectively; this gives an interpretation of the two instantaneous invariants. 
They are moreover the extreme values of the pitch a0.
According to (1.17) there are two generators, s> and s2, for which a0 = 0, so 
that they are axes of pure rotations. st, s2 are, however, only real if k|k2^0. 
We shall meet s4 once more in the next section. They are represented by
(1.18) 
x : у = V: V^k?, z = V-k|k2.
If к। = k2 the locus R degenerates into the pencil of lines through о in the 
plane z = 0 (and the two isotropic planes through o,). All screws then have 
equal pitches. If k, + k2 = 0 the lines s, are real and they coincide with the 
dorsal lines.
If ki = 0, k2 / 0 the lines s„ s2 both coincide with o,; for ki X 0, k2 = 0 they 
coincide with or
If k, = k2 = 0 all instantaneous motions are pure rotations; the origin of the 
moving system is at rest. M2 is instantaneously a spherical motion; all rotation 
axes are in the plane z - 0.
Example 7. If А,/д । - cot ф ( - (я/2)< Ф < (ir/2)) the locus of the endpoints of the screw vector 
(if its starting point is on o, and its length equals <ro) is given by
x » (fctcos2Ф ♦ lysin’ф)совф, 
у ■ (к, cos’ф + k2sin2 ф)я<п ф,
z - (ка- k,)sin Ф cos ф.

Summarizing the main result of this section we have: up to the first order 
any M2 is represented by

X = x 4- p.z + 
Y = у - Az + к2ц, Z = z - цх + X
А, д being the parameters of the motion and kb k2 the instantaneous 
invariants of the zero-position.
2. First order properties
All first order properties of a two-parameter motion follow from the 
canonical formulas (1.19). If (x, y, z) is any moving point, the tangent plane of 
its trajectory surface, at the zero-posit ion, passes through the directions 
XA : YA : ZA = A,: - z : у and XM : YM : ZM = z : k2: - x. For this plane U we 
obtain
Uj = xz - k2y, U2= yz + ktx, U5=z2 + k,A2, 
U4« - (x2 + y2 + z2)z - (A, - k2)xy - kik2z.
which expresses the (cubic) relationship between a moving point and the 
tangent plane of its trajectory surface.
Example 9. 
Determine the plane for a point on the z-axis and for a point at infinity.
From (2.1) it follows that the Pliicker coordinates ntl of the normal to the 
trajectory plane are the minors of the matrix

Hence all normals satisfy
(2.4)
Р2Л ~ к |P|4,
Pji = k2p24,
which implies that the locus of the normals is the intersection of two linear 
complexes and therefore a linear congruence. This theorem was first derived 
by Schonemann [1855] and independently by Mannheim [1875].

and we recognize the lines s( given by (1.18). Hence all normals intersect the 
axes of the two instantaneous (pure) rotation axes.
The congruence of normals is hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic if A|A2<0, 
AiA2 = 0 (but k, not both zero) or ktk2 > 0 respectively. Through each of the 
«•’ points of E passes a normal, there are. however, only c»2 normals. This is as 
expected: if P and О are two moving points their velocity components along 
PQ are equal; hence if О is a point on the normal n of P then n must be the 
normal of (?. Any normal is the normal for all its points.
Mannheim has drawn attention to a noteworthy analog between spatial 
M2-motion and planar Mrmotion. In the latter there are points, each 
describing a path and therefore each having an instantaneous normal; there 
are. however, only »’ normals. Their locus is the pencil of lines through the 
pole; there is in general only one normal through a given point, the pole being 
the only exception. In the spatial M2-motion the lines s( and s2 (real or 
imaginary) are analogous to the pole, there is in general one normal through a 
given point, points on s, are the only exceptions. We shall return to this 
analog in the next section.
Through any point P on s( pass lines of the congruence viz. all lines 
through P in the plane (P.s?); all these lines are normal to P’s velocity. The 
conclusion is: the tangent plane at P is undetermined, any plane containing 
the line q through P perpendicular to the plane (P,s2) acts as a tangent plane. 
In other words: although we deal with an M2-motion P can instantaneously 
only move in one direction, that of q. Similar conditions hold for all points on 
Sj. The movability of a point on s, is reduced from two to one degree of 
freedom. The analog in the plane is the fact that the pole is instantaneously at 
rest.
Example 10. Consider the case к,кг = 0, which means that the congruence of normals is 
parabolic. Determine the (only possible) velocity direction of a point on s (» s, » sj.
Example 11. Show that every plane of 1 is the tangent plane of one of its points.
We consider now the first order motion of a plane (uH u2, 
u4) of E. From

The coordinates of the characteristic point of a moving plane are therefore

We know that a moving point remains, for the linear approximation, in the 
tangent plane of its trajectory surface; we have now the dual: a plane moves 
about its characteristic point.
Example 12. Show that the formulas (2.9) are the inverse of (2.1). if we interchange X and x, Ut

the congruence of normals (2.4). The relation between a point and its tangent plane is birational.

In the differential geometry of lines there is a well-known theorem that any 
line 1 of a congruence is intersected by two of its neighbors; the points of 
intersection are called the foci of 1, the planes through 1 and these neighbors 
are the focal planes of 1. If we substitute (2.10) into ^PX4p23 = 0, the terms 
linear in A, p vanish and we obtain

the foci and the focal planes of the line 1 = (pv). This seems to give rise, 
however, to complicated algebra.

Show by means of (2.4) and (2.11) that the foci of a line I which coincides with a 
normal are its intersections with st and S}.
Example 17. 
Show that the locus of the lines with coinciding foci is a complex of the fourth 
order.
Another method to study the instantaneous behavior of an arbitrary line I is 
the following. Not making use of the canonical frames but normalizing the

between 1 and its consecutive positions are the generators of a cylindroid 
(Blaschke (I960)). By rotating the frame about O, equation (2.16) may be

This shows that although there are only two first order invariants, there are 
eighteen for the second order: gh h. (i = 1,2,3) and the nine second order 
partial derivatives of a, 6, c. This implies that second order spatial M2 theory is 
a complicated matter (Blaschke [1960, p. 81]). On the other hand the 
kinematicians of the second half of the 19th century, especially Mannheim 
[1894, pp. 127-160], obtained some interesting results using their ingeneous 
geometrical methods. Restricting ourselves to the motion of a point we shall 
derive by analytical means some theorems on the curvature of its trajectory 
surface (Bottema [1971]).
We have seen that there exists a certain analog between spatial M2- and 
planar Mr motion. In the latter one considers a normal, which is determined 
by its direction, and a point A on it given by its distance r from the pole (thus 
introducing polar coordinates for A). Of interest is the relationship between r 
and the center of curvature of A, which is also on the normal; this relation is 
the Euler-Savary equation.
Analogously we shall consider a fixed normal n, in space, by giving its 
direction cosines а, Д, y; if we assume y/0, excluding thereby horizontal 
normals, n (which intersects st and sj is completely determined by its 
direction. Moreover we fix the orientation of n with the condition у >0. If Ao 
is the intersection of n and the plane Z = 0, a point A on n is determined by 
the distance A0A - r (- » < r < x). We have now introduced “polar coordi­
nates” (r;a,/3, y) for A.
Any normal satisfies (2.4); hence p23= kta, p3t = k2& and therefore Ao = 
(к2Д/у, -kja/y,0). For A we obtain
(3.8) 
x = (k2/3/y) + ar, у = (- к,а/у) + /3г, z - yr.
To study the curvature of the trajectory surface we derive first some first 
order expressions. The arc-element on the surface is defined by the first

Differential geometry of surfaces has it that all second order properties 
depend on the fundamental expressions /V, Eh D, (i = 1,2,3), which are given 
here in terms of the polar coordinates of the moving point. We apply our 
results to the determination of the Gaussian curvature К (also called the 
measure of curvature, or specific curvature; German: Kriimmungsmass), 
which is the product of the two principal curvatures, of the trajectory surface. 
It is given by К = Д2/Д1, and therefore
(3.18) 
К = (r2 + y'rQi + y-4Q2)/(r2 + (M2/y2))’
which gives us the Gaussian curvature of the trajectory surface of a variable 
point on a fixed normal. The denominator is zero if A is one of the two 
intersections (real or imaginary) of the normal and the lines sb Sj. The 
numerator has two zeros, n and r2, real or imaginary, and (3.18) may be 
written
(3.19) 
K=(r-n)(r-n)/(r2 + <?)\
with q = к ik2/y2. We have К = 0 if r = r, or r = r2\ hence on any normal there 
are two points (of E) which while in the zero-position pass through a 
parabolic point of their trajectory surface. If these points are imaginary all 
real points of n are at elliptic points of their surface; if they are real and 
distinct there are on n both elliptic and hyperbolic points.
(3.19) is the analog of the Euler-Savary equation in Mi-planar motion, 
which may be written
(3.20) 
К = (r - r0)/r2,
rn being the distance from the pole to the intersection of the normal and the 
inflection circle.
Until now we have excluded the special normals parallel to the plane z = 0. 
There are two sets: those intersecting s> and parallel to s2 and those 
intersecting s2 and parallel to sr If s( intersects the z-axis at Sj a normal nt of 
the first set may be determined by the distance SiAn-d, Ao being the

from which к, and k2 may be found in terms of x, yyz and the twenty 
instantaneous invariants.
The Gaussian curvature К = KtK2 is given by
(3.28) 
K = (F,F,-F1)M2.
The locus of the points with К = 0 is represented by F|F>-FJ«O, if we 
exclude the singular points on s( and on Sj. This locus is therefore a sextic 
surface Sft, a theorem already proved by Mannheim [1875]. It passes twice 
through st and s2. The sixth order terms are seen to be z4(x2 + y2 + z2); hence 
SA passes through the isotropic conic and it intersects the plane at infinity in 
the line l(z = w = 0) counted four times. For a fixed value of z the 
polynomials E are quadratic functions of x, y. Hence a plane parallel to 
intersects Sft in a quartic curve, which shows that I is a double line of S*.  An 
arbitrary line in E has six intersections with S6, representing six points passing 
through a parabolic point of their trajectory surface. If, however, the line is a 
normal, four (two times two) intersections (with st and s2) do not correspond 
to such points. Hence on a normal there are only two parabolic points, as we 
found before. On a special normal there is only one.
This sextic surface is the analog of the inflection circle of the planar case. 
The pole must be excluded from the locus; on an arbitrary line there are two 
points (real or imaginary) passing instantaneously through an inflection point 
of their path; if the line is a normal there is only one.
Another locus follows from (3.26). The mean curvature is defined by 
(*i
 + k2)/2, it is zero if G = 0. Hence the locus of these points is a quintic 
surface Ss, passing through s( and s2 which must be excluded from the locus. 
The surface intersects the plane at infinity in the isotropic conic and the line I 
counted three times.
Example 21. Show that I is a double line of S$.
If the two principal curvatures at a point of a surface are equal the point is 
called an umbilic; it is defined by the conditions Ki = k2/0. The point is 
elliptic; its Dupin’s indicatrix, an ellipse in general, is a circle.
Example 22. Show that the locus of the moving points which are instantaneously at an umbilic of 
their trajectory surface is a surface SH,of order ten. Determine its intersection with the plane at 
infinity.

always maintain a fixed relative distance, 2Л, and a fixed relative angle, 2a. As 
parameters Л and /x we take the rotation angles about SA and SB respectively. 
The loci of points in E which have several finitely separated positions on 
spheres, planes, circles, cylinders or lines in 2 were derived by Roth [1967c], 
who considered such displacements as special similarity transformations, and 
showed that the loci degenerate for these special displacements. The instan­
taneous case has recently been studied by Tsai [1977] who proceeded as 
follows: If in the zero position we take the coordinate system o„t in E 
coinciding with the frame Oxyz in 2 and we take the origin О as the midpoint 
of the common normal between SA and SB, the Z-axis along the common 
normal (pointing from SA toward SB), and the X-axis along the internal 
bisector of SA and SB; we have the configuration shown in Fig. 85.
We can express this M2-motion as the ordered product of two Mi-motions: 
MB about SB followed by MA about SA. From Chapter III, (12.11)—(12.13) it 
follows that for Mn we have:

arbitrary functions of A and /x.

F2 = sin 2a (z — h) [ - x2 sin2 a 4- у2 cos2 a 4- (z2 - h2) cos 2a ]

where F(x, y, z) is a fifth degree polynomial in x,y,z. It is easily seen from 
(3.33) that the locus of all parabolic points is the plane z - h = 0 and the 
fifth order surface F(x, y, z). The fifth order terms of F(x, y, z) are 
z’(x24- y2+ z2) sin2 2a, hence the surface passes through the isotropic conic, 
and the line w = z = 0 three times. This surface has been studied by Tsai 
[1977J.

(i = 0,1,2,3) are linear functions, go is a constant, and g, (i = 1,2,3) are 
functions of order two at most. Then for a fixed (x, y, z) the homogeneous 
coordinates (X, У, Z, W) are quadratic functions of A and g. They represent a 
surface, well-known in classical algebraic geometry, usually called Steiner s 
surface or the Roman surface (see, for example, Sommerville [1934]). For the 
sake of brevity we shall denote such an M2 as a Steiner-motion. The surface 
has some interesting properties: it is a quartic surface with three double lines; 
there are four (tangent) planes whose intersections with the surface are conics 
counted twice; any tangent plane intersects the surface in two conics; the 
surface contains a set of conics.
Example 27. Show the surface is of the fourth order by determining the number of intersections 
with an arbitrary line.
Example 28. Show that the surface contains »г conics or. in kinematical terms, show that the 
Steiner М,- mot ion contains «’ Darboux М,-mot ions.
The Steiner motion has been studied at length by Darboux [1897]. 
Following him we remark that, as c( are linear functions of А, д there exists a 
linear relation between the four. Hence by a suitable linear transformation of 
the parameters we may arrive at c0 = 0 and two new independent parameters 
written as cjc^ or more elegantly as the three homogeneous param­
eters Ci, c2, c3. The Steiner motion is then represented by
X = (c?-c2-cj)x + 2cxc2y + 2cxcyz +gl(Ci,c2,cJ)w,

Y = 2c2cxx + (- c? + c2~ c3)y + 2с2са + g2(clt c2, c3)w, 
Z =2c3CiX + 2c3e2y +(-c?-cl + c?)z + g3(cb c2, c3)w, 
W = (c? + c2 + c?)w,
g. being arbitrary homogeneous quadratic polynomials of c,. The parameters 
of the motion have now a geometrical meaning: they are the direction 
numbers of the screw-motion (4.1). Its rotational part is a half-turn.
Example 29. Show that the Pliickcr coordinates of the screw axis of (4.1) are
Ди • CjS, PmwCjS,
Pu - 
“ Cjgi), P„ - Ifcigi “ C|g>), p,j - Rc.g, - C2g,).
with j1 « c?+c2 + c’. These formulas represent the congruence of the screw axes.
Example 30. Show that the translation distance of (4.1) reads (g,c, + g2c2 + g2c2)/3’; there are 
pure rotations in the set.
Darboux [1897] has shown that for a Steiner motion there are in general ten 
points whose trajectory surface is a plane.

Another method to define an M: is an extension of Krames’ procedure for 
obtaining an M(. In the latter case one started with an arbitrary ruled surface 
R in Г and reflected E into its generators, thus constructing positions of E 
with respect to J. To obtain an M2 we can reflect E into the lines of a 
congruence C in £. If C consists of the lines of a plane or of those through a 
point the results are trivial, the trajectory surface of any moving point being a 
plane or a sphere respectively.
For a non-trivial example we assume that C is a linear congruence, 
consisting of the transversals of two real, skew and perpendicular lines 1, and 
I2. Let )i be у = 0, z = h and 12 be x = 0, z = - h. From this it follows that the 
lines of C can be taken as

W = (A24-д24-4Л2>.
This is obviously not a Steiner motion because the translation terms are of 
degree three. To give an idea of the motion described by (4.3), we determine 
the trajectory surface of the origin. It is given by
X = 2А(д2 + 2Л2), Y = - 2д (A2 4-2h2), 
<4,4) Z= -2Л(Л2-д2), W = (A2 + M2 + 4/t2),
which implies
2hX = A (Z 4- 2h W), 2hY = ijl(Z - 2h W);
eliminating A and д, we obtain the equation of the surface explicitly:
(4.5) 
(X2 4- Y2 + Z2)Z - 2h (X2 - У2 4- 2hZW) W = 0,
which shows that it is a cubic surface.
Example 31. Determine the intersection of the surface and the plane at infinity; prove that the 
(finite) intersection with a plane Z = к is an ellipse and determine its semi-axes; show that the 
surface lies inside the parallel planes Z e ±2h.

A third method of constructing an M2 is to impose constraints on E 
equivalent to four simple conditions. We shall discuss an example: We obtain 
a two-fold condition if a curve of E is compelled to pass permanently through 
a fixed point of 2. Hence we obtain an M2 if two lines 1>, l2 of E pass through 
the points A j, A2 of 1 respectively. We take Iit 12 to be orthogonal skew lines 
with distance 2h; we introduce the frame in E such that
h: у = 0, z = h; 
12: x = 0, z = - h.
Furthermore, in 2, let
Ai = (0,0, m), A2 = (0,0, - m).
It is clear that the motion is only possible if h < m. If E is in a position such 
that 1, passes through At (i = 1,2) and it is then rotated about Oz, it obviously 
still is in a possible position. The conclusion is: all trajectory surfaces are 
surfaces of revolution with axis Oz.
The general motion is given by
P = Ap + d.
A is an orthogonal matrix ||a,t || and d = (a, 6, c). If the point (xo,0, h) of h 
coincides with A} and the point (0, y0, - h) of 12 coincides with A2 the 
following conditions must be satisfied
flnXo + Q\yh + a = 0,
(4.6) a2iX0+a23h + b = 0, 
вцХо+ Qyyh + c = m, 
Eliminating a, 6, c we obtain

a2iX0 - a22yo 4- 2a23h = 0,

Multiplying these equations, respectively, by an, a2i, (hi, then adding them, 
and then repeating this process using a12, a22, a32 and al3, a23,.a33, we get

which means that the angle between ог and Oz has the constant value 6. This 
is, however, one of the Eulerian angles (Chapter VI, Section 3) and it seems 
appropriate to choose the other two as the motion’s parameters. The 
components a, 6, c follow from (4.6) and (4.8) and are seen to be
a = m(- ацая + fli2au), b = m(-a2tan + ana^),

c = m(- a;, + а Л2).
Therefore, making use of the formulas (3.1) of Chapter VI we obtain the 
following explicit representation of the M2:
X - (cos ф cos f - sin ф sin £ cos 6 )x
+ (- sin ф cos f - cos ф sin f cos 3 )y

4- m cos2</r sin2 0,
with £ and ф as parameters. Putting tanl£ = Л, tanji/r = /x we see that the 
motion is rational.
Example 32. Show that for Ф = constant (4.11) represents a rotation about the Z-axis; indeed 
XJ + Y3 and Z as well do not depend on This confirms analytically that any trajectory surface 
is a surface of revolution. Also show that cos# » him follows directly from the fact that the 
projection of A|A} on o, has a constant length.

x cos(£ + <A)- у sin(f 4 Ф), Y = x sin(f + <Д) + у cos(£ + ф), Z e z and M, is degenerated into

Example 34. Consider the case < = 0; show that the relation (4.11) yields Y sin 6 - Z cos 9 + z = 
0; prove that the trajectory surface of any point is generated by rotating a rational bicircular 
quartic plane curve about Oz.
Equation (4.11) is a parametric representation of the trajectory surface of 
(x, y, z). To obtain an explicit equation we must eliminate the parameters ф 
and £ from the three equations. We know that the result must be an equation 
of the type F((X24- Y2),Z) = 0. From (4.11) it follows after some algebra,

where S = X24- Y24-Z2-z2.
Hence for this M2, the trajectory surface (of revolution) of an arbitrary 
point A(x, y, z) of E is a surface of order eight. Its intersection with the plane 
at infinity is the isotropic conic counted four times.
There are some special cases: If A is on the common perpendicular of the 
moving lines lb I2, we have x = у = 0 and the trajectory is the sphere
(4.16) 
X24- Y2 4-Z2 = z2 4-m2 sin2 0,
counted four times.
If A is on h we have у = 0, z = h = m cos 0; its trajectory surface is seen to 
be the quartic surface (counted twice) with the equation
(4.17) 
(X2 4- Y24-Z2-m2)2-x2(X’+ Y2 + (Z - m)2] = 0,
it has the isotropic conic as a double curve and it is therefore a eye Ude.
It should be noted that although a moving point A remains, during the M2, 
on its surface (4.15), there may be points on the surface which A may not 
reach in any real position of E; this is a consequence of the process used to 
eliminate the motion parameters.
To investigate this we may determine from (4.11) the maximum and the 
minimum values ZM and Zm of Z, considered as a function of ф. The locus of 
the moving point is then that part of the surface of revolution lying between 
or on the parallel planes Z = ZM and Z = Zm.

Example 36. Determine ZM and Z„ for a point (x.O, m cos 0) on I, and the zone on the cyclide 
(4.17) which is its locus for the motion.
Example 37. The surface (4.17) passes through At(0,0, m) for any point A on l(; show from 
(4.13) that A passes through A, for a real position only if x,«4mJsinJ0.
Example 3d. Determine the trajectory surface for a point (0, y, - h) on l2.
Example 39. Intersect the cyclide (4.17) with a plane Z = к ; show that the intersection consists 
of two circles and investigate whether they are real or imaginary.
Example 40. We have determined M2 by means of the Eulerian angles; if we make use of the 
Euler parameters c, (i « 1.2,3,4). the fundamental relation a,, = cos0 reads
(c«- c’ - c2 + c’) = cos 0(c« + c? + c, + c»)«
Show that the c.may be expressed as coe (1 - A/x)cos>0, c, » (1 + A/i)sin}0. c2- (A - /t)sin 10, 
Ci = (A +/a)cosJ0; derive the equations for the motion in terms of the rational parameters 
A and д.
The inverse motion of our M2 is the following. In E, now the fixed space, 
two orthogonal skew lines lt, h, with distance 2h are given; two points Ah A2 
(with distance 2m) of the moving space 2 move along lb l2 respectively. 
Obviously the motion of the line 1= AtA2 is-an Mrmotion, while 1 may 
rotate about I in any position of the latter.
Example 41. Derive the equation of the locus of I and prove that it is a quartic ruled surface; 
determine its intersection with the plane at infinity; show that all generators make the constant 
angle 0 with o,.
In plane kinematics any M, may be defined by the rolling of a moving 
centrode on a fixed centrode. It is obvious from the preceding developments 
that there does not exist an analog of this for an M? in space. If a surface F is 
compelled to roll on a fixed surface F*  they must be tangent at a point A 
which is instantaneously at rest, which implies that the motion is instantane­
ously spherical. It is well-known from dynamics that the rolling conditions are 
in general not integrable (the conditions are called non-holonomic). Integra­
bility takes place if F and F' are isometric and thus applicable one cn the 
other.

we specialize the motion by assuming that the translation part is permanently 
equal to zero. Hence, making use of canonical frames, the first and the second 
order instantaneous properties for spherical M2-motion are in view of (1.14) 
and (3.7) given by
XA = 0, Уд = - z, ZA = y,
(51) 
X„ = z, Y„ = 0, Z„ = - x,
and
Хдл = - /зУ + f2Z, Удд = - у + /эх - /«Z, ZAA = - z - f2x + /ty,

XMM = - x - Лэу 4*  h2z, 
Умм = hyx - hiZ, = - z - h2x + h^y.
This implies that there are no instantaneous invariants of the first order and 
nine of the second. The rotation axes in the zero-posit ions are the lines 
through О in the plane z = 0; the points of this plane are singular, they are 
only able to move parallel to Oz. The curvature of trajectory' surfaces is not 
interesting, because any point of E moves on a sphere with center O. The set 
of normals are the lines through O.
Example 42. Check rhe formula (3.18) (for the Gaussian curvature of the trajectory surface) for 
the case of spherical motion.
A continuous spherical M2 may be defined by giving the Eulerian angles (or 
Euler parameters) as functions of two parameters Л, д. As a spherical motion 
has three degrees of freedom it could also be done by introducing one 
constraint.
Example 43. Consider the spherical M. for which the point x » у «0, 2 =/t >0is compelled to 
remain in the plane Z * H >0, with h > H. Show that any point on of has an M,-motion, its path

Consider the inverse motion.
6. Two-parameter plane motions
Plane two-parameter motions have been treated in different ways (Boulad 
[1916], Darboux [1916], Koenigs [1917], van der Woude [1926], Blaschke 
and Muller [1956]). We could do it by specializing the spatial M2 theory, but

an M2 is defined if Ф, a, b are given as functions of two parameters А, д. 
Accepting a certain asymmetry we take ф and a as the parameters. Hence
(6.1) 
X = x cos Л - у sin Л + /д, Y - x sin A + у cos A 4- Ь(А, д ),
where the constant length / (which may be chosen as the unit of length) has 
been introduced for the sake of elegance: both A and д are now dimension­
less variables. We choose the two frames to coincide at A = д = 0; hence 
6(0,0) = 0.
If we consider time as the motion parameter then A(t), д(г) define an Mi 
belonging to (6.1). Its pole P for the zero position is seen to be
(6.2) 
xp = - (Mi + ЬддО/Аь yp = /Д|/Аь
which depends only on the ratio А,/д|. Hence the poles for all possible M, 
satisfy
(6.3) 
lxp + b^yp + lb, = 0;
their locus is a straight line p, called the polar line for the zero-position of 
the M2.
The (coinciding) frames are as yet arbitrary. We take the у-axis along p. 
This implies b, = 
= 0, and we obtain
(6.4) 
XA = - у, Хя = t Уд = x, Ум = 0,
which shows that M2 has no instantaneous invariants of the first order.
For an Mi belonging to M2 we have
(6.5) 
Х=-уА1 + /д>, У = хА„
the velocity of A(x, y) being orthogonal to AP with xp = 0, yp - IfiJAi (Fig. 
86). There is one Mi which is instantaneously a translation: Ai = 0, its 
direction being parallel to Ox. Any point not on p is able to move in any 
direction; the exceptional points are those of the у-axis, they can only move 
parallel to Ox. If we take another time-scale t, the ratio Aj/д । does not change 
and as we are only interested in time-independent properties we may without 
loss of generality normalize the time-scale by supposing A2 + д?= 1. This 
implies that for the point Ao = (/,0) we have X = Y = /А, and therefore 
X2 + Y2 = /’; for all M, of M2, the scalar value of the velocity of Ao has the 
constant value /. In other words: the hodograph of Ao is a circle.
If we put Ai = cos i//, д| = sin ф, it follows from (6.5)
(6.6) 
X = - у cos ф + I sin ф, Y - x cos Ф,

which means that the hodograph of A (x, у) is an ellipse e(x, у) whose explicit 
equation is seen to be
(6.7) 
x2X2 + 2xyXY + (y2+Z2)Y2 = l2x2.
Elementary analytical geometry shows that the area F of e is rr/|x |, this 
being a measure of some kind for the movability of A. It depends only on x; 
for a point on the polar line we have F = 0.
In terms of ф the pole P is seen to be (0,/ tan ф) and the corresponding 
angular velocity at = cos ф.
Example 44. Determine the semi-axes of the ellipse c(x. y).
We consider now second order properties. Differentiating (6.1) twice and 
then putting A = д = 0, we obtain

Our У-axis has been fixed, but the X-axis is still arbitrary. If we chose it along 
the line У = Ьла we have bAA = 0. The canonical frame is now completely 
determined if we orient OY so that >0, and we see that there are two 
second order instantaneous invariants ЬАя = b' and bptt = b"^0. Hence any 
M2 may, up to the second order, be represented in a suitably chosen frame by
X = x - yA 4- IfjL - IxA2, 
(6’9) 
У = у 4- xA 4- Ь'Ад 4- \b"ix2.
This enables us to determine the polar line up to the first order. Considering 
the Mi given by A(t), and putting X = У = 0, we obtain (restricting the 
results to contain, at highest, linear terms)
(6.10) 
xp= - b'X tan ф - m(6'4- b"tan ф), yp = / tan i/r;
the (®2) polar lines in the neighborhood of the zero-position are obtained by 
eliminating ф:
(6.11) 
1х+(П 4-b>)y 4-/b> =0.
Differentiating (6.10) with respect to t and then putting / = 0 yields the 
components of the pole velocity in the zero-posit ion:
(6.12) 
(xp)i= - 2b'sin ф - b” s\n2 ф/cos ф, (ур)х = 1ф/cos2 Ф.
This implies that for a pole (0,/tani/,) the (»') velocities have the property 
that the x-component is constant while the у-component varies. In other 
words: the hodograph of the pole velocities is a line parallel to the у-axis. 
(The pole velocity is the rate at which different points in E become poles; it is 
not the velocity of any point.)
We know from plane kinematics that the diameter of the inflection circle is 
equal to the pole velocity divided by the angular velocity w and moreover that 
its direction is found by rotating the pole velocity about P by angle - ir/2. 
Hence the locus of the inflection poles В corresponding to the Mi’s with pole 
P is a straight line m, parallel to Ox, intersecting Or at the point Bo such that

7. Examples of three-parameter motions
It is understandable that n-parameter motions for n >2 have not been 
given much attention by kinematicians. In plane and in spherical kinematics 
the most general motions have a degree-of-freedom equal to three and an M3 
for these cases could not be defined by an equality condition (at most it might 
be restricted by an inequality); no M„ for и >3 can exist.
In space some 3-parameter motions have been considered. One is men­
tioned, but not discussed, by Koenigs [1897, p. 241).
As an example we consider the case where the space E moves such that 
three points B2, By on a given line I remain in three given planes Vb V2, V3 
of 2. The motion is in a certain aspect a generalization of the Cardan motion 
in a plane. It has obviously three degrees of freedom, but it is of a special 
kind. In any position of I the space E can freely rotate about 1. Hence 1 itself 
and each of its points have essentially a two-degrees-of-freedom motion.
We consider the case where are three mutually orthogonal planes and 
we take them as the Cartesian frame OXYz in J. In E we take such that оя 
coincides with I; let B, = (h,0,0). As always the motion will be represented by 
P = Ap A being an orthogonal matrix ||a,J|. Then for Bi to be perma­
nently in X = 0, etc., it follows that di = - aitbt. Our motion is therefore
X = au(x - b>)+ ai2y + e»:, Y = a2i(x - b2) + a22y + a2yz,
Z = 03i(x - by) + ai2y + ayyZ,
On satisfy a Ji + aL + a» = 1 but they are otherwise arbitrary.
From this it follows that the trajectory surface of a point В = (b,0,0) on 1, 
different from the points Bh has the equation
(7.2) 
X2/(b - bCf 4- Y2/(b - b2)2 + Z2/(b - by)2 = 1,
which shows that the surface is an ellipsoid, with Ox, Or, Oz as its axes of 
symmetry. If В coincides with we have since aji + aj, < 1:

hence the locus of the positions of B, consists of the points on or inside an 
ellipse, and similar for B2 and B3.
Example 50. Show that (in general) there are three points on I for which the trajectory surface is 
an ellipsoid of revolution.
Example 51. When is the ellipse given by (7.3) a circle?
The line 1 has ®2 positions in J and its locus is therefore a congruence, 
which we denote by C. Since 1 joins B, and B2, which according to 
(7.1) have coordinates = [0, a2,(bi - b2), au(bt - by), 1] and B2 = 
(Л||(Ь2 - bi),0, ait(b2 - b3), 1J, its Pliicker vectors (P, (?) have coordinates

(7.4) 
O, = (b2 - b3)a2ta3b O2 = (by - bj)a3i«n,
Оз= (bi - b2)aii«2i.
These formulas give a representation of C by means of the parameters «21, 
du satisfying aJi + a2l + 
= 1. From (7.4) it follows that C belongs to the
tetrahedral complex with the equation
(7.5) 
biPiOi + b2P2Q2 + byPyQy = 0.
The planes Vf and the plane at infinity are the faces of the associated 
tetrahedron. This result could be expected because 1 intersects the four planes 
at four points with a constant cross-ratio.
The planes V, (i = 1,2,3) are singular planes of C. Indeed, if 1 is in V,, say, 
it is sufficient that B, is on Oz and By on Oy. Hence 1 has in V1 a Cardan 
motion. There are lines 1 in V>, the tangents of an astroid, a curve of class 
four.
The degree of C is the number of lines 1 passing through a (non-singular) 
point P. Let P be in V,. Through P pass two kinds of lines 1. If Bi does not 
coincide with P then I is in Vt; four such lines pass through P. If Bi coincides 
with P then I is a common generator of two circular (half-) cones, with vertex 
В, and with their axes perpendicular to V2 and V3 respectively; there are two 
such lines, real or imaginary. The conclusion is: the degree of C is six.
Example 52. Show that the six lines I through an arbitrary point are generators of a quadratic 
cone.
Example 53. Determine the lines of C through O.
The class of C is the number of lines in a (non-singular) plane U. Let U 
intersect Ox, Ov, Oz in the distinct points Sb S2, S3. If B, is on S2S3, B2 on

S3S| then By describes (again in view of Cardan’s motion) an ellipse. This has 
two points, real or imaginary, on S|S2. Hence two lines 1 are in U; the class of 
C is two. C is seen to be a (6,2) congruence (Sturm [1893]).
Example 54. If atl = Ac, then A2(c, + c, + c\) 1. If A—»*  and therefore cf + c2 + o’-*0,  show 
that P, = Pj« P»“0 and EQjO»(bj- b*)
’’ = 0. This implies that the plane V at infinity is a 
singular plane of C; the lines 1 in V are the tangents of a curve of class four; three tangents are 
real, all others are imaginary.
Example 55. Determine the lines of C through a point at infinity. Determine the equations of C 
from (7.4), one of these is (7.5).
We now give a second example of a motion with three parameters. 
Darboux [1897] has considered the case where the vertices A,, A2, Ay of a 
triangle in the moving space are compelled to remain in the planes Vt, V2, V3 
of a trihedron in S respectively. The only property he proved is a negative 
one: There is no fourth point whose motion is planar.
We deal with the special case of the three planes V, being mutually 
orthogonal and we take them as the coordinate planes of the Cartesian frame 
Oxyz in 2. Furthermore we suppose the triangle A}A2Ay to be acute. Then 
there are two (real) points such that their joins to A, are mutually orthogonal; 
we take one of them as the origin о in the moving space and oA,, oA2, oAy as 
o., oy, ox. Hence A । = (p, 0,0), A2 = (0, q, 0), A3 = (0,0, r); we suppose that A t 
remains in the plane X =0, A2 in Y = 0, Ay in Z = 0. Then the M3 is 
represented by
X = Дц(х ~ p)+ ai2y + floZ,
(7.6) 
У = a2lx 4- a22(y - q)+ a23z,
Z = амх 4- a,2y 4- аэ>(х - r), 
where ||a„ || is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix; it may be expressed by means of 
the Euler parameters (Chapter VI, (2.1)), and the motion is then given in 
terms of the four homogeneous numbers ct.
During the motion a point A of E occupies ®3 positions in 1 and we may 
expect that A covers in general a three-dimensional region G(A) of 1. Our 
aim could be to determine G(A) for each point A of E.
We take first some special points. Let Ao coincide with the origin of E. 
Then its positions are according to (7.6)
X= -p(ci+ c\- c2- ctyN,
Y = -</(cJ-c?4"cl“C?)/N,
(7'7) 
Z =-r(cj-cj-c’ +c?)/N,

The coordinates X. Y, Z depend on cf, four homogeneous positive numbers. 
Hence if Ao occupies a certain position in 5 it does so for all positions 
(c0, ± Ci, ± c2, ± Сз) of E. This implies that if no c, is equal to zero, Ao is at the 
same point of 2 for eight positions of E; this number reduces to four if one 
parameter c, is equal to zero, to two if two parameters are zero, and to a 
single one if three numbers ct are zero. There are four possibilities for the 
latter case: c0 =1, c> = c2 = c3 = 0; Ci = 1, c0 = c2 = c3 = 0, etc. The corre­
sponding positions of Ao arc:
Bo = ( - p, - 
- r), B, = (- p, q, r),
B2 = (p, - q, r), B, = (p. q, - r).
B, are the vertices of a tetrahedron B; the planes of its faces are given by
(X/p) + (Y/q) + (Z/r) -1=0, - (X/p) + (Y/q) + (Z/r) + 1 = 0.
(78) (X/p)-(y/q) + (Z/r)+l = 0, 
(X/p) + (У/q)-(Z/r)+1=0, 
respectively.
If Xo, Yo, Zo is an attainable point of Ao then (7.7) considered as three 
linear equations for the unknowns c2, must have solutions with non-negative 
ratios. We obtain
cj: c?: c?: cl = - ((X0/p) + (Y0/q) + (Z<Jr)- 1):
(7.9)
(-(X0/p) + (Ye/<?) + (Za/r)+l):
((Xo/p)-(Yo/^) + (Zo/r)+l): 
((Xo/p) + (Yo/q)-(Zo/r)+l),
and this implies that Xo, Y(1, Zo is a point of the closed region B. If for instance 
c2 - c3 = 0, we have X = - p,
Y= -4(cJ-c?)/(c§+cJ), Z= -r(cj-cl)/(cj + cf),
which means that the position of Ao is on the edge BOB|, covering the closed 
interval between the two vertices. If c3 = 0 the locus of Ao is the closed 
triangle B0BjB2, if no c, is zero Ao is at an internal point of B. Summing up: 
the region G covered by the origin of oxyi consists of the vertices, the edges, the 
faces and the internal points of the tetrahedron B.
Example 56. Show that opposite edges of В have equal length; В is an equifacial tetrahedron.

between B, and Bt corresponds to two points of k0. We determine now the 
locus of A if Ao is on a face of the tetrahedron B, say the face B|B2B3. Then

Steiner surface contains x* conics and that through two given points passes a 
unique conic.)
All this leads to the following conclusion. The region G(A) covered by an 
arbitrary point of E has in general the following shape; it could be called a 
pseudo-tetrahedron T. Il has four vertices, any three of them are joined by a 
part of a Steiner surface F. (i = 0,1,2,3); F, and F; have the ellipse kv in 
common.
The ellipse k23, corresponding to c0 = ct = 0, is in the plane X = - (x — p); 
analogously k«i, with c2 = C\ = 0, is in the plane X = x - p. Moreover it is easy 
to prove that kol follows from k^ by reflection into the plane X = 0. Hence 
two “opposite’* ellipses are congruent. The “face” DiD2D> of T is the part of 
Fo cut off by the planes X = - (x - p), Y = - (y - q), Z = - (z - r). If A 
tends to A,, the vertices D, tend to B„ the faces of T become more flat and 
their limits are the planes of B.

with the rectangle is wrong: if co = c3 = 0, Ci = c2 the point Ai is at (0, p, r) 
which is outside the rectangle if p>q. From (7.15) it follows

Our first example of this section covered the special case when At, A2y Ay 
are collinear. We saw that the motion becomes essentially an M2. This 
completes our discussion of the second example.
If a motion is the result of the product of two screw motions (about two 
different axes) then instantaneously, to the first order, it is irrelevant in which 
sequence the two component motions occur. The same is true for the product 
of any number of screw motions. If each component screw is taken about a 
specified axis and has a known pitch, then any such system of n -screws 
describes a certain n-parameter motion. Such systems were originally studied 
by Rodrigues [1840], Ball [1876] and some of the other classical geometers. 
Recently interest has been renewed in these motions especially in regard to 
determining the instantaneous mobility of linkwork (Sharikov [1961], Voinea 
and Atanasiu [1962], Hunt [1968], Waldron [1969], etc.). It is mainly 
necessary to consider the case n - 1,2,3, since results for n =4,5 follow 
from n = 2,1 by considering the so-called reciprocal screw system.

CHAPTER XI
A MAPPING OF PLANE KINEMATICS
1. The mapping
A displacement D(a, b, </>) in the plane is determined by three numbers. 
This has led to the idea of mapping the set of displacements onto the points of 
a three-dimensional space, and also to the idea of using this map to derive 
theorems of plane kinematics. This was done first by Grunwald [1911] and 
soon after by Blaschke [1911]. In their monograph on plane kinematics, 
Blaschke and Muller [1956] have given a treatment of the method making 
use of quaternions. Valuable contributions to the subject are also due to Beth 
[1937, 1938, 1949), who preferred to apply geometric reasoning. In this 
chapter we deal with the mapping in a more elementary way.
Let Oxy be a Cartesian frame in the fixed plane Z and o,y one in the 
moving plane E. The displacement D(a, b, </>) is given by
X = x cos ф - у sin ф + a,
Y = x sin ф + у cos</> + b,
in which a, b are the coordinates of о and ф (0^ Ф < 2тг) is the rotation 
angle. If a = b = Ф = 0 the two frames coincide and E is in its “zero­
position”. If D is not a translation, that is if ф/ 0, we know that there exists a 
rotation, with its center at X = x = xp, Y = у = yp and with rotation angle Ф, 
which transforms E from its zero-position to (a, b, </>). We introduce a 
three-dimensional projective space J' with homogeneous coordinates Xt 
(i = 1,2,3,4) and we define the mapping by
(1.2) 
Xi: X2: X>: X4 = xpu : ypu : и : 1,
in which и = tan \ф, and we exclude for the time being the case ф = n.
In order to determine the image point (1.2) in terms of the parameters 
a, b, ф we must solve for xP and yp. Setting X = x, У = y, in (1.1) and using 
half-angles we have:

We also define (1.6) as the image point for the cases ф = 0 and Ф = тт which 
have been excluded so far; obviously it has sense for both of these cases 
whereas (1.2) has none when ф = тг. Hence all displacements have now a 
unique image; the zero-position is the point О = (0,0,0,1), translations 
(Ф = 0) and half-turns (ф = тг) are mapped onto the points of the planes 
Хл = 0 and X4 = 0 respectively.
We ask now if each point of У' is the image of a displacement. Accordingly, 
we try to determine a, 6, Ф if the X, are given. If Хл = 0, X4/0 we have at 
once a = 2X2/X4, b = -2X»/X4, ф = 0; if X4 = 0, Хл/0 we obtain a = 
2X,/X„ b = 2Х2/Хъ ф = 77. If X,/0. X4/0 then
и = tan J ф = X.i/X4,
(1.7) 
cos</> = (1 - m2)/(1 + u2)= (Xi- Xi)/(Xj + Xi),
sin ф = 2u/(l + u2) = 2X>XJ(X\ + Xi).
Furthermore
a - 6 cot \ф = 2Х./Х»,
a cot 4 ф 4- b = 2XzlXy,
which gives us
(1.8) 
a = 2(X1X,+ X2X4)/(X?+Xi), b = 2(X2X>-X.X4)/(Xi + Xi).
These formulas also yield the correct result if either X3 or X4 is zero.
From (1.7) and (1.8) we see that any real image point is the map of a 
displacement provided X5 and X4 are not both zero. Hence in S' the only

points which do not correspond to a displacement are the points on the real 
line 1 given by the equations X3 = X4 = 0.
If we deal with imaginary points of 2' we see from (1.7) and (1.8) that they 
are maps of (imaginary) displacements provided X} + X4 / 0. Hence there are 
two conjugate imaginary planes in S', V, with equation X3- iX4 = 0 and V2 
with X3+ iX4 = 0, the points of which are not the image of a displacement of 
the type (1.1). The (real) singular line 1 is the intersection of V, and V2.
The displacement (1.1) expressed in terms of the image point coordinates X, 
is now seen to be:
X = (XJ- X})x - 2X,X4y + 2(X,X3 4- X2X4)z,
(1.9) 
Y = 2X3X4x + (Xi - X?)y + 2(X2X3 - X,X4)z,
Z = (Xj+Xi)z.
The determinant Д of this linear transformation is equal to (Xj + Xi)5, and we 
have a non-singular transformation if Д 0.
Example 1. Show that if Д / 0, the inverse transformation of (1.9) reads
X - (Xi - X?)X + 2Х.Л Y 4- 2(X|X> - X2X4)Z,
у - - 2X>X«X + (XI- XI) Y + 2(X2X, + X(X4)Z,
z -(XJ+X1)Z.
If X3 = X4 = 0 all coefficients of (1.9) are zero; the transformation has no 
meaning and we indeed exclude the image points on 1. If however Д = 0, X3 
and X4 not both equal to zero, (1.9) is singular but not senseless. We take for 
instance X3 = iX4 / 0 (which means that the image point is in Vi but not on 1), 
this yields
X = 2Xix - 2iXiy + 2(iX, + X2)X4z,
(1.10) 
Y = 2iXix + 2Xiy 4- 2(iX2- X.)X4z,
Z = 0,
and we have Y = iX for any X,, X2 and for any x, y, z. Denoting the isotropic 
points (1, i, 0) and (1, - i,0) of E and 2 by /, and Z2, we must accept that any 
point for which X, Y are not both equal to zero is, after the singular 
displacement, situated at h. An exception must be made for those points for 
which X= Y = 0, the transforms would then lead to (0,0,0) which is 
undetermined. From (1.10) these points satisfy

i(x-xpz)+(y-ypz) = 0
which is the line Ph- The formulas would allow us to consider any point of the 
plane as the transform of any point Q of P/2, but we want to define the 
displacement of Q on arguments of continuity. As (1.11) is linear, the 
transform of Pl2 must be a straight line. P must be on it because for a 
non-singular displacement P is conjugate to itself. But h must also be on it, 
for all points of a line intersecting PI2 and not on it are displaced to h- Hence 
our definition: any point on PI2 has as its transform all points of Ph. This also 
seems reasonable from the following argument. We consider all rotations 
about P; the path of any point at a distance p from P (real or imaginary, but 
unequal to zero) is a non-degenerate circle. For all non-singular rotation 
angles, P is at rest, a point Q, on Р/, travels along Ph, a point Q2 on PI2 goes 
along PI2.
If tanj<£ = i (or, what is the same thing, tan ф = i) we have a singular 
displacement, called isotropic and denoted by D*:
 all points not on Ph move 
to /1, which we knew to be a point of their paths (seeing now moreover that 
they arrive there all at the same instant), any point on PZ2, however, must be 
considered to be situated at all points of Ph simultaneously. For the 
conjugate isotropic rotation D , with tanl</>= - i, we have the same 
phenomenon with h and h interchanged. The consequence is that not only a 
point with p/0 describes a complete circle (including the points h,h) but 
that the same holds for the points with p = 0. These are the points on Ph and 
Ph and especially P itself, clearly such points have irregular motions. Any 
point O2 on PI2, different from P, moves in the traditional way along Ph and 
then by D*  occupies the complete line Ph; a point Qi on Ph travels along Ph 
but by D~ fills the line PZ2; the center P is at rest for any non-isotropic 
displacement, but occupies Ph by D*  and PI2 by D". Any point on the “zero” 
circle has this circle as its complete path.
All circles with center P have a common tangent at h which coincides with 
Ph, because such a line is perpendicular to itself; and similar for Z2. Isotropic 
displacements play an essential part in our mapping. The ®2 displacements D*  
(one for any finite center P) are mapped on the points of V,, not on I; the D" 
are mapped on those of V2, not on 1. A D*  is determined by its center P and its 
image point is (xp, yp, 1, - i) in Vb apd analogously for D~. Conversely a point 
(Xi, X2,1, - i) of V, corresponds to the displacerflent for which any point of 
Ph with P = (X,, X2) moves to all points of Ph, and all other points go to h-

THE GEOMETRY OF THE IMAGE SPACE

2. The geometry of the image space
The image of a displacement, as defined by (1.2), depends on the arbitrarily 
chosen zero position of E as well as the frame in 1. This means that there are 
mappings. We now study the relationships between these mappings. 
Obviously we obtain another mapping if we take another frame in X and, 
independently, another frame in E. Then the new zero position is implicitly 
determined as that position of E for which its frame coincides with that of S.
We take a new frame in X, with coordinates X', Y' given by the relations
(2.1) 
X’ = X cos a - Y sin a 4- p, Y’ = X sin a + Y cos a + q,
and a new one in E, with coordinates x', y':
(2.2) 
x = x'cos/3 - y'sin/3 4-г, 
у = x'sin /3 + y'cos/3 4- s.
Eliminating x, у by means of (2.1), (2.2) and
(2.3) 
X = x cos ф - у sin ф 4- a, 
Y = x sin ф 4- у cos ф 4- b,
we obtain
(2.4) 
X' = x'cos<£'~ y'sin ф' + a\ Y' = x'sin </>'4- y'cos<£' 4- b\
with
Ф' = ф 4- a 4- /3,
(2.5) 
a' = r cos (Ф 4- a) - s sin (ф 4- a) 4- a cos a - b sin a 4- p,
b' = r sin (ф 4- a) 4- s cos(</> 4-a)+asinat4-b cos a 4- q.
Substituting (2.4) into (1.6) allows us to obtain a relation between the old and 
the new image points:
X । = (COS у 1)X| ■“ (sin У1)Хг 4*  fljjXj 4- (214X4,

those notions and relations, in are relevant which are independent of the 
two frames, or in other words which are invariant for the group (2.6).
From (2.6), it is easy to verify that the line 1 (X3 = X4 ® 0) is invariant for G
*,
 
and also the points J, (l,i,0,0) and J2 (1, - <’,0,0) on it and the planes Vf 
(X3 = iX4) and V2 (X3 = - iX4) through it. Thus, as could have been expected, 
the singular elements of the mapping are independent of the frames.
The group is not completely defined by its fixed elements. If a linear 
transformation
(2.7) 
Х' = 11МХ
leaves 1, Л, Л, V>, V2 invariant, we have a(i - a22 = 0, ai2 + a2i = 0, 
=
0, ам+ a43 = 0, a3l = a32 = a4, = a42 = 0, which are eight relations for essen­
tially fifteen parameters, and from this a group G7 would follow. It is seen 
from (2.6) that we have moreover anea- a}2a2i = 
ам<243.
The group G6 (2.6) has sub-groups with kinematical interpretations. If we 
do not alter the zero-position of E, but change the frames in E and J in the 
same way, it follows from (2.1) and (2.2) that 0 = - a and therefore ф' = Ф, 
which is obvious. Moreover the rotation centers P are the same as before, but 
they have other coordinates, i.e., xp= xpcosa - ypsin a + p, yp = 
xpsin a + ypcosa + q. The corresponding transformations in £' read
Xi = Xicosa - X2sina + pX3,
XJ = X. sin a + X2cos a + </XJt
(28) 
x; = x„
X't = x4,
which is the general one leaving the origin О invariant, a “rotation” of 
about O. These rotations constitute a sub-group G3.
Example 3. 
Show that for (2.8) any point on the line X,: X,: X, • 
(psin?a - 4 cos Ja):(p cos Ja + q sinja): 2sin|a is invariant. (Hence, this line is the rotation 
axis.)
If we maintain the frame in S but choose another zero-position in E, we 
have in (2.1) a = p = q = 0. Hence ф' = ф + 0, у, = y2 - ~ 10, a'= 
r cos ф - 5 sin ф + a, b' = r sin ф 4- s cos ф + b and the new image point is 
given by
X; = X. cos 10 + X2 sin 1/3 - lX3(r cos 10 + s sin 1/3)
+ lX4(rsinl0 -s cos 10),

Example 4. 
Show that the fixed points of (2.9) belong to two lines, one in Vt through Л, the 
other in V2 through Jt.
A geometric interpretation of the transformation (2.9) will be given later.
In Euclidean three dimensional geometry the configuration of the fixed 
elements (the “absolutum”) consists of a plane and an imaginary conic in it; 
for non-Euclidean geometry it is a general quadric, real for hyperbolic, 
imaginary for elliptic geometry. In 1 '-geometry it consists of two imaginary 
planes. Hence the geometry in the image space of our mapping is not identical 
with one of the classical metric geometries. It may be considered as a 
borderline case of elliptic geometry and is therefore often called quasi-elliptic.
S'-geometry is a rather primitive one. Moreover it interests us only insofar 
as it is an image of plane kinematics. We introduce in S' the following 
concepts: the distance of two points, the angle of two planes, the parallelism 
of two lines.
We define the (angular) distance between two image points as follows: if A, 
is the image of the displacement D, (a„/?,;</>,), i = 1,2, the distance AtA2 is 
defined by (A|A2) = <t>2~ <t>i. In view of its kinematic meaning this is 
obviously a concept invariant for 2' transformations (2.6).
Example 5. 
Show that the distance between the image points with coordinates X„ Yt reads 
Ф = 2arctan[(X4Yi“ XjY4)/(XjYa+Х4У4)). Prove that it is invariant under transformation 
(2.6).
Example 6. 
Prove the following properties. If Ab A3, A> are collinear then (AtAj)+(A3Aa) 
+ (A>A,)-0; (A,Aa)« -(A3A,).
If the line A,A2 intersects I the distance (A|A2) = 0; the line is a null-line. 
The distance between any two points of a plane through 1 is zero; the plane is 
a null-plane. If U and W are two null-planes the distance from any point of U 
to any of W is always the same. (All this implies that spheres and circles are 
trivial configurations in X '-geometry.)
Example 7. 
If the line AtA2 intersects V, and V2 at S, and S2 write (AjA2) as a function of the 
cross-ratio (A,A3S|S3).
The absolutum of 2', consisting of the line 1, the two points JIt J2 on it and 
the two planes Vb Vt through it, is a self-dual configuration. Hence there is 
complete duality in 1 '-geometry (as in elliptic geometry, but not in Euclidean

geometry). Hence we may define the angle between two planes U and W in 
the same manner as the distance between two points. If U, and Wt are the 
coordinates of the planes we define their angle ф by
(2.10) Ф = 2arctan[(U2W,- I/, W2)/(Lr, W, + U2W2)).
Example 8. 
Two planes have angle zero (they are “X'-parallel”) if they intersect 1 at the same 
point.
Example 9. 
If the planes U and W intersect 1 at Tt and T3 write ^r(UW) as a function of the 
cross-ratio (J,J2T|T2).
We consider now two pencils of lines pj and p2. pi consists of the lines mi in 
Vj through J2, p? of the lines m2 in V2 through J». They have 1 in common, but 
all other lines are imaginary. If mj belongs to pi the conjugate imaginary' line 
belongs to p2.
Any (real) line q in 1’ has an intersection St with Vb S2 with V2, hence it 
intersects a line m. and the conjugate line m2. Conversely: the join of a point 
of Vi and the conjugate point of V2 is a real line.
We define two lines q and q', which are not null-lines, to be S'-parallel if 
they intersect the same lines m, and m2 of the pencils pi and p^; two null-lines 
are 2'-parallel if they have the same intersection with 1. Contrary to the 
situation in Euclidean space two parallel lines are in general skew. But they 
have some properties which justify the term parallel. From the definition it 
follows immediately that if qt, q2 are parallel and q2, q3 are parallel then qb q> 
are parallel; hence parallelism is a transitive property. Moreover: if q is a 
given line and О a given point there is always one line q' through Q parallel 
with q. Indeed, if q is not a null line it determines a line m, and the conjugate 
m2; q' is seen to be the unique line through Q intersecting both mt and m2, it is 
the (real) intersection of the planes (Q, mi) and (Q, m2). If q is a null-line, q' is 
the join of Q and the intersection of q and 1. Hence the parallel axiom is 
satisfied in 2'-geometry. All lines parallel to a given line, and therefore 
mutually parallel, constitute the lines of a linear congruence (an elliptic 
one, because the two common transversals are imaginary). These lines all 
have the same “2 '-direction”.

0)
Having now completed the introduction of some necessary metric concepts 
in 2' we can return to the set of transformations (2.8) and (2.9). For (2.8), the 
origin О and a line through it, mentioned in Example 3, are fixed.

STRAIGHT LINES IN THE IMAGE SPACE
401
Example 11. 
Verify that the phrase “rotation about the axis e“ is justified by proving that any 
plane through a is transformed into another through a; all transformed planes undergo the same 
change of angle from their former positions. Determine this “rotation angle”.
Example 12. 
Show that any plane through I is invariant for (2.8).
We consider now the £'-transformation (2.9). which resulted when we took 
another zero-position, leaving the frame in 1 unaltered. By (2.9) the origin О 
has gone to the point (r sin 10 - s cos J p, r cos J /3 + s sin 1 /3, 2sin 1 /3, 2cos J /3), 
this is the image point of the displacement D(r, s; /3). But this implies that all 
points of £' have moved the distance p from their original position. 
Moreover, it is easy to verify (for instance by means of the criterion of 
Example 10) that all lines through the points (Xb X2, X5, X4) and 
(Xi, XJ, XJ, XI) are £'-parallel. Hence by a transformation (2.9) all points of 
2? are moved the same distance along mutually parallel lines. Such a 
transformation may be called a “^'-translation”.
We have shown that two sets of transformations in X', both with a clear 
kinematical meaning are comparable to rotations and translations of Euclid­
ean space. We add that the general £'-transformation (2.6) is the product of a 
transformation from one set by one from the other set (as is obvious from 
their kinematical meaning); it is a £'-screw-mot ion. Such a motion has an axis 
a and is built up from a rotation about a and a translation, Z'-parallel with a. 
It has four fixed points: Л,Л and the intersections ShS2 of a and VbV2.

3. Straight lines in the image space
We have obtained some insight into the metric properties of X', and now 
we return to our starting point: the study of the image space as a map of plane 
kinematics. Our program will be twofold: on one hand we ask how certain 
phenomena in kinematics are represented by the mapping as properties in 2', 
on the other hand we investigate the kinematic meaning of certain configura­
tions in the image space. We start with the latter approach.
Obviously a set of n points of 2' corresponds to that of n finitely separated 
positions of E with respect to S; a curve к in 2' is the image of a continuous 
motion of the moving plane; a surface F in 2? corresponds to a motion with

two independent parameters. It is clear that not only projective properties of 
these configurations in 2' are of interest but also their metric ones, that is 
their behavior with respect to G6 or, what is the same thing, their positions 
with regard to the absolutum consisting of I, Jb Л, Vlt V2.
The displacements of E are defined with respect to a certain arbitrarily 
chosen zero-position which corresponds to the origin О in the image space. If 
O(Xi, X2, X3, X4) is an image point and X3 / 0, in view of (1.2), it corresponds 
to a displacement with center xp = Xi/Xj, yP = X2/X1 and the rotation angle Ф 
is given by tan J ф = Хд/Х4. Obviously the line OQ intersects the null-plane 
X3 = X4 at the point (xp, yp, 1,1). All points of a null-plane X3 = ЛХ4 
correspond to displacements with the same rotation angle. If X3 = 0 the point 
Q corresponds to a translation of E, for which according to (1.8) we have 
a = 2Xz/X4, b= - 2X]/X4, the rotation center is at infinity xp:yp:zp = 
X,:X2:0.
A line p in 2’, through Oy not in X> = 0, given by Xi: X2: X5 = pi: p2 : 
p3 / 0, corresponds to the set of all rotations about the same center (xp = 
p./p3, yP = рЛрз)- If p through О lies in X3 = 0 it corresponds to a set of 
mutually parallel translations of E, with variable displacements.
A line p not through O, not a null-line, would be the image of the set of 
rotations of E with center A2, say, if the zero-position O' had been chosen on 
p. By the displacement of E corresponding to the change of zero-position 
from O' to О let A2 be transformed into Ah Hence a point of p is the image 
of a displacement of E which transforms At into A2 followed by an arbitrary 
rotation about A2. The conclusion is: any point of p corresponds to a 
displacement of E for which A, is transformed into A2. The rotation centers 
are on the perpendicular bisector of Ab A2. That they are on a line is also 
seen directly in the map: the intersection of plane (O, p) and the plane 
X3 = X4 is a straight line. The same holds if p, not through O, is a null-line; 
moreover the rotation angle is now the same for all rotations. Such a line 
corresponds to a set of rotations the centers of which are on a line and they 
transform a point At at infinity into a point A3 again at infinity.
For any line p in the image space £' we have now determined the 
corresponding meaning in plane kinematics: it is associated with an ordered 
pair of points Ao, Ai of 2y and each point of p corresponds to a displacement 
which transforms the point of E with zero-position Ao to the position A,.
Our mapping considered in the other direction is one which represents the 
lines of three dimensional space by oriented point pairs of a plane. This leads 
to the study of line geometry by means of a plane map and has been 
extensively treated by MOller and Krupp a (1923].

corresponding rotation centers in £ is p„X + p^Y + pnZ = 0.

4. Curves in the image space
Any curve к in X*  is the image of a motion M of E with respect to S; it 
determines the motion completely and all the motion’s properties may be 
derived from the properties of this single curve k. If the points of к are given 
as functions of the time t the motion is also given with its time schedule. For 
now we restrict ourselves to geometric kinematics, not taking the time 
dependence into account.
If the coordinates of the points of к are given as functions of a parameter, 
the path of any point (x, y) of E for the motion M follows immediately from 
the fundamental equations (1.9). If к is an algebraic curve all paths are 
algebraic; if к is a rational curve all paths are rational. We shall call the motion 
algebraic and rational respectively. In this section we intend to derive the 
order and the circularity of the plane paths if the order n of the algebraic 
image curve к has been given; к is of course in general a space curve. The 
most simple case occurs if к does not intersect the singular line 1. Then all 
points of к represent displacements of E. From (1.9) it follows immediately 
that all paths have order 2n. Moreover к has n intersections with Vi; any 
point with X3 = iX4 however, as seen by direct substitution into (1.9), gives us 
X : Y : Z « 1: i : 0. The analogous result holds for V2. Hence the theorem: if 
the image curve к is an algebraic curve of order n which does not intersect I, the 
paths of all points of E for the corresponding motion M are curves of order 2n 
and circularity n.
If S is an intersection of к and V, its coordinates are (sh s2,1, - 0» and 5* 
being, in general, complex numbers. One of the intersections of к and V2 is S', 
the conjugate imaginary of S. The point S is the image of an isotropic 
displacement D*  (see Section 1), the center P of which in 1 is (sb s2). The path 
of any point of E has therefore a tangent at h coinciding with Pit and at I2 a 
tangent P'h (P‘ is the conjugate of P). In view of the properties of isotropic 
displacements any point of PI2 has the line Ph as part of its path, which is 
therefore degenerate. Analogously any point of P'h has P'h as a part of its 
path. It follows from this that the (real) intersection G of Ph and P'h has a

(CH. 11,<4
path to which the lines Ph and P'h belong. This means that the path of G is 
of order 2n - 2 and circularity n - 1. Obviously there are n points of E with this 
property. If two or more coincide the order of the path of such a point is 
further diminished.
For every path the (real) intersection F of Ph and P'h is the intersection of 
conjugate imaginary tangents to the path at h and h- It is therefore a special 
focus of every path.
*
 There are thus n special foci, they are the same for every 
path generated by the motion represented by k. Two corresponding points 
such as F and G are called the Laguerre-pair of the pair (P, P')\ they are the 
reflection of one another with respect to the (real) line PP'. It is possible that 
P and P' coincide; then F and G coincide at the same point. Summarizing we 
have: if the image curve к of a motion M has order n and does not intersect I, 
the path of a point of E is in general a n-circular curve of order 2n. There are n 
points of E for which the path is essentially a (n - l^circular curve of order 
(2n - 2). All paths have n special foci which are at the same points for all paths.
• Any tangent to a curve from I» intersects the corresponding tangent from h in a point called a 
focus of the curve. If the tangency occurs at I, and Z, respectively the intersection point is called a 
special (or singular, or principal, or Laguerre) focus.
Exceptional situations appear if к intersects 1. Such an intersection S is not 
the image of a displacement, but we shall investigate the behavior of a moving 
point of E in the limit as the point on к approaches S.
Let S = (si,s2,0,0) be a real point of intersection of к and I. If к has been 
given by X(r), t being a parameter, and if S.corresponds to t = 0, for small 
values of t we have
(4.1) 
Xt = Sj 4 ad, X2 ~ s2 4 a2t, Xy = a3l, X4 = a4t
(si, s2 not both zero, a4 not both zero). Substituting this in (1.9) we observe 
that X, Y, Z have the factor t ; dividing by t and restricting ourselves to linear 
terms we obtain
X = (a? - ai)tx - 2a3a4ty 4- 2[(sia3 + s2a4) + (а,аз4 a2a4)f]z,

for any finite point of E. As $iaj + 52a4 = s2a3- sxa4 = 0 would imply either 
s?4s2 = 0 or a?4ai = 0, both excluded, the conclusion is: all paths pass

through the same real point В at infinity. As seen from (4.2) the tangent at В 
depends on (x, y, z), hence the paths have in general different asymptotes 
at B.
If one intersection of к and Vj is on 1, there remain n - 1 intersections, not 
on 1, corresponding to isotropic D*  displacements, and similarly for V2. The 
conclusion is: if к has one real intersection with 1, the path of any point of E is 
a (n - l)-circular curve of order 2n - 1; with one real point at infinity which is 
the same for all paths generated by the motion k.
Example 19. Check the results so far for n s 1, the image curve being a line which does not or 
does intersect I.
The phenomenon of к intersecting 1 at a real point may occur more than 
once. If there are m real intersections (m < n - 1), the result is that the path 
of any point of E is a (n - m )-circular curve of order 2n - m. The m infinite, 
non-isotropic, points of the paths are the same for all paths. There are several 
sub-cases: two or more intersections of к and 1 may coincide (either because 
an intersection is a multiple point of k, or because 1 is a tangent of к to a 
certain order or a tangent at a multiple point of k). In all such cases the 
preceding results must be modified accordingly.
If a (real) curve к has imaginary intersections with 1 they appear in 
conjugate pairs. Suppose that к intersects 1 in two conjugate imaginary points 
S and S'. We suppose first that S, S' do not coincide with J2 and also that 
the tangents at S, S' are not in V! or V2. This implies that, making use of the 
notations of (4.1), we still have s? + s2/0, aJ+ai/0. Hence the above 
argument is valid and the result is: if k, of order n, has two conjugate 
imaginary intersections S, S' with 1, not coinciding with Л, J2 and such that the 
tangents of к at S, S' are not in Vi or V2, the paths of all points of E are 
(n - 2)-circular curves of order (2n - 2). Every path has the same two 
conjugate imaginary, non-isotropic, points at infinity. It is now easy to extend 
this to the case where к has more than one pair of imaginary intersections 
with 1.
In ail cases that follow we again take к to have two conjugate imaginary 
intersections with 1, denoted by S and S', while the tangents of к at S and S' 
are r and f respectively.
First, let 5 and S' not coincide with Л, Л» but let r be in Vt, and thus r' in 
V2. This implies that in (4.1), if t = 0 is the value of the parameter at S, we 
have a3 = ia4. Substituting this in (4.3) we obtain for В the point 
Uii + s2): (s2i - Si): 0 = (1: i: 0), that is h. Moreover, as seen from (4.2) the 
tangent at h is the line at infinity (Z = 0). The plane VI has n intersections

with k, but three are on 1 (S counted twice, S' counted once) and therefore 
n -3 intersections, not on I, correspond to displacements D*.
 But since В 
coincides with Jt the path is circular for two different reasons: one, as always, 
because к has points corresponding to isotropic positions, and the second 
because of its behavior with respect to 1. If the respective circularities are 
denoted by Ci and c2 respectively, we have in our case Ci = n - 3, c2 = 2, which 
gives as the complete circularity c of the path c = Ci + c2==n-l. The degree 
of the path is 2n - 2, for the path has no points at infinity outside Л, I2. If at 
the case at hand (r in Vb f in V2) we have moreover 5 = Л, S' = J2 we have
: s2 = 1: i, but that has no influence on the argument: the point В again 
coincides with Д. The result is different if S = J2, S' = Ji, then В is 
undetermined; this case must be dealt with specially.
Before doing this we consider the situation where S = Jb S' = J2 while r 
and r' are not in Vt or V2. In (4.1) we have now Si: s2 = 1: i (if t = 0 is the 
parameter value of Л), but a?+aJ/0. For В we obtain X:K:Z = 
(аэ+ ia4):(ia3- a4):0 = 1: i :0, that is Л once more, but the tangent at 
does not coincide with the line at infinity. The conclusion is c} = n - 2, c2 = 1, 
c - n - 1.
The last case we must investigate is: S = Jb S' = J2, r lies in V2, f in Vb Or 
(if t = 0 gives Ji): Si: s2 = 1: i, a3: a4 = - i: 1, which means that in (4.2) all 
terms without t are zero and the limit for t 0 is senseless. It is clear that the 
representation of к in the neighborhood of 1 must be given up to second order 
terms in t. It we put Sj = s, s2 = is, a3 = - ia, a4 = a, we have
X, = s + att + pj2, X2 = is + a2t + &2t\
(4,4J 
X3 = - iat + ДэН, X. = at + fitt\
Substituting this in the equations (1.9) of the paths we obtain, after dividing by 
Г2, and then letting t—>0
X = a2x + ia2y 4- [s(034- i/34)+ a(a2- iat)]z,
(4.5) У = - ia2x 4-a2y +(is(/33+ i/34)- ia(a2~ iai)]z, 
Z = 0.
Hence if the point on к approaches Ji the path in S tends to a point at infinity. 
The point at infinity depends on (x, y, z) and is therefore, in general, different 
for different paths. (Those points of E lying on a line through h go to the 
same point.) For J2 we obtain the analogous result. The number of intersec­
tions of к and Vi, not on 1, is n - 3 (because two coincide with J2 and one with 
Ji). Hence Ci = n - 3, c2 = 0, c = n - 3; the order of a path is 2(n - 3) 4- 2 s 
2n-4.

5. Plane Image curves
In this section we determine those motions M of E which correspond to 
image curves к which are plane curves.
It should be noted that the origin О of the image space S' is an arbitrarily 
chosen point. If we investigate the motion corresponding to a given image 
curve к we may always take О at a point of k. This means that one of the 
positions of E during its motion is singled out as the zero-position.

A MAPPING OF PLANE KINEMATICS
(CH. 1135
Let U be the plane of k. Then U passes through O. If U is the plane X> = 0, 
all points correspond to translations; a curve к in it represents a genera! 
translalory motion, wherein all the paths are congruent. For a general plane 
U containing к and not passing through 1, the plane X3 = X4 intersects U in a 
straight line s'. Each point of U lies on a line u' connecting О and one point of 
s'. The line pencil (O, u') completely covers U. We know, from Section 3, that 
all the points of any one line u' have only one rotation center Xp, Ур. Since the 
points of s' have the coordinates (Xp, Ур, 1,1), see Section 3, it follows that 
there is a linear relationship between Xp and Ypy hence all the rotation centers 
(in 2) lie on one line s in 2. The conclusion is then that the points of U 
correspond to the set D of °°2 displacements of E for which the locus of the 
rotation center P is a straight line, s of J, the rotation angles being arbitrary'.
The points of к correspond to a continuous subset of D. Hence к 
corresponds to a motion M of the following type: any position of E is 
obtained by rotating the zero-position about a center P on s, the rotation 
angle ф being a continuous (and, in general, many valued) function of P.
We know from Chapter VIII that the rotation about P can always be 
considered as the product of the reflections into two lines through P (the 
angle between them being 1ф). As the first of these lines we take s, which 
passes through P, and for the second line we take a line through P making an 
angle of ф/2 with s, we denote this line as s(<£). There will be a line s(<£) 
corresponding to each point of k. We denote the envelope of the lines s(<£) as 
the plane curve K, in 2, hence s(<£) are the tangents of K; s is one of them. 
s(0) = s. The displacements of E may be found as follows: reflect the zero 
position into the fixed tangent s of K, and reflect the result into an arbitrary 
tangent of K. If K' is the reflection of К into s, a set of positions of K' are 
obtained by reflecting К into the set of its own tangents. However, each such 
position of К is a position of E (since it can also be obtained if we consider K' 
a curve of E and reflect it twice from the zero-position, first about s and then 
about s(</>)). We recognize the general symmetrical motion of E (Chapter IX, 
Section 8), К being the fixed and K' the moving centrode. Hence, a plane 
image curve corresponds to a symmetrical motion of E, and conversely a 
symmetrical motion has a plane image curve.
If the image curve к is of order n, any line through O, in U, has n points in 
common with it (O being one of them); hence to any rotation center P, in 2, 
there belong n values of ф (Ф = 0 being one of them); through P pass 
therefore n lines s(<£) (s itself being one of them). The conclusion is: the 
centrodes К and K' are of class n.
The plane U of к has one (real) point of intersection S with I. In general S is

not on к; if к passes m times through S (0 < m c n ~ 1) the path of a point of 
E for the corresponding (symmetrical) motion is, according to (4.7), a 
(л - m ^circular curve of order 2n - m.
•
6. Quadratic motions
A motion is quadratic if the image curve is a (non-degenerate) conic, and 
hence a plane curve in a plane U. In view of Section 5, all quadratic motions 
are symmetrical, the centrodes К and K' are curves of the second class and 
therefore conics. In general к has no intersection with 1; then the paths are in 
view of (4.7) rational bicircular quartic curves. If к has a point S in common 
with 1 (S being the intersection of 1 and U), we have m = 1: the paths are 
rational circular cubic curves with one real point at infinity, the same for all 
paths. If Q is any point on к the intersection of OQ and the plane X3 = X4 
gives us the point (xp, zp, zp) and thus the coordinates of the rotation center 
P of the displacement represented by Q. Therefore the intersection of 
X3 = X4 and the tangent of К at О gives us the instantaneous rotation center 
of the zero-position, which is a point of the centrode K. This point is at infinity 
if the tangent represents a translation; which is the case if it passes through S 
(which gives zp = 0). As О can be chosen arbitrarily on к the conclusion is that 
К has a point at infinity if some tangent of к passes through S. Hence К is an 
ellipse if S is inside k, a hyperbola if S is outside к and a parabola if S is on k.
If к does not pass through S it has two intersections with Vi (and V2) not on 
I. The corresponding motion has two isotropic positions. In view of Section 4 
there are two points of E with paths which (each) contain two isotropic lines; 
hence there are two points which each have a path which is a circle. The 
analogous argument shows that in case к passes through S there is one point 
of E with a straight line path.
We have now derived by means of our mapping the most important 
properties of the motion defined by the rolling of a conic on a symmetrical 
conic. In Chapter IX we used the order of the point paths to name the motion. 
In this chapter we often use the image curve’s order instead.
7. Displacements for which one point stays on a circle

E to which they correspond. We now study the mapping in the other 
direction: we start from some given motions and derive their images in In 
classical plane motions, such as we dealt with in Chapter VIII, one or more 
points of the moving plane describe circles. Therefore we investigate first of 
all those displacements of E for which a given point A is permanently on a 
given circle c of 1. As this means one condition for the motion, we may expect 
the image to be a certain surface in If (XB, X2, X3, X4) is an image point the 
displacement of E is given by the fundamental relations (1.9) from which
X2 + У2 = (X? + X2)2(x2 + у2) - 4(X? + Xj)(X,X3 - X2X4)xz 
(71) 
- 4(X2, + X2.)(X2X,+ X.XJyz + 4(Xj+ Xi)(X2>+ X^z1.
So that if A is (x, y, z), and the equation of the circle c is
(7.2) 
Co(X2 + У2) + 2GXZ + 2C2 YZ + C3Z2 = 0,
the displacements for which A is always on c satisfy X2 + X2 = 0 (which is 
trivial) or
H s Coz2(X? + X?) + (- Ox + Gz )zX,X3 + (- Coy + C2z )zX2X3
+ (- Coy - C2z)zX,X4 + (CoX + C,z )zX2X4 + (- Gy + C2x)zX>X4 
(7,3) + \[C0(x2+y2)-2Clxz -2Czyz + C>z2]X'}
+ \[C„(x2+y2)+2C,xz +2C,yz + C,z2]X2t=0.
This represents a quadric surface H; the coefficients depend on the ratios of 
Co, Ci, C2, Cj and on those of x, y, z. Hence (7.3) is a system of ®5 quadrics. It 
obviously is not a linear system.
To study the surface H we choose the origin О on it (then the last term of 
(7.3) vanishes) or, what is the same condition, A is on c at the zero-posit ion. 
Furthermore we take the frame in E and J such that G = G = 0, C0C3 < 0, 
which may be done without any loss of generality if c is a real, non­
degenerate, circle. Then for z / 0 (which means that A is a finite point of E) 
we obtain for (7.3) (provided C0(x2 + y2) + C3z2 = 0),
(7.4) 
z (X? + X?) - x(X,X3 - X2X4) - у (X2X3 + X,X4) = 0,
which is therefore the equation of H for a suitably chosen zero-position and a 
suitably chosen frame in E and X. The discriminant of (7.4) is(x2+ y2)2; hence 
H is a general quadric. Furthermore, if X3 = X4 = 0 we obtain X2 + X22=0 
which implies that H passes through and J2. If X3 = iX4 we have
z (X} + XI) + ((- ix - у )Xj + (x - iy )X2)X4 = 0,

or
(7.5) 
(- iX, + X2)[izX, + zX2 + (x - iy )X4] = 0.
This implies that the intersection of H and Vj degenerates into two lines, 
intersecting at the point T - (ix + y, - x + iy,2iz,2z), the two lines being Th 
and TJ2. In the same manner we may prove that the intersection of H and V2 
consists of the two lines T'J2 and TV,, T being the conjugate imaginary to T.
If a quadric passes through Jx and J2, having V! and V2 as tangent planes it 
must satisfy four conditions. There are quadrics in space, therefore there 
are ®5 quadrics with these properties.
If c is a degenerate real circle it may be given the equation Y = 0, which 
implies у = 0 if A is on c for the zero-position. Hence Co = G = C3 = 0, 
C2/0 and the equation (7.3) is seen to be
(7.6) 
zX2X3 - (zX. - xX3)X4 = 0,
which shows that the locus which we denote for this case by H*  is again a 
non-singular quadric. It contains the line 1. The intersection with Vj consist of 
1 and the line X3- iX4 = zXx - i(zX2- xX4) = 0, which passes through J2; the 
intersection of H*  and V2 consists of 1 and a line through Jx. Summing up we 
have: the locus of the image points of those displacements of E for which a 
given point A of E is on a given circle c of £, is a quadric H, passing through 
Jx and J2 and tangent to V, and V2 at the points T and T'. If c degenerates into 
a finite straight line, T coincides with J2 and T' with Jb and 1 is a generator 
of H.
Example 21. Determine the system of special quadrics H
*,
 corresponding to displacements 
for which A stays on a straight line (take Co * 0 in (7.3)).
The quadric H with equation (7.4) contains the (real) line X, = X2 = 0; it is 
therefore a hyperboloid. The same holds for (7.6) because 1 is on it. The 
conclusion is that H in the general and in the special case contains two sets of 
real generators.
The question arises then as to the meaning of these sets on the kinematical 
side of the mapping. We know that a line of S' corresponds to the set of all 
displacements of E for which a point A, is displaced to A2, Ai and A2 being 
two fixed points.
Let c be the circle in I, Ao the zero-position of the moving point and A 
another position. If Ao and A are on c obviously any rotation which displaces 
Ao into A has its image on H. The set, G, of these rotations, however, 
corresponds to a line g of and thus one of the sets of generators of the

412
A MAPPING OF PLANE KINEMATICS
[CH. 11.17
hyperboloid is accounted for. A generator g corresponds to a set of rotations 
the centers of which are on a line through the center M of c (Fig. 88). Two 
such sets of rotations G» and G2 have no common element: two generators gb 
g2 are mutually skew.
The meaning of the second set may be found as follows. Let m be any line 
through Ao (Fig. 89), M’ the reflection of M into m. Consider all rotations 
which displace M' into M. If P on m is the center of such a rotation, the 
rotation angle must be M'PM. It displaces Ao into its reflection into the radius 
PMy and therefore into a point A on the circle. Hence the rotations G*  
displacing M' into M correspond to a generator g'on H. Any line m through 
Ao gives rise to such a generator. Two sets G > and G'2 have no rotation in 
common, which implies that the corresponding generators g] and g2 are skew. 
All rotations of a set G displace Ao into the same point, those of a set G' 
displace Ao into a variable point of c. Hence a set G and a set G' have one 
displacement in common; two generators g and g' intersect.
Example 22. Determine the set G and the set G' to which the identical displacement belongs; 
they correspond to the two generators of H through the origin O.
Example 23. Determine the two sets of displacements of E corresponding with the generators 
of the special hyperboloid H*.

8. The general four-bar motion
We obtain a four-bar motion of E if a point A i of E is compelled to stay on 
a circle (Mg Rt) of 2, and a second point A2 on a second circle (M2; R2)- In 
view of the results of the preceding section we obtain: a four-bar motion of E 
is mapped on the intersection k4 of two quadrics Hi and H2; k4 is the 
well-known quartic space curve of the first kind.
Hj and H2 both pass through J, and J2; hence k4 passes through and J2. 
The tangents n and r2 at these points, however, are not in V, or V2.
Example 26. Show that r, lying in V| or V2 would imply that Mt and M2 are not both either real 
or coinciding.
Therefore the behavior of k4 with respect to the absolutum is such that it 
belongs to type IV of (4.6). As и = 4 we have N = 6, m4 = 1, ct = 2, c2 = 1, 
c = 3: the paths of the moving points are tricircular curves of order 6. The 
general k4 is a curve of genus 1, i.e., an elliptic curve; any path is therefore,

Ct = 2 there are two points of E with paths which degenerate into two 
isotropic lines and a curve of order 4. These points are seen to be A । and A2, 
the paths of which are the circles with centers at Mi and M2 respectively, each 
counted twice.
We shall derive a parametric representation of the image curve and (by

point of E. We know beforehand that we need elliptic functions. Let the 
centers of the circles be Mi = (-Jg,O), M2 = (}g,0), (g >0); the radii are R> 
and R2. We take the frame in E such that for Ai: x = - Jh, у = 0, and for Atz 
x = у = 0, (h > 0). The lengths of the four bars are MiM2 = g, MiAi = 
M2A2= R2, AiA2- h. For the coefficients of the circle with center M, we 
have CQ= 1, Ct-2g, C2 = 0, C3 = lg2- R\, and analogously for the circle 
centered at M2. From (7.3) it follows that the corresponding quadrics in Z' are

They satisfy the following relations

D2 = F2 + 2(g - h )2F2 = S,S2T}Tt.

For the special case g = h we have (if R, / R2) A3 = (R24- R22)( - R2|4- R2^-1, 
A4 = oo.
Example 27. 
Show that D, - D2 = 8gh (gJ+ ha- R’- R’).
A four-bar with sides g, h, RH R2 is only physically realizable if the length 
of every side is less than the sum of the remaining three. Hence we have 
always S, >0 (i = 1,2,3,4) and moreover T> >0.
The twisted quartic curve is of the general type if the four roots are 
mutually different. It is easy to verify that A>, A2 are both unequal to A3 or A4. 
Therefore, two roots are only equal if D}D2 - 0, which implies T27\T4 = 0; in 
this case the sum of the lengths of two bars is equal to the sum of the other 
two.

From (8.10) it follows: if T2>0, T3T4>0, all roots are real; if T2T3T4<0. 
two are real and two imaginary; if T2 < 0, T3T4 < 0, all roots are imaginary.
We consider first the general case of four different roots A.. For rheir 
cross-ratio we obtain
6 = (A>A2A3A4) = (A4“ A2)(A3AJ(A3 ~ A2) 1 (A4 — Ai) *,  
and after some algebra
(8.12) 
5 = [G - (ST)"2] [G 4- (ST)1'2] \
or in view of (8.9),
(8.13) 
6 = [(S,z2- T,,2)(S,Z24 T,/2)-’]2,
by which formula the characteristic cross-ratio of the quartic curve k4 has been 
expressed in terms of the lengths of the four bars. If T > 0 (that is if the roots 
are either all real or all imaginary) 6 is real; if T < 0, 8 is a number of the unit 
circle of the complex plane.
For A = A, equation (8.4) is satisfied, and HJ + A<HJ = 0 (i = 1,2,3,4) are 
therefore the four quadratic cones through k4. For the time being we suppose 
g/ h. Then the four vertices are [A,(g + Л),0, - 4,0], [A2(g + Л),0, - 4.0], 
[0, A3(g - h ),0, - 4], [0, A4(g - h),0, - 4]; they are mutually conjugate points 
with respect to any quadric through k4, or, in other words, the vertices of their 
common polar tetrahedron.
In the following, the equation for the pencil of quadrics through k4 is 
studied for the case of four real roots A„ the conditions being T2 > 0, T3T4 > 0. 
For this case it follows from their definition (8.11) that Aj>A2, A4>A3. 
Furthermore (8.13) implies that 0< 8 < 1, from which it follows that on the 
A-axis the intervals A2<A <Ai and A3<A < A4 have no common points. 
Further study (for instance, by considering g —> h) shows that the first interval 
is to the left (right) of the second if < R2 (Ri > R2). The two cranks MiAt 
and M2A2 play equivalent roles in the configuration, so we may without any 
loss of generality suppose R, < R2. This implies that A, satisfy the following 
inequalities
(8.14) 
A2 < A j < A3 < A4.
Example 28. 
Show that the roots A, cannot be real and different if R, » R,.
As T3 + T4 = 2(Ri - R2) the inequality Ri < R2 implies T3<0, T4< 0 and 
therefore, by Grashof’s well-known criteria, we have a crank-rocker motion.
As A, are real, the vertices of the four cones are real. We take them as the

the coupler curve generated by any point of the moving plane.

the corresponding isotropic rotations.

Consider the case g =  h, excluded so far. Show that the vertices of the four cones 
are [2gA i, 0, - 4,0], [2gA2t 0. - 4,0|, [0,0,0.1 ] and (0,1.0,0). Determine the parametric equations 
of k4 for this case.
*
From the analytical geometry of quadrics, it follows that if the four 
eigenvalues of a pencil are all real the quartic curve consists of two circuits. 
This implies that all coupler curves of our crank-rocker motion have the same 
property.
There are two other cases of four distinct eigenvalues which arise when 
there are two imaginary or four imaginary roots. These cases can be worked 
out by means of elliptic functions in a similar manner. The curve k4 has then 
only one circuit and so have the corresponding coupler curves.
Example 32. If two roots are imaginary we have the following possibilities: T2>0, 7\<0. 
T4>0; T2>0, T5>0, T4<0; Tj<0, T,<0, T4<0. Determine the corresponding types of 
motion of the four-bars for each of these three sub-cases
Example 33. 
If all roots are imaginary there are two sub-cases: T3<0, T»<0. T4>0; T2<0, 
7\>0, T4<0. Determine the corresponding types of motion.
9. Folding four-bars
In the preceding section we supposed the four roots A, to be different. We 
deal now with the special four-bars for which T = T|T2T3T4 = 0, which 
implies that the sum of two sides is equal to the sum of the other two; hence 
the four-bar has a folding position: this is the position at which the points Mif 
M2, Ai, A2 are collinear. For the time being we suppose that only one of the 
expressions T2, T3, T4 is equal to zero; then two roots A( are equal, but

different from both of the other two. In this case the quadrics Hi and H2 have 
a tangent point and their intersection is a quartic curve of the first kind, with a 
double point and hence a rational curve. The motion is rational, all point­
paths are rational tricircular curves of order six.
There are several sub-cases: any of the three expressions T2, Тъ Т< can be 
zero, and further discussion depends on the signs of the other two. All cases 
may be dealt with in a similar manner. We restrict ourselves to one example: 
let T4 - 0; then in view of < R2 we have T3 < 0; let us suppose furthermore 
T2>0. Hence
g + R2 = h 4- R}
(91) 
g + h>R,+ R2,
and therefore h > R2, g > R,t g - h <0.
From this it follows that in the folding position the four vertices are in the 
order MiAtM2A2 (Fig. 90). We choose in 2 the same frame as before, such 
that Mr = (-lg,0), M2 = (Jg,0). If we take the collinear position as the 
zero-position, we have furthermore A, = (- Jg 4- Ri,0), A2 = (|g + R2,0) 
which implies AtA2 = h. Using these coordinates for A,, the equations of the 
quadrics in the image space which express that A. is on circle ; R,) are in 
analogy to (8.1):
H. - 4(X’ 4- XI)4- 4(g - R,)Х,Хз + 4R ,X2X< + g(g - 2R,)X23 = 0. 
(9'2) н2 = 4(X? + X?) - 4(g + R2)X,X, + 4R2X2X4 + g(g + 2R2)X2, = 0.
Both quadrics pass through the origin O, and their common tangent plane at 
this point is X2 = 0. Of the four eigenvalues of the pencil H, 4- ЛН2, two are 
equal to - Ri/R2, the others are the roots of

the discriminant of which is 4gh(g - Ri)(g + R2)>0; hence the two other 
cones are real. The cone (counted twice) with vertex О has the equation

with
(9.6) 
e1J = g(R1 + R2)± 2(ghR, R 2),л.
They are the two (real) tangents pH p2 of k4 at О; clearly О is therefore a node 
of k4. To derive a parametric representation of k4 we intersect it with the 
pencil of planes through p,:
(9.7) 
2(R2- R,)X2 = t[2(R2- R,)X, + e.X3],
every plane of this pencil intersects k4 in the point O, counted three times. If 
(9.7) is substituted into (9.4) the result is
(9.8) 
[2(R2- R,)X, + eiX3J[2(R2- R,)(l + z2)X, + (e2+ e,Z2)X3] = 0.
The second factor gives us, with proportionality factor a, 
aX1 = e2 + £|Z2, aX3 = - 2(R2- R,)(l + Z2), 
while from (9.7) it follows that <rX2 = (e2 - e,)z; X4 may be found after 
substitution of Xi, X2, X3 into the equation of any quadric through k4, 
different from (9.4), for example H!-H2 = 0. This gives us the following 
representation of the (rational) curve k4,
X1 = (e2-el)Z (e2 + e,Z2),
X2 = (e2-e,)2z2,
(9-9) X, = - 2(R2 - R,)(e2 - e,)t (1 + t2),
X. = - 2(1 + I2) [ (g + h)(e2 + e,r2) + g(R22-R?)(l + »’)]■
Example 34. 
Show that (9.9) has a double point at О and passes through J,, J3.
Substituting (9.9) into (1.9), we obtain a rational parametric representation 
of all coupler curves of the motion. As X3 and X4 both have the factor (1 + z2) 
all terms of (1.9) will have this factor, and hence these curves are indeed of 
order six.
Example 35. 
Derive the equations for the coupler curves and determine the three values of i at

Example 37. 
Show that p, and p2 correspond to the two instantaneous centers of the motion for

The motion we considered was that of a simple folding four-bar T4 = 0, 
T2 / 0, T) / 0. The cases for which either T2 = 0 or T3 = 0, the other being 
unequal to zero, can be dealt with in a similar manner.
A more special motion arises if two of the expressions are zero: the 
four-bar may fold in two different ways. As seen from (8.10), T3 and T4 play 
equivalent roles, different from that of T2. Therefore two main cases must be 
considered: T2 = 0 and T3 or T4 is zero, and T3 = T4 = 0.
In the first case we have from (8.10) Di = D2 = 0; the Л-equation of Hi and 
H2 has two pairs of equal roots. Hence k4 has two double points and is 
therefore degenerate. We suppose T2 = 0, T4 = 0, T3 / 0 which implies 
Rt = g, R2 = h, h / g; two pairs of adjacent sides of the four-bar are equal.
Making use of the coordinate systems introduced above for the simple 
folding four-bar, the quadrics (9.2) become
Hi « 4(Xf 4- X22) + 4gX2X4 - g2X23 = 0,
(910) H2 - 4(X2 + X}) — 4(g + h )X,X, + 4hX2X4 + g(g + 2h )X\ = 0,
and the eigenvalues are A, = A2 = - g/Л, A3 = A4 = g/h. The two cones of the 
pencil, each counted twice, are
hH,-gH2-4(ft - g)(X| + X|) +4g(A +g)X.X,
-g!(g+3h)X^0,
(9л1) hH, + gH2» 4(Л + g)(X? + X|) - 4g(h + g)X,X, + 8gftX2X4
+ g\h +g)X| = 0.
Their vertices are respectively О and O' = (g,0,2,0). It is easy to verify that 
their join X2 » 0, 2X, - gX3 = 0 is on both cones. Hence k4 degenerates into 
the line OO' and a twisted cubic k3 through О and O'. Any plane 
2X2 = t (2Xt - gX3) through this chord has one more point in common with 
kj, which is seen to be
X, = g((A-g)(l + f)-4/Ip.
X2 = -4ght\
<?12) 
X, = 2(h-g)(l + r2)t,
X. = 2(Л + g)(l + r’),
and thus a parametric representation for k3 has been found.

A MAPPING OF PLANE KINEMATICS
[CH. 11,19
Our conclusion is that the motion (of the type with two folding positions 
being considered) degenerates into a trivial rotation, the image of which is the 
line OO\ and the essential part, a cubic motion whose image is k3.
Example 38. 
Verify that the “trivial” rotation is about the center M2.
For t = ± i, k3 passes through Jx and J2\ for r = 0 it passes through O, and 
for t = oo through O', these being the collinear positions. The tangents of k3 at 
Ji and J2 are not in V| or V2; hence, in view of the formulas (4.6), the paths of 
the cubic motion are rational bicircular curves of order four. The coupler 
curve for any point of E may be found by substituting (9.12) into (1.9), 
keeping in mind that both X3 and X4 have (1 + f2) as a factor.
Example 39. 
Derive from (9.12) the relation between the parameter t and the rotation angle Ф 
of the corresponding displacement. Show that ф = 0 and ф = it correspond to О and O'.
The preceding four-bar with two folding positions was characterized by 
T2 = T4 = 0; as we mentioned before the case T2 = T3 = 0 is completely 
similar. Quite another case arises if T3 = T4 = 0, T2/ 0, which implies g = Л, 
Rt = R2 (= R); opposite sides of the four-bar are equal. We have Dy /0, 
D2 = 0, which means A3 = A4 but Ai and A2 are not equal.
We now choose the coordinate system as we did in Section 8, for the case of 
the general four-bar, which implies = 
M2 = (jg,0), Ai =
(~ig, 0), A2 = (4g,0). The two quadrics (8.1) are now
И, = 4(X? + X2) + 4gX,X3 + (g2 - RW- RaXi = 0, 
<9-13) H2» 4(X; + X2) - 4gX.X, + (g1 - R 2)X\ - R 'X\ = 0.
We have A3 = A4 = - 1, and the corresponding quadric Hi - H2 = 0 is seen to 
be XlX3 = 0, which means that this (doubly counted) cone degenerates into 
the planes Xi = 0 and X3 = 0. Hence k4 degenerates into two conics k2 and k2 
(with two common points), and the corresponding motion degenerates into 
two quadratic motions (such as considered in Section 6). kJ, in X3 = 0, 
corresponds to a set of translations. k2 is the image of a symmetric motion, the 
centrodes of which are conics. There are two cases, depending upon whether 
g > R or g < R. In the first case k2 is an ellipse while the centrodes are 
hyperbolas, whereas if g < Rk2 is a hyperbola and the centrodes are ellipses 
(which is in accordance with the criterion given in Section 6). We recognize in 
the two aggregrates of k4 the images of a parallelogram and an antiparallelo­
gram motion of E. The complete path of a point consists of a circle and a 
rational bicircular curve of order four.
The most special four-bar is that for which T2 = T3 = T4 = 0, which means

THE SLIDER-CRANK MOTION
423
g = h = Rt = R2. In (9.13) the term X] vanishes; k, degenerates into two 
straight lines, corresponding to rotations. Every path consists of three circles.
Example 40. 
The reader who is familiar with the projective classification of quartic space curves 
by means of elementary divisors can verify that the general four-bar corresponds to the Segre 
symbol [1 1 1 1]; the singly folding corresponds to [2 1 1], and the doubly folding of the first kind to 
122]. that of the second kind to ((1 1)1 1|, and the last one to [(1 1)2].
10. The slider-crank motion
Until now we have dealt with four-bars where two points of E describe 
non-degenerate circles in S. We consider now the case in which one circle is a 
straight line.
In Section 7 we proved that the image surface of those positions of E for 
which one of its points is constrained to remain on a line of 5 is a hyperboloid 
H*,
 not only passing through and J2 but, moreover, having V2 and V! as 
tangent planes at these points; I is a generator of H’. If the point A, of E 
remains on a non-degenerate circle Ci = (M;R) and the point A2 on the 
straight line m, the corresponding motion is a slider-crank motion. It is that 
special case of a four-bar in which M2 is at infinity (in the direction 
perpendicular to m) and R2 = The image curve к of such a motion is the 
intersection of a general hyperboloid of type H and a special one H*.
 Hence к 
is a quartic space curve of the first kind, elliptic in general, passing through J, 
and J2i such that its tangents r and r' at these points are in V2 and V, 
respectively. In view of Table (4.6), the curve к is one of type V. Hence N = 4, 
c = 1, d = 2; the paths for the slider-crank motion are elliptic curves of order 
4, with simple points at Л, I2, and with two other points at infinity which are in 
general different for different paths. In order to describe the motion analyti­
cally we take the frames in 1 and E such that Ci is the circle (0,0; Я), m the 
line Y - h' = 0 (h' > 0), A, = (0,0), A2 = (/i,0). Then the quadrics on which 
the image point is situated are (in view of (7.3)),

similar to that used for the general four-bar. From this would follow the 
parametric equations for any path.
It is easy to see that the slider-crank mechanism is real if and only if 
h 2*  | R - fc'|. From this it follows U\ >0, (Л^О, Uy Э0. Hence there are two 
main cases: U4 >0, U4< 0. In the first case all A, are real, in the second A,, X2 
are real, A3, A4 are conjugate imaginary. In the first case k4 consists of two 
circuits and the same holds for any path; in the latter there is only one circuit.
Example 41. 
Show that the cross-ratio of the image curve is

Show that they are determined by (x  + y2- 2hx + h2)X2 + 4hyXY + (xa4- y2 + 2hx + h)Y

Determine the points Q„ Q3 for A„ and for A2. Prove that the points Qlt Q3 are, in general, 
conjugate imaginary, and that the locus of the points of E for which Qt, Q3 coincide is the circle 
(Aa; h) (compare Example 20). The path of such a point has an isolated double point at infinity; 
determine this point.
*
*
A special slider-crank is one in which m passes through the center of the 
circle M; it is the so-called in-line type. Then h' = 0 and the equation of H 
and H*,
 and the roots A, are simplified. It belongs to the first case if R > h, 
and to the second if R < h. The image curve and the paths are still elliptic.
Example 45. 
Determine the roots A„ the reduced equations of H, H

 and the parametric 
representation of к and of all paths, in the case h' - 0.

Show that the cross-ratios of к in the case Л'«0 read h2/R3, R3/h3, - u2/R\

The slider-crank has a folding position if U4 = h — h' - R =0. Then there 
exists a position at which Мь A,, A2 and the point M2 at infinity are collinear. 
We have now in view of (10.4): A3 = A4. The image curve has a double point 
(corresponding to the folding position); к and all paths are rational.

11. Elliptic motion
A still more special case appears if both circles of the four-bar configuration 
are straight lines. If A) is constrained to move on the line mi in J, and A2 on 
the line m2, the image curve of the motion is the intersection of two special 
hyperboloids HT and H2. Since both hyperboloids have 1 as a generator (the 
points of 1 do not correspond to positions of E) this image curve is in general a 
twisted cubic k3.
Furthermore, since both HT and H*  have at Jt the tangent plane V2 and at 
Л the tangent plane Vb their intersection k3 passes through Ji and J2, its 
tangents r, f at these points lie in V2 and V,. Hence k3 is a curve of type V of 
Table (4.6); and as n = 3 we obtain N = 2, c = 0, d = 2. The paths of the 
motion are conics and their points at infinity Qt, Q2 are in general different 
for different paths. All quadrics of the pencil HT + AH? are special hyper­
boloids H*,
 and as k3 lies on all of these, there are »' points of E which 
remain on a fine of 2. Furthermore the equation (7.3) is linear in C, and 
therefore these lines are those of a pencil of lines in X.
Omitting the trivial case where mb m2 are parallel, we may without loss of 
generality suppose them to be the lines Y = 0 and X = 0. If Af = (p,0), 
A2 = (-p,0) we have from (7.3)
HT = - X,X4 + X2X3 + pX3X4 = 0,
H! - X,X, + X2X4 + ip(Xj- Xj) = 0.

THE INVERSE OF A FOUR BAR MOTION
427
12. The inverse of a four-bar motion
The general relationship between a motion and its ipverse, as it presents 
itself in the image space, will be dealt with in Section 14. We consider here the 
inverse of the four-bar motion. If the point A of E is constrained to move on 
the circle c(M; R) in 2, the relative motion of E and 2 is such that the point 
A of E and the point M of J remain at the constant distance R. Hence the 
inverse motion is such that M of J moves on the circle (A ; R) in E. Its image 
surface is therefore a hyperboloid H of the set (7.3).
We have seen in Section 10 that if c is a straight line this surface is a special 
one: it is a hyperboloid H*  tangent to Vt and V2 at J2 and J, respectively.
The inverse of this motion, however, is different from the direct motion. It 
is defined by the condition that a line m of E passes permanently through a 
fixed point P of S. Let m be the line их + vy + wz = 0, P the point ab 
Making use of the formulas of the inverse motion (Section 1; Example 1) the 
condition is seen to be

which represents a hyperboloid passing through Jb J2 such that the tangent 
planes at these points are V, and V2 respectively. Hence, in comparison with 
H*,
 the planes are interchanged.
This result enables us to derive the image curves of some classical plane 
motions.
If the point A of E is constrained to move on a circle in S and a line m of E 
to pass through a point P of Z, the image curve of the motion is the 
intersection of a general hyperboloid H and a special one H
**
.
 The image 
curve is then a quartic curve k4, which is elliptic in general and passes through 
Л, Л, the tangents at these points lie in V,, V2 respectively. Hence k4 is of type 
IV in Table (4.6). We have n = 4, N = 6, c = 3, d = 0. This motion is the 
inverse of the slider-crank motion. Its paths are elliptic, tricircular curves of 
order six.
If a point A of E moves on a line s( of J, and a line s of E passes through a 
point P of J, the image curve is the intersection of a special hyperboloid H*
 
and a special hyperboloid H
**
.
 As both have 1 as a generator, the intersection 
is a twisted cubic k3. To discuss its position with respect to 1 we introduce 
coordinates systems such that A = (0,a\ 1), P = (0,p, 1), s = у = 0, Si = Y = 
0. Then from (7.3)

N = 4, c = 1, d = 2. The paths are rational circular curves of order four; the 
two non-isotropic points at infinity are the same for all paths. The inverse of 
the motion is of the same type.

13. Cycloidal motions
A cycloidal motion is defined as a motion for which both the fixed and 
moving centrodes are circles. Let the fixed circle, in 2, be (M;R) and the 
moving one, in E, be the circle (m; r). The zero-position is taken as the 
position at which the my-axis and the My-axis coincide. We take the two 
circles to be externally tangent (Fig. 84, Chapter IX, Section 11, P. 351). 
/LA(JMBi = ф, arc A0Bt = arc AiBi = In the new position E has been 
rotated from the zero-position by the angle ф = ф + (Я/г)ф; hence ф = 
(r/(R + г))ф. The coordinates of m are X = - (R + r)sin ф, Y = (R + r)cos</r. 
It follows from this that the motion is given by

Хг = (R + r)sin (рф/2),
Xy = 2sin (ф/2), 
X4 = 2cos(4>/2)
(13.3)
P = (R " r)/(R + r).
For variable values of ф these equations are a parametric representation of 
the image curve k. The same expressions hold if the moving circle is internally 
tangent to the fixed one, provided that we take r negative. We remark that p 
is always a finite number, since R 4- r = 0 would mean that the circles 
coincide. The center m of the moving circle describes the circle (M; R + r). 
Hence, as follows from Section 7, the image curve of a cycloidal motion is on a 
quadric of the set H. Indeed, (13.2) satisfies (7.3) which for this case becomes
(13.4) 
H«X? + XM(R + r)2(Xj+Xj) = 0.
We have supposed for the time being that R and r are finite numbers. There 
are two limiting cases: R » ® and r = In the first case a circle of radius r 
rolls on a straight line (“simple cycloidal motion”), in the second, the inverse 
of the first, a straight line rolls on a fixed circle of radius R.

The cycloidal motion is in general transcendental, for its image curve has in 
general infinitely many intersections with a plane. We obtain an algebraic 
motion if and only if, in (13.2), the number p is rational. The image curve is 
then an algebraic curve on H.
There are on H two systems of generators, Gi and G2. It is easily seen that 
an algebraic curve on H has the same number of intersections, s, say, with any 
line of G, (i = 1,2), the degree of the curve being st + s2.
The meaning of the generators for the E, S configuration has been 
investigated in Section 3. Let gb g2 be the generators through the image point 
of the zero-position. Then the points of gi correspond to the displacements of 
E for which m0 is the rotation center; those of g2 are the displacements with 
rotation center M (Example 22). Hence is the number of times, during the 
complete cycloidal motion, that m passes through its initial position m0; s2 is 
the number of times a position of E follows from the initial one by a rotation 
about M. Therefore, if |R |: |r | = q}: q2, q\ and q2 being positive, relatively 
prime integers, we have Sj = q2, s2 = qi. The image curve of an algebraic 
cycloidal motion is an algebraic curve on the hyperboloid H, of order qt + q2, 
intersecting the generators of one system q} times and those of the other system q2 
times.
Depending on the signs of R, r, R + r and R - r, different types of cycloidal 
motion may be considered.
If R = r we have p = 0 and in (13.2) X2 = 0; the image curve is a plane 
section of H, and consequently a conic; we recognize the quadratic motion 
dealt with in Section 6. The corresponding cycloidal motion appears if a circle 
rolls externally on a congruent circle. Obviously we have = q2 = 1.
The case R 4- r = 0 is not a possible one, because the two circles coincide. 
As seen from (13.4) H would be a pair of conjugate imaginary planes.
We may from now on suppose R - r and R + r to be unequal to zero, 
whence qy / q2.
Consider first the case R >0, r >0, R - r >0, and consequently qt > q2.

X4=P4(r),
in which Pb P2, P3, P4 stand for polynomials in t of degrees qx - q2, qx- q2- 1, 
qx + q2- 1 and qi + q2 respectively. We have obtained a rational parametric 
representation of k; the curve is indeed seen to be of order qx + q2. It passes 
through the points Kx = (0,0,1, - i) and K2 = (0,0,1, i), the tangent points of 
H and the planes V! and V2 respectively. Moreover any intersection of V, and 
к satisfies tan (л2т7/2) = i. the n2 roots of which are all t = i. The conclusion is 
that the qx 4- q2 common points of к and Vi coincide with Kj; KtJt has ф, and 
KJ2 has q2 points in common with k.
If qi and q2 have different parity, one being even and the other odd, n 1 and 
n2 are both odd. The argument must be modified somewhat but leads to the 
same result. The case R >0, r >0, R - r <0 may be treated along the same 
lines if we make use now of Л) = <7, - q2, n2 = q,+ q2, putting a minus sign 
before Xj.
Summarizing we have: if the centrodes of an algebraic cycloidal motion are 
externally tangent its image curve к is a rational (qx,q2)-curve on H, having 
ф + ф points in common with Vt (i = 1,2) all of which coincide at Kt.

the two planes and consider the motion of X with respect to E: the inverse

THE INVERSE MOTION

motion, as distinguished from the original, the direct motion. One motion 
determines the other one; the inverse of the inverse motion is the direct 
motion.
The formulas (1.2) define the image of the direct displacement. The inverse 
displacement has the same rotation center but the opposite rotation angle. 
Therefore, if 0(Х,, X2, X3, X4) is the image of the direct motion and 
Q(Xi,X2,X3,X4) that of its inverse we have
(14.1) 
X. = X», X2 = X2, X3 = Хз, X4 = - X4.
This is a transformation of the image space which may be called the reflection 
into the origin O. It is however not a 2'-displacement: the points Jb J2 are 
each invariant for (14.1) but the planes V, and V2 are interchanged. If к is the 
image curve of a motion, that of the inverse motion, denoted by k, follows 
from к by (14.1). This implies that the two motions have much in common; к 
and к are projectively equivalent. They have the same order, the same genus, 
the same number and types of special points, and so on. But we know that the 
properties of the motion depend not only on these characteristics, but also on 
the behavior of к with respect to Jb J2, Vb V2. It follows immediately from 
(14.1) that к and к have identical positions with respect to Л and J2, but the 
position of к with respect to Vj (V2) is the same as that of к with respect to V2 
(Vi). Consulting the fundamental Table (4.6) we see at once that if к is either 
of the types I, II or III, к will be of the same type. But this does not hold for 
types IV and V. First of all we have to split type IV into two sub-cases: the 
case IV', S = Jb S' = J2, r in Vb r*  in V2, and the case IV", covering all cases of 
IV different from IV'. Then we have obviously: if к is of type IV", к is of that 
same type, and inversely too. But if к is of type IV', к is of type V and if к is of 
type V, к is of type IV'.
Hence if к has m, intersections with I of type / (j = 2,3,5), m4 of type IV', 
m” of type IV", we have
my = (j = 2,3),
m I = m I, 
(142) 
m 4 —
m5 = mi,
and accordingly, in view of (4.7), we obtain the following formulas relating the 
order and the circularity of the paths of the direct and the inverse motion
(14.3) N = N + 2(m5- mi), c = c + 2(m5 - m i), d = d - 2(m5- m i);

Let Q(t) be the image curve к of a motion, t being a parameter. If Q2 is the 
point СФ + ДГ), the center of the rotation which transforms Oi into Q2 
approaches the instantaneous center (or centro, or first order pole) for the 
position Q, as Дг—>0. This implies that the fixed centrode of the motion is 
given by

THE CENTRODES
435
Making use of (15.2) the fixed centrode is given by
(15.5) 
X/ = pi4”'P23, Yf ~ piy — p42 Zf = рм,
*
and the moving centrode by
(15.6) 
= pH + р2л, y« = ~ P13- p42, Zm = pM,
where p„(r) are the Pliicker coordinates of the tangent to к at the point Q(t). 
If the tangent intersects the line 1 (pM = 0) the motion is instantaneously a 
translation and the centro is at infinity.
The centro would be undetermined if in (15.5) Xf » Yf = Zf =0. Hence 
pu = p», p»5 = p*2,  Pw = 0, which implies in view of the fundamental relation, 
рмр» + p^p42 + Р12Р34e 0, either
(15.7) 
Pl4=P23=l, 
P13=P42=i, Pm = 0,
or
(15.8) 
p,4 = P23 = 1, 
P13 = P42 = - i. Pm = 0,
both times with arbitrary pI2. The lines (15.7) are those of the pencil w, in V! 
with vertex J2; those of (15.8) are the conjugate imaginary lines w2 in V2 
through Jj.
The set of tangents of the image curve к constitute the tangent surface T of 
k; it is algebraic if к is algebraic. If T does not contain any line of wH w2 all 
tangents correspond to a well-determined centro. The order of the fixed 
centrode is equal to the number of solutions of a linear equation between the 
Xh Yf, Zf of (15.5); that is to say it is equal to the number of tangents of к 
intersecting a straight line. This number r, the rank of k, is also the order of T. 
If. however, for t = t0 the tangent р<;(/) belongs to the pencil w, or w2, the 
coordinates Xf, Yf, Zf of (15.5) have the factor (t - tn) which diminishes the 
order of the centrode by one. Similar arguments apply to the moving 
centrode. Summarizing we have: if r is the rank of the image curve к of a 
motion, and if tangents of к belong to the pencils (V,; J2) and to (V2; J,), s2 
tangents to (V,; J>) and to (V2;J2), the order of the fixed centrode is r -2$i; 
that of the moving centrode is r - 2s2.
Example 71. It is well-known that the rank of the intersection of two quadrics is equal to eight; 
determine the order of the centrodes of a general four-bar motion.
Example 72. Check the order of the centrodes of the elliptic motion and of its inverse motion. 
Example 73. Show that for the general rational motion of order n. the order of both centrodes is 
2л - 2. If the image of a symmetrical motion is a plane curve k, verify that the centrode’s order 
equals the class of k.
The fixed centrode (15.5) passes through h if pM = 0 and pn-p42 =

i (ры - pM). This implies that the line p„ either passes through Л or is lying in 
V|. Analogously, if it passes through /2, the tangent passes through J2 or is 
lying in V2. Similar conditions hold for the moving centrode.
Example 74. Determine the circularities of the centrodes of the general four-bar motion. 
Example 75. Check the circularities of the centrodes of the elliptic motion.
16. Instantaneous kinematics
A motion of the plane E with respect to 2 is represented by a curve к in the 
image space S'. A position of E corresponds to a point of k. Obviously the 
instantaneous properties of the position correspond to the local characteris­
tics of к at the point under consideration, such as the tangent, the osculating 
plane, the 2 '-curvature, and so on. In view of (2.7) the J'-arc-element of the 
curve к is d</>.
The image point of the displacement D(a, b; Ф) has been defined by (1.6),
X,: X2: X3: X4 =
(16 .1) = 
sin(f ф) - bcos(Jd>)): (a cos(J</>)+ b sin(l</>)): 2sin({<£): 2cos(j<b).
The image of the zero-position a = b = </>=0is the origin, О = (0,0,0,1). 
Furthermore, if we introduce canonical frames in E and 5, which implies 
a। = bi = a2 = 0, we obtain for the differential quotients, with respect to arc 
lengths s, of X, at the origin, up to the third order,
x; = o,
x; = o,
x;= i,
XI = 0,
(16.2) X',= -b2,
x; = o,
x; = o,
x:= -j,
xr = -
XT = a. + (3/2)b2,
X7= -1,
X7 = ().
Hence the use of canonical frames gives us the results that in the image space 
the tangent of к at О has the equations Xi = X2 = 0 and the osculating plane 
is X2 = 0.
To study higher order instantaneous properties we should develop the 
differential geometry of S' and introduce such notions as 2'-curvature and 
2'-torsion. We shall not do this, instead we restrict ourselves to some 
examples.
Up to the second order the curve к coincides with its osculating plane, 
which means that any motion is up to the second order a symmetrical motion. 
If the osculating plane is stationary the curve is a plane one up to the third 
order. The condition for this is X?X
*
 - X2X? = 0. From (16.2) this yields 
X7 = 0 or 2a3 4- 3b2 = 0, in accordance with Chapter VIII.

Example 76. Determine and derive the condition that the osculating plane has five 
consecutive points in common with k. Check that this is in accordance with the condition that the 
motion is instantaneously symmetrical to the fourth order (Chapter VIII).
This example illustrates the notion of two motions having instantaneously a 
contact of some order (which implies that all the paths of both motions have 
the corresponding order of contact at each point of the plane), the motions 
being identical up to a certain order. This is of importance if we want a given 
motion to be instantaneously compared with or approximated by a simpler 
motion. In our example the latter was a symmetrical motion.
We give a second example, asking whether a given motion is to a certain 
extent instantaneously identical with another simple motion, the elliptic 
motion. If the image curve of the latter passes through O, with the tangent 
Xi = X2 = 0 and the osculating plane X2 = 0, its equations are given in Section 
11, Example 53; with the arc length as parameter (i.e., t = tan (Ф/2)) they read
Xi = - R sin2(|</>)cos(l<£),
(16.3)
X2= R sin3(l<f>), 
x3 = sinG<n 
X4 = cos(?<f>).
which implies for ф = 0:
X, = 0, 
X2 = 0, 
Xy = 0,
x; = o, 
x;=o, 
x;=j,
(16-4) 
x,,= _!R x- = 0

X4 = 1,
XI = 0,
X" = — J 
4 
4,
Xn; = 0, X7 = (3/4)R, Xmy = - (1/8), x? = 0.
If we compare (16.2) and (16.4) we see that the ratios of the coordinates are 
identical up to the second order provided R = b2, which means that any 
motion is up to that order identical with one well-defined elliptic motion. 
Furthermore the third derivatives are only the same if ay = b3 = 0, which are 
therefore the conditions for a Cardan position of the moving plane; this is in 
accordance with Chapter VIII.

of freedom, denoted by M2, corresponds to the study of surfaces in the 
X '-geometry.
Example 77. Consider an M. corresponding (o a plane in the image space. Prove that any M, 
belonging to M. is a symmetric motion.
Important examples are those for which a given point A of the moving 
plane E is compelled to stay on a given curve p of 2. In Section 10 we 
considered the case of p being a circle or a straight line.
If p is an arbitrary curve of J, Ao the position of A on p at the 
zero-posit ion, Af any other position of A on p, then all displacements 
Ao—► A । belong to the set and therefore the images of these displacements lie 
on the image surface F. But we know that the locus of these images is a 
straight line. Hence F is a ruled surface. Furthermore: the lines corresponding 
to the displacements An—* A( and Ao—♦ A2 are 2'-parallel (Example 18). This 
implies that the generators of F are mutually 1 '-parallel, they intersect the 
same lines of the isotropic pencils m, and m2, through in V2 and J2 in Va 
respectively. The conclusion is: F is a ruled surface with two directrices.
Let p be an algebraic curve of order N and suppose that it is not circular. Its 
equation is P[X, У, Z] = 0. If we let A be the point (x, y, z) of E, in view of 
(1.9) the equation of the image surface F under consideration reads
P[(Xi- X2)x - 2X,X4y + 2(X,X,+ X2X4)z,2X3X4x 4- (X24- X\)y
(171> + 2(ХгХ, - X,X.)z, (X? + xi)z ] = o,
which implies that F is of order 2N. If we substitute X3 = AX4 in (17.1) the left- 
hand-side has the factor X? and the conclusion is: I is an N-fold line on F.
If p is of order N and c-circular its equation is
(X2 + У2)‘RN.2t (X, У) + (X2 + У2)еZRn.Uu (X, У) + • • • +
(17,2) 
+(X’+ Y2)Z‘ 
Y)+Z'Rn..(X, Y,Z) = 0,
in which R„ stands for a polynomial of degree u.
Without any loss of generality we may suppose that A is the origin in E. 
Then (1.9) simplifies to
(17.3) 
X = 2(Х,Хз+Х2Х4), У = 2(Х2Хэ- X|X4), Z = X?+Xj, 
which implies
(17.4) 
X2 + У2 = 4(Xf + XJ)(X? 4- XJ).
If we substitute (17.3) into (17.2) the left-hand-side has the factor (X2 + X^)

and the locus proper of order 2N -2c, the line 1 being (N - 2c)-fold on it. 
Combining the foregoing, our result is: the displacements of E such that a 
given point of E is compelled to remain on a curve p of X, of order N and 
circularity c, correspond to a ruled surface F of order 2N - 2c, of which 1 is a 
(N - 2c)-fold generator; F has two directrices m, and m2, both (N - c)-fold 
lines, mi in V, through J2t m2 in V2 through J,.
Through any point of m( or m2 pass (N-c) generators of F. The 
intersection of F and V! consists of the (N - enfold line mb the (N - 2c)-fold 
generator J, and c generators through J,.
Example 78. Analytically verify the nature of the intersection of F and V„ by means of (17.2), 
(17.3) and (17.4).
Example 79. Check the result if p is a straight line (N ® 1, c ■ 0).
Example 80. Check the result if p is a circle (N = 2, c  1).
*
We investigate the case where p is an ellipse with semi-axes a and b (a / b). 
For a suitable chosen frame (Fig. 91) its equation is b2X2 -2ab2XZ 4- a2 Y2 = 
0. Hence the image surface F is
b2(X,X, + X2X4)2 + a2(X2X, - X,X4)2
(17‘5) 
- ab2(X,X} + X2X4)(X1 + XJ) = 0.
F is a quartic ruled surface with three double lines: the line 1 and the 
directrices mb m2.
The ellipse can be represented by

In the zero-position A is at Ao. All rotation centers for displacements Ao —* A

and since A0M = (a2 4- b2r2),z2(l + t2)-1 and MP = XA0M we have tan(}<£) =

two parameters t and A; F is a rational surface. A constant value of t 
corresponds to a generator.

Example 82. Investigate the image surface of those displacements for which a point of E 
remains on a parabola or on a hyperbola of £.
So far we have considered certain sets M2 and determined their image 
surfaces F in 2'. We now make some remarks about the opposite mapping: 
given a surface F in 2' we ask for the corresponding set M2 of positions of E 
with respect to S.
Let F be an algebraic surface of order л. We know that the set of 
displacements for which a point A of E moves from its zero-position Ao to 
the point A of 2 is mapped on a line p(A0A) of X'. This line has in general л 
points in common with F. Hence the theorem: the surface F in of order л, 
corresponds to a M> with the property that any point of E coincides n times 
with any point of 2. But this is of course only true if we also accept imaginary 
positions, since the intersections of p(A0A) and F need not be real. If л is 
odd, however, at least one intersection is real, and we may conclude: the M; 
corresponding to a surface F of odd order has the property that the positions 
of any point A of E fill the complete 2, that is to say, A is able to move to any

point of 1. If on the other hand all intersections of p(A0A) and F are 
imaginary the position A is inaccessible to Ao. which is therefore compelled 
to remain within a certain region of J.
Example 83. 
Consider the case when F is a plane and therefore n - 1.
The lines p(AnA) for a fixed Ao and variable A constitute a linear line 
congruence L(A0), built up of all lines intersecting two conjugate lines of the 
pencils mi and m2 in V| and V2 respectively. Hence the position of F with 
respect to the lines of L(A0) determines topologically the domain of Ao; J 
will be divided in a finite number of regions Gu,Gi,... ,Gn, such that Ao 
passes 5 times through any point of G,; some regions may be empty. Ao is on 
a borderline of a region in those positions of E which correspond to points on 
F where the line L(A0) through it is a tangent of F. We note that the regions 
depend on Ao; their number and their shape may be different for different 
points Ao.
Example 84. The image surface of an M2 is the cone X  + X’- Л’Х  = 0. Determine the 
accessible region of the origin О and of an arbitrary point of E.
*

Example 85. 
The image surface is the hyperboloid XtX2 - \ 3XyX4. Determine the accessible 
region of any point of E. If Che region is not the complete plane X, show that it is bordered by a 
bicircular quartic curve.
Example 86. 
Determine the characteristic property of an M2, the image surface of which is a 
ruled surface. Apply this to the two preceding examples.
Example 87. 
Determine the characteristic property of an M2, the image surface of which is a 
ruled surface with generators belonging to a linear congruence ЦАО). Show that the accessible 
“region” of Ao is a curve.
Instantaneous properties of an M; could be studied by means of our 
mapping. We would need, however, the differential-geometrical theory of 
surfaces in ^'-geometry, which will not be developed here. We remark only 
that, up to the first order, F may be replaced by its tangent plane al the origin. 
From this follows immediately the well-known theorem: the locus of the 
instantaneous centers of the Mi's belonging to M2 is a straight line (Chapter X, 
Section 6).
18. Algebraic motion with two given paths
If two points of E describe algebraic paths, the image curve of the motion 
of E is the intersection of two algebraic surfaces and therefore algebraic; this 
implies that the path of any point is algebraic.
Example 88. 
Show that if one path is transcendental, there is at most one algebraic path.

If the points Ai, A2 of E are compelled to remain on the curves pIf p? of 2 
respectively, the motion of E is completely defined. In the J'-space this 
corresponds to the intersection к of the surfaces F>, F2, as investigated in 
Section 17. It is of course possible that к has no real points: then the motion is 
impossible. The condition, necessary and sufficient, to obtain a real motion is 
obviously dm< A|A2< dm (d™) being the minimum (maximum) distance 
between a point of pt and one of p2.
Let p, be a c,-circular curve of order N, (i - 1,2). Then the motion thus 
defined has as its image curve к the intersection of two image surfaces F, 
(i = 1,2) which are ruled surfaces of order 2N, - 2c„ with 1 as a (N, - 2c.У 
fold generator. The intersection degenerates into the line 1, counted 
(Ni - 2Ci)(N2 - 2c2) times. This implies that the order of the proper intersec­
tion к is
n = (2/V. - 2c.)(2/V2 - 2c2)- (/V, - 2c,)(N, - 2c2)
(181)
= 3NlN2-2Nlc2-2N2cl.
Example 89. Show that Jt and J3 arc |(N> - c.)(N3 - c2)]-fold points of k.
We know that not only the order of к is of importance but also its position 
with respect to J., Л, V., V2. The intersection of V. and F, consists of the 
directrix in V. (a(N, - c,)-fold line of F.) and q lines through J,. Hence к has 
Ci(N2~ c2)+ c2(Ni - c.) points in Vb not on I; furthermore in view of the 
multiplicity of J., J2> on k, and of the order of k, we determine the 
characteristic numbers of к in Table (4.6) to be
(18.2) гл2 = т1 = 0, m4=CiC2, m5 = N.N2 - /V.c2- N2ct.
From (4.7), (18.1) and (18.2) it follows that (for the order N and the circularity 
c of the path of an arbitrary point of E)
(18.3)
/V = 2N|N2 - 2ciC2, c = /V,c2 4- N2Ci - CjC2;
these are the formulas of S. Roberts which we derived in Chapter IX.
19. The mapping of indirect displacements
Besides displacements D we have considered (in Chapter I, Section 7) 
orthogonal transformations D' of a plane, called indirect displacements (or 
symmetries), which change its orientation to the opposite one. They inter­
change the isotropic points h. I2. The general expression for a D'(a, 6, ф) is:

(19.1) X = - x cos<J> - у sin ф 4-a, Y = - x sin Ф 4- у cosф 4- b.
We can easily show that (19.1) has an invariant line s, its axis, given by the 
equation
(19.2) 
x со$({ф) + у sin({<£)-{(a cos({<£)+ b sin(J2<^))z = 0,
and that it may be considered as the product (in any order) of the reflection 
into s and the translation in the direction of s, with distance
(19.3)
d = l(- a sin(2</>)+ b cos(|<£)).
We shall represent the indirect displacement D'(a,b, Ф) (19.1) by a plane in 
the image space £', with the equation UiXt + U2X2 + UyXy + L74X4 = 0, the 
coefficients Ut being given by
(19.4)
Ui = 2cos($<J>),
LG = 2sin(l
*),
Uy = - (a cos (I ф) 4- b sin (J ф)), 
U4 = - a sin(зф) + b cos(l</>).
To answer the question whether any plane is the image of an indirect 
displacement we determine a, b, ф from (19.4), if the U, are given. After 
some algebra we obtain for the indirect displacement, in homogeneous 
coordinates:
X = - (U2t - U22)x - 2U> U2y - 2( 1Л U3 4- U2 U4)zy 
(19.5) Y= -2(Л(Лх+(и?- U2)y +2(UtU<- U2Uy)z, 
Z = (U]+U22)z, 
from which it follows that any plane U with U\ 4- corresponds to an 
indirect displacement. Moreover if U]+U22 = ®, without 1Л = 0, U2 = 0, 
formula (19.5) represents a singular transformation: if Ut - iU2 all points go 
to /2, if (Ji = - iU2 they are transformed to h. If, however, Ui = U2 = 0, the 
transformation is meaningless. Hence: the only planes not corresponding to 
an indirect displacement are the planes through I; planes through or J2, but 
not through both, correspond to singular symmetries; all other planes 
correspond to non-singular symmetries.
Special symmetries are the reflections, characterized by d = 0. Hence 
reflections correspond to planes for which U4 = 0, they are the planes through 
the origin. There is obviously a strong similarity between the image points of

D'(a, b. ф), as is seen by comparing (1.6) and (19.4). Excluded for the former 
are points on 1, while for the latter we exclude planes through 1. Singular 
displacements correspond to points of the planes VH V3, singular indirect 
displacements to planes through J,, J2. Special displacements, half turns, 
correspond to points of a plane (X4 = 0); special indirect displacements, 
reflections, to planes through a point ((J4 = 0).

axes of D; and D;. Check whether the converse theorem is true. Show that D is a translation if and 
only if the axes of D! and D', arc parallel. Show that D is a half turn if and only if the axes are 
perpendicular.
Let X be the image point of a displacement D which gives E the position 
Ei, and U the image plane of an indirect displacement D' transforming E into 
the position E2. Then E} is transformed into E2 by D'D’1 which is an indirect 
displacement, with the image plane U' say. D~‘ follows from (1.9), and D' is 
given by (19.5). Multiplying the respective transformation matrices we obtain

Ui = - l/,X3 + U2X> + UyX4 - ux3,

LT is a reflection if (71 = 0. Hence the theorem: if the image point of the 
displacement D lies in the image plane of the indirect displacement D’, the two 
corresponding positions of E are transformed one into the other by a reflection, 
and the converse is also true.
This gives us a new interpretation of a plane in the image space, considered 
as the locus of its points: it corresponds to the set of motions which yield 
positions of E generated as if a fixed, symmetrical (i.e., indirect) position of E 
is reflected in all lines of

CHAPTER XI!
KINEMATICS IN OTHER GEOMETRIES
1. Introduction
Until now we have mainly studied kinematics in two and three-dimensional 
Euclidean spaces. In this chapter we treat the kinematics associated with 
geometries of a different structure. According to the well-known Klein 
principle, a geometry may be defined as the study of the invariants of a group 
of transformations. Extending this concept to kinematics we define a transfor­
mation of the group as a displacement in the geometry under consideration; a 
continuous set of transformations which depend on one or more parameters is 
called a motion. Concepts such as trajectories and instantaneous kinematics 
have, in the new geometries, a meaning analogous to those of the classic 
theory. In this chapter we consider: kinematics in n-dimensional Euclidean 
geometry, in particular the cases n = 4, and n = 5; the kinematics of equiform 
geometry, an extension of the ordinary theory because it accepts also 
similarity transformations; the kinematics of two types of non-Euclidean 
geometry; the kinematics of affine geometry, and some other examples.
In all these cases we try to follow the main themes of this book: finite 
positions theory, instantaneous kinematics (with emphasis on canonical 
frames and instantaneous invariants), and special motions. We have confined 
ourselves to a concise treatment of all examples and restricted ourselves to 
the most important features, the choice of subjects being determined primar­
ily by the attractiveness of the kinematics concerned, the simplicity (or 
complexity) of the matter, and the present state of knowledge. Some topics 
that are almost completely omitted are the motions of lines and planes, the 
inverse motion, and motions with more than one parameter.
A survey of kinematica) theory in various geometries has been given by 
H. R. Muller [1970J along with an extensive list of references.

2. Kinematics in n- dimensional Euclidean space
We know from Chapter I that Euclidean n-dimensional spaces exhibit 
different behavior, as far as kinematical properties are concerned, depending 
upon if n is either an even or an odd number. As an example of both 
possibilities we now consider the cases n = 4 and n = 5.
A (one-parameter) motion in four-dimensional Euclidean space is analyti­
cally represented by 
(2.1)
P = Ap + d.
P and p being the position vectors (or their column matrices) of a point in the 
fixed and the moving spaces £ and E respectively; A is an orthogonal 
4 x 4-matrix and d is the position vector of the origin of the moving system. 
Both A and d depend on the parameter t. Introducing notations which are 
somewhat different from those in the preceding chapters we denote the 
Cartesian coordinates of the points P and p by X», X2, X3, X4 and xb x2, x5, x*  
respectively. For any function f(r) we denote df/dr by f and its value at t = 0 
by Г.
We know from Chapter I, Section 4 that a displacement in E4 has in genera! 
one invariant point and moreover two mutually orthogonal invariant planes 
through it. Hence for the instantaneous case there is one point with velocity 
zero, the pole, which we take as the origin О of the canonical frames. 
Moreover there are two orthogonal planes through О and they rotate about 
О with a certain angular velocity. We take these planes to be x3 = x4 = 0 and 
x> = x2 = 0 respectively. It follows from this that the first order derivates for a 
moving point in the zero position are expressed by
X 1 — ~ Cl>|X2,
XJ = wiXi,
(2.2)
x; - - <^:X4,
X4 — co2x3,
and o>2 being the two angular velocities; we exclude the singular cases 
o)i<o2 = 0. (Note that the axes Ox„ OXa in the one invariant plane and OX1, 
in the other are not yet determined.) If we consider time-dependent proper­
ties (2.2) contains two instantaneous invariants <u(, w2; there is one geometric 
invariant: the ratio <ot: a>2. (2.2) gives the velocity vector of any point A (x,); it 
is perpendicular to the radius vector OA.
Example 1. Show that all points on a line О A have parallel velocity vectors.

Example 2. Show that the plane through OA and the path tangents of its points is given, for 
instance, by the two equations

Example 3. Show that the set of x4 path tangents is built up of x' plane parallel pencils, one 
through every point at infinity.
Example 4. If Ut (i = 1.......5) are 3-space coordinates show that the normal-space of the path is
given by
Ut - — <M|X}, 
—cUiXt, Uy - - <u.x4, I74 = w2x,, Uy~0;
it passes through О and it is the same for all points on OA. Any 3-space through О is the normal 
space of all points on a line through О (perpendicular to the 3-space).
Example 5. Consider in (2.2) the special case a»t = 0, <u2X 0 and prove that every point of the 
plane хл = x4 = 0 is a pole.
Example 6. A linear transformation for n + 1 homogeneous coordinates has in general n + 1 
invariant points. Verify that, for the “infinitesimal transformation” (2.2) with n + 1 » 5. these 
points are the origin and the isotropic points of the invariant planes x, = x4 - 0 and x, = x2 = 0.
Example 7. Derive the first order expressions, analogous to (2.2). for 2m -dimensional Euclidean 
kinematics; show that they contain m time-dependent and m - 1 geometrical invariants. 
Determine the 2m + 1 invariant points.
Let the frames in the moving and the fixed space coincide in the 
zero-position, but be otherwise arbitrary. Then from (2.1) it follows that
x; = W12X2 •+• touXj +

where o>., = - o>/4, and a I are the components of d'. These expressions give the 
velocity vector of a point in terms of its coordinates in the fixed space.
The pole is found from (2.3) using the conditions X', - 0 (1 = 1,2,3.4); this 
gives us four linear equations for its coordinates. The determinant D of the 
set is D = (o)l4o)23 + й>24й)з| 4- a)Ma)|2)2. If D = 0 the system has either no (finite)

To study second order properties we make use of formulas (2.5), (2.7) of 
Chapter П. For our case elements of the matrix Bt are given by the coefficients 
in (2.2); this implies that C2 is a diagonal matrix with the terms — ai], — 
- u)2. The components of the position vector d (i.e., 
a2, a^. a4) in
(2.1) are zero for t =0 and also satisfy a' = 0 if we choose the origin of 
coordinates at the pole. We obtain for the velocity components X(, up to the 
first order
X| = - tofxi + (“W| + tE i2)x2 + tej4x4 + alt.

where e4 = - e„ are the elements of the skew matrix B2. If we solve X = 0 
(i = 1,2,3,4) for x,, restricting ourselves to first order terms, we get
(2.6) 
x»=—fal/iUi, x2 = tal/a>i. xy--tal/^2. x4= tal/ш 2.
which gives, to the first order, the position of the pole in the moving space, or, 
in other words, the pole velocity for the zero-position. Our coordinate system 
is not completely determined, because the x, and x2 axes are as yet arbitrary 
in their plane, and the same holds for the x, and x4 axes. Therefore, we fix the 
frame with the condition that the projections of the polar velocity on the 
invariant planes are directed along the x»- and the xraxis respectively (or in 
other words that the polar velocity vector is in the plane x2 = x4 = 0). This 
implies al - a" = 0. The canonical system is now completely defined, and we 
obtain from (2.5) the second order relations

could be asked about second order instantaneous properties of the motion. It 
contains the first order invariants wj, a>2 and moreover the eight second order 
invariants consisting of the six e„ as well as a 1 and al. All these are 
time-dependent. Obviously (2.7) gives us the acceleration vector of any point 
of the moving space. Solving XI - 0 (i = 1,2,3,4) for x, we conclude that

there exists in general one point in the moving space whose acceleration is 
equal to zero: the acceleration pole.
The polar velocity vector for the canonical systems reads ( —аЗ/шьО, 
— aZ/a>3,0); it is time-dependent.
The curvature theory of the paths is contained in the sets (2.2) and (2.7). We 
shall not fully develop it. Here we restrict ourselves to determining the locus 
of the points which in the zero-position are at an inflection of their paths. 
These points satisfy the equations X”, = AXI, which are four linear equations 
for xk (k = 1,2,3,4) all containing the linear parameter A. If we introduce 
homogeneous coordinates x,, x2, x4 x4, x5 and then soive for the x,, we see 
that x, and x> are cubic polynomials in Л, x2 and x4 are quadratic and x5 is a 
quartic polynomial. Hence the inflection curve is a rational quartic curve (a 
so-called norm curve) in the moving space. It passes through the origin (when 
A = which must be excluded from the locus) and through the acceleration 
pole (when A = 0). It is the analog of the inflection circle in planar kinematics.
Example 8. Prove that the tangent of the inflection curve at О coincides with the pole-velocity 
vector.
We could also have obtained (2.7) using the method considered in Chapter 
II, Section 3: Restricting ourselves to the rotational part of the motion (given 
in arbitrary frames), differentiating with respect to /, and then eliminating x, 
we obtain
X, = <О|’Хз+ 
ai|4X4,
and so forth by cyclic substitution.
Differentiating once more and eliminating X, yields

Then introducing the canonical frames we can substitute X, » x„ oi|2 = -

What was done here for first and second order instantaneous kinematics in 
four-dimensional space may easily be expanded to 2m -dimensional space. 
There is in general one pole and moreover there are m invariant planes 
through it. The generalization of (2.2) contains m invariants and that of 
(2.7) an additional m(2m - 1) invariants eti = and also m invariants from 
the part of the motion described by the displacement vector d.
Example 9. Consider the foregoing for the case m = 1, i.e., when we are dealing with planar 
kinematics.
Example 10. Show that the inflection curve in 2m -dimensional kinematics is a rational 2m-ic. 
passing through the pole and through the acceleration pole.
Example 11. Express the pole velocity vector in terms of the instantaneous invariants for a 
2m -dimensional space.
Kinematics in (2m + l)-dimensional space is less elegant and more difficult 
to handle than in 2m -dimensional space. Because the determinant of a skew 
(2m 4-1) x (2m 4-1) matrix is always zero it follows that there is in general no 
(finite) pole. There is, however, a real invariant point at infinity, which gives 
rise to a screw-axis I; every point of 1 has its velocity in the direction of 1. Any 
2m-space, orthogonal to 1, is translated (instantaneously, to the first order) as 
a whole in this same direction, and within such a space the rules of 
2m-dimensional kinematics are valid up to the first order. So, for m = 2, for 
instance, if we take X5 parallel to I, first-order properties are expressed by 
virtue of (2.2) as
(2.10) X। ~ 
X2 = Ш|Х|, X i “ W2X4, X4 e 
X5 
v,
with three time-dependent invariants v. The origin of the canonical 
frame is not yet determined. This may be done using second-order considera­
tions just as we did for the 3-space, i.e., we make use of the striction point 
concept; we remark that two neighboring screw axes always lie in a 3-space, 
and have therefore a common perpendicular. Having established the basic 
concepts we stop here leaving any detailed development to the reader.
Special continuous motions in n-dimensional space E" can be defined by 
imposing (к - 1) simple conditions on the general displacement, where к = 
}л(и + 1) is the degree-of-freedom of a free moving E". Another, analytical, 
technique is to express the general displacement in terms of к parameters: 
ln(n - 1) of them for the rotational part (as given by Cayley’s representation 
of an orthogonal matrix) and n for the motion of the origin. (If the origin is 
taken on I these n are the so-called translation terms.) A motion is defined if 
all parameters are specified as functions of a parameter t.
Most often it is convenient to use a homogeneous set of parameters in

The rotational part of the motion may be given in terms of an orthogonal- 
matrix ||л«у || which is derived from C by the following formulas
(2.12) aa =(2coG/N)-l, 
=(2c0CJN) (<//)
where C4 is the minor of the у ш element of the matrix C. It may be shown that 
(nearly) all orthogonal matrices can be found by this procedure; (there are 
some exceptional ones which are limit cases of (2.12)). The elements of || 
depend on six parameters: the ratios of c0, c,„ which may be normalized by, 
say, the condition N = 1.
We find from (2.12):
N a 11 — c J + с 5(c и 4- c 34 + c « c >2 ~ c 13 ” c 14) Д2,
N al2 = 2co[c ku - Со(с15с2з + 
4- С34Д], etc.
The elements of || a,, || are quartic functions of the parameters; hence if we take 
each parameter to be a linear function of t, and the four coordinates for the 
moving origin to be functions of t of degree four (at most) multiplied by N~\ 
we have defined a special motion in 4-space for which all paths are (rational) 
quartic curves. This may be considered as an analog of the Cardan motion in 
the plane.
Cayley’s procedure is valid for arbitrary n. In order to derive an orthogonal 
matrix in n-space we must start from an n x и-matrix C similar to (2.11). If n 
is even the elements of at/ given by (2.12) are functions of degree n of the 
parameters c0, cif; if n is odd, N has the factor c0 and the a,, are thus of degree 
n -1.

In 5-space the elements of an orthogonal matrix are quartic functions of the 
(eleven) homogeneous parameters c0, clf. If they are all chosen as linear 
functions of t and the translation components are taken as functions of degree 
four (at most), we have defined in 5-space a motion for which all paths are 
quartic curves. A quartic curve, however, always lies in (at most) a 4-space. 
The motion is therefore an analog of the Darboux motion in 3-space.
Some remarks will now be made about 2- and 3-parameter motions in 
four-dimensional space. An M2 is represented by
(2.14) 
P = A(ru2)p+ <f(t„f2)
where h and t2 are the parameters. An M, belonging to (2.14) is defined if r( 
and t2 are given as (arbitrarily chosen) functions of t. We take the zero- 
position at ti = t2 = t = 0. From (2.14) we have
(2.15) 
P' = ((ЭА/ЭГ,)А. + (3A/3f2)A2)p 4- (d<f/ЭГ,)А, 4- (dd/dt2)A2,
with A, = rj (i = 1,2). If we write (2.15) in terms of the coordinates and if we 
eliminate x, we obtain in view of (2.3):
(2.16) 
Xi = ct)t2X24-Ю|ЧХЭ+Ш14Х4+al, and so forth in a cyclic 
Here = r0At 4- $VA2, a' = r,At 4- s,A2, where r0, s,h rt and s, follow from the 
given M2, while Ab A2 depend on the M, we have chosen. The pole of this M, 
follows from the equations XI = 0; because these are homogeneous linear 
expressions in terms of A, and A2, the pole depends only on the ratio A,: A2. 
Hence, there is at any moment a locus of <»' poles for an M2. The system of 
four equations for two homogeneous parameters A,, A2 has a rank which is at 
most two. This implies that in the zero-position all poles are in one plane. 
Their coordinates follow from (2.4) and are therefore homogeneous quadratic 
functions of A1, A2. The conclusion is: the locus of the poles of a 2-parameter 
motion in four-dimensional space, at a certain moment, is a conic.
For a 3-parameter motion M5 we have a similar property. In (2.16) we 
would have and a\ given as homogeneous linear functions of three 
parameters. Since the rank of the equations for X! = 0 would be at most 
three, it follows that all instantaneous poles lie in a 3-space. Moreover, their 
coordinates are quadratic functions of three homogeneous parameters: hence 
the locus of the poles at each moment is a Steiner surface.
Example 14. Show that the conics on this surface correspond to the loci of the poles of the 
M/s belonging to the M,.
Example 15. Show that the instantaneous locus of the poles of an M« is a three-dimensional 
manifold; the coordinates of its points are quadric functions of four homogeneous parameters.

3. Eq inform kinematics
A displacement in Euclidean space is a transformation which leaves the 
distance between any pair of points invariant; we deal now with transforma­
tions such that every distance is multiplied by the same number, called the 
scale factor, denoted by s. The displaced configuration is similar but not 
congruent to the original. The kinematics corresponding to such transforma­
tions will be called equiform.
In three-dimensional space an equiform displacement is represented by
(3.1) 
P = sAp+d;
for s = 1 we have congruent configurations, for s = 0 the transformation is 
singular; if s >0 the transformed configuration is directly similar with the 
original, for s < 0 they are symmetrically similar. It is a matter of convention 
whether to accept or to reject the case s < 0.
For a displacement we have now seven degrees of freedom; to the classical 
six we add the parameter s. For Cartesian frames the displacement is given by
X = s(aux + a,2y + a„z) + a,
(3.2)
Y = s(a2iX + a22y + a»z) + h.
Z = s(anx + a32y + aMz) + c.
where ||a.J| is an orthogonal matrix. If we introduce homogeneous coordi­
nates we see that the transformation for points in the plane at infinity is 
independent of s. Hence there are in general three invariant points in this 
plane, one real point A, and the two isotropic points in the plane orthogonal 
to the direction of Ah For a possible finite invariant point we must solve the 
equations X = x, У = у, Z = z which gives us three linear equations with the 
determinant

We know however (Chapter I, Section 4) that an orthogonal matrix in three

Hence, unless 5-, = s = 1, we have Д / 0. This implies that an equiform 
displacement has in general one finite invariant point Ao. If we take Ao as 
origin and A0At as o„ the displacement equations (3.2) take on the standard

This shows that the displacement may built up by a rotation about the axis Oz, 
followed by a dilation (or a homothety) with center О and scale factor s.
The fact that an equiform displacement has an invariant point was already 
known to Chasles (1831). It makes equiform kinematics in many respects 
easier to handle than classical three-dimensional kinematics, which appears as 
the singular case where Ao coincides with Ai and their join becomes, in the 
limit, the screw-axis. On the other hand it should be kept in mind that 
equiform geometry does not deal directly with distance and length; two points 
have no invariant, any pair of points may be displaced into any other pair; 
three points, however, have (two) invariants: the angles of their triangle or the 
ratios of their mutual distances. A general linear transformation of four 
homogeneous variables has in general four different invariant points; 
equiform displacements belong to this general class, ordinary displacements 
do not.
A motion in equiform geometry is defined if the parameters of (3.2), 
including 5, are given as functions of t. We remark that an actual angular 
velocity exists and so does the line along which the velocity vector of a point is 
directed, but the scalar value of this velocity is not defined.
We consider the instantaneous kinematics of equiform three-dimensional 
geometry. If we differentiate the expressions (3.2) with respect to t and 
eliminate x, y, z we obtain (provided aQ= b0 = co = 0; i.e., at t = 0 the origins 
of the coordinate frames coincide):

position), and if df/dt for t = 0 is denoted by fb we have

geometric invariant. (Note that s is a dimensionless number.)

where e4 are the values of a>, for t = 0. Ox and Oy are still arbitrary'. We 
choose them in such a way that the point coinciding with the pole moves, to 
the second order, in the Oxz-plane. Hence b2 = 0, and the canonical system is 
completely determined. The formulas (3.8) and (3.13) (the latter with b2 = 0) 
characterize the motion of any point up to the second order. The set contains 
the instantaneous invariants w, slt e,, e2, ел, s2, a2y c2.
Example 18. Determine (from (3.12)) the direction of the pole-tangent in the canonical frame. 
Example 19. Show that there is at any moment, in general, one point with zero-acceleration.
Example 20. Prove that the locus of the points which are at an inflection point of their path is a 
twisted cubic curve, passing through the pole and through the acceleration pole.
Example 21. In order to make b2 vanish in (3.13) the frame must be rotated about Oz through 
the angle 6. Determine в; show that s2, s,t a>, c2 do not change; determine the new values of 
a2y e„ e2.
From (3.13) we may derive the osculating plane of the path, the curvature 
axis as the intersection of two consective normal planes, and the center of 
curvature. Obviously the concept of radius of curvature does not exist in a 
geometry which does not deal with length.
It seems that not much attention has been given in the literature to spatial 
equiform kinematics. The plane case, however, has been developed at length, 
mainly be R. Muller [1910a, b, c] and by Krause (1910, 1920J. It will be 
treated here using, for the instantaneous case, methods adopted in former 
chapters.
An equiform displacement in the plane is represented by
(3.14) 
X = 5(x cos</> ~ у sin </>)4 a, Y = s(x sin ф 4 у cos ф) 4 b.
Example 22. Show that the displacement has in general one finite invariant point and determine 
its standard equations.
A motion is defined if in (3.14) one gives ф, a, b, s as functions of t. If we 
restrict ourselves to geometrical properties, the angle Ф can be taken as the 
independent variable. Then it follows from (3.14)

which for variable Ф represents the moving centrode. The centrode in the

($2 4- s2)Yp = s(sd - sb) 4- (s2 4- s2)b.
We shall deal now with finitely separated positions of a plane E with 
respect to a coinciding fixed plane X. If we have two positions and the frames 
are chosen to be coinciding in the first, then the second is defined by
(3.18) X = s(x cos ф - у sin ф)4- a, Y = s(x sin ф 4- у cos ф) + b.
It is easily seen that there, in general, is one finite invariant point,
X = x = [ - s(b sin ф 4- а со$ф)4- a]/N,
(3.19) У = у = [s(a sin ф - b cos ф) 4- b]/N,
N = (s cos ф - I)2 4- s2 sin2 ф.
the only exception occurs if Ф = 0, s = 1 which would mean we have a 
Euclidean translation. If we take the invariant point as the common origin we 
obtain
(3.20) X = s(x cos ф - у sin ф), Y = s(x sin ф 4- у cos ф).
For ф = 0, s/ 1 we have a dilation with scale factor s and center O. Any line 
through О is an invariant line. When ф/O, we find that there is no (real) 
finite invariant line.
We consider now three positions of E with respect to £. The displacement 
from position i to position j will be a rotation with center P4 and angle ф0, 
and a dilation with this same center and the scale factor As the product of 
displacements 1 —*2,  2—> 3, 3—► 1 is unity we have

We denote the ratios, of the lengths of a line segment in the three positions,

Example 23. Show that two positions of plane E with respect to plane 1 arc given by four pieces 
of data, and that three positions are given by eight data. Show that this last number is in 
accordance with specifying the positions by giving the four points P&, P„, Pl3 and P* a.
Consider the first position Et of E (Fig. 92). It has three special points: PUt 
РЭ1 and the point PL which is transformed into P23 by the displacement D|2 
and by Du as well. From this it follows that P12PL = a2ki/k2, P>iPL = aykjky, 
where a, (i = 1,2,3) are the sides of the pole triangle P12P23P31. Hence if the 
pole triangle is given and also the point PL, the three positions E, are known.

Hence the triangles P^PuP» and PjiP^PJi are similar. This implies that the 
first triangle may be transformed into the other by a rotation through angle 
y\ about center P12, followed by a dilation. Since the latter does not change 
the direction of any line we conclude that £PnHP3t is equal to y' and hence 
Z.P31HP23 = 7Г - y'. The point H has therefore the property that, from the 
viewpoint H, the sides of the pole triangle appear under the angles it - a\ 
tt - P' and я*  - y' respectively. This implies that the four points H, Pl2, Pk 
PM are on a circle, and analogously H, P2J, Pjt, Pn and Hy PJb P]2, P23, are on 
circles. An important conclusion is the following: three positions of a plane E 
with respect to 1 in equiform kinematics are completely determined by the 
pole triangle P23P.mPi2 and the point H. Indeed: C, are the circles through H 
and two vertices, Pjj is the intersection of P23H and C>, etc.

АЛАч all three similar to a given second triangle BtB2Bx. Then А,А1, 
A2AJ, A.vA'i pass through a point M, called the meta-pole of А)А2АЛ with 
respect to BtB2B^ it is also the common point of the circumcircles of the 
three associated triangles (Johnson [I960]).
Example 25. In Fig. 94 we have a + a' < ir, 0 + 0' < тг. у + у*  < ir. Consider the case when 
these inequalities are not all satisfied, which implies that H is outside the polar triangle or on its 
perimeter.
For arbitrary frames, the three positions (X„ Y.) in 5 of the point (x, у) of E 
are given by
X, = s. (x cos ф, - у sin ф,) 4-
у = s (x sjn ф, + у cos <f>,) + b„ i = 1, 2,3.
Three homologous points are collinear if |X, Y. 11 = 0, from which, after 
developing the determinant, we see that the locus of the points of E for which 
the three positions in 2 are collinear is a circle C. If C, is C in the ith position, 
the points Pl2, РЛ| and Pb are on Cr, this follows since for Pl2 of Et the first 
and the second position coincide, for the first and third, for Pj, the second 
and the third (at Pn). The conclusion is: Ci is the circumcircle of Pl2, Рм, P»; 
C2 is that of Pn, Pi2, Рч; that of Pn, Pn, P?i; we know that the three circles 
C. pass through H. The radii of C„ C2, G are in the ratio k,: k2: ky.
We now turn to the displacement of lines. From (3.18) it follows that the 
line их 4- vy + w = 0 is transformed into UX + VY + W = 0, such that
U = и cos ф - v sin ф, V = и sin ф 4- v cos ф, 
(3.24) VV = - (а cos ф + b sin ф)и + (a sin ф - b со$ф)и 4- xw.
For three positions defined by s„ ф(, a„ b, (i = 1,2,3) three homologous lines 
are concurrent if | U, V, W, | = 0. If we develop this determinant it is im­
mediately seen that it has u2 + v2 as a factor; indeed: the isotropic lines do 
satisfy the condition. Excluding these trivial cases the condition is seen to be 
linear in u, v, w. The conclusion is: those lines of E for which three positions 
are concurrent belong to a pencil: its vertex is of course a point of E.
We apply this result to the inverse displacements, by interchanging E and 
£. Keeping in mind that if for the direct displacement a point of E moves 
along a line of S then in the inverse displacement a line of X passes 
permanently through a point of E, we obtain: the lines of S which each pass 
through three homologous points of E, all pass through one point. But Р2ЛРп, 
РцРч, Pi2Pi2 are three such lines; we already know that they are concurrent 
(and we have now even given a new proof). Summing up we have: every point

At is an arbitrary point on Ci then A2 and A., are found as the second 
intersections of АУН with C2 and Ci respectively (Fig. 95).
Example 26. Determine A2 and A, if A, coincides with H.
We have seen that the lines I of E such that lb L L pass through one point 
are those of a pencil. Let the vertex of the pencil be denoted by D (in E) and 
the intersection point of 1, by S (in 2). Again making use of the inverse 
motion we conclude: the locus of all S, a figure in J, is the circumcircle c0 of 
the polar triangle. The point D} is the point in E} which acts as H for the 
inverse motion; this implies that D} is the (second) intersection of with 
Co, D2 and Dy are those of P^Ph and Pi2P?2 with this circle. If l> passes 
through Di then l2 and h must pass through D2 and Dy respectively; S is the 
other intersection of each I, and c0 (Fig. 96).

appears as a generalization of the analogous theory in ordinary kinematics; in 
the latter the three positions of each point are determined if the pole triangle 
and hence also its orthocenter is given; in our more general case the 
orthocenter is replaced by an arbitrarily chosen point of 1. In ordinary 
kinematics we have introduced the concept of the basic point A * of a triad of 
homologous points; the latter are the reflections of A * into the sides of the 
po’e triangle. In order to extend this notion to equiform kinematics we make 
use of a transformation T, called an axial affinity, defined as follows. A line a, 
the axis, is given and also a line I (not parallel to a) and a number k, unequal to 
zero or unity (Fig. 97). To transform the arbitrary point A, the line Г is drawn 
through A parallel to I, intersecting a at S. A is transformed by T into A on 
Г, so that SA'= к (SA).
Example 27. Show that the transformation is linear and that the line at infinity is invariant, 
which implies that T is a (special) affinity.

If the pole triangle and the points Pn, P?i» Pj2 are given we define three

and analogously for T2 and T> Let A * be an arbitrary point in the plane 1 
and let T, transform A*  into A*.  We assert that AH A2, A, are three 
homologous points. Obviously T2T[’, being the product of two affine transfor­
mations is an affinity; it transforms A, into A2. By T7‘ the points Pi2. Pn, P*a
 
are transformed into Pl2, Р.п, P»> and these points are transformed by T2 in 
Pl2, Pm, PwJ hence T/I71 transforms Pt2, Рм, Р» into P,2, 
P2>, and since
an affine transformation is determined by three pairs of conjugate points, 
T/T71 transforms a triangle into a similar triangle and it is therefore the 
equiform transformation from position 1 into 2; this concludes the proof 
(Fig. 98).

where c0, cb c2 are constants, Ц», Lt, L2 linear functions and Q,, Q2 quadratic 
functions. The center M of the circle (3.26) has the coordinates - F|/2FO and

YM = c2(x2 -t- у 2)L2(x, y, z ) 4- z Q2(x, y, z ),
ZM = -2z[co(x24- y2)4- гЦх, у, z)],
which is obviously a cubic relationship. It has five singular points; indeed, if A 
coincides with one of the three poles in the moving plane (that is if for 
instance X2 = Xj, Y2 = Y.0 we have XM = YM = ZM - 0 and from (3.27) it 
follows that this is also the case when A coincides with an isotropic point 
(x24-y2 = 0, z =0). This implies that the points of a line ptXM 4-p2YM + 
p>ZM = 0 correspond to those of a cubic curve in the (x, y, z)-plane, every 
cubic passes through the same five singular points. Hence a point M 
corresponds to the intersections of two such curves, the number of 
essential intersections being 3 x 3 - 5 = 4. We have derived the theorem: a 
point of the fixed plane is the circumcenter of four triads of homologous points 
(real or imaginary).

Equiform three positions theory could be treated by means of triangular

Although the concept of “radius of curvature” does not exist in equiform

which expresses the coordinates of M in terms of those of A and the 
instantaneous invariants up to the second order. The right-hand sides are 
cubic polynomials. The formulas (3.40) are of course more complicated than 
those in Euclidean kinematics because they depend on s, and (which are 
zero in the usual theory). But, as R. Muller [1910a] pointed out. there is also 
another important difference: In the elementary case (3.40) can be solved for 
x, y, z, giving (in general) one solution; A determines M. conversely M 
determines A : the relationship between a point and the corresponding center 
of curvature is birational. This is no longer the case in equiform kinematics. 
We shall prove Muller’s theorem: to each M there correspond two points A 
(real or imaginary).
It follows from (3.40) that

which can be verified by direct substitution from (3.40). It is a bilinear relation 
between XM, YM, ZM and x, y, z which yields the equation of a straight line for 
the locus of A if M is given. Furthermore M lies on the path normal of A 
(Fig. 104). Hence, LMAO = (тг/2)- ф. which implies that A is on a specific

Example 51. Show that there are two different real points A if M is outside a certain (rational) 
bicircular quartic with a cusp at О (R. Muller [ 1910a], Krause [ 1920]).
We consider some third order properties: A moving point A will pass 
through an undulation point of its path (the tangent having four coinciding 
points in common with the curve) if X,: У, = X2: У2 = X3: У3. The equality 
of the first two ratios implies that A is on the inflection circle. The condition 
Х,У3-Х3У, = 0 gives us by means of (3.34):

C2 « (2$, + 3s,s2 - s3)(x2 + y2) + (s,b3 - a3)x - (s,a3 + b3)y = 0,
which represents a circle through O. It has in general one real intersection 
with the inflection circle (in addition to the trivial one at O). The conclusion 
is: there is, as a rule, one point passing through an undulation point of its 
path, the point of Ball for equiform kinematics.
Example 52. Determine the coordinates of Ball's point. Consider the special cases: 1) there is no 
proper Ball point because the second intersection of the two circles coincides with O; 2) every 
point of the inflection circle is a Ball point; 3) the inflection circle is degenerate.
Example 53. Show that the intersections of two consecutive inflection circles are the pole and 
Ball's point.
The centers of curvature of the centrodes are also third order concepts. The 
equations of the centrodes are given by (3.16) and (3.17). Let m and f be the 
centers of curvature at О of the moving and the fixed centrode respectively. 
They are on the pole normal. Since we have (xp)o = (yp)o = 0, (xF), = - b2,

We shall give some examples of special continuous motions in plane

where A, B. Af, Bt, A2. B2. C are constants depending on the given data; 
CXO if the three lines L, are not concurrent. Without any loss of generality 
we may suppose that the moving and the fixed frame coincide for Ф = 0. In 
which case С = B, A2 = 0, B: = 0 and the motion is
X = (1/(A sin ф + В cosф))[В(x cos</> - у sin ф)4- A,sin Ф] 
= ((Af- By)u + Bx)/(Au + B),

= ((Bt + Bx)u + By )/(Au 4-В).
with и = tan ф.
As X, Y are linear functions of the parameter и we have: if the paths of 
three points are straight lines the path of every point is a straight line.
From (3.52) we see that X, Y are independent of и if (A, — By) : A = 
x and (Bi 4-Bx): A = у; hence x = (AtA - BtB)/(A24-B2), y = 
(A,B + AB,)/(A2+ B2) is a fixed point during the motion. If we choose it as 
the common origin of the frames we have Af = B, = 0 and the motion reads, 
with A IB = к :
(3.53)
X = (fc sin ф + соьф) \x соьф - у sin ф), 
Y = (к sin ф + cos ф)’'(x sin ф + у cos ф).
For tan ф = - к we have a singular position: all points are at infinity. As the 
X- and У-axes are not yet determined we may take them in such a way that 
the singular position occurs when Ф is equal to tt/2; hence к = 0 and we have 
the following standard representation of the motion
(3.54)
X = (cos ф) ‘(x cos ф - у sin ф), 
Y = (cos ф)-,(х sin ф + у cos ф).
From this it follows, by eliminating Ф. that the path of (x, y) reads
(3.55)
xX + yY - (x2 4- у2) = 0.
Conversely, the line UX + VY 4- W = 0 is the path of the point x = 
- UW/(U2+ V2), у - - VW/(C724- V2), which shows that any line is in 
general the path of some one point. There is therefore a birational quadratic 
relationship between a moving point and its path.
Example 56. Determine the singular elements of this relationship.
The inverse motion of (3.54) is represented by
(3.56) x = сояф(Х cos ф 4- У sin ф), у = cos ф( - X sin ф 4-У cos ф), 
which shows that the path of any point is a circle.

Example 57. Show that the equation of the circle described by (X. У) is x1 + у ’ - xX - yY = 0.
Every path passes through the origin; all the moving points arrive simul­
taneously at this point when the motion parameter reaches the singular value 
ф = ir/2. Any circle through О is a possible path. Every point of the fixed 
plane is the center of one path.
Example 58. Determine the envelope of a moving line for the motion (3.54) and for the inverse 
motion (3.56).
Our example of a continuous motion in the equiform plane is related to a 
well-known problem in elementary geometry. If a triangle ABC is given one 
may study the set of triangles PQR, inscribed into ABC (P on BC, etc.), such 
that PQR is similar to a given triangle PoQoRo. It may be shown that there 
exists one point O, such that its pedal triangle PiQiRi with respect to ABC is 
similar to PnQoRn. The other inscribed triangles follow from PtQ}R} by a 
rotation of angle ф about O, and a dilation with center О and the scale factor 
s = (cos4>)
*'.
 Obviously there appears an equiform motion, the paths of Pb 
Qi, R, being the lines ВС, CA, AB respectively.
If an equiform motion has a fixed point it may be represented by 
X = s(x cos ф - у sin ф), У = s(x sin ф + у cos ф). It is then defined if the 
path of one other point is known.
Example 59. Let a point, (m, 0) say. describe the circle X2 + Y3 - 2MX + D = 0. Determine s; 
show that any point describes a circle. For D = 0 the motion is the one given by (3.56).
Several special motions in equiform kinematics have been investigated by 
Burmester [1874a,b, 1878], Muller [1910c], and Krause [1910]. We mention 
the following results: if the paths of two points are straight lines and that of a 
third point a circle, the path of a general point is a conic; if three points 
describe circles the general path is a tri-circular sextic, the same curve as the 
four-bar coupler curve of ordinary kinematics. Similarly, Krause [1910] has 
pointed out that every planar trajectory generated by an equiform motion is 
also the trajectory of an ordinary (Euclidean) motion. Such results lead to the 
direct extension of Roberts’ formulas (Roberts [1870, 1876]) to equiform 
planar kinematics.

represented by the equation X? + X’ + • • • + XL । = 0. X. being homogeneous 
projective coordinates; for hyperbolic geometry О is of the type Xj+Xj 
+ • • • + Xi- Xi»i = 0. Euclidean geometry is more or less a singular border­
line case between the two; it is in some respect more simple but it lacks their 
elegance. In view of their definitions there exists much similarity between 
elliptic and hyperbolic geometry but there is an essential difference with 
respect to the reality of the quadratic in both cases; in the first fl has no real 
points, in the second there are A projective transformation which leaves 
fl invariant is a non-Euclidean displacement; a continuous set of displace­
ments depending on one parameter t defines a non-Euclidean motion. The 
degree of freedom for both geometries in n-space is equal to that for the 
Euclidean case: *n(n  + 1).
For n 3, especially for the instantaneous case, our knowledge of non- 
Euclidean kinematics is fairly well advanced; there even exists a text-book on 
the subject, the third volume of Garnier’s Cours (Garnier (1951)).
In what follows we give a survey of the matter, restricting ourselves to the 
main topics without dealing with the many special cases which arise.
There is a relationship between elliptic geometry in n-space and Euclidean 
geometry in (n + l)-space: Elliptic geometry is identical with the Euclidean 
geometry of the n-space at infinity, fl playing the role of the isotropic variety. 
This implies a strong resemblance between elliptic л-space geometry and 
spherical Euclidean geometry in (n + l)-space; there is no identity, however, 
because one point at infinity corresponds to two (diametrically opposite) 
points on the (unit) sphere. Elliptic geometry is therefore somewhat simpler 
than the latter. In both a displacement may be represented by
(4.1) 
P = Ap,
A being an orthogonal (n + 1) x (n + 1) matrix; P and p are column matrices 
whose elements are Cartesian coordinates (in E"
*
1) in the Euclidean case and 
homogeneous projective ones (in E") for the elliptic case. For any n the 
matrix A may be expressed in terms of Cayley’s Jn(n 4- 1) parameters c„ as 
discussed in Section 2 of this chapter. The example given there for a 
4 x 4-matrix gives us the general expression for a displacement in elliptic 
3-space.
In view of the foregoing and our discussion about eigenvalues of orthogonal 
matrices (Chapter I, Section 4), a displacement in elliptic 3-space has in 
general four different invariant points on fl composed of two pairs of 
conjugate imaginary points. This implies that it has two real invariant lines I

and Г which are moreover conjugate with respect to Q and therefore 
orthogonal in elliptic geometry. Hence, for a suitably chosen coordinate 
system (the vertices being those of a polar tetrahedron of 0) with homogene­
ous coordinates X, У, Z, W and x, y, 2, w, such a displacement is represented 
by
X = x cos ф - у sin ф, Y = x sin ф + у cos ф, 
(4 2)
Z = 2 cos ф - w sin ф, W = 2 sin ф + w cos ф,
this may be called a screw motion with the two (equivalent) axes I: (x = у = 0) 
and I*:  (2 = w = 0). The invariant points are SH S2 = (1, ± i,0,0) and S4 = 
(0,0,1, ± <). For ф = 0, ф/ 0 and for ф/ 0, ф = 0 we obtain pure rotations. If 
we consider two positions, the first being the reference position ф = ф = 0, 
the coordinates of the lines joining two homologous points are seen to be
pu = X2 sin ф + xw(cos ф - cos ф) + yw sin ф, etc.
Example 60. Determine the six expressions p„ and show thai they satisfy (sin Ф sin&)■ 
(p»4 + 
+ Pм + P?»)e 2(1 - cosф cosФ)р>гр„, which shows thai the locus of the joins of
homologous points is a tetrahedral complex, the associated tetrahedron being StSjSiS4.
If in (4.2) we have Ф = тг, ф = 0 then X = - x. Y = - y> Z = z, W = w, 
which represents a reflection into I. Similarly ф = 0, ф = тг gives a reflection 
into 1*.  The product of these two reflections is a half-turn about both axes. 
The product of reflections into the arbitrary lines h and l2 can be shown to be a 
screw motion, the axes of which are the two common perpendiculars of l( and 
12 (or: the two transversals of the four lines 1>, It, 12, I*).  On the other hand any 
screw motion may be written as the product of two reflections and in many 
ways. By analogous arguments as were used for ordinary kinematics (Chapter 
IV, Section 1) we are then able to treat three positions theory in elliptic space 
by studying the configuration of three arbitrary axes 112, 1», !M: from which 
follow 11* д, 1*|  as their polar lines with respect to Q. and furthermore nb n? 
as the transversals of ll2, IT2, 1ц, I*»,  and analogously n2, n*  and n3, n*.  The 
three homologous positions A, of a point of the moving space are then seen to 
be the reflections into n, of a “fundamental” point A, representing the triplet.
Example 61. Verify that the degree of freedom for the definition of three positions is the same as 
for specifying three arbitrary lines.
We set ourselves the problem of determining, in the theory of three finitely 
separated positions, the locus of the points in the moving space whose three 
homologous positions are collinear. If these are X,, У, Z6 W„ (i = 1,2,3) the 
condition reads: the 4 x 3-matrix ||X( Y, Z. W, || has rank two. Keeping in mind 
that its elements are homogeneous linear functions of x, y, 2, w, and in view of

genera! theorems on determinental loci (see Room [1938]), we conclude that 
the locus in the moving space is a curve Гin of order (32 - 22 + 1 = ) six. It must 
have twelve intersections with fl, in accordance with the fact that it passes 
through the four invariant points of each of the displacements Dl2, D25 and 
Du, which obviously belong to the locus.
It is easily seen that if four finitely separated positions are given, the locus, 
in the moving space, of those points A for which the homologous points A, 
(i = 1,2,3,4) are coplanar is a quartic surface, passing through Г2М, ГмЬ Г412, 
Гщ.
The study of four and more finitely separated positions can follow the 
method of screw triangles presented for the Euclidean case (Chapter V) by 
virtue of the fact that analogous configurations of axes exist for displacements 
in elliptic spaces.
We consider now instantaneous kinematics in elliptic space. Obviously 
there exist two instantaneous screw axes I and Г, conjugate with respect to fl. 
If the frames coincide in the zero-position and if we take I to be x = у = 0 and 
Г therefore z = w = 0, the first order formulas are

where w2 are (time-dependent) instantaneous invariants. In the general 
case u>i(02 / 0 and wi / w2.

orthogonal matrix (Chapter I, (5.7)), and if the six parameters c, are chosen as 
linear functions of the parameter /, we obtain a motion such that the paths are 
in general rational quartic space curves.
Another motion is defined when in (4.2) we take ф and ф as functions of /; 
then we have a continuous screw-motion with fixed axes. A noteworthy 
special case appears if ф = ф; for tan ф = tan ф = t we obtain
(4.7) X = x - yt, Y = xt 4- y, Z = z - wt, W = zt + w,
which implies that every path is a straight line. The motion could be called a 
(pseudo-) translation. Every path has »' common perpendiculars with both 
axes, and all these have equal lengths; a path and an axis are so-called Clifford 
parallels. For t = x every point arrives at the conjugate point to its initial 
position.
Example 71. Show that the set of paths is a tetrahedral complex. All paths are different. 
Example 72. Consider the elliptic motion
X - ax - by - cz,
Y = bx + ay + cw,
Z - ex + az — bw,
W = - cy + bz 4- aw,
where a, b. c are arbitrary functions of r. Show that all paths are plane curves (the point (x, y,z,w) 
moves in the plane wX + zY - yZ - x W = 0) and furthermore that all paths are congruent. 
Every plane contains one path. (Bottema [1944a].)
Example 73. Show that in elliptic space, motions exist analogous to the Darboux motions in 
ordinary kinematics: any path is a conic (Bottema (1944b]).
In hyperbolic space the absolute quadric О may be given the equation 
X2 + Y2 4-Z2 - W2 = 0. Although the corresponding geometry has much 
resemblance to the elliptic one there are, in view of questions about reality, 
striking differences. D now has real points; the points “at infinity’* are those 
on and outside O, the region inside fl is the proper part of the space. Any 
hyperbolic displacement has in general four invariant points on fl; two ($,, S2) 
are real and two (S},&) conjugate imaginary. There are two real invariant 
lines I and I*,  which are conjugate with respect to fl; 1 has points inside fl, I*  is 
completely outside. If we choose them as x - у = 0 and z = w = 0 respec­
tively the displacement is seen to be
X = x cos ф - у sin ф, Y = x sin ф 4- у cos ф, 
(^•8) Z - z cosh ф 4- w sinh Ф, W = z sinh ф + w cosh ф.

with two instantaneous invariants of the first and four of the second order, all 
time-dependent. All second order properties may be derived from (4.11).
Example 78. Derive the formulas for third order properties; they contain six new instantaneous 
invariants.
We mention only two special motions in hyperbolic space. If in (4.8) we 
take ф = 0, ф = t we have rotations about 1, all paths being circles; if ф = 0, 
Ф = t we obtain “translations”, the paths are conics, called “distance lines” or 
circles with their center in the infinite region. The counterpart of (4.7), all 
paths being straight lines, does not exist; there are no (real) Clifford parallels 
in the hyperbolic case.
We finish this section with some remarks about plane non-Euclidean 
kinematics.
In the elliptic plane, with Q э X2 + Y2 + Z2 = 0, any displacement may be 
represented by
(4.12) X = x cos ф - у sin ф, Y = x sin ф + у cos ф, Z = z,
the rotation center is (0,0,1) and the invariant points on D are (1, ±i,0).
Three positions are completely defined by the rotation centers PUy Рм, Ph', 
the rotation angles ф„ are twice the angles of the pole triangle, satisfying the 
inequality ф2У + Фм + ф12>2тг. Three homologous points Ab A2, A? are the 
reflections of a basic point A * into the sides of the pole triangle. The 
circumcenter of Ab A2, Аз is the isogonal conjugate (with respect to the pole 
triangle) of A *.  The locus of points A * such that A>, A2, A3 are collinear is a 
cubic curve passing through the three rotation centers and through six points 
of Q. All these properties follow by specializing the spatial results.
Instantaneous elliptic plane kinematics up to the third order is given by the 
scheme (derived from the general theory of Chapter II, (2.5), (2.7) analog­
ously to Chapter II, (5.10))

-02x(x2 + y2+z2)+w2(x2 + y2)z =0,
which represents a cubic curve, passing through О (with tangent x = 0) and 
intersecting (actually, touching) О three times at each of the points (1, ± i, 0).
If X(r), Y(t), Z(t) is a curve in the fixed plane and if we normalize the 
homogeneous coordinates by the condition X2+ Y2 + Z2 = 1, then the line 
coordinates of the normal are (X, Y, Z); the center of curvature M of the 
curve, the intersection of two consecutive normals, is therefore 
(4.15) XM=YZ-ZY, Ym = ZX-XZ, Zm = XY-YX.
Hence instantaneously the normal at A(x, y, z) coincides with О A and the 
center M is, in view of (4.13):
(4.16a) XM = /32x2, YM = 02xy, ZM = p2xz - w2(x2 4- у2),
and conversely
(4.16b) x = 02X2m, у = p2XMYMy z = p2XMZM 4- ш2(Х2м 4- Y2M).
The formulas (4.16) express the birational quadratic relationship between a 
point A and the corresponding center of curvature M. They are in terms of 
projective coordinates. И we introduce elliptic metrics, the distances О A and 
OM being p and pi respectively and Z.XOA = /LXOM = 0, then we have 
from the well-known formulas

The reader should note that here the angle 6 is measured to the ray (i.e., 
О A) from the common normal of the centrodes. If, as is customary, we 
measure the ray angle from the pole tangent then we use the angle tj

such that 0 = 77 - it/2 and therefore

Example 79. Show that for any point on Or, different from O, the corresponding center M 
coincides with O.
Example 80. Show that there are at any moment three acceleration poles.
Example 81. Verify that Oy is the pole tangent.
We mention some third order properties of the motion. A Ball point is on 
the inflection curve and also satisfies the equation |X, Y, Z( | « 0, i = 0,1,3. 
From this determinant and (4.14) we obtain yzУл + xzX, - (x2 + y2)Z4 = 0, 
which in view of (4.13) represents a cubic curve, passing through О (but with 
its tangent different than Oy) and through (1, ±i,0). There are therefore in 
general (3 x 3 - 3 = ) six Ball points. The circling point curve is the locus of 
points with the property that three consecutive normals are concurrent. 
Hence its equation reads | X, Yt Z, | = 0, i = 1,2,3, which follows explicitly 
from (4.13). It is a cubic curve.
Example 82. Determine from (4.13) the centers of curvature of the fixed and the moving 
centrodes at O.
We mention some special continuous motions in the elliptic plane. If the 
general displacement is written in terms of the Euler parameters c, (i = 
0,1,2,3) and if we take these to be linear functions of t we have defined a 
motion whose paths are all conics.
It has been shown that the motion (comparable with Cardan motion in the 
ordinary plane) such that two points move on perpendicular lines has the 
following properties: the paths are quartic curves of genus one, with three 
centers and are tangent to Q four times; the fixed centrode is a quartic, the 
moving one a conic; the paths of the inverse motion are curves of order eight 
and genus one. (Bottema [1975a]).
Kinematics in the hyperbolic plane is more complicated than that in the 
elliptic plane because several cases must be distinguished. It has been treated 
by Garnier [1951], Frank [1971], T6lke [1974] and others.
A displacement has two invariant points on the absolute conic 
x2 + y2 - z2 = 0. If they are imaginary their join is real and the third invariant 
point lies inside D; if they are real the latter is outside П; there is a special

being the only invariant line.
In the first case the displacement is given, using a suitably chosen 
coordinate system, by
(4.18) X = x cos$ - у sin ф, Y = x sin </> + у cos </>, Z = z,
the center being (0,0,1). In the second case we obtain
(4.19) X = x, Y - у cosh ф + z sinh ф, Z = у sinh ф + z cosh Ф,
with the center (1,0,0) outside ft. For the sake of completeness we mention 
the borderline case, which in rational form may be written
X = (I - |u’)x 4- uy + \u2z, Y = - их + у + uz,
z = ~iU2X 4- uy 4-(l 4- Ju2)z.
Example 83. Show that (4.20) leaves D in vanant; the only invariant point is (1,0,1) and the 
invariant line is x - z “0. Prove that the eigenvalues of the transformation matrix are all equal to 
one.
Example 84. Write (4.18) and (4.19) in rational form.
Hyperbolic three positions theory may be dealt with in the same way as the 
Euclidean and the elliptic case. Three positions are again determined by three 
rotation centers PJb Pu, but as each of them may be either inside or 
outside ft (or, in the bordeline case, on ft) for a complete treatment several 
possibilities must be taken into account. The concept of the fundamental (or 
basic) point representing a triple of homologous points still holds but the 
“isogonal relationship” must be modified.
Obviously for instantaneous kinematics three different cases must be 
considered. Restricting ourselves to the two main cases we have for the first

(4.18) ф is variable, any path is a circle. If in (4.19) ф is variable, all paths are 
(“concentric”) distance lines. If и is variable in (4.20) any path is a so-called 
horicycle, a conic which has four coinciding points in common with Q.
Example 90. Show, by modifying the Euler parameters for the hyperbolic plane, that there are 
motions whose paths are conics.
5. Affine kinematics
Affine geometry in 3-space deals with those properties which are invariant 
for general linear transformations of three non-homogeneous coordinates. 
An affine displacement is represented by
(5.1) 
P = Ap + d,
where P and p are column vectors whose elements are the three coordinates 
in the fixed and moving space, A is an arbitrary 3 x 3-matrix and d a column 
vector giving the displacement of the origin. An affine space has therefore 12 
degrees of freedom. If Д = |А|, we suppose Д/0 thus excluding singular 
affinities. Euclidean and equiform displacements are sub-groups of the affine 
group. Another sub-group is that for which Д = 1. It is called the equiaffine 
group and the corresponding differential geometry has been developed by 
Blaschke [1923]. Affine geometry is less specialized and therefore less rich in 
concepts than Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. It is itself a sub­
geometry of projective geometry and may be defined as dealing with those 
projective transformations which leave a special plane, the plane at infinity, 
invariant. Affine geometry admits parallel lines, and also the ratio of distances 
on the same or on parallel lines as well as the ratio of volumes (volumes 
according to (5.1) are multiplied by Д). The concept of angle or of orthogonal­
ity is unknown in affine geometry.

at infinity is invariant and there are no finite invariant points. Excluding this 
special case and some others for which the eigenvalues of A are not ail 
distinct, we have in general one finite invariant point and three invariant 
points Bi, Bi at infinity, either all three are real or one is real and two are 
conjugate imaginary. Hence by a suitable choice of frames an affine displace­
ment may be represented by
(5.2) 
X = a.x, Y = a,yt Z = a.at
or by
(5.3) 
X = a,(x cos</> - у sin Ф), Y = a,(x sin d> 4- у cos<£
with a, / 0, a, / 1.
Example 91. 
Show (hat there are three finite invariant lines and three finite invariant planes, real 
or imaginary.
Example 92. Show that (5.2) is an equiaffine displacement if a tata» = 1; (5.3) is one if a fa, » 1.
Either formulas (5.2) or (5.3) give the conditions for a two-positions theory 
in affine space. We consider one application: In (5.2) the line coordinates of 
the join of two homologous points are seen to be
Рм = /|X, 
p24 = 
Pm = lyZ.
Р2У = (/2 - A)yz, Ph = (/, - /,)zx, 
p,3 = (/, - /2)xy.
with I, = a, - 1.
Hence the locus of these joins is given by
(5.5) 
/2АР14Р2Л+ A/1P24P.M + /i/.pupiz = 0,
which represents a tetrahedral complex, the corresponding tetrahedron being 
that of the three coordinate planes and the plane at infinity.
Example 93. 
Show (hat the (constant) cross-ratio of the four intersections of a join and the faces 
of the tetrahedron is (for a certain order of the points) equal to l/h - /7)/(/Д/, - /»))•

in the case given by (5.3), determine the coordinates of the join of two homologous 
points and the equation of the locus (of joins).

motion. In the instantaneous case we obtain for the first order

X, = b,x, Yi = b2y. Z}~biZy

(5.7)

Example 96. Show that for equiaffine kinematics we have bt + b3 + b, = 0 in (5.6). and 2b + b, =

By (5.2) and (5.3) the canonical frames are completely determined. From 
this it follows that expressions for the second order quantities X2, Y21 Z2 are 
arbitrary non-homogeneous linear functions of x, y, z, which implies that we 
have 12 instantaneous invariants for the second order.
Example 97. If U, (i « 1,2,3,4) arc the coordinates of the osculating plane of the path, show 
that U, (i » 1,2,3) are quadratic functions of x, y. z and is a cubic function.
Example 98. Determine the pole tangent, in terms of the first and the second order instantane­
ous invariants, both in the fixed and the moving space and show that they coincide.
We consider now plane affine kinematics. The general displacement is 
represented by
(5.8) 
X = ax 4- py + а, Y = yx + 5y + b.
It has one finite and two infinite invariant points; the latter can be real or 
imaginary. We shall restrict ourselves to the first case. Moreover we deal with 
the interesting case of equiaffine geometry; hence ad - Py = 1. If we take the 
invariant points as the vertices of the coordinate frame the displacement has 
the standard form
(5.9) 
X = bx, Y = b'y.
Example 99. Determine the condition for a, /3. % 5 so that the invariant points at infinity are 
real and distinct.
If in (5.8) the six parameters are functions of t it represents an affine 
motion; it is an equiaffine motion if Д = «6 - py = 1 for any value of t. We 
develop instantaneous equiaffine kinematics in the following way: If the fixed 
and the moving frame coincide in the zero-position we have a0=6(, = 1, 
p0 = y0 = a» = bn = 0. If furthermore the common origin is chosen at the pole 
(the finite fixed point) and Ox, Oy along the (real) invariant lines, we obtain 
/3, = yi =

The canonical frames are now determined. There is one (time-dependent) 
instantaneous invariant of the first order. From (5.10) it follows that the path 
tangent at the point A(x, y) is

yX + xY-2xy =0.

tic relationship between a point and the tangent to its path; determine its singular elements.
From Д2 = 0 it follows that = 2a? and we obtain the second order 
formulas

with the five new (time-dependent) invariants e, /32, y2* 
b2. The condition
that the path has an inflection point (which is a geometrical property) reads 
Xt Y2- X2 Yi = 0; hence using (5.10) and (5.12) the equation of the inflection 
curve is seen to be
(5.13) 
y2x2 + 2ajxy 4- fl2y2 4- b2x + a2y - 0,
which represents a conic Г, passing through O, the tangent at О being 
b2x + a2y = 0.
Example 103 The point of the moving plane coinciding with О passes through a cusp of its path; 
show that with respect to Ox and Ov. the cuspidal tangent is harmonic with the tangent to Г.
Example 104. Derive the condition for Г to be an ellipse, a parabola, a hyperbola or a 
degenerate curve.
A parametric representation of Г is
(5.14) 
x = - (a2m + b2)/N, у = - m(a2m 4- b2)/N; N = y24-2afm 4-/32m
(here, m is the parameter).
Hence, from (5.11), the coordinates of the path tangent of a point on Г are
(5.15) 
Ui = mN, U2 = N, Uj = 2m(a2m 4- b2),
which shows that the locus of the inflection tangents is a (rational) curve C3 of 
the third class.

The moving centrode is determined by X = Y = 0. For t = 0 the pole is the 
origin. If x = pj, у = q,t is the pole position up to the first order, we obtain 
Pi = - вз/аь qt-b2/ai. This implies that the pole tangent in the moving 
plane has the equation b2x + a2y = 0, which means that it coincides with the 
tangent at О to Г. Moreover it is easily seen that this line is also the tangent at 
О to the fixed centrode.
Equiaffine plane kinematics is much more complicated than ordinary plane 
kinematics, although there is some similarity as we saw in the preceding. An 
important difference is that in the Euclidean case there is a natural geometric 
parameter, the rotation angle, which has no counterpart in affine geometry. 
Moreover a curvature theory of paths which in ordinary kinematics can be 
based on second order properties depends in affine geometry on higher 
derivatives. The affine-normal of a curve, introduced by Blaschke [1923] 
depends on third order concepts; indeed, it may be defined as the axis of the 
parabola which has four coinciding points in common with the curve. The 
center of curvature, being the intersection of two consecutive affine normals, 
is then a fourth order concept.
It must be mentioned that affine kinematics has been considered from a 
different point of view by Burmester [1874b, 1878, 1902] and by Pelzer 
[1959]. Their investigations treat the case where the geometry of the moving 
plane is affine while that of the fixed plane is still Euclidean. Contrary to this 
TOlke [1967] considers affine kinematics proper but his “pseudo-curvatures” 
are not those of pure affine differential geometry, because they are not 
defined as intrinsic properties of the paths.
Making use of Д3 = 0 the third order formulas are seen to be
X3 = (3aiE + v)x + /З3у + a3,
Yj = УзХ + (3ai£ - p)y + h3,
and we have five new invariants p, y3, a3, by.
The equation of the inflection curve is XY - XY = 0, which implies that its 
intersections with the next consecutive inflection curve satisfy XY - XY = 0, 
that is, for t = 0: X|Y3- X3Yi = 0, which in terms of x, у is
(5.17) 
y>x + 6ai£xy + 03y  + b3x + a3y = 0.

This represents a conic through O. It has in general three intersections with 
(5.13) different from O. The conclusion is: there are instantaneously three 
points of the moving plane (the points of Ball) passing through an undulation 
point of their path; at least one of these is real.

We shall develop a method to determine the affine normal of the path at a 
given point A (x, у) of the moving plane. To that end we consider the pencil of 
conics having four consecutive points A in common with the path. One of 
these conics (the trivial parabola of the pencil) is the tangent counted twice; 
its equation is Ki = (yX + xY - 2xy)2 = 0. As a second conic of the pencil we 
take the one through O, its equation reads
(5.18) 
K2 = BHX2 + 2B12XY 4- B22 Y2 4-2BnX 4-2B23Y = 0,
B„ being as yet unknowns. The equation of the pencil is K2 + A Ki = 0. Its two 
parabolas follow from the discriminant of the quadratic terms of K2 4- A K, = 
0: (Вц + Ay2) (B22 4-Ax2)-(Bl24-Axy)2 = 0; for the non-trivial parabola we 
have (x2Bu-2xyBi24-y2B22)A + (ВцВ22 - B?2) = 0.
Substituting this value of A into the pencil, it follows that the quadratic 
terms of the non-trivial parabola are: [(Bux - Buy)X - (B22y - BI2x)Y]2, 
and if the point at infinity on its axis is (XN, YN, 0), the affine normal to the 
trajectory is given by

To determine Bt) we substitute
X = Xo 4- X.r 4- {X2r2 4- (l/6)X3f,
Y= Yo4- Y.r 4-J Y2r2 4-(1/6) Y,r3
into (5.18) and write out the conditions that the terms tk (к = 0,1,2,3) vanish; 
XK and YK are given by (5.10), (5.12) and (5.16). We obtain four linear 
equations for the five homogeneous unknowns B1;. It is easy to verify that (in 
all four) the coefficient of Bn has the factor x and that of B22 the factor y, 
from which follows a set of four homogeneous linear equations for Bux, B!2, 
В22У, Ви, B2„ the coefficients of BI2 being polynomials of x, у of order two (at 
most) while all others are linear. If we solve the set, Bnx and B22y appear as 
quintic polynomials and Bx2 as a quartic. Hence, from (5.19): the direction 
numbers of the affine normal at A (x, у) are quintic polynomials of x, у; they 
depend on the eleven instantaneous invariants which define the time­
dependent motion up to the third order. The relationship between a point and 
its affine normal seems too cumbersome to write explicitly.
Example 109. Show that this procedure does not hold for a point A on Ox or on Оr. Consider 
these cases separately.

AFFINE KINEMATICS
497
The affine curvature center of a path (defined as the center of the conic 
which has five coinciding points in common with the path) may be determined 
from a development along similar lines. We need then the fourth order 
expressions.
Example 110. Determine X4 and in terms of x. y; they contain five new invariants.
Affine differential geomt ry defines also the number k, the affine curvature 
of a plane curve. It may be expressed (Blaschke [1923]) as
(5.20) 
к =(12Di2D23-5D?j + 3DuD14)/(9D^),
where D„ stands for X,Y, - X,Y„ which is a quadratic polynomial in x, y. We 
have D{2 = 0 for a point on the inflection curve and also D,5 = 0 for a Ball 
point; к = 0 means that five consecutive points of the path are on a parabola. 
It follows from (5.20) that the locus of those points is a quartic curve of the 
moving plane.
We give some examples of special continuous plane equiaffine motions. A 
simple case appears if the three (instantaneous) invariant points are fixed 
during the motion. If those at infinity are real we have
(5.21) 
X = ex, Y = c"ly.
The paths are in general hyperbolas, and straight lines for points on Ox or Oy; 
the inflection curve is degenerate. A more interesting case is the following 
(Bottema [1964b]): The equiaffine plane has five degrees of freedom. Hence 
the paths in the fixed plane 1 may be prescribed for four points of the moving 
plane E. We obtain a generalization of the Euclidean Cardan motion if we 
suppose that the paths of four points are straight lines. The main results are: 
There is a conic К in E all points of which describe straight lines. К is 
obviously the inflection curve, and the locus of the straight lines (called the 
station-yard) is the curve of the third class C5 obtained from (5.15). The 
four original points may be replaced by any quadruple of points on K. At 
every instant К is tangent to Cj at three points. The path of an arbitrary point 
of E is a conic. The center of К also describes a conic. К is the moving 
centrode; the fixed centrode is a quartic curve. The motion is not determined 
by the yard', there are »' different conics whose points may move along the 
rails of a given yard. There are two main cases: К can be an ellipse or a 
hyperbola, the parabola being a special case. In the aforementioned paper 
standard representations of the motion are determined.
A two-parameter affine plane motion is obtained from

represent the unit transformation. Consider a one-parameter motion u(r), 
v(t) belonging to the set, with u(0) = v(0) = 0. If for f(u, v) we denote 
(df/du)(0,0) by Д and (d/7dt>)(0,0) by Д, the finite pole of the one-parameter 
motion follows from
0 = (aMu, +

0 =

and it is seen to be at
(5.24) 
x = Q.(m )/Q,(m), у = Q2(m )/Q4(m),
where Q, are quadratic expressions in m = ujv{. Hence the locus of possible 
poles is, in general, a conic. (H. R. Muller [1958]).
Example 111. Show that this statement holds also for equiaffine motions.
6. Projective kinematics
Although projective differential geometry has been developed extensively 
(see Bol [1950]) and use has been made there of kinematical concepts, 
projective kinematics proper (in the sense of the present book, considering 
sets of transformations of the entire space) has not drawn much attention. If 
we remember the complications arising in the more special case of affine 
kinematics this is quite understandable. The general projective transforma­
tion in 3-space is represented by
(6.1) 
P = Ap,
where P and p are column vectors in respectively the fixed and the moving 
space, the elements of which are four homogeneous point coordinates, and A 
is a 4 x 4-matrix with | A| / 0 if we exclude singular phenomena. In general, 
that is if the eigenvalues of A are all distinct, there are four invariant points, 
the vertices of a tetrahedron. Using suitable frames (6.1) may be written
(6.2) 
X = ax, Y = /Зу, Z = yz, W = 8w.
Example 112. Show that in the general two positions theory the locus of the joins of homologous 
points is a tetrahedral complex; determine its equation from (6.2).
If the eigenvalues of A in (6.1) are not all different several cases must be 
considered, depending on the so-called invariant factors of the matrix. Not

only the multiplicity of an eigenvalue is important but moreover the rank of 
the matrix A - Al when the eigenvalue is substituted for A. The theory gives 
rise to 13 types of projective transformations, each with its standard represen­
tation and with its configuration of invariant points, lines and planes.
Obviously the projective space has 15 degrees of freedom. A projective 
motion is defined if the 16 (homogeneous) elements of A are given as 
functions of t. For the instantaneous case there are in general four different 
poles; with respect to suitably chosen canonical frames we have
(6.3) 
Xt = A|X, Y| = A2y, Z| = A3z, W, « A4w,
which means there are essentially three instantaneous invariants of the first 
order.
Example 113. Show that the complex of path tangents is a tetrahedral complex.
The canonical frames are completely determined by first order properties. 
Each additional order introduces 15 more invariants. However, Xn, Y„, Z„, Wn 
are still homogeneous linear functions of x, y, z. w and this gives rise to some 
general theorems.
Example 114. Show that the inflection curve is of the sixth order.
Example 115. Show that the coordinates of the osculating plane of a path are cubic functions of 
those of the moving point.
Example 116. A path may have a stationary osculating plane, which means that four consecutive 
points are coplanar. Show that the locus of those points is a quartic surface.
The formulas (6.3) must be modified if the first order transformation is not 
of the general type (with four different eigenvalues).
The projective plane has eight degrees of freedom. A displacement has in 
general three invariant points, the vertices of a triangle.
Example 117. Determine Xlt Ylt Z, for canonical frames, there are two instantaneous 
invariants of the first order.
Example 118. Show that there are eight invariants for each order л > I.
Example 119. Show that the inflection curve is a cubic.
The different types of plane projective displacements (being six in number) 
have been investigated from the view point of kinematics by Frank [1968], 
with special attention to first order properties in each case.
A kinematics theory may be associated with any geometry. This can be 
done for instance for (plane) Mobius geometry, which can be defined as 
dealing with those properties which are invariant under Euclidean displace­
ments and inversions. Its region is the Euclidean plane to which one point (“at 
infinity”) is added and it is therefore identical with the so-called “complex

plane”, introduced by Gauss and others to visualize the set of complex 
numbers. A displacement in the Mobius geometry corresponds to a linear 
transformation of these numbers and it depends therefore on six (real) 
parameters. Mobius kinematics has been studied by some authors (Lehmann 
(1967]).
Outside the scope of this book lie such subjects as topological kinematics 
and kinematics in metric spaces. They have developed into autonomous 
branches of the science of kinematics and make use of much more sophisti­
cated mathematical tools than are applied in this work.

CHAPTER XIII
SPECIAL MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN KINEMATICS
1. Plane kinematics by means of complex numbers
We consider a Euclidean plane E with the Cartesian frame Олу and we let 
the point (x, у) correspond to the complex number x + iy. This is since Gauss’ 
time the well-known method to visualize complex numbers. E is often 
denoted as “the complex plane” but as it is essentially real we shall call E the 
Gaussian plane. It is the image of the set of all points, real and imaginary, of a 
line.
Plane Euclidean geometry has been treated by means of complex numbers, 
considering the plane as Gaussian (Coolidge [1940], Zwikker [1950], Mor­
ley and Morley [1954]), and some interesting and elegant results have been 
found. The (finite) Euclidean plane and the Gaussian plane are essentially 
identical but an important difference appears if infinite elements are intro­
duced. In the preceding chapters of this book we extended our spaces to 
become projective spaces. In particular our plane has been closed by a line at 
infinity; the Gaussian plane, however, is made complete by one point at 
infinity. Moreover our treatment has often made use of imaginary points; so, 
for instance, the isotropic points play an important part in our theory. The 
Gaussian plane has no imaginary points at all.
Euclidean plane kinematics has been systematically developed in the 
Gaussian plane (Bereis [1958]). Some results are elegant but (in addition to 
the fact that the method is essentially restricted to two dimensions) it cannot 
be said that its use has per se advanced the subject very much. For the sake of 
completeness we give here some basic relationships.
A displacement in the plane is given by (1.1) of Chapter VIII,
(1.1) 
X = x cos ф - у sin ф + a, Y = x sin ф + у cos ф + b.
Introducing the complex numbers Z = X + iY, z = x + iy, c = a + ib the 
formulas (1.1) can be written as one relation
(1.2) 
Z = e‘z  + c.

Ф is a real and c a complex number; hence the general displacement (1.2) 
depends on three real parameters.
(1.2) represents a time-dependent motion if ф and c are given as functions 
of t, the (real) time. Differentiation with respect to t gives us

to be

fixed centrode follows from (1.4) and (1.2):
(1.5) 
Zp = ic<t>~' + c.
If we deal with geometrical (time-independent) kinematics we may take Ф = t 
(and therefore ф = 1, ф = 0). If, moreover, we suppose that for t = 0 the two 
frames coincide we have c0 = 0. And if we take the origin at the pole for the 
zero-position we have Ci = 0.
Example 1. 
Show that for t = 0 we obtain ZF e zp » ic2, which means that the two centrodes are 
tangent at O.
Example 2. 
If our canonical frames are introduced show that c2 is an imaginary number.
Differentiating (1.3) we obtain for t = 0
(1.6) 
Z2 = - z + c2,
which if we set Z2 = 0 gives us the point we call the “geometrical acceleration 
pole” (also called the “second geometrical pole” or simply the “second-order 
pole”) P2'.

Show that Рг is the inflection pole and | c,| the diameter of the inflection circle.

2. Isotropic coordinates

again restricted to the plane, is the use of the so-called isotropic coordinates

(Haarbleicher [1933]). Here we introduce complex numbers for real con­
cepts, but in contradiction to the method of Section 1 we suppose the 
Euclidean plane to be extended to a projective one. If O„ is a Cartesian 
frame the isotropic coordinates x.y of a point (x, y) are defined by
(2.1)
x = x + iy, у = x - iy.
The idea is that the isotropic points Ц (1, i, 0) and I2 (1, - i,0) are transformed 
into (0,1,0) and (1,0,0) which simplifies some equations, such as those of 
circular curves (especially circles), and some analytical relationships, such as 
those expressing orthogonality. Furthermore (2.1) are linear (and also affine) 
transformations so that the degree of a curve remains unaltered. But there is, 
of course, a considerable loss because real points may have complex 
coordinates (and conversely too).
Example 5. Show that the coordinate axes have the equations x + у = 0 and x - у = 0.
Example 6. Show that the circle (O;R) has the equation xy = R .1
Example 7. Show that the lines у « m,x and у  mpr are perpendicular if m, + m3 = 0.

3. Dual numbers
In the two preceding sections use was made of common complex numbers. 
We introduce now a less known type of algebra, developed in the mid­
nineteenth century by Clifford and systematically applied to kinematics by 
Study [1891,1903] and Kotel nikov [1895], and after them by many others.

Example 11. Determine the equation of the circling point curve in isotropic coordinates.
The exercises give an impression of the pertinent formulas for isotropic 
coordinates. The method has been used to advantage for some special 
problems in elementary plane geometry and, as far as kinematics is con­
cerned, for the study of the four-bar sextic and its various special cases 
(Groenman [1950]).

[CH. 13ЛЗ
The dual number system is a “complex” system with two units just as in 
ordinary complex numbers. An element of the latter is a + ib, a and b are 
real numbers and i is defined by i2 = - 1. A dual number is given by a 4- eb, 
with a and b real and e defined by e2 = 0. Addition, subtraction and 
multiplication exist for any pair and they are commutative, associative and 
distributive. The following rules are valid
0f = e0 = 0, ae = ea, (a,+ eb,) + (a2 + eb2) = 
+ a2 + f(6|4- b2),
(fli + Ebi)(a2+ eb2) = a,a2 4- е(Д|Ь2 + a2bx).
If at + eb, = a2+ eb2 then a, = a2, b, - b2.
The system, however, is not a field (as is the case for real and for complex 
numbers) because a product may be zero without any of the factors being 
zero; indeed (ея)(еЬ) = 0, for any a and b. Hence division is not always 
possible: it has no sense if the divisor is of the type eb, in which case it is a 
“pure dual” number. Division by a 4- eb, a/0, however, is possible and 
unambiguous:
(at + ebi)/(a + eb) = (a, 4- eb,)(a - eb)la2 
(3
*1)
 
= (at/a)4- e(ab\ - axb)la2.
We can define the function of a dual number f(a 4- eb) by expanding it 
formally in a Taylor series with e as variable. Because f" =0 if n > 1 we 
obtain
(3.2) 
f(a + eb) = t(a) + et'(a)
where f(a) is f(a 4- eb) at e = 0 and f'(a) is (df(a 4- eb)/de) evaluated at e = 0.
Example 12. Show
sin(a + eb) « sin a + eb cos a, 
cos(a + eb) ■ cos a - eb sin a, 
cot(a eb) = cot a - rh/sin2 a, sin a / 0, 
(a + eb)in = a+ eb/(2a'"), a > 0.
If p and q are two vectors, say in Euclidean 3-space, such that p = 
(Р1,р2,рз), q = (<?ь<?2><?э) we define a dual vector by p 4- eq, its components 
being three dual numbers:
p + Ff = (p, 4- fQj, p2 4- eq2, p3 4- eq3).
We mention the following rules. A dual vector may be multiplied by a (dual) 
scalar

(3.3) 
(a + eb)(p + eq)= ap + e(aq 4- bp).
For the scalar product of two dual vectors we have
(3.4) 
(p + eq)-(r + es) = p-r + e(p • s+5 • r),
and for the vectorial product
(3.5) 
(p 4- Eq)x(r + es) = p x r 4- e(p x $ + q x r).
Example 13. Express the right-hand side of (3.4) and (3.5) in terms of the components of the four 
ordinary vectors p. q. r, t.
Certain results in spatial kinematics can be obtained directly from the 
analogous spherical case using a process we call dualization. It is simply 
necessary to replace all the quantities in a “spherical equation” by their dual 
analogs. To illustrate this we consider equation (3.1) of Chapter V, which 
gives an expression for the angle between the lines ibki. If we replace the 
vectors by their duals, so that slk —► stk 4- es'lk, etc., and the angle by its dual, 
i.e.» ф,к -♦ d>lk 4- ed,kt then the expression (5.10) of Chapter V, for the distance 
between ib kt follows.
Example 14. Show that dualizing (3.1) of Chapter V, results in two ordinary vector equations. 
The “proper” (or real) part is simply V. (3.1) while the dual part is (5.10) of Chapter V.
In Section 5 we will employ a similar procedure to map points from the 
elliptic plane into lines in 3-space. The notion of dualizing takes its validity 
from a general principle known as the transfer principle, which was apparently 
formulated independently by E. Study and A. P. Kotel’nikov. The principle 
and its realms of application are discussed by Dimentberg [1965, 1971].
4. The motion of a line in three-space
Rather unexpectedly dual numbers have been applied to study the motion 
of a line in space; they seem even to be the most appropriate apparatus for 
this end. It was first done by Study [1891] and since his time dual numbers 
have an established place in kinematics as a tool with which to attack 
problems dealing with lines in space. There exists a vast literature on the 
subject (for example: Blaschke [1958], Keler [1959], Yang and Freuden- 
stein [1964], Dimentberg [1965, 1971], Roth [1967], Yuan et al. [1971], 
T6lke [1976], Veldkamp [1976]).
The application of dual numbers to the lines of 3-space is carried out by a 
mapping of the (finite) lines on a set of points. This has been done by two

different although related methods. In one of them oriented lines, called 
spears, are considered. A spear is defined as a line along which there is a given 
direction; any line corresponds to two opposite spears. A line 1 is determined 
by its Pliicker vectors q, q't satisfying the fundamental condition q *4=0.  
For any line not at infinity we have q/ 0. A spear is given a unit vector in the 
line’s Pliicker direction, hence q2 = 1; that for the opposite spear is then - q. 
We represent the spear by the dual vector q = q + eq\ a vector in a dual 
3-space, 1(d). From q2 = 1 and q -q' = 0 it follows that q2 = 1, q is a unit 
vector. Now if one considers the given spear as being represented by (i.e.. 
mapped onto) the endpoint of q, it follows that the spears are mapped onto 
the points of the unit sphere S in 1(d). Opposite spears correspond to 
diametrical points on S. Any point on S is the image of a spear.
Under any displacement in 3-space there is a linear transformation of the 
Pliicker coordinates of 1 and it induces in 1(d) a linear transformation which 
leaves S invariant, which means S undergoes a Euclidean rotation about the 
origin. Hence kinematics in 3-space with spears as moving elements corre­
sponds to spherical kinematics in 1, as dealt with in Chapter VII.
We shall not follow this idea here but make use of a somewhat different 
mapping, not of spears but of non-oriented lines. Therefore we introduce a 
projective dual plane U. A point of U is defined as a triplet of three dual 
numbers (x, y, f), with the provision that not all three are pure duals ; 
furthermore (x, y, f) is identical with the point (px, py, pi), p being any non 
pure-dual factor. Hence x, y, z are homogeneous coordinates. The coordi­
nates of a point (x, y, f) will be called normalized if x2+y2+f2 is a real 
number. If x = x + ex*,  у = у 4- z = z + ez' and p = p + ep\ p/ 0, we 
have X(px)2 = X [px + E(px' +p'x)]2 = p2X x2 +2Ep[p S xx'+p'Ex2] which 
implies that the coordinates may always be normalized by a suitable choice of 
p7p. They remain normalized if multiplied by a non-zero real factor. Using 
the dual plane U the mapping is defined as follows: If the line I in finite 
3-space is determined by the Pliicker vectors (41,42,43), (41,42,49 it is 
mapped on the point L(q^q2,4.3) of U, with q, = 4, + eq', and therefore with 
normalized coordinates in view of X 4,4! = 0. For a line I, not at infinity, not all 
q, are zero and therefore L is indeed a point of U. On the other hand any 
point L may be given normalized coordinates and hence it corresponds to a 
unique line I located in finite 3-space. The relationship between this mapping 
and that of oriented lines onto the points of the unit sphere S comes to this: 
two opposite spears, represented by diametrically opposite points of S 
correspond to the same diameter and the direction of the diameter corre­
sponds to a point of U.

thogonal matrix and d - (d^d2,dy) is the displacement vector of the origin. 
Here we take x and x + q as the two points which define the line, using 
g' = q xx and recalling that each element of A equals its minor we get:
Qi = a i >q j 4- al2q2 4- aiyqy, Q2 = a2lqi + a22q2 + a2yqy,
Оз =

If the line (q, q’) is mapped on the point (x, y, z) of U and (Q, Q') on (X, Y, Z)

Example 21. Determine A if the displacement in 3-spacc is a translation (а, = 6J.
From (4.4) it follows that (4.3) leaves the quadratic form x2+y2+z2 
invariant. This implies that (4.3) is an elliptic displacement in U in the sense of 
the non-Euclidean metrics developed in Chapter XII, Section 4. Euclidean 
geometry in 3-space with the lines as elements corresponds to elliptic geometry 
(of the points) in the dual plane U.
In ordinary elliptic geometry, in a real plane, the distance Ф between two 
points (Xi,y,,Zj) and (x2, y2, z2) is defined by
(4.5) 
cos t/t = (xiX24-y,y24- ztz2)/((x?4-y?4- z?),/2(x24- yj + zj)172),
which gives us (because the right-hand side is a number a satisfying 
- 1 a 1) always real values for Ф. If for instance the homogeneous 
coordinates (Xi,yi,Zj) are multiplied by a negative number, a is replaced by 
- a. This implies that ф is not unambiguously defined; even if we restrict Ф to 
Ос ф < n it may be changed into n - ф. This is natural in elliptic geometry 
and it is related to the circumstance that in this geometry the total length of a 
line is finite and equal to n.
In our dual plane we define the distance between two points (x,, yb zt) and 
(x2, y2, z2) in an analogous way. We suppose that both points are given 
normalized coordinates which as we know is always possible. Making use of 
(4.2) we obtain for the dual distance Ф = ф + еф':
cos(<£ +

where (q„q't), (r„ r',) are the Pliicker coordinates of the two lines represented 
by these two points. Keeping in mind that соь(ф 4- еф') = cos ф - Ei/r'sin Ф 
and comparing (4.6) with the formulas for the distance and the sine and cosine 
of the angle between the two lines, we have the following interpretation of the 
dual distance between two image points: ф means the angle between the two 
lines and (provided Ф/ 0) Ф’ is their distance. Neither one is uniquely defined: 
the angle may be replaced by its supplement and the distance by its opposite

value. (For some problems it may be desirable to define ф and Ф' unambigu­
ously, for instance by 0< Ф с тг/2, ф’^0.)
We mention some special cases of (4.6). The image points of two parallel 
lines have no well-defined distance (cos(i£ + еФ’) =1, ф = 0, sin ф = 0, Ф' is 
arbitrary). If cos(^ + еФ') is real, but /1, the two lines intersect; if 
соь(ф 4- еФ') is a pure dual the two lines are orthogonal. The most important 
case is соь(ф + еФ’) = 0, i.e., xfx2 + У।У2 + ^^2 = 0: ’n this case the two lines 
intersect orthogonally and their image points are conjugate with respect to the 
quadratic form Q » x2 + y2 4- z2 = 0.
Example 22. Show that the vertices of a polar triangle of О arc the images of the three axes of a 
Cartesian frame in 3-space.
We can now give an interpretation of a straight line in the dual plane U. It is 
defined as the locus of points satisfying a homogeneous linear equation 
ux + vy 4- wz = 0, with dual coefficients, not all three pure duals. Each point 
on the line is a conjugate of the pole (u, v, w) of the line. Hence the points of a 
line are the images of those lines in three-space intersecting a fixed line 
orthogonally. These lines constitute a metrically special hyperbolic congru­
ence; we shall call the fixed line its basis. This implies that there exists a (1,1) 
correspondence between the lines in U and the finite lines in 3-space. A line 
(u, v, w) is the image of that basis which has the point (u, v, w) as its image.
Example 23. Consider the line x = 0 in U. It corresponds to the Ox-axis in 3-space. Points on the 
line arc the mappings of the hyperbolic congruence with Ox as its basis. Any point on the line 
may be given the (normalized) coordinates (0, sin Ф + ed cos Ф, cos ф - rd sin Ф), it is the mapping 
of the line q ж (0, sin i/*,cos
 <//), q' (0, d cos Ф, -d sin Ф) which intersects Ox orthogonally at 
(d.0,0) the angle with Oz being ф.
Two points L(xj, y,, f 1) and M(x2, y2, i2) have in general a join LM whose 
coordinates are
(4.7) 
yiz2-y2z,, f1x2~f2xb x,y2-x2yt,
but if the lines I and m corresponding to L and M are parallel, the numbers 
(4.7) are all three pure duals and they do not define a line in U. If LM exists it 
corresponds to a line in 3-space which is the basis of a hyperbolic congruence 
to which 1 and m belong. Hence the line LM corresponds to the common 
perpendicular of I and m. The operation of joining two points in U is 
translated in 3-space as the operation of determining the common perpen­
dicular of the corresponding lines in 3-space; each point on the join 
corresponds to a line which intersects the perpendicular orthogonally.

Example 24. Even if (x„ yb f () and (i2, y2, z,) are normalized coordinates the same does not hold 
for the coordinates (4.7) of their join. Show that this is only the case if L and M arc conjugate 
with respect to (1 (or. what is the same, if I and m are orthogonally intersecting lines).
Example 25. Two lines in U have in general a point of intersection. Determine its meaning in 
three-space.
Example 26. Apart from its application in kinematics the mapping may be used to prove 
geometrical theorems about lines in space. Let L, M. N be three non-collincar points of U. and L ' 
the pole with respect to Q of MN, etc. As is well-known the triangles LMN and L'M'N' are 
perspective: LL', MM', NN' are concurrent at a point H (or in the terminology of elliptic 
geometry: the heights of a triangle pass through one point, its orthocenter). The translation of this 
theorem in 3-space is the following. 1. m. n are three arbitrary lines. Г is the common 
perpendicular of m and n etc., (1Г) is the common perpendicular of I and Г. etc. Show that (11
*).
 
(mm') and (nn') have a common perpendicular. This is the theorem of Petersen-Morley. The 
configuration in space consists of ten lines, each being the common perpendicular of three others. 
The mapping on U is a Dcsargues configuration of ten points (and ten lines, it is self-dual).
A curve к in U is the locus of points satisfying an equation F(x, y.z) = 0, 
which can be written as F(x, y, z)+eF'(x, y, z, x', уz') = 0, which implies 
F = F' = 0. Since the two equations F = 0, F' = 0 correspond in 3-space to 
equations of two different line complexes, the curve к is the mapping of a 
congruence of lines.
F = 0 is a condition for the direction of the line, so that the first complex 
consists of lines intersecting a given curve in the plane at infinity; the second is 
of a more general character. An important example will be discussed in the 
next section.
Example 27. Consider the case where к is a straight line.
Example 28. Determine the congruence of lines corresponding to a circle in LJ. Let its equation 
be x2 + у2 - d 2z2 = 0. Derive the equations of the two complexes F « 0 and F' » 0. Show that the 
congruence determined by their intersection is degenerate: it consists of all lines in the plane at 
infinity, all lines through the isotropic points of the plane Oxy and a (2,2) congruence. Show that 
the latter is built up of »’ pencils of parallel lines.
Our mapping may be used to study spatial kinematics considering lines as 
the moving elements. The standard formulas for a displacement in 3-space are
(4.8) X = x cos0 - у sin ф, У = x sin ф + у cos<f>. Z = z + d.
From this it follows that the corresponding displacement formulas in U given 
by means of (4.3) and (4.4), are:
X = (cos ф + ed sin ф)х - (sin ф - ed cos ф)у 
= cos(<£ - ed)x - sin(</> - ed)y,

Y = (sin ф - ed cos ф)х + (cos ф + cd sin ф)у

(4.9) can be used to study two-positions theory in 3-space with emphasis on 
orthogonally intersecting lines.
Example 29. Show that in the elliptic dual plane U a birational quadratic relationship exists 
between a point and its join to the homologous point. Formulate what this means for 3-space. 
Show that a line in 3-space is in general the common perpendicular of two homologous lines.
In principle the mapping may be used to study «-positions theory in space 
as far as lines are concerned. For the case n = 3 we have introduced in 
Chapter IV the “screw triangle
*'
 consisting of the screw axes s23,s-n,Si2 and 
their common perpendiculars. This configuration is mapped on the vertices of 
a triangle and its sides. To study this configuration by more advanced 
methods, three-positions theory in elliptic geometry (Chapter XII, Section 4) 
is an appropriate tool.
In Chapter V, for n = 4 we have introduced the notion of a 
“complementary-screw quadrilateral’’ consisting of four screw axes and the 
normals between adjacent sides. This configuration is mapped on the vertices 
of a quadrilateral and its sides. This too could be studied by the methods of 
this section. In fact the screw cone (Chapter V, (3.3)), the cubic complex 
(Chapter V, (5.15)) and their ((9,3) congruence) intersection represent 
examples of configurations which we would obtain in U as F = 0, F' = 0, and к 
respectively. We shall, however, not develop the subject further. In the next 
section we restrict ourselves to instantaneous kinematics.
5. The instantaneous case
We have derived for plane elliptic kinematics (in Chapter XII, (4.13)) the 
formulas for instantaneous kinematics based on the introduction of canonical 
frames. Restricting ourselves to second order properties we found the 
following scheme
Xo = x, Xi = - toy, X2 = - «>2х - /3,y + /32z,
(5.1)
Yn=y, Yi = wx.
Y2= p,x - у,
Zo = z, Z| = 0, Z2 = - p2x, 
where to, P^ p2 are the (time-dependent) instantaneous invariants up to the 
second order.

On the other hand, again up to the second order, the pertinent develop­
ment for a moving line in space has been given in Chapter VI, (8.1):
Оi = q> - qit - i(qi - eqjt\ Q2 = q2 + q}t - \q2t\ (?3 = q,-

Qi- q l + К “ *?!  +
Here an, e(written instead of f to avoid confusion with the dual unit), g and A 
are the (time-independent) spatial instantaneous invariants up to the second 
order.
If in the set (5.2) we substitute the mapping formulas (4.2) we obtain after 
some algebra
Xo = x, X> = - (1 - га0)у, 
X2 = - (1 - 2eczo)x 4- eXy + e(l - e/i )£.
(5.3) 
Yo = y, 
Y, = (1 - еоъ)х, 
Y2 = - eAx - (1 - 2«r0)y,
Zo=z, Zi = 0, 
Z2 = - e(l - ед)х.
Comparing this with (5.1) we see that the canonical frame in three-space 
corresponds to an analogous canonical frame for the elliptic geometry of the 
dual plane U and that the respective instantaneous invariants are related:
(5.4) 
co = 1 - f<r0, /3)=~fA, 
= e(l - f/л).
Example 30. Obtain (5.3) by direct differentiation of (4.3). (Kirson [1975].)
We now consider some first order properties. The moving line 1 in 3-space 
describes a ruled surface R. The images in U of its generators are the points of 
a certain curve r. It is not identical with a general curve in U (defined by an 
equation F = 0 and corresponding to a congruence of lines) for the coordi­
nates of the points of r are functions of the time t and this parameter has only 
real values.
Related to a point L, the image of I, are two lines in U: the tangent t' and 
the normal n' of r at L. The first is the join of L and the consecutive point on r, 
the second passes through L and is perpendicular to f, it passes also through 
the pole O. The interpretation in 3-space comes to this: t' corresponds to the 
line t, the common perpendicular of 1 and the consecutive generator intersect­
ing 1 orthogonally at the striction point S of 1; the normal n' is the image of the 
line n, the common perpendicular of 1 and screw axis s, n also passes through 
S. The configuration consisting of s, I, n and t is given in Fig. 105. The plane

(1, t) is the tangent plane at S to R, n is the normal to R at S. The mapping 
confirms the first order properties we have found in Chapter VI.
Example 31. Show that the equation of t  is £iX + Y-(£ ’ + 
«0; determine the
*
normalized coordinates of t'; show that the Pliicker coordinates of t are quartic polynomials of 
those of I.
New results arise if we consider second order properties. In U the moving 
point L may pass through an inflection point of its path; this takes place if 
three consecutive positions of L are collinear. The locus of these points is the 
inflection curve. The corresponding situation in 3-space is that three consecu­
tive positions of a moving line 1 have a common perpendicular. The condition 
for three lines to have a common perpendicular is expressed by two 
equations. Hence we may expect a congruence of lines 1 with the said 
property, we will call it the inflection congruence. Obviously it is mapped on 
the inflection curve in U.
The equation of the inflection curve in the real elliptic plane is (Chapter 
XII, (4.14))

and by means of (5.4) it is in U:
(5.6) 
- e(l - eM)x(x2 + У2 + Л + (1" 2e<7oXx24- y2)f = 0.
Substituting in (5.6) the mapping expressions (4.2) and equaling to zero the 
real and the dual part of the left-hand side we obtain
(5.7) 
F= -e(q? + ql + qDqI + (qJ + q^qJ = 0,
F'= -e(- дф +

(5‘8) 
- 2ao(q? + q2)q> = 0.
Hence the inflection congruence C appears as the intersection of two cubic 
complexes, which is in general a (9,9) congruence, but in our special case it is 
degenerate. F contains only the coordinates q, which means that the lines in 
the plane Vo at infinity are triple lines; they are moreover double lines of (5.8); 
hence the intersection contains the line field Vo six times. Furthermore any 
line through an isotropic point (It or I2) of Oxy satisfies q2 4- q] = q23 = 0 and 
all these lines belong to both complexes. Hence C is essentially a (7,3) 
congruence.
If a line with direction numbers qx,q2,q3 passes through the point (x, y, z) 
then q'i = q2z - q3y, q2-q3x - qxz, q\= qxy - q2x. Substituting this in (5.8) 
we obtain

V'9' 
~ eq2(q2 + q2 + q2)z + eixq^q2, + q\ + q2,)- 2oo(<f ? + q2)q3 = 0.
Hence the lines of F' with a given direction lie in a plane. (5.7) implies that the 
lines of C intersect Vo at the points of a cubic curve K3. This implies that C is 
built up of pencils of parallel lines; the vertex of a pencil is a point of K3 and 
its plane is determined by (5.9).
An arbitrary plane W has three intersections SbS2, S3 with K3, each being 
the vertex of such a pencil. Hence in W there lie three lines of C, its 
intersections with the planes of the pencils associated with St (i = 1,2,3). This 
verifies that the class of C is indeed equal to three.
If in (5.9) we consider x, y, z as fixed, the equation represents the 
intersection with Vo of the cubic-complex cone with (x, y, z) as its vertex. This 
intersection is a cubic curve KJ in Vo, which has 9 points of intersection with 
K3, two of which are the isotropic points q? + q2 = q23 = 0. This verifies that the 
degree of C is indeed seven.

Example 36. Show that any finite line in space is orthogonally intersected by three lines of C.

Example 38. Compare the foregoing discussion and results with the finite positions case (i.e., 
three homologous lines with a common normal, Chapter V, Section 7).
Another second order concept in the dual plane U is the center of curvature 
M of the path of the moving point L; it may be defined as the intersection of 
two consecutive normals n'.
n' is the image of the normal n of the ruled surface R described by I, at the 
striction point S of I. Hence the point M is the mapping of a line m which can 
be defined as the common perpendicular of n and the consecutive normal. It 
intersects n at the striction point of n with respect to the ruled surface 
described by n; this surface is the counterpart of the evolute of the path in U.
The line m depends on the moving line 1 in a manner similar to the way the 
center of curvature of the path in U depends on the moving point L, it may be 
defined in more than one way independent of the mapping; it was first studied 
in spatial kinematics by Disteli [1914] and it has been named after him: the 
Disteli axis of 1.
In Chapter Xll (4.16a) we have given the coordinates of the center of 
curvature M of the point x, y, z for canonical frames:
(5.10) XM = /32x2, Ум = Д2ху, ZM = Pixz - ю2(х2 + у2).
Writing these expressions in terms of dual numbers, and using (5.4), these 
coordinates in U are seen to be
XM « ex[x + e(2x'~ дх)], YM = e[xy + e(xy' + x'y - дху)], 
(5.11) ZM = exz -(x2+y2) +e(-едхх + e(x'z + xz')- 2(xx'+ yy')
+ 2<r0(x2 + y2)).
To determine the line in 3-space corresponding to M the coordinates of the 
latter must be normalized. This can be done by multiplying (5.11) by a 
function of the form A + eB where A : В = Gi(x, y, z): G2(x, y, z, xу \ z'), 
and Gi and G2 are quartic polynomials of their arguments. From (4.2) it now 
follows that the coordinates (m„ m I) of the Disteli axis associated with the 
moving line (qhq\) are sextic polynomials of qhq\.

Example 42. Verify that m is perpendicular to the normal n; determine its angle with the moving 
line and with the screw axis s.
И in U the moving point L passes through an inflection point, the two 
consecutive normals intersect at the point M conjugate to the tangent of the 
path. The conclusion is: if a moving line belongs to the inflection congruence 
C then its Disteli axis coincides with the line t (through the striction point S, 
perpendicular to both 1 and the normal n).
The Disteli axis may also be discussed by means of the Euler-Savary 
equation in the elliptic plane, given in Chapter XII, (4.17b):

(cot p - cot pj)sin 7] = юг1р2-
In this formula p and pi are the distances from the origin to, respectively, the 
moving point and its center of curvature; r) is the angle to their ray from the 
pole tangent x = 0.
Applying this to the dual plane U the variables in (5.12) are interpreted as 
follows: p and p{ stand for, respectively, the dual distances OL and OM, 
for the dual angle between the pole tangent x = 0 and OL, and
u2/&2 = (1 - 2e<7o)/(c(1 - ep)) = [1 4- e(p - 2ao)]/e.
We note that the pole tangent x = 0, that is the line (1,0,0), corresponds in 
three-space to the Ox-axis.
We introduce in three-space a coordinate system for lines, similar to polar 
coordinates for points in U (Fig. 106). The striction point S is given the 
cylindrical coordinates ф. hy r \ the line 1 is determined by S and by the angle a. 
The Disteli axis m intersects S'S orthogonally and is determined by 
Ф. hy rb The dual distances p and pi from s to I and s to m respectively are 
a + er and «i + erx. Furthermore the dual angle 17 between Ox and S'S is 
Ф 4- eh.
From the trigonometry of dual angles
cot p = cot(a + er) = cot a - er/sin2 a,

cot pi = cot ai - erjsxn2

(5.14) deals only with the direction of I and m, it has the same simple form as 
the Euler-Savary equation in plane elliptic geometry. (5.15) is more compli­
cated; by means of (5.14) it may be simplified to
(5.16) (h/e)cot ф - [r(cot2a + 1)- fi(cot2aj + 1)] sin Ф = (p - 2<r0)/e.
If (besides ф and h) r and a are known then at follows from (5.14) and rt 
from (5.16). Inversely, if we start with n and ai they determine r and a. Hence 
there exists a birational relationship between 1 and m, which is, as we found 
before, of degree six in the coordinates of the two lines.
If in U the point L is on the pole tangent (which implies rj = 0) we have 
px = 0 for all p : the center of curvature of L coincides with the pole (as in the 
case in plane Euclidean kinematics). The corresponding theorem in three- 
space reads: the Disteli axis of each line intersecting Ox orthogonally

It is interesting to compare (5.16) with Chapter VI, (9.16). Clearly the 
Disteli axis of a line 1 is the same as the line, L, which to the second order is at 
a fixed distance and angle from I. This may seem surprising since the Disteli 
axis is associated with the ruled surface generated by I while lc is associated 
with a congruence which is defined by the motion of 1. It should also be noted 
that the striction axis defined in Chapter VI, Section 8 also coincides with the 
Disteli axis. (In fact, what we have called d in Chapter VI, (8.26) is exactly 
equal to r} in the present development.)
We restrict ourselves to these remarks on second order properties of 
moving lines in space. The mapping of lines on the points of the dual plane U 
enables one in principle to study higher order concepts. For instance, 
formulas for the curvature of the centrodes, in U, correspond to properties of 
the Disteli axes of the generators of the axodes.
6. Quaternions
There exists a species of algebra by means of which spatial kinematics and 
especially spherical kinematics may be treated in an elegant way.
A quaternion Q is defined as a complex number depending on four units 
l,i,/,k:
(6.1) 
Q = c0+ cti 4- c2j + c>k,
c, (i = 0,1,2,3) are real numbers called the components of Q. The addition of 
quaternions is defined by
Q + Q' = (c0 + cti + c2j + c3k) + (ci+ c'ii + c'J 4- cik)
= (Co 4- cj) 4- (Ci 4- cj)f 4- (c2 4- C2)j 4- (c3 4- c'y)k.
The multiplication of two quaternions is distributive with respect to summa­
tion and is defined by the following rules for the multiplication of the units:
li = H = i, 1/=/1 =/, lk=kl = k,
(6.3) t2 = /2=k2 = -1,
jk = — kj = i, ki = - ik = /, ij = - ji = k.
Hence
QQ' = (Co+Cii + c2/ 4-CjkXCo+cU 4-cJ/4-c;ic)
(6.4) 
= (CoCo “ C!C; - C2C2 - СзСч) 4- (CoC; 4- C,cj 4- C2cJ ~ C9d)i
4- (coci 4- C2CJ4- CjCi- C|Cj)/ + (CoCi + Сэс£ 4- C,C J - C2C i)fc.

APPLICATION TO SPHERICAL KINEMATICS

From (6.3) it follows that the multiplication is not commutative.
Example 45. Prove that the multiplication is associative: (QQ'X?" 3 Q(Q'Q’): hence QQ'Q" has 
an unambiguous meaning.
Example 46. 
Show that the system of quaternions, with respect to addition and multiplication is a 
skew field (also called a “division ring’)
’, contrary to the set of dual numbers it has no 
zero-divisors unequal to zero.
*
If (c0, Ci, c2, c3) is a quaternion Q the conjugate quaternion Q is defined by 
(c0, - Ci, - Cj, - Сз). From (6.4) it follows that QQ = QQ - cl + c\ + c} + c>, a 
non-negative number called the norm N(Q) of Q. If N(Q) = 1 then Q is called 
a и nit quaternion.
Example 47. Determine from (6.4) the conjugate of QQ' and show that it is equal to Q'Q.
Example 48. Determine from (6.4) the norm of QQ' and prove N(QQ') = N(Q)N(Q').
Example 49. Show Q’’ = N '(Q)Q.
Example 50. If Q is a unit quaternion then Q is a unit quaternion.
For a quaternion with c0 = 0 the components (cb c2, c3) may be considered 
as those of a Euclidean vector; such a quaternion is called a vector 
quaternion.
Example 51. Q is a vector quaternion if and only if Q + Q = 0.
Example 52. The vector corresponding to a unit vector quaternion is a unit vector.
Example 53. Two conjugate vector quaternions correspond to opposite vectors.
Any quaternion may be written formally as the sum of a real number and a 
vector
(6.5)
Q(c0, Cl, Ci, c,) = Co + c(c,, Cl, c,).
Example 54. The product of two vector quaternions Qx(0,e) and Q' = (0, c') is QQ'3 
-c •<' + c x e’.
Example 55. The product of two quaternions Q and Q' may be written
QQ e (co+ c)(fo+ c') = Cac'o- c •«' + coc' + cic + c x c*.
7. Application to spherical kinematics
Let a point in space be given in terms of position vector x = (xb x2, x3) and 
let x stand for the corresponding vector quaternion (0,Xi,x2,x3). Let Q be a 
unit quaternion (c0,Ci, c2,c3), Jc’®!. Then from (6.4)
(7.1)
<?X = [ ~ (C|X> + C1X1 + tfjXj), (cox, + c2Xj - CjX2), 
(c0Xi + СэХ1 - C,X1), (CoXj + C1X2 - C2Xi)].

SPECIAL MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN KINEMATICS
[CH. 13, §7
If we calculate QxQ, Q = (c0, - cb - c2, - c>), again by means of (6.4), it is 
seen that its first component vanishes which means that the product is a vector 
quaternion, we denote it as X = (0 ,Xb X2,X3). The result is
X, = (cj + c\- c22 - Cj)
*i
 + 2( - cocj + CiC2)x2 + 2(cqc2 + C|C3)x3, 
(7.2) X2 = 2(coC, + c2Ci)x, + (c J - cf + cl - cl)x2 + 2( - coc> 4- c2c3)x3,
X3 = 2( - CoC2 + C3C|)Xj + 2(c0Ci 4- C3C2)x2 + (Co - c J - cl 4- c J)x3.
These formulas are seen to be identical with those of Chapter VI, (2.1). The 
conclusion is: the operation QxQ on the point x, Q being a unit quaternion, 
transforming x into the point X, is a displacement in space, leaving the origin 
invariant; the components of Q are the Euler parameters of the displacement.
In order to prove directly that R = QxQ represents a displacement we 
remark that in view of Example 47 we have R = QxQ; hence R + R = 
QxQ 4- QxQ = Q(x 4- x)Q, which is equal to zero because x 4- i = 0. Hence 
QxQ is a vector quaternion (which we call X). Furthermore N(X) = N(QxQ) = 
N(Q)N(x)N(Q), in view of Example 48. But N(Q) - N(Q) = 1 and therefore 
N(X) = N(x) or Xi4- X2 4- Xj = x? 4- xl 4- xl which concludes the proof.
We have now derived a (1,1) relationship between spherical displacements 
and unit quaternions. Let D> and D2 be two rotations about the origin, and 
Qi,Q2 the corresponding unit quaternions. If the point (xbx2, x3) is displaced 
by Dj into (у,, y2, y3) and the latter by D2 into (zb z2,z3), we have
(7.3) 
у = QixQb z = Q2yQ2,
and therefore
(7.4) z = QzQixQiQi = Q3xQ3, Q3 = Q?Qi, Q3 = QiQ?-
Hence the resultant rotation D2D, corresponds to the quaternion which is the 
product, Q2Qb of the two corresponding unit quaternions.
The Euler parameters c( (i = 0,1,2,3) have a geometrical meaning and the 
same holds therefore for the components of the corresponding unit quater­
nion: Cj,c2, c3 are direction numbers of the rotation axis and c0 = cos Ф/2, Ф 
being the rotation angle.
Example 56. Show that X = QxQ implies x « QXQ; if Q corresponds to a displacement D then Q 
corresponds to the inverse displacement.
Example 57. Show that the corresponding quaternion of the standard rotation Xt • 
x(cos4> -x2sin^, X2 = XjSin^ + x2cos^, X,ж x5 is (cos ф/2,0,0,sin ф/2).
Example 58. Show that the rotation about the axis with direction angles a, fl. у and with the 
rotation angle Ф corresponds to the unit quaternion (cos Ф/2, cos a sin ф f2, 
cos 3 sin ф[2, cos у sin ф/2).

Example 59. Show that a vector quaternion corresponds to a half-turn.
Example 60. Determine by means of (6.4) the product DjDf of the two rotations given by

Quaternions are an elegant tool to describe spherical displacements. A 
certain school of kinematicians (Blaschke [1960], H. R. Muller [1962]) has 
developed this apparatus to study spherical motions (with one and with two 
parameters) from a mathematical viewpoint. However, for the main subjects 
of this book—n -positions theory, instantaneous kinematics, special 
motions—the method seems less useful. Moreover, if the components of Q 
must be taken into account one might as well make use of the Euler 
parameters and their geometrical interpretation. Therefore we restrict our­
selves here to some remarks on the velocity distribution: A spherical motion 
can obviously be described by
(7-5) 
X = Q(r)xQ(r),
the unit quaternion Q being a function of the scalar t. From this it follows (the 
ordinary rules for differentiation are valid for this kind of function)
X = 6xQ + QxQ,
or eliminating x by means of x = QXQ:
(7.6) 
X = QQX + XQQ.
If R stands for QQ then R = QQ; since QQ = 1 we have R + R = 0, which 
implies that R is a vector quaternion: R = (0, r). We obtain
(7.7) 
X = RX- XR,
or, in view of Example 54,
(7.8) 
X = 2r x X
which shows that 2r is equal to the angular velocity vector Л
Example 61. If Q e (c  Cj.C2.C3), Ec?- 1, determine R in terms of c, and 6.

terms of 1,(0), i » 1,2,3; determine the scalar angular velocity ш(0).

considering lines as the moving elements and making use of dual numbers, we 
derived a mapping of the general motions in space onto motions of the unit 
dual sphere (or elliptic motions in the dual plane). In this section we combine 
the two results in order to describe general displacement in space by means of 
(dual) quaternions.
A dual quaternion Q is defined as a quaternion whose components are dual 
numbers: c, = c< 4- ec'h i = 0,1,2,3, c, and c\ being real numbers. Q is a unit 
quaternion if Ec?=l, which implies Sc?=l, 2ctc'( = 0; Q is a vector 
quaternion if c0 = 0, hence c0 = ci = 0.
If x is a dual vector quaternion, Q the unit dual quaternion (c0, Ci,c2, c3), 
then following a procedure analogous to that in Section 7,
(8.1) 
X = QxQ
represents a spherical displacement of x onto the vector quaternion X; (8.1) is 
explicitly given by the formulas (7.2) if x„ Xt and ct are written instead of x„ X, 
and ch Here X and x are the mapping of the lines as given by (4.2), and our 
aim will be to determine c, in such a way that these formulas are identical with 
those expressed by the dual orthogonal matrix (4.4). Substituting into the 
latter from (7.2) so that the ati are in terms of the (real) Euler parameters c( 
we obtain nine equations, the first of which reads
cj + с? — c\- cj + c[2(coc3 + c2cx)dy- 2(- coc2 + c3Ci)d2] =
= (Co+ C2i- c2- C?) + 2c(coci + Cid - C2C2~ C3Cj),
which implies in view of
(8.2) 
£«>(),
(8.3) 
(coc3 + c2cx)dy + (coc2 - CyCx)d2 = 2(coci + c,c !)•
The two analogous equations are
(coCi + cyc2)dx + (coc3- cxc2)dy = 2(coci + c2cj),
(coc2 + cxc3)d2 + (c0Ci - c2c3)d, = 2(cocJ + сэс J).
(8.2), (8.3) and (8.4) are four linear equations for cl (i = 0,1,2,3), with the 
solutions
ci = J(c,d, + c2d2 + c5d3), c J = J( - codt - Cyd2 + c2d3), 
(8.5)
c2 = l(c3di— Cod2 — Cid3), ci = J( “ c2di + cxd2 — Cod3).

DUAL QUATERNIONS

We have obtained the following result: the general displacement in space with 
the rotational part determined by the Euler parameters c. (with Sc
*
 = 1) and 
with the origin of coordinates having the displacement vector (dt, d2, d3), may be 
written as (8.1). Q is the dual unit quaternion with components c, + ec'h where 
the c\ are given by (8.5).
Example 63. The formulas (8.5) have been derived by identifying only the diagonal elements of 
(4.4) and (7.2); show that this is sufficient to guarantee that two (direct) orthogonal matrices are 
identical; verify that the non-diagonal elements are also equal.
Example 64. Show that the dual unit quaternion Q corresponding to the standard spatial 
displacement (of a point (X|,xa,xs))
Xt = x,cos ф - xasin ф, Xa = x,sinфXjcos4>, X^-Xj+d,
has the components
|со$(ф/2) + Jed sin(4>/2),0,0, sin( ф/2) - \ed со$(ф/2)],
and therefore (8.1) yields (for a line)
Oi « q, cos ф - qasin Ф. Oi = q't совф - qjsin Ф + qtd sin ф + q2d cos ф. etc.
Example 65. Show that the (point) translation X^Xi + dj, X2- x2 + d3, X,« x3 + ds corre­
sponds (оф « (1, - Jedi, - Jrda. - Jed,), and therefore (8.1) yields Q, = qt, О J • d^q,- d>qa, etc.
Example 66. Show that the displacement, which is the resultant of the rotation with angle Ф 
about the line I (with direction angles a, p, у and passing through the origin) and the translation d 
along I. corresponds to the dual unit quaternion
Q =■ |со$(ф/2) + Jed 5т(ф/2),со5а(5т(ф/2)- Jed сов(ф/2)), 
cos p ($ш(ф/2) - kd сов(ф/2)), cos у ($т(ф/2) - kd со$(ф/2))].
Consider the special case where the rotational part is a half-turn.
Example 67. If the dual unit quaternion 0 e (co+ecA»Ci + ec'i,ca+ec|,c>+eci) is given, the 
rotational part of the corresponding displacement follows immediately from c, (i ■ 0,1,2,3); d, 
may be determined from (8.5). Show that we obtain dt a 2(c^ct - cic<>+ c|c>“ cJcj) and for da 
and di the values that follow by cyclic substitution of the indices.
Example 68. Verify that the dual parts c\ of the components of the dual unit quaternion Q are 
related to Study’s soma coordinates g, (Chapter VI, (2.2)), of the displacement corresponding to 
Q. by the equations ci® |g..
Example 69. The displacement corresponding to the dual unit quaternion Q = (<?», i2t is a 
rotation if c,d, + c,da + c,d, s 0. Prove by means of Example 67 that this condition is identical to 
ci«0.
Example 70. Two spatial displacements D( and Da correspond to the dual unit quaternions 
with components (£), and Qa with components (£). Show that the displacement D;
*D|
 is a 
rotation if S(c,Ci + c’.C.) = 0. Show that this condition is identical to equation (2.9) of Chapter 
VI, which is the expression for the condition that two Study soma’s have a point (and by 
implication a line) in common.
Example 71. Show that a general screw displacement can also be represented by a dual 
quaternion в such that 6 = i 1ап(ф/2) where i is the dual unit vector along the screw axis, and 
the dual angle Ф  ф ♦ ed (with its positive sense defined according to s using the right-hand- 
rule) specifies the rotation and translation along the screw axis. Show that an arbitrary screw x is

which is analogous to Chapter III, (12.10) (Dimentberg [1950, 1965]). Here, x is the ordinary 
vector cross product.
Example 72. 
Show that two successive screw displacements

(Dimentberg [1950, 1965].)
Example 73. If we use the dual quaternion operator (8.1) where
Q = cos(^/2) 4- s sin(4/2), Q = cos(<£/2) - s sin(4/2)
then the result of the previous example can be written more simply as Q,«<J2Q, where 
Q. =cos(^/2)4-j,sin(i./2) i = 1,2,3. (McAulay [1898], Yang [1963].)
It is possible to use the properties of quaternions and exponentials to 
advantage in obtaining expressions for the geometry between various screw 
axes. The Taylor expansion of a function of the dual number x = x + ex' is
f(x) = f(x + ex') = f(x ) + ex 'df(x )/dx.
Therefore e' may be written
e' = еж + ex'e1 = ex (1 + ex').
But we know = е<ж*' ж,= ежегж and so we have the identity
(8.6) 
(1 + cx') = e<
With the aid of (8.6) we may express a dual number x in exponential form
(8.7) 
x = x + ex’ - x(l + epx) - xc,p‘
where p„ = x’/x is called the pitch, which characterizes the dual number x.

The general finite displacement has been described in this book by 
equations of the form
p' = Ap + d, P = Ар + Д or P2=\Pi + d.
The particular form depended on which properties we were interested in 
discussing. We have already given the most common expressions for A and d. 
These are in terms of:
i) 
The screw parameters; using a special coordinate system (Chapter 1, 
(4.4)), and general ones (Chapter III, (12.9), (12.10), and (12.11)).
ii) 
Euler parameters (Chapter VI, (2.1)), including Cayley's formula 
(Chapter I, (5.7)) and Study's soma (Chapter VI, Section 2).
iii) 
Eulerian angles (Chapter VI, (3.1)).
iv) 
Dual quaternions (Section 8 of this chapter).
In regard to d: we point out that d always represents the displacement of 
the origin of coordinates and can always be given by (12.13) of Chapter III, 
regardless of the form of the elements of A.

In this section we briefly describe some additional expressions for the 
elements of A and d.
There is a modification of the Euler parameter formulation which uses the 
so-called Cayley-Klein parameters a, ft. y, 6. The Euler parameters can be 
replaced by the Cayley-Klein parameters by substituting into (2.1) of Chapter 
VI, 
(9.1) Co = (y + /3)/(2i), c, = (5 + a)/2, c2 = (6 - a)/(2i), c, = (y - 0)/2,

and in studying gyroscopic motions.

A modification of the Euler angle formulation which uses dual angles has 
been applied to the study of the kinematics of mechanical linkwork and 
gyroscopic systems (Yang [1969]). In this method we simply replace the 
angles in the Euler angle form of A (i.e., Chapter VI, (3.1)) by their dual 
equivalents. Hence ф -*  Ф, 0 —► 0, and £—•■£, where

similarly for P.
The transformation A represents the total screw displacement. Its form is 
exactly the same as in Chapter VI, (3.1) except now dual angles replace the 
ordinary ones. From this it follows that the displacement may be considered 
as the ordered product of three screw displacements Аэ,А2,А1 about screw 
axes fixed in X:
i) 
with A3, E is displaced using the Oz-axis as screw axis and (<Д, w) as 
screw parameters;
ii) under A2, E is then displaced about the Ox-axis using screw parameters 
(ft v);
iii) finally, under Аь E is (again) screwed about the Оz-axis using

Example 80. Using the results of Example 79 and referring to Fig. 107, show that (9.6) can be 
modelled in the following way. We introduce iwo fictitious systems E'.E" and then attach E to 
E' with a screw axis such that it coincides with o„ we attach E' to E" with a screw axis which 
coincides with the common normal between Oz and o, (in the sense from Oz toward of). and 
attach E” to 1 with a screw along Og.
It is useful to express u, v, w in terms of the displacement of a point in the 
moving system. If origins О (in Z) and о (in E) coincide before the 
displacement and if oXt oY, oz are the coordinates of о after the displacement 
it follows from the geometry (Fig. 107) of the three transformations (9.6) that

Hence if the six parameters (ox» oY, oz), (Ф. are known u, v, w follow from 
(9.7), and the elements of (9.6) are completely determined.
Example 81. Show that the d(l element of A is

The dual elements dit of A have the following physical interpretation: 
d4 =

Levi-Civita epsilon) atl are the direction cosines describing the orientation of 
E relative to 5, and ok are the coordinates of the origin of E in S. Which is to 
say the dual part is the ith component of the moment relative to 2 of the / th

There is an isomorphic correspondence between 3x3 real orthogonal 
matrices and 2x2 complex unitary matrices. This means any relation among 
matrices of one set is also satisfied by matrices of the other set. Hence 
complex 2x2 transformations can be defined which are analogous to our 
3 x 3*s.  We take p and P as respectively 
where i = V- 1. Using the Cayley-Klein parameters one defines the unitary 
matrix

with elements satisfying the auxiliary condition aS - py = 1. It is easy to 
verify that

and that

P = U’>U
yields the same result as (9.2).
Example 83. Show that if p is rotated to position P3 by Uw and then to position P> by Un the 
direct rotation to P3 will be given by using in (9.8) where U(Js Uu(Js.
Example 84. Show that the equivalent complex 2x2 matrix in terms of the Euler angles is the 
result of the following product
U =

and that if the Euler angles are replaced by their dual-angle equivalents the result is the same as 
from (9.6).

If we use exponentials it is possible to describe general spatial displace­
ments in a rather efficient way (OzgGren [1976]). We use the components 
(sx,sY, sz) of the unit vector s parallel to the screw to define the matrices
and
Then, clearly, the following vector and matrix operations can be equated 
s x (P, - So) = S(P, - So), f (s • (P, - So)) = U(P> - So),
and so we can write for the vector transformation equation (12.9) of Chapter 
III, the matrix form
(9.9) 
P2 = [I cos ф 4- S sin ф + U( 1 - cos <£)](Pj - So) + Do,
where S0(S0x, SOy, SOz) is the position vector of a point on the screw axis, d is
the translation,
Do =
SOx + dsx
Soy + dsy
So; + dsz
and I is the unit identity matrix.
We note (9.9) has the following form
(9.10) 
P2 = F(s,4>)(P,-So)+Do.
Since Jx+Sy+Sz= 1, the following identities exist
(9.11) 
S2 = U-I; SU = US = 0.

Hence
(9.12) 
F(f, ф) = 14- Ssin ф + S2(l - cos ф),
from which a Taylor series expansion yields
(9.13) 
F(s, ф) = 14- $(ф - (1/3!)ф5 +■••) + S2((l/2!)ф2 - (1/4!)ф4 4- • • • ).
If we multiply S2 = <J- I by successive powers of S we get from (9.11)
s’ = - S, S4 = - S2, S5 = S, S6 = S2, S7 = - S , •.
Hence (9.12) can be written as
(9.14) 
F(s, ф) = I + (8ф) + (1/2!)(S</>)2 + (1/3!)(S<J>)’ 4- (1 /4?)(S<#>)4 + • • •.
But this is nothing more than the Taylor series expansion of e5*,  hence
(9.15) 
F(s,4>) = est
which is very similar in form to the planar rotation operator e*
Example 85. 
Show that for a series of rotations ф„ i » 1.2>«

The result is that the general spatial displacement can be written as 
(9.16) 
‘ P2 = es*(P 1-So)4-D0.
It has recently become fashionable to use 4x4 matrices in describing 
spatial displacements. In doing this the position vector is described in 
homogeneous coordinates and the fourth coordinate is usually taken as unity.

represents the total transformation with A being 3x3 and d being 3x1. The 
value of d is always
d = (A-I)(-S0)+ds.
In terms of an arbitrary point jR, not necessarily on the screw axis, it is of 
course d = R2 - &R}.
Example 88. 
A very’ useful form of the 4x4 is due to Hartenberg and Denavit [1964) who 
have used it to solve 3-dimensional linkage analysis problems. Show that its elements

can be obtained from (9.6) if we set Ф * w « 0, and v « а, и = s, 0 ~ а, f - 0.
Example 89. 
From the foregoing it follows that the Hartenberg and Denavit matrix is the product 
of two screw displacements. Show that this same result follows from Chapter III, (12.11) if we 
take the first screw as S(eu-> (i.e., i(l,0,0), So(0,0,0), 0 = a, d = (a.0,0)) and the second as S(C1> 
(i.e., 1(0,0,1). Se(0,0,0), 0 - 0. d « (0,0, s)).
Example 90. 
Verify that the inverse of the 4 x 4 transformation matrix given in (9.17) is obtained by replac­
ing A by its transpose. AT. and d by the column vector -Ard.
Although we have given some of the most useful forms, there are of course 
many other possible forms for the spatial displacement.
We end this discussion by pointing out that the displacement equations for 
lines and planes can also be written in terms of the matrices A and d. If the 
point with coordinate matrix p is displaced into:
P = \p + d,
then a line with Pliicker vectors q, q' (in column matrix form) is displaced into: 
where <“pxfand
dj, d2, d3 are the components of d. A plane with coordinates uit i = 1,2,3,4, is 
displaced into:

THEORETICAL KINEMATICS
O.BottemaandB.Roth
“. . . a summary of obviously extensive and thorough effort . . . very well 
written . . "—Applied Mechanics Reviews
Considered the first work in English dedicated solely to theoretical kinematics, this 
book has won an outstanding reputation among workers in the field. The treatment 
is rigorous and elegant, focusing on the mathematical development of the subject 
apart from any particular applications. The authors begin with general concepts 
and problems and then specialize gradually to more simple cases.
The book is divided into 13 chapters. The first two deal with displacements and 
motion in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The next three chapters discuss two-, 
three-, and four-and-more position theory for both finite and infinitesimal 
displacements. This is followed by a series of chapters on kinematics itself 
beginning with a chapter on continuous motion. The next three chapters then 
discuss spherical kinematics, plane kinematics, and special motions, respectively. 
The book concludes with chapters on n-parameter motions, non-Euclidean 
kinematics, and mathematical methods useful in kinematics theory. Over 800 
examples and an extensive bibliography further enhance the usefulness of the text.
Because of its generality and lucid style, this classic work will be invaluable not only 
to specialists in kinematics but also to those with mathematical training working in 
biomechanics, computer-aided design, geology, multi-body dynamics, robotics, or 
any field where rigid body motions need to be understood or modeled analytically. 
It is a standard reference that belongs in the library of anyone whose work includes 
subject matter of kinematic content.
. . in its thoughtfulness, elegance, balance, rigor, kinematic insight, and encyclo­
pedic nature, it is in my judgment the finest treatment of theoretical kinematics 
which has yet been written.”— American Scientist
