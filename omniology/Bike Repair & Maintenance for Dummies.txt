About the Authors
Dennis Bailey: Dennis Bailey has been actively involved in bike repair and 
maintenance for over 18 years. He has worked on bikes on biking tours in 
the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Dennis brings a perspective on 
how to maintain and repair bikes, not just from within the comfort of a well-
stocked bike shop or garage, but from the side of the road, where, on many 
occasions, he’s had to put on his MacGyver hat and improvise with what-
ever grab bag of supplies were available at the time. You can contact him at 
mail@dennisbailey.com.
Keith Gates: Keith Gates started as a bicycle mechanic in 1977 when he 
was in high school. In 1982, after going to college, he got married and went 
back into the bicycle business as the Service Manager for A-1 Cycling in  
Manassas, Virginia. He became a partner in the business in 1984 and, in 
1992, took advantage of an opportunity to buy out his partners. He has been 
the sole owner of A-1 Cycling since then, providing personalized service 
and expertise to local bike enthusiasts of all ages. You can contact him at 
keith@a1cycling.com.

Bike Repair & Maintenance For Dummies

Introduction
W
elcome to Bike Repair & Maintenance For Dummies, where the often 
confusing and complex world of caring for your bike just got a whole 
lot easier. We’ve written this book to tell you not only what your bike needs 
to stay in great condition but also how to take care of the repair and main-
tenance yourself. It doesn’t matter if you’re planning to work on your kid’s 
single-speed bike or overhaul an expensive road bike, the same repair and 
maintenance principles found in this book apply.
Maybe you picked up this book because you’re planning on making biking a 
larger part of your life. With the price of gasoline these days and the health 
benefits from exercise, riding your bike makes a lot of sense. Or maybe after 
biking for a number of years, you’ve decided that your trusty two-wheeled 
companion could use a little better care. Good idea. You don’t want a wheel 
or something coming off the next time you round a tight curve. Whatever the 
case, if you’re interested in attending to the health of your bike and you want 
a simple and easy-to-understand guide to do it, you’ve found the right book.
Yes, working on bikes can be challenging — but it doesn’t have to be. A lot of 
books written on the topic are thick, technical manuals written by hard-core 
bikers for hard-core bikers. Peel away the jargon and the arcane discussions 
and you’re left with some basic procedures that anyone with a little hand-eye 
coordination, the ability to follow simple directions, and a willingness to get a 
little grease under the nails can do.
About This Book
We know that many books on bike repair and maintenance are competing 
for your attention. But we offer the following compelling reasons why this 
book stands apart from the rest. If you’re still not convinced, we’re not above 
bribes and begging — but we’re confident we won’t have to go that far.
 
✓ It’s in plain English. This book is not another one of those dense 
tomes full of technical language that require a degree from a bike-
mechanic school to understand. Those are better left for when your only 
other source of entertainment is watching paint dry. In Bike Repair & 
Maintenance For Dummies, our goal is simple: If someone with zero bike 
knowledge can understand the concept, we’ve succeeded.

Bike Repair & Maintenance For Dummies 
 
 Dennis approaches bike maintenance and repair through the lens of a 
bike rider, having toured thousands of miles on three continents. Keith 
is a bike-shop owner who, over the years, has worked with thousands 
of customers, most of whom are not bike experts. Together we combine 
our biking knowledge with a penchant for communicating in everyday 
English to help you care for your bike.
 
✓ It’s a reference. You can read this book cover to cover if you want. But 
we know that you’re busy and that your goal is not to become a bike 
mechanic — at least not anytime soon. So you can also use this book as 
a reference guide — and we’ve written it with that goal in mind. You can 
pick it up whenever you’re having a specific issue with your bike and 
turn right to the section that explains how to handle it.
 
✓ It’s comprehensive. Just because this book is written in easy-to-under-
stand language without a lot of biking jargon doesn’t mean it’s not com-
prehensive. We cover every part of the bike and all the maintenance and 
repair procedures that you’ll likely ever need.
 
✓ It’s objective. We’re not trying to promote or sell bikes or a line of parts. 
Our goal is to make you as knowledgeable as possible so that you can 
repair the parts on your bike and, if needed, know how to replace them.
Conventions Used in This Book
Every book has its own conventions, and this one is no different. To make the 
most of the information we provide, keep your eye out of for these conventions:
 
✓ Terms we’re using for the first time are in italics. Plain-English explana-
tions or definitions of these terms are nearby, often in parentheses.
 
✓ When we give you steps to follow in a particular order, we number the 
steps and put the action part of each step in bold.
 
✓ Web addresses are in monofont. Note: When this book was printed, 
some Web addresses may have needed to break across two lines of text. 
If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra char-
acters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of 
these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, as 
though the line break doesn’t exist.
One last thing: We’re writing this book as a team, but when one of us has 
something to say, we use our first names (see the preceding section for an 
example of this convention in action).

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
You’re not on the hook to read the whole book. You can jump around to find 
the information you need, and leave it at that. You can also safely skip side-
bars (text in gray boxes) — sidebars are interesting, but they’re not essential 
to your understanding of the topic at hand. Finally, you can skip anything 
marked by a Technical Stuff icon (for more on icons, see “Icons Used in This 
Book,” later in this Introduction).
Foolish Assumptions
So that we could tailor this book to your needs, we made a few assumptions 
about you:
 
✓ You like to bike or are thinking about making biking a part of your life.
 
✓ You or a member of your family owns a bike and you’re interested in 
caring for and maintaining it.
 
✓ You’d like to find out how to do some of your own bike maintenance and 
repair so you won’t have to take your bike to the shop every time you 
have an issue or call someone for a ride if you break down on the side of 
the road.
 
✓ You have little or no experience in using tools on your bike.
 
✓ You may be a seasoned bike rider who wants some additional tips and 
tricks to keep your bike in top condition.
How This Book Is Organized
As soon as you look at the table of contents you’ll notice that the book is 
divided into five parts. Here’s what you can find in each of them.
Part I: Getting Started
Part I is your Bike Repair and Maintenance 101 class. Before you jump into 
chapters on working on your bike, you may want to take the time to get to 
know the names of the different bike parts and how they work together — 
you find all that information in this part. Here we also describe some basics 

4
Bike Repair & Maintenance For Dummies 
for setting up a bike shop at home. Then just to whet your appetite for repair 
and maintenance, we discuss how to handle breakdowns on the road and tell 
you which repairs are better handled by a professional.
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs
If bike repair is a new endeavor for you, the repairs in this part will probably 
be the ones you attempt first. Here we cover the more basic bike repairs 
that anyone with a little concentration and elbow grease (be prepared to get 
dirty!) can do. We fill you in on tires and tubes, including probably the most 
frequent bike repair, the flat tire; wheels and hubs and the mysterious art of 
wheel truing; freewheels and cassettes (we tell you how you can tell the dif-
ference between the two); saddles and seat posts, including how to get the 
most comfortable fit for your bike; everything you need to know about brakes 
to keep them in working order and guarantee a sure stop every time; and the 
chain and why this hard-working part of your bike deserves more respect 
and attention than it normally receives.
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: 
Advanced Bike Repairs
This is the part of the book where you earn your advanced degree in bike 
repair. These procedures are a little more advanced and some require spe-
cialized tools, but they’re still very doable. Here, we cover the frame and 
suspension, the pedal, the crankset, the bottom bracket, the steering system, 
and the shifting system.
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road
If your bike has treated you well, this is the part of the book where you learn 
how to return the favor. If you want to greatly extend the life of your bike, 
increase your riding comfort, and improve safety, performing maintenance 
on your bike is the way to go. In this part, we discuss preventive mainte-
nance, including how to perform a pre-ride inspection, how to care for your 
bike while you’re riding, and how to store your bike when you’re done for 
the season. We also tell you the regular maintenance you should perform on 
your bike, and we recommend setting up a schedule for monthly and annual 
maintenance.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
This is the part that all For Dummies book are known for — the cool lists 
of things in the back of the book. We’ve included a list of ten steps to take 
before you ride, ten ways to improve the fit of your bike, and ten things you 
can do to enhance comfort and increase performance when you ride.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll find icons in the margins that alert you to specific 
kinds of information. Here’s what each of the icons means:
 
Whenever we have a particularly useful suggestion that’ll save you time or 
money or just make your repair and maintenance a little easier, we flag it with 
this icon. (We wanted to flag this whole book with a big Tip icon, but our 
editor said no.)
 
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to memorize it — there 
won’t be a pop quiz Monday morning. But occasionally we do tell you some-
thing that’s important enough that you’ll want to commit it to memory. When 
we do, we mark it with this icon.
 
When you see this icon, listen up. Bikes are precisely engineered machines, 
and sometimes you need to perform a certain procedure in a particular way or 
with a specific tool — or risk danger to you or your bike. Heed these warnings 
where they appear to keep yourself — and your bike — out of trouble.
 
We love bikes, and sometimes we can’t help but share some information that’s 
especially technical but that you don’t really need to know. When we do, we 
mark it with this icon. If you’re the kind of person who likes knowing all the 
details, read these paragraphs. But if you’re more of a just-the-facts kind of a 
person, you can skip these paragraphs — no harm, no foul.
Where to Go from Here
This book is a reference, which means you can dive in wherever you want. 
If you’re brand-new to bikes and you don’t know your derailleur from your 
down tube, turn to Chapter 2. If you’re itching to set up your own workshop 
in your house or garage, head to Chapter 3. If your bike is riding fine and you

want to keep it that way, go to Chapter 16 and do a bike inspection so some 
part of your bike doesn’t fall off on your next ride. Use the table of contents 
and index to find the information you need.
Finally, send us an e-mail with some feedback or a photo showing us your

W
ithin the pages of this book, you find just about 
everything you need to help you care for your 
bike. But if you’re completely new to bike repair and you 
don’t know your derailleur from your drivetrain, this is 
the place to start. In this part, we identify each part of the 
bike for you and tell you how they work together. We 
show you how to set up space in your home to work on 
your bike, let you know which repairs are better left to the 
experts, and give you some basic steps to take if you 
break down on your next bike ride.

Channeling Your Inner 
Grease Monkey
In This Chapter
▶ Entering the world of bike repair and maintenance
▶ Caring for your bike before, during, and after you ride
▶ Making emergency, basic, and advanced repairs
▶ Performing monthly and annual maintenance
Just as you’d bring along a map if you were heading off for a trip on 
your bike into an unfamiliar area, you should have a roadmap for your 
venture into the world of bike repair and maintenance. The journey you’re 
about to take or have already started can be fulfilling and bring lifelong 
rewards as long as you have a guide to help you get where you’re going. 
We’ve written this book to be your guide — to take the mystery out of bike 
repair and maintenance.
In this chapter, we open up the roadmap and examine all the different routes 
that are possible when it comes to caring for your bike.
Starting down the Road of Bike 
Repair and Maintenance
When it comes to bike repair and maintenance, the starting point is knowing 
the various parts of a bike, their function, and how they work together (see 
Chapter 2). When you know the various parts of the bike, you know
 
✓ How bearings reduce friction when you ride
 
✓ How to tighten threads an appropriate amount
 
✓ Why cables for brakes are different than shifters

10
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ What combination of gears is best for your bike
 
✓ How springs drive derailleurs
 
✓ How to make sure a quick release wheel doesn’t become dangerous
When you’ve figured out all the parts of your bike and how they work 
together, you’re ready to get started on your journey. But wait! First you 
need a shop where you can work (see Chapter 3). Working on a bike doesn’t 
require a lot of space, but it helps to have a location where you can operate 
comfortably. You’ll want enough space for tools, a drop cloth to protect the 
floor, good ventilation, and lighting.
 
If you’re serious about bike repair and maintenance think about two major 
additions to your shop:
 
✓ A workbench with a flat surface where you can work
 
✓ A bike stand that will hold your bike off the ground
Good news! You don’t have to run out to the store to start your tool set. 
Many of the tools you need are probably in your house. If you have a variety 
of wrenches, Allen wrenches (hex keys), screwdrivers, pliers, and a hammer, 
you’ll be able to perform a number of basic procedures on your bike. As you 
move into more advanced procedures, you’ll need some specialized tools.
 
You may want to wait to buy a specialized tool until you have to actually per-
form the procedure it’s used for. For example, you may need a crank extractor 
to remove a crank arm. Instead of running out to the store and buying a crank 
extractor right now, wait until you do your annual maintenance on your bike 
and actually need that tool.
When you do decide to purchase tools — such as a chain tool, chain whip, 
freewheel tool, or spoke wrench — you need to decide whether to buy them 
on the cheap or invest in a more expensive brand that will likely last longer 
than your bike. In Chapter 3, we give you some options.
Finally, to keep the moving parts of your bike in good working order, pur-
chase an all-purpose lubricating oil. Focus on lubricating your chain and 
the pivot points in places like the brakes and derailleurs. Having a cleaner 
around when you’re working on your bike is just as important. Look for an 
environmentally friendly product, such as a citrus degreaser.
Before, During, and After Your Ride
Bike repair and maintenance involves more than caring for your bike while 
you have it stowed away at home. It’s an ongoing process that’ll involve 
action before, during, and after your ride.

11
 Chapter 1: Channeling Your Inner Grease Monkey
Before you ride
The before-you-ride part of the trilogy deals mostly with the preventive main-
tenance steps you should take, which not only help your bike but increase 
the safety of each ride.
One of the best things you can do to improve your safety is to do a pre-ride 
inspection and maintenance check:
 
✓ Using a gauge, check that your tire pressure is equal to the recommended 
level on the tire’s sidewall. (See Chapter 6 for more information on tires.)
 
✓ Inspect the brake to make sure the pads are not worn and they tightly 
grip the wheel when you squeeze the brake levers. (See Chapter 8 for 
more on brakes.)
 
✓ Look and listen for looseness in the handlebars, headset, wheels, and 
other part. (See Chapter 16 for more information on inspecting your bike.)
Whether you have a brand-new bike or a 20-year-old clunker, things go wrong 
when you ride. Your best bet is to be prepared and bring a toolkit along with 
you to help you if you get into a jam. Here are some steps you should take to 
prepare your toolkit (see Chapter 4 for more information):
 
✓ Have a small tire pump mounted to your frame.
 
✓ Include everything you need to repair a flat, including a patch, glue, tire 
levers, and spare inner tube (in case you blow a tube).
 
✓ Include some hand tools, such as Allen wrenches, screwdrivers, a spoke 
wrench, and pliers. These will allow you to make adjustments as you ride.
 
✓ Pack away a rag to wipe the grease off your hands when you’re finished.
If you’re planning an extended trip, you’ll want to add some tools to your kit. 
These include a spare foldable tire, a chain tool, chain links and rivets, extra 
spokes, spare cables, lube, and the all-purpose MacGyver tool, duct tape. 
(See Chapter 4 for more information.)
While you’re preparing for a possible roadside emergency, don’t forget the 
following:
 
✓ Cellphone
 
✓ Identification
 
✓ Money
 
✓ Energy bars
 
✓ Rain jacket
 
✓ Sunglasses

Part I: Getting Started 
While you ride
Although you may not think about riding as a time for bike maintenance, 
there are things you can do while you ride to care for and maintain your bike. 
If you get into the habit of doing these things, you’ll extend the life of your 
bike and stay safer:
 
✓ Keep your tires properly inflated while you ride to improve rolling 
resistance and absorb shock.
 
✓ Pay attention to the road in front of you.
 
✓ Walk your bike over curbs and other objects.
 
✓ Raise yourself out of your seat and use your arms and legs like a horse 
jockey to absorb an impending blow.
 
✓ Shift into lower gears before you reach the steeper sections of inclines 
to put less strain on the chain and derailleurs.
 
✓ Look out for any creaks or loose parts on the bike before they’re in need 
of repair.
For more information on safe riding practices, turn to Chapter 16.
After you ride
The trilogy of maintenance activities is completed with the after-you-ride 
phase. Dirt acts as a major abrasive against your bike and, as it works its 
way into the internal parts, it starts wearing out bearings and other compo-
nents. After you ride is a great time to combat this enemy by washing your 
bike. Wet it down — but make sure you don’t spray water directly at the 
hubs or bottom bracket. Use a brush and soap to scrub down your bike. Use 
degreaser to break up any difficult-to-remove grease.
Remember to always lubricate your bike after drying it — particularly the 
chain, derailleurs, brakes, and cogs. When you’re finished, wipe off any 
excess grease so that it doesn’t attract additional dirt.
For more information on washing and lubricating your bike, turn to Chapter 16.
Making Repairs
If you’re lucky, you’ll never have to repair your bike anywhere but in the 
comfort of your own shop at home. But nobody’s that lucky. The fact is, if 
you ride long enough, sooner or later you’re going to break down on the side 
of the road and have to make a repair, like one of the following:

13
 Chapter 1: Channeling Your Inner Grease Monkey
 
✓ Fixing a flat tire: A flat tire is the most basic of emergency repairs (see 
Chapter 6).
 
 Practice patching a tire before you have to — that way, if you get a flat 
on the road, you’ll be able to fix it without stressing out.
 
✓ Dealing with your wheels: If you hit something with your wheel, the rim 
may bend or a spoke may break. You can repair both issues on the side 
of the road, depending on the severity of the damage (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Coping with the chain: Your chain may act up on you while you ride. 
In some cases, a chain may jump off the smallest chainring and become 
jammed between the chain stay and the chainring. Worse, the chain may 
even break. To fix the chain, you’ll need to have a chain tool and an extra 
link or two available, or else you’ll be walking home (see Chapter 10).
 
✓ Dealing with the derailleur: The fact that derailleurs stick off the side 
of your bike make them vulnerable to being hit or knocked as you ride, 
which may bend or damage them. Depending on the situation, you may 
need to adjust the derailleur, reposition it, or remove it (see Chapter 14).
 
Some repairs you won’t be able to make when you’re on the road — mainly 
because specialized tools are needed. These include a loose crank, loose 
pedals, problems with the bottom bracket, or a bent frame. If any of these hap-
pens while you’re on the road, your best bet is to call it a day, because riding 
could cause greater damage to your bike or lead to an accident.
Emergency repairs are the ones no one wants to deal with. Much more pref-
erable are all the repairs you can do in your shop at home. Some of these 
repairs are simpler to perform than others. If you’re new to bike maintenance 
and repair, try these basic repairs before attempting the more advanced ones:
 
✓ Repair flat tires. Flat tires are the main source of problems with tires 
and tubes, and you’ll have to learn how to remove a tire, find the punc-
ture in the tube, patch the leak, and reinstall it. After you’ve done it a 
few times, it’s pretty easy. (See Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Overhaul hubs. Central to maintaining your wheels in good working 
order is caring for the hubs. Overhauling them at least once a year will 
keep your wheels spinning smoothly. (See Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Change brake pads. Few things are more important than being able to 
stop on your bike when you need to. Learn how to adjust your brakes 
and changes the pads, and you’ll be in good shape. (See Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Adjust saddles and seat-post position: This is where you can make 
adjustments that your butt will thank you for. Choosing the right saddle 
and then adjusting it to the right fit will make riding a more enjoyable 
and comfortable experience. (See Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Replace chain. The hard-working chain is one of the most exposed parts 
of your bike and, as a result, it needs a lot of care. After it has given you 
a few thousand miles, you’ll need to replace it. (See Chapter 10.)

14
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Replace cassettes and freewheels. Over time, the teeth on the cogs of 
cassettes and freewheels will wear out causing your chain to skip gears. 
With a couple of tools and a little bit of effort, you can replace them 
yourself. (See Chapter 11.)
In reality, advanced repairs are not that advanced — they’re just a little more 
complicated than basic repairs. In some cases, you’ll need a specialized tool 
or two and you’ll have to be careful to follow the directions step by step. 
With a little concentration and determination, you too can be a hard-core 
grease monkey who knows how to handle just about any repair on your bike, 
including the following:
 
✓ Maintain the suspension. Although you’ll be limited to the kind of frame 
repairs you can perform, you can handle the maintenance and repair of 
suspension. In some cases, you’ll need to make an oil change or adjust 
the air pressure depending on what type of suspension you have. (See 
Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Overhaul the pedals, crankarms, and bottom bracket. The pedal, cran-
karms, and bottom bracket are part of the drivetrain of your bike and 
work to transfer force to the rear wheel. They absorb a lot of force and 
should be overhauled every year. You’ll need one or more specialized 
tools for this job. (See Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Adjust the shifting system. Most modern-day shifters are highly cali-
brated mechanisms that only require minor adjustments and main-
tenance. Most of your work supporting the shifting system will come 
from keeping the rear and front derailleurs in good working order. (See 
Chapter 14.)
 
✓ Overhaul the steering system. Handlebars, stem, and headset give you 
the smooth steering you expect of your bike. The bearings inside the 
headset take a pounding from the road so do this component a favor 
and adjust it frequently and overhaul it annually. (See Chapter 15.)
Even the most gung-ho grease monkeys should take some of the most difficult 
procedures to the pros at their local bike shop. Your local bike shop will have 
the expensive tools and, more important, the experience to handle these pro-
cedures properly. The following repairs should all be handled by a pro:
 
✓ Repairing frames: Frame repair is beyond the scope of what most people 
can accomplish at home. Some bike shops even recommend that you go 
to a frame specialist for many jobs or replace the frame altogether.
 
✓ Fitting a headset: Adjusting or overhauling a headset is an easy job that 
you can perform at home or on the road. But when you’re installing a 
new headset, it’s time to head to your local bike shop to leverage their 
experience and specialized tools.

15
 Chapter 1: Channeling Your Inner Grease Monkey
 
✓ Truing a wheel: Truing is complicated stuff. You need specialized tools 
(such as a truing stand, a spoke tension meter, and a dishing tool) and a 
lot of practice.
 
✓ Working on suspension: There are many different types of front and 
rear suspension and all repair work on them should be done either by 
the manufacturer, your local bicycle store, or a specialty bicycle suspen-
sion repair facility.
Performing Maintenance
In bike repair and maintenance you have two options:
 
✓ You can focus on the maintenance so that your bike will need fewer 
repairs.
 
✓ You can ignore maintenance and end up having to do more repair work.
We prefer the former. If you do, too, here are the maintenance activities you 
should be performing on a monthly and annual basis.
Monthly maintenance
 
Put your monthly maintenance on the calendar for the months you ride and it 
will soon become a habit and normal part of your life.
Here are the steps you’ll take during your monthly maintenance:
 
✓ Check for structural damage. Visually inspect your frame for signs of 
stress and structural damage, paying particular attention to areas where 
the frame is welded and hard-to-see sections such as the underside of 
frame tubes.
 
✓ Inspect the wheels and tires. Are they spinning straight? Are the tires 
worn, cut, or torn and are the spokes tight?
 
✓ Clean your bike. Dirt is your number-one enemy so if you don’t have the 
time to clean your bike after every ride, make sure you do it monthly, 
especially if you’ve been riding on a regular basis.
 
✓ Lubricate your bike. You take your car for an oil change every 3,000 
miles — make sure your bike gets a lube job every month that you ride 
to extend the life of its movable parts.

16
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Check for tightness. Even if they’re tightened properly, fasteners such 
as nuts and bolts have a way of working themselves loose over time. 
You don’t want something to fall off while you ride, which could be dan-
gerous or cause you to lose a part, so check to make sure everything is 
tight as a part of your monthly maintenance.
 
✓ Check the brakes. When a squirrel runs out in front of you is not the 
time to discover that your brake pads are worn out. Check the brake 
pads for wear, confirm that the cable clamp has the cable securely in 
place, and give your brake levers a firm squeeze to confirm that the 
brakes evenly and firmly grab the rim.
 
✓ Examine the chain, cogs, and chainrings. Don’t let your chain wear out 
because it’ll shorten the life of your chainrings and cogs. Measure the 
chain to confirm that 12 links measure 12 inches and, if not, replace the 
chain or soon you’ll be replacing the much more expensive cogs and 
chainrings.
 
✓ Protect your saddle. If you have a leather saddle, you’ll need to pay 
attention here. Leather saddles are great, but they require a little extra 
work, including a regular leather treatment to clean the leather and 
replenish the leather’s natural oils.
 
✓ Focus on your suspension. If you have suspension on your bike, inspect 
all suspension pivot and linkage bolts for correct tightness. If you have 
suspension forks, check your owner’s manual for instructions on how to 
care for them.
 
For more information on monthly maintenance, including instructions on how 
to do all these things, turn to Chapter 17.
Annual maintenance
Do you yearn to ride your bike in the middle of those cold winter months? Do 
the next best thing and become reacquainted with your bike by giving it an 
annual overhaul:
 
✓ Deep-clean the chain. Soak the chain in a environmentally safe 
degreaser to get a deep clean in between the links, rollers, and pins.
 
✓ True the wheels. All those bumps over the course of the year are going 
to affect the tension of your spokes and, as a result, your wheel align-
ment. Take the time to bring it back into true.
 
✓ Replace cables and the housing. Inspects your cables and the housing 
in which they run. If you notice any kinks, rusting, fraying, or a buildup 
of dirt and grime, it’s probably time to install new ones.

17
 Chapter 1: Channeling Your Inner Grease Monkey
 
✓ Overhaul the hubs. Overhauling the hubs annually is especially impor-
tant if you have traditional hubs with loose bearings. If you have sealed 
bearings, you probably can go a few years.
 
✓ Overhaul the headset. Yearly maintenance is a good time to inspect, 
clean, adjust, and overhaul the headset.
 
✓ Overhaul the pedals. Pedals are another component that utilizes bear-
ings. As with the hubs, if you want them to continue spinning smoothly, 
give them an overhaul.
 
✓ Overhaul the bottom bracket. The bottom bracket is the center of your 
drivetrain. All the revolutions of the bottom bracket add up over the 
course of a year, so do your bike a favor and overhaul or replace the 
bottom bracket.
 
✓ Clean the rear derailleur. The focus here is on removing the derailleur 
so that you can clean the dirt where it builds up most, on the two jockey 
wheels.
 
✓ Replace the brake pads. Keep an extra set at home. They’re cheap and 
easy to install, and when you install a fresh pair, they give you peace of 
mind.
 
✓ Replace the handlebar grips or tape. Need to add a little pizzazz to 
your bike after a long year of riding? Inject some color and life as well as 
some comfort for your hands by replacing the handlebar tape or grips.
 
✓ Wax the frame. If you take apart your bike for the annual overhaul, take 
advantage of easy access to a clean frame and give your bike a good 
waxing.
 
✓ Check your accessories. Don’t make the mistake of discovering that 
you’re missing an important accessory — like a patch kit, tool, or extra 
batteries for your light — when you have an emergency. Take a quick 
look at your accessories and confirm that everything is there.

Bike Physiology: Understanding 
How Your Bike Works
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the different parts of a bike
▶ Understanding the role bearings play in reducing friction
▶ Uncovering the importance of threads and how to protect them
▶ Discovering how cables control the bike
▶ Exploring how gears work and the supporting role of the derailleurs
▶ Finding out about quick-release hubs
▶ Identifying other bike parts
I
n this chapter, we lay the foundation for all the bike repair and mainte-
nance procedures that follow in this book. If you understand this chapter, 
not only will you be able to impress your buddies and the local bike-shop 
staff with your newly gleaned knowledge, but you’ll have greater insight into 
the inner workings of a bike, which is invaluable when you sit down, tool in 
hand, and begin to work on it.
If you really want to become self-sufficient in bike repair and maintenance, 
it’s not enough to know how to perform certain procedures. You need to 
have an understanding of the inner workings of a bike. Think of it this way: 
Cardiologists haven’t just studied the heart — they’ve learned how the entire 
body works. After all, the body is a complex set of interacting systems. To 
operate on the heart, a doctor has to understand interactions between the 
heart and the circulatory, nervous, and other systems.

20
Part I: Getting Started 
Now, we’re not saying that a bike is remotely comparable to a body in terms 
of complexity, but it does contain its own systems. If you understand how 
gears work, how bearings reduce friction, and how cables transfer power to 
breaks and derailleurs, you won’t just be a certifiable bike geek — you’ll have 
greater insight into how to maintain and repair your bike properly. If you 
have to change a cable, you’ll have more confidence performing the job if you 
understand how that cable interacts with the shifters, brake levers, derail-
leurs and brakes than if you see it in isolation. Awareness of how your bike 
functions may also serve you well when you’re broken down on the side of 
the road and trying to diagnose a problem or improvise a solution.
Although the bike is a mystery to many people, much of its technology and 
mechanics were engineered in the last century. Unlike your iPod, which will 
probably be outdated in six months, your trusty bike can last years and years 
and still perform as well as newer models. If you take care of your bike, you 
should be able to have many, many years together. But as with any relation-
ship, it takes hard work and effort. Take the time to learn a little bit about 
how your bike works, and you’ll be rewarded with many years of enjoyable 
time together.
Gross Anatomy: Identifying 
the Parts of a Bike
Figure 2-1 identifies the different parts of a road bike, and Figure 2-2 illus-
trates many of the same parts — and a few differences — on a mountain bike.
 
Not all bikes are the same, and some parts vary from bike to bike —road 
bikes are different from racing bikes, which are different from touring bikes 
and mountain bikes. A road bike has thin tires, light weight, and is built for 
smooth, pavement riding. Somewhat similar in appearance to a road bike is a 
racing bike; racing bikes are designed with expensive, lightweight materials 
and with a premium on aerodynamics (for example, with handlebars that are 
positioned lower than they are on a road bike). A mountain bike is easy to 
spot with its thick knobby tires, suspension, and heavy disk brakes to sup-
port riding on trails and rough terrain. A touring bike looks very similar to a 
road bike but usually has a wider wheelbase, a greater range of gears, and 
racks to carry pannier bags.
These two diagrams give you the basics on two of the most popular types of 
bikes, road and mountain bikes; for information specific to your specific bike,

Getting Your Bearings
Of the three major forces which work against you as a cyclist — air resis-
tance, gravity, and friction — it’s friction that our tireless little friends the 
ball bearings are designed to overcome.
Bearings are one part of the bike that has changed little over the last century. 
In fact, the first use of bearings goes back thousands of years. Ever since the 
wheel was invented, humans have looked to bearings to help with the prob-
lem of friction from a moving part rubbing against a nonmoving part.
Bearings, like those shown in Figure 2-3, are hardened steel balls designed to 
reduce friction among the moving parts of a bike. When your wheel rotates 
smoothly around its axle, it’s the bearings that enable this to happen with 
minimum resistance and friction. Bearings are found in many parts of a bike 
including the wheel hubs, pedals, bottom bracket, and headset.
 
On some more expensive bikes, bearings are made of ceramic, which has a 
number of properties that improve the reduction of friction.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Bearings

bottom 
bracket.
 
Bearings are an amazing feat of engineering, designed with a precision to mil-
lionths of an inch. When examining them, you should see a smooth, rounded, 
and shiny surface. If the bearings are dull or chipped with tiny divots, they 
need to be replaced.
Although it would appear that the round shape of bearings is all that’s required 
to reduce friction, the fact is that bearings still require significant lubrication 
for reliable performance. In many cases, bearings inside the parts of your bike 
are packed in water-resistant grease specially designed for bearings.

24
Part I: Getting Started 
 
If you perform a procedure that requires bearings to be installed, make sure 
the parts are clean before you pack the bearings in grease. Grease can become 
contaminated with grit and break down over time.
You may wonder how these little metal balls are kept in place. They’re 
secured with something called a race. A tried-and-true race design, still 
popular after more than a century, is the cone-and-cup. In this design, a ring 
of bearings sits in a cup and is secured in place by a cone, which is screwed 
onto an axle or spindle.
 
The cone is typically adjusted to be tight enough so that there is no side-to-
side looseness and the part (that is, the hub) rotates smoothly. Over-
tightening could cause unnecessary force to be applied against the ball 
bearings, leading to wear and tear — not to mention the fact that it could 
make it much harder to pedal.
Bearings will either be in a “cage” or retainer ring, or be set as independent 
“loose” bearings. (Also, retainers are typical for all bearings on a bike, and 
perform inferiorly to loose bearings. The only benefit they have is conve-
nience in building the bike).
 
One of the modern advances in bikes is the use of sealed bearing cartridges, 
which eliminate the need for adjustment or lubrication (less work for you!) 
and prevent grit and other contaminants from entering. Buy a bike with car-
tridges and you’ll save yourself the hassle of playing with tubes of grease and 
chasing bearings across your bike-shop floor.
Your inner gear geek may be disappointed if you use cartridges, because 
bearings are cool, shiny little balls that are fun to work with. Dennis feels 
like he hasn’t really worked on a bike until he’s juggled a few bearings in his 
hands and packed them in some fresh grease. But even so, cartridges do 
require less work.
Don’t Screw This Up: The 
Threading System
If you’re like most people, you probably think you know the basics of how 
threads work, but we promise you’ll be surprised by how much science there 
is to the basic concept behind a nut and bolt.
Why is this important? Of all the activities you’ll perform while working on 
a bike, tightening and loosening threads on a bike is at the top of the list. 
Improperly handle something as seemingly innocuous as a nut or a bolt, and 
you could irreversibly damage the threads of an expensive component on 
your bike.

25
 Chapter 2: Bike Physiology: Understanding How Your Bike Works
Threaded fasteners are the unsung heroes of the biking world. Although they’re 
essential to keeping your bike together as it rolls on down the road, they’re 
so inconspicuous that people rarely notice them. About the only time they 
come to your attention is when something on your bike starts making a rattling 
sound, usually due to a fastener being loose.
Fasteners are heterosexual partners. They consist of a male part (such as a 
bolt) and hollowed female part (such as a nut), as shown in Figure 2-4. Male 
and female parts, designed to work together, are cut with complementary 
matching grooves that allow them to be threaded together.
Different fasteners are designed to handle different amounts of force. The 
bolt used to hold the water-bottle cage in place would not provide enough 
force to secure a crank.

Tightening enough, but not too much
 
The one thing you need to know about fasteners — and never forget — is this:
Never over-tighten a fastener.
When Dennis learned this concept, it was like a revelation. He had always 
assumed that the rule was: The tighter, the better. If someone had shared 
this all-important rule with him earlier, he could’ve saved himself from ruin-
ing a number of fasteners.
 
Fasteners stretch and flex when tightened, which gives the joint force to stay 
in place. Over-tightening the fastener can cause it to stretch to such a degree 
that the joint becomes damaged.

26
Part I: Getting Started 
You don’t have to freak out the next time you have to tighten a nut or bolt. 
The general principle is to tighten it a bit, and then check it: If there’s still 
some play in the part, tighten it a little more.
 
If we’ve made you paranoid about over-tightening, you can always purchase a 
torque wrench. Bike mechanics use these in order to apply exactly the right 
amount of force when tightening a fastener.
If you’ve made like the Incredible Hulk and ended up damaging a thread, the 
folks at your local bike shop may be able to recut it using a tool called a tap. 
Of course, this assumes that the damage to the thread was minor and that 
there’s still enough undamaged thread remaining. If not, the thread may be 
irreversibly damaged.
 
Clean and lubricate all threads before tightening them. For smaller fasteners, a 
liquid lubricant will do the job. For thicker fasteners (such as the thread of a 
bottom bracket), a heavier lubricant such as grease is recommended.
When fasteners come loose
Sometimes a fastener will come loose. In many cases, this is the result of not 
being tightened properly. (Normally, vibration is not enough to overcome the 
force of a properly secured fastener.)
To prevent threads from loosening, bike manufacturers sometimes use 
devices such as locknuts or special washers to help hold the thread in place. 
Washers are used to help distribute the pressure around the bolt’s nut or 
head. They also reduce friction as the nut and/or bolt is tightened.
 
To increase the chances that a fastener will stay in place once it’s tightened, 
use a thread-locking compound. When this compound is applied to a thread, it 
hardens and expands, helping to keep the joint secure.
Shopping for threaded fasteners
When you’re shopping for threaded parts, keep in mind that threads are classi-
fied in a number of ways. One is according to the diameter from one side of the 
thread to the other. Threads are also measured based on how many threads 
are contained within a fixed length. Usually you will see measurements such as 
1/2 inch x 20 tpi. The first number refers to the thread diameter, and the second 
number refers to the number of threads per inch. The important thing is not 
that you memorize what the two numbers mean but that you know that, if you 
have to buy a bolt, you’ll need to take a measurement like this when you go 

27
 Chapter 2: Bike Physiology: Understanding How Your Bike Works
shopping. If you have a bolt in hand and need to buy another one, take it to 
your local bike shop. Just by eyeing the threads, the bike-shop staff will be able 
to help you.
 
For bolts, you commonly see an M before the measurement to represent milli-
meters. For example, the M5 bolt of a water-bottle cage is a 5mm bolt.
 
It’s not as important to know what the numbers describing a thread mean as it 
is to make sure the measurements of the old and new fastener match.
Considering How Cables Control a Bike
Despite the important role of bike cables, they rarely get the respect they 
deserve. They usually play second fiddle to their sexier companions, the 
shifters, brake levers, derailleurs, and brakes. The truth is, improperly 
installed or worn-out cables can prevent even the best derailleurs and brakes 
from functioning properly. When a squirrel jumps out in front of you while 
you’re hurtling down a hill on your bike, you’re not only counting on your 
brakes to grip the wheels and slow you down, but you’re depending on your 
cables to transfer the force from your clenching grip to the brakes.
Although cables have long been used to transfer force when pulled, bike 
cables are unique in that they have to transfer force around the curves and 
corners of a bike. The design of the cable with an inner wire supported by a 
stiff outer housing made of steel and covered plastic makes this possible.
Most bike cable housings have a liner made of plastic, nylon, or Teflon. This 
liner sits between the wire and the housing to help reduce friction. In older 
cables, wires didn’t have such a liner; because they came into contact with 
the housing, they required grease for lubrication.
In order to save weight and reduce the amount of friction, many bikes are 
designed to use cables with the inner wire exposed. The cable housing runs 
along a portion of the frame until it comes to a stop. The cable housing is fed 
into the narrow opening in the stop, which allows only the inner wire to pass 
through. To ensure a snug fit in the stop, a small metal cap, called a ferrule, 
usually covers the end of the housing. From here, the wire continues on until 
it comes to another stop, facing in the opposite direction, where the cable 
housing begins again.
Not just any cable housing can be used with a bike. For index gears, you use 
a different style, higher-quality, non-compressing cable housing. It’s made 
with separate wires running parallel inside the housing and is held together 
by plastic.

28
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Higher-quality cable housing for shifting shouldn’t be used for brakes, because 
it may not be able to handle the higher force applied during severe braking.
 
Less flexible non-compressing “gear” housing, though more expensive, is a dif-
ferent style and not necessarily higher quality. The only real benefit is that the 
index adjustment holds better than conventional housing. The failure rate of 
this housing is significant, and many people use brake housing for derailleurs 
anyway, although that usually means an additional adjustment to get the 
indexing correct.
The main consideration in the design of how cables work on a bike is elimi-
nating friction so that force can be consistently transferred to the brakes or 
derailleurs. Cables that are too long create unnecessary friction and lead to 
a soft or spongy response. Cables that are too short may create kinks in the 
housing or limit your ability to fully turn from one side to the other.
 
Setting cable housing to the right length is important. If you’re replacing cable 
housing, measure them against your original housing. Keep them a little longer 
than you think you need — you can always trim off some extra length. If you 
cut your own cable housing, use cable or diagonal cutters.
After cutting the cable housing, examine the ends to see if any burrs were 
created. If so, you can recut the cable housing or file them down. After cut-
ting the cable housing, you may have to open up the end of the housing with 
a tool, such as an awl.
If ferrules came with the cable package, attach them to the end of the cable 
housing. They protect and support the cable housing and help keep it in 
alignment with the stops.
 
You can buy cables in kits with inner wires, housing, and metal ferrules all 
included.
When running cables around a frame, you should try to avoid bends when 
possible. If you can’t avoid bends, make them as gradual as possible (as 
shown in Figure 2-5). If you’re replacing cables, use the cable path that was 
designed for the bike — an engineer took time to think this through.
For maintaining your cables, lubrication is useful to prevent rust. Use silicon, 
mineral oil, or a synthetic lubrication, and coat the cable before inserting 
it into the housing. Lubrication is also necessary for the parts that come in 
contact with the cables including adjusting barrels and anchor bolts, both of 
which have threads that need to be protected.
 
Don’t use grease to lubricate your cables — it creates too much friction and 
the dirt and dust from the road or trail will stick to the grease, causing even 
more problems.

Gearing Up
If your biking experience goes back as far as ours does, to when you climbed 
onto a tricycle for the first time and pedaled off to conquer the world, you may 
remember what it was like to ride with one gear. Cruising down the sidewalk at 
your parent’s side was pretty easy — at least until it started sloping uphill. You 
had to apply more and more force to keep your bike moving, until finally your 
little legs gave out and your parents had to turn around to head home.
Why was riding a tricycle uphill an impossible task? When a bicycle has no 
gears, each time you rotate the pedals, the rear wheel also rotates one turn. 
You rotation of your pedals will move your wheel one rotation (the full cir-
cumference of that wheel.) The force required to move that one rotation is 
much greater if you’re pedaling uphill. The idea behind gears is that the dis-
tance the wheel travels for each rotation of the pedals can be lengthened or 
shortened, allowing you to apply a consistent amount of force, regardless of 
whether you’re on an incline or decline.
Gears rely on the combination of the size of the front chainrings and the 
sprockets on the rear wheel of a bike. By switching between different sizes 
of chainrings and sprockets, gears allow you to use the same amount of 

30
Part I: Getting Started 
force when pedaling, regardless of the terrain. Most bikes have two or three 
chainrings with 22 to 52 teeth between the largest and smallest chainring. 
On the rear cluster of sprockets, they have 11 to 32 teeth. Based on where 
the chain sits on the chainrings and sprockets, the rotation of the pedals will 
cause the rear wheel to have a different number of rotations.
For example, if the chain sits on a chainring with 44 teeth and a sprocket 
with 11 teeth, the gear ratio is 4 (44 ÷ 11), which means that, for every rota-
tion of the chainring, the rear wheel will rotate 4 times. A higher ratio is ideal 
for going downhill or pedaling with the wind at your back. If the chain is on 
a chainring with 22 teeth and a sprocket with 32 teeth, the ratio is 0.69 (22 ÷ 
32). A low ratio such as this is needed for climbing up a steep hill. (Is your 
head spinning as fast as your gears yet?)
The total number of gears on a bike is calculated by multiplying the number 
of chainrings by the number of sprockets. If your bike has 3 chainrings and 
9 sprockets, you’re riding a 27-speed bike. On a bike with more gears, you’ll 
have a wider range of lower gears for going uphill and higher gears for going 
downhill. This also makes the changes in gear ratios much smaller, allowing 
you to more easily find a comfortable gear in which to pedal. Dennis’s tour-
ing bike has 27 gears and gives him great flexibility whether he’s huffing and 
puffing going up the side of a mountain or screaming down the other side at 
50 mph.
 
When you’re buying a bike, keep in mind the following gear tips:
 
✓ Choose a bike that has high enough gears to support faster speeds with-
out your legs spinning at an uncontrollably fast number of revolutions.
 
✓ Choose a bike that has low enough gears to enable you to climb hills.
 
Whenever possible, avoid gears that cause the chain to cross from the front to 
the back at an angle. For example, avoid locating the chain on the smallest 
chainring in the front and smallest cog in the back. This causes the chain to 
stretch and wear out and is bad for the sprockets.
Making Sure You Don’t Get Derailed
Anyone who has ridden a bike up a windy mountain pass or into a stiff head-
wind appreciates the ease of shifting into the appropriate gear with a click or 
twist of a shifter. The mechanism that makes shifting a nearly effortless activ-
ity is the derailleur.
To look at a derailleur, you’d think that it’s the most high-tech part of a bike. 
In reality, derailleurs are simple devices designed to move the chain between 
the different gears. Both the front and rear derailleurs are designed with a 

31
 Chapter 2: Bike Physiology: Understanding How Your Bike Works
cage through which the chain runs. When you change gears with your shifter, 
the derailleurs force the chain to one side or the other until the chain falls or 
is lifted onto the chainring or sprocket next to it.
The front derailleur consists of a cage that, in a side-to-side motion, moves 
the upper part of the chain — the part that transmits power to the rear 
wheel. Because the upper part of the chain is under the force of your pedal-
ing, it wants to stay in place. It’s more difficult to shift when you’re applying a 
lot of power and moving slowly.
Its more advanced partner, the rear derailleur, both pushes the chain from 
side to side and pulls it tight. The rear derailleur is designed to serve two 
main roles: moving the chain between the sprockets and keeping the chain 
under tension.
The mechanism controlling the rear derailleur is a hardened spring hidden 
inside. This spring is constantly pushing the derailleur away from the bike 
and toward the smallest sprocket. The cable attached to the bike’s shifter 
opposes the force of the spring. When the shifter pulls the cable, the cable 
overcomes the spring and moves the chain toward the bike and onto the next 
sprocket. When the shifter releases the cable, the derailleur again moves 
away from the bike. Tension of a second spring provides the resistance, 
which takes up any chain slack.
Rear derailleurs have a common design (see Figure 2-6). They have a cage 
that holds two pulleys in the familiar S-shape. The top pulley is the jockey 
pulley (also known as the upper jockey wheel); it guides the chain into what’s 
called the cage. The bottom pulley is the tension pulley (or lower jockey 
wheel); it’s designed to keep tension on the chain and take up slack.
Derailleurs are designed to maintain the appropriate amount of space 
between the jockey pulley and the rear sprockets as the derailleur moves 
back and forth. The derailleur also move its arm back and forth with each 
shift to keep its cage centered under the sprocket on which the chain sits. 
Usually, one or more screws are utilized to control the amount of lateral 
movement and spring tension.
The rear derailleur cage that connects the jockey pulley and the tension 
pulley has a length that varies depending on the amount of chain slack 
needed to be taken up. Models with longer cages are designed to support 
larger, lower-geared cogs and longer chains; they’re typically found on 
bikes with three chainrings. Rear derailleurs also have a maximum tooth 
capacity, which specifies the largest cog onto which it can shift a chain. 
Short cage derailleurs are found on racing bikes; they offer quicker shifting 
and higher ground clearance, the latter of which is important when corner-
ing in tight curves.

The Quickest Release in the West
On a cold day in the middle of a race in the Italian Alps in 1927, engineer and 
racer Tullio Campagnolo’s hands were so cold that he had trouble removing 
the wing nuts that held his wheel in place. This experience is supposedly 
what led him to invent the quick-release lever, something that has made lives 
easier for scores of bikers ever since.
Anyone who has ever had to remove a wheel on a bike without the benefit of 
a quick release knows just how much of a convenience Campagnolo’s contri-
bution has been. Whether you’re taking off a wheel to quickly change a flat 
or to throw your bike into the car, the quick-release mechanism is virtually 
indispensable to biking.
The basic design of the modern quick release (shown in Figure 2-7) still 
resembles the original. It’s made of a long rod with a lever-based cam mecha-
nism on one end and a serrated edged nut on the other. When the nut begins 
to tighten and the lever is lifted, the cam clamps down on the wheel hub.
 
Make sure to clamp the lever as snugly as you can. Do not rotate the lever like 
a wing nut — that’s what the quick release replaced, and you won’t be able to 
get it tight enough to secure the wheel.

33
 Chapter 2: Bike Physiology: Understanding How Your Bike Works
 
Figure 2-7: 
A quick

biker’s life 
much, much 
easier.
 
Working with quick releases takes a little practice, especially when you’re 
learning how to tighten the nut just enough so that there’s the right amount 
of play in the lever to enable it to tighten in the closed upright position.
 
Properly tightening quick-release hubs is important, because if they aren’t 
tight, they could come loose and the wheel could fall off. Today, most bicycles 
have front forks that utilize a secondary wheel-retention device to keep the 
wheel from disengaging if the quick release is incorrectly adjusted. Secondary 
retention devices fall into two basic categories:
 
✓ The clip-on type is a part that the manufacturer adds to the front wheel 
hub or front fork.
 
✓ The integral type is molded, cast, or machined into the outer faces of the 
front fork dropouts.
Ask the people at your local bike shop to explain the secondary retention 
device on your bike.
 
Secondary retention devices are not a substitute for correct quick-release 
adjustment.

Other Bike Parts to Keep in Mind
Earlier in this chapter, we cover important bike parts and how they work 
together as different systems to support the bike’s proper functioning. Here 
we want to take a moment to mention some other very critical bike parts or 
“systems” that are discussed in great detail in other chapters of this book:
 
✓ Drivetrain: Considered the transmission of a bike, the drivetrain is the 
system for transferring power from the rider’s legs to the rear wheel. It 
includes the pedals, cranks, bottom bracket, chain, chainrings, and cogs. 
(See Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Steering system: Consisting of the front fork, the handlebars, the stem, 
and the headset, the steering system enables you to balance and turn a 
bike. When you turn the handlebars, bearings within the headset allow 
the system to pivot within the frame’s head tube. (See Chapter 15.)
 
✓ Suspension: Although a bike will absorb a certain amount of shock as 
you ride, a bike with a suspension system improves riding comfort and 
handling in difficult terrains. There are a variety of suspension types 
including those built into the forks, the stem, the rear part of the frame, 
and the seat post. (See Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Brakes: Brakes (see Chapter 8) fall into one of three categories:
 
• Rim brakes have brake pads that rub against the wheel rim when 
the brakes levers are squeezed. A cable connects the brake lever 
to the brakes.
 
• Disk brakes operate on the hub. Heavier than rim brakes, they 
offer better performance in wet conditions. Some disk brakes use a 
hydraulic system, whereas others depend on cables.
 
• Hub brakes are similar to disk brakes except the brake pads are 
pushed outward against the inside of a cylindrical drum inside the 
hub. Included in this family are the good old coaster brakes.
 
✓ Wheels: Usually consisting of an aluminum or steel rim, connected to a 
hub by spokes, the wheel is connected to the frame by either a quick-
release mechanism or nuts threaded onto the axle. Some modern rims 
and wheels are made with carbon fiber and other high-tech materials. 
(See Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Frame: The frame is what holds everything together. In one way or 
another, all parts are connected to the frame. A frame consists of a top 
tube, down tube, seat tube, head tube, seat stays, and chain stays. The 
geometry of a frame is important, because it greatly impacts the han-
dling of a bike. Most issues with frames require professional care; in 
many cases, buying a new frame is easier than replacing a damaged one. 
(See Chapter 12.)

orking on your bike can be fun. In fact, you don’t know what fun is 
until you’re covered in more dirt and grime than your local auto 
mechanic and your significant other puts on gloves and changes clothes just 
to kiss you. Actually in most cases, the average bike-repair and -maintenance 
job won’t leave you looking like a grease monkey — and even if it does, 
there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction gained from fixing your own bike.
Even if the part-time role of bike mechanic isn’t your dream job, there are 
many benefits to doing your own work:
 
✓ You’ll be amazed at how much you’ll learn about how your bike works — 
things you never would have known just from riding it.
 
✓ You’ll discover tricks for maintaining your bike so that repairs are kept 
to a minimum.
 
✓ You’ll become so in tune with your bike that you’ll figure out ways to 
tweak it to give yourself a better ride.
 
✓ When you break down, you’ll be able to diagnose the problem quicker 
than Lance Armstrong can put on a yellow jersey.
Even if your goals for maintaining and repairing your bike are slightly less 
ambitious, you’ll always have one of the best excuses for getting out of 
household chores — you’re busy working on the family’s bikes.

36
Part I: Getting Started 
In this chapter, we fill you in on the tools you need to get started — and tell 
you about a few more tools useful for some advanced procedures. If you’re 
looking to take it to the next level, we explain how to set up your own bike 
workshop, which will be the envy of your neighbors — at least those who 
know that the Tour de France isn’t a trip through Bordeaux to sample the 
year’s Beaujolais.
To buy or not to buy
Buying bike tools is kind of like stocking your 
kitchen with cooking supplies. There are cer-
tain tools you’ll need no matter what. If you’re 
cooking, one of the tools you need is a spatula. 
But when you’re buying a spatula, you have lots 
of options. You can buy a cheap, plastic model, 
knowing that you’ll save some money — even 
though it may not be the most comfortable to 
hold and probably won’t last very long. Or you 
can invest a little in your purchase and buy a 
spatula that’s ergonomically designed for your 
hand and made of material guaranteed to last 
and covered by a long-term warranty.
The same is true for bike tools. A full spectrum 
of options is available, ranging from cheap, all-
purpose tools (which you can adapt for use on 
a bike) or custom-made, high-quality products 
designed specifically for working on bikes.
Obviously, cost is a major consideration when 
buying tools. A number of companies — includ-
ing Park Tool (www.parktool.com) and 
Pedro’s (www.pedros.com) — make high-
quality bike tools. They offer products made of 
durable materials that are comfortable to use 
and designed to work with high-end bicycle 
components. There’s something to be said for 
investing in quality tools that will last — not the 
least of which is impressing your buddies.
If you’re on a budget, however, you can buy 
many brand-name tools on the cheap from 
bike-tool manufacturers such as Spin Doctor, 
Performance, and the extremely inexpensive 
Chinese-made Lifu tools, which cost from $30 to 
$200. If you need basic tools like screwdrivers, 
wrenches, or pliers, you can find them in the 
hardware section of stores like Wal-Mart.
Keep in mind that working on a bike doesn’t 
mean going to the toolbox, grabbing whatever 
looks handy, and giving it a try. Although some 
of the tools that you may have in your house 
today will serve you in certain jobs (such as a 
screwdriver, adjustable wrench, and pliers), a 
number of bike parts require specialized tools. 
To find and purchase these tools, you can visit 
the manufacturers’ Web sites and see where 
the products are sold, or visit your local bike 
shop.
Some tools are designed for particular jobs 
that you may perform rarely or never at all. For 
example, if you plan on doing a yearly overhaul 
of the bottom bracket, you’ll need specialized 
tools that can’t be used for any other purpose. 
Most of the year, they’ll be sitting around in your 
workspace gathering dust.
If you join a local bike club, you’ll find lots of 
opportunities to borrow the tools you need, 
saving you from having to buy tools that you 
won’t get much regular use out of.
Start by acquiring a basic set of tools. At a later 
date, if your goals become more ambitious, you 
can always add tools as needed.

Tools of the Trade
If you were tired of eating out every night and decided to learn how to cook, 
you’d want to make sure your kitchen was stocked with all the necessary 
cooking supplies. The same applies to bike repair and maintenance. If you’re 
interested in taking care of your bike, you need some basic tools in order to 
be successful. If you’re really serious about becoming a gourmet chef of the 
biking world, and want to handle advanced repairs and maintenance, you’ll 
need to buy some additional tools. First, we start with the basics.
Assembling your bike-tool starter kit
If you’re looking for a basic set of tools to allow you to start caring for your 
bike, everything in this section is what I recommend. (See Figure 3-1 for an 
illustration.) You probably already have some of these tools in your house; 
other tools you’ll be able to buy with very little cost and from a variety of 
sources.
 
Buying tools in sets will save you money as compared to buying them individ-
ually. Buying a tool sets will also give you more options when it comes to 
working on different parts of your bike.
Wrenches
When working on a bike, you’ll find yourself grabbing wrenches a lot. You 
have many options when it comes to wrenches, including open-ended, box, 
and combination (see Figure 3-1).
Many people keep an adjustable crescent wrench (refer to Figure 3-1) around 
the house because of its flexibility; you can use one on a bike, although 
you’re better off using non-adjustable wrenches when possible, because they 
tend to fit more snugly to a nut or bolt. If an adjustable wrench slips while 
tightening or loosening, it could cause damage to a nut or bolt — not to men-
tion your knuckles.
When shopping for wrenches look for sizes 7mm to 17mm and every size in 
between to give you enough coverage for nuts and bolts on a bike.
 
Wrenches should fit securely over the bolt or nut before turning. If you aren’t 
sure which wrench to choose, select the wrench that fits the most tightly.

Figure 3-1: 
Wrenches 
come in 
many 
varieties.
 
Screwdrivers
What would a toolbox be without a trusty screwdriver or two? Both flathead 
and Phillips screwdrivers are necessary for working on a bike. You should 
have a range of sizes for the various screw heads found on a bike.
 
In general, the largest screwdriver that can fit a screw head is preferable.
Allen wrenches
Allen wrenches (also called hex keys) are the L-shaped tools used to tighten 
recessed bolts (see Figure 3-2). You use sizes 4, 5, and 6 the most.
 
Instead of buying a set of Allen wrenches, consider purchasing a mini folding 
tool — an indispensable and handy little tool that contains Allen wrenches 
and sometimes screwdrivers, wrenches, and other tools. It’s perfect for taking 
with you when you bike.
For Allen wrenches, sizes between 4 and 10 mm are usually sufficient.
 
An Allen wrench should be fully inserted into the socket before turning.

Hammer
Sometimes you need a hammer to tap part of a bike, such as when loosen-
ing a seat post or removing the pin that holds a crank. A small hammer or 
plastic mallet will ensure that you can control the blows while avoiding doing 
damage to your bike.
Pliers
Pliers come in handy for pulling cables, although they shouldn’t be used for 
cutting cables. If you plan to cut your own cables, use a cable cutter designed 
for this activity.
 
Never use pliers to loosen or tighten nuts and/or bolts — they’ll damage the 
edges.
Tire tools
If you ride your bike often enough, eventually you’ll need to work on your 
tires — whether that means keeping them properly inflated or repairing them 
when you get a flat. Here are all the tire tools you need:
 
✓ Pump (see Figure 3-3): If you haven’t already purchased one, you’ll 
want to buy a bike pump that matches your valves — either Presta or 
Schrader (see Chapter 6 for more on these types of valves). Some of the 
better-quality pumps will handle both types of valves.

40
Part I: Getting Started 
 
 If you have two or more bikes — with both types of valves — you can 
find a pump that is reversible, allowing you to switch back and forth 
between types of valves.
 
 Smaller pumps designed to fit on a bicycle frame are convenient for 
taking with you on trips — although, they require more pumping to fill 
a tire, because they’re designed only for emergency repairs on the road 
and not for routine maintenance inflations. Having a larger pump at 
home or even an air compressor will make pumping tires a breeze.
 
✓ Pressure gauge (see Figure 3-4): To take the guesswork out of filling 
your tires with air, you can use a pressure gauge. This will help you 
inflate tires to the proper pressure as indicated on the sidewalls.
 
 Many higher-quality pumps have a built in gauge. With the gauge on the 
pump, you won’t have to search for it at the bottom of your toolbox every 
time. Plus, you don’t have to go back and forth, between pumping and 
checking pressure.
 
✓ Patch kit: Sooner or later, you’ll have to patch a leak and unless you want 
to buy a new tube each time, you’ll want to keep a patch kit available at all 
times. A patch kid includes
 
• Patches
 
• An abrasive to rough up the surface of the tube to improve 
adhesiveness
 
• Glue

your tires.

eliminates 
all the 
guesswork.
 
 
✓ Tire levers (see Figure 3-5): Tire levers are usually made of stiff plastic 
and are used to pry a tire off a wheel rim. You’ll probably need three 
levers, although on some mountain bikes the tires are loose enough that 
one or two may suffice.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Tire levers.
 
Lubricants, cleaners, and degreasers
Lubricants, cleaners, and degreasers aren’t technically “tools,” but they’re 
essential to properly repairing and maintaining your bike. With so many 
moving parts causing friction, a bike requires proper lubrication — including 
specially designed oils and greases — to reduce this friction and help pre-
vent rust and corrosion.

42
Part I: Getting Started 
The same qualities that give oil and grease their lubricating properties and 
enable them to stick to external parts are also what attracts dirt and grime. 
This means that, unlike with your car’s internal parts, you can’t wait 3,000 
miles for an oil change. Regular care for your bike requires using cleaners to 
remove surface dirt and degreasers to cut through heaver grime that’s too 
strong for normal cleaners.
We cover lubricants, degreasers, and cleaners in the following sections.
Lubricants
If you’re an average rider, an all-purpose lubricating oil designed for bikes 
will be all that you need. You can use oil to lubricate pivot points such as 
brakes and derailleurs, as well as to keep the chain lubed.
Some riders use a lubrication specially designed for a chain. Manufacturers 
offer a number of quality lubes that are designed with different conditions in 
mind. A dry wax-based lube is best for dry, summer-like conditions. For the 
rainy season, a wet lube is the choice for many riders — although a wet lube 
is messy and attracts dirt and grime, it holds up well to water.
 
For a great description of use of chain lubes, see Urban Bikers’ Tricks & Tips, 
by Dave Glowacz (Wordspace Press).
 
Liquid lubricants can be applied from an aerosol can or a plastic squeeze 
bottle. We prefer to drip a lubricant out of a bottle because we can control 
the flow. Spray cans are much more difficult to control and can over-
lubricate parts.
When you need to loosen a seized part — such as a seat post that won’t 
budge — use a light, penetrating oil like WD-40.
 
WD-40 should not be used as a chain lubricant. Although WD-40 works won-
ders in getting tight parts moving again, it’s a solvent that will strip away exist-
ing lubrication. Although it may appear to be lubricating while it’s wet, as soon 
as it evaporates, your chain lubrication will be gone. Also keep WD-40 away 
from shifters, because it may damage the inner parts.
In addition to oil, grease is needed to support the internal moving parts of 
your bike, particularly those that depend on bearings to reduce friction. 
Bearings in the hubs, bottom brackets, headsets, and pedals are packed in 
grease. When these are overhauled, the grease needs to be replaced. Grease 
also protects the threads found on the same parts and lubricates and pre-
vents rust from forming on the gear and brake inner wires
 
Grease is often sold in a tube. Be sure to keep the lid on at all times to prevent 
contamination.

43
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Shop: Repairing Your Bike at Home
 
Buy only grease designed for bikes. Grease for automobile bearings will be too 
heavy and thick and will gum up your bike.
Cleaners and degreasers
The simplest way to clean a bike is to rinse it off with water after a ride. This 
will dislodge any loose dirt, sand, or grit lodged in the bike’s parts.
 
When washing your bike, use a light mist spray to avoid directing water into 
bearing areas, such as hubs or the bottom bracket, where it can break down 
bearing grease.
A mild soap (such as dish soap) will remove dirt and grime, although it won’t 
be strong enough to clean grease-laden parts such as the chain rings, cogs, 
and chains, as well as the insides of hubs, bottom brackets, and the headset.
 
Although solvents such as gasoline, kerosene, and paint thinner will cut 
grease and oil, we don’t recommended that you use them because they’re 
highly flammable, they emit toxic fumes, and they’re very harsh on your bike.
Commercially available degreasers are designed to not harm bike com-
ponents — or you. Many of them are biodegradable and environmentally 
friendly. Citrus-based degreasers are among our favorites — they’re made 
from oil extracted from orange peels. A number of green cleaners are also 
available — not only will they clean your bike, but they don’t give off the 
toxic fumes associated with typical solvents.
Specialized tools for advanced bike jobs
In a chef’s personal kitchen, some cooking tools (like knives or bowls) are 
multipurpose and can be used for a variety of recipes; other tools (like pastry 
bags or pasta machines) are very specialized. Unless those more special-
ized tools are in the kitchen of someone who makes pastries or pasta from 
scratch, they’re likely going to remain stored away most of the time.
The same is true of many specialized bike tools: They’re designed for specific 
procedures (such as extracting a crank or removing cogs), activities that 
you’ll either perform infrequently or leave to your local bike shop.
 
Companies like Park Tool sell hundreds of different types of these tools, many 
of which are designed to work with specific makes and models of bike com-
ponents. When shopping for a particular tool, make sure you identify the one 
that’s designed to work with your bike component. If you aren’t sure, your 
local bike shop will be able to advise you.
Here’s a list of specialized tools you may have a need for if you want to take 
your repairs up a notch:

44
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Chain tool (see Figure 3-6): If you plan on replacing or repairing a chain, 
you’ll need this tool. It’s used to break or connect a chain by pushing 
a pin through the chain links. Some chains, such as SRAM Master Link, 
do not require a chain tool to be removed and reinstalled. A chain tool 
is still needed for installing a new chain in order to cut it to the proper 
length.
 
Figure 3-6: 
A chain tool.
 
 
✓ Crank puller (see Figure 3-7): Many bikes require this special tool, 
which threads into the crank to pull it off the bottom bracket. In these 
situations, you’ll also require a socket set or a dedicated crank bolt tool 
(usually 14mm or 15mm).
 
Figure 3-7: A 
crank puller.
 
 
✓ Cone wrench (see Figure 3-8): You use a cone wrench if you’re going 
to overhaul or make an adjustment to the bearings of your wheel hub. 
There are a number of standard sizes (usually 13mm for the front and 
15mm for the rear), so be sure to check your wheel specifications. It’s 
good to have two of each size.
 
Figure 3-8: 
A cone 
wrench.
 

45
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Shop: Repairing Your Bike at Home
 
✓ Chain whip (see Figure 3-9): A chain whip is used to hold the cogs in 
place while removing a cassette. Two of these can be used together to 
remove individual cogs from a freewheel.
 
Figure 3-9: A 
chain whip.
 

46
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Freewheel tool (see Figure 3-10): A freewheel tool is required for remov-
ing the cassette from the rear hub. As always is the case with any spe-
cialized tool, be sure to buy one that fits your bike’s particular make of 
freewheel or cassette.
 
Figure 3-10: 
A freewheel 
tool.
 
 
✓ Bottom bracket tools (see Figure 3-11): Depending on the type of 
bottom bracket on your bike, you’ll need one or more tools. Review your 
owner’s manual or check with your local bike store to identify the manu-
facturer and model — this’ll determine what tools you need.

bracket 
tools you 
need vary 
depending 
on the bike 
you have.

 Chapter 3: Setting Up Shop: Repairing Your Bike at Home
 
✓ Headset tool (see Figure 3-12): To work on the headset, you need two 
large, flat, open-ended wrenches. These come in different sizes, so be 
sure to check the owner’s manual and buy ones the fit your headset.
 
Figure 3-12: 
A headset 
tool.
 
 
✓ Spoke wrench (see Figure 3-13): Also called a spoke key or nipple span-
ner, this wrench is used to tighten, remove, or install a spoke. Although 
spokes may all appear the same to an untrained eye, they require the 
right-size spoke wrench to prevent damage to the nipples.

Setting Up Shop
Working on a bike doesn’t require a lot of space, but it is convenient to have 
a location set aside in your house where you can comfortably organize your 
tools, handle individual bike parts, and have enough space to move around 
without bumping into anything. If you’re planning on doing your own bike 
repair and maintenance, you may want to start thinking about where to do it.
Considering how much space you need
Although it’d be nice to have an individual room in which to set up your own 
bike shop, most people don’t have that much extra space. Fortunately, you 
don’t need a large space. You just need an area that’s long enough and wide 
enough to hold your bike and possibly a workbench, with enough space in 
between that you can operate comfortably. Part of a basement or garage can 
be a solution, or even the corner of a room.
Factoring in ventilation
Look for a space with proper ventilation. Vapors from cleaners and degreasers 
can be irritating to some, so unless you want to be seeing colors and taking a 
ride on a magic carpet instead of a bike, you need access to plenty of fresh air.
Not all products are pleasing to the nose. Go to the back of the bike shop and 
you’ll know what we mean. If you do this work in a small unventilated area, 
you’re asking for problems.
 
The products that you’ll accumulate as a part of your bike shop should be 
used with caution. Be sure to
 
✓ Read and follow all warning labels both for tools and chemicals.
 
✓ Wear rubber gloves to protect your skin from chemicals.
 
✓ Wear safety glasses when cutting, grinding, or drilling.
 
✓ Use tools that are designed for your bike’s components. Forcing a tool 
that doesn’t quite fit a part could cause it to slip or break, which can 
cause injury.
When in doubt, consult with your owner’s manual or your local bike shop.

49
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Shop: Repairing Your Bike at Home
Looking into the light(ing)
Also pay attention to lighting. Extra lighting can be helpful so you don’t strain 
your eyes while working on small, intricate parts. A droplight hung from the 
ceiling will give you the ability to move the light as needed, to reach those 
poorly lit parts of your bike.
Wrangling a workbench
You’ll need a flat surface for many repair and maintenance procedures. You 
may need to lay out parts, cut a cable, or steady a hand when setting bearings. 
This is where a workbench comes in handy. In fact, what would a shop be with-
out a workbench? You wouldn’t have a kitchen with a counter, would you?
 
Look for a bench with enough flat space to lay out your tools and parts, and 
one that’s solid enough that if you need to strike something with a hammer or 
attach a vise, there’ll be enough support.
Because clutter can build up quickly, maintain some space under the work-
bench to stow away trash, rags, cleaning cloths, and spare parts. This will go 
a long way toward keeping your space organized and impressing your house-
mates enough that they’ll actually visit or bring you a drink once in a while.
Focusing on storage
To organize your tools, you’ll want either a toolbox (to put your tools in) or 
a pegboard (to hang your tools on). Most hardware stores supply long and 
short hooks that work with pegboards.
 
If you’re working with a pegboard, trace the outline of each tool onto the 
board with a marker, and you’ll always remember what goes where. This tech-
nique will also keep you from misplacing a tool and blaming it on the kids.
Banking on a bike stand
If you’re serious about doing your own bike repair and maintenance, and 
you’ve invested in the right tools for the job, you may want to think about 
buying a bike stand (see Figure 3-14).
Working on a bike when it’s suspended off the ground is much easier. You 
can raise, lower, and rotate the bike to get exactly the position you want. 
Plus, you’re not hunched down over your bike — your back will thank you for 
that when you’re finished.

50
Part I: Getting Started 
 
Figure 3-14: 
A bike stand 
makes the 
job of bike 
repair much 
easier.
 
A number of different types of bike stands are on the market. Prices range from 
under $100 to several hundred dollars. The best stands have adjustable heights 
and allow you to rotate the bike 360 degrees. Some are freestanding, while 
others attach to a wall or worktable (which can be useful in tight spaces). Some 
models are foldable for easy storage when you’re finished — useful if you’re 
short on space. In general, the more-expensive models have designs that pro-
vide greater stability, which is useful when applying leverage to your bike.
 
If you don’t have the money for a stand, you can get creative and suspend 
your bike with hooks connected to the ceiling. Although many jobs are much 
easier if your bike is immobilized by a stand, you can do most jobs with a 
suspended bike.
 
When clamping your bike to the bike stand, consult the owner’s manual for 
your bike. Most bikes can be clamped at the seat post or frame, but some bike 
manufacturers recommend that you avoid clamping or over-clamping the 
frame. This is especially true for carbon-fiber bikes, which should never be 
clamped in traditional stands.
 
Some bikes can be turned upside-down and supported by the handlebars 
and saddle. If you do this, be careful to move the shifters out of the way so 
that they aren’t damaged. The clamps that hold the shifters in place can be 
loosened with an Allen wrench and tightened when you return them to their 
original position.

51
 Chapter 3: Setting Up Shop: Repairing Your Bike at Home
 
Working on bikes can get pretty messy. You’re dealing with bottles of oil, 
tubes of grease, dirt, grime, and cleaning solutions. After some procedures, 
you’ll feel like someone should spray you off with a hose before you leave the 
shop. To protect your floor and to facilitate cleaning up afterward, always 
place a mat, dropcloth, or extra piece of carpet or flooring under your bike. 
You’ll be thankful you did.
Repair and maintenance tips
If you’ve just embarked on a journey of bike 
repair and maintenance, you’re on course for 
an adventure of learning, self-sufficiency, pride, 
and satisfaction. We want your journey to be 
full of enjoyment, not one that makes you want 
to pull your hair out with frustration. Follow 
these tips, and you can avoid lots of unneces-
sary problems:
 ✓ Take safety precautions when you work. 
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes 
and rubber gloves to cover your skin. 
(Gloves will also keep your hands clean. 
Trying to get dirt and grease off your hands 
and out from under your fingernails can 
be a chore.) If you’re using chemicals in 
an enclosed space, limit your exposure by 
wearing a mask and limiting your exposure 
time. Better yet, don’t use chemicals in an 
enclosed space, period. Make sure that you 
always work in an area with proper ventila-
tion.
 ✓ When you take something apart, note the 
order in which you dissembled it. This tip 
will save you all kinds of time when you try 
to reassemble it. You can scratch notes 
on a piece of paper or line up the parts in 
sequence on a flat surface.
 ✓ Before reassembling a component, thor-
oughly clean its parts. Also clean the part 
of the bike you removed it from.
 ✓ After you finish lubricating a part, wipe off 
any excess lubrication. This will help keep 
dirt and grime to a minimum.
 ✓ Be careful when tightening parts. Too much 
force and you could strip the threads. If you 
aren’t sure, under-tighten the part, check it, 
and if it’s loose, tighten it a little more.
 ✓ Never force a part that doesn’t want to 
cooperate. This advice is especially true 
for threads. Always check to see that the 
threads match, use grease on the threads, 
wait for the grease to penetrate the threads, 
and tighten slowly when you begin — to 
make sure you don’t cause any damage.
 ✓ When following the instructions in this 
book, keep in mind that many procedures 
may vary depending on the component, the 
bike, and the manufacturer. We give you 
guidelines for basic bike maintenance and 
repair, but you may need to tailor them to 
your individual bike. When in doubt, follow 
your bike owner’s manual.
 ✓ Don’t feel as though you have to do every-
thing yourself. If you aren’t sure about 
how something works, you’re better off 
taking the time to look for the answer in 
the owner’s manual or asking staff in your 
local bike shop. Otherwise, you could end 
up damaging your bike or hurting yourself. 
Remember: Even the best the bike mechan-
ics ask for help sometimes.

n a perfect world, your bike would never break down mid-ride. You’d be 
able to anticipate and prevent any malfunctions before they happened. 
Unfortunately, you can’t predict when your bike is going to give out, cause 
you problems, or be involved in a collision that makes it unrideable. The only 
thing you know for sure is that there’s always a chance that one day you’ll be 
broken down on the side of the road and need to make an emergency repair if 
you have any hopes of finishing your ride.
When it comes to emergency bike repairs, your best bet is to be prepared. 
There’s no AAA or OnStar service that’ll come to your rescue if you break 
down. Plus, it may happen in an area where there are few bikers to help you 
out, and you may not have a friend or family member available to pick you 
up. Nothing is worse than planning a nice, long bicycle ride and ending up 
taking a not-so-nice, long hike while pushing your bicycle. In times like these, 
you’ll be thankful that you took some time to read this chapter.
In this chapter, I explain the importance of keeping the appropriate tools 
with you to make repairs, fixing common sources of bike breakdowns, being 
able to identify those repairs that make your bike unsafe to ride, and getting 
creative and improvising a solution with whatever materials you can round 
up in order to hold your bike together until you can get it home.

When You Can’t Call AAA: Handling 
Your Own Bike Repairs on the Side 
of the Road
Your bike can break down in numerous ways — in this section, we cover the 
most likely scenarios. If you know how to handle the repairs in this section, 
you’ll be able to ride with confidence, knowing that there’s nowhere you 
can’t go on your bike.
 
When you ride, always keep a set of tools available so that when emergency 
strikes, you’re prepared to deal with it. (See Chapter 16 for a list of tools you 
should bring along when you ride.)
Repairing a bent rim
Even if you do your best to avoid objects in the road, sooner or later a pot-
hole will sneak up on you and you won’t be able to avoid it. If your tires are 
inflated properly, your wheels should absorb the blow and you shouldn’t have 
a problem. But if you hit one of the bottomless potholes that some cities are 
infamous for — the kind that look like they were left by a landmine — or you 
crash into a curb or some other immovable object, you may end up damaging 
your wheel so much that you can’t ride. If your wheel is bent or “tacoed” and 
it won’t roll even if the brake is removed (like the one in Figure 4-1), you may 
need to bend it back into shape in order to make the trip home.
Although the wheel may be beyond repair and will probably have to be 
replaced, your immediate goal is to return it as close as possible to the origi-
nal shape so that it’ll spin and clear the brakes.
Here’s how to repair a bent wheel to get you back home:
 
1. Remove the wheel from the frame.
 
2. With the tire on the wheel, grab the sides of the wheel with both 
hands, with the bent part facing away from you.
 
3. Find something like a curb where you can support the wheel at an 
angle with the hub elevated on the ground.
 
4. Using your weight, try to forcefully press down on the wheel against 
the direction of the buckle.
 
 Repeat this a few times — that may be enough to correct the bend. If 
not, continue to Step 5.

55
 Chapter 4: Making like MacGyver: Handling Repairs on the Road
 
Figure 4-1: 
A bent rim.
 
 
5. If the previous step is not enough to return the wheel to a round 
shape, try hitting the bent part of the rim against the ground.
 
 Hit it several times, like a blacksmith shaping a piece of metal, until 
it begins to resemble a round wheel again. Start with a soft blow and 
increase the intensity with each blow, after examining the rim for 
results. This is a last-ditch effort if all else fails.
 
Have the rim replaced after you get home.
Replacing a broken spoke
Wheels are amazing things: Even though they have rims that are suspended 
by, on average, 28 to 36 thin metal spokes, they can take a tremendous 
amount of punishment. A wheel gets its strength from the equal or balanced 
tension spread across its spokes. Remove a spoke, and this tension becomes 
unbalanced, causing the wheel to spin out of alignment or true, and poten-
tially making the wheel unsafe to ride on.
The only permanent solution to a broken spoke is to replace it and retrue the 
wheel. But if you break a spoke while you’re riding, follow these steps to get 
yourself home:

56
Part I: Getting Started 
 
1. Identify the broken spoke and remove it.
 
 If you can’t remove the spoke, wrap it around one of the neighboring 
spokes, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
2. If you have a replacement spoke, first remove the wheel and tire.
 
 If you don’t have a replacement spoke or can’t replace it, loosen the two 
spokes that are adjacent to the broken spoke. This will help balance out 
the tension in the wheel and bring it somewhat back into alignment.
 
3. Insert the spoke through the hub hole and weave it through the other 
spokes in the same form as the rest of the spokes.
 
4. Insert the nipple through the rim, and tighten it using a spoke wrench 
from your emergency tool kit.
 
5. Tighten the spoke to a tension where it makes a similar sound when 
you pluck it like a harp as the sound made by plucking the rest of the 
spokes.
 
6. Spin the wheel to see if it has a bend and adjust the spoke tension to 
straighten it if needed.

Fixing flats and torn tires
You should always have your patch kit available when you ride, because 
sooner or later a flat will sneak up on you. (For instructions on how to change 
a flat, see Chapter 6.) It’s also good to have a spare tube on hand in case a 
tube blows out and can’t be patched.
 
Before you reassemble the wheel, don’t forget to inspect the tire and tube for 
the sharp object that caused the flat. Otherwise, you might be stuck on the 
side of the road repairing a flat in another five minutes.
If you have a torn or ripped tire, you’ll want to fix it as soon as possible or 
risk blowing the tube — especially if the tube has started protruding out 
through the tear. Bike stores sell tire boots, which you can use to reinforce 
the inside of the tire where the cut is located. If you don’t have a tire boot, 
there are a number of alternatives that’ll do the job. Dollar bills, duct tape, 
food wrappers, plastic cut from a soda bottle — you’re only limited by your 
imagination. (To repair or boot a tire, see the steps in Chapter 6.)
Repairing a broken chain
A broken chain is a pretty infrequent event, though as newer chains are 
manufactured to be narrower this occurrence is becoming increasingly 
more common. When a chain breaks, the outer plates on one of the links are 
twisted and/or ripped off, causing damage to the link and possibly to your 
bike. You can repair the chain in an emergency, but as soon as you get home, 
you should replace it.
To repair a broken chain:
 
1. Remove the chain from the bike and, using a chain tool from your 
emergency tool kit, remove the affected link or links.
 
 Follow the instructions in Chapter 10 for using the chain tool.
 
2. If you have extra links, use the chain tool to connect the extra links to 
the chain, replacing the damaged links.
 
 If you don’t have extra links, you can shorten the chain by removing the 
faulty links and reconnecting the chain. However, you most likely won’t 
be able to shift into the gears when the chain is in the larger cogs in the 
rear and the largest chainring in the front.
 
3. Reconnect the chain using the chain tool and following the steps in 
Chapter 10.
 
 Examine all the rivets and links to be sure that there are no other weak-
nesses in the chain.

Extracting a jammed chain
A jammed chain (like the one shown in Figure 4-3) can be one of the most 
annoying malfunctions when you’re riding. A jammed chain often happens 
when the front derailleur shifts the chain too far inward and over the small-
est chainring. It can also be caused by a worn chainring not grabbing the 
chain properly or mud clogging the chain and chainring.
 
Figure 4-3: 
A jammed 
chain.
 
Dennis has had this happen to him while shifting into his smallest or 
“granny” gear during a steep climb. Trying to stop pedaling when you’re on a 
sharp incline on a bike loaded down with pannier bags is awful — it takes all 
your energy not to fall over and become fresh roadkill.
 
The best thing to do when you hear a loud, grinding sound when you shift is 
to stop pedaling immediately. If you continue to apply force to the pedals, you 
could further jam the chain and make it even more difficult to remove.
To extract a jammed chain:
 
1. Try pulling on the chain to separate it from the chainstay and 
chainring.
 
 Be careful not to twist it — you don’t want to damage the chain in any way.

59
 Chapter 4: Making like MacGyver: Handling Repairs on the Road
 
2. If pulling on the chain is not enough to free it, try rotating the cranks 
backward while you pull the chain.
 
 This is often enough to spring the chain loose. If not, move to Step 3.
 
3. Insert a screwdriver between the chainring and chainstay and, using 
it as a lever, gently pry open the space.
 
 This should allow you to slide the chain out (if not, move on to Step 
4). Check the chainrings for any damage caused using this method and 
straighten as necessary.
 
4. Separate the chain with a chain tool.
 
 Note: This step should only be used as a last resort, when all the preced-
ing steps fail.
Dealing with the derailleur
If the front derailleur gets hit or the chain gets stuck when you try to shift, 
the derailleur can become twisted or bent. If the derailleur moves out of 
place by twisting on the seat tube, you’ll want to move it back into place.
Follow these steps to adjust the position of the front derailleur:
 
1. Loosen the derailleur clamp bolt, which keeps it attached to the seat 
post.
 
 Usually a 5mm Allen wrench or 8mm box wrench will do the trick.
 
2. Position the derailleur so that its cage is parallel with the chainrings 
and only 1mm above the top of the largest chainring.
 
3. Retighten the clamp bolt.
 
 See Chapter 14 for more details on installing a front derailleur.
If the derailleur is bent or damaged, you’ll need to remove it and continue 
your ride without it. Follow these steps to remove the front derailleur:
 
1. Remove the screw at the back of the front derailleur cage.
 
2. Separate the cage and remove the chain.
 
3. Bypass the derailleur and place the chain on the chainring that will 
best serve you on your ride home.
 
4. Remove the clamp bolt holding the derailleur to the seat tube, discon-
nect the shift wire, and detach the derailleur from the bike.
 
 You’ll need to move the shift wire into a position out of the way or com-
pletely remove it.

60
Part I: Getting Started 
Like the chain, the rear derailleur is a very exposed part of the bike. It sticks 
out and has very little protection. If you brush up against or hit something 
while you’re riding, you can easily bend or damage it. A bent rear derailleur 
frequently is the result of a bike that falls over on that side.
 
Most mountain bikes use a replaceable derailleur hanger that is designed to 
fail before the expensive derailleur itself would. In this case, buy your bike’s 
replacement hanger, and keep it with you when you ride.
Although modern rear derailleurs are precise instruments that are sensitive 
to the slightest adjustments, if you’re in a jam and a bent rear derailleur is 
causing your from finishing your trip, you can try manually bending it back 
into place. You can do this by inserting an Allen wrench into the mounting 
bolt and pulling upward while you pull the S-shaped cage away from the bike 
using your other hand, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Unbending 
a bent rear 
derailleur.
 
 
If you straightened out the rear derailleur enough to ride home, you may 
want to take it to your local bike shop to be properly tuned. Bike mechanics 
use a special rear derailleur hanger alignment tool to properly position the 
derailleur.
If the rear derailleur is damaged beyond repair and won’t shift or allow you 
to continue biking, you’ll need to bypass the derailleur and turn your bike 
into a single speed. If this happens to you, follow these steps to get back on 
the road:

61
 Chapter 4: Making like MacGyver: Handling Repairs on the Road
 
1. Use a chain tool to separate the chain.
 
 See Chapter 10 for more information on separating and reconnecting 
a chain.
 
2. Decide on a gear that is appropriate for your ride home.
 
 We recommend that you pick the middle chainring on triple-chainring 
bikes or the smallest chainring on two-chainring bikes and the middle 
cog in the cassette. Leave the rear derailleur on the bicycle.
 
3. Hold the chain together to determine if there is any overlap in the 
two ends.
 
 If there is, you’ll need to remove some links in order to keep enough 
tension on the chain.
 
4. After removing the additional links, reconnect the chain.
 
 Spin the cranks a few times to be sure that there is enough tension on 
the chain and that it won’t come off the chainring. If it doesn’t, you 
should be good enough to finish your journey.
If a cable is old, worn, or frayed there is a chance one may break while you’re 
riding. If it’s a cable for the derailleurs, you’ll be limited in the number of 
gears you can use, but you’ll still be able to ride home.
If the front derailleur cable breaks, the lack of tension will move the derail-
leur to the left and position the chain on the smallest chainring. If you have 
a triple chainring and want to use the middle chainring, pull the derailleur 
over the middle chainring and tighten the L-limit screw (shown in Figure 4-5) 
to keep it in place. For more details on adjusting the front derailleur, refer to 
Chapter 14.
In the case of a rear derailleur cable break, the derailleur will move the chain to 
the smallest cog on the cassette. If you’re comfortable riding in this gear, you 
can finish your ride. However, if you need a more appropriate gear, you’ll need 
to adjust the rear derailleur. Keep in mind that there is only a limited amount 
of adjustments with this method and you might only be able to use one of the 
three smallest cogs. To make the adjustment, follow these three steps:
 
1. Place the chain on one of the larger cogs.
 
2. Use your hand to push in on the rear derailleur.
 
3. Tighten the H-limit screw (shown in Figure 4-6) to keep the derailleur 
in place.
 
 Keep in mind that you may have to fine-tune the position of the derail-
leur so that the chain runs smoothly.

Knowing When You Should Walk Home
Certain repairs probably shouldn’t be attempted while you’re on the road. 
In some cases, you probably won’t have the tools with you. In other cases, 
the chance of a malfunction happening makes continued riding a dangerous 
proposition.
Here are some situations when you should put away your emergency tool kit 
and start walking home:
 
✓ When your brake cables have broken: If you break a brake cable, you’ll 
be limited to half your brakes. Not only will you have reduced braking 
power, but applying only the front or rear brakes could cause you to 
have an accident. Squeeze too hard on only the front brakes and you 
wind up being thrown head forward over your handlebars. Do the same 
with the rear brakes, and you could skid out. When your front or rear 
brakes are out, your best bet is to walk your bike if possible or ride it 
home very slowly.
 
✓ When your crank is loose or has fallen off: If the crank has loosened 
or fallen off, it may be best to call it a day. The crank must be tightened 
with a significant amount of torque and this tightening is best done with 
the proper tools (including a torque wrench) and with the bike sup-
ported by a bike stand if possible.
 
✓ When your pedals are loose: Pedals can be secured with the proper 
wrench, but if you don’t have one available, you should walk your bike 
home. Riding with a loose pedal will damage the crank and could lead to 
an accident if the threads give out.
 
✓ When you have a problem with the bottom bracket: Working on the 
bottom bracket requires specialized tools that most riders wouldn’t con-
sider taking along on a ride. If the bottom bracket comes loose or falls 
apart, don’t continue to ride.
 
✓ When your frame is damaged: A damaged frame is usually the result of 
an accident. If you’ve had an accident, you should immediately inspect 
the bike, paying particular attention to the frame. Besides looking at 
the frame from different directions to determine if it’s bent, you should 
inspect the frame close up, looking for cracks, especially in any welded 
sections, as well as cracks, bubbles, or ripples in the paint. (See the fol-
lowing section for more on what to do after an accident.). A damaged 
or bent frame undermines the integrity of the bike and increases the 
chance of an accident.

64
Part I: Getting Started 
Inspecting Your Bike after an Accident
Even if you’re the world’s safest and most cautious biker, there’s always a 
chance you could end up in an accident. When you’re on a bike moving for-
ward on two thin wheels, you’re completely exposed. Add in the fact that you’ll 
end up biking on busy roads, crowded bike paths, or the ever dangerous off-
road trails, and you increase the odds that you’ll have a crash eventually.
 
Always wear a helmet, wear biking gloves, and keep a cellphone and identifi-
cation with you at all times.
If you do end up in an accident, the first thing you should do is make sure 
you’re okay. The shock of being involved in a collision may keep you from 
realizing that you’re injured. If after checking yourself out, you’re lucky 
enough to have nothing more than a scratch or two, the next thing to con-
sider is the state of your bike.
Most modern bikes are designed with components and materials that can 
resist certain types of impact. However, in the case of an accident, you’ll 
want to thoroughly inspect your bike before getting back on it to ride. 
Something may have come loose or the collision may have caused a weak-
ness in the frame or some other part of the bike that may become apparent 
later on down the road.
Looking for looseness
One of the simplest ways to identify if there is a problem with your bike after 
a crash is to check for looseness. Spend a few minutes to make sure that all 
the parts of your bike are still securely fastened and in place as they should 
be. You’re much better off finding a potential issue at this point rather than 
discovering it when the part falls off your bike.
To check for looseness, perform the following steps:
 
1. Straddle the front wheel pinching it between your thighs.
 
2. Grip the handlebars and try to twist them side to side.
 
3. Straddle the frame, squeeze the brakes, and try to rock the bicycle 
back and forth.
 
 If there is play in the handlebars or stem, it could mean either that the 
clamp bolts need to be tightened or you have a loose headset, some-
thing that could be dangerous at high speeds.
 
4. While straddling the bike, use the handlebars to lift the front wheel 
off the ground.

65
 Chapter 4: Making like MacGyver: Handling Repairs on the Road
 
5. Drop the handlebars and let the bike hit the ground.
 
 If you hear any jingling or rattling, it could mean that something on the 
bike is loose. Repeat the procedure to isolate the location of the noise.
Checking the alignment
If your bike was involved in a collision, there’s a chance that something has 
been bent or broken and caused your bike to be out of alignment. Unless 
you visually inspect your bike, you may not notice that there is a concern. 
This is especially important with the frame, which helps keep you balanced, 
influences the bike’s handling, and provides stability. A crash can impact the 
integrity of the frame and make riding your bike a risky proposition.
 
An important factor in how well a frame can hold up to a collision is the mate-
rial it’s made of. Different frame materials offer varying levels of strength. 
Frames made of steel and steel alloys are amazingly strong, as are titanium 
frames. Aluminum frames, on the other hand, while having the benefit of being 
lighter than steel, are also weaker and fatigue over time. Carbon, which is a pop-
ular choice these days for frames, is made of up fibers that are arranged into a 
pattern, which gives significant strength to the material; however, carbon can 
be prone to breakage where the different tubes of the frame are connected.
To perform an alignment check from the front of the bike, perform the 
following steps:
 
1. Stand in front of your bike with the wheel between your legs and the 
handlebars in your hands, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
2. Eyeball the various angles of the frame.
 
 You should confirm that the head tube is parallel with the seat tube and 
that the top tube is in the same plane as the down tube.
 
3. Look down at the forks to confirm that they’re evenly spaced around 
the wheel.
To perform an alignment check from the back of the bike, follow these steps:
 
1. Have someone support your bike while you stand behind it.
 
2. Visually confirm that the seat tube and the head tube are in alignment.
 
3. Check to see that the seat stays are straight.
 
4. While you’re visually examining the frame, look at other parts of the 
bike, including the cranks and pedals and the front and rear derailleurs.
 
 The rear derailleur should be hanging straight down and be positioned 
under one of the cogs.

The All-Purpose Repair Tool: Duct Tape
If you pack the emergency repair kit described in Chapter 16, you should be 
able to handle many of the basic emergencies that may strike when you ride. 
However, at some point, you may find yourself in a situation where a part of 
your bike needs repairing or replacing and you don’t have the tools to do the 
job, but you still need to keep riding. This is when you need to put on your 
MacGyver hat and get creative. A piece of wire on the side of the road may 
be good enough to secure a loose bottle cage. A PowerBar wrapper could be 
used to boot a tire. Really the only limit to bike repair and maintenance — at 
least as a temporary fix — is your imagination.
Perhaps the most valuable of the multipurpose materials you can use to fix 
your bike is duct tape. Serious bikers always leave a roll in their bag for spe-
cial emergencies. Duct tape is strong and secure, resists water, and can get 
you out of a number of jams. Here’s a list of some of the things you can do 
using duct tape and a little old-fashioned ingenuity:
 
✓ Hold a torn saddle together
 
✓ Keep a loose saddle post from coming off
 
✓ Secure a bike pump to your frame if the mounting bracket breaks

67
 Chapter 4: Making like MacGyver: Handling Repairs on the Road
 
✓ Repair rips or tears in clothing, pouches, and pannier bags
 
✓ Attach a flashlight to your bike or helmet
 
✓ Hold together a cracked helmet at least until you can get home and 
replace it
 
✓ Hold together frayed cable ends
 
✓ Boot a torn tire
 
✓ Secure a broken buckle on a shoe
 
✓ Hold a bottle on a bike if the cage falls off
 
Any and all repairs, patches, and fixes using duct tape are temporary and 
must be replaced at the earliest possible time.

I
f you’re serious about making biking a part of your life, you’ll want to 
have people you can call for help when you need it. You’ll want someone 
you can trust to help you buy the right bike, fit it to your body style, and 
accessorize it as needed. You’ll want someone to turn to when it comes time 
to make complicated repairs. You’ll want help if you’re looking for a biking 
group or a new trail or you want to add some biking clothes to your ward-
robe. In other words, you need a local bike shop.
Usually owned and operated by hard-working people whose zeal for biking 
is only matched by their desire to share it with others, local bike shops are 
some of the best resources you can find to support you with your biking 
needs. In this chapter, we discuss the bike-shop experience, including what 
you can expect to find when visiting one, what you should look for, and how 
to choose one that’s right for you. We also tell you how to get the most out 
of your bike shop, including using them to shop for a bike and to handle the 
most challenging repairs.
What to Look for in a Bike Shop
Bicycle shops can sometimes be intimidating — especially if you’re new to 
biking. You walk in and the store is crowded with bikes and bike parts. Bikes 
are hanging from the ceiling, accessories cover the walls, there may be bike 
videos playing and posters of bikers hanging on the wall. But the fact of the 
matter is: Most bicycle-store employees are bikers with a passion for biking 
who love to share their knowledge of and excitement for the sport.

70
Part I: Getting Started 
Although most areas have several bicycle stores, they aren’t on every street 
corner. In fact, depending on where you live, there may be only a few in your 
area. Even so, you should visit each shop to get a feel for which store is right 
for you.
 
Talk with other bikers for recommendations for local stores and then visit a 
couple of stores to meet the staff and check out their product line. Knowing a 
bike shop staffed by people who understand your needs and are knowledge-
able enough to help you with any issue will go a long way toward improving 
your overall biking experience.
Take the time to get to know the staff at the shop you like — they’ll be a great 
source of information, helping with everything from places to ride to how to 
find group rides. They can offer advice on the newest and coolest parts and 
accessories. And they can even give you advice if you want to do some of the 
adjustment and maintenance yourself.
In fact, a good bike-shop staff members will encourage you to do your own 
work. A bike shop shouldn’t be about making customers dependent on their 
services in order to get more business out of them. It should be empowering 
its customers so that when they have problems, the customers can handle it 
themselves.
 
Here are the main features you may want to look for in a bike shop:
 
✓ Customer service: Most bicycle stores take a lot of pride in customer 
service, and strive to have the best customer service possible. Usually, 
when you first walk into a store you can feel what the level of customer 
service is going to be. If you’re greeted shortly after entering, if the 
staff members are easily identified with uniforms, if they have adequate 
hours, if the store is clean and well lit, and if there’s a good assortment 
of merchandise displayed in an inviting way, these are sure signs of a 
store that cares about its customers.
 
✓ Year-round service: One of the best times to take advantage of the 
services of a bike shop is during the winter season. Instead of hanging 
your bike up for the winter hibernation, think about using this time to 
do annual maintenance and upgrades. The benefit is that, because most 
people aren’t riding as much, bicycle stores aren’t as busy and can 
spend more quality time with customers advising and servicing their 
bicycles. During peak season, the bicycle stores are sometimes backed 
up and you may not be able to get an appointment if you need one.
 
 One benefit of year-round service is being ready for spring. Nothing is 
worse than sitting in your garage or basement on a beautiful spring day 
with grease on your hands working on your bicycle instead of being 

71
 Chapter 5: Help! When You Need Professional Assistance
out on the road or trail — all because you haven’t worked on your bike 
during the winter.
 
 Most bicycle stores will offer a limited-time warranty on the repair work 
they perform so make sure to ask the next time you visit.
 
✓ Expertise: You want to find a bike shop with expert staff. Talk with the 
staff and get a feel for whether this job is just a part-time one for them 
to make some extra money or whether they do it for the love of biking. 
The best staff are those who exude a passion for biking and who love to 
share their excitement for bikes with others.
 
 If an employee doesn’t have the experience or knowledge, he should be 
able to ask another employee for the answer. The bicycle industry has 
many different service classes for mechanics, and there should be at 
least one staff member with this kind of training. Of course, a mechanics 
class doesn’t replace years of experience working on bikes.
 
✓ Women and family friendly: Some bike shops are staffed by hard-core 
male bikers who are interested in racing, top-end bikes, working on 
bikes, and other riders who share their interests. When it comes to the 
needs of women and families, most of these guys are pretty much clue-
less. Unless you fit that same description, look for a bike shop with a 
staff that includes a mix of men and women who can relate to women’s 
biking issues (such as clothing, riding interests, and how to fit a bike to 
the physiology of a women). If you have kids (or you think you might 
in the future), you also want a bike-shop staff who can assist families 
with their biking needs. Fitting bikes to children is as important as fit-
ting them to adults. For example, a child’s saddle should be positioned 
so that he can place both feet flat on the ground. In addition, children 
should ride in a more upright position so that they can more easily keep 
their eyes on the road ahead.
 
 You don’t have to worry about which brand of bike you have or which 
brands the store sells. Most bicycle stores will work on all models and 
brands.
 
✓ Turnaround time: When you do have to take your bicycle into the 
bicycle store, remember you aren’t the only one who is desperate to 
have their bike ready to ride this weekend. Sometimes you can get your 
bicycle fixed while you wait, and other times you may have to leave your 
bike for a few days while they order that special part or repair the other 
bicycles brought in before yours.
 
 Some bicycle stores allow you to make an appointment so if your bicycle 
is still rideable, you can continue putting on those miles until they’re 
ready to work on it.

Shopping at Your Bike Shop
The most significant benefit you’ll get from working with a bike shop is the 
obvious: They can help you buy the bike that’s right for you. Sure, you can 
use the Internet to find a bike, and save some money. But if you shop online, 
you’re missing what only a bike shop can provide: the personal touch and 
customer service. The hands-on, face-to-face service of a bike shop is invalu-
able when you’re searching for the right bike. Plus, the folks at your local 
bike shop can help with sizing and the assembly of your bike.
When you shop at your local bike shop, you’re building a relationship that 
will benefit you when you need additional support.
Buying a bike
Whether you buy a bike online or at a bike shop, it’ll need some initial adjust-
ments and an inspection. The benefit of buying from a bike shop is that they 
can make these adjustments when you buy it.
The cost of doing business
Like any business, every bicycle store is in the 
business to make money. This doesn’t mean the 
owners and employees are driving around town 
in their Lamborghinis, wearing Rolex watches, 
or drinking Dom Perignon. Selling bicycles is a 
hard business to be successful at — it involves 
a high overhead, low profit margins, and a con-
stant need for trained and educated staff. Plus, 
staying in tune with the bicycling industry and 
the evolving technology behind it is a constant 
challenge.
In most cases, you’ll find that employees and 
owners choose to work in the biking industry 
because they have a true love and passion for 
the sport. They enjoy working with and helping 
people discover and develop the same love and 
passion for biking.
For a bike-shop owner, it’s satisfying and 
rewarding to see a family out on the trail having 
some real quality time, knowing that they’ve 
outfitted them with bicycles and/or acces-
sories. It’s equally rewarding to talk with the 
person who started as a recreational cyclist 
and is now addicted to biking and rides or com-
mutes to work every day.
These are a few of the reasons that drive many 
of the people who work in your local bicycle 
stores. Keep this in mind the next time you’re 
shopping for that cool new bicycle part or 
accessory upgrade. They need to make a little 
profit so they can continue to pay the bills and 
be there the next time you need something.

73
 Chapter 5: Help! When You Need Professional Assistance
Plus, when you buy a bike from a local bike store, they won’t just put the 
pedals, seat, and handlebars on your bicycle and send you off. They’ll disas-
semble your bicycle first. They’ll take many of the parts off and double-check 
and fine-tune them before assembling and checking everything and making 
the final adjustments.
When you arrive to pick up your bike, they’ll go over the bicycle with you, 
making sure it’s fitted and adjusted to your personal riding style and comfort. 
They’ll go over its function, show you how everything works, and give you 
riding tips.
After you’ve put some miles on your bike, the gear and brake cable will 
stretch and need adjustment, the spokes will settle into place and need 
truing, the bearings will loosen up and need adjustments — and all of this can 
be done for free by many shops. They know that this initial break-in period 
is the must critical time for the best performance and extended life of your 
bicycle, so they want to take care of it for you.
Use the Internet to research the bikes you’re interested in. Almost all manu-
facturers have very user-friendly Web sites that can help you when you walk 
into your local shop and start trying out different bikes.
 
Here are some of the major bicycle manufacturers and their Web addresses:
 
✓ Cannondale: www.cannondale.com
 
✓ Fuji: www.fujibikes.com
 
✓ Gary Fisher: www.fisherbikes.com
 
✓ Giant: www.giant-bicycles.com
 
✓ Kona: www.konaworld.com

✓ Schwinn: www.schwinnbike.com
 
✓ Specialized: www.specialized.com
 
✓ Trek: www.trekbikes.com
 
When you’re looking for a bike with the help of a bike shop, they’ll help you 
figure out which type of bike is most suited for your needs. There are many 
different types of bikes available, each with their own benefits:
 
✓ Road bikes are built for smooth pavement riding and fast speeds. They’re 
lightweight for easier acceleration and top speeds. They have thin, higher 
pressure tires (for less rolling resistance) and dropped handlebars (to 
support a bent-over riding position for better aerodynamics).

74
Part I: Getting Started 
 
✓ Mountain bikes are built for riding on trails and rough terrain. They 
have higher-performance brakes for long and steep descents; thick, 
knobby tires for better traction in steep and/or loose terrain; and sus-
pension for more control and comfort.
 
✓ Hybrid bikes are all-purpose bikes that combine features of a road and 
mountain bike. They weigh more than road bikes but less than mountain 
bikes. Their tire circumference size compares to a road bike, and the 
tire width is wider than on a road bike and narrower than on a moun-
tain bike. A hybrid bike gives you a little of the performance of a road 
bike and the comfort and durability of a mountain bike. They have flat 
handlebars for a comfortable upright riding position.
 
✓ Touring bikes are built to carry heavier loads across long distances. 
They have mountings for bike racks to carry your gear, a wider frame 
(for stability), wheels with more spokes (to support the additional 
weight of gear and for greater durability on long, hard rides), and a 
greater range of gears for wide variety of elevation changes.
 
✓ Cruiser bikes are designed for leisurely riding. They have very few 
(if any) gears. They’re built for an upright riding position, with a wide 
saddle. They have fat, soft tires for a super-comfortable ride. Some 
cruiser bikes have coaster brakes (in which you pedal backward to 
stop).
 
✓ Recumbent bikes are designed for riders who want a reclined riding posi-
tion. On a recumbent bike, you can’t stand to pedal up hills and stretch 
your legs on long rides; you’re limited to that one, reclined position for 
your entire ride. Recumbent bikes are good for riders with back prob-
lems. Some have coaster brakes (in which you pedal backward to stop).
 
 Recumbent bikes are more difficult for drivers of cars to see than the 
other types of bikes are.
 
✓ BMX bikes are built to ride off-road on a dirt track or to do tricks. They 
have small frames for quick handling, tricks, and jumping. They’re made 
of very durable components and have foot pegs or extensions off the 
frame for performing stunts.
 
Before you buy a bike, be sure to test-ride it — and test-ride a variety of other 
bikes, too. It’s hard to get a feel for a bike unless you compare it against other 
bikes. You can do all the research online, read all the bicycle magazines, talk 
with the staff at the bicycle store, talk with your neighborhood or office bicy-
cle guru, but until you ride the bike, you won’t know for sure if it’s the right 
one for you.
 
You should always wear a helmet when riding a bike — and, easy as it is to 
overlook, this is especially true when you’re test-riding. You’re more likely to 
have an accident on a bike and in territory that you’re not familiar with.

 Chapter 5: Help! When You Need Professional Assistance
 
When test-riding, find a location with enough space so that you can observe 
how the bike handles at lower and higher speeds. Riding the bike at different 
speeds will allow you try out a range of the gears. If you can, ride it uphill so 
that you can use the higher gears. Here’s some of what you should feel on 
your ride:
 
✓ Shifting between gears should be smooth and almost effortless.
 
✓ The bike should ride in a straight line and the wheels shouldn’t wobble.
 
✓ The bike should be easy to handle and smooth in the turns.
 
✓ The brakes should grip the wheel firmly and slow you down or stop you 
smoothly.
 
✓ Your arms should comfortably reach the handlebars without being too 
bent or locked out.
 
✓ You should be able to easily grip the shifters and brakes without having 
your wrists in an awkward position.
A test ride will also give you an idea of the quality of work and service the 
bicycle store will offer you after the initial purchase. Before they send you 
out on a test ride, the folks at the bike shop should:
 
✓ Check all the nuts and bolts on the bicycle.
 
✓ Make sure the brakes and gears work properly.
 
✓ Check the tires for proper air pressure.
 
✓ Set the seat and handlebar position for you.
 
✓ Inform you of the proper gear and brake operations.
 
✓ Give you ridings tips, such as what to look and feel for on your test ride.
Shopping for a used bike
For many people, buying a used bike is the way 
to go. Sometimes you can find a great deal when 
shopping for a used bike if you know where to 
look and what to look for.
Many times, you can find a newer used bike at 
a significant discount. You may come across 
someone who recently purchased a bike and, 
for whatever reason (she’s moving, he needs 
the money) — has to sell. A bike is just like a 
car in one way: The moment it’s sold for the 
first time, it depreciates in price. Buy a bike 
after that initial sale, and you could be getting 
a real steal.
Not all bike shops sell used bikes, but those 
that do will have usually inspected the bike 
and made any necessary repairs before selling 
them. So if your local bike shop sells used bikes, 
that’s a great place to start.

Buying accessories
Bike shops are great when it comes to helping you find the right biking acces-
sories. Staff in many bike shops use much of the equipment they sell, so they 
can talk to you about what works well and will fit with your budget. When 
you’ve found a bike shop you trust, the staff can even advise you if they think 
that a more expensive product isn’t worth the additional cost or if a cheaper 
product is cheaper for a reason and should be avoided.
(continued)
Beyond bike shops, you can shop at flea mar-
kets and garage sales; peruse the classifieds in 
the local paper; or check the Internet. Sites like 
eBay (www.ebay.com) and craigslist (www.
craigslist.org) offer a wide variety of 
bikes. The advantage of craigslist is that you 
can shop in your town and likely take the bike 
for a test-ride before you buy.
You can tell a lot about a bike and how it was 
maintained just by looking at it. If there is rust 
and corrosion in the chains or cables, if the 
paint is worn and chipped, if the tires are start-
ing to rot, this could be a sign that the bike was 
neglected and may not be worth the invest-
ment.
If you’re going to test-ride a used bike that 
isn’t being sold by a bike shop, be careful. The 
owner may not have maintained the bike and, in 
the worst-case scenario, something may come 
loose or fall off, causing you to crash. Before 
you ride, perform the pre-ride inspection from 
Chapter 16. In particular make sure that:
 ✓ The brakes work.
 ✓ There is no looseness in the handlebars or 
headset.
 ✓ The pedals and cranks are secure and the 
bottom bracket is not loose or binding.
 ✓ There are no bad links in the chain and the 
cog and chainring teeth are not worn.
 ✓ The wheels are attached properly and there 
is air in the tires.
 ✓ Assume that you’ll have to do some repairs 
or tune-ups on the bike, and evaluate the 
bike to diagnose just how much repair is 
needed. You can get a great deal if you’re 
willing to do some of the repair yourself, but 
don’t take on too much — the bike may not 
be worth it.
 ✓ Check all bearing surfaces, the bottom 
bracket, the headset, the hubs, and the 
pedals. If these are in bad shape, an over-
haul may not be sufficient and those parts 
may be shot.
 ✓ Inspect the drivetrain. Are the chain and the 
cogs/chainrings in good shape, or are they 
significantly worn? A blown-out drivetrain 
could be prohibitively expensive to repair.
 ✓ Are the wheels true? Are the rims in good 
shape, or are they worn on the braking sur-
face? What is the quality of the brand of the 
wheels? This information helps determine 
the value of the bike.
 ✓ Are the cables still usable? When you shift 
or brake, is there resistance from fric-
tion and corrosion, or are they smooth? 
Replacing cabling can be a pain.
 ✓ Is the frame free from rust and dents?

77
 Chapter 5: Help! When You Need Professional Assistance
Here are some accessories you may want to consider buying:
 
✓ Helmet: For safety reasons, a helmet should be at the top of your list. 
The bike-shop staff can help you find a helmet that fits properly and 
doesn’t move around on your head. They can also help you adjust the 
straps to fine-tune the fit.
 
 Sizing is very important. A $20 helmet sized properly will protect you 
better than a $150 helmet that doesn’t fit or is not adjusted properly.
 
✓ Lock: If you’re ever going to leave your bike alone for more than a 
minute or two, you’ll want a lock. The folks at your local shop can help 
you find a balance between a lock that’s difficult to cut and one that 
doesn’t weigh too much.
 
✓ Gloves: Biking gloves will reduce vibrations and provide protection if 
your fall off your bike. Bike-shop staff can help you decide whether to 
get gel padding, full fingers, or cutoffs, and how tight the gloves should 
fit. They may suggest rolling your gloves off rather than pulling at the 
fingers (which can prematurely tear the stitching).
 
✓ Bike pumps: You’ll need two pumps: a mini bike pump to mount onto 
the frame and a larger pump to keep in the house. You may also want to 
consider a CO2 cartridge system for quick and easy tire inflating. They’re 
a little more expensive than traditional tire pumps, but they’ll get you 
back on the road fast.
 
✓ Lights: Bike lights will keep you safe if you get caught out after dark. The 
folks at your bike shop can offer suggestions on what types of bulbs are 
best for both front and rear lights, whether rechargeable batteries are 
the way to go, and where to mount the lights.
 
✓ Computer: A computer will track statistics regarding each of your rides 
and provide motivation when you ride to exercise. Staff can help you 
decide if you need extra features such as a heart monitor, altimeter, and 
wireless connection.
 
✓ Shoes: Biking shoes designed to work with clipless pedals will signifi-
cantly improve your pedaling efficiency. Staff will advise you on whether 
to buy stiff road biking shoes or ones designed for walking, as well as 
talk to you about the best type of material and whether the shoes will 
work with your pedals.
 
✓ Clothes: Bike clothes can keep you cool in warm weather, warm in cool 
weather, and dry in wet weather. Staff will help you find properly fitting 
clothing for the right season and provides padding and wicks moisture 
where you need it the most.

Recognizing the Repairs 
You Need Help With
With this book in hand, a few tools, and a healthy dose of confidence, 
patience, and determination, you can do just about everything needed to 
maintain and repair your bike. There are only a few situations in which you 
may have to step aside and let the professionals in your local bike shop 
handle the load. In this section, we fill you in on when to leave it for the pros.
Repairing frames
In general, all frame repair should be handled by professionals — either 
your local bicycle store or a professional frame builder/repair facility. Most 
local bicycle stores can handle minor frame alignment issues if they have the 
proper tools and experience. If your bike has any frame-integrity issues — 
such as cracks, dents, or stress marks in the paint — they should be 
inspected, repaired, or replaced by a frame specialist.
 
If you need to have your frame repaired by a specialist, you may as well 
have an extra set of fasteners attached for an extra water bottle, bike rack, 
or tire pump. You may even want to get the cool new paint job you’ve been 
dreaming of.
Installing a new headset
Adjusting a headset is an easy job that you can perform at home or on the 
road. Overhauling a headset is also a job you can perform at home. However, 
installing a new headset is a job probably best saved for the professionals at 
you local bicycle store.
There are several specialty tools required to remove the old headset and 
then install the new one: a fork race removal tool, a headset cup removal 
tool, a fork race setting tool, and a headset cup pressing tool. Plus, you need 
the knowledge to use these tools properly. Most bike shops will have the 
tools and the expertise to put them to use.

79
 Chapter 5: Help! When You Need Professional Assistance
Truing a wheel
The basic concept of straightening a rim by adjusting spoke tension is easy. 
The problems begin when you get into concepts that the professionals call 
dishing or rounding or when you have to straighten a rim that has a flat spot 
or a bend in it and the spokes are all tensioned differently. This is where sig-
nificant expertise is required.
Even with a truing stand, spoke tension meter, dishing tool, and spoke 
wrench, you still need the knowledge and experience to make everything 
come together properly. The big advantage of having your wheels trued 
by a professional is that they’ll stand behind and warranty their work. Just 
because you get the wheel perfectly dished, rounded, and straight doesn’t 
mean the wheel will hold up the first time you go for a ride.
Working on suspension
There are many different types of front and rear suspension and all repair 
work on them should be done either by the manufacturer, your local bicycle 
store, or one of the specialty bicycle suspension repair facilities.
Most of the manufacturers have programs set up so you can ship the suspen-
sion part back to them where they’ll repair it and ship it back to you for a 
nominal charge. A couple of independently owned repair facilities provide 
the same service. The advantage of going through your local bicycle shop 
is that you don’t have to pay the shipping costs, although there are certain 
repairs for which the bicycle store may also have to send the part back to the 
manufacturer for service.
 
Refer to your owners manual for the proper oils and lubricants and the 
routine maintenance you can and should be performing yourself on your 
suspension parts.

lthough a bike is not very complicated, some of the 
procedures required to repair and maintain it are 
more challenging than others. In this part, we cover some 
of the simpler procedures, including those involving the 
wheels, tires and tubes, freewheels and cassettes, brakes, 
and chain. But don’t make the mistake of assuming that 
simple means you can skip it. Some of the information in 
this part is essential to maintaining your bike (for exam-
ple, regularly caring for your chain will prolong its life 
and the lives of all the components the chain comes in

W
hy does it always seem like a flat tire comes at the worse possible 
time? You’re out riding your bike — enjoying the scenery, concentrat-
ing on working up a sweat, or hustling to get to your destination on time — 
when suddenly your trip is interrupted by that irksome troublemaker, the flat 
tire. It starts as an slow, inconspicuous leak of air — it grabs your attention 
only when the tire is completely flat and an abrupt stop to your trip is the 
only option.
If you’re new to biking or you’ve been fortunate enough to have avoided tire 
and tube problems so far, rest assured: Sooner or later, you’ll find yourself on 
the side of the road, tube in hand, searching for that pesky leak.
 
Instead of trying to figure out how to remove a tire and patch a tube the first 
time it strikes, practice fixing and changing a tire before you actually need to. 
When you’re sitting at the side of the road is not the time to figure it out.
In this chapter, I take the mystery out of fixing a flat by explaining step by 
step how to remove a tire, find the puncture, patch the tube, and reassemble 
the wheel. Follow these instructions, and the next time a flat tire tries to 
derail your trip, you’ll be back on your bike in no time.

Why Flat Tires Happen to Good People
When it comes to flat tires, the universe does not play favorites. The next 
victim of a flat could just as easily be Lance Armstrong on an expensive 
racing bike in the French Alps as a little old lady from Kansas on a utility bike 
with a loaf of bread in her basket. Given that none of us is immune, the best 
you can do is understand what causes flats, try to limit the chances of having 
one, and be able to recover from one if you’re on the losing end of this game 
of chance.
Before you figure out how to handle flat tires, you need to know the parts of 
the bike involved:
 
✓ Wheel: The wheel includes the rim, spokes, and hub.
 
✓ Tire: The tire sits between the rim and the road and is made of interwo-
ven fabric and rubber.
 
✓ Tread: The tread is the rubber-coated part of the tire that comes in con-
tact with the road.
 
✓ Tube: The tube is an inflatable balloon that fills up the inside of the tire 
as it expands.
 
✓ Valve: The valve is a metal connector that can be opened and closed to 
inflate or deflate the tube.
When it comes to flats, the tube plays a leading role. The tube provides 
the cushion of air between the road and the rider, allowing for a smooth, 
efficient ride. When the tube is damaged in some way such that it can no 
longer maintain air, a flat is the result. Tube damage can be caused by any 
of the following:
 
✓ Sharp objects: Objects such as glass or a nail can pierce a tire and tube.
 
✓ Low tire pressure: When your tire pressure is low, it’s easier for an 
object to penetrate the tire rather than bounce off.
 
✓ The tube getting caught between the sharp edge of the wheel rim and 
the tire: When this happens, the result is something called a pinched flat 
or snakebite puncture.
 
✓ Tires wearing out: When your tires wear out, they lose their capacity to 
protect the tube.
 
✓ Tubes losing their integrity: If you’ve patched your tubes multiple 
times, they’ll be more prone to damage.

85
 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
Fixing a Flat
If you plan on doing a lot of biking, you’ll probably end up fixing flats regu-
larly. You have two options for recovering from a flat:
 
✓ Install a spare tube. Although this method is a quick, surefire way to get 
back on the road in a matter of minutes, the cost of tubes can add up 
after a while.
 
 Note: In the cases described below, you’ll have to replace the tube:
 
• After you’ have patched a tube a dozen or more times, the integrity 
of the tube starts to break down, leaving you more vulnerable to 
additional flats or a complete blowout. (A blowout is a rip or tear 
in the tube that cannot be patched and requires the tube to be 
replaced).
 
• A damaged stem valve also requires the tube to be replaced.
 
✓ Patch your existing tube. This option is a cheap, reliable fix — and 
it’s the method we recommend. Before long, you’ll be a biking veteran 
proudly showing off the patches on your tube as if they were badges of 
honor.
In this section, we walk you through the entire process of fixing a flat, with a 
focus on patching your tube. We also tell you how to replace a tube, in case 
you really need to.
Grabbing yourself a wheel
Before you can even think about fixing a flat or addressing any other tire or 
tube issue, you need to be able to remove the wheel from the bicycle frame. 
Fortunately, bike manufacturers have made the lives of bike riders easier by 
introducing things such as quick-release hubs and brakes. In the case of bikes 
without the quick release, don’t fret — a wrench will do the trick.
In the following sections, I walk you through loosening the brakes and remov-
ing the wheel, regardless of how your bike was made.
Loosening the brakes
Because brakes are typically designed to sit close to the wheel rim, their 
location normally prevents the wheel from being removed if the tire is fully 
inflated. If you want to remove a wheel, you first have to open the brakes so 
there’s room for the tire to fit through the brake pads.

86
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Many bikes have a quick release built into the brake, which quickly enables 
the cable to slacken and the brakes to spread. The quick release may vary 
depending on what type of brakes your bike has:
 
✓ Cantilever brakes: If you have cantilever brakes, squeeze the brake 
arms together with one hand to create slack in the cable and, with the 
other hand, lift the loose end of the cable out of its pocket. Release the 
breaks and they’ll pop open.
 
✓ V-brakes: If you have V-brakes, pinch together the top of the brake 
arms to loosen the cable. Pull the rubber boot back to expose the cable 
Carefully pull the cable out of the narrow slot in the cable holder, and 
release it to open the brakes
 
✓ Side-pull brakes: For side-pull brakes, look for a small lever on the cali-
per where the cable is attached. Pull the lever upward and release the 
brakes just enough to allow the wheel to pass. In some models, you have 
to look for a button on the lever and push it to release the tension on the 
brakes.
 
Worst case, if you can’t release the brakes to allow the tire to past through the 
brakes, let the air out of the tire; this will give you the clearance needed.
Taking off the wheel
After the brakes are loosened, you’re ready to remove the wheel. To remove 
a wheel, follow these steps:
 
1. Shift the chain to the smallest cog in the back, so that the chain and 
derailleur have more slack and are out of the way.
 
 If you’re removing both wheels, remove the front wheel first, because 
it’s the easier of the two.
 
2. For wheels that use axle nuts: Use the proper size wrench to loosen 
one side slightly and then the other, alternating until the wheel is free.
 
 Avoid loosening one side all at once, because this could lead to prob-
lems with the bike’s hub bearings. If you have two wrenches, you can 
undo both nuts at the same time.
 
3. For quick-release wheels: Pull the lever away from the bike.
 
 The initial release of the lever may be enough to free the front wheel. If 
not, hold the nut opposite the lever with one hand and rotate the lever a 
few times to loosen it.

87
 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
 
All newer bicycles have some type of safety retention device to hold the front 
wheel in the frame, even if the quick release is opened or the axle nuts have 
been loosened. If your front fork has a clip-on type of safety retention device, 
disengage it. If the safety retention device is molded, cast, or machined into 
the front fork dropouts, loosen the tension, adjusting it enough to allow 
removal of the wheel.
If you’ve successfully taken off the front wheel, you’re ready to remove its 
more challenging counterpart — the rear wheel. Unlike the front wheel, 
which practically drops off the bike after you release it, the rear wheel has 
the chain and derailleur wrapped around its cogs. To free it you need to:
 
1. Loosen the nuts or the quick release for the rear wheel in the same 
way as you did for the front.
 
 This time you may need to give the wheel a stiff blow from the rear of 
the wheel toward the front of the bicycle to jar the axle loose.
 
2. Move the wheel away forward and downward from the derailleur to 
let the chain fall off.
 
 If this doesn’t work, you may have to get a little dirty and lift the chain 
off the cog with your hand.
 
Don’t be afraid of the chain, derailleur, and cogs when you remove the rear 
wheel. The chain and rear derailleur will stay attached to the bicycle frame 
and the cogs will stay attached to the rear wheel. You won’t affect any of the 
adjustments.
Removing the tire or at least half of it
The tire is easier to remove if you release any remaining air from the tube. 
You release the air from the tube through the valve. There are two main 
types of valves (see Figure 6-1):
 
✓ Presta valve: A Presta valve is thin and all metal. Many road bikes use 
Presta valves, which can handle greater pressure and leak less than 
Schrader valves.
 
✓ Schrader valve: The Schrader valve is fat, like what you’d see on a car 
tire. Schrader valves are easier to pump up than Presta valves; you can 
fill them up at a gas station.
 
Some bike pumps are designed for either Presta or Schrader valves while 
some are reversible and work with both. If you aren’t sure what you need, ask 
for help in your local bike shop.

88
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 6-1: 
The two 
main types 
of tire 
valves are 
Presta and 
Schrader.
 
 
If you’re putting air in a tire at a gas station, be careful not to overfill it — the 
tire could explode.
If you have a Presta valve, unscrew and press down on the tip of the valve. If 
you have a Schrader valve, insert the tip of a tire lever into the center of the 
valve while squeezing the tire to allow air to escape.
Then, using the tire levers, try to lift one side of the tire off the rim while leav-
ing the other side in place. Here’s how:
 
1. Pinch the tire all the way around the rim to move the edge (or bead) 
of the tire away from the rim.
 
2. Slide the flat end of the first tire lever between the rim and the bead 
of the tire under it.
 
 Make sure to use tire levers, not flathead screwdrivers — screwdrivers 
have sharp edges that can puncture the tire. In a pinch, the handles of 
silverware can work.
 
3. Pull the lever down so that the bead rises up and over the rim.
 
4. Hook the bottom of the lever to a spoke to keep it in place.

89
 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
 
 Some tires are very tight and you’ll need extra room, so don’t hook the 
first tire lever to the spoke until you get the second lever slid under 
the tire.
 
5. A few inches away, repeat steps 2 and 3 with the second tire lever.
 
6. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with the third lever, but instead of hooking the 
lever to a spoke, start dragging the lever around the wheel away from 
the first and second levers (as shown in Figure 6-2).
 
 You should notice the tire becoming looser until the entire side pops off 
the rim.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Using tire 
levers to 
remove 
the tire.
 
 
7. Before removing the inner tube from the wheel, pump it up with a 
little extra air. Later, when you have to look for the puncture, you’ll 
need some air in the tube and it’s easier to pump up the tube while it 
is still on the wheel.
 
8. While the tire is still on the rim, reach under it and pull out the tube.
 
9. When you reach the valve, lift up the tire and pull the valve through 
the rim, being careful not to damage it.

90
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
 Note the position of the tube in relation to the tire so when you find 
the hole in the tube it will be easier to locate the cause (glass, a nail, a 
thorn), if it’s still embedded in the tire.
Finding the puncture
You’ll need to do a little detective work to find the puncture. To track down 
the source of the problem, follow these steps:
 
1. Examine the inner tube by listening for a leak.
 
 If it doesn’t have air, pump it up to a larger shape than round. With the 
additional air pressure, the leak may make a hissing sound as the air 
tries to escape.
 
2. If you’re having trouble listening for the leak, float your finger above 
the surface of the inner tube until you feel the flow of air escaping.
 
 If you’ve narrowed the source of the leak to a small area, but you still 
can’t find the actual hole, apply a small amount of saliva to the tube. 
Bubbles will lead you to the source.
 
 If you don’t want to gross out your riding partners by spitting on your 
tube, you can sometimes find a very small hole or slow leak by holding 
the tube near your lips. The lips are very sensitive and should feel the 
smallest amounts of air leaking out.
 
3. If you’re still having trouble finding the leak, submerge the tube 
under water.
 
 A stream of bubbles will be clearly evident after submerging the tube. 
When you remove the tube from the water, wrap it around your finger at 
the source of the leak or mark it so that you don’t lose the location.
 
In some cases, a hard-to-find leak may be traced to a valve problem. This is 
one situation in which you may want to employ the saliva technique. Apply a 
few drops of saliva to the end of the valve to look for signs of air escaping. For 
a Schrader valve, you can try tightening the valve core. If this doesn’t work, 
you may need to remove the core, put a few drops of oil on the spring, and 
reinstall the core. This technique requires a valve cap with a built-in valve 
core tool or a separate valve core tool, something you can buy at bike shop. If 
the leak is coming from a cracked or cut stem, you’ll have to replace the tube. 
In the case of Presta valves, more likely than a leak is the valve breaking 
(because valves are fragile).
Valve leaks are hard to find when the tube is outside the tire because the 
tube usually has very little air pressure and leaks in the valve usually only 
show up when there is a lot of air pressure (that is, when the tube is sitting 
inside the tire and the tire is inflated to the proper air pressure).

91
 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
Patching the tube
After you’ve identified the source of the leak (see the preceding section), 
follow these steps to patch the tube:
 
1. Lay the tube on a flat surface.
 
2. Using the abrasive paper or metal scraper included in your puncture 
repair kit, rough up the area around the puncture (as shown in Figure 
6-3).
 
 The goal is to remove any dirt or debris from the surface and help the 
patch bond to the tube.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Roughing up 
the tube.
 
 
3. Coat the tube with a thin, even layer of glue from the puncture repair 
kit in an area centered over the puncture and slightly larger than the 
size of the patch (as shown in Figure 6-4).
 
 Allow the glue to dry completely before proceeding.
 
4. Remove the metal backing from the patch (leaving the side covered in 
cellophane alone).
 
 Avoid touching the sticky side of the patch during this process. Doing so 
can weaken the patch’s bonding properties.

5. Apply the patch to the tube, making sure to center it over the punc-
ture (as shown in Figure 6-5).

6. Press the patch firmly and repeatedly in place and, using a tire lever, 
smooth it out to remove any trapped air.
 
 Leave the cellophane in place — it prevents the glue from sticking to the 
tire.
If you’re using glue-free patches, you’ll rough up the tube as in Step 2 and 
apply the patch directly after removing the backing.
 
Glue-free patches are designed to provide a quick fix to get you home and are 
not the long-term solution that the standard glue type patches can be.
Inspecting the tire
After successfully patching or replacing the tube, you’ll want to inspect the tire 
to make sure that there aren’t any sharp objects in it which could re-puncture 
the tube. Here’s how:
 
1. Drag a rag or a biking glove along the inside of the tire, in both 
directions, to determine if there is anything lodged in the tire.
 
 Always drag the rag of the glove in both directions through the inside of 
the tire. Sometimes the object is at an angle and won’t be detected until 
it’s wiped in the opposite direction.
 
2. Visually inspect the inside and outside of the tire, looking for any 
objects wedged inside the tread or cut into the sidewall.
When it’s more than just a flat
When you inspect the tire after repairing the tube, pay attention to any tears 
or rips in the tires. Whatever punctured your tube may have caused damage 
to the structural integrity of the tire.
 
If the tire has a tear, inflating the newly installed tube or riding on it may cause 
the tube to explode through the hole in the tire, giving you a startle that packs 
more punch than a double espresso.
If your tire has any structural damage, you can use a tire boot (a temporary 
patch for tires) to get home. You insert the tire boot between the tube and 
the tire, and the boot prevents the tube from expanding through the opening 
in the tire. Some boots can be fastened to the inside of the tire by adhesive 
backing, and others are designed to be held in place by the pressure of the 
tube pushing against the inside of the tire wall.

94
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Although a boot will enable you to ride on a damaged tire, it’s meant to be tem-
porary, helping you to get home or to a place where you can replace the tire.
To patch a tire with a boot, peel off the backing and adhere the boot to the 
inside of the tire where the tear or cut is located. If the boot doesn’t have 
adhesive, you have to wrap the boot around the slightly inflated tube at the 
location of the damage, knowing that, after the tube is fully inflated, the boot 
will be held in place.
 
In an emergency, you can use a dollar bill the same way you would a tire boot. 
Dollar bills are surprisingly strong. Dennis always keeps at lease one in his 
seat bag.
Ready to Roll!
At this point, you should have a patched or replaced tube, a tire free of 
debris, and the enthusiasm of knowing that this pit stop is just about over. 
After you finish the final steps of putting the tire and tube back on the wheel, 
inflating the tube, and the attaching the wheel to the bike, you’re ready to 
roll! We cover these final steps in this section.
Putting on the tube and tire
To reinstall the tube and the tire on the wheel, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the wheel with the valve hole facing upward.
 
2. Pull back the tire and insert the valve of the tube, partially inflated 
(enough to give it its shape), into the hole.
 
3. Working your way around the tire, tuck the tube up into the tire and 
on the rim being careful not to twist it.
 
4. Pinch together the sides of the tire in order to lift the other half of the 
tire bead onto the rim.
 
 Try to use your hands to put the tire on the rim. Using the tire levers 
could re-puncture the tube you just worked so hard to repair or replace.
 
 When you finish this step half of the tire should be pushed over the rim.
 
5. Start with the valve in the bottom, or 6 o’clock position, and begin 
working your hands away from each other around the wheel and 
pushing down on the bead with your thumbs or other fingers.

95
 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
 
6. When your hands get closer together at the top, or the 12 o’clock posi-
tion, squeeze with as much force as you can muster.
 
 You should be able to pop the final portion of the bead into place (as 
shown in Figure 6-6).
 
Figure 6-6: 
Putting the 
tire back on 
the rim.
 
 
Sometimes the tire is very tight when you get near the top. If this happens, you 
need to let all the air back out of the tube and start again with your hands at 
the bottom, or 6 o’clock position, making sure the tire is seated down inside 
the lip of the rim. Pull the last section of tread with your palms. Rotate the 
wheel and, from the back, use both hands to pull up repeatedly until the bead 
snaps in.
 
If you must use a tire lever for the last step, be careful not to pinch the tube 
against the rim, or you could be back to square one. Either way, it’s time to 
put a smile on your face. You’re almost finished and everything is downhill 
from here.
Inspect the tire to make sure that the tube is not sticking out from under it. 
As a precautionary step, push the valve up into the tire to make sure that the 
part of the tube surrounding the value is not pinned against the rim and then 
pull it back down to inflate. If everything looks good, begin to inflate the tube 
according to the pounds per square inch (PSI) rating, marked on the side-
wall of the tire. As you pump it up, examine the tire to make sure the tube is 

96
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
expanding consistently within the tire and isn’t bulging in any areas. If the 
tube isn’t expanding consistently or is bulging, the tube may be twisted or 
pinched by the tire and need to be reinstalled.
Attaching the wheel
To attach the wheel, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Confirm that the brakes have been released and there is space for the 
wheel to pass between them.
 
2. If you’re attaching the front wheel, position the wheel hub within the 
frame’s fork and slide it into place.
 
 If you have a quick-release hub, the quick release will be loose in the 
open position. It starts to get snug when the lever is pointed straight out 
away from the bicycle, and very tight when pivoted into the closed posi-
tion. You can adjust the tension for the closed position with the hand-
turn nut on the opposite end of the quick-release skewer.
 
 Never use the lever as a wing nut and crank it to tighten the quick 
release. Doing so won’t result in sufficient force to hold the wheel to the 
fork. The lever must be closed for the cam mechanism to securely clamp 
down on the fork.
 
 If you don’t have a quick release, begin by tightening the axle nuts on 
both sides of the hub a little at a time until both are securely in place.
 
3. If you’re attaching the rear wheel, make sure the right-hand shifter 
is placed into the highest gear, the gear that moves the chain farthest 
away from the bike and onto the smallest cog.
 
4. Maneuver the wheel into place so that the top part of the chain just 
above the derailleur falls onto the smallest sprocket.
 
 To facilitate this step, push the derailleur arm down and pull the cogs in 
between the loop.
 
5. With the chain sitting on the smallest cog (which is the cog it was on 
when you removed the wheel), slide the wheel into place into the rear 
dropout part of the frame.
 
6. Use the instructions in Step 2 to fasten the quick release or the axle nuts.
Congratulations! Your tire and tube should be in good shape and your flat 
tire a soon-to-be distant memory. After doing this a few times, you’ll find 
that fixing a flat will be little more than a five- to ten-minute pit stop that will 
barely give your riding partner time to return from a restroom break.

 Chapter 6: Burning Rubber: Tires and Tubes
Coming to a screeching halt: When 
you get another flat right away
For those of us who have had the excruciatingly frustrating experience of get-
ting a flat five minutes after repairing the first one, we know there are many 
more descriptive and colorful words come to mind than our publisher will let 
us print in this book.
If a flat tire strikes twice consider the possible causes:
 
✓ More than one puncture is in the tube and you only patched one of them.
 
✓ A shard of glass or some sharp object is hidden in the tire and has re-
punctured the tube.
 
✓ When you reinstalled the tube, part of it was pinched between the rim 
and the tire.
The solution is to take a deep breath and repeat the process, being extra 
vigilant when finding the puncture, inspecting the tire, and installing the tube.
Of course, there is always the chance that you did everything perfectly the 
first time and it just so happened that you had the incredibly bad luck of 
running into a second sharp object on the road. The good thing is that, over 
time, the odds even out, and the next time you’ll be the one taking the bath-
room break while your riding partner is on her knees with tube in hand.
A Pound of Cure: Preventing a Flat
The obvious choice of any bike rider is to avoid flats. Although this might be 
impossible for any wheel system that uses tubes, prevention is the next best 
option. To help prevent flat tires, proper maintenance is key:
 
✓ Keep your tires inflated to the proper pressure as indicated on the side 
of the tire.
 
✓ Replace tires at the first sign of worn tread or deteriorating sidewalls.
 
✓ Replace tubes that have already been patched more than a dozen times.
 
✓ Inspect tire tread for objects stuck in the tread that may cause a puncture.
 
If you’re willing to spend a little extra money to prevent punctures, con-
sider investing in Kevlar-reinforced tires. The composite fibers that make 
up Kevlar are strong enough to resist punctures that would normally occur 
from contact with sharp objects. Kevlar tires typically run about $15 to $20 
more than regular tires.

98
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
If Kevlar tires aren’t in your budget, try tire liners, which are made of strong, 
lightweight fibers and line the inside of the tire to provide extra protection to 
the tube. Other options are thorn-resistant tubes and tubes with flat sealant 
that fills small holes from the inside without the rider even knowing he’s had 
a puncture.
 
Even if you take all the preventive steps mentioned in this section, you’re still 
likely to get an occasional flat. Once, on a trip from Ireland to Italy with a heav-
ily loaded bike, Dennis went three months without a single flat. A few months 
later, on a trip in the United States, he was pulling his hair out on the side of 
the road after five flats in one week. Go figure!
If you keep a patch kit, tire levers, pump, and spare tube with you while you 
bike and you practice the steps described in this chapter, the chances are 
good that you’ll be able to fix a flat and be back on your bike quicker than 
your partner can finish off a PowerBar. This will give you the confidence to 
take long, worry-free bike rides and save you from the embarrassment of 
having to ask another biker to show you how to change a flat or from walking 
your bike home.

Y
ou can’t think about caring for your bike without making the wheels a 
big part of the plan. Wheels that spin straight, round, true, and smooth, 
on properly inflated tires, greatly contribute to the comfort of a bike ride. 
Wheels that run rough on tires inflated to the wrong level can, at the very 
least, take the fun out of a ride and, at worst, be downright dangerous.
In this chapter, we fill you in on the basics of maintaining and repairing the 
wheels of your bike. Here, you find out how to inspect your wheels to make 
sure they’re in good working order. If your wheels aren’t working properly, 
we give you steps to take to repair them, including overhauling the hubs and 
truing the spokes.
The Spin on Wheels
If wheels are made of quality material, are built with properly tensioned 
spokes, and use tires inflated to the correct pounds per square inch (PSI), 
they should last a long time and not need repair or service other than keep-
ing the hubs lubrications and in good working condition.
In this section, we fill you in on how to care for your wheels, keep them in 
good working order, and handle problems if they arise. We also give you the 
skinny on shopping for new wheels, in case you need to replace one.

100
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Shopping for new wheels
Wheels are measured according to their diameter and width. If you’re shop-
ping for wheels, you might see a number like 700C x 19. The first number is 
the diameter of the wheel in millimeters; the second is the width.
 
Sometimes manufacturers uses the English-American standard and list the 
numbers in inches (for example, 26 x 1.9). In other cases, manufacturers write 
one number in inches and the other in millimeters (for example, 26 x 19).
Knowing the size of a wheel is important because not all wheels will fit a 
bike and not all tires will fit a wheel. The diameter determines what wheel 
will work with your bike. The forks on a bike are designed to use wheels of a 
certain size. If the diameter is too large, the wheel won’t fit on the bike. If the 
diameter is too small, the brakes won’t align properly with the rim.
The width impacts the tires you can use. Wider rims are usually found on 
mountain bikes, which use thick tires with heavier tread. Narrower rims are 
found on road bikes, which use thin tires.
Another consideration when buying wheels for your bike is the width of the 
hubs — the distance as measured between the two locknuts. It should match 
up with the distance between the dropouts in the forks and the rear frame 
dropouts.
 
Many quick-release hubs are thicker than their nutted, solid-axle counterparts. 
If your bike is designed with traditional hub nuts, be sure to test new wheels if 
they use a quick-release axle — otherwise, you may find that they don’t fit.
Other than size, another consideration when purchasing a wheel is whether 
it supports a clincher tire or tubular tire:
 
✓ Clincher tires are what you find on most bikes today. A clincher com-
bines a tire (which is secured on the rim by two beads, or outer edges, 
that tuck or clinch inside the rim) and an inner tube (which is enclosed 
by the tire). To protect the tube from the spoke holes, rim tape or some 
sort of material is used to line the inside of the rim next to the tube.
 
✓ Tubular tires are found mostly on racing bikes. They consist of a tire 
material that is sewn together and then attached to the rim with adhesive. 
If you have a flat, changing a tubular tire is more work, but tubular tires 
are safer than clinchers if your flat occurs when you’re riding at a high 
speed, because they’re less likely to come off the rim while you’re riding.
 
Some downhill mountain bikes are starting to use a new style of rim and tire 
combination that doesn’t use tubes. These are more durable and hold up 
better to the extreme conditions of mountain biking, but they aren’t ideal for 
every rider because they’re very expensive and hard to work with.

101
 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
Caring for your wheels
In order to maintain proper braking, you should keep your wheels clean 
and grease-free. Regular washings with soap and water will keep grime from 
building up. If you have trouble removing residue, try using a solvent and a 
Brillo pad to clean the rims. Use rubbing alcohol to finish the cleaning and 
remove all solvents and residue off the sides of the rims.
 
Make sure you keep the solvent away from the tire — solvent will cause the 
tire to deteriorate.
Another aspect of care for your wheels is keeping the hubs properly lubri-
cated. At least once a year, overhaul the hubs. Most hubs today have rubber 
seals that keep a lot of contaminants out of the bearings. If your hubs don’t 
have rubber seals or you’re riding in dusty, rainy, or muddy conditions, you’ll 
need to overhaul your hubs and replace the grease more often.
 
You can do a number of things to extend the life of your wheels and keep them 
in good working order:
 
✓ Properly inflate your tires. Tires act as the primary suspension for a 
bike. They cushion the wheel from blows and grip the road as you ride. 
The most important thing you can do to protect your rims is to keep 
your tires inflated to the psi indicated on the side of the tires. The num-
ber-one cause of damaged rims is under-inflated tires. Keep your tires 
at the right pressure and, when you hit the next pothole or rock in the 
road, you’ll have a good chance of your wheel surviving it intact. Plus, 
you’ll have the added benefit of not having to expend as much energy to 
pedal when your bicycle has properly inflated tires.
 
✓ Make sure your spokes are properly tensioned. Wheels with spokes 
that are tensioned too loosely will have a shorter lifespan and could be 
dangerous. Loose spokes flex more than tense spokes do, so they fatigue 
more and are more likely to break. If several spokes give out, the wheel 
could collapse while you’re riding. A wheel with loose spokes will also 
flex and wobble, causing reduced steering control. At the same time, the 
answer to loose spokes is not to randomly or overtighten them. A wheel 
with spokes that over-tensioned can be dangerous as well. A wheel has a 
high risk of bending like a pretzel with under- or over-tensioned spokes.
 
 You want a wheel with spokes that are tight enough that they don’t work 
their way loose while you ride. Frequently pluck the spokes of your 
wheel. Spokes of the same tension will make a similar sound, allowing 
you to quickly identify which ones are loose.
 
✓ Make sure you have the right wheels. Just as important as inflating your 
tires and properly tensioning your spokes is to pair the right wheels and 
tires with the type of bike and style of riding you engage in. For example, 
if you’re going off-road, you should have mountain-bike wheels and tires, 

102
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
which are designed to absorb the impact of riding on a trail and other 
rough surfaces. For touring, you’ll want wheels with a greater number of 
spokes in order to support the weight of loaded pannier bags.
 
 Talk to the staff at your local bike shop and let them know what kind of 
riding you’re planning on doing. They can match you up with the right 
wheels.
 
 Many riders keep an extra pair of wheels in their garage for specific pur-
poses. If they’re hitting the trail, they can take off and exchange their 
road wheels for a mountain-bike pair.
 
 Wheel sets are one of the best ways to upgrade your bike. If you have a 
racing bike, new lightweight wheels with fewer spokes can greatly 
improve performance. If you’re starting to tour, some road riders con-
vert to 650B wheels in order to use wider, touring-type tires.
 
✓ Take care when you ride. The way you ride can have a significant 
impact on the life of your tires. Avoid making contact with objects in 
the road as much as possible. If you need to cross a curb, think about 
getting off your bike and lifting it over the curb. If you do have to impact 
something with your tires, lift yourself off the seat, bend your knees and 
elbows, and, using your legs and arms as shock absorbers, let your bike 
rise up over the object.
Inspecting the wheels for problems
Wheels are an amazing work of design. They require spokes that are properly 
calibrated in order to spin straight and smoothly. If any of the spokes are 
improperly tensioned, your wheel could come out of alignment or become 
unstable. Before you ride, take a moment to do a few checks to inspect your 
wheels:
 
✓ Give the wheel a spin — it should continue to rotate smoothly for a 
period of time. It’s normal for the rear wheel to not spin as long as the 
front because of the drag of the cassette/freewheel. You shouldn’t hear 
any noises other than the rear cassette/freewheel.
 
✓ Grab the wheel with one hand and the frame with the other, and 
try moving the wheel from side to side. If it moves side to side, the 
hubs may be loose and in need of adjustment or overhaul. (See the 
“Overhauling the hubs” and “Adjusting a hub” sections, later in this 
chapter.)
 
✓ Spin the wheel and keep your eye fixated on the brake; watch the rim 
as it passes by. If it is not perfectly centered, it may need to be trued. 
(See the “Truing a wheel” section, later in this chapter.)

103
 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
✓ Pluck the spokes of the wheel and listen to the sounds they make. 
They should make a similar sound if they have the same tension. If one 
feels loose or makes a unique sound, it may need to be tightened.
 
✓ Check the PSI in both tires with an air pressure gauge. Don’t go by the 
feel of your tires — take the time to test them with a pressure gauge.
 
✓ Inspect the tread depth and condition of the tires sidewalls, looking 
for dry rot, deformities, or slices from road debris.
 
Often, tire sidewalls start to corrode or oxidize, vastly reducing their integrity 
and lifespan. Consider occasionally applying Armor All or similar vinyl/rubber 
protection to the sidewalls using a clean rag.
Taking off a wheel
Before you can remove a wheel, you need to loosen the brakes. Brakes are 
designed to grip the rims, which are narrower than the tires, so their position 
prevents the wheel from being removed.
Most brakes are designed with a mechanism to allow for a quick release of 
the cable that holds the brake adjustment in place. The way in which you’ll 
detach the cable may vary depending on what type of brakes your bike has. 
On some brakes, such as cantilevers, you pull the end of the cable out of the 
brake arm.
In most cases, you need to pinch the brakes together to create slack in the 
cable, enabling you to lift the end of the cable out of the brake arm. After you 
remove the cable and release the brakes, the brakes will spring open. Here’s 
how to do this for the two main types of brakes:
 
✓ If you have V brakes, you’ll need to pull back on the rubber boot of an 
L-shaped piece to expose the cable. Pull the cable out of the narrow slot 
in the cable holder and release it to open the brakes.
 
✓ If you have side-pull brakes, there will be a small lever on the brake 
where the cable is attached. Move the lever to the open position and the 
brakes will spread apart. In some cases, there may be a button instead of 
a lever; if you have a button, push it to release the tension on the brakes.
 
Some bikes have the quick-release mechanism built into the brake lever. If you 
can’t find it on the brakes, look here.
If you can’t figure out how to release the brakes, you can always let the air 
out of the tires. Sometimes this will provide enough clearance between the 
brakes to remove the tires.

104
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
After you’ve released the brakes, follow these steps to remove the front 
wheel (start with the front wheel — it’s the easier of the two):
 
✓ If your wheel uses hub nuts or bolts, use a wrench to loosen the axle 
(as shown in Figure 7-1). Start with one nut, loosen it slightly, and move 
to the other nut, switching back and forth until you can free the wheel.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Removing a 
wheel with 
bolts.
 
 
 Avoid loosening one side all at once because this could lead to problems 
with the bike’s hub bearings. Alternatively, if you have two wrenches, 
you can undo both nuts at the same time.
 
✓ In place of bolts, many bikes these days are manufactured with a 
quick release which are loosened by opening the lever on the side 
of the wheel hub. If your wheel has a quick release, open the lever. 
When you release the lever the axle may loosen enough to remove the 
front wheel. If it doesn’t, hold the nut opposite the lever with one hand 
and rotate the lever a few times to loosen it (as shown in Figure 7-2). The 
quick-release skewer is shown in Figure 7-3.
 
 Modern bikes are designed with a safety retention device built into the 
dropout which holds the wheel in place even when the quick-release 
lever is loosened. There are many different designs, so inspect yours 
and/or refer to your owner’s manual. In order to release the wheel, you 
have to lift and maneuver the wheel off the dropouts of the frame.

106
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Unlike the front wheel, which drops off as soon as the axle is loosened, the 
rear wheel requires another step or two to remove it because of the chain 
and derailleur being attached to it. Here’s how to remove the rear wheel:
 
1. Shift to the smallest cog on the rear, making the chain more slack.
 
2. Loosen the nuts or the quick release for the rear wheel in the same 
manner as you did for the front.
 
3. To remove the wheel, you may have to give it a slight blow to knock it 
loose from the frame.
 
4. When it comes loose, move the wheel away from the derailleur (for-
ward and down) to let the chain fall off.
 
Don’t be afraid of the rear wheel. The chain and rear derailleur stay on the 
bicycle and, by removing the rear wheel, you won’t effect any of the gear 
adjustments. In some cases, you may have to use your hand to lift the chain 
off the cogs or pull back the derailleur from the wheel in order to slack the 
chain from the cogs.
Repairing dents in the rim
Even if you keep your tires properly inflated and try to avoid obstacles in the 
road, at some point, if you ride enough miles, you’re bound to hit something 
that will cause a dent in the rim. If this happens to you, don’t despair. You 
don’t necessarily have to replace the wheel. Try these steps:
 
✓ Use an adjustable wrench on the lip of the rim as a lever. Work little 
by little on the dent, being careful not to bend the rim too much in the 
other direction.
 
✓ Put the rim into a vise. Tightening the vise sometimes will squeeze the 
dent out of the rim.
 
✓ In the case of a dent on both sides of the rim, try laying the rim on a flat 
surface like a block of wood. Using a mallet, try flattening out one dent 
with a sharp blow. Turn the rim over and do the same to the other side.
Installing the front and rear wheels
Installing the front and rear wheels is a fairly simple process but one that 
should not be taken lightly. The wheels must sit firmly in the frame’s front 
and rear dropouts. If you have anything less than a tight fit, you could be risk-
ing the chance of a wheel coming loose, something that would be potentially 
disastrous if you were biking. Follow these steps and you’ll be in good shape:

107
 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
1. Make sure that the brakes are open and there is room for the wheel 
to pass.
 
2. For the front wheel, align the hub with the dropouts in the fork and 
slide the wheel into place.
 
• If you have a quick-release hub, you may need to adjust the nut on 
the opposite side of the wheel before the quick-release lever can 
be closed. Be sure not to use the lever to crank the quick release 
to a tight position. Instead, turn the nut opposite the lever until it’s 
almost tight and then close the quick-release lever.
 
 When you close the quick-release lever, the lever part should be 
loose in the open position, start to snug when sticking straight out 
away from the frame, and tighten fully when closed. It should 
require enough force that it leaves an indentation on your hand. 
Any looser and it may not be secure.
 
• For traditional hubs with nuts, begin by tightening the axle nuts, alter-
nating side to side a little at a time until both are securely in place.
 
3. For the rear wheel, start by making sure the right hand shifter is 
placed into the highest gear.
 
 Hold the rear derailleur from the metal tab at the bottom pulley in order 
to open up the chain into a large loop. Make sure the rear cassette goes 
into the middle of this loop as you install it.
 
4. Maneuver the wheel into place so that the top part of the chain just 
above the derailleur falls onto the smallest sprocket.
 
5. With the chain sitting on the smallest cog, which is the cog it was on 
when you removed the wheel sprocket, slide the wheel into place into 
the rear dropout part of the frame.
 
6. Use the same procedures as you did for the front wheel to fasten the 
quick release or the axle nuts.
Hubba-Hubba: Working on the Hubs
Hubs have to hold up under significant pressure and, over time, water, dirt, 
and grime work their way into the bearings and can cause this pressure to 
wear them out. The best solution for keeping them in good working order is 
to perform an overhaul of the hubs at least once a year as part of your annual 
service — more often if you ride a lot or in wet or muddy conditions.
Hubs are designed to allow the wheel to effortlessly spin around an axle. 
Bearings inside the hub reduce friction as the axle rotates. If you hear a 
grinding sound or the wheel doesn’t rotate smoothly, it may mean that the 
hub is too tight and should be adjusted or that an overhaul is in order. If you 
can wiggle the axle back and forth, this may mean that the hub is too loose.

108
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
There are two main styles of hubs:
 
✓ Cup-and-cone (see Figure 7-4): In the cup-and-cone style, loose ball bear-
ings sit in smooth cup and are held in place by a cone. The cone and cup 
together create a race, in which the bearings can move around the axle 
in a circle with minimal friction. Washers are used to properly space the 
cone and cup and a locknut holds everything in place on the axle.
 
✓ Sealed bearing: The sealed-bearing hub is popular on many midrange 
to high-end bikes. This style of hub also has a an axle, bearings, race, 
and cone, but they’re assembled as a unit and sealed when they’re 
manufactured to improve their ability to keep water and dirt away from 
the bearings. Some sealed-bearing hubs can be serviced; others need to 
be replaced when they give out. The good thing is that they last much 
longer than cup-and-cone hubs.
 
Figure 7-4: 
A cup-and-
cone hub.
 
 
Don’t be fooled by the label sealed mechanism. These are standard cup-and-
cone-style bearings, except they have a rubber seal to help keep contaminates 
out. They aren’t true sealed bearings.
Overhauling the hubs
Well-functioning hubs are critical for smooth spinning wheels and a comfort-
able ride. To keep your hubs in the best possible shape, plan on overhauling 
the hubs at least once a year. If you’re lucky enough to have sealed-bearing 
hubs you’re off the hook; most of these will last many years without any ser-
vice. If you have cup and cone hubs, follow these steps:
 
1. If you have a quick-release skewer, remove it from the wheel. If there 
are nuts on the hub remove them with a wrench, alternating side to 
side as you loosen.

109
 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
2. Using a cone wrench and a second standard wrench, make sure the 
cone and locknut are tight against each other on one side of the hub.
 
3. On the other side of the hub, using a cone wrench, secure the cone in 
place while you loosen the locknut in a counterclockwise direction on 
the same side of the hub (see Figure 7-5).
 
 It will usually require some force to initiate movement in the locknut. 
If you’re working on a hub with a freewheel, remove the freewheel (see 
Chapter 11 for instructions). If you have a cassette hub, work on the side 
opposite the cassette.
 
4. Remove the locknut, washers, and cone from the axle, keeping them 
in order as you remove them.
 
5. Hold a towel or cup under the hub as you pull out the axle, because 
some bearings may fall out.
 
 Figure 7-6 illustrates the removal of an axle.
 
 Leave the cone, washers, and locknut in place on the other side of the 
axle. This will make reassembly easier.
 
6. Using a screwdriver, remove the bearings from both sides of the hub 
(see Figure 7-7).
 
 A magnetic screwdriver makes bearing retrieval easier, although a 
screwdriver tipped with grease will work. Another trick is to push them 
down through the center of the hub and out the other side.

 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
 Count the bearings in the hub. Some hubs are designed for ten bearings 
in the front and nine in the back. Because you’ll probably want to 
replace the bearings with new ones (they’re cheap), you’ll want to know 
how many to purchase (and how many to use for reassembly).
 
7. After the bearings are removed, wipe the inside of the hub shell with 
a cloth and then use a degreaser to clean the cups.
 
 Examine the cups for wear. If they have dents in the surface, you may 
need to replace the entire hub.
 
8. Clean the axle, nuts, and cones by removing dirt and grime from the 
threads.
 
 Examine them for signs of wear and tear. If you roll the axle across a flat 
surface and it wobbles, it may be bent and need replacing.
 
9. Wipe down the dust seals with a cloth.
 
 If they’re especially dirty, you can pop them off using a screwdriver for 
leverage.
 
10. After cleaning all parts, allow them to dry thoroughly before 
reassembly.
Reassembling the hubs
When you’re all done overhauling the hubs, it’s time to reassemble them. To 
reassemble the hubs, follow these steps:
 
1. If you removed the dust seals, press them back into place.
 
2. Apply a fresh layer of grease to each of the cups (as shown in Figure 7-8).
 
 The general rule is to use enough grease so that a bearing will be cov-
ered halfway when placed in the cup.
 
3. Using tweezers or pliers, place half the bearings in one cup, spreading 
them out evenly across the cup (as shown in Figure 7-9).
 
 The bearings should be held in place temporarily by the grease. Make 
sure there is at least a 1mm gap between all the bearings placed in the 
cup. If the bearings are too tight, remove one, so that each bearing has a 
few microns of elbow room.
 
4. Grease the axle and slide it halfway into the hub to hold the bearings 
in place while you fill the other cone with bearings.
 
 Make sure that no bearings fall out during this procedure.

 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
5. While you’re holding the axle with one hand, place the other half of 
the bearings into the other cup.
 
 After you’ve finished with all the bearings, slide the axle the rest of the 
way through.
 
6. Thread the cone onto the axle until it begins to press against the bear-
ings in a secure fashion.
 
 Twist the axle to ensure that the bearings are snug and in place.
 
7. Slide the washers and any spacers on in the axle in the correct order.
 
8. Thread the locknut onto the axle by hand (as shown in Figure 7-10) 
and, after it tightens, use a wrench to tighten it further while holding 
the cone in place with a cone wrench.
 
 You don’t want to tighten the cone, because it could press forcefully 
against the bearings and damage them.
 
 When tightening the locknut, leave a slight amount of play in the axle so 
that it can accept the additional force from the tightening of the quick-
release lever.
 
9. Adjust the tightness of the hubs by following the procedure in the 
next section.
 
 Figure 7-11 shows an example of tightening the cones in the hub.

Attaching 
the locknut.

Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 7-11: 
Tightening 
the cones.
 
Adjusting a hub
The cones on a hub cannot be too loose or too tight — they need to be just 
right. What does that mean exactly? The tightness should be such that there 
is little to no play in the hub, but the axle rotates freely. If you have trouble 
finding the right point between too loose and too tight, err on the side of 
being slightly loose.
To adjust the tightness of a hub, you need a wrench for the axle locknuts and 
a cone wrench to fit the cone. To tighten the hub, hold the cone in place with 
the cone wrench and tighten the locknut with your other wrench. Only the 
locknut should move; if the cone is moving, it could press against the bear-
ings and damage them. To loosen the hub, loosen the locknut.
 
If only a small adjustment is needed in the hub, you can adjust the locknut and 
cone on just one side of the bike.
 
Whenever you adjust the hubs of a wheel that uses quick releases, leave the 
cones just a little loose. Tightening the quick release will apply extra pressure 
to the bearings and take that little wiggle out when clamped in the frame. Be 
sure to check the adjustment once the wheel is clamped into the bike.

I Spoke Too Soon: Working on the Spokes
Wheels are an amazing feat of engineering — a handful of thin spokes woven 
together to provide enough structural integrity to support the weight of a 
rider going across various types of surfaces. To accomplish this feat, the 
spokes must be laced to the wheel in just the right pattern and tensioned 
evenly across the wheel. This aspect makes working on spokes a slightly 
complicated affair for a beginner. But with some practice, you can master 
some basic techniques — and that’s what this section is about.
Replacing a spoke
Replacing a spoke is manageable and a good place to get started. If you do 
end up needing to replace a broken spoke, take it with you to your bike store 
so that you can replace it with another spoke of the same size and width.
 
Keep in mind that the spokes on your wheels are probably of different sizes. In 
many cases, front-wheel spokes are not the same length as rear-wheel spokes. 
The same is likely true for spokes on the right side of the wheel hub versus the 
left side.
Here’s how to replace a spoke:
 
1. Insert the new spoke into the spoke hole from the broken spoke you 
removed from the hub.
 
 You may need to remove the wheel from the bike to perform this proce-
dure (see “Taking off a wheel,” earlier in this chapter).
 
2. Weave the spoke through the other spokes, following the same pattern, 
crossing and interweaving the same number of spokes as the others.
 
3. If the old nipple (the nut part that the spoke threads into) is undam-
aged and still in place, thread the end of the new spoke into it.
 
 If the nipple is damaged, you’ll need to remove the tire, tube, and rim 
tape to replace the damaged nipple with a new one.
 
4. So that you don’t lose track of the spoke, mark it with a piece of tape 
or string.
 
5. Using a spoke wrench, tighten the spoke to the same tension as the 
other spokes.
 
6. To finish the procedure, true the rest of the wheel (see the following 
section).

Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Truing a wheel
Although wheel truing is an activity that takes time and practice to master, 
some basic wheel truing is possible for the casual biker. If you have a wheel 
that’s so out of true that it needs to be rebuilt, you probably should leave 
the job to your local bike shop. But if the wheel just has a slight wobble and 
needs a little tweaking, you may want to consider doing it yourself.
 
If the rim is bent, simple truing won’t suffice — the rim will have to be repaired.
Here are the steps for truing a wheel when there are only minor imperfec-
tions in the wheel:
 
1. Remove the tire, tube, and rim strip from the rim.
 
 For some truing stands, you can leave the tire, tube, and rim strip on 
the rim, although we find that we get the best results when working only 
with the rim.
 
2. Secure the wheel in a truing stand (as shown in Figure 7-12) if you 
have one; otherwise, you can keep the wheel on the bike.
 
 If you have to true the wheel while it’s attached to the bike, use a bike 
stand to support the bike. Other options are to hang the bike from the 
ceiling or to turn the bike upside down on its handlebars.
 
Figure 7-12: 
Using a 
truing stand
 

117
 Chapter 7: Hugging the Curb: The Wheels
 
3. Before you begin spinning the wheel, check it for loose or damaged 
spokes (as shown in Figure 7-13).
 
4. Make sure the wheel rim is 1/4 inch away from the calipers in the 
truing stand or the brakes on the bike.
 
5. Give the wheel a gentle spin and keep your eye on the calipers (or 
brakes).
 
 You’ll be able to identify wobbles in the rim by where the wheel comes 
close to or comes in contact with the brakes.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Feeling for 
loose areas.
 
 
6. If the rim comes in contact on one side, use a spoke wrench to tighten 
the nipples of the spokes that come from the opposite hub and loosen 
those that come from the hub on the same side.
 
 Loosen and tighten in small increments, around a quarter of a turn each 
time. Start in the middle of each wobble and work your way outwards 
from the center. Decrease the amount for each turn the farther away you 
move from the center. (Figure 7-14 demonstrates using a spoke wrench.)
 
 Spoke nipples come in various sizes. Be sure to check the size of your 
spokes before you buy a spoke wrench.

118
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 7-14: 
Using a 
spoke 
wrench.
 
 
 To tighten a spoke at the bottom of the wheel, turn the nipple in a coun-
terclockwise direction. When the spoke is at the top of the wheel, the 
change of position makes it appear as if it’s in a clockwise direction.
 
7. After the wobble has been reduced, you can tighten the calipers to 
find any smaller wobbles.
 
 As the wobbles become smaller, reduce the amount by which you turn 
the spoke wrench.
 
 Don’t worry about eliminating all the wobble of a rim. It’s more impor-
tant to have evenly tensioned spokes than to have a rim without a 
wobble.
 
 If you can’ t get the rim perfectly straight, loosen and adjust your brakes 
to make them farther away from the rim so they don’t rub. If these 
brakes are no longer satisfactorily strong, however, you may need to 
replace the rim/wheel.

W
hen Dennis was a kid, one of his bikes had a braking system that 
required him to use his foot to stop the pedals and cranks from rotat-
ing forward in order to come to a halt. The advantage of this design was that 
he could look cool by skidding out when he needed to stop the bike.
Somewhere between then and now, skidding out has lost its appeal, and odds 
are, you’re less concerned with impressing your friends than you are with 
stopping safely. Fortunately, today’s bikes have braking systems that can 
consistently stop the momentum of the bike and the rider’s weight with little 
more than a firm squeeze of the brake levers.
Although brakes designs have evolved to be highly reliable when it comes 
to stopping a bike, this doesn’t mean that you should take them for granted. 
Proper maintenance and inspection of your brakes will increase the chances 
that, if you round that next turn too fast or if someone backs his car out in 
front of you without looking, you won’t have to make one giant skid mark.
We start this chapter with a quick overview of the different types of brakes 
on the market today. Then we narrow our discussion, focusing on the most 
popular type of brakes — rim brakes — and the various styles of rim brakes. 
We tell you how to remove and install brakes and brake pads, make adjust-
ments to your brakes, and address common braking issues.

120
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Types of Brakes
There are three major categories of braking systems on modern bikes:
 
✓ Rim brakes: When you squeeze the brake levers of rim brakes, the brake 
cables pull on one or both brake arms, which causes the rubber brake pads 
to come in contact with the wheel rims and slow the bike down. The ben-
efits of rim brakes are that they’re cheap and relatively easy to maintain, 
and they have a lot of stopping force. The drawback is that they don’t work 
well in wet or muddy conditions and they can wear out quickly.
 
 The three popular models of rim brakes are:
 
• Cantilever brakes: Cantilever brakes (see Figure 8-1) have short, 
L-shaped brake arms that bolt to the frame and are connected by a 
straddle cable, which looks like an upside-down Y. They’re mounted 
on two pivots, one on each side of the wheel. The pivots (bosses) 
are set close to the wheel, which increases their mechanical advan-
tage. Cantilever brakes have very good braking power. They’re com-
monly found on road bikes, mountain bikes, and touring bikes.
 
• V-brakes: V-brakes (see Figure 8-2) are sometimes referred to as 
linear-pull or direct-pull brakes. The brake arms are at nearly a 
90-degree angle to the brake pads. V-brakes are mounted on two 
pivots on the frame, one on each side of the wheel. The longer 
arms give V-brakes improved leverage and greater stopping power. 
They’re commonly found on mountain bikes and hybrid bikes.
 
• Center-mount brakes: With center-mount brakes (see Figure 8-3), 
the brake cable attaches to one of the brake arms. The brake arms 
are together as one unit and mounted to a single pivot, which 
sits above the wheel. (In the double-pivot variety, there are two 
pivots — one on each side of the wheel — but still only one center 
mounting bolt.) The brake pads are at the bottom of the arms. 
Center-mount brakes don’t provide as much power as V-brakes 
or cantilevers. They’re commonly found on road bikes and lower-
price bikes.
 
✓ Disk brakes: Squeezing the brake levers on disc brakes (see Figure 8-4) 
causes the brake pads to squeeze against a metal disc that surrounds 
the hub. There are two main types of disc brakes — mechanical and 
hydraulic. Mechanical disc brakes utilize a cable to actuate the brake 
pads, whereas hydraulic brakes use a brake fluid pushed down by a 
piston through a brake line to generate braking power. Both types 
work well in both dry and wet conditions, and they’re quite responsive, 
requiring less effort from the hand when breaking. The advantage of disk 

121
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
brakes is they don’t heat up the rim on long descents, causing the tire 
pressure to increase and possibly blow out. Also, they don’t wear out 
the sidewall of a thin and lightweight alloy rim. The disadvantage of disk 
brakes is that they’re usually heavier, cost more, and require a hub that 
can accept a disk. Disk brakes are commonly found on mountain bikes.
 
✓ Hub brakes: Sometimes called drum brakes, hub brakes are similar 
to disk brakes except the brake pads are pushed outward against the 
inside of a cylindrical drum inside the hub. The fact that they’re on the 
inside of the hub means they aren’t affected by wet, muddy, or dusty 
conditions. However, they are the heaviest of all the brakes. They’re 
found on some tandem bikes.

Inspecting the Brakes
To ensure that your brakes are in good working order before you set off on 
your next ride, follow these steps to inspect them:
 
1. Examine the brake pads for excessive wear.
 
 If they’re worn down such that the grooves in the pads are not visible, 
they should be replaced.
 
 You may notice uneven wearing of the brake pads, which is usually 
caused by improperly fitted brake pads that aren’t parallel and contact 
the rim unevenly. When this happens, a curved ridge forms in the brake 
pad, which sometimes can cause the brake to grab the rim and get 
stuck.
 
 The solution for uneven wear on brake pads is to use a utility knife to 
cut off the ridge and flatten the pad (see Figure 8-5). Another option 
is to use sandpaper or a file to smooth it out. This is also a good time 
to adjust the brakes so that they don’t continue to wear unevenly (see 
“Adjusting Brakes,” later in this chapter).

124

Figure 8-5: 
Resurfacing 
brake pads.
 
 
2. While you’re examining the brake pads, make sure they’re about 1mm 
to 2mm from the rim.
 
 They might rub the rim if they’re too close or not give you enough brak-
ing power if they’re too far away.
 
3. Squeeze the brake lever and confirm that the brakes grab the rim 
firmly and parallel to the rim.
 
4. Examine the cable to make sure it’s firmly attached to the brakes and 
is not kinked, frayed, or worn in any spot.
 
5. Check the rims to make sure they aren’t dirty.
 
 If they are dirty, use a rag and a solvent like rubbing alcohol to clean 
them.
 
6. If you just finished working on the brakes, give them a test drive while 
biking at a slow speed.
Removing and Installing 
Brakes and Brake Pads
If you ride your bike regularly, you’ll eventually have to change your brake 
pads. In this section, we tell you how to change brake pads and how to 
remove and install brakes (in case you need to overhaul or completely 
replace them).

125
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
Removing brakes and brake pads
The procedures for removing V-brakes and cantilever brakes are the same. 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Pinch the brakes together and lift the end of the cable up and out of 
the quick release in the brake arm where the cable sits (as shown in 
Figure 8-6).
 
Figure 8-6: 
Undoing 
the quick-
release.
 
 
2. Undo the bolt that holds the brake onto the pivot (as shown in 
Figure 8-7).
 
 Be careful as you loosen the bolt, because the spring may cause the 
brake arms to snap back or parts such as washers to shoot off the brake.
 
3. Pull the brake off the boss (as shown in Figure 8-8).
 
4. To remove the pad in cartridge-brake shoes, look for a small screw or 
pin holding the pad in place and remove it as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
 Figure 8-10 shows how the pad slides off once the pin is removed. If 
there isn’t one, use a screwdriver to pry the pad off.

128
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Here’s how to remove center-mount brakes:
 
1. Loosen the cable anchor bolt and remove the cable.
 
2. Using an Allen wrench or a 10mm open hex wrench, loosen and 
remove the center bolt mounting nut on the back and remove the 
complete brake caliper.
 
3. To remove the pad in cartridge brake shoes, look for a small screw or 
pin holding the pad in place and remove it (refer to Figure 8-9).
 
 Refer to Figure 8-10 to see how the pad slides off once the pin is 
removed. If there isn’t one, use a screwdriver to pry the pad off.
 
Some bikes don’t have cartridge brake shoes and have non-replaceable 
brakes pads. If your bike falls into this category, think about changing to 
replaceable pads, especially if you ride a lot and will go through pads rela-
tively quickly. With the cartridge pads, you slip a new pad into the brakes 
and you don’t have to readjust the alignment and angle of the brake shoes 
every time they’re replaced.
Installing brakes
After you’ve reattached the brake pads, you’re ready to reinstall the brakes. 
To install cantilever brakes, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply a small amount of grease to the bosses, the frame post that the 
brake arms mount to.
 
2. Slide each brake arm onto a boss, inserting the small pin at the end of 
the brakes’ coiled spring into the middle hole.
 
3. Insert the pivot bolt into the boss and tighten it with an Allen wrench.
 
4. Run the end of the cable through the cable clamp and, while squeez-
ing the brakes against the rim with one hand, tighten the cable clamp 
bolt with the other.
 
 Bike shops often use a fourth-hand tool to help tighten the brake cable 
(see Figure 8-11).
To install V-brakes, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply a small amount of grease to the pivots.
 
2. Slide each brake onto a pivot, inserting the small pin at the end of the 
brakes’ coiled spring into the middle hole.
 
 The top hole will give that side of the brake more recoil tension and the 
lower hole will give that side less recoil tension. These are used if the 
fine-tuning spring adjustment is not enough (see “Adjusting Brakes,” 
later in this chapter).

3. Insert the pivot bolt into the boss and tighten with an Allen wrench.
 
4. Pass the cable wire through the metal curved tube (called the noodle) 
that comes with the brakes.
 
5. Insert the metal tube with cable wire into the slot in the cable holder 
until the tip is poking out through the other end and is firmly in place.
 
6. Insert the cable wire into the rubber sleeve and slide the sleeve onto 
the tip of the metal tube.
 
7. Run the end of the cable through the cable clamp and, while holding 
and squeezing the brakes against the rim with one hand, tighten the 
cable clamp bolt with the other.
 
 Bike shops often use a fourth-hand tool, which eliminates the need to 
hold the brakes together (refer to Figure 8-11).
To install center-mount brakes, follow these steps:
 
1. Examine and make note of the spacers and washers on the front and 
rear center mounting bolts.
 
 Sometimes they have moon-shaped spacers that need to go next to 
the front and/or back part of the frame or fork. Other times, they use a 
recessed mounting nut with the lock washer on the side closest to the 

130
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
brake caliper, or just a standard nut with the lock washer on the back 
side next to the nut. The front brake will usually have the longer center 
mounting bolt.
 
2. Remove the nut, spacers, and washers that will be on the inside of the 
frame or fork, and insert the center mounting bolt through the hole 
either in the fork or the rear brake bridge.
 
3. Install the remaining spacers and washer.
 
4. While holding the brakes so that they’re centered over the rim, 
tighten with the nut.
 
5. Run the end of the cable through the cable housing stop, and then 
through the cable clamp and, while squeezing the brakes against the 
rim with one hand, tighten the cable clamp bolt with the other hand.
 
6. Set your pads and make your final adjustments (see “Adjusting 
Brakes,” next).
 
7. Trim the excess cable to about 2 inches, and put a cable end cap on it 
so it doesn’t fray.
Adjusting Brakes
Adjusting your brakes is important to ensure that you can slow down or 
come to a stop quickly and effortlessly each time you squeeze the brake 
levers. In this section, we tell you how to adjust your brakes in order to maxi-
mize their effectiveness.
 
Sometimes brakes are a little temperamental when it comes to adjustments. 
Just have a little patience and try not to get temperamental yourself when it 
takes several tries to get the position just right. With a little practice, you’ll be 
able to do it in a snap.
Adjusting brake-pad position
In order for your brakes to grab the rim of your bike’s wheel firmly, they need 
to be in the proper position. Follow these steps to adjust your brakes’ position:
 
1. Hold the brake pad with one hand and undo the nut or bolt holding the 
brake shoe one or two turns to loosen it just slightly (see Figure 8-12).
 
2. Squeeze one of the brake levers so that the pad is pressed up against 
the rim.

131
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
 
3. While holding the lever with one hand, position the pad so that it 
lines up parallel with the rim. Also adjust the pad so that the front 
part of the pad is closer to the rim than the back part.
 
 This alignment of the brake pads is called toe in.
 
 Some brakes have concave and convex washers to help with the toe-in 
adjustments. Sometimes, with center-mount brakes, you need to put an 
adjustable wrench on the brake arm itself and bend it slightly to make 
the toe-in adjustment.
 
4. Hold the pad in place and release the lever. As you’re holding the 
pad, tighten the bolt to secure the pad in its current position.
 
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for the other brake pad.
 
 When you’re finished, the front part of the brakes should be angled in 
slightly (toe in) such that that the end of the brake pads closest to the 
front of the bike is 1mm from the rim and the back part of the brakes 
pads are 2mm from the rim.

Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Centering and tensioning brakes
To ensure that your brakes operate as they were designed, you may need to 
make some adjustments to their position. These adjustments include center-
ing the brakes so that the brake pads are aligned evenly with the rim. You may 
also have to adjust the tension so that the brakes remain within a millimeter or 
two from the rim and will grab the rim with the slightest grip of the brake lever.
There are a few general rules of thumb you can keep in mind when making 
adjustments:
 
✓ You shouldn’t be able to “bottom out” the hand levers against the han-
dlebars while fully clamping down on the brakes.
 
✓ Your brakes shouldn’t rub the rims.
 
✓ You shouldn’t be able to push the front or rear wheel and get it to move 
while the brakes are applied.
 
✓ The front and rear brakes should feel relatively even in brake lever 
tension.
Adjusting brake tension
With properly tensioned brakes, the brake pads should be positioned 1mm to 
2mm from the rim and easily grab the rim when the brake lever is squeezed. 
To adjust the tension, you can do a few things:
 
✓ Some brakes have a small screw at the bottom of the brake arm, which 
allows for small adjustments to be made to the distance between the rim 
and the pads. Turning the screw clockwise will move the pad away from 
the rim; turning the screw counterclockwise will move the pad closer 
(see Figure 8-13).
 
✓ Another possibility is to adjust the barrel adjuster at the brake levers or 
at the brakes. Turn the adjuster one turn, and note the results adjusting 
for more or less tension.
 
✓ You can also try removing both of the brake arms and changing the 
frame mounting hole in which the spring pin is inserted. Reinstall the 
brake spring in the top or the highest of the three holes. Readjust the 
brake and check the results.
 
✓ If the fine-tuning of the screw, barrel adjuster, and spring pin is not 
enough to increase tension on the brakes, you’ll have to loosen the 
cable bolt (which holds the cable in place), pull the cable tighter, and 
retighten the bolt. Special tools can facilitate this procedure including a 
third-hand tool (which holds the brakes together) and a fourth-hand tool 
(which pulls the cable tight). With four hands working for you, you can’t 
go wrong!

Centering your brakes
In most cases, your brakes should be symmetrical and an equal distance 
from the wheel rim. If one of the brake pads touches the rim before the other 
or, even worse, rubs on the rim while you’re riding, an adjustment to center 
the brakes may be needed.
 
Before you center the brakes, make sure that:
 
✓ Your wheel is centered in the frame or fork.
 
✓ Your wheel is trued.
 
✓ Your wheel is spinning straight.
If your wheel isn’t centered, true, and spinning straight, what may appear like 
a brake being off-center may be the wheel wobbling toward one of the brakes. 
(See Chapter 7 for how to make adjustments to your wheel.)
The procedures for centering brakes may vary slightly depending on what 
type of brakes you have, but here are some strategies you may be able to try:
 
✓ If the brakes have a small screw, try adjusting it with a screwdriver or 
Allen wrench and note the result.

134
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
✓ In some cases, with center-mount brakes, you may need to rotate the 
entire brake caliper on the center mounting bolt to get the desired 
result. Try loosening the mounting bolt, rotating the brake, and then 
retightening it.
 
✓ The brakes may have different spring tensions. If so, try removing one 
of the brake arms and changing the frame mounting hole in which the 
spring pin is inserted. Reinstall the brake and check the results.
 
You want to have the adjusting barrels unthreaded (counterclockwise) one 
or two revolutions when you’re finished with your brake adjustments. This 
allows you to thread them back in (clockwise) if your rim comes out of true 
on a ride so your brakes aren’t rubbing and slowing you down.
To center dual-pivot brakes with a quick-release lever, you can adjust the 
brake tension using an Allen wrench or screwdriver. First, open the quick-
release lever to remove tension on the cable (as shown in Figure 8-14). Then, 
using the Allen wrench or screwdriver, turn the adjuster clockwise or coun-
terclockwise to make the space between the rim and the brake pads equal on 
both sides (see Figure 8-15). You can also make smaller, fine-tuning adjust-
ments by turning the barrel adjuster (see Figure 8-16).

Silencing those squeaking brakes!
Probably one of the biggest issues with brakes is squeaking. Coming to a stop 
with a loud screech that makes everyone look up at you is no fun — unless 
you use the screech in place of a bell or a horn. People will certainly get out 
of your way!
One of the biggest causes of squeaking is improperly positioned brake pads. 
If your brakes squeak, try adjusting the pads, as described in the “Adjusting 
brake-pad position” section, so that the front part is toed inward toward the 
rims (see Figure 8-17). Many types of brakes have spacers on the pad holder 
that can be adjusted to move the pad into the proper position. Loosen the 
mounting bolt and then use your hand to move the spacers and the pad. 
When you find the toe-in position, tighten the bolt.
 
Figure 8-17: 
Proper 
brake 
alignment.
 
Wheel
rotation
Another possible cause of squeaking is dirty or oily rims. If you haven’t 
cleaned your rims in a while, use some rubbing alcohol and a rag, and wipe 
them down. To keep them clean going forward, wipe the rims with a damp 
rag each time you finish a ride.
In some cases, squeaking is caused by brake pads that have hardened over 
time. If your brakes are more than a few years old try replacing them to elimi-
nate the noise.
Finally, inspect the brake pads for foreign debris. Something wedged into the 
rubber may be causing the squeal.

137
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
Using the brake quick release
Many brakes are designed with a quick-release capability that makes it easy 
to spread them apart when you need to remove the wheel. This quick release 
may also be used if you badly bend your wheel rim and the rim is rubbing the 
brake pads.
 
Riding with the quick release engaged will greatly reduce the effectiveness of 
your brakes.
The quick-release mechanism — which may be a button, a lever, or an easy 
way to detach the cable — differs depending on the type of brake:
 
✓ For cantilever brakes, squeeze the brake arms together with one hand 
to create slack in the cable and, with the other hand, lift the loose end of 
the cable out of its pocket. Release the breaks and they’ll pop open.
 
✓ For V-brakes, pinch together the top of the brake arms to loosen the 
cable. Pull the rubber boot back to expose the cable (see Figure 8-18). 
Carefully pull the cable out of the narrow slot in the cable holder and 
release it to open the brakes (see Figure 8-19).
 
Figure 8-18: 
Releasing 
V-brakes.
 

138
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 8-19: 
V-brakes 
released.
 
 
✓ For center-mount brakes, look for a small lever on the side of the cali-
per where the cable is attached (refer to Figure 8-14). Pull it upward 
and release the brakes just enough to allow the wheel to pass. In some 
models, you’ll need to look for a button on the hand lever and push it to 
release the tension on the brakes.
If you can’t find the release on your brakes, examine the brake levers. On 
some bikes, there is a quick-release button on the brake lever. Push it to 
increase the clearance between the brake pads.
 
If you’re trying to remove the tire but you can’t figure out how to open the 
brakes, try letting air out of the tire. This will reduce the width of the tire and 
may allow it to pass between the brake pads. After you put the wheel back in 
place, reinflate it.
Replacing brake cables
Brake cables are a critical component of your braking system. You can have 
new brake pads, but if your brake cables give out, you won’t be able to stop 
your bike when you need to. Each time you give a hard squeeze to your brake 
levers, the cables must transfer that force to the brake pads. Over time, this 
force will wear out the cables, causing them to kink, fray, or bend. If you see 
these signs of wear with your brake cables, do the safe thing and change 
them immediately. Here’s how:

139
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
 
1. Unfasten the brake cable by loosening the nut or bolt where the cable 
attaches to the brake arm.
 
2. Squeeze the brake lever so that the nipple at the end of the cable is 
showing.
 
3. Grab the end of the cable with a pair of pliers and pull the cable 
slightly out from the brake lever.
 
 Before you remove the brake cable, take a moment to observe how it is 
routed around the frame of the bike. Pay attention to the location of the 
cable housing and where the cable housing meets the cable stops and 
the cable exits on the other side. You’ll need to route the cable and 
cable housing in the same manner when you reinstall it. You want the 
housing to be as short as possible. The housing should have gradual 
curves with out any binding or sharp angles.
 
4. Once you grab the cable, use your hands to remove the entire length 
of the cable (see Figure 8-20).
 
5. Collect any ferrules that were holding the cable housing in place at 
the anchor points.
 
 You’ll use these when you reinstall the cable.
 
 It’s a good practice to change the cable housing when you replace cable 
wires. Manufacturers often sell cable with the housing included in the 
package. They normally give you more housing than you need so you’ll 
have to cut it to fit your bike.
 
Figure 8-20: 
Removing 
the cable.
 

140
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
6. Cut the cable housing with cable cutters (see Figure 8-21).
 
 Cable cutters are useful because they cut the housing without compress-
ing the end too much. Assuming the old housing was the proper length, 
use the older pieces of cable housing as guides for cutting the new 
pieces.
 
 Even if you use a cable cutter, you may need to file the end of the cable 
if it has any sharp edges. You may also need to open the end of the 
housing up with an awl or other pointed instrument if the end looks like 
the example on the left in Figure 8-22.
 
7. When you’re ready to install the new cable, use a rag to apply a light 
coating of grease to its surface.
 
8. Squeeze the brake lever and insert the cable into the hold from where 
you originally removed it (as shown in Figure 8-23).
 
 You may have to wiggle it around to pass it through the brake lever. Pull 
the cable out the other side of the brake lever.
 
 Be cautious with the cable tip to prevent it fraying during the installation.
 
9. Attach the ferrules that came with the cable housing to the ends of 
each piece of housing (as shown in Figure 8-24).
 
10. Insert the cable into the proper cable housing and pull it out the 
other end.
 
Figure 8-21: 
Cutting the 
cable 
housing.
 

141
 Chapter 8: Stopping Short: Brakes
 
Figure 8-22: 
Properly cut 
cable 
housing.
 
 
Figure 8-23: 
Inserting the 
cable.
 
 
11. Route the cable and cable housing around the frame of the bike in the 
same position as it was previously.

142
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
 The ferrules at the end of the cable housing should fit snugly into the 
cable stops on the frame. In some cases, the ferrule will not fit in, so just 
remove it — the cable stop acts as built in ferrule at this location.
 
12. While holding the brakes against the rim with one hand or a fourth-
hand tool, tighten the cable anchor bolt.
 
13. Test the brakes by squeezing the brake lever as hard as you can three 
or four times.
 
 This will stretch the brake cable and seat the ferrules. You may need to 
readjust the brake cable after this.
 
Figure 8-24: 
A ferrule.
 
A brake cable may break on you at some point. If this happens, you can 
continue to ride, although you’ll need to use more caution and give yourself 
greater stopping distance. The front brakes have much more braking power 
than the rear, so if you’re lucky, your rear brakes will go out. This is why you 
have to replace your front brake pads more often than the rear. Just be careful 
that you don’t apply them too quickly; otherwise, when your front wheel stops, 
the momentum from your body might send you flying over your handlebars.
 
If the front brake cable breaks on a long trip, replace it with the rear 
brake cable.

Taking Your Seat: 
Saddles and Seat Posts
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the different types of saddles
▶ Taking your saddle on and off your bike
▶ Improving your comfort by adjusting your saddle
▶ Using suspension seat posts
T
his chapter is devoted to your butt. In particular, it’s devoted to making 
sure that your butt is not a source of frustration while you ride.
Your body has three points of contact with your bike and your saddle is the 
part of the bike where the majority of your weight is supported. If you don’t 
have a saddle that suits your anatomy or that’s properly adjusted, you can 
rest assured that your butt is going to be one big pain in the butt after your 
next long ride.
Every butt is unique. There isn’t one style of saddle or one formula for adjust-
ing the saddle that works for everyone. Finding a saddle that fits your anat-
omy and finding the position that’s most comfortable both take time.
We start this chapter by covering the various types of saddles available. 
Then we tell you how to make adjustments to your saddle so you can find an 
enjoyable riding position.
 
Even if you find the saddle type and position that’s perfect for you, it’ll take 
some time to break in the saddle — and to break in your bum.

Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Saddle Up! Types of Saddles
No two butts are the same, and there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all 
saddle. A wide variety of saddles are on the market — saddles made of dif-
ferent materials, designed for different functions, and tailored for men or 
women. In this section, we discuss a few of these differences so that you can 
find the saddle that’s best for you.
Material
Bicycle saddles are typically covered with leather, plastic, or vinyl. The most 
popular saddles on the market today are the ones covered in plastic or vinyl. 
Underneath the plastic or vinyl covers, they’re made of gels and high-density 
foams. These saddles vary in thickness and weight depending on the type 
of shell underneath. They don’t require much maintenance, they’re durable, 
and they resist water — all of which contributes to their popularity. (See 
Figure 9-8, later in this chapter, for an example of a vinyl-covered saddle.)
The less-popular leather saddles (such as the one shown in Figure 9-1) are 
built with a single piece of leather stretched across a steel frame. (Brooks is 
a well known leather saddle manufacturer.) People usually either love or hate 
leather saddles. Those who use them usually swear by them and wouldn’t 
consider setting their tushes on anything else.

145
 Chapter 9: Taking Your Seat: Saddles and Seat Posts
 
Leather saddles are very stiff, but they also provide the maximum support for 
sit bones without the padding that actually puts more pressure on soft tissue.
But the nice thing about leather is that it’s moldable. A leather saddle may 
feel like a rock when you first buy it, but over time it’ll begin to shape to the 
form of your body. Breaking in a leather saddle takes a little time, but when 
you’re done, you’ll have a seat form-fit to your butt.
 
Leather products such as conditioners, saddle soaps, and other compounds 
can speed this process. They also help protect and extend the life of your 
saddle.
When you ride with a leather saddle, take along a plastic bag in case it rains. 
You can use it protect the saddle from soaking up water and drying out. If the 
saddle does get wet, allow it to dry naturally.
 
The base or foundation of the saddle is arguably the important consideration. 
It doesn’t matter how much or what type of padding there is on top, if the 
base is a piece of sheet metal, hard and stiff, or not the correct shape, you’ll 
have a very uncomfortable ride. Make sure the base or foundation is flexible 
and the proper fit or style for your butt.
Function
Saddles are built for two main functions: cruising or racing.
Cruising saddles (see Figure 9-2) are wide, extra-cushioned saddles designed 
for casual riders who sit in the upright position. The extra padding helps sup-
port the extra weight on the seat that comes from sitting upright. Sometimes 
cruising saddles are cushioned with horizontal and/or vertical springs. Most 
people ride on cruising bikes for leisure, so the wide seat doesn’t cause a 
problem with the restriction of leg movement as it would on a racing-style 
bicycle.
Racing saddles (see Figure 9-3) are specially designed to allow a full range 
of motion when pedaling. They’re normally lightweight, thin (with little pad-
ding), and narrow. They’re designed with grooves, channels, and splits in the 
shell to help reduce pressure on sensitive areas of the pelvic region. These 
saddles are no longer restricted just to racers — many midrange bikes are 
now equipped with racing saddles.

Gender
The last factor to consider when choosing a saddle is the gender of the pri-
mary rider. Saddles for men and women are designed for the differences in 
anatomy between the two sexes. Men’s saddles are typically longer and nar-
rower in the back, whereas women’s saddles are shorter and wider to accom-
modate women’s wider pelvic bones. A women’s saddle also frequently has a 
cut-away behind the nose to provide extra comfort.

147
 Chapter 9: Taking Your Seat: Saddles and Seat Posts
 
If a woman were to use a seat designed for a man, the two small bones at the 
bottom of her pelvic bone would not be supported properly. There are differ-
ent sit-bone widths, and finding a saddle that corresponds to your sit-bone 
width, regardless if it’s for men or women, is essential.
Removing and Installing a Saddle
There are a number of different ways in which saddles attach to seat posts. 
On some older or lower-end models, the seat post and the seat clamp are two 
separate pieces with the bolt horizontal and tightened with a nut (as shown 
in Figure 9-4). This type of seat clamp only has a limited number of groves 
and ridges for the seat-angle adjustment — as opposed to the next two clamp 
styles, which have about twice the number of seat-angle adjustment points, 
which allows you to find a much more comfortable riding position.
On many bikes, the seat clamp is integrated into the seat post and the saddle 
is attached with one or two vertical bolts, which are adjusted with an Allen 
wrench. Figures 9-5 and 9-6 show a saddle with a one-piece clamp.
Getting comfortable in the saddle
When you first start riding, you may have a lit-
eral pain in the butt. But there are some steps 
you can take to get comfortable in your saddle:
 ✓ Try a variety of different saddles. The only 
way to tell if you’ll like a saddle is to ride 
on it, so many bike stores will allow you to 
take a saddle overnight and exchange it for 
a different one if needed.
 ✓ Don’t forget to move around. Instead of sit-
ting in the same position for hours at a time, 
try shifting your weight and hand position 
every so often.
 ✓ Wear the right clothing. Biking shorts are 
designed without seams to help prevent 
chafing. They also have special fabric to 
wick away moisture and keep you dry.
 ✓ Adjust the height and angle. Sometimes it 
takes a little experimenting to find the right 
combination. Use the advice in this chapter 
to find the position that’s best for you.
 ✓ Exercise your butt. The more you ride, the 
more your bottom will adjust to sitting on 
the saddle.
Strange as it sounds, the more you ride, the 
more you’ll like a smaller saddle. Give yourself 
time to get used to the saddle. A cushy saddle 
may seem comfortable at first, but it isn’t for 
regular riders.

Another style of clamp is the two-piece clamp. It allows for a lot of flexibility 
in terms of adjusting the fore and aft of the saddle; however, it is a little trick-
ier to attach. Here’s how:
 
1. Turn the saddle upside down and remove the seat post.
 
2. Hold the bottom half of the clamp under the seat rails with your 
fingers.
 
3. While supporting the bottom half of the clamp, slide the square nut 
under the clamp and hold it in place with your fingers.
 
4. Lay the top half of the clamp on top, making sure that both clamps 
align with one another.
 
 At this point, you should still be supporting the bottom half of the clamp 
and the square nut with your hand.
 
5. Place the seat post on the top clamp, insert the bolt, and tighten (as 
shown in Figure 9-7).

Adjusting the Saddle Fore, 
Aft, and Height
Adjustments to the saddle can make a big difference in comfort when you 
ride whether it is a long or even short trip. After all, most of your weight is 
being supported by the saddle.
In this section, we tell you how to adjust the angle, fore and aft, and height of 
your saddle. Take the time to adjust your saddle properly, and you’ll feel the 
benefits on your next ride.
Angling for the right angle
If your saddle is tilted slightly downward in the front, your weight is going to 
be slid forward, putting extra pressure on your arms and shoulders. On the 
other hand, if the saddle is sloped upward in the front, you may feel extra 
pressure on the groin area. In general, the recommendation is to keep the 
saddle flat.

151
 Chapter 9: Taking Your Seat: Saddles and Seat Posts
 
Place a level on top of your saddle to help you set it flat.
To adjust the angle of your saddle, follow these steps:
 
1. Loosen the saddle clamp bolt a few turns.
 
2. Work the saddle up and down with your hand, jimmying the saddle 
into the position you want.
 
3. Retighten the clamp bolt.
Fore and aft, to and fro
If your seat is too far forward, you won’t be using your leg muscles efficiently 
and your knees can get sore. If your seat is too far to the rear, you’ll be stretch-
ing to reach the handlebars, which will put strain on your back and knees.
In Chapter 18, we tell you how to use a weighted string to find the fore-and-aft 
position that’s right for you. After you have the position, follow these steps 
to adjust the saddle backward or forward:
 
1. Unloosen the saddle clamp bolt one turn (as shown in Figure 9-8).
 
2. Tap the saddle with your hand to move it forward or backward.
 
3. Retighten the clamp bolt.

152
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 Height matters
The proper saddle height is as important as, if not more important than, the 
angle and fore and aft of the saddle. When your saddle is at the right height 
for your body, you can efficiently transfer force to the pedals. If you set the 
height too low, you risk injury by putting undue stress on your knees. Set the 
height too high, and you’ll be bouncing around on the seat, giving the nerves 
in your butt a Swedish massage.
Follow the instructions in Chapter 18 to find the proper height for your 
saddle. Then follow these steps to set the height:
 
1. Loosen the seat-post bolt or the quick-release binder that’s holding the 
seat post in place.
 
 If you don’t have a quick release on the seat post, you’ll probably have a 
bolt that can be loosened with an Allen wrench (as shown in Figure 9-9).
 
Figure 9-9: 
If you 
don’t have 
a quick-
release on 
your seat 
post, you’ll 
need to 
loosen the 
clamp bolt.
 

153
 Chapter 9: Taking Your Seat: Saddles and Seat Posts
 
 After loosening the seat post, you should be able to slide the seat post up 
and down. If the post is difficult to move, try rotating the seat back and 
forth while pulling up on the seat. This is usually enough to pry it free.
 
 If the post still won’t move for you, you can try dripping some oil or 
penetrating lubricant on the seat post and letting it work its way down 
between the frame and the seat post. Another last-ditch trick is to use 
a screwdriver and pry apart the clamp or lug pinching the post 
together.
 
2. If you used oil or penetrating lubricant to loosen the post, use a 
degreaser afterwards to clean it off.
 
 You’ll want it clean so that, when you apply grease to prevent corrosion, 
the grease will adhere to the post.
 
 Before installing the post, apply grease to its shaft to prevent corrosion.
 
 Don’t use grease if you have a carbon frame or seat post. Grease can 
cause a chemical reaction that can attack the carbon frame and/or 
carbon seat post.
 
3. Set the saddle and seat post to the proper height while tightening the 
bolt or quick-release clamp.
 
 Make sure the saddle is aligned straight.
 
4. Give the bike a test drive to confirm that the saddle is at the right 
height.
 
 When you’re comfortable with the height, use a file or other tool with a 
sharp edge to mark the correct height of the post. If you have an expen-
sive or stylish seat post that you don’t want to mar, you can also use a 
piece of electrical tape to mark the seat post. This marking will allow 
you to reset the height if the post loosens for some reason.

154
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Suspension seat posts
When most people think about suspension on 
bikes, they think of rear and front suspension 
on mountain bikes. What doesn’t get a lot of 
attention is suspension in the seat post (see the 
figure). If you’re looking for a more comfortable 
ride, you might want to consider this option.
When you’re installing a suspension seat post, 
read the owner’s manual to understand how to 
preload it for your weight. Heavier riders need a 
stiffer suspension than lighter riders do.
Suspension posts should be set a little higher 
than normal because your weight will cause it 
drop slightly. Riding a bicycle with a suspension 
seat post takes a little getting used to because 
it’s a couple inches higher when you first get 
on, and then it compresses with your weight 
to the proper height for riding. Take your Allen 
wrench along when you ride and you can adjust 
it when needed.

Hitting the Links: The Chain
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the different types of chains
▶ Dealing with common problems with chains
▶ Replacing your chain
▶ Caring for your chain
A
lthough it doesn’t garner much attention, the chain is an especially 
important part of the bike. If one of your cables breaks or a derailleur 
gives out, you can still ride your bike. But if the chain snaps or malfunctions, 
you can’t do much except walk your bike home. The chain is also important 
because it comes in contact with other parts of your bike. If the chain is dirty 
or needs to be replaced, it will cause cogs, chainrings, and derailleurs to 
wear out more quickly.
To look at a chain, you might think that it doesn’t require much care. After 
all, a chain is supposed to be something durable and unbreakable, right? 
Unfortunately, this isn’t the case with a bike chain, where any one link can be 
the “weak link.”
In order to ensure that your chain has the long life that the manufacturer 
intended and doesn’t wear out other components prematurely, invest time in 
cleaning and lubricating the chain on a regular basis. In this chapter, we tell you 
how to clean and lube your chain properly and describe the kind of lubrications 
available to keep it functioning in peak form. We also show you how to replace 
a chain, which you’ll need to do when the chain begins to stretch or wear out.
A Chain Is Not a Chain Is Not 
a Chain: Types of Chains
To the untrained eye, most bike chains look the same. But pull two bikes off 
the road and compare the chains and you’ll likely find that they have different 
chains, designed specifically to work with the bikes’ particular components. 

156
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
For example, a 1/8-inch-wide chain is designed to work with kids’ single-speed, 
fixed-gear, and three-speed bikes (basically most bicycles without a rear derail-
leur). The majority of bikes use a 3/32-inch-wide chain. However, knowing the 
width is not enough. You need to purchase a chain that is designed to work 
with the number of cogs on your bike. If you tell someone in your local bike 
store how many cogs are on your bike, they can help you find the right chain.
Here are the two major types of chains you’re likely to find:
 
✓ SRAM PowerLink–type chains: SRAM PowerLink and other similar types 
of chains resemble the old master-link chains found on single-speed 
bikes. You may remember these from when you were a kid (if you were 
a kid in the ’60s or ’70s). Figure 10-1 shows an example of an SRAM 
PowerLink chain, and Figure 10-2 shows an old-school master-link chain.
 
 By the way, SRAM is a manufacturer of bike components. You can find

✓ Shimano- and Campagnolo-type chains: Most bikes have chains that fall 
into this category. Shimano- and Campagnolo-type chains use a special 
replacement pin for installation (see Figure 10-3).
 
 Shimano and Campagnolo are manufacturers of bike components. You 
can find out more at www.shimano.com and www.campagnolo.com.
 
✓ Chains with reusable rivets: This type of chain uses reusable rivets, 
which are partially pressed out of the chain during separation and then 
pressed back in with a chain tool. This saves you from having to keep 
special replacement pins handy.

If you’re replacing a chain, make sure you choose one that matches the 
number of cogs on your cassette. If you choose the wrong size chain, you may 
have shifting troubles. It’s also important to identify whether you have a drive-
train that requires a specially designed chain. For example, Shimano makes a 
Hyperglide line of products that include specially shaped cogs that facilitate 
shifting. When in doubt, take your bike into your local bike shop so that they 
can quickly tell you which kind of chain you need. To read more about cogs 
and cassettes and the drivetrain, refer to Chapters 11 and 13, respectively.

Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Recognizing What Can Go 
Wrong with the Chain
The chain is completely exposed at the bottom of your bike, so it easily 
picks up dirt and grime, twigs and leaves can get caught in it, and it can be 
impacted with foreign objects (especially if you’re riding off-road) — all of 
which can undermine the chain’s integrity and lead to a break at the most 
inopportune time.
There are a number of telltale signs that you have an issue with your chain:
 
✓ You have to exaggerate the movement of your shifter to force the chain 
to jump to another cog on the rear wheel.
 
✓ The pedal jerks forward when you’re applying pressure, because the 
chain skipped a tooth on a cog.
 
✓ Pedaling is not as smooth as it once was.
 
✓ The chain makes a lot of noise while you pedal but not while you coast.
Issues with your chain can be caused by a number of factors. The most 
common of them are dirt, stiff links, and normal wear and tear.
Getting down and dirty
The chain is one of the parts of your bike that’s completely exposed to the 
elements. This, combined with the fact that it has to be covered in lubrica-
tion to work properly, makes the chain a magnet for dirt and grime.
The abrasive qualities of dirt begin to wear down the chain and the other 
parts that the chain comes in contact with, such as the cogs, chainrings, 
and rear derailleur pulley wheels. When dirt works its way into the chain 
links, they become stiff, which hampers your bike’s shifting ability (see the 
following section).
Stuck in a rut: Stiff links
If you find that your chain is skipping or making a consistent, repetitive noise 
when you’re pedaling, you may have a stiff link. To find a stiff link, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Shift the chain onto the smallest cog.

159
 Chapter 10: Hitting the Links: The Chain
 
 This puts the most bend in the chain and causes the stiff link to be 
more apparent.
 
2. Slowly rotate the pedals backward, keeping your eye on the chain and 
the rear derailleur.
 
 If the chain has difficulty moving through the pulley wheels at one point, 
you’ve likely got a stiff link.
Stiff links are sometimes caused by a lack of lubrication. The other possibility 
is that, when the chain was connected, the chain plates in the link were com-
pressed tightly together, making it difficult for the link to pivot.
To take care of a stiff link, first try lubricating the rollers that sit inside the 
offending link. Give the lubrication a little time to work its way down into the 
joint and then, while holding each side of the link (use a rag if you don’t want 
to be covered in grease), pivot the link up and down to try to loosen it.
If lubrication doesn’t solve the problem, try flexing the chain back and forth 
by pushing inward with your thumbs and twisting outward with your hands 
to work it free, as shown in Figure 10-4. Reverse the position by pushing 
inward with your thumbs on the other side of the chain a few times. This 
should be enough to restore flexibility to the chain.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Loosening a 
stiff chain.
 

160
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Sometimes with a stiff chain, you’ll notice that a rivet is sticking out to one 
side more than the other rivets are. In this case, you’ll need to use a chain 
tool to push it back in. Put the chain in the chain tool and turn the handle 
just a small amount, maybe one-eighth of a turn. If the link is still tight, try 
repeating the procedure from the other side, rotating until it loosens up.
 
Some chain tools have two slots, or cradles, where you can rest the chain (see 
Figure 10-5). The slot farthest away from the handle is the primary cradle and 
is used for breaking and connecting chains. The other cradle is specifically 
designed for tight links, so make sure you use this one.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Cradles in a 
chain tool.
 
Wear and tear
Although keeping your chain clean and lubricated will greatly extend its life, 
normal use of the chain will eventually lead to wear. The chain does most of 
the work, transferring power to the rear wheel, revolution after revolution. 
After you’ve traveled enough miles, it begins to stretch, and after it starts 
stretching, it can rapidly wear out the chainrings and cogs. A stretched chain 
is also more vulnerable to breaking.
 
Stretching doesn’t mean that the chain links have increased in size. It just 
means that, over time, the wear on the rivets, rollers, and inner links increases 
the amount of play at each link. The accumulated looseness across many links 
causes a stretching effect.

161
 Chapter 10: Hitting the Links: The Chain
 
The best strategy is to be proactive and frequently inspect the chain for wear, 
at least during your monthly maintenance check.
The simplest way to check for chain wear is to measure the chain. To measure 
the chain, use a ruler and measure from pin center to pin center as is shown in 
Figure 10-6. Twelve paired links of a chain should measure 12 inches from pin 
center to pin center. A slightly longer length means that the chain has stretched.
 
Some companies offer chain measuring tools (see Figure 10-7) that are easy to 
use. If both ends of the tools set down inside the chain, the chain is the appro-
priate length.
 
Chains wear out at a faster rate than chainrings and cogs. If you determine 
early enough that your chain has started to wear or stretch, you can replace 
only the chain, which will save you a lot of money. If you’re really on top of 
things, you may go through two or three chains before you have to replace the 
more expensive chainrings and cogs.
 
If your chain is skipping when you apply force when pedaling, it may be due to 
worn teeth on the freewheel, cassette cogs, or chainring. Examine both and 
replace them as needed. (See Chapter 11 for more information on caring for 
cogs and Chapter 13 for chainrings.)

If you determine that the chain needs replacing, inspect the chainrings and 
cogs for wear. If the teeth on a cog or chainring are no longer symmetrical 
and look like an ocean wave or as though they’ve been filed down on one side 
(as shown in Figure 10-8), it’s time to replace the part. Another sign of tooth 
wear is the chain skipping when you pedal with a lot of force.

163
 Chapter 10: Hitting the Links: The Chain
Sometimes only one cog will wear out. This is usually the cog that corre-
sponds with the gear you use most when riding. If this is the case, you can 
replace just the cog and not the entire cassette, although sometimes it’s 
cheaper to buy a cassette than a set of replacement cogs. More often, you’ll 
end up replacing a single chainring and an entire cassette.
Caring for Your Chain
A bike’s chain is one of the most important parts of the bike to keep clean. It 
attracts dirt and grime because it is exposed on the bottom of your bike where 
it is close to the ground. Because it comes into contact with other parts of the 
bike, such as the derailleurs, it can spread dirt around your bike causing parts 
to wear out prematurely. Our best advice is to give the chain a simple cleaning 
each time you ride and then, once a month, give it a deeper cleaning.
Every time you ride, you should give your chain a simple cleaning and lubri-
cation. And at least once a month, you should give it a deeper cleaning. In the 
following sections, we cover both types of cleaning.
It is best to clean the chain while it is on the bike unless it is extremely dirty 
or it has been a long time since you have cleaned it.
Put the chain on the smallest sprocket before cleaning. This will expand it 
slightly and expose the pivoting points of the chain to allow degreaser and 
lubrication to work its way inside the links.
If the chain has a lot of mud or dirt caked on, rinse it off with water before 
beginning.
Clean the pulley wheels of the derailleur, chainrings, and cogs if they are 
dirty. You don’t want to undo all your hard work by running a newly cleaned 
chain across any other filthy components.
Keeping it simple: Cleaning 
and lubricating your chain
If you only have a few minutes and your chain is not overly dirty, all you need 
to clean your chain is a rag and a bottle of lube. (See the nearby sidebar, 
“Bike lubricants out the wazoo,” for more on different types of lubrication.)

164
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Here’s how to give your chain a simple cleaning and lubrication:
 
1. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring.
 
2. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag.
 
3. After you’ve wiped down the chain, apply lubrication to the top of the 
lower rung of the chain, where it exits from the rear derailleur, using 
a spray can or squeeze bottle.
 
4. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain as you lube it, com-
pleting ten revolutions of the chain to make sure you haven’t missed 
any links.
 
 You don’t need to douse the entire chain in lubricant. The goal is for the 
lubrication to work its way into the rollers inside the chain. There’s no 
need for the outer links to be covered in lubricant.
 
5. Wipe off any excess lubrication using a clean rag, as shown in 
Figure 10-9.
Bike lubricants out the wazoo
When you’re shopping for lubricants, the first 
step is to make sure you get one formulated for 
bikes (as opposed to something that’s all-pur-
pose, or meant for motorcycle chains, chain-
saws, or car engines).
After you’ve narrowed down the possibilities to 
the lubes meant for bikes, your next choice will 
likely be dry (meaning, they pick up less dirt) or 
wet (meaning, they’re harder to wash away in 
wet conditions). Unless you’re going to be riding 
in wet conditions or crossing streams, we rec-
ommend sticking to a dry lubricant.
You may also see wax-based lubes — these 
are dry lubes that attract the least amount of 
dirt and grime and will keep your chain look-
ing clean. But they need frequent application 
because they don’t last long, especially in wet 
conditions. Also, they work best when they’re 
applied or bonded to a chain that has been 
completely degreased. Unless you’re willing to 
commit to frequent applications of lubrication, 
we recommend against wax-based lubes.
Lubricants are sold in aerosol spray cans and 
squeeze bottles. Many riders prefer squeeze 
bottles because they can control the flow, 
applying lubrication drop by drop. With a spray 
can, it’s too easy to get lubrication where you 
don’t need it (such as on the outside of the 
chain) or where you definitely don’t want it 
(such as on wheel rims).
Some manufacturers recommend that when 
you start with a lubricant you stick with it, and 
not change horses midstream. Regular cleaning 
and lubrication of your chain is probably more 
important than whether you mix lubricants, but 
if you’re finicky about your bike, sticking with 
one lubricant doesn’t hurt.
Remember: New chains are lubricated by the 
manufacturer before they’re shipped. The qual-
ity of this straight-from-the-manufacturer lubri-
cation is better than what you can achieve with 
a store-bought lube. Under normal riding condi-
tions, you should be able to get several hundred 
miles with a new chain before you need to apply 
lubrication.

6. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring.
 
7. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag, and 
do this for several full revolutions.
Going deeper: Giving your chain 
a heavy-duty cleaning
You should give your chain a deeper cleaning at least once a month — more 
often depending on the conditions you ride in. With a deeper cleaning, you 
still leave the chain on the bike (see the preceding section) — the difference 
is, you first use a degreaser to remove any remaining, broken-down lubrica-
tion. You also give the chain a more rigorous cleaning by using a brush or a 
special chain scrubbing tool.
 
Most bike shops sell a chain cleaning tool (see Figure 10-10) that has a plastic 
housing that immerses a chain in degreaser while internal brushes scrub the 
chain links. This tool gives the chain a much deeper cleaning than you can 
accomplish with a rag or even a handheld brush.
To give your chain a deep cleaning by hand, follow these steps:
 
1. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring.

2. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag.
 
3. Drench a rag in degreaser, lightly grab the chain with the rag, and 
rotate the pedals in reverse to apply the degreaser to the chain.
 
4. Drag the chain along the surface of a toothbrush while you rotate the 
chain.
 
 Every few revolutions, rinse the brush off with degreaser.
 
5. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring. Rotate the 
pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag to remove the 
degreaser.
 
6. After you’ve wiped down the chain, apply lubrication to the top of the 
lower rung of the chain, where it exits from the rear derailleur using a 
spray can or squeeze bottle.
 
 Be sure all the degreaser is removed before applying new lubrication.
 
7. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain as you lube it, com-
pleting ten revolutions of the chain to make sure you haven’t missed 
any links.
 
 You don’t need to douse the entire chain in lubricant.
 
8. Wipe off any excess lubrication using a clean rag (refer to Figure 10-9).
If you have a chain cleaning tool, follow these steps:

167
 Chapter 10: Hitting the Links: The Chain
 
1. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring.
 
2. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag.
 
3. Fill the chain cleaning tool with degreaser to the mark.
 
4. In front of the rear derailleur where the chain exits, enclose the tool 
around the chain and rotate the pedals in reverse.
 
5. With a clean rag, grab the chain on the bottom, between the lower 
derailleur jockey wheel and the bottom of the chainring. Rotate the 
pedals in reverse to move the chain through the rag to remove the 
degreaser.
 
6. Apply lubrication to the top of the lower rung of the chain, where it 
exits from the rear derailleur using a spray can or squeeze bottle.
 
 Be sure all the degreaser is removed before applying new lubrication.
 
7. Rotate the pedals in reverse to move the chain as you lube it, com-
pleting ten revolutions of the chain to make sure you haven’t missed 
any links.
 
 You don’t need to douse the entire chain in lubricant.
 
8. Wipe off any excess lubrication using a clean rag (refer to Figure 10-9).
Replacing a Chain
Despite your best efforts at keeping the chain clean, eventually all your 
pedaling is going to wear it out. The chain is under constant force and ten-
sion and, as it’s shifted back and forth across the different gears, it begins to 
stretch. You can still ride on a stretched chain, but it’ll cause your cogs and 
chainrings to wear out faster. Because replacing the chain is much cheaper 
than replacing the cogs and chainrings, we recommend replacing your chain 
at the first sign of wear. In this section, we talk about how to remove a chain 
and then how to measure it and reconnect it when you’re ready to reinstall it.
 
Before you try to remove or install a chain, you need to know what type of 
chain you have (see “A Chain Is Not a Chain Is Not a Chain: Types of Chains,” 
earlier in this chapter). Each type of chain requires a different procedure for 
removing it and installing it.
Unchain me! Removing the chain
 
Before attempting to remove or cut the chain while it’s on a bike, shift it to the 
smallest cog in the rear and onto the frame and to the side of the small 
chainring in the front. If you don’t do this, the chain will be under tension and, 
as soon as it’s separated, it may be thrown back at you.

168
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
SRAM PowerLink–type chains have a single master link that can be separated 
and reconnected with common hand tools (pliers and/or a screwdriver), making 
chain removal and installation a simple task. To remove a PowerLink-type chain:
 
1. Find the master link.
 
2. Pinch the outer plates together and, at the same time, slide one plate 
forward and the other plate backward.
 
 This will unlock the connecting plates and allow you to separate the chain.
If you have the most common type of chain, the Shimano- or Campagnolo-
type chain, you’ll need to use a special chain tool to push out one of the 
current pins and push another pin in its place when it’s time to connect it. In 
order to cut the chain, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the chain into the cradle of the chain tool that is farthest 
away from the handle (as shown in Figure 10-11).
 
2. Turn the handle clockwise until the chain tool pin comes in contact 
with the chain rivet, and then stop.
 
 There may be one or more black rivets in the chain from where it was 
last connected. Select an original silver rivet.
 
3. Examine the chain tool pin to make sure it’s lined up with the center 
of the chain rivet.
 
Figure 10-11: 
Preparing to 
separate a 
chain
 

169
 Chapter 10: Hitting the Links: The Chain
 
4. Begin turning the handle to push out the pin.
 
 You may notice that it’s difficult to turn at first.
 
5. Continue turning the handle until the pin falls out.
If you have a chain with reusable rivets, follow the same procedure as for the 
Shimano and Campagnolo chains, but be very careful not to push the pin 
completely out of the link — you’ll use the same pin to reconnect the chain. 
The end of the pin has an expanded surface and you won’t be able to reinstall 
it into the link if you push it completely out.
 
If you have any questions about your chain, consult your owner’s manual or 
visit your local bike shop.
Measuring your new chain
If you buy a new chain, you’ll find that it’s probably much too long for your 
bike — manufacturers sell chains longer than necessary so that they can fit 
a variety of different types of bikes. You need to make sure you’re using the 
proper length chain for your particular bike. If you use a chain that’s too 
short, you won’t be able to shift it into some gears. If you use a chain that’s 
too long, shifting will become sluggish or the chain will start to fall off.
To measure a chain, follow these steps:
 
1. Wind one end of the chain around the smallest cog and through the 
rear derailleur.
 
 Make sure the derailleur is shifted to the smallest cog or the position far-
thest to the outside.
 
2. Wind the other part of the chain through the front derailleur and 
around the largest chainring.
 
 Make sure the front derailleur is shifted to the smallest chainring or the 
farthest gear away from the bike.
 
3. Using a little bit of force, bring both ends of the chain together (as 
shown in Figure 10-12).
 
 This will pull the pulleys of the rear derailleur forward.
 
4. Shorten the chain by hand, one link at a time, until you get the 
correct length.
 
 You know you’re at the right length when there’s approximately 1/2 inch 
to 1 inch of space between the top pulley and the chain.
 
5. On the end of the chain with extra links, pinch the link with your 
thumb and forefinger where you need to cut the chain.
 
 This will help you remember where to break it.

Reassembling your chain
After you’ve repaired and measured your chain, it’s time to reattach it to 
your bike. If you have an SRAM PowerLink-type chain, here’s how:
 
1. After having measured the chain (see the preceding section), remove 
any extra links using the chain tool.
 
2. Grab both connecting pieces that make up the master link.
 
3. Making sure to use inner links only, connect one piece from the inside 
of the chain and another piece from the outside of the chain.
 
4. Press the pins on both pieces through the rollers in the links, and 
snap the master link together (as shown in Figure 10-13).
 
5. Pull the chain to lock the pieces in place.
 
6. Visually examine the master link to make sure it’s securely in place.
If you have a Shimano- or Campagnolo-type chain or a chain with reusable 
rivets, follow these steps:
 
1. After having measured the chain (see the preceding section), remove 
any extra links using the chain tool.
 
2. Making sure to use inner links only, connect one piece from the inside 
of the chain and another piece from the outside of the chain.

3. Where the two ends of the chain come together, insert the replace-
ment pin into the links just far enough to hold the chain together 
while you place it into the chain tool (as shown in Figure 10-14).
 
Figure 10-14: 
Inserting

172
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
 If you have a chain with a reusable rivet, the rivet will already be in place.
 
 The pin has a tapered head that looks like a rocket ship. Make sure you 
insert the pin with the tapered head first. The head of the pin is designed 
to guide the pin into the chain and not to hold the chain together.
 
4. Rotate the handle of the chain tool to press the rivet into the chain.
 
 Be careful not to push the rivet too far into the chain. You want to push 
the tapered head of the rivet all the way through and out the other side 
to have the non-tapered head protruding only as far as the neighboring 
rivets protrude.
 
5. Using pliers, snap the tapered head off the pin (as shown in 
Figure 10-15).
If you have a chain that uses reusable rivets, here’s how to reinstall it:
 
1. Grab both connecting pieces where the chain was broken.
 
2. Join the links together and place into the chain tool.
 
3. Turn the handle of the chain tool until the rivet is pressed into the 
chain.
 
 An equal amount of rivet should be showing on each side of the chain
 
4. Remove the chain tool from the chain.

Gearing Up: Freewheels 
and Cassettes
In This Chapter
▶ Getting clear on cassettes and freewheels
▶ Inspecting, cleaning, and lubricating cassettes and freewheels
▶ Removing and installing cassettes and freewheels
O
ne of the most enjoyable experiences when riding is the exhilaration 
that comes after having reached the top of a tall peak, when the down-
hill begins almost immediately and you’re rewarded with a long descent. The 
satisfaction of having conquered the ascent, the relief of being able to rest 
your legs for a moment, and the rush of coasting at high speed with the wind 
in your face are what keeps people coming back for the climb.
What makes the coasting part possible is the topic of this chapter. 
Freewheels and cassettes are like the clutch on your car — disengage it and 
the car is rolls free in neutral. In a bike’s case, stopping pedaling does the 
trick. In this chapter, we fill you in on some of the basics of how the free-
wheel and cassette work and how coasting is possible, as well as everything 
you need to know about their maintenance, including inspecting, removing, 
and reinstalling them.
The Dirt on Freewheels and Cassettes
Think about a kid’s fixed-gear bike: Every time the rear wheel spins, the 
pedals and cranks rotate with it or the front wheel. For young children, 
this isn’t a big deal — they usually don’t ride very fast, and they have more 
energy than they know what to do with. However, if your bike worked the 
same way and you were riding down a hill at a high rate of speed, your legs 
would have to keep up with the pedals and cranks, which would be spinning 
at a furious rate. Talk about dangerous.

174
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Fortunately, modern bikes have a clutch system that allows you to coast 
when you stop pedaling, and move forward again by pedaling when you slow 
down. This system is made up of either a freewheel or a cassette, the subject 
of this section.
 
To determine whether you have a freewheel or cassette, examine the smallest 
cog. If there is a screw-on lock ring with the word lock on it, which rotates 
with the cogs when you spin the freewheel, you probably have a cassette. If in 
doubt, take your bike to your local bike shop and ask the people there.
What’s so free about a freewheel?
The freewheel (shown in Figure 11-1) is a part of a clutch-like system that was 
a significant advance in the design of bicycles. Older bikes are designed with 
freewheels that consist of individual cogs (toothed disks surrounding the hub 
on your rear wheel that combine to form the freewheel of your bike), bear-
ings, pawls, pawl springs, and gears that are screwed directly on to the hub.
 
Figure 11-1: 
A freewheel
 
One disadvantage to freewheels is that the force from pedaling can tighten 
them, making removal difficult. Another problem with freewheels is that, 
because of the spacing requirements, the bearings on each side of the 
hub are located closer together toward the center of the hub, while the 
axle is extended outward from the bearings to support the freewheel. As a 
result, the axle receives less support and can break or bend under the right 
amount of force.
 
If you have a traditional freewheel, when your cogs wear out you may want to 
think about converting to a cassette system (see the following section). If you 
do opt for a cassette system, your best bet is to replace the hub with a free 
hub. The alternative is to buy a freewheel hub and rebuild your wheel.

175
 Chapter 11: Gearing Up: Freewheels and Cassettes
The best things come in 
packages: The cassette
Cassette systems (see Figure 11-2), which are found on most modern bikes, 
improved many of the deficiencies with freewheels (see the preceding sec-
tion). One of the biggest changes with cassettes is that the ratcheting system 
is built into the hub itself. Cassettes use a free hub, which looks like a tra-
ditional hub but with a thick extension on one side with grooves or splines 
built into it. This design allows the bearings to be spaced farther apart, pro-
viding greater support for the axle.
 
Figure 11-2: 
Cassettes 
improved 
upon free-
wheels.
 
Another advantage of the cassette system is removal: Cassettes have cogs 
that are normally held together as a unit and that slide on and off the hub. 
After the lock ring (which holds the cogs in place) is removed, the cogs slide 
off together as one. Freewheels, on the other hand, are a group of cogs held 
together as a unit but must be threaded onto the hub.
Cassettes come with a variety of different gearing options. The gears are 
defined by the number of teeth on each cog and, depending on your biking 
needs, you may need a specific range of gears. For example, if you’re planning 
on touring, you’ll want high enough gears to help you ascend inclines while 
your bike is weighed down with packed pannier bags.

Some cogs are manufactured with the number of teeth marked on the side. 
These markings will save you from having to count the teeth in order to deter-
mine the gear.
 
If you’re shopping for a cassette, be sure you buy one that’s compatible with 
your hub. Manufacturers like Shimano and Campagnolo have designed cas-
settes that work only with their hubs. If you aren’t sure about which cassette 
will work with your hub, check with the folks at your local bike shop.
Inspecting Your Freewheel or Cassette
Just like other parts of a bike, a freewheel or cassette will eventually wear 
out and have to be replaced. You can identify a worn freewheel the same way 
you identify a worn chainring (see Chapter 10) — by the teeth. Here are some 
clues for identifying worn teeth on a freewheel or cassette:
 
✓ They no longer have sharp edges.
 
✓ They look like they’ve been filed down.
 
✓ They lack symmetry.
 
✓ They have the shape of an ocean wave.
 
If your chain is skipping when you apply force when pedaling, it may be due to 
worn teeth on either the freewheel or cassette cogs or the chainring. Examine 
both and replace them as needed.
Sometimes only one cog will wear out — if this happens, it’s usually the cog 
that corresponds with the gear you use most when riding. (For many bikers, 
this’ll be cogs with 15 to 18 teeth.) If you have just one cog that needs to be 
replaced, you may be able to buy just that one cog — although often buying 
the entire cassette or a freewheel is cheaper.
Cleaning the Freewheel or Cassette
Caring for a freewheel or cassette is pretty straightforward. Unlike other com-
ponents of the bike, where you’re concerned about the internal parts, with 
freewheels your goal is to keep the outside of the cogs clean. Dirt and grime 
quickly work their way onto the surface of the cogs and in between them. 
This buildup can muck up the chain, spread dirt around your bike, and cause 
premature wear for all the parts.
 
You don’t have to remove the freewheel or cassette to clean it.

177
 Chapter 11: Gearing Up: Freewheels and Cassettes
To clean the freewheel or cassette , follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the rear wheel from the bike by following the directions in 
Chapter 7.
 
 Removing the rear wheel gives you better access to the cogs.
 
2. If the freewheel or cassette is very dirty, wash it with soap and water.
 
 Avoid spraying water directly. Use a brush on the freewheel as you wash 
the wheel.
 
3. If the freewheel or cassette is not overly dirty, clean it with a rag.
 
 Drop an edge of the rag between each freewheel cog and, while hold-
ing each corner of the rag with your hands, clean between the cogs in a 
back-and-forth motion.
 
 Dip the cloth or brush in degreaser before using it. But try to keep the 
degreaser from getting on the tire.
 
4. To remove dirt that’s trapped between the cogs, use a narrow brush 
or a screwdriver to scrape it out.
 
 Some manufacturers make a tool with a brush specially designed for this 
purpose.
If the freewheel or cassette is really dirty, try removing and soaking it in a 
degreaser.
Lubricating the Freewheel or Cassette
Although you won’t be overhauling a freewheel or cassette the way you 
would with a bottom bracket or headset, you can do some simple lubrication 
of the bearings using a lightweight oil.
Follow these steps to lubricate the freewheel or cassette while it’s on the wheel:
 
1. After you’ve cleaned the freewheel or cassette (see the preceding sec-
tion), wipe off any excess degreaser and let it dry.
 
2. Lay down the wheel with the freewheel on its side, with the freewheel 
facing up.
 
3. Using a light to medium oil, drip or spray the oil into the gap between 
the freewheel and the center, fixed part of the hub axle, while you’re 
spinning the free hub in a counterclockwise direction.
 
 When you see oil coming through the other side, there is sufficient oil to 
lube the pawls and bearings. (In general, the higher the quality of the 
freewheel, the tighter the tolerances and the longer this takes.)
 
4. Use a rag to wipe off any excess lubrication between the cogs.

178
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
Removing a Freewheel or Cassette
You’ll have to remove a freewheel or cassette in the following situations:
 
✓ If you’re replacing the freewheel or cassette
 
✓ If you’re replacing a spoke and need to insert it into the flange (the part 
that flares out at the ends of the hubs)
 
✓ If you’re overhauling the hubs
 
✓ If you’re replacing the hubs
In the following sections, we walk you through removing a freewheel and 
removing a cassette, as well as removing individual cogs and removing the 
free hub.
Removing a freewheel
If your bike has a freewheel, follow these steps to remove it. (If you’re not 
sure whether your bike has a freewheel or cassette, turn to “The Dirt on 
Freewheels and Cassettes,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
1. Remove the rear wheel from the bike (see Chapter 7).
 
2. Remove the quick-release skewer or axle nut.
 
3. Stand the wheel up on the floor.
 
4. Attach the freewheel remover tool to the center of the freewheel.
 
 Be sure to use the correct type of freewheel remover tool. Check with 
your local bike shop or read your bike owner’s manual to find out which 
model is appropriate for your freewheel.
 
 To hold the freewheel removal tool in place, use the axle nut or insert 
the quick-release skewer through the center of the tool and tighten the 
nut to hold it in place.
 
5. Using an adjustable wrench, turn the freewheel remover in a counter-
clockwise direction.
 
6. When the freewheel remover loosens, remove the quick-release 
skewer or axle nut.
 
7. Continue to unscrew the freewheel remover either by hand or with 
the wrench, until the freewheel is unthreaded from the hub.
 
Removing a freewheel, which tightens at every pedal stroke, can often be 
extremely difficult. If you can’t remove it with a full-size crescent wrench, 
more leverage is needed. You may be able to use an extension pipe or, more

 Chapter 11: Gearing Up: Freewheels and Cassettes
effectively, a heavy-duty vice (maybe borrowed from your local bike shop). 
Being unable to remove a freewheel is a very common frustration of home 
mechanics.
Removing a cassette
Most modern cassettes are designed to slide onto the free-hub body with 
splines and then be held in place by a cassette lockring. On some older cas-
settes, the cassette is secured to the hub by the first cog.
To determine which type of cassette you have, look at the first cog. If it has 
grooves or splines cut into the center of it, you have the lockring style. If not, 
you have the older cassette style. (When in doubt, check with the people at 
your local bike shop.)
 
On many lockrings, you can sometimes find the word lock with an arrow point-
ing in the direction for locking.
In order to remove a splined cassette, you need a freewheel removal tool, a 
chain whip, and an adjustable crescent wrench. If you have a traditional cas-
sette, you’ll need two chain whips.
 
Different types of cassettes require freewheel removers that are specially 
designed to work with the number of splines in the hub. Make sure you pur-
chase one that’s compatible with your cassette.
Splined cassettes
To remove a modern-style, splined cassette, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the rear wheel from the bike (see Chapter 7).
 
2. Remove the quick-release skewer or axle nut.
 
3. Stand the wheel up on the floor.
 
4. Insert the freewheel remover to the center of the cassette (as shown in 
Figure 11-3).
 
 To hold the lockring in place, insert the quick-release skewer through 
the center of the tool and lightly tighten the nut to hold it in place. You 
can do the same thing with the axle nut if you have axle nuts instead of a 
quick release.
 
5. Wrap the chain of the chain-whip tool around one of the larger cogs.
 
6. Secure an adjustable wrench to the flat edges of the freewheel tool.

7. Holding the chain-whip tool in one hand and the adjustable wrench 
in the other (as shown in Figure 11-4), push down on the adjustable 
wrench.
 
 You’ll hear a clicking sound as the lockring loosens.
 
 You may be able to get greater leverage by standing behind the wheel 
and leaning over the top as you push down on the wrench.
 
8. After the lockring loosens, remove the nut or quick-release skewer.
 
9. Unscrew the lockring by hand until you can remove it.
 
10. Slide the cassette off the freehub.
 
 Some of the first few cogs may not be attached to the cassette body (as 
shown in Figure 11-5). Keep track of any spacers that exist in between 
the cogs — these should be returned to their proper position when you 
reinstall the cassette.
Figure 11-6 shows the free hub after the cassette is removed. Notice the 
splines cut into the extended part of the hub.

Traditional cassettes
To remove a traditional cassette, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the rear wheel from the bike (see Chapter 7).
 
2. Remove the quick-release skewer or axle nut.
 
3. Stand the wheel up on the floor.
 
4. Facing the cassette, attach the chain of one chain whip to the largest 
cog and hold the handle of the chain whip with your right hand at the 
two or three o’clock position.
 
5. Attach the chain of the other chain whip to the smallest cog and sup-
port the tool with your left hand in the nine or ten o’clock position.
 
6. Push down on the chain attached to the smallest cog while holding 
the other chain whip in place.
 
 You may be able to get greater leverage by standing behind the wheel 
and leaning over the top as you push down on the chain whip.
 
7. Remove the smallest cog after it’s loose.
 
 The others will slide off.

183
 Chapter 11: Gearing Up: Freewheels and Cassettes
Removing individual the cogs 
on a freewheel or cassette
Occasionally, you may decide to replace an individual cog because of wear or 
because you want to change its size. After you’ve removed your freewheel or 
cassette, you can follow these steps to remove individuals cogs:
 
1. Secure the freewheel or cassette in a vise (as shown in Figure 11-7).
 
2. Wrap the chain of a chain whip around the smallest cog.
 
3. Turn the chain whip in a counterclockwise direction to remove the 
cog (as shown in Figure 11-8).

Preparing 
to remove 
individual 
freewheels.
 

184
Part II: Basic Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 11-8:

cog from a 
freewheel.
 
 
If you don’t have a vise, you can use two chain whips together:
 
1. Wrap the chains of the chain whip around two adjacent cogs such that 
the handles of the tools cross.
 
 You’ll have more leverage if you keep the handles close together.
 
2. Squeeze together the two chain whips until you loosen the cogs.
 
 This procedure is shown in Figure 11-9.
 
Whichever method you choose, as you remove the cogs keep track of any 
spacers (see Figure 11-10) between them. You’ll want to put these back in 
place in the proper order when your reinstall the freewheel.

Removing the free-hub body
If the free-hub body’s ratcheting mechanism gives out or if it’s making noise, 
you may have to replace it or remove it for lubrication if you have a model 
that allows for this.
To remove the freehub body, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the rear wheel from the bike (see Chapter 7).
 
2. Remove the cassette from the free hub (see “Removing a cassette,” 
earlier in this chapter).
 
3. Remove the lock nut and cone from the other side of wheel and pull 
the axle through.
 
4. Remove the hub bearings.
 
 Replace them if necessary.
 
5. Use the proper size Allen wrench to unscrew the bolt in the center of 
the free-hub body and remove the free-hub body.
 
6. Clean the body with a degreaser, apply oil, wipe off any excess lubri-
cation, and reassemble using the reverse of this procedure.

Installing a Freewheel or Cassette
To install a freewheel, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply grease to the threads on the inside of the freewheel and to 
those on the hub.
 
2. Thread the freewheel in a clockwise direction, being careful to make 
sure that the threads align properly.
 
3. Thread the freewheel by hand until it begins to tighten.
 
 You can use a chain whip to tighten the freewheel further, although this 
usually isn’t necessary because riding the bike will tighten it.

187
 Chapter 11: Gearing Up: Freewheels and Cassettes
To install a cassette, following these steps:
 
1. Slide the cassette onto the body of the free hub.
 
 Find the one spline on the freehub that is wider than the others, and 
align it with the same wide spline on the inside of the cassette.
 
2. Slide any smaller individual cogs onto the hub.
 
 If there are spacers be sure to include them in the proper position.
 
3. Grease the threads of the lockring and screw it into place on the hub.
 
4. Attach the freewheel remover to the center of the cassette.
 
5. Insert the quick-release skewer into the center of the hub, and tighten 
the nut to hold it in place.
 
6. Using an adjustable wrench, turn the freewheel remover in a clock-
wise direction to tighten.
 
 After you hand-tighten the lockring, you only need to tighten the 
lockring about five to ten clicks with the tool. Do not overtighten.

f you’re planning on overhauling your bike, replacing 
some of its components, or performing major repairs, 
this part is for you. Here we focus on several “systems,” 
including the frame and suspension, the drivetrain, the 
steering system, and the shifting system. Although these 
procedures are more advanced than those in Part II, with 
this book by your side, you can do these yourself as long 
as you have the right tools — and patience. After you 
tackle the repairs in these chapters, you’ll be chatting up 
your local bike-shop mechanic, watching the Tour de 
France with a new appreciation, and impressing your 
friends with your mastery of bike repair and maintenance.

Holding It All Together: 
The Frame and Suspension

▶ Knowing what to look for in a frame
▶ Inspecting a frame for problems
▶ Identifying the different types of suspension
▶ Adjusting and maintaining your suspension
F
or all the focus given to other parts of the bike when it comes to 
improving comfort and bike handling, the frame is given surprisingly 
little attention, especially considering how important it is to your bike. The 
frame dramatically impacts the personality of your bike — its stability, how 
it handles corners, whether it can carry loads, and how aerodynamic it is. It 
also determines your position on the bike in relation to the pedals, the seat, 
and the handlebars. Slight changes in this position can greatly impact the 
way a bike rides.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the frame and how it impacts the 
biking experience. We discuss how frames are designed and constructed and 
what qualities you should look for when shopping for a new frame. We also 
provide advice for inspecting and maintaining your frame.
We also discuss bike suspension in this chapter. The suspension acts as an 
extension of the frame by being an intermediary between the road and the 
bike to absorb the bumps and jars so your frame and body won’t have to. 
Suspension is found on more and more bikes these days, so understanding 
how suspension works and the steps to adjust and care for it is a good idea — 
if your current bike doesn’t have suspension, your next one just might.

I’ve Been Framed: Your Bike’s Frame
Although there are a number of different frame designs, some more strange 
than others, the diamond shape is most popular. In this design, there is a 
main triangle that includes the following:
 
✓ Head tube: The head tube is where the fork connects with the frame and 
where the headset sits to enable steering.
 
✓ Top tube: The top tube connects the seat tube with the head tube and 
can be horizontal or angled up or down, depending on the style of the 
bike. Cables are frequently run along the top tube.
 
✓ Down tube: The down tube connects the head tube with the bottom 
bracket. This is where your water-bottle cage usually goes. On older 
bikes, this was the location for the friction shifters.
 
✓ Seat tube: The seat tube is what supports your butt by holding the seat 
post and saddle in place. It’s often used for attaching water-bottle cages 
and bike pumps.
 
✓ Bottom-bracket shell: This is a short, fat tube that holds the bottom 
bracket. It runs sideways across the bottom of the bike and is usually 
threaded.
There also is a rear triangle, which consists of the seat tube, along with the 
following:
 
✓ Chain stays: Chain stays run parallel to the bike chain and connect the 
bottom bracket to the rear dropouts. On some bikes, cables are routed 
along the chain stays.
 
✓ Seat stays: The seat stays connect the seat tube with the rear dropouts. 
They’re often used for mounting brakes, fenders, or bike racks.
The final section of the frame is the fork and steerer tube. The fork is how the 
front wheel connects to the bike. It consists of two legs with a dropout each 
for the wheel and a steerer tube, which inserts into the head tube.
A number of factors in the geometry of a frame affect how the bike handles:
 
✓ Seat-tube angle: The seat-tube angle is based on the angle of the seat 
tube in relation to the ground. This angle determines how your weight is 
distributed between the saddle and the handlebars. A steeper seat tube 
creates a more aerodynamic position with more of your weight shifted 
forward to the handlebars. With a shallower seat tube, the saddle 
is positioned farther behind the bottom bracket and your weight is 
directed toward the back of the bike.

193
 Chapter 12: Holding It All Together: The Frame and Suspension
 
 The angle of the seat tube also impacts how you pedal, because it 
changes your position in relation to the bottom bracket, where all the 
pedaling takes place. A steeper seat-tube position provides a more 
direct transfer of power from your legs and is better for higher-cadence 
pedaling. A shallower seat tube is better for slower pedaling, such as 
climbing while seated.
 
✓ Head-tube angle: The head-tube angle impacts your bike’s handling. 
A steeper head tube will provide more responsive steering, whereas a 
more shallow tube will give you more relaxed steering. If you use your 
bike on mountain trails and need quick, responsive turning to avoid hit-
ting objects, a steeper head tube is for you. On the other hand, if your 
riding consists of taking two-week tours where you’re on long stretches 
of road for hours at a time, a more shallow seat tube is probably the 
way to go.
 
✓ Chain-stay length: Chain-stay length also impacts a bike’s handling. A 
shorter chain stay brings the wheel closer to the bottom bracket and 
makes the bike’s handling more responsive. For racing and perfor-
mance, a shorter chain stay won’t allow the frame to flex as much, so 
more of your pedaling energy is transferred to the rear wheel. In addi-
tion, because more of your body is above the rear wheel, traction is 
improved, which is useful on mountain bikes.
 
 A longer chain stay flexes more and provides a larger wheel base, which 
improves stability and comfort. Longer chain stays are found on many 
touring bike frames, where stability for a loaded bike is important. 
Having the wheel farther back also helps keep your foot from hitting the 
pannier bags.
 
✓ Bottom-bracket drop: The bottom-bracket drop is how far the bottom 
bracket sits below an imaginary horizontal line drawn between the front 
and rear dropouts. Most mountain bikes have less of a bottom-bracket 
drop because they need the extra clearance to avoid the obstacles found 
on trails. Racing bikes also are designed with less of a bottom-bracket 
drop to prevent the pedals from hitting the road in tight corners. An 
increased bottom-bracket drop extends the wheelbase and lowers the 
bike’s center of gravity, both of which improve stability. As you may 
expect, a lower bottom-bracket drop is found on touring bikes where 
stability is valued.
So how do all these frame options come together to form the bike that’s 
perfect for you? For the average rider, bike frames designed with comfort 
and stability in mind are probably going to be the best choice. Frames with 
slightly longer chain stays, lower bottom-bracket drops, and more relaxed 
seat-tube and head-tube angles provide this. For mountain bikes and more 
expensive road bikes, the tendency will be for more responsive and stiffer 
rides with frames that have shorter chain stays, higher bottom-bracket 
drops, and steeper seat-tube and head-tube angles.

194

Figure 12-1 illustrates a mountain bike frame and Figure 12-2 shows a road-
bike frame. See if you can notice some of the differences between the two 
frames: The mountain bike has a shorter chain stay, a higher bottom bracket, 
and steeper seat tube and head tubes than the road bike.

What to look for in a frame
Frame materials are often compared based on the qualities of strength, stiff-
ness, and weight:

195
 Chapter 12: Holding It All Together: The Frame and Suspension
 
✓ Strength: Strength refers to the durability of the frame. If you crashed, 
a stronger frame would be more likely to survive the crash intact. For 
a mountain bike that’s going to be put through some challenging trail 
rides, strength is important.
 
✓ Stiffness: Stiffness describes how much the frame material flexes under 
a force. For example, when you pedal, you’re applying a force to the 
frame; around the bottom bracket, it’ll flex slightly depending on the 
frame material.
 
✓ Weight: Weight is an important factor with frame materials. In an ideal 
world, you’d have the lightest frame possible so on your next climb 
it wouldn’t feel like you were hauling a sack of potatoes with you. Of 
course, lighter frames require more expensive materials, which makes 
them cost prohibitive for some riders.
Types of frame materials
The most common frame materials are
 
✓ Steel: Steel frames have been around for a long time, and the best of 
them can still compete with some of today’s frames fashioned from 
fancier materials. The higher-end steels or steel/alloy blends (such as 
chrome-moly) are very strong, offer significant stiffness, and are long 
lasting, all for decent prices. Cheaper, mild steels or high-tensile steel 
are found on lower-end bikes where the frames are thick and heavy.
 
 The downside to steel, other than the weight, is that it can rust. Also, 
high-tensile or mild steel is very uncomfortable — all the road vibra-
tions are transferred through the frame to your butt. The better-quality 
chrome-moly frames with butted tubing are much more comfortable 
than the mild steel.
 
✓ Aluminum: Aluminum has become the most popular choice for manu-
facturers of bike frames. It’s lighter than steel, has better stiffness, and, 
unlike steel, it doesn’t rust. The other benefit of aluminum is that it can 
be easily formed into different shapes to improve the performance and 
aerodynamics of the frame. The downside of aluminum is that it’s not 
as strong as steel, so a big-time crash could leave your frame mangled 
beyond repair. The other factor with aluminum is that it fatigues over 
time, increasing the chances that the frame could break. Aluminum also 
transmits road vibration far more severely then steel or carbon fiber.

196
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
✓ Carbon fiber: Carbon-fiber frames are made by gluing, with an epoxy 
resin, individual carbon-fiber sheets together in patterns that enhance 
its strength. Manufacturers use this technique to customize frame 
strength by adding layers of fibers to the parts of the frame that require 
greater strength, and removing layers of fibers from the parts of the 
frame that doesn’t need as much strength.
 
 The fact that carbon is strong and light makes it a desirable material for 
frames. However, carbon fiber is expensive. Carbon-fiber frames offer 
the most comfortable ride with the most efficient use of energy. The 
other nice thing about carbon fiber is that the frame can be made in 
almost any shape or size. Manufacturers aren’t limited to the standard 
tube sizes or the typical rounded shape of a frame tube.
 
✓ Titanium: Titanium, like carbon, is on every serious biker’s wish list 
when it comes to frame materials. Titanium is light, it doesn’t rust, and 
it’s as strong as most steels. It’s less stiff than steel and flexes to give a 
comfortable ride. Unfortunately, titanium is very expensive and out of 
reach for most bikers.
Inspecting your frame
Even though the frame may appear to be one solid, immovable object, it’s 
not unheard of for them to go out of alignment occasionally. Any kind of 
impact — whether it’s an accident, your bike falling over, or jumping your 
bike over a curb — could impact the alignment.
To inspect your frame for issues, follow these steps:
 
1. Stand in front of your bike and peer down the center of the frame (as 
shown in Figure 12-3).
 
 You should see the head tube line up with the seat tube.
 
2. Facing forward, straddle your bike with both legs and look down at 
the frame (as shown in Figure 12-4).
 
 You should see the top tube line up with the down tube. The front forks 
should also be equidistant apart from each side of the wheel.
 
3. Stand behind the bike and check that the seat tube lines up with the 
head tube (see Figure 12-5). Look down at the seat stays and make 
sure they are parallel.

4. Visually inspect the frame for defects (as shown in Figure 12-6).
 
 Pay particular attention to where the frame is welded together. For hard-
to-see places, close your eyes and run your fingers along the side of the 
tube. (Closing your eyes allows you to actually feel and not have your 
eyes trick your brain.) If you see or feel bubbles, ripples, or cracks in the 
paint, it could be a sign that your frame has issues. Take it to your local 
bike shop for further inspection.
 
5. Tie a string to the rear dropout on one side, and run it toward the 
front of the bicycle head tube and then back to the dropout on the 
other side and tie it.
 
 Measure the distance from the string to the seat tube on each side. If the 
measurement’s are not exactly the same, your frame is bent and out of 
alignment.
 
If you think your bike is out of alignment, take it to your local bike shop. Many 
shops have tools that can check the alignment and straighten the frame as 
needed. If your frame is made of steel, repairing it is usually much easier than 
if you have an aluminum, carbon, or titanium frame. If your frame is not made 
of steel, your best bet might be to turn to your bike’s warranty.

Maintaining your frame
In general, the frame is one of the lowest-maintenance parts of your bike. 
Nevertheless, you shouldn’t ignore it when you care for your bike — there 
are a number of things you can do to make sure it lasts as long as the manu-
facturer intended. We cover these basic maintenance tasks in this section.
Preventing rust
For steel frames, rust is the number-one enemy. Water from rain, sweat, or 
muddy conditions can work itself into the frame and start corroding it. To 
minimize the chances of this happening, spray an anti-rust product, such as 
WD-40, into the frame every opportunity you have.

200
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
If you’re really serious about protecting your frame, you can try one of a 
number of rust-inhibitor products (such as J. P. Weigle’s Frame Saver, avail-
able at bike shops). When you spray a rust inhibitor inside a frame, it forms a 
barrier that protects against rust.
Painting your frame
Keeping your frame painted can go a long way toward preventing rust. Small 
chips in the frame’s paint may allow rust to take root in your frame and 
spread. If you have time on your hands during the winter months, give your 
bike a fresh coat of paint as part of its annual overhaul. At the very least, 
touch up any small chips in the paint so that they don’t become sources of 
rust. If rust has already appeared, use a fine-grain sandpaper to remove the 
rust before painting.
 
Most bicycle manufacturers don’t make touch-up paint available, so use a sim-
ilar color automotive touch-up paint from an auto dealer or auto parts store.
Try to keep paint chips to a minimum:
 
✓ Use chainstay protectors to protect your chainstay against impact from 
the chain.
 
✓ Use O-rings on cables to keep them from rubbing against the frame’s 
surface.
 
✓ Where cables come in contact with the frame, place a small piece of tape 
between the cable and the frame, to protect the frame’s surface.
Butt out! Frame butting
When it comes to crafting bike frames, manu-
facturers have more tricks up their sleeves than 
just changing the frame material. Engineers 
have come up with a variety of ways to manip-
ulate strength and rigidity of frames, including 
changing the tube width, the thickness of tube 
walls, and the tube shape.
Butting is one such technique. It’s the process 
of making one part of a tube thicker than another 
part of the same tube. This is usually done on 
the inside walls of the tube, so the outside — 
the part that you see — is all the same. The 
thicker part of the tube provides strength where 
it’s needed more, and the thinner part of the 
tube helps reduce weight. Single-butted tubes 
have one side of the tube that’s thicker than the 
other. They’re often found on seat tubes where 
the thicker part of the tube is attached to the 
bottom bracket to provide support against the 
force of pedaling. Double-butted tubing is thin in 
the middle, where less strength is needed, and 
thicker on both ends, where the tube connects 
to other tubes. On some frames, manufactur-
ers may even use triple- or quadruple-butted 
tubes.

Waxing your frame
Waxing is not only a great way to keep your bike looking shiny and new, it’s 
effective at keeping rust at bay. Give your bike a thorough waxing as a part of 
your annual overhaul, when the frame will be more accessible. If you ride a 
lot, think about waxing the frame every few months.
 
Although there are a number of waxes designed for bikes, any all-purpose car 
wax should do the trick.
Suspended in Disbelief: The Suspension
In the continuing trend toward bikes offering a more comfortable ride, 
suspension has played a leading role. Riding a bike without suspension on 
a rough road makes you feel like you’re the shock absorber. Every road or 
trail shock that hits a stiff rigid bike is transferred directly into your arms, 
legs, and the rest of your body. Not only that, but if you hit something on 
the road or trail with enough force, the bike may stop suddenly and send 
you flying like Superman.
On a bike with suspension, when you hit a pothole or run over a rock, the 
shock absorber dissipates the force before it’s absorbed by your bike and 
body. It improves safety, comfort, and riding efficiency (because you won’t 
have to hover over your seat to act as your own personal shock absorber). 
Bicycles with suspension are safer because they give you more control of the 
bicycle — the wheels stay in contact with the ground more and you don’t get 
bounced around on the trail as much.
The main idea behind suspension is that the coiling of a spring keeps you float-
ing or suspended when you ride. This provides the bounciness or springiness 
of the suspension. The second idea is that the bounciness of the spring is better 
suited for a bike if it can be controlled or dampened. A spring with too much 
bounce will make you feel as though your bike is attached to a pogo stick.
Suspension is generally found on four places on a bike:
 
✓ Fork
 
✓ Stem
 
✓ Seat post
 
✓ Rear axle

Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
Types of suspension
Most suspension systems use some type of spring to absorb impacts from 
the road. Generally, three types of springs are used:
 
✓ Coil: Coil springs are made from steel of different gauges and are the 
most popular type of spring.
 
✓ Air: Air maintained inside a sealed chamber acts as another kind of spring.
 
✓ Elastomer: Elastomers are made of urethane and aren’t as common 
these days as they were in the past.
Suspension works best when a spring is paired with some kind of damp-
ing system. Damping is the ability to slow the rebound of the suspension. 
Rebound is the speed at which the suspension returns to its original position 
after it has been compressed. And compression is the amount of time it takes 
for the suspension to absorb your weight. If your suspension has unchecked 
rebound, you’ll feel like you’re riding a bouncing ball. If your suspension has 
the bouncing-ball feeling, adjusting the damping can reduce the speed at 
which the suspension compresses and rebounds.
Air and oil are two types of damping systems. In an air-based damping 
system, air pressure is adjusted to change the amount of damping. In oil-
based damping systems, a piston flows through a volume of oil. Adjusting the 
size of the hole in the piston changes the amount of damping.
Many suspension systems have adjusters that allow you to change the amount 
of damping and preload (the amount of compression applied to suspension 
before it supports any weight). By preloading the suspension, it will sag less 
and give you a stiffer ride. Reducing the preload will cause the suspension to 
sag more. On many suspension forks, the preload adjuster is found on the top 
of the fork and the damping adjustment at the bottom of the fork.
Tuning the suspension
Although there are a number of ways to tune suspension, we’ll focus on one 
of the most basic adjustments — controlling the amount of sag (the amount 
of movement in the suspension when you’re sitting on your saddle). The 
amount of recommended sag for most bikes is normally around 25 percent.

203
 Chapter 12: Holding It All Together: The Frame and Suspension
 
You can adjust the suspension much easier if you have a friend around to 
assist you.
To adjust the rear suspension sag, follow these steps:
 
1. For a coiled-spring-covered shock, determine the amount of travel (the 
total range that the suspension can move) by measuring the length of 
the coil when it’s fully extended, without any weight on the bike.
 
 Suspension on the front forks usually has a greater travel than the 
rear suspension. Too much travel is not a good thing — it can damage 
your suspension by causing it to bottom out.
 
2. Sit on you bike while it’s stationary and don’t touch the ground with 
your feet.
 
 Have your friend support you if needed.
 
3. Measure the length of the coil to determine the amount of sag.
 
4. Divide the measurement from Step 3 by the measurement from Step 1, 
to determine the percentage of sag.
 
 For example, if the amount of travel was 4 inches and your sag was 1 
inch, the percentage of sag is 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25, or 25 percent.
 
 If your sag is less than 25 percent, the suspension is too stiff. Proceed to 
Step 5.
 
 If your sag is more than 30 percent, the suspension is too soft. Proceed 
to Step 6.
 
5. Adjust the spring tension in front by rotating the spring seat (as shown 
in Figure 12-7). To reduce tension and increase sag, turn the knob 
counterclockwise one turn.
 
 Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sag is between 25 percent and 30 
percent.
 
6. Adjust the spring tension in front by rotating the spring seat (refer to 
Figure 12-7). To increase tension and reduce sag, turn the spring seat 
clockwise one turn.
 
 Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sag is between 25 percent and 30 
percent.

204
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 12-7: 
Adjusting 
rear sus-
pension.
 
To adjust the front suspension sag, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the total amount of travel by measuring from the top part 
of your forks to the seal of the forks or the lowest part of the shock 
that moves relative to the rest of the bike.
 
2. Sit on you bike while it’s stationary and don’t touch the ground with 
your feet.
 
 Have your friend support you if needed.
 
3. Measure the distance between the two points again to determine the 
amount of sag.
 
4. Divide the measurement from Step 3 by the measurement from Step 1, 
to determine the percentage of sag.
 
 For example, if the amount of travel was 4 inches and your sag was 1 
inch, the percentage of sag is 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25, or 25 percent.
 
 If the sag was less than 25 percent, the forks are too stiff. Proceed to 
Step 5.
 
 If the sage was more than 30 percent, the forks are too soft. Proceed to 
Step 6.

205
 Chapter 12: Holding It All Together: The Frame and Suspension
 
5. Adjust the spring tension in front by rotating your screw knob on 
the top of your fork (as shown in Figure 12-8). To reduce tension and 
increase sag, turn the knob counterclockwise one turn.
 
 Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sag is between 25 percent and 30 
percent.
 
6. Adjust the spring tension in front by rotating your screw knob on the 
top of your fork (refer to Figure 12-8). To increase tension and reduce 
sag, turn the knob clockwise one turn.
 
 Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the sag is between 25 percent and 30 
percent.
 
If your friends have deserted you for the day, do the same process except use 
a zip tie around the fork instead of just eyeballing or measuring by hand. Use 
it to get the total travel and then reset it to get the sag. This gives you a more 
accurate measurement and is easier to perform.

Maintaining the suspension
How to maintain a bike’s suspension varies depending on the type of suspen-
sion. Suspension systems that use oil need more attention and maintenance 
than those that used coil-based springs. Follow your bike’s owner’s manual 
for how to maintain the suspension properly.
 
One of the most important things you can do for your suspension is to keep it 
clean. Disassemble your forks regularly and according to the recommended 
timeframe in the owner’s manual. (Figure 12-9 shows a disassembled suspen-
sion fork.) As a part of your annual overhaul, you’ll want to disassemble the 
forks and replace seals, wipers, and bushings.
Also, regularly inspect your bike’s suspension for signs of oil leaks. If you 
notice a leak, you should replace the seals as soon as possible.

Putting the Pedal to the 
Metal: The Drivetrain
In This Chapter
▶ Working on pedals
▶ Removing and installing crank arms
▶ Dealing with chainrings
▶ Handling the bottom bracket
T
he drivetrain is sort of like your bike’s transmission. It converts energy 
from your legs into mechanical force to power you forward. The drive-
train starts with pedals attached to the bike’s crank arms, which are mounted 
to the frame by the bottom bracket. Moving the pedals begins a process that 
drives your energy through the chain to the back wheel, moving the bicycle 
forward down the trail. In this chapter, we explain how to remove, install, and 
overhaul each of the components that make up the drivetrain.
 
Working on the drivetrain is not overly complicated, but it does require some 
special tools, including special wrenches, bottom bracket tools, crank-arm 
extractors, and so on. If you’re committed to a long-term relationship with 
your bike and want to do your own repair and maintenance, purchasing these 
tools will be a good investment. Otherwise, when it comes time to overhaul 
these parts, you can always take your bike to your local bike shop and let the 
experts there handle the job.
Putting the Pedal to the Metal
The pedals are an important link in the transfer of power from your legs to 
your bike. However, if you were buying a new bike, you wouldn’t get that 
impression because manufacturers sometimes install the cheapest, most 
low-end pedals possible.

208
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
Dennis recently bought a new road bike for his wife. To look at it was to 
admire a work of art . . . except for the ugly, thick, rubber pedals attached to 
the cranks, which looked as if they were taken from a child’s bike.
Manufacturers use cheap pedals because many bicyclists develop personal 
preferences for certain types of pedals and, when they buy a new bicycle, 
they have their old pedals mounted on their new bikes — or buy a new set 
of pedals.
In this section, we show you what to look for in new pedals and tell you how 
to keep your pedals working well.
Shopping for new pedals
There are many different pedal styles on the market. The traditional style 
pedals are flat. Other styles have binding systems that allow you to strap 
your foot to the pedal with a toe clip and strap or lock your shoe into the 
pedal with a clipless pedal.
 
Many casual riders think that having their feet attached to the pedal would be 
uncomfortable or worry that disengaging their feet would be difficult. On 
the contrary, toe clips or clipless pedals are easy to manage, and they offer 
significant gains in performance.
On most pedals, you can attach a toe clip and strap, which helps prevent 
your foot from slipping off the pedal and keeps the ball of your foot centered 
over the pedal, which improves the efficiency of your pedaling. Toe clips 
include a buckle that allows you to adjust the strap so that it can fit a variety 
of shoe types and sizes. Because you can wear any type of shoe with them, 
these are especially nice if you’re a casual rider and like to get off your bike 
occasionally and sightsee or just walk around.
Another option is to go with clipless pedals, which are similar to ski bindings. 
They’re designed to grab a cleat built into the bottom of specially designed 
biking shoes. These pedals hold your foot in place while you pedal, greatly 
increasing your pedaling efficiency. Snapping your shoe into the pedal is a 
breeze, and unlocking the cleat and removing your shoe from the pedal is a 
quick, natural movement with an outward twist of your heel.
There are a number of different clipless systems on the market each with a 
slightly different method for locking the cleat into the pedal. If you’re buying 
biking shoes, make sure you check them for their compatibility with your 
pedals, and vice versa.

209
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
 
If you’re worried about whether you’ll be able to unlock the cleat from the 
pedal quickly enough in an emergency, don’t be. We can pull our shoes off 
the pedals faster with clipless pedals than we can with toe clips. Plus, clipless 
pedals are usually designed with a tension adjustment — usually a small bolt 
that’s turned clockwise to increase tension and counterclockwise to reduce 
tension. If you find that the cleat in your shoe is a little difficult to remove, try 
adjusting the tension. Practice getting in and out of your clipless pedals a few 
times before you ride so that you don’t come to your first stop and fall over 
with your shoes locked into your pedals.
If you opt for clipless pedals, you’ll want to adjust them to the pedaling posi-
tion that is most natural for you. Many shoes allow you to move the position 
of the cleat. In addition, some pedal systems provide for some movement or 
float after the cleat locks into the pedal — this gives your feet some ability to 
move on the pedal, which reduces tension and stress on the knees and keeps 
you from staying in one position during your ride.
 
Talk to the staff in your local bike shop to find the right adjustment for your 
pedaling system. This will help ensure that you don’t end up locking your 
shoes into pedals in a position that’s unnatural for your body and puts strain 
on your legs when you bike.
Identifying worn-out pedals
Pedals are often subject to a lot of abuse. Not only do they absorb energy 
from your body, but they’re low to the ground and away from the center of 
the bike, which means they’re often exposed to harsher conditions than the 
rest of the bike.
If you’re hearing creaking or grating sounds or noticing any general looseness 
when you rotate the pedals, they may need to be replaced. Be sure to isolate 
the sounds or looseness to the pedals and not the bottom bracket before you 
start spending money replacing parts.
Removing pedals
Pedals can sometimes be difficult to remove. They’re usually torqued 
pretty well because the pedaling motion gradually tightens the screws. If 
your pedals haven’t been removed for a while, or if not much grease was 
applied the last time they were installed, this may make it harder for you to 
remove them.
 
Keep in mind that the threads for the left pedal (the left side as you’re sitting 
on the bicycle — usually the non-chainring side) is reversed. Both pedals 
loosen by moving the wrench toward the back of the bike, and both pedals 
tighten by moving toward the front of the bike. In other words, forward pedal 
motion tightens, and reverse pedal motion loosens.

210
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
Pedals are designed this way so that when you pedal, the thread doesn’t 
come loose.
 
The best way to remove a pedal is to use a pedal wrench, which allows you to 
get a firm fit on the wrench flats, as shown in Figure 13-1.
Follow these steps to remove your pedals:
 
1. Spray some penetrating oil into the pedal where the threads are 
screwed into the cranks.
 
 Allow the oil to work itself into the threads for a few minutes.
 
2. Rotate the crank arms into a three o’clock and nine o’clock position.
 
3. Using a pedal wrench, hold the crank arm steady, and unscrew the 
right pedal from the crank in a counterclockwise direction.
 
4. Repeat Step 3, except unscrew the left pedal in a clockwise direction.
If you have trouble loosening the pedals, here are some tips to try:
 
✓ Slide a piece of pipe over the end of the wrench (as shown in Figure 
13-2), effectively extending the length of the wrench, which will give you 
more leverage and increase the amount of force you can apply.
Figure 13-1:

a pedal 
wrench to 
remove a 
pedal.
 

211
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
Figure 13-2:

for leverage.
 
 
✓ Remove the crank arm and then secure it with a vise. In this manner, 
you won’t have to worry about the crank arms moving while you try to 
loosen the pedal. Place a soft cloth around the crank arm so you don’t 
damage or scratch it.
 
Be careful when trying to free a tight pedal. It’s very easy for the wrench, the 
crankarm, or your hand to slip while you’re applying force, which could cause 
you to smack your hand or arm against your bike. Wear a pair of work gloves 
to save your knuckles from being scuffed up on the chainrings.
Overhauling the pedals
Pedals depend on internal bearings to spin smoothly. Over time, the bearings 
wear out causing the pedals to spin less smoothly, which reduces perfor-
mance. This section describes some steps you can take to overhaul the 

212
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
pedals. For cheaper pedals, overhauling isn’t an option, because they’re 
made too cheaply to be serviceable. For higher-quality pedals, an overhaul 
is a good way to extend their life.
 
As you take apart the pedal, place each component on a clean flat surface in 
the order it was removed. This will help you reinstall the components in the 
correct order.
Here’s how to overhaul your pedals:
 
1. If the pedal has a flat medal cage, remove it before beginning to 
overhaul the pedals.
 
 This will make working with the pedal easier. There should be several 
screws holding it in place, which can be removed with a screwdriver or 
Allen wrench.
 
2. Remove the dust cap with a small flathead screwdriver.
 
 Be careful not to damage the dust cap.
 
3. Loosen the locknut under the dust cap, holding everything in place.
 
 To reach the locknut, you may be need to use a socket wrench.
 
4. If there is a washer in place, remove it.
 
 If the washer is difficult to lift out, use a flathead screwdriver or needle-
nose pliers.
 
5. Remove the cone that is holding the bearings in place.
 
 The cone may lift out or need to be unthreaded with a screwdriver or 
needle-nose pliers.
 
 Make sure you’re supporting the axle. If the axle drops out, the bearings 
will fall out and you’ll be searching for them on the floor for hours.
 
6. Scoop out all the bearings and inspect their surfaces.
 
 If they’re dull and have dents, they need to be replaced.
 
7. Clean all the parts, and then install them in reverse order from how 
you disassembled them.
 
 Be sure to apply a liberal coat of grease inside each side of the pedal. 
This will help hold the bearings in place until you thread the cone, 
washer, and locknut back on.
 
8. Finish the reassembly by refitting the dust cap.
 
 This is important to keep dirt and water out of bearings and ensure that 
your overhaul lasts.

213
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
Installing new pedals
 
Many pedals are marked with an L or an R to help you figure out which pedal 
should go on which side. You want to make sure you have the correct pedal, 
because the left pedal unscrews in a clockwise direction and the right pedal 
unscrews counterclockwise. If you try to screw in the wrong pedal, you’ll 
damage the threads.
To install new pedals, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply grease to the threads of each pedal (as shown in Figure 13-3).
 
2. Start with the right pedal, and remember that you’ll be turning the 
pedal in a clockwise direction.
 
3. To ensure that you don’t damage any threads, screw the pedal in by 
hand using care (as is shown in Figure 13-4).

Lubricating 
the pedal.
 

214
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 13-4: 
Reattaching 
the pedal.
 
 
4. When the threads engage, use the wrench to tighten the pedal.
 
 One way to tighten the pedal is to use one hand to keep the wrench 
on the pedal’s wrench flats and then, with the other hand, rotate the 
opposite crank arm to tighten.
 
 Tighten until the pedals are secure, but don’t overtighten. Carefully 
check the crank arm for any metal shavings at the base of the pedal and, 
if necessary, remove them with a file.
 
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for the left pedal, except screwing it in a 
counterclockwise direction to tighten.
Crank It Up! Working on the Crankset 
and Bottom Bracket
The two major components of the drivetrain are the crankset and the 
bottom bracket (see Figure 13-5). In this section, we explain how to service 
different types of crank arms and the two major types of bottom brackets — 
cartridges and adjustable bottom brackets.

215
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
Figure 13-5:
The crank-
set and 
bottom 
bracket.
 
The crankset
The crankset plays the leading role in moving you forward when you bike. 
Consisting of the cranks, the chainrings, and the bottom bracket assembly, 
the crankset’s job is to transfer power with the chain from your legs and the 
pedals to the chain and back to the rear wheel.
On the crankset, the crank and chainrings play important roles. The cranks 
are what connect the pedals to the bike, and the chainrings guide the chain 
as it receives the force from the turning cranks.
Of the different cranksets on the market, there are three main categories:
 
✓ One-piece: Children’s bikes and some low-end adult bikes have one-
piece cranksets, where the crank arms are one, long, S-shaped piece 
and the bottom bracket has two large bearing retainers that are service-
able and adjustable. One-piece crankset are made to be fairly durable 
to hold up to the kind of abuse a kid can dish out on bike, but as you 
might expect for a low-end product, they’re heavy and not designed for 
performance.

216
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
✓ Cottered: Older bikes tend to have cottered cranksets. These consist of 
separate crank arms that are attached to the bottom bracket axle using 
a tapered metal pin. A hammer or a special tool is used to put these pins 
in place, after which nuts are attached to keep them secure.
 
✓ Cotterless: Newer bikes are built with cotterless cranksets. These are 
higher-performance parts with crank arms that come in a variety of sizes 
and styles and are built from more expensive materials that are lighter 
and stronger. Cotterless cranks are held in place by a nut or a bolt or in 
some cases by pinch bolts on the left-side crank.
In the following sections, we tell you how to remove and install all three 
types so you can work on them.
Removing and installing a one-piece crankset
To remove a one-piece crankset, follow these steps:
 
1. Use a wrench to unscrew the lockring in a clockwise direction.
 
2. When it’s loose, remove it by lifting it over the crank arm.
 
3. Place a chisel in the slot of the slotted retainer, which sits under the 
lockring.
 
4. Tap the chisel lightly with a hammer in a clockwise direction.
 
5. When it’s loose, remove it by lifting it over the crank arm.
 
6. Pull the entire crank assembly out of the bottom bracket shell.
 
7. Use the chisel and hammer to lightly knock out the bearing cups that 
sit within the bottom-bracket shell.
To install the one piece crankset, follow these procedures in reverse.
Removing and installing a cottered crankset
On some older bikes, cranksets are attached using a cotter pin, which has to 
be removed and installed with a blow of a hammer (as shown in Figure 13-6). 
Remove the nut and washer from the pin using a wrench. Drive the pin out by 
hitting it with a standard (not rubber) hammer.
If you have trouble moving the pin, use some penetrating oil and then try 
using a punch (a chisel-like tool with a pointed end). Many times, whether 
you’re using a hammer or another tool like a punch, the pin will have to be 
replaced because the removal process will likely damage it.
To install a cotterless crankset with a socket bolt, follow these steps:
 
1. If the pin was not damaged during removal you can reuse it. 
Otherwise, take the old one to your local bike shop to buy a 
replacement.

217

pin.
 
 
2. Slide the crank arm onto the crankset and insert the pin.
 
3. Hammer the pin until it is firmly set in the crank and exposed on the 
other side.
 
4. Put the washer and bolt on the end of the pin and tighten with a 
wrench.
Removing and installing a cotterless crankset
Cotterless cranksets are held in place in one of three ways: with a socket 
bolt, by a nut and bolt, or by pinch bolts. The method for removing the 
crankset varies depending on how the crankset is held in place. We cover all 
three in the following sections.
With a socket bolt
Most bikes these days have cotterless cranksets that are attached with 
socket bolts. (These cranksets are sometimes called one-key release.) This 
type of crankset is easy to remove because it has a crank extractor built in 
(see the next section for more on extractors). There is usually not a dust cap, 
but if there is one, you can use a screwdriver to remove it.
Using an extra-long 7mm or 8mm Allen wrench, turn the bolts in a counter-
clockwise direction, holding the cranks from moving with your free hand 
(as shown in Figure 13-7).

218
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
Figure 13-7: 
Loosening 
a cotter-
less crank 
with a Allen 
wrench.
 
To install a cotterless crankset with a socket bolt, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply grease to the threads of the nut or bolt.
 
2. Insert the right crankarm into the right bottom bracket.
 
3. Insert the left crankarm onto the end of the axle of the right 
crankarm, and screw in the bolt, being careful to align the threads.
 
4. Tighten the bolt to secure the crankarm.
This type of crankset usually doesn’t have a dust cap, but if there is a dust 
cap, grease the threads and install it.
With nuts and bolts
To remove a cotterless crankset that’s held in place with nuts and bolts, you 
need a crank-arm extractor (see Figure 13-8) that fits your bike. One side of 
the crank extractor is used to remove the bolt holding the crankarm on the 
axle. The other side of the extractor allows you to remove the crankarm.
Here are the steps to take:
 
1. Use a screwdriver and remove the dust cap that covers the threads 
inside the crank arm.
 
 Be careful not to damage the dust cap.
 
2. Fit the extractor onto the nut or bolt inside the crank arm.

219
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
 
3. Using a wrench, turn the extractor in a counterclockwise direction.
 
4. When the nut or bolt is loose, use your fingers to remove the nut 
or bolt.
 
 If there is a washer with the nut or bolt, make sure to remove that 
as well.
 
5. Thread the other side of the extractor into the threads of the crank arm.
 
 Be careful to make sure that the threads are aligned and that the extrac-
tor is not being screwed in at an angle.
 
6. When it becomes too difficult to turn the extractor, use a wrench and 
continue to snugly screw the extractor into the crankarm until it 
gently pushes against the axle.
 
7. Turn the handle of the extractor to push the center core of the extrac-
tor against the axle.
 
 It will eventually push the crank off the axle.
 
The extractor is actually two tools: a 14mm or 15mm socket wrench and, 
separately, a threaded center pushing extractor tool. Sometimes these tools 
are integrated as one tool with two sides.

To install a cotterless crankset with nuts and bolts, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply grease to the threads of the nut or bolt.
 
2. Insert the right crankarm into the right bottom bracket.
 
3. Insert the left crankarm onto the end of the axle of the right crankarm 
and screw in the nut or bolt, being careful to align the threads.
 
4. Tighten the nut or bolt to secure the crank arm.
 
5. If there is a dust cap, grease the threads and install.
With pinch bolts
Some manufacturers including Shimano make cranks that are held in place 
by pinch bolts on the left crank arm. These types of cranks do not require a 
crank arm extractor for removal.
Here are the steps for removing a cotterless crank held in place with pinch 
bolts:
 
1. Loosen the pinch bolts on the left crank arm.
 
2. Remove the cap on the left crank arm.
 
 To remove the cap, you may need a special tool. In some cases, caps 
are designed to be removed with an Allen wrench.
 
3. Pull off the left crank arm.
 
4. Pull off the right crank arm.
 
 If it’s tight, give the end of its axle a light tap with a rubber hammer or 
mallet. Be careful not to mar your crank arm during this procedure.
To reinstall cotterless crankarms with pinch bolts, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the right-side crankarm with the chainrings into the bottom 
bracket, with the crank arm pointing downward at the six o’clock 
position.
 
2. Insert the left crankarm into the bottom bracket, with the crankarm 
pointing upward to the 12 o’clock position.
 
3. On the end of the axle of the right crank unit, there will be threads 
with one groove larger than the other. Align this larger groove with 
the groove on the inside of the left crank arm.
 
 This assures that both arms are exactly 180 degrees apart.
 
4. Apply grease to the ends of the cap and insert it into the center of the 
left crankarm.
 
5. Apply grease to the threads of the two pinch bolts and insert them 
into the left crank arm.

221
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
 
As you tighten, switch between the bolts every few turns to make sure they 
tighten evenly.
 
For Shimano cranks of this type, make sure to tighten the threaded dust cap 
that actually helps bind the crank. Provided with your cranks is a small tool 
used to hand-tighten this piece before you tighten the pinch bolts.
Working on chainrings
Over time, the chainrings will wear down, making shifting more difficult. If 
you have an old, stretched chain on your bike that you haven’t replaced in a 
while, this will cause the teeth on your chainrings to wear out. Likewise, worn 
teeth on chainrings will cause accelerated wear and stretching of the chain. 
Normally a chain will wear out faster than the chainrings. If you regularly 
check your chain for wear and replace it at the first signs of wear, you’ll be 
able to get two to three chain lives before you need to replace your 
chainrings.
Chainrings that need to be replaced have teeth that are thinner and look like 
waves from the ocean as opposed to cleanly cut teeth (the way they look 
when they’re first manufactured). To remove chainrings, find a clean, flat 
surface, and follow these steps:
 
1. Use an Allen wrench to remove the bolts holding the chainrings in 
place (as shown in Figure 13-9).
 
Figure 13-9: 
Removing 
chainrings.
 

222
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
2. Use a flathead screwdriver or a special slotted wrench (as shown in 
Figure 13-10) to hold the nuts in place while you use the Allen wrench.
 
3. After you remove one chainring, there may be another set of bolts 
holding the other chainring(s) in place. If so, remove these as well.
 
Be careful to hold onto any spacers when you remove the chainrings. You’ll 
need to put these back in place if you’re replacing or remounting any of the 
chainrings.
 
If you end up in an accident or run the side of your bike into something, you 
could bend the teeth on a chainring. If this causes a tooth to break or leads to 
serious damage to the overall chainring, you’ll probably want to replace it. 
However, if just one tooth or a few teeth are slightly bent, causing shifting and 
chain problems, you may be able to bend them back in place. Bike shops have 
a special chainring tooth alignment tool that is designed for this procedure. In 
some cases, you may be able to do the job with an adjustable wrench, 
although this is a little riskier.
 
Figure 13-10: 
Undoing 
chainring 
bolts.
 

223
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
To straighten chainring teeth, follow these steps:
 
1. Spin the chainring without the chain to identify which tooth or teeth 
are bent.
 
 If the bent tooth or teeth are on the large chainring, sometimes you can 
straighten it or them without removing the chainring from the bicycle. If 
not, you’ll need to remove the chainring.
 
2. If you removed the chainring, secure it in a vise as close to the bend 
and with as much of the chainring being supported or clamped in the 
vise as possible.
 
 Cover the chainring with a soft cloth so you don’t scratch or damage it 
with the vise.
 
3. Using the chainring tooth tool or an adjustable wrench, grab the tooth, 
being sure not to grab the chainring itself.
 
 If you use an adjustable wrench, tighten it onto the tooth as snugly as 
possible.
 
5. Bend the tooth slightly in the other direction to straighten it.
 
 Only try to bend or straighten one tooth at a time.
 
6. Place the chainring on a flat hard surface and examine your efforts.
Reinstall the chainring by inserting the bolts that hold it in place and revers-
ing the steps you used to remove it. If nuts are used to hold the bolts in 
place, insert these and tighten. Once you’re finished, test the chainring to 
make sure the chain shifts and runs smoothly around the chainring.
The bottom bracket
Crucial to the crankset is the bottom bracket. Of all the bearings on a bike, 
the bottom bracket is the one that has to bear the heaviest load. Not only 
does the bottom bracket have to spin while you pedal, but it takes the force 
of all the twisting and turning that occurs during pedaling.
There are two main types of bottom brackets:
 
✓ Adjustable: If you have an older or lower-end bike, you may have an 
adjustable bottom bracket. This type of bottom bracket has a cup that 
holds bearings and an axle that spins within the bottom bracket. An 
adjustable bottom bracket is much more susceptible to wear and tear 
than a cartridge-type (see the next bullet), because water and dirt can 
enter the cup where the bearings are held. Plus, an adjustable bottom 
bracket needs to be adjusted perfectly, or the bearings will prematurely 
wear out.

224
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
 If you have this style of bottom bracket you may want to think of upgrad-
ing to a cartridge bottom bracket. At the very least, you’ll want to over-
haul the bottom bracket at least once a year — more often if you do a lot 
of biking in wet or muddy conditions.
 
✓ Cartridge: Most newer bikes have a sealed-cartridge style of bottom 
bracket. A cartridge has a longer life than an ordinary bottom bracket — 
because they’re sealed, water and dirt are kept away from the bearings. 
They’re also easier to install and maintain because they don’t need to be 
adjusted the way standard bottom brackets with cups and cones do.
 
 The other advantage to cartridges is that installing them is easier and 
quicker. When they do finally wear out, you replace the entire cartridge. 
But don’t worry — you’ll ride several thousand miles before you need to 
go shopping for a new bottom-bracket cartridge.
If the bottom bracket is squeaking or if the cranks don’t rotate smoothly by 
hand with the chain off, it’s time to overhaul. If you hear any squeaking 
or grinding, if the bottom bracket is slightly loose, or if you feel a vibration 
when you pull on the cranks, you should also prepare for an overhaul.
Adjustable bottom brackets should be overhauled as part of your annual 
maintenance. Cartridge bottom brackets are replaced rather than 
overhauled — and replacement isn’t usually necessary until you’ve ridden 
a few thousand miles.
Removing and installing a cartridge bottom bracket
To remove a cartridge bottom bracket, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the cranks following the procedure described earlier for the 
type of crankset you have (one-piece, cottered, or cotterless).
 
2. Attach the appropriate bottom bracket tool to the left side of the bike 
(as shown in Figure 13-11).
 
 There are many different types of tools designed to fit many specific 
types of bottom brackets. The different tools usually have a different 
number of notches or splines, which match the number of notches or 
splines in the cup that secures the cartridge in place. Check with your 
local bike shop to determine which tool is appropriate for your bike.
 
3. Use an adjustable wrench to turn the bottom bracket tool in a counter-
clockwise direction (as shown in Figure 13-12).
 
 The one common problem in removing cartridges is that the tools slip 
while under torque, stripping the splines. Because removing the bottom 
bracket can take a tremendous amount of force, the pressure needs to 
be applied on the tool in the direction of the bike to avoid stripping the 
splines or the tool.

4. Perform the same procedure on the right side except turn the tool 
clockwise.
 
5. When the lock ring is loose, use your hand to unscrew it the rest of 
the way.
 
 It’s attached to the bottom bracket, which will come out when you’re 
finished unscrewing it (as shown in Figure 13-13).
To reinstall a cartridge bottom bracket, read the manufacturer’s instructions 
and follow these steps:
 
1. Coat the threads of the bottom bracket with grease.
 
 Some bike shops prefer to use an anti-seize agent or plumber’s thread 
tape, which hardens and expands once it dries, helping to keep the 
bottom bracket secure and protecting the threads.
 
2. Examine the cartridge for an R and an L, signifying the right and 
left side.
 
3. Insert the L side into the right side through to the left side of the 
bottom bracket shell of the frame and carefully align the threads of 
the cartridge with the threads of the frame. Screw in the cartridge 
in a counterclockwise direction.
 
Figure 13-13: 
Removing 
the 
cartridge
 

227
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
 
4. When it becomes more difficult to turn the cartridge, attach the 
bottom bracket tool.
 
5. Using an adjustable wrench, fully tighten the cartridge.
 
 Most manufacturers recommend a significant amount of torque for the 
bottom bracket, which means you need to apply a lot of force to tighten 
the bottom bracket.
 
6. Attach the cup to the other side and, using a wrench, tighten it in a 
clockwise direction.
Removing and installing an adjustable bottom bracket
To remove an adjustable bottom bracket, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the cranks following the procedure described earlier for the 
type of crankset you have (one-piece, cottered, or cotterless).
 
2. On the left side of the bike, you’ll see a lock ring with grooves cut into 
it. Unloosen the lock ring in a counterclockwise direction by using a 
specialized tool called a C-wrench (shown in Figure 13-14) or lock-ring 
wrench.
 
 If you don’t have a C-wrench, use a chisel or — as a last resort — a 
flathead screwdriver to tap against the grooves or the lock ring to break 
it free. Be careful, because this may damage your screwdriver!
 
Figure 13-14: 
Using a 
C-wrench.
 

228
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
3. After removing the lock ring, you’ll see an adjustable cup that holds 
the bearings. Remove this cap.
 
 Some adjustable cups have pin holes which require a special tool. Figure 
13-15 is an example of using a pin spanner to remove the adjustable cup. 
Unscrew the adjustable cup being careful to catch any loose bearings 
that may exist. The axle will slide out at this point.
 
4. On the right side of the bike, remove the fixed cup, which is screwed 
into the bottom bracket shell of the frame.
 
 You may not be able to remove the fixed cup, so consider taking the 
bike to your local bike shop where they’ll have a fixed-cup removal tool.
 
 You’ll need a large enough crescent or adjustable wrench to fit around 
the fixed cup. This time, turn in a clockwise direction. This side may be 
very tight.
To install an adjustable bottom bracket, follow these steps:
 
1. Clean all the parts with degreaser.
 
2. Inspect the ball bearings, cups, and axle.
 
 If they look dull or the bearing surfaces are not smooth, replace them.
 
Figure 13-15: 
Using a pin 
spanner.
 

229
 Chapter 13: Putting the Pedal to the Metal: The Drivetrain
 
3. Fill both cups with a layer of grease.
 
4. Place the same number of ball bearings in that were originally 
each cup.
 
 If you aren’t sure of the number, use as many as necessary to fit securely 
with a small gap to allow each bearing “elbow room.”
 
5. Use a screwdriver or other tool to push the bearings into the grease.
 
6. Cover the bearings with another layer of grease.
 
 Figure 13-16 has an example of bearings packed in grease.
 
Figure 13-16: 
Repacking 
the bearings 
in grease.
 
 
7. On the right side, screw on the fixed cup by hand until it tightens. 
Then very firmly tighten this side with a wrench.
 
8. On the left side of the bike, insert the longer end of the axle into the 
bottom bracket shell and into the fixed cup.
 
9. Screw on the adjustable cup until tight. Try rotating the axle. If it’s 
tight, slightly loosen the cup.
 
10. Place the lock ring on the bottom bracket and tighten, checking to 
ensure that the axle rotates smoothly and not too tightly.
 
 It may take a few tries to get an adjustment that is not too tight and not 
too loose.

230
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
Shopping for a new crankset and bottom bracket
If you have an older bike and you’d like to 
upgrade the crankset and bottom bracket, there 
are a few things to think about:
 ✓ Buy a cartridge bottom bracket. This is the 
most popular style of bottom bracket on the 
market and shouldn’t be a problem unless 
your bike requires a special bottom bracket. 
When the cartridge bottom bracket is in 
place, you’ll be able to relax knowing that 
most likely you won’t have to touch it for a 
number of years.
 ✓ If you’re moving from a cottered crankset to 
a cotterless one, you’ll to need replace both 
the cranks and the bottom bracket. You 
can’t mix a cottered crank with a cotterless 
bottom bracket.
 ✓ Make sure that the axle style and the 
threads match. There are different types of 
bottom bracket threading. The threads need 
to match your frame and the axle style 
needs to match the crankset.
 
 Consult with your local bike shop to confirm 
which bottom brackets will fit the threads 
on your bike.
 ✓ Make sure you have the right size bottom 
bracket. There are many different widths 
for bottom brackets. You need to know 
the width of the bottom bracket shell on the 
frame and the overall length needed for the 
specific crankset you’re using. Sometimes 
mountain bikes have wider bottom brackets 
than road bikes. In addition, cranks with 
three chainrings need wider bottom brack-
ets than two-chainring cranks.
 
 Again, talk with the folks at your local bike 
shop to make sure you’re getting the right 
size for your bike.
 ✓ Pay attention to crank-arm length. Crank 
arms change the circumference in which 
the pedals rotate, so with larger crank arms 
you’ll be pedaling in a wider circumference 
and getting more leverage as you pedal. 
Having longer cranks and more power is 
beneficial if you’re doing a lot of climbing. 
The downside of a larger crank is that, 
because of the wider circumference, it 
takes more effort to spin quickly — so if 
speed is a consideration, a smaller crank 
may be in order.
 
 The most common crank-arm lengths are 
172.5mm or 175mm. If you’re a short person, 
you’ll want to try using a shorter crank. At 
the same time, if you’re tall, a longer crank 
will work with your leg muscles better. A 
few manufacturers sell cranks of 185mm or 
more. The best advice is to work with your 
local bike store to find the crank the best 
suits you.
 
 With longer crank arms, it’s important to 
make sure the bottom bracket has enough 
clearance or else the crank arms could 
hit the ground when you’ re cornering or 
climbing over logs.

The Shifting System
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how derailleurs work

▶ Changing derailleur cables
▶ Removing and installing the shifters
T
his chapter covers inspection, removal, installation, and adjustment of 
the shifting system, including the cable system, shifters, and derailleurs. 
Whew!
Demystifying Derailleurs
Derailleurs are the mechanisms for “de-railing” or moving the chain from cog 
to cog and chainring to chain ring, allowing you to shift and change gears 
when you ride. The derailleurs don’t so much move the chain as they guide it 
from one side to the other, which is only possible if you’re pedaling forward 
and the chain is moving.
Both the front and rear derailleurs work through the use of an internal 
spring, which pulls the derailleur toward the bike or pushes the derailleur 
away from the bike, while the cable attached to the bike’s shifter opposes the 
force of the spring. When the shifter pulls the cable, the cable overcomes the 
spring and moves the chain toward or away from the bike. When the shifter 
releases the cable, the derailleur moves back to its normal position.
The fact that springs and cables are pushing and pulling on the derailleurs 
would be a problem if there were nothing stopping the derailleurs from 
moving the chain too far in one direction or the other. Fortunately, derail-
leurs are designed with a pair of stop-limit screws, which limit the movement 

232
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
of the derailleurs in both directions. These screws are usually marked with 
an H and an L, for high and low. The high-limit screw controls the distance 
that the derailleur can move away from the bike (toward the higher gears), 
and the low-limit screw controls the distance the derailleur can move toward 
the bike (toward the lower gears).
Limit screws physically limit movement as they’re screwed deeper into the 
derailleur. Turning the screws clockwise drives them in deeper and restricts 
the range of movement; turning the screws counterclockwise loosens them 
and increases the range of movement. If you were to tighten both limit 
screws to their maximum depth, you would limit the derailleur to a single 
position. This is good to know if you break a derailleur or chain and need to 
set the bike up for just one gear to get home.
Both derailleurs have difficult jobs when it comes to keeping up with the 
demands of a biker who is shifting to higher and lower gears. Moving the 
chain toward the frame puts the bike in a lower gear, whereas moving the 
chain away from the bike puts the bike in a higher gear. Just as with a car, 
lower gears are useful when you’re going slow (for example, climbing a steep 
hill), whereas higher gears serve you on the descent, when you’re riding at a 
faster speed.
The front derailleur has the unenviable task of moving the chain sideways as 
it’s under force. This part of the chain transmits power to the rear wheel, 
which is why when you’re applying a lot of power and moving slowly (such 
as climbing a hill) it’s hard for the front derailleur to shift.
Rear derailleurs have the job of swinging their arm or cage back and forth 
under the freewheel, guiding the chain from one cog to the next. The rear 
derailleur cage has the familiar S shape, with two jockey wheels. The top 
jockey wheel guides the chain onto the cog and the bottom jockey wheel is 
designed to keep tension on the chain and take up slack.
The rear derailleur
Rear derailleurs (shown in Figure 14-1) have been known to give even experi-
enced bike mechanics headaches at times. They do double-duty: keeping the 
chain under tension and guiding it back and forth between the cogs as the 
rider shifts. Slight changes in tension of the cable to which the derailleur is 
attached can cause shifting to become out of whack. Just as with the front 
derailleur, you can improve its functioning and longevity if you keep it clean, 
lubricated, and adjusted as needed.
The following sections describe how to remove and reinstall the derailleur.

233
 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
 
Figure 14-1: 
A rear

Removing the rear derailleur
To remove your rear derailleur, follow these instructions:
 
1. Shift the rear derailleur to the smallest cog.
 
2. Using an Allen wrench or box wrench, loosen the bolt that’s holding 
the cable in place.
 
 Note that if you don’t shift the rear derailleur to the smallest cog, it 
could spring back at you because it’s under tension from the cable.
 
3. Use an Allen wrench or box wrench (as shown in Figure 14-2) to 
remove the bolt that is holding bottom jockey wheel in place.
 
 Spray some lubricant on the jockey wheel if the bolt will not budge.
 
4. After the bolt is removed, lift out the jockey wheel.
 
5. Use an Allen wrench or box wrench (as shown in Figure 14-3) and 
reach around the derailleur to loosen the bolt that holds the top 
jockey wheel in place.

6. After the bolt is loose, you should be able to separate the cage (as 
shown in Figure 14-4).
 
7. With the cage separated, lift the chain off the top jockey wheel and 
away from the derailleur.
 
 Rest the chain on one of the cogs, letting the slack hang down.
 
8. Use an Allen wrench to remove the pivot bolt (see Figure 14-5), which 
will allow you to remove the derailleur.

Installing the rear derailleur
To install the rear derailleur, follow the steps in this section.
 
1. Position the derailleur so that the chain wraps around the right half of 
the top jockey wheel (as you’re facing the right side of the bike).
 
2. Align the mounting bolt with the gear hanger on the frame.
 
3. Insert the mounting bolt and tighten with an Allen wrench.
 
4. Pull the chain through the cage and, while holding the cage and chain 
with one hand, insert the bottom jockey wheel so that the chain wraps 
around the left side of the wheel.
 
5. Close the cage so that the holes align with the hole in the bottom 
jockey.
 
6. Insert the bolt and tighten both jockey wheel mounting bolts securely.
 
7. Adjust the H limit screw (see Figure 14-6) and the L limit screw (see 
Figure 14-7) so that they limit the derailleur from throwing the chain 
off the bike or, even worse, into your spokes.
 
 Tighten both screws in a clockwise direction two turns. This will restrict 
the movement further than it was before.
 
Figure 14-6: 
Adjusting 
the H screw.
 

237
 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
 
Figure 14-7: 
Adjusting 
the L screw.
 
 
8. To stimulate shifting with the cable, practice turning the pedals with 
your right hand while pushing inward and upward on the derailleur 
with your left thumb. Wrap your index finger around the cage and 
push on the cage with your thumb.
 
 Note: These steps are for the most common type of rear derailleur. If 
you have a rapid-rise rear derailleur, the spring is opposite and pulls 
the derailleur toward the low gear. Therefore, you’ll need to reverse the 
process when moving the derailleur with your hand.
 
9. Using the method in Step 8, try to shift the chain to the largest cog. 
(It won’t succeed on the first attempt because you tightened the L limit 
screw as a safety precaution.) Loosen the L limit screw by a slight 
amount, about one-quarter to one-half a revolution, and then begin 
turning the pedals again.
 
 Do this in incremental steps until you’re able to shift the chain onto the 
largest cog. The chain should spin smoothly on the largest cog and not 
make any grinding sounds.
 
10. Perform Step 9 in the opposite direction making incremental adjust-
ments to the H limit screw until the chain arrives on the smallest cog.
 
 You won’t need to move the derailleur with your hand because the 
spring in the derailleur will pull it down and outward. Now you’re ready 
to attach the cable and make finer adjustments to the shifting.

238
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
11. Run the cable through the cable-adjusting barrel hole and through the 
cable anchor bolt clamp.
 
 There should be a notch in the cable anchor bolt clamp where the cable 
is designed to sit when the clamp is tightened.
 
12. Tighten the clamp with an Allen wrench or box wrench (as shown in 
Figure 14-8).
 
13. To make the cable taut, use a pair of pliers or a fourth-hand tool, and 
pull the cable as you tighten the cable clamp bolt.
 
14. Test the shifting of the derailleur down onto the highest gear.
 
 Sometimes when you’re tightening the cable, you can pull the derailleur 
over just a little and then it’ll not drop down onto the highest gear.
 
15. Attach a cable cap (see Figure 14-9) to the end of the cable and use a 
pair of pliers to crimp it into place.
 
 This will prevent the cable from fraying.
 
 Always leave about 2 inches of cable on the outside or past the cable 
anchor bolt. This will make future adjustment to the cable and/or 
derailleur much easier.

Attaching 
the cable.

Figure 14-9:

Many rear derailleurs have a third screw called a B-angle screw. This is used 
to adjust the space between the upper jockey wheel and the cogs. Normally, 
you won’t need to adjust this unless you’re installing a new derailleur. If you 
do install a new one, adjust this screw until the upper jockey wheel is close 
but still has enough space to allow the chain to pass freely without making 
contact with the cogs.
Adjusting the rear derailleur
If you find that your chain is jumping back and forth between gears or getting 
stuck on a cog and needs an extra click or two to shift, you need to make an 
adjustment to your rear derailleur.
The easiest way to recognize that your derailleur needs adjustment is a 
rattling or clanking noise from the chain when you’re pedaling.
Here’s how to adjust the rear derailleur:
 
1. Use a bike stand or other mechanism to support the bike with the 
back wheel off the ground.
 
 You’ll need to pedal the bike with one hand and shift with the other, so 
having the bike up off the ground is essential

240
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
2. Start by examining how well the derailleur shifts to lower gears or to 
the larger cogs: Shift the derailleur until it moves the chain onto the 
largest cog.
 
 If it struggles to reach the largest cog, loosen the L-limit screw (refer to 
Figure 14-7) by a quarter- or half-turn until the chain easily reaches 
the largest cog. If the chain goes over the cog, tighten the L-limit screw 
to restrict the movement of the derailleur.
 
3. Shift the derailleur in the opposite direction to the higher gears, 
focusing on how well the chain shifts onto the smallest cog.
 
 If it hesitates to drop down, loosen the H-limit screw (refer to Figure 
14-8) by a quarter- or half-turn until the chain sits easily on the smallest 
cog. If the chain is thrown off the freewheel to the outside, tighten the 
H-limit screw.
 
4. After the limits for the derailleur have been set, shift through all the 
gears, making sure that the chain moves to another cog with each 
click of the shift lever.
 
 If the chain hesitates or makes a lot of noise, you’ll need to use the 
barrel adjuster to do some fine-tuning (see Figure 14-10): Start with the 
chain on the smallest cog and, while pedaling, shift one click. The 
derailleur should move the chain instantly to the next cog. If it doesn’t, 
turn the barrel adjuster about a quarter of a turn counterclockwise. If 
the opposite problem is true and the chain shifted two places, turn the 
barrel clockwise. Repeat this procedure for each of the cogs on the free-
wheel until the chain is shifting smoothly for each click of the shifter.

 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
If the derailleur is shifting well going up to the larger cogs and slow or 
hesitating coming down to the smaller cogs there may be a kink or problem 
with the cable not moving smoothly through the housing. Remove the 
cable, inspect it, and replace it if it is kinked, frayed, or damaged.
The rear derailleur is a very exposed part of the bike and is prone to being 
bent or damaged if the bike falls over on top of it. If this happens, all you may 
need to do is bend the derailleur back into shape. Here’s how:
 
1. Use one hand to insert an Allen wrench into the mounting bolt.
 
2. With the other hand wrapped around the body of the derailleur, 
leverage the derailleur back into place so it’s suspended in a straight 
line under one of the cogs.
If you have problems aligning your derailleur, make a visit to your local bike 
shop. Most shops have a specialty tool called a derailleur hanger alignment 
tool, which is made to perform this task and measure the positioning.
Cleaning the rear derailleur
Because the rear derailleur is so close to the ground and so exposed, it 
accumulates a lot of dirt and grit over time. If you do a lot of riding, especially 
any off-road riding, you may want to think about adding a rear derailleur 
cleaning to your monthly maintenance activities (see Chapter 17).
You can clean the rear derailleur on the bike by using a solvent and a brush 
to scrub it down. But for a more thorough cleaning, consider removing it and 
then soaking it in a strong degreaser solvent. After it’s soaked for bit, use a 
brush to remove any dirt and grit trapped in its inside parts. Use a rag and 
clean the jockey wheels — dirt and grime will normally be caked onto their 
surfaces. Rinse with warm water and then blow-dry with compressed air. 
Let the derailleur dry completely before reinstalling, and then lubricate the 
pivots in the derailleur and the inside and outside center of the jockey 
wheels.
A cassette cleaning brush is very useful for regularly clearing dirt and muck 
from the jockey wheels.
Most jockey wheels are made of plastic, so regularly inspect them for wear. 
When the teeth start to get pointed and sharp and they’re no longer nice, 
squared-off tops, replace them.
The front derailleur
Your front derailleur probably won’t give you as many headaches as the rear 
derailleur will over the life of your bike, but it will need occasional care and 
service. If you have a front derailleur that’s acting up, it probably needs a 

242
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
new cable or just a thorough cleaning and lubrication, which will be more 
effective if you perform it while the derailleur is off the bike. The following 
sections describe how to remove and then reinstall the front derailleur, as 
well as how to adjust it.
Removing a front derailleur
To remove a front derailleur, follow these steps:
 
1. Shift the derailleur to the smallest chain ring to remove tension on the 
cable.
 
2. Using an Allen wrench or a box wrench, detach the cable by loosen-
ing the anchor bolt that holds it in place (see Figure 14-11).
 
3. Use an Allen wrench or box wrench and undo the pivot bolt that holds 
the derailleur to the seat tube (see Figure 14-12).
 
4. To remove the chain from the derailleur cage, remove the nut and 
bolt holding the cage together, and pull apart the cage so that the 
chain will slide through (see Figure 14-13).
 
 Some front derailleurs have a rivet holding the cage together, which 
requires you to first remove the chain from the bicycle and then 
proceed.
 
Figure 14-11: 
Removing 
the cable.

5. Spread apart the derailleur mounting clamp and remove the 
derailleur from the seat tube.
Installing a front derailleur
Follow these steps to install a front derailleur:
 
1. Open the cage of the front derailleur and wrap it around the chain.
 
2. Replace the nut and bolt that holds together the cage.
 
3. Wrap the derailleur mounting clamp around the seat post, and thread 
the clamp bolt enough so that it isn’t tight but allows the derailleur to 
be moved by hand.
 
4. Align the derailleur so that its outside cage edge runs parallel with the 
chainrings.
 
 Visually inspect the position by standing overhead and looking down on 
the derailleur.
 
5. Position the derailleur at a height that places it about 2mm above the 
teeth of the largest chainring.
 
6. After aligning and positioning, firmly tighten the mounting clamp bolt.
 
 In order to limit the movement of the derailleur so that it doesn’t throw 
the chain off the chainrings, you need to set the H- and L-limit screws.
 
7. Set the L-limit screw so that the side of the cage closest to the bike is 
about 2mm inward of the smallest chainring.
 
8. Pull the derailleur away from the bike and over the large chainring.
 
9. Set the H-limit screw so that when you move the derailleur as far as it 
will go, it reaches to a position 2mm outward of the largest chainring.
 
10. After you’ve found the correct position for the derailleur, pass the 
cable through to the anchor bolt and, while holding the cable taut 
with a pair of pliers or a fourth-hand tool, tighten the anchor bolt.
 
 Make sure you follow the correct route for the front derailleur cable. 
Some bikes are designed with the cable coming up from the bottom 
bracket, and others drop down the length of the seat tube.
 
11. For a new cable, shift the levers a few times to stretch and seat the 
cable. Then loosen the cable anchor bolt, pull the cable taut, and 
retighten if necessary.
 
12. If you have installed a new cable, cut off any extra and then attach a 
cable cap to the end. Crimp the end cap in place with pliers.
 
 Always leave about 2 inches of cable on the outside or past the cable 
anchor bolt. This will make future adjustment to the cable and/or 
derailleur much easier.

245
 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
Adjusting the front derailleur
One of the first things you need to do to adjust the front derailleur is to set 
limit screws so that the derailleur doesn’t move too far and push or pull the 
chain off the chain rings. There is nothing worse than hitting a steep hill, 
shifting to your smallest chainring, and having the chain fly off the chainring 
and become stuck in between the chainring and chainstay. A properly 
adjusted limit screw will ensure that the chain doesn’t go past the smallest 
chainring when shifting.
 
1. Shift the derailleur to move the chain onto the smallest chainring.
 
2. Set the L-limit screw so that the side of the cage closest to the bike is 
about 2mm outside the smallest chainring (see Figure 14-14).
 
3. Shift the derailleur to the largest chainring.
 
4. Set the H-limit screw so that the cage plate farthest from the bike is 
about 2mm outside the largest chainring.
 
5. Try shifting between the two or three chainrings on your bike.
 
 If the chain doesn’t not move easily to the appropriate chainring or it 
rubs on the side of the derailleur cage, you may need to make some 
fine-tuning adjustments (see the following steps).
 
Figure 14-14: 
Adjusting 
the L-limit 
screw.
 

246
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
6. To fine-tune the front derailleur, try increasing the tension using the 
cable adjuster.
 
 On front derailleurs, this is usually located where the cable enters the 
left shift lever. Make quarter- to half-turns of the adjuster and recheck.
 
 You can also make small adjustments to the H- and L-limit screws to 
improve shifting or prevent the chain from rubbing on the cage.
The derailleur cable
If the cable is frayed, kinked, or worn, it probably needs replacing. When you 
go to buy a new cable, make sure you buy cable and housing (the rubber 
coated sheath) that is made specifically for derailleurs — it’s normally a little 
thinner than brake cable, which has to be able to handle greater force.
You’ll be able to tell that it’s derailleur housing because the inner core wires 
run linearly with the length of the housing, which makes for a much more 
rigid housing and doesn’t allow any compression, resulting in a more precise 
shift. Brake cable housing has the inner core wires wound around like a 
coil, which allows more flexibility in the housing and a more controlled 
brake-lever feel.
Before you remove the shifter cable, take a moment to observe how it’s 
routed around the frame of the bike. Pay attention to the location of the cable 
housing, where the cable housing meets the cable stops, and the how 
the cable exits on the other side. You’ll need to route the cable and cable 
housing in the same manner when you reinstall it. You want the housing to 
be as short as possible. The housing should have gradual curves without 
any binding or sharp angles.
Follow these steps for removing the derailleur cable:
 
1. Shift the chain onto the small cog for the rear of the bike or the small 
chainring for the front.
 
 This will put the index ratcheting system in the relaxed position and 
allow you to remove the cable.
 
 Very few bicycles have reverse springs in either the front or rear 
derailleur; if yours does, you’ll need to shift into the large cog or the 
large chainring to put the derailleur in the relaxed position.
 
2. Unfasten the derailleur cable by loosening the cable anchor bolt 
where the cable attaches to the rear or front derailleur.
 
3. To remove the cable, you need to push it through the other side of the 
shifter.
 
 To do this, look for where the cable enters the shift lever and pull back 
on the cable housing to expose the cable

247
 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
 
4. For STI shifters, squeeze the brake lever and press the shifter inward 
at the same time.
 
 This will open up the center core of the shifter where the barrel at the 
end of the cable is seated. You should be able to see the barrel.
 
5. Push the cable into the shifter so that the barrel is forced through and 
out the other side.
 
 Handlebar shifters have different ways of concealing the barrel end of 
the cable. On some, there may be a screw-in plug or rubber cap that 
hides the cables. On the popular Shimano STI–style shifter, where the 
shift lever is integrated into the brake level, the cable runs sideways 
through the shifter. When the chain is on the smallest gear and you pull 
back on the brake lever and shift lever at the same time, you can see the 
barrel on the end of the cable.
 
 Use pliers to grab the barrel and pull the cable the rest of the way out of 
the lever.
 
6. Collect any ferrules that were holding the cable housing in place at 
the anchor points or cable stops.
 
 You’ll use them when you reinstall the cable.
It’s a good practice to change the cable housing when you replace cable 
wires. Manufacturers often sell cable with the housing included in the 
package. They normally give you more housing than you need, so you’ll have 
to cut it to fit your bike.
Follow these steps to install the derailleur cable:
 
1. To install new cable and housing, you first need to prepare the cable 
housing.
 
 Assuming that the old housing was the proper length, use the older 
pieces of cable housing as guides for cutting the new pieces. Use a cable 
cutter for this procedure — they cut the housing without compressing 
the end too much.
 
 Even if you use cable cutter, you may need to file the end if it has any 
sharp edges. You may also need to open up the end of the housing 
with an awl or another pointed instrument if the end is closed up after 
cutting.
 
2. When you’re ready to install the new cable, use a rag to apply a light 
coating of grease to its surface.
 
3. For STI-style shifters, squeeze the brake lever, push the shifter to the 
inside to expose the hole for the cable, and insert the cable.
 
 You may have to wiggle it around to pass it through the shifter.

248
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
4. Pull the cable out the other side of the shifter.
 
 Some trigger shifters and most grip shifters will require you to open the 
shifter body to load the cable. This may be challenging, especially on 
grip shifters.
 
5. Attach the ferrules that came with the cable housing to the ends of 
each piece of housing where needed.
 
6. Insert the cable into the proper cable housing and pull it out the 
other end.
 
7. Route the cable and cable housing around the frame of the bike in the 
same position as it was before.
 
 The ferrules at the ends of the cable housing should fit snugly into the 
cable stops on the frame.
 
8. Run the cable through the cable anchor bolt on whichever derailleur 
is correct for that cable and tighten the cable anchor bolt.
 
 If you’re installing cables for the first time, they’re likely to stretch a 
little after you’ve used them. It’s a good idea to shift them though the 
full range of gears a few times after connecting them. Then pull the cable 
taut and reconnect the cable anchor bolt if necessary.
Gear Shifters
There are a variety of different shifters available today but they all do pretty 
much the same thing: pulling a cable to move a derailleur in one direction 
and then releasing the cable to allow the derailleur spring to move it in the 
other direction.
Most bikes these days use index shifters that are mounted on the handlebars. 
Index shifters make a click each time a gear change is made, which prevents 
riders from missing a shift. They’re much easier to use than the traditional 
friction-type shifters, seen mostly on older bikes. Friction shifters are usually 
mounted on the down tube as two levers that the rider moves up or down to 
move the derailleurs. For someone not used to friction shifters, it can be a 
little unnerving to take your hand off the handlebars to make a shift.
Most shifters today, such as the one shown in Figure 14-15, do not require 
much maintenance and are not designed to be dissembled. In some cases, 
worn levers can be replaced, but if the internal mechanism of the shifter 
starts to wear out and the clicks become less distinct, it’s probably time to 
replace the levers.
The one thing you can do with shifters is give an occasional spray of a light 
lubrication into their internal parts. Operate the shifter a few times after the 
application, and wipe off any excess grease.

249
 Chapter 14: Dropping It into Gear: The Shifting System
To adjust the position, loosen the clamp bolt if there is one, and move the 
shifters to a more comfortable position (as shown in Figure 14-16). If the 
shifters are on a road bike and are wrapped with tape, instead of removing 
the tape, you can loosen the clamp holding the handlebars and rotate the 
handlebars forward or backward slightly.

Removing shifters
In this section, we tell you how to remove shifters on road bikes, with a focus 
on STI-style shifters, where the shifter is integrated into the brake lever. To 
remove the shifters follow these steps:
 
1. Unscrew or remove the handlebar end plugs and then remove the 
handlebar tape.
 
2. Locate the bolt that holds the shifter onto the handlebars.
 
 The position varies on different types of shifters although in many cases 
you need to roll back the rubber hood to find it.
 
3. After pulling back the rubber hood and finding the bolt, use an Allen 
wrench to loosen the bolt without removing it.
 
 This will loosen the bracket and allow you to slide the shifter off the 
handlebars.
 
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for the other shifter.
 
5. The final step in removing the shifters is to remove the brake (see 
Chapter 8) and shift lever cables (see “The derailleur cable,” earlier in 
this chapter).
Installing shifters
To install shifters, follow these steps:
 
1. Slide the bracket that holds the shifter onto the end of the handlebar 
and move the shifter toward the top of the handlebar.
 
2. Place a ruler against the bottom of the shifter lever and align it with 
the curved part of the handlebars.
 
 This is a good starting point. From here, you can raise them slightly 
higher for a more casual and comfortable riding position.
 
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other shifter.
 
4. To make sure the shifters are level, set the ruler across the top of both 
and adjust their position as needed.
 
5. When you’ve found the proper position for the shifters, tighten the 
mounting bolts.
 
6. With the shifters in place, thread both the derailleur and brake cables 
through the shifters and continue the cable installation according to 
the instructions in this chapter for derailleur cables and Chapter 8 for 
brake cables.
 
7. Tape the handlebars according to the instructions in Chapter 15.

The Steering System
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the different types of handlebars
▶ Taping your handlebars
▶ Inspecting your headset
▶ Adjusting and overhauling your headset
I
n this chapter, we take a look at your bike’s steering system and this 
system’s most important component, the headset. The steering system 
includes the handlebars, which are held in place by a stem. The stem con-
nects to the top of the fork, which sits inside the head tube. On the inside of 
the top and bottom of the head tube are the bearings. When these parts are 
in good working order, they provide you with a steering experience that is 
smooth and effortless.
At the center of the steering system is the headset, the group of parts 
(including the bearings) that are connected to the head tube and allow the 
handlebars, stem, and fork to turn. Although you may think that the head-
set plays a small role in the biking experience, it has to work hard to give 
you smooth, responsive turning, especially because the bearings it contains 
can take a serious beating when you ride. The constant bumps, jarring, and 
impacts are absorbed by the front wheel and transferred up the fork and 
into the bearings — and that’s what causes them to wear out over time. 
When your bearings start to wear out, what at one point felt like automatic 
steering on a luxury vehicle will start acting like rack-and-pinion steering on 
an old beater. So do yourself a favor and inspect your headset on a regular 
basis and overhaul it as a part of your annual maintenance — we tell you 
how in this chapter.
We also give you information on handlebars including the different types 
available for most bikes. Finally, we give you information on wrapping your 
handlebars with new tape, which can not only add a touch of color and a 
fresh look to your bike, but increase your comfort — for little cost and effort.

Gimme a Hand: Types of Handlebars
Without the handlebars, you wouldn’t be able to steer your bike. The handle-
bars are one of the three points where your body comes in contact with the 
bike, so you need to find handlebars that fit you well. The best fit handlebars 
can give you a great ride and even make up for a frame that doesn’t fit you 
perfectly. Poorly chosen handlebars can force you into an awkward position 
when you ride, making you uncomfortable, giving you numb hands and a stiff 
back, or worse.
 
If you’re shopping for handlebars, we recommend that you find ones that are 
designed to fit the type of bike you have, match the style of riding you plan on 
doing, and work well with the proportions of your body.
Here are the three main types of handlebars (see Figure 15-1):
 
Figure 15-1: 
The three 
types of 
handlebars: 
drop bars, 
flat bars, 
and riser 
bars.
 
 
✓ Drop bars: Drop bars are popular on road bikes. Because of their design, 
they offer more hand positions, which is a luxury on long rides. They 
also provide a more aerodynamic position when you put your hands on 
the drops, or the curved part of the bars, which is helpful if you’re facing 
a headwind and want to get as low as possible.

253
 Chapter 15: Turning on a Dime: The Steering System
 
 One drawback of drop bars is that, if you rest your hands close together 
on the tops (the flat part on either side of the clamp), your hands won’t 
be close to the brakes if you need to brake suddenly — although they do 
make a second set of brake levers that are accessible for your hands on 
the flat part of the bars.
 
 There are many different styles, shapes, and sizes of drop bars. Some 
have a flattened area in the curve of the drop section for greater support 
of your hands. Others have an expanded flat platform section on the 
upper flat part for more surface contact area for your palms.
 
✓ Flat bars: Flat bars are popular on mountain and hybrid bikes. Their 
design provides more control and leverage in low-speed maneuvering, 
which is helpful if you’re maneuvering around obstacles on an off-road 
trail. Flat bars are nice for the recreational rider, because you’re sitting 
more upright and able to look around and enjoy the scenery.
 
 The downside of flat bars is that they offer fewer positions in which to 
rest your hands. However, this isn’t usually a problem, because most 
riders are seated in a more upright position with less pressure on the 
arms and hands in the first place.
 
 If you feel numbness in your hands, which can happen with any type of 
handlebar, check to make sure that you aren’t leaning too far over the 
handlebars. If you are, you may need to adjust your saddle forward, 
install a shorter stem, or consider buying a riser bar (on which both 
ends of the handlebar rise up slightly). Another option is to buy cycling 
gloves, which help reduce the impact and vibration of the ride.
 
✓ Riser bars: On mountain bikes you sometimes need lift (the ability to 
raise your front wheel over obstacles). For road bikes, this isn’t an 
issue because your center of gravity is normally low and you’re riding 
on flat surfaces.
 
 Handlebars designed with a rise improve the lift of a bike. Rise is the 
amount that the ends of the bars are higher than the clamp. With greater 
rise, the rider can move her weight back over the rear tire and increase 
lift, which is important for downhill biking competitions. This also 
allows the bars to be rolled or moved closer or farther away from you 
for your comfort and control.
Delving Deeper: Handlebar Options
There are a number of options when it comes to handlebars, and which ones 
you need to pay attention to depend on the kind of riding you’ll be doing and 
what style matches the physical proportions of your body. Here are the main 
options to consider:

254
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
✓ Width: One measure for handlebars is their size from end to end. 
Narrow handlebars give you less turning power but more precise 
steering, sensitivity to slight movements. Wider handlebars give you 
leverage; they may not be as responsive to steering, but they give you 
a more stable, controlled ride, especially on rough terrain.
 
 You normally want handlebars that are as wide as your shoulder bones. 
Handlebars that are narrower than your shoulders will constrict your 
breathing, because your arms are holding your chest inward. If your 
arms spread out too much wider than your shoulders, you actually 
begin to lose leverage.
 
✓ Material: Most handlebars are made of either steel, chromoly (a steel 
alloy), aluminum, or carbon fiber. Aluminum and carbon are lighter 
and more comfortable than steel and chromoly. You’ll save weight with 
carbon, but you’ll end up paying more for it.
 
 On flat bars made of steel, aluminum, or chromoly, you can shorten the 
width by cutting the ends.
 
✓ Sweep: Handlebars may also have a certain amount of sweep (the angle 
that the handlebars bend either forward or backward from the stem 
clamp). The benefit of greater sweep is that it allows your wrists to be 
in a more natural and comfortable bent position. It also brings the bars 
back closer to you for easier control.
 
✓ Taper: Some handlebars are narrower toward the ends. This saves 
weight and keeps the handlebars strong where they need to be.
 
✓ Flare: On flared handlebars, the handlebar ends flare out rather than 
dropping straight down. They’re used in off-road racing.
 
✓ Butting: Butting takes material out of the center section of the tube, 
while leaving the ends of the tube thicker where it’s needed for joint 
strength. Butting is used to increase the strength of the handlebars with-
out adding weight. Butting is most often found toward the center of the 
handlebars. This design is used on specialized handlebars particularly 
risers used for downhill mountain-bike racing.
 
✓ Bar ends: Bar ends are extensions added to the end of flat handlebars. 
They give you an increased number of positions for your hands and pro-
vide leverage when you’re climbing, by helping you move your weight 
back and lower your center of gravity.
 
If you’re shopping for new handlebars, make sure you check the clamp size for 
your stem. The most popular clamp size with road and mountain bikes is 
25.4mm. In recent years, an oversize 31.8mm clamp size has been becoming 
popular on some mountain and road bikes. If you’re unsure of what size you 
have on your bike, check the owner’s manual or visit your local bike shop.

Taping Your Handlebars
Nothing makes a bike look more worn than ragged and tattered tape on the 
handlebars. Replacing old tape is a relatively simple and cheap procedure, 
and it’s a great way to add a little color and a fresh look to your bike while 
improving your comfort and grip.
To begin, you’ll need to remove the plugs from the end of the handlebars 
using a screwdriver to unscrew them or pry them off. If your brake levers 
have rubber or gum hoods, roll the back away from the handlebars — you 
don’t need to remove these hoods. Also, peel off the old tape, cleaning any 
sticky residue from the bars.
Here are some tips you should keep in mind when wrapping your handlebars 
with tape:
 
✓ Some tape comes with gel patches for added comfort. If you’re using 
this kind of tape, place it on the handlebars in the positions described in 
the packaging instructions.
 
✓ The tape will stay in place longer if you start at the bottom and work 
your way to the center of the bars.
 
✓ When you start wrapping, leave about an inch of tape off the end of 
the handlebars. You’ll tuck these ends in with the plugs when you’re fin-
ished and they’ll help keep the bar end plugs in place.
 
✓ Most tapes come with two small pieces that are used to cover the back 
of the clamps which hold the brakes in place. You don’t have to use 
these, but it gives you a much cleaner and finished look.
 
✓ Overlap the tape by about a quarter to a half of the previous wrap. 
Pull it tightly but not so tightly that it’ll break.
 
✓ When you reach the center of the handlebars, you should be out of 
tape. If you have additional length, you can continue wrapping in the 
opposite direction or cut off the excess.
 
✓ When you’re finished, use electrical tape to secure the edge of the wrap-
ping to the center of the handlebars. Wrap the electrical tape around the 
bars three to four times, pulling snuggly until the last time around. Cut the 
electrical tape with scissors and then secure the electrical tape without 
stretching it. If you pull and stretch the electrical tape, because of the 
elasticity of the tape, it’ll pull back halfway through your first ride.

256
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
To tape your handlebars, follow these steps:
 
1. Begin by wrapping the tape from the end of the handlebar, overlap-
ping at least a quarter of the tape with each wrap (see Figure 15-2).
 
2. Continue wrapping the tape until you come to the bottom of the shifters.
 
 When you purchase handlebar tape, it should come with a small piece 
that covers the part of the handlebar where the shifter is connected. 
Make sure you attach this piece (as shown in Figure 15-3).
 
Figure 15-2: 
Start at the 
end of the 
handlebar.
 
 
3. Pull the tape up and under the handlebar in preparation to pull the 
tape back down and around the shifters (see Figure 15-4).
 
4. Pull the tape upward so that there is no slack (see Figure 15-5).
 
5. Pull the tape downward and away from the shifters (see Figure 15-6).
 
6. Pull the tape downward, around the handlebar, and toward the shifters 
(see Figure 15-7).
 
7. Wrap the tape around the handlebar, away from the shifters and over-

Getting Your Head around 
This: The Headset
The headset is the part of the bike that connects the stem and the fork to the 
frame and provides the mechanism that allows you to steer the bike.
There are two major styles of headsets:
 
✓ Threaded: The threaded headset screws onto the threads at the top 
of the column attached to the fork steering tube. This is the traditional 
type of headset found on a majority of older bikes.
 
✓ Threadless: The threadless headset is not threaded onto the column on 
top of the fork. Instead, it’s held together by the compression of an internal 
bolt that runs through the top cap into a wedge in the fork steering tube. 
Depending on the style, it’s either pressed into the head tube or sits on top 
of the fork steering tube and is held in place by a top cap. The threadless 
headset is found on almost all midrange to high-end bikes these days.
Inspecting the headset
Headsets are designed to last a long time, but even the best headsets can wear 
out, especially if they aren’t cared for. One way to check whether your headset 
has issues is to test it for looseness. Here are three checks you can try:
 
✓ Straddle the frame of your bike with your hands firmly clenching the 
brakes. Try rocking the bike back and forth.
 
✓ Stand astride the front wheel facing your bike with the wheel pinched 
between your legs and your hands on the handlebars. Try wiggling the 
handlebars back and forth.
 
✓ Lift the front wheel off the ground and strike the tire with your hand, 
while listening for vibrations.
With the bike in a stand, grasp the fork and the frame and try to flex the fork 
to see if there is any play in the headset. Lift the front wheel off the ground 
and turn the handlebars back and forth. If they feel tight and don’t move 
smoothly, you may have tightened the headset too much. With the wheels off 
the ground and the back wheel higher than the front, the front wheel should 
swing like a pendulum freely back and forth.
If, with any of these procedures, you feel play in the stem, it could mean that 
you need to either adjust or replace the headset.
Here are some other signs of headset problems:

262
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
✓ The handlebars and fork rattle when you ride.
 
✓ The handlebars don’t turn smoothly.
 
✓ You have trouble riding in a straight line.
Adjusting your headset
Although headsets don’t need to be adjusted very often, over time all the 
turning you do on your bike and all the bumps and jolts the headset receives 
from the road may cause the headset to loosen. If you inspect the headset 
following the steps in the preceding section and find looseness, follow these 
steps to adjust it.
Threadless headsets
Threadless headsets usually don’t require adjustment very often, especially 
when compared to threaded headsets, but you may need to make an adjust-
ment occasionally. Here’s how:
 
1. Loosen the stem clamp bolt or the bolts holding the stem in place.
 
2. Tighten (clockwise) or loosen (counterclockwise) the bolt in the center 
of the top cap.
 
3. After you’ve made the adjustment, retighten the stem clamp bolt or bolts.
 
 Do not over-tighten the top cap. It isn’t designed to hold the fork in 
place — it’s designed only to keep a slight load on the bearings for the 
adjustment procedure until the stem clamp bolts are tightened, holding 
everything in place.
 
4. Check the adjustment using the procedures from the preceding section, 
“Inspecting the headset.”
Threaded headsets
To adjust a threaded headset, you generally need two specialized headset 
wrenches that fit your bike.
 
If you have a large, adjustable wrench for the top lock nut, you can get by with 
one headset wrench for the adjusting nut or cone.
 
The headset sizes are almost always 32 or 26. Some adjustable cones use 
round surfaced edges, which you can use your hands or lock jaw pliers to 
adjust.
To adjust a threaded headset, follow these steps:

263
 Chapter 15: Turning on a Dime: The Steering System
 
1. Loosen the locknut on the top of the headset by turning it counter-
clockwise about one turn.
 
2. Below the locknut, locate the adjustable cup or cone.
 
3. If you are tightening the headset, turn the adjustable cup or cone 
clockwise in 20-degree increments. Turn it counterclockwise to 
loosen it.
 
 After each turn, secure the locknut and check the headset adjustment 
(see “Inspecting the headset,” earlier in this chapter).
 
 It may take several adjustments until you get it right. Continue until 
there is no looseness and the bearings are not being pressed against too 
tightly. If you aren’t sure, err on the side of being a little tighter.
Overhauling your headset
If adjustments don’t alleviate looseness or other issues with the headset, you 
may need to overhaul it. Headsets can take a lot of abuse, especially if you 
ride on challenging terrain or in bad weather, so an overhaul that replaces 
bearings and packs them in fresh grease can go a long way toward improving 
and extending the life of your bike’s steering system.
Threadless headsets
Overhauling a threadless headset is sometimes easier if you remove the han-
dlebars. Do this by removing the bolts in the stem that hold the handlebars 
in place. It also helps to remove the front wheel from the fork (see Chapter 
7). Depending on what type of brakes you have, you may need to remove 
these as well (see Chapter 8).
Here’s how to overhaul a threadless headset:
 
1. Using an Allen wrench, unscrew and remove the bolt and top cap in 
the top of the stem (as shown in Figure 15-11).
 
2. Loosen the clamp bolt or bolts holding the stem in place (see 
Figure 15-12).
 
 Be sure to keep a hand on the fork if your bike is off the ground.
 
3. Slide the stem off the fork steering tube (as shown in Figure 15-13).
 
 As you do this, make sure you hold onto the fork so that it doesn’t fall 
on the ground.
 
4. Remove the parts of the headset, including any washers or spacers (as 
shown in Figure 15-14).
 
 Keep track of the order in which you remove things so you can put 
everything back together more easily.

264
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
5. Pull the fork out of the frame (as shown in Figure 15-15).
 
 If the fork is stuck, you may have to tap it with a mallet, being careful not 
to damage the top of the steering tube.

Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
6. Remove the bearings (see Figure 15-16).
 
 There is a top and bottom or an inside and outside of the bearing race. 
Take note of the bearing race positioning before removing the bearings. 
If you don’t reinstall them properly, you won’t be able to adjust the 
headset and you’ll damage both the bearings and the headset.
 
7. The bearings will likely be contained in a race with their surfaces 
exposed or sealed in a cartridge (see Figure 15-17 for both types):
 
• If the bearings are exposed, inspect them. Bearings that are pitted 
or do not have a shiny surface should be replaced.
 
• If your bearings are sealed in a cartridge, check to see that they 
turn smoothly. If they don’t, replace them.
 
8. Clean and inspect all parts.
 
9. When you’re ready to reinstall the headset, coat both cups with a 
layer of grease.
 
10. Insert one of the races into the bottom cup.
 
11. While holding the bottom race into place with one hand, insert the 
fork with the other hand.
 
 This procedure is sometimes easier if you turn the bike over.
 
12. When the fork is inside the head tube, slide the other race over the 
fork steering tube and down into the top cup of the head tube.
 
13. Slide any washers or spacers over the fork steering tube in their 
original order.

14. Attach the top cap and screw it into place with the Allen bolt.
 
15. Follow the procedure for headset adjustment in the “Threadless 
headsets” section under “Adjusting your headset.”
 
16. Center the stem and secure it by tightening the clamp bolt or bolts.

268
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
If you replace a headset with the same model, you’ll be able to install it your-
self in most cases — you won’t have to press the head-tube cups into the 
frame because you can reuse the ones currently in place. However, if you 
change headsets, you’ll need your local bike shop to install it. Special tools 
along with skill and expertise are required for removing headset parts from a 
bike frame and installing new ones.
Threaded headsets
When you overhaul a threaded headset, you’ll likely observe the reason for 
its name — the threaded steerer tube that sits at the top of a fork. You’ll also 
see that a threaded headset is unique with its expander bolt, something that 
helps keep it in place when tightened.
To overhaul a threaded headset, follow these steps:
 
1. Use an Allen wrench, or adjustable wrench if needed, to loosen the 
socket head bolt, which sits at the top of the stem.
 
 Turn it just a few times to loosen it. Do not completely remove this bolt. 
It’s connected to an expander wedge at the bottom of the stem, which 
keeps the stem in place. Sometimes the bolt may be buried deep inside 
the stem and require a longer Allen wrench (see Figure 15-18).
 
2. After the bolt is loosened, place a small block of wood on it and give it 
a firm blow with a hammer to jar the wedge loose.
 
 If the stem has not been removed for a while it may take more than one 
blow and/or some penetrating lubricant.
 
3. Lift the stem out of the steering tube connected to the fork (as shown 
in Figure 15-19).

Loosening 
the socket 
head bolt.
 

269
 Chapter 15: Turning on a Dime: The Steering System
 
Figure 15-19:

4. Remove the headset locknut by turning it in a counterclockwise 
direction (as shown in Figure 15-20).
 
Figure 15-20: 
Undoing the 
locknut.
 

270
Part III: Shifting into a Higher Gear: Advanced Bike Repairs 
 
5. Slide off any washers or anything else that sits underneath the locknut 
you just removed.
 
6. Unscrew the adjustable cup or cone that sits against the top of the 
head tube.
 
 As you do, hold on to the fork with one hand so that it doesn’t fall to 
the ground.
 
 There is a top and bottom or an inside and outside of the bearing race. 
Take note of the bearing race positioning before removing it. If you don’t 
reinstall it properly, you won’t be able to adjust the headset and you’ll 
damage the bearings and the headset.
 
 Be careful with the bearings that sit in the top and bottom of the head 
tube. If they’re contained within a race, you’re in good shape; if they’re 
loose, they may fall out when you remove the adjustable cup or slide out 
of the fork. In the case of loose bearings, remove the top set before you 
slide out the fork. Then turn the bike upside down to remove the fork 
and the bottom set.
 
7. Inspect the bearings to see if they’re pitted or worn.
 
 If they are, they should be replaced.
 
8. Clean and inspect all parts.
 
9. When you’re ready to reinstall the headset, coat both cups with a layer 
of grease.
 
10. Insert one of the retainers into the bottom cup.
 
11. While holding the bottom retainer into place with one hand, insert the 
fork with the other hand.
 
 This procedure is sometimes easier if you turn the bike over.
 
12. After the fork is inside the head tube, slide the other race over the 
fork steering tube and down into the top cup of the head tube.
 
13. Screw on the adjustable cup or cone until it presses down slightly on 
the bearings.
 
14. Slide any washers, locknut, and anything else over the fork steering 
tube in their original order.
 
15. Follow the procedure in the “Threaded headsets” section under 
“Adjusting your headset.”
 
16. Insert the stem and, when it’s at the correct height, turn the bolt 
clockwise.
 
 This will expand the wedge at the bottom of the stem and hold it in place.
 
 When you adjust the height of the stem, don’t set it higher than the 
safety limit marking engraved into the side of the stem. It may have 
faded over time, so you need to look carefully to find it.

f we had to pick just one part of this book to recom-
mend, it would be this one. If you follow the advice in 
these chapters and make a commitment to regular bike 
maintenance, you won’t need to spend as much time 
with the other chapters of this book, because your bike 
will be maintained in good working order. In this part, we 
cover everything you need to know about maintenance, 
including preventive maintenance (such as regular lubri-
cation and cleaning), monthly maintenance, and yearly 
overhauls — all steps that are designed to help you 
enjoy years of trouble-free biking.

f you’re like us, you once had a bike that you never took care of — probably 
when you were a kid. Dennis had a BMX-style bike in his teens that he almost 
killed himself on, pushing it to the limits on dirt trails and bike jumps that he 
and his friends engineered after school. Despite all the punishment Dennis 
dished out on that bike, it valiantly held up to give him several pleasurable 
years of riding.
Modern-day bikes are designed with durable components that can take a lot 
of wear and tear, but this doesn’t mean that you should neglect your bike the 
way you did when you didn’t know any better. The old adage that an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure is especially true when it comes to your 
bike. If you follow the guidelines in this chapter for preventive maintenance, 
not only will you extend the life of your bike, but you’ll have fewer repairs to 
make, you’ll be safer, and you’ll get more enjoyment out of riding.
In this chapter, we explain some simple steps you can take before, during, 
and after riding to care for your bike and extend its life. Cleaning and lubricat-
ing your bike is at the top of the list, but don’t stop there. You can do a quick 
inspection before you ride, follow some basic rules while riding to minimize 
wear and tear on your bike, and properly store your bike when your ride is 
over. We cover all these steps in this chapter.

274
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Before You Ride
If you’re like a lot of bikers, when you finally have some time for a ride, the 
last thing you want to be thinking about is repair and maintenance. You grab 
your helmet and gloves and you’re out the door, ready to roll.
But you can improve your bike’s performance, prevent major headaches, and 
improve your own safety by doing a few simple things before you ride. In this 
section, we fill you in.
Assembling an emergency tool kit
Assembling an emergency tool kit is essential if you plan on doing anything 
more than taking a trip around the block. You’ll want to bring along a basic 
set of tools so that when the inevitable breakdown happens, you won’t be 
stranded on the side of the road.
When you’re shopping for tools, look for ones that are light, so that they 
won’t weigh you down, especially on longer trips. Size is also a consideration 
especially because you’ll want to stow away your tools in a pouch under your 
seat or tucked away in a bike bag. You don’t want to try biking if you have 
a large crescent wrench sticking out from under your seat. Your best bet is 
to visit your local bike shop to find small, lightweight tools to take with you 
when you bike.
 
Look at multipurpose tools — they provide a lot of functionality in one small, 
convenient package. Also, some bike shops offer kits with everything you need 
already assembled.
Putting together a basic tool kit
For starters, we recommend that you include the following tools in your 
emergency tool kit. (After you have some biking experience, you may decide 
to change or add to it.)
 
✓ Small frame-mounted tire pump: If you’ve been doing any biking already, 
you probably already have a tire pump — but you may not have a small 
one that you can mount on your frame. If you don’t already have one of 
these small, frame-mounted pumps, put this at the top of your list.
 
✓ Tire patch kit: Patching a flat tire is an unavoidable part of biking, and a 
tire patch kit is essential. A patch kit includes patches, glue, and a tool 
to rough up the surface of the tube to improve adhesion.
 
✓ Spare inner tube: If your tube explodes, you’ll have to replace it with a 
new one, so carrying a spare inner tube with you is important.

275
 Chapter 16: An Ounce of Preventive Maintenance
 
✓ Tire levers: Unless you have an a racing bike that uses tubular tires, 
you’ll need tire levers to remove and install a tire.
 
✓ Allen wrenches: You’ll need these for adjusting various parts of your 
bike. Most Allen wrenches come in a kit or as a part of a multipurpose 
tool with the most popular sizes found on a bike.
 
✓ Screwdrivers: You’ll need both a flathead screwdriver and a Phillips 
screwdriver for adjusting derailleurs and other parts of your bike. You 
may need a regular-size screwdriver and a smaller one depending on 
your bike.
 
✓ Spoke wrench: You need a spoke wrench that fits the spoke nipples on 
your bike. To determine what size spoke wrench you need, visit your 
local bike shop and ask for help.
 
✓ Pliers: You’ll need pliers for pulling cables.
 
✓ Multipurpose tool: Many bike shops offer a multipurpose tool, which 
includes screwdrivers, Allen wrenches, a chain tool, and other types 
of tools.
 
✓ Rag: You’ll use clean rags to wipe your hands after some messy repair 
jobs. You can also use a rag when you’re checking tires for flats, han-
dling chains, and so on.
 
✓ Small light: If you have to stay out later than expected, it’s good to have 
a light that you can clip to your bike when it gets dark. You may want to 
have an LED light permanently mounted or clipped to your bike. A rear 
blinking light is a good idea, too. Lights are inexpensive, and the front 
light at least is a legal requirement.
Adding tools for an extended trip
As biking becomes more popular, many riders are discovering the enjoyment 
in taking extended trips on their bikes. If you’re planning a bike trip that will 
last for more than a day or two, you need to add some additional tools and 
parts to your emergency tool kit (see the preceding section).
Which tools you should take depends on where you’re biking and for how 
long. If you’ll be passing through a lot of small towns, chances are pretty 
good that you can find a local bike shop to help you in a jam. Dennis has 
taken extended trips through Europe where he’s been able to pack very few 
tools because of the popularity of biking and the large number of local bike 
shops along the way. Once, on the outskirts of Limerick, Ireland, he had a 
minor accident and ruined some spokes. A passerby stopped to help and 
eventually took Dennis and his bike to a bike shop in town. After Dennis’s 
bike was repaired, the friendly passerby invited him back to his house where 
his family gave Dennis a warm bed and a traditional Irish breakfast the next 
morning. Although we don’t recommend having an accident to meet people, 
this was one of the highlights of Dennis’s time in Ireland.

276
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Although, in many cases, you’ll be able to find help if you break down on the 
side of the road, you’re better off being ready to handle the repair on your 
own. For extended trips, we recommend having everything from the preced-
ing section, as well as the following additional tools:
 
✓ Spare tire: A number of companies make tires that can be folded and 
packed away. Surprisingly enough, folding tires are often actually better-
quality tires, just with a foldable Kevlar bead instead of a stiff wire bead.
 
✓ Extra tubes: If you ride across something on the road that blows out 
a tube, there is always a chance that you’ll hit it with your back tire as 
well, so keep two, just in case.
 
✓ Chain tool: A longer trip increases your chances of having issues with 
your chain, and you’ll need this tool to take it apart and reconnect it.
 
✓ Chain links and rivets: If you have issues with your chain, you may need 
to replace links. Have extra rivets or connecting links available for when 
you reconnect the chain.
 
✓ Spare spokes: In our experience, spoke problems are one of the top 
three or four issues that you’ll encounter on an extended trip. Keep at 
least two spare spokes on hand. Be sure to confirm what sizes you need.
 
 On some bikes, the size of the spokes can differ on the front and rear 
wheels and even within the same wheel.
 
✓ Spare cables: If you’re on an extended trip, your bike will likely be packed 
down with extra weight, which puts additional strain on your cables. 
Pack a replacement cable for the brakes and one for the derailleur.
 
✓ Lubrication: You’ll want to keep the parts of your bike — especially the 
chain — properly lubricated during your trip.
 
✓ Duct tape: This is the all-purpose MacGyver tool. If you have to hold 
something together on your bike until you get to the next town, duct 
tape may do the job.
Giving your bike the once-over: 
A pre-ride inspection
Next time you head out for a ride, take a moment to do a quick inspection of 
your bike. It’ll only take a few minutes and you just might prevent a bigger 
problem from happening. Trust us: You don’t want to be discovering that you 
have an issue with your brakes as you’re going full-speed down a hill.
In the following sections, we cover all the things you should check before 
each and every ride.

277
 Chapter 16: An Ounce of Preventive Maintenance
Wheels
The quick-release levers on the wheels should be securely positioned in the 
closed position. Open and close the levers once to confirm that they’re tight. 
If you find that they’re loose, open the lever, turn the nut opposite the lever 
a quarter-turn and re-close the lever. When you’re sure that the levers are 
secure, move the wheel side to side check for looseness. Next, lift the wheel 
off the ground and give it a spin to see that it doesn’t wobble and that the rim 
doesn’t contact the brake pads at any point.
Tires
Check the air pressure of your tires with a pressure gauge and compare it 
with the recommended pressure listed on the sidewall. Under-inflated tires 
will drastically increase the rolling resistance, thereby increasing the amount 
of energy needed to pedal the bicycle. Properly inflated tires also better 
absorb any impact and protect the wheel from damage.
While you’re checking the pressure, visually inspect the tires, looking for any 
cracks, cuts, or tears.
Brakes
Give the brake levers a strong squeeze to ensure that the brakes firmly 
grip the wheels — you shouldn’t have to pull the levers more than halfway 
to the handlebars. Next, examine the brake pads and make sure they have 
sufficient rubber. Also pay attention to their position relative to the rim — 
they shouldn’t be too high (because they’ll rub a hole in the tire) or too low 
(because they could slip down into the spokes). There should be 1mm to 
2mm of space between the pads and the rim.
Handlebars
Straddle the front wheel pinching it between your thighs. Grip the handlebars 
and try to twist them side to side. Try the same procedure, but this time 
straddle the frame, squeeze the brakes, and try to rock the bicycle back and 
forth. If there’s play in the handlebars or stem, it could mean either that the 
clamp bolts need to be tightened or you have a loose headset, which could 
be dangerous at high speeds.
Pedals and cranks
Just as you checked for looseness with the handlebars (see the preceding 
section), you’ll want to do the same with the pedals and cranks. First, grab a 
crank in each hand and try to shake them. If there is looseness, fixing it may 
be as simple as tightening the crank bolts, or you may have issues with the 
bottom bracket. Confirm that the pedals spin freely but that you can’t pull 
them away from the cranks.

278
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
While You Ride
One of the best ways to extend the life of your bike doesn’t require a 
special tool or a fresh application of lube. All you have to do is be careful 
when you ride.
Although modern bikes are designed to withstand a significant amount of 
punishment, try to avoid riding in a way that puts additional strain on your 
bike or, even worse, increases the likelihood of an accident. Here are some 
steps you can take while riding, to prolong the life of your bike:
 
✓ Pay attention to the road in front of you. Your goal is to avoid obstacles 
like rocks, potholes, and other hazards, which, if impacted, could result in 
a bent rim or other problem.
 
✓ Instead of jumping or riding across a curb, dismount and walk 
your bike.
 
✓ Shift into your lowest gear before you reach the steepest section of a 
climb. Trying to shift when you’re barely moving puts a lot of strain on 
the chain and derailleurs. If the chain springs off the largest cog, into the 
spokes, the damage will be even greater.
 
✓ If you have to go over a bump, raise yourself off the saddle and use 
your arms and legs as shock absorbers as if you were a horse jockey. 
This lessens the impact of the blow.
When riding, you should listen to your bike. If it makes awkward noises or 
grinds in certain operations, it’s time to diagnose the ailment before it gets 
worse and destroys internal parts.
After You Ride
Even though you may be ready to relax and kick back with a cold one after 
your ride, if you take care of a few issues (like cleaning and lubricating your 
bike), your bike will last longer.
Cleaning your bike
Unless you’re a part of the U.S. Olympic team and are training on an indoor 
track, your bike is going to get dirty. If you’re like us and you love the outdoors, 
you probably don’t mind dirt. Hopping on a mountain bike and plowing your 
way through mud-covered mountain passes and rolling streams may bring 
back the joy of childhood and your mother chasing you through the house as 
you left muddy footprints behind.

279
 Chapter 16: An Ounce of Preventive Maintenance
Your bike feels much differently about dirt and grime, though. Dirt acts as an 
abrasive and, as it works its way into the internal parts of your bike, it starts 
wearing out bearings and other components. Even if your bike isn’t covered 
in mud and grime, dust can build up inside the chain, gears, bearings, and 
other parts. A bike that you haven’t washed for a while because you think it’s 
fairly clean may be wearing out unnecessarily with each turn of the crank.
If you could do only one thing in this book to care for your bike, it would be 
to wash your bike frequently. If you ride in wet, muddy, or dusty weather, 
we recommend that you clean your bike immediately at the end of your ride. 
If you ride your bike in normal conditions, you probably can get away with 
cleaning it every week or two (maybe longer, if you live in a dry climate).
If your bike appears fairly clean after riding, all it may need is a quick wipe-
down. Use a damp cloth or paper towels to wipe off any dust or dirt that may 
have accumulated on the frame, the fork, the handlebars, and the cranks.
If your bike is a dirty or hasn’t been cleaned in a week or two, it’s time to do a 
serious cleaning. Here are the supplies you need to clean your bike:
 
✓ Bucket
 
✓ Dishwashing soap, car cleaner, or a cleaner from your local bike shop
 
✓ Sponge
 
✓ Brushes (such as a toothbrush, bottle brush, and a bathroom cleaning 
brush, or a specialized brush designed to clean hard-to-reach places on 
your bike, such as between the sprockets)
 
✓ Degreaser
 
✓ A clean rag
 
✓ Car wax
 
If you have a bike stand, use it to clean your bike. You’ll be able to rotate the 
cranks to clean the chain and you’ll have easier access to other parts of the 
bike, such as the rear derailleur.
To clean your bike properly, follow these steps:
 
1. Fill a bucket with warm water and a cleaning agent.
 
2. Wet your bike with a hose without a spray nozzle.
 
 Avoid spraying water directly at your bike, especially toward the hubs 
or bottom bracket. This may force water and dirt into your bearings and 
break down the grease in which they’re packed.

280
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
 
3. Use a brush or sponge and soapy water, and brush off as much caked-
on mud or dirt from the bike as you can.
 
 Brush in between the sprockets to remove any dirt trapped inside (see 
Figure 16-1.
 
4. Spray degreaser on the freewheel, derailleur, chain, and chain ring 
(see Figure 16-2).
 
 Allow a couple of minutes for the degreaser to penetrate the parts, and 
then brush it off with a brush.
 
5. Use a brush or sponge to wash down the entire bike.
 
 Make sure you dig out dirt between the cogs and wherever else it hides. 
A specially designed brush (available as most bike shops) is useful for 
this procedure (see Figure 16-3).
 
6. Rinse the bike with a hose.
 
7. Dry the bike using a clean rag.
 
 You can use a rag or a strip of cloth to wipe away water from between the 
sprockets (see Figure 16-4), beside the hubs, and around the derailleurs.

9. Lubricate your bike following the steps in the next section.
 
 When you remove grease on your bike by cleaning it, you’ll need to 
lubricate its parts afterwards. Washing and lubricating your bike go 
hand in hand — if you wash your bike, you should be prepared to follow 
it with a lube job.
Giving your bike a lube job
When you clean your bike, you’ll likely remove a lot of lubrication and your 
bike will be thirsty for a fresh dose of oil and grease.
If you’re a typical recreational rider, you may only have to give your bike 
a quick lube job every week or two. But if you’re riding in wet weather or 
you’re taking long bike trips, you should oil your bike more frequently. Just 
like the pre-ride inspection (earlier in this chapter), a lube job is quick and 
easy — you can do it in a few minutes, and it’ll provide many benefits for 
your bike.

283
 Chapter 16: An Ounce of Preventive Maintenance
 
Many of the parts of a bike that require oil are not fully exposed, which makes 
it harder to get the oil into the right place. For this, we recommend using a 
spray can with a thin, straw-like extension. You’ll be able to insert the exten-
sion into small, hard-to-reach areas such as inside the brake levers.
Here are the parts of your bike you’ll want to lubricate after cleaning:
 
✓ Brakes: Spray some oil into the brake pivot points to keep them in 
working order and to prevent rust (see Figure 16-5). Be careful not to 
get any on the brake pads or rims, because this will impact your bike’s 
braking capacity. Also, give a shot of lube to the spot where the cable is 
attached.
 
✓ Brake levers: Apply oil to the brake-lever pivots (see Figure 16-6). Pull 
back on the brake lever and spray the exposed cable. Be sure to cover 
the cable adjusters with lube to protect them from rust.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Lubricating 
the brakes.
 

284
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
 
✓ Derailleurs: There are several pivot points where the front and rear 
derailleurs move. Cover each of these with a quick shot of lube. On the 
front derailleur, lubricate the pivot point (see Figure 16-7) On the rear 
derailleur, be sure to spray both of the pulley wheels (see Figure 16-8).

285
 Chapter 16: An Ounce of Preventive Maintenance
 
Figure 16-8:

the rear 
derailleur.
 
 
✓ Chain and sprockets: Of all the parts to lubricate on a bike, the chain 
is the most important. A poorly lubricated chain will wear out quickly 
and can shorten the lifespan of your chainrings and sprocket. Apply 
an even amount of lube to the chain while you’re turning the cranks 
(see Figure 16-9). You want to make sure that the oil does more than 
coat the surface but works its way into the individual chain links. If 
you notice that there is buildup of dirt and grime on the chain, clean it 
first with a degreaser and then apply a fresh coat of lubrication. When 
you’re finished with the chain, apply a few drops of lube to the sprock-
ets (see Figure 16-10).
 
✓ Cables: Give a light spray of oil to where the inner cable exits from 
the cable housing (see Figure 16-11). If you have a couple of minutes, 
remove the cable from the stop and give a spray into the cable housing.
 
After you’re done lubricating your bike, be sure to use a rag and wipe any 
excess oil off your bike to prevent it from attracting dirt and grime.

Storing your bike
How you store your bike is an important factor in its maintenance. Protecting 
your bike from the elements should be the most important consideration in 
storing it. Even for short-term storage such as overnight or for a few days, 
you should try to bring it indoors whenever possible. If you leave it outside, 
it’ll be more exposed to wind, rain, and dirt, all of which can have a negative 
effect on your bike.
 
If you must store your bike outside for any period of time, consider buying a 
bike cover or even a tarp. This will provide some protection from rain and 
from dust and dirt blowing into its parts.
If you live in a part of the country that has a less-than-forgiving climate, you 
may want to store your bike for a longer period of time. If you’re planning on 
taking your bike off the road for an extended period of time and keeping it in 
storage, take the following steps to preserve its condition:

288
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
 
✓ Give it a complete cleaning and lube job. This is the most basic step 
you can take before storing your bike.
 
✓ Overhaul the hubs, bottom bracket, headset, and derailleurs; pack 
all the bearings in fresh grease; and true the wheels. If you do all this 
before you put your bike in storage, it’ll be ready to roll as soon as that 
first warm day of spring arrives.
 
✓ Give your tires and tubes a break by letting the air out.
 
✓ Release the brake and shifter cables to take pressure off the springs. 
Some people argue that most modern metals won’t weaken from the 
continuous tension, but we like to take this step anyway. If you’d rather 
not take this step, you should at least open the quick-release mechanism 
for the brakes and shift the chain onto the smallest front sprocket and 
smallest rear cog — this is usually the derailleur position with the least 
spring tension.
Store your bike indoors to protect it from the elements. This will help limit 
moisture and prevent rusting of internal parts. Also, avoid storing your bike 
where it could be knocked over — the rear derailleur is vulnerable and could 
be damaged in a fall.
 
Consider hanging your bike from a hook on the wall or ceiling — either by the 
wheels or by the frame. Not only will you save some space but you’ll protect 
the tires from supporting weight in the same position for a long period of time. 
Dennis thinks a bike hanging on the wall is a decorative touch for a room, 
although not everyone (including his wife) agrees with him on that.

Chapter 17
Regular Bike Maintenance
In This Chapter
▶ Performing monthly maintenance on your bike
▶ Doing an annual overhaul of your bike
O
wning a bike has its privileges. Zipping around turns, wind rushing 
through your hair, passing cars in traffic, leaving the world and all your 
cares behind you as you ride off into the countryside — it doesn’t get much 
better than this! Of course, owning a bike also entails responsibilities. Unless 
you have unlimited money and don’t mind buying a new bike every year or 
two, caring for and maintaining your bike is important.
Maintenance is also critical if you care about personal safety. Unless you’re 
an 18-year-old risk taker, you probably aren’t willing to take the chance that 
making a sharp turn, dodging a pothole, or slamming on the brakes will land 
you in the emergency room. Keeping your bike in good working order by fol-
lowing the monthly and yearly maintenance steps outlined in this chapter will 
go a long way toward making your riding experience a safe and enjoyable one.
 
Whether you’re enthusiastic about maintenance or you view it as a chore, take 
the time today to schedule it. Write it on your calendar, put it in your PDA, do 
whatever it takes to remind yourself to do it. Otherwise, it’s likely to get lost in 
the shuffle of your busy life, no matter how good your intentions.
We start this chapter by telling you what you need to do every month to 
maintain the health of your bike. Monthly maintenance is all about keeping 
your bike clean and lubricated and inspecting your bike for potential safety 
issues. You can do this monthly maintenance check in 30 minutes or less. We 
end the chapter with the annual tune-up and overhaul, which requires more 
time but will dramatically extend the life and safety of your bike.

290
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Monthly Maintenance
Once a month, set aside half an hour or so to give your bike the once-over. 
Specifically, there are nine steps that you should take every month — every-
thing from checking the tires to cleaning.
 
One way to stay on top of your monthly maintenance is to choose a day of the 
month that you can easily remember. For example, if your birthday is June 13, 
do your maintenance on the 13th day of every month.
Surveying your bike for structural damage
Examine your bike for signs of stress and structural damage. Visually inspect 
each part of the frame for cracks or other visible signs of wear and tear. For 
the hard-to-see parts of the frame, such as the underside, rub your hands 
along the surface to feel for bumps or ripples. Pay particular attention to 
areas where the frame is welded. On aluminum frames, in particular, look for 
any hairline cracks or weak points.
Hold the wheel between your legs and turn the handlebars side to side. If 
there is movement in the handlebar or stem, you may need to tighten the 
clamp bolts on the handlebars, tighten the stem bolt, or adjust your headset 
(see Chapter 15).
Kicking the tires
Lift each tire off the ground and give it a spin to see if it’s spinning in alignment. 
As the wheel spins, keep your eyes fixed on the brake pad as it rotates, looking 
for any wobble. If you see any wobble, it’s probably time to true the wheel (see 
“Truing the wheel,” later in this chapter).
 
You’ll be able to examine the alignment better if you have a bike stand. 
You can also turn the bike upside down, being careful to protect the shifters. 
Or have a friend lift the tire off the ground while you spin the wheel and 
examine it.
Also, inspect the tires for signs of wear, such as cracks, cuts, tears, or bulg-
ing. If you have a badly worn tire, it should be replaced immediately (see 
Chapter 6). Examine the tread and remove any debris or objects that may be 
lodged inside.

291
 Chapter 17: Regular Bike Maintenance
Finally, check for tightness in the spokes. Check two spokes at a time, grab-
bing them between your thumb and finger to test for what should be an even 
tension around the wheel. In the rear wheel, one side may have a slightly 
different tension then the other, but these should be uniform for each half. If 
you find any spokes that have too much or too little tension, make an adjust-
ment with a spoke wrench (see Chapter 7).
Cleaning your bike
Even though we recommend in Chapter 16 that you give your bike a proper 
cleaning after every ride (if you ride in especially muddy or dirty conditions) 
or at least weekly, let’s face it: Most people probably won’t do it that often. 
If you don’t have the time to clean your bike after every ride or once a week, 
you really do need to do it during your monthly inspection.
 
Dirt is your bike’s worst enemy. Over time, it works its way into your bike’s 
parts, causing them to wear out faster.
Turn to Chapter 16 for instructions on how to properly clean your bike.
 
Cleaning your bike is easier the more frequently you do it. If you wait until it’s 
caked in mud and covered in grime, it’ll take you a lot longer to get the job 
done. If you stay on top of cleaning after every ride (or at least once a week), 
you’ll be able to finish the job much faster.
Giving your bike a lube job
You probably wouldn’t dream of driving your car without changing the oil 
every three months or 3,000 miles. And you should take the same approach 
with your bike.
Your bike has many movable parts that require lubrication to reduce friction 
and stay in good working order. A lube job is especially important if you’ve 
been riding frequently, if you’ve been riding in wet or dry conditions, or if 
you’ve just cleaned your bike.
Turn to Chapter 16 for instructions on how to properly lube the moving parts 
and pivot points on your bike.

292
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Tightening up
The monthly checkup is a good time to inspect the tightness of your cables. 
While you’re examining the cables, also look for kinks or fraying, which may 
signal that they need to be replaced.
Check all the fasteners on your bike for looseness. Don’t forgot to include 
any accessories like racks or bottle cages in your list. If you leave a fastener 
loose, it may fall out and, in its place, rust may appear.
Finally, check the cranks and crank bolts or nuts for tightness. While inspecting 
the cranks, grab a crank arm in each hand and try to wiggle them to check for 
looseness. If there is play in the cranks, the nuts or bolts may need to be tight-
ened or you may have a problem with the bottom bracket (see Chapter 13).
Checking the brakes
Of all the parts on a bike that you don’t want to give out when you’re riding, 
the brakes are at the top of the list. Make sure you inspect them monthly, 
checking for wear in the brake pads and replacing them as needed. (If you 
need to replace brake pads or make adjustments to the brakes, see Chapter 8.)
Confirm that the cable clamp has the cable securely in place.
Give your brake levers a firm squeeze to confirm that the brakes evenly and 
firmly grab the rim.
Check the brake pads for even wear. (You may need to take the wheel off 
for this.) If any debris is lodged in the pads, remove it with the tip of a key 
or a knife.
While you’re looking at the brakes, rub down the rims with rubbing alcohol. 
Clean, grease-free rims will increase your braking power and extend the life 
of your brake pads.
Examining the chain, cogs, and chainrings
Over time, a chain will stretch as it wears and, eventually, it’ll need to be 
replaced. A stretched chain will cause the chainrings and cogs to wear out 
more quickly.

293
 Chapter 17: Regular Bike Maintenance
How do you know if your chain is stretched? Pull a chain link away from 
the chainring, and see if you can expose a gap between the chain and the 
chainring. If you can, the chain is stretched. You can also measure the chain 
to confirm that 12 links measure 12 inches. If the link measures between 121/8 
to 121/4 inches, it’s time to replace the chain (see Chapter 10).
 
Some companies offer a special tool that accurately indicates the amount of 
chain stretch.
Also, examine the teeth of the chainrings and cogs for excessive wear. If the 
teeth are no longer symmetrical and look like an ocean wave or as though 
they’ve been filed down on one side, it’s time to replace the part.
Protecting your saddle
If you have a leather saddle, use a leather treatment to clean the leather and 
replenish its natural oils. These oils help the leather repel dirt and water, both 
of which can break down the integrity of the leather. Although a number of 
products are on the market, Brooks Proofide is a wax-based treatment that is 
very popular with bikers. (For more information on saddles, see Chapter 9.)
Inspecting the suspension
If you have suspension on your bike, inspect all suspension pivot and linkage 
bolts for correct tightness. Proper tightness is critical in order for the sus-
pension to work properly. Follow the directions in your owner’s manual and 
consider using a torque wrench or taking your bike to your local bike shop 
for adjustment.
Also, inspect the suspension forks. If they use oil, examine them for leaks 
and follow your owner’s manual for how often the oil should be changed. If 
they’re air-sprung, check the air pressure. (For more information on suspen-
sion, see Chapter 12.)
Annual Maintenance
After cleaning and lubricating your bike regularly, the next most important 
thing you can do to extend the life of your bike is to give it a yearly overhaul. 
You wouldn’t think of driving your car year after year without taking it in 
for service — you have to think about your bike the same way, especially if 
you’ve invested money in a quality bike and you want to have many years of 
comfortable, accident-free biking.

294
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Annual maintenance is not difficult if you follow the directions in this section — 
however unlike preventive and monthly maintenance, it does take some time. 
Overhauling a bike is not something you can do in 30 minutes, especially the 
first time. To do it right, you should set aside an afternoon when you can focus 
on your bike and nothing else.
Deep-cleaning the chain
Even if you’ve been fastidiously cleaning your chain on a regular basis, once 
a year you should give it a deep cleaning by removing it and soaking it in a 
solvent like Finish Line Citrus Degreaser or another environmentally safe 
product.
 
Try putting the solvent of your choice, along with the chain, in a soda bottle, 
giving the bottle a few shakes, and letting it sit for a few hours. Soaking your 
chain will enable the solvent to penetrate into the links, giving you deeper 
clean than if you had used a chain cleaning tool. When it’s finished soaking, 
brush off the chain and rinse with water. Dry off the chain with a towel, and let 
it air-dry for a few hours. Don’t apply lubricant until the solvent has com-
pletely evaporated.
For more chain cleaning tips, check out Chapter 10.
Truing the wheels
Over the course of the year, your wheels are going to absorb a lot of impact. 
The accumulation of bumps and jolts that are normal when you ride may 
start to loosen spokes causing your wheels to start to wobble. To counteract 
this, at least once a year have your wheels trued. Truing is the process of 
adjusting the tension in the spokes so that the wheel spins straight.
Wheel truing is a lot like golf: The basic concept is easy, but it takes a lot of 
practice to master. The process of truing is best left to an expert, but you 
should be able to make a few minor spoke adjustments to eliminate some of 
the imperfections in the wheel — all you’ll need is a spoke wrench.
Although professionals use a special truing stand that provides greater preci-
sion, enabling them to correct up-and-down and side-to-side wobbles, you 
can leave your wheels in the frame when you true them. Just make sure you 
remove the tires so that you can see any distortions in the rim.
For instructions on how to true a wheel, turn to Chapter 7.

295
 Chapter 17: Regular Bike Maintenance
Replacing cables and housing
Considering the important role that cables play on your bike, especially 
when it comes to braking and stopping, we recommend that you think about 
replacing the cables and the housing in which they sit every year — or, at a 
minimum, give both a very thorough inspection. If you notice any kinks, rust-
ing, fraying, or a buildup of dirt and grime, it probably is time to install new 
ones. If you do install new ones, we recommend that longer-lasting stainless 
steels cables be used. Follow the instructions in Chapter 8 and Chapter 15 to 
install cables for brakes and derailleurs, respectively.
 
Most bikes use one type of cable housing for shifters and another for brakes. 
Cable housing for shifting should not be used for brakes, because it may not 
be able to handle the higher force applied during severe breaking.
 
When you go to your local bike shop to purchase cables, remember to bring 
along the old cable. This way, you’ll find the right cable for your bike and 
won’t buy more length of cable than is necessary.
If, after inspecting the cables, you feel they don’t need to be replaced, give 
them a proper cleaning. Remove the inner wire and flush the cable housing 
with a light oil, and remove cable grit with a rag while the cable is removed 
from the housing. Clean the inner wire with the same solvent before inserting 
it back into the cable housing.
 
Most cable housings have an inner plastic or Teflon liner, which means that 
the cable doesn’t have to be lubricated. If you aren’t sure about your cable 
housing, ask your local bike shop.
Overhauling the hubs
In order to extend the life of your hubs, it’s good practice to overhaul them at 
least once a year — especially if they’ve been exposed to a lot water, which 
can cause them to rust from the inside.
One way to test whether an overhaul is needed is to elevate the wheel off the 
ground and give it a good spin. It should rotate freely, with the valve coming 
to a stop at the bottom, because this is the heaviest part of the wheel. 
Another test is to lift the wheel, grabbing the wheel with one hand and grab-
bing the frame with the other. If there is play in the wheel when you move it 
side to side, this is another sign that an overhaul, or at least an adjustment, 
is in order. Another test is to rotate the axle with your fingers with the wheel 
stationary; the hub should feel butter smooth.

296
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
If you have traditional hubs with bearings held in place by a cup and cone, 
you’ll want to inspect the bearings, replace them if needed, and repack the 
bearings in fresh grease.
If you have cartridge bearing hubs, you’re in luck. These require less main-
tenance because the bearings are sealed inside the cartridge. With some 
sealed cartridges, you can squirt degreaser into the cartridge followed by an 
injection of fresh grease as part of your servicing, although this is probably 
not something you need to do on a yearly basis unless you’re riding in severe 
conditions such as crossing a river.
You can find step-by-step instructions for overhauling the hubs in Chapter 7.
Overhauling the headset
Wear and tear will cause a headset to come loose over time, which may cause 
the steering to feel wobbly or the breaking to vibrate the bike. Looseness in 
the headset also causes the bearings inside the headset to be impacted each 
time you hit a bump, which will lead them to deteriorate faster. If you think 
the headset may be loose, turn to Chapter 16 and follow the steps for check-
ing for looseness in the handlebars.
Yearly maintenance is a good time to inspect, clean, adjust, and overhaul 
the headset. As is the case with all parts that rely on bearings, you’ll want 
to clean and degrease each part, if possible; replace and pack the bearings 
in fresh grease; and then reinstall the parts following the instructions in 
Chapter 15.
 
Don’t try to install a new headset on your bike unless you know what you’re 
doing. Most bike shops have special tools that they use to fit a headset.
Overhauling the pedals
The sign that it’s time for a pedal adjustment are similar to those of other 
parts that rely on bearings to spin smoothly. If pedals don’t rotate effort-
lessly, or they wobble or feel loose, you should overhaul them. You’ll have 
your tools, cleaners, and lubricants out during your annual maintenance, so 
it’s a convenient time to take care of the pedals.
As with hubs, pedals have traditional cup-and-cone or cartridge bearings. If 
you have cup-and-cone bearings, you’ll want to replace the bearings before 
packing them in fresh grease. With cartridge bearing systems, which are found 
on most clipless pedals, you’ll only have to add fresh grease every few years.
You can find the steps for overhauling pedals in Chapter 13.

297
 Chapter 17: Regular Bike Maintenance
Overhauling the bottom bracket
The bottom bracket is the last bearing-dependent component you have to 
deal with in your annual maintenance. The bottom bracket is designed to 
stand up to all the hours of rigorous pedaling that your legs can put out, but 
even so, it’s a good idea to overhaul it once a year.
 
You may want to leave this task to your local bike shop, especially because it 
calls for some special hand tools, may entail a lot of force to loosen, and 
requires the application of the proper amount of torque when tightening. If 
that isn’t a hurdle for you, follow the instructions in Chapter 13 for inspecting, 
cleaning, lubing, and reassembling the bottom bracket.
Cleaning the rear derailleur
Where dirt and grime builds up most on a rear derailleur is on the two jockey 
wheels. The focus of your annual cleaning of the rear derailleur should be on 
cleaning the overall derailleur, without disassembling it, and cleaning the two 
jockey wheels.
Whenever you remove the rear derailleur, try to do so without breaking 
the chain. You can do this by removing the bolt holding the bottom pulley 
wheel in place and loosening the bolt holding the top pulley. This will allow 
you to separate the S-shaped cage and slide out the chain. After the chain is 
removed, you can detach the entire derailleur for a thorough degreasing and 
lubrication before you reattach it.
For details on cleaning your rear derailleur, refer to Chapter 14.
Replacing the brake pads
The only thing between you and your next emergency stop is a thin rubber 
pad, so we highly recommend changing your brake pads every year. Brake 
pads are easy to inspect, cheap to purchase, and simple to install, so don’t 
wait for the annual maintenance period to change them if they’re worn — 
keep an eye on them year-round and take caution to make sure pads are 
properly fit and securely mounted.
As soon as the grooves that are cut into the pads start wearing down, 
replace them.
For instructions on changing brake pads, turn to Chapter 8.

298
Part IV: Keeping Your Bike on the Road 
Replacing the handlebar grips or tape
After a year’s worth of riding, your bike may start looking a little ragged. 
The annual maintenance of your bike is your chance not just to get it back 
in working order but to give it back some of that glow that’s lost after many 
hard miles of working for you.
Replacing dirty or torn handlebar grips or tapes is a simple way to improve 
the appearance of your bike. You can add a different color of tape or change 
the style of grips to meet your fancy.
To replace handlebar grips or tape, turn to Chapter 15.
Waxing the frame
Another nice touch when it comes to improving the look of your bike, 
while protecting its finish and preventing rust, is to wax the frame. If you’re 
overhauling many of your bike’s components at the same time, you’ll have 
detached most of the parts from the frame, making cleaning and waxing the 
frame a simple task.
 
Although there are waxes designed specifically for higher-end paint finishes 
on more expensive bikes, car wax works just fine.
Checking your accessories
The annual maintenance check is a good time to inspect accessories for your 
bike. Verify that your emergency tool kit has everything it needs (see Chapter 
16). For example, if you’ve patched a number of flats over the year, you may 
need to buy another patch kit. If you’ve used your spare inner tube, you 
should replace it.
If you have lights on your bike, replace the batteries. Do the same for your 
onboard computer. It’s better to replace batteries now than discover that 
they don’t work when you’re caught out on the road after dark.

ne of the themes of this book is that repair and maintenance is not just 
about keeping your bike in great shape and extending its life, but also 
making sure you stay safe. Taking a couple of minutes before you ride to 
prepare for your trip and to inspect your bike will go a long way in increasing 
the odds that you and your bike return home in one piece. In this chapter, we 
cover the ten (or so) top steps you can take to reduce strain on your body 
and improve safety while your ride.
Take a Road Safety Skills Class
The League of American Bicyclists offers road-skills classes throughout the 
United States to make bicyclists aware of the hazards they face sharing the 
roadways. The classes teach you how to avoid collisions with automobiles 
and dodge road hazards. You can find a class near you at www.bikeleague.

Adjust the Handlebars
If you’re going to be spending any amount of time on your bike, you should 
try to make it as comfortable an experience as possible. You can do a number 
of things to improve the riding experience, and one of these things is to 
adjust the handlebars.
For road bikes, the old-school approach to positioning the handlebars 
was to have the handlebar ends run parallel to the top tube in the frame. 
Although being bent over like the Hunchback of Notre Dame may be good 
for aerodynamics, having your weight supported on outstretched arms is 
not very comfortable for everyday riding.
 
To position your handlebars for a more enjoyable ride, set them such that 
they leave your back at a 45-degree angle (see Figure 18-1). You may need to 
rotate the handlebars within the clamp that holds them or change or adjust 
the stem as described in Chapter 15. With the proper adjustment, you can 
ensure that the weight of your upper body will be distributed between your 
torso and your arms.

handlebar 
angle.

 Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Take Before You Ride
Another consideration for the handlebars is the position of the brake levers. 
You want to be able to squeeze the levers while your hands are resting com-
fortably on the handlebar. If you have to reach or curl your wrists to use the 
brakes, they aren’t positioned properly.
Adjust the Saddle
Just as important as adjusting the handlebars is finding the right position for 
your saddle. If your saddle is set too high or too low, you’ll lose efficiency 
as you pedal and may even cause strain or injury to your body. We can’t tell 
you how often we see people riding with an improperly positioned saddle — 
in many cases, a saddle set too low with the person’s legs in a bow-legged 
position, which causes strain on the knees.
You know that your saddle is set to the right height if you can just barely place 
your toes and the balls of your feet on the ground when you sit on the saddle (see 
Figure 18-2). Go for the maximum leg extension without locking out your knees or 
bobbing your hips in order to reach low. Pain in the back of the kneecaps results 
from seats too low; pain in the front, from seats too high. Your leg should be bent 
at a slight angle when your foot is on the pedal at its lowest position.

saddle 
height.
 

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Another adjustment you can make is the fore and aft (how far back or forward 
the seat is positioned). If your seat is too far to the rear, you’ll be stretching to 
reach the bars, which puts strain on your back and knees. (See Chapter 9 for 
how to adjust fore and aft.)
Check Tire Pressure
Before you set off for a ride, make sure you check your tire pressure. If your 
tires aren’t properly inflated, riding will be less efficient and you’ll be at 
greater risk of damaging your rims and getting flats.
When checking tire pressure, it isn’t enough to pinch the tires to feel whether 
they’re firm — tires that are under-inflated feel very similar to those with the 
proper amount of pressure. The most accurate and surefire way of checking 
tire pressure is to use a tire-pressure gauge. When filling tires with air, pump 
them to the recommended pressure listed on the sidewall of the tire.
Check the Brakes
Checking your brakes takes only a few seconds, and it can be one of the most 
important things you do before setting off on a ride.
Start by visually inspecting the brake pads for wear; confirm that there are 
still grooves cut into the pads. When these grooves wear away, it’s time to 
change the pads. Also, check to make sure that the brake pads are not rub-
bing against the wheels. There should be between 1 to 2 millimeters of space 
between the pads and the rim.
After visually inspecting the brake pads, give the brake levers a strong 
squeeze. The pads should firmly grip the wheel. (See Chapter 8 for instruc-
tions on making adjustments to the brakes.)
 
You should also be able to apply the breaks without having to pull the lever 
more than halfway back to the handlebars — any more than that, and you 
could be putting yourself in a dangerous position when it comes time to brake.
Look for Looseness
 
The rattling of components or extra movement in parts of your bike could be a 
sign that something is starting to come apart. If you ignore these signs, you 

305
 Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Take Before You Ride
could end up causing damage to your bike or find yourself on the end of a bike 
that decides to disassemble itself while you’re riding it.
To test your bike for looseness:
 
✓ Lift the front wheel up 2 to 3 inches, and drop it back down. Do the same 
to the rear wheel using the seat to lift it. Listen for anything rattling.
 
✓ Check for looseness in the stem and handlebars by putting the front 
wheel between your legs and moving the handlebars from side to side 
(see Figure 18-3).
 
Figure 18-3: 
Checking 
for loose-
ness in the 
handlebars 
and stem.
 
 
✓ Examine the rest of the frame by straddling the frame with both legs 
and trying to move the bike forward and backward while squeezing the 
brakes. If the bike moves during either of these two tests, it could indicate 
looseness. If anything shakes or rattles, it could mean that an attachment 
like a water-bottle cage or a rack for carrying panniers (bags) is loose.
 
✓ Check the crank arms by grabbing one in each hand and trying to wiggle 
them from side to side. If there is some play in the crank arms, it could 
be time for a bottom bracket adjustment.

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Check the Wheels
Take a moment to check the wheels before you depart on your next trip. 
Wheels are the only parts of the bike that are in contact with the road; ensur-
ing that they’re secure and in good working order will help ensure that you 
yourself don’t come in contact with the road.
To inspect the wheels:
 
✓ Examine the quick-release levers to confirm that they’re securely fas-
tened in the closed position. Open and close the levers once to confirm 
that they’re tight. If you find that they’re loose, open the lever, turn the 
nut opposite the lever a quarter-turn, and re-close the lever. Continue 
this procedure until properly tightened.
 
✓ Grab the frame with one hand and, with the other hand, give each wheel 
a shake from side to side to check for looseness (see Figure 18-4). There 
should little or no amount of play in the hubs. Any significant movement 
could be a sign that there is an issue with the wheel.
 
✓ While you’re grabbing the wheel, pluck its spokes. Like a string on a 
fine-tuned harp, they should respond with a consistent twang indicating 
they’re of similar tension.
 
Figure 18-4: 
Checking for 
looseness in 
the wheels.
 

307
 Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Take Before You Ride
 
✓ Lift the wheel off the ground and give it a spin to see that it doesn’t wobble 
and that the rim doesn’t contact the brake pads at any point. If the wheel 
doesn’t spin straight, it may need to be trued. Contact with the brake pads 
could also mean that the wheel isn’t properly seated in the dropouts. (See 
Chapter 7 if you have to make adjustments to your wheels.)
Grab Your Toolkit
Although the probability is that your next ride will be uneventful, don’t let 
that be a reason to hop on your bike without grabbing your toolkit. Murphy’s 
Law has a devious way of striking in the least expected moment, so don’t 
tempt fate by leaving your toolkit behind. (For more details on creating a tool 
kit and what it consists of, turn to Chapter 16.)
 
Most important for your toolkit is a patch kit to repair flats, tire levers to 
remove tires, and some Allen wrenches, screwdrivers, and spoke wrenches. 
For safety, remember to pack a rag or some moist wipes with your kit so your 
greasy hands don’t slip off the bars after a roadside repair. Plus, you won’t 
gross out your friends when you stop for a snack and have to put food in 
your mouth.
Wear Your Helmet and Gloves
Wearing a helmet is one of the smartest things you can do to improve safety 
while you bike. A stylish, light, adjustable, comfortable, and ventilated helmet 
doesn’t cost much money — and it protects your cranium (which is pretty 
much priceless).
 
If you’ve been in an accident that caused an impact to your helmet, or if 
you’ve had the helmet for more than a few years, consider replacing it. The 
helmet’s foam, which acts as a shock absorber, breaks down over time or after 
an accident and becomes less effective.
When Dennis isn’t riding, a pair of biking gloves sits inside his helmet. Gloves 
significantly reduce vibration, which comes from the bike being in contact 
with the road. Gloves may not make much difference on a short ride, but 
you’ll be thankful that your hands aren’t numb after a couple hours on your 
bike. Gloves will also protect your hands in the event of a crash when the 
instinct is to use your hands to brace a fall. Gloves come in all shapes and 
sizes; Dennis likes the comfort of those with gel in the palms.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Improve Your Visibility
We can’t emphasize enough how important it is to make yourself visible to 
others, especially if you’re going to be riding on the road. Drivers are faced 
with many distractions — cellphones, GPS devices, iPods, food, screaming 
kids — and if you blend into the background, you increase the chances that 
you’ll be on the wrong end of a close encounter with a 4,000-pound bundle of 
steel and rubber.
Here are some ways you can improve your visibility:
 
✓ Wear brightly colored clothing — even during daytime biking.
 
✓ Make sure that your wheels and pedals have reflectors.
 
✓ Use reflective arm and leg bands.
 
✓ Keep a bright white front light and a flashing LED rear light for when 
you’re caught out during dusk or for nighttime riding.
 
 Make sure you check the batteries in your lights. Although battery-pow-
ered lights are bright, they fade fast. Keep a spare set of batteries in 
your house so you never leave home without lights that work.
Stock Your Emergency Gear
Although most of your bike rides will be pleasingly uneventful, you never 
know when an emergency may strike. You can end up getting lost, having 
an accident, getting caught in a sudden storm, or becoming fatigued. Be pre-
pared for the unexpected by having an emergency pack of supplies available.
Before you head out, always fill your pannier bag with the following items:
 
✓ Your cellphone
 
✓ Identification (such as your driver’s license)
 
✓ Money
 
✓ Energy bars
 
✓ A rain jacket
 
✓ Sunglasses
 
If you don’t want to have to carry your wallet with you on your rides, check 
out RoadID (www.roadid.com), where you can buy a wrist band with your 
name and emergency-contact information printed on it, as well as a shoe 
pouch (in which you can put money, your house key, an ID, and so on). You 
can get a wrist band or a shoe pouch for about $20 each (as of this writing).

Ten Considerations 
in Fitting Your Bike
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the length of the crank arm
▶ Choosing the right gearing
▶ Paying attention to all things saddle
▶ Finding the right frame size
▶ Handling handlebars
I
n the course of maintaining and repairing your bike, you need to consider 
how any adjustments you make might affect the way your bike fits you. 
The better a bike is fitted or tailored to your body size, the more enjoyable 
your riding experience will be. A properly fitted bike leads to more efficient 
riding, more power delivered to the pedals, greater comfort, and less chance 
of soreness or injury.
When you first purchase a bike, you should work with a fit specialist at the 
bike shop to make sure that the bike you buy fits your body. But you can — 
and should — also focus on fit as you maintain and repair your bike.
 
Fit is not an exact science. Yes, there are some high-tech measurement and 
sizing machines, fitting systems, charts, and formulas. But put two experts in a 
room, and they’ll come up with a different set of measurements. Our best 
advice is to follow the basic principles and tips in this chapter and throughout 
this book and consult with your local bike shop. If you do that, you should be 
able to get a fairly good fit with your bike — and your back, shoulders, arms, 
legs, and hands will thank you for miles to come.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Considering Crank Arm Length
The crank arm determines the circumference in which the pedals rotate. The 
larger the crank arm, the larger the circumference in which you’ll be pedal-
ing. A longer crank arm gives you more leverage when you pedal. Riding with 
a longer crank arm is kind of like being in a lower gear, an important benefit if 
you’re doing a lot of climbing. On the other hand, a shorter crank arm comes 
in handy if you pedal at a high cadence (for example, if you’re racing).
 
With longer crank arms it’s important to make sure the bottom bracket has 
enough clearance. If you buy a bike with a crank arm that’s too long, the crank 
arm may hit the ground when you’re cornering.
Your height will impact the length of the crank arm you chose. In most cases, 
taller bikers should have longer crank arms, and shorter bikers should have 
shorter crank arms.
A number of different crank arm lengths are available. It’s common to see 
lengths of 165mm to 180mm in 2.5mm increments, with the most common 
lengths being 170mm and 172.5mm. If you’re in the NBA, you’ll be glad to 
know that a few manufacturers will sell you a crank of 185mm or more. Work 
with your local bike store to find the crank the best suits you.
Going for Gearing
Choosing the appropriate gearing may not be fitting a bike in the traditional 
sense, but it is an important factor in how well a bike fits the way you ride. 
By selecting a bike with the gearing that meets your fitness levels, how you 
pedal, and the terrain on which you ride, you can make a significant and posi-
tive impact on your riding experience.
Most newer bikes have seven to ten cogs in the rear and two to three 
chainrings in the front. Multiply these two numbers together and you have 
the total number of gears for your bike. If you’re in shape and you don’t 
do a lot of climbing, you’re probably fine with seven to eight cogs and two 
chainrings. Some riders like to have a third chainring in case a climb is neces-
sary or fatigue sets in at the end of a long ride (though that third chainring 
does add extra weight and three chainrings won’t shift as effortlessly as two); 
third chainrings are also useful for mountain biking and touring.
 
If you’re planning on doing a lot of mountain biking or touring, talk to your 
local bike shop to make sure you have the right gearing. They can give you 
advice not just about the total number of gears but about the size of the indi-
vidual cogs and chainrings, important factors in gearing. (For a more detailed 
discussion of gearing, turn to Chapter 2.)

 Chapter 19: Ten Considerations in Fitting Your Bike
Resisting the Temptation 
to Tilt Your Saddle
Some people are tempted to tilt the saddle downward in an attempt to find 
a more comfortable position and relieve pressure on the groin. Resist the 
temptation! The problem with this position is that it causes you to slide 
forward against the handlebars, which puts additional weight and stress on 
your arms, wrists, hands, and shoulders. In the other extreme, a saddle tilted 
upward can cause discomfort, especially for men — and we don’t need to 
explain why!
In general, we recommend that you try to keep your seat flat and parallel to 
the ground. To check the straightness of your seat, place a level on top of the 
seat, and make adjustments as necessary.
Setting the Saddle Height
Saddle height is an important factor in fitting your bike. A saddle set too 
high reduces the amount of power available for pedaling and causes you to 
stretch for the pedals on the down stroke and rock back and forth on the 
saddle, which can cause soreness. A saddle set too low doesn’t allow you to 
use your leg muscles efficiently, puts extra strain on the knees, and can lead 
to injury.
We notice many riders whose saddles are not at the proper height, some-
times significantly so. Odds are, a rider whose saddle isn’t set to the proper 
height made some adjustments over time that affected the saddle height but 
didn’t know exactly where to set it. In Chapter 18, we give you step-by-step 
instructions for choosing the proper saddle height for your bike.
 
After you’ve set the correct height for your saddle, mark the seat post with 
tape or a small score in the metal so you can easily return it to that position if 
the post comes loose or you have to remove it.
Looking at the Saddle Fore and Aft
The fore and aft are how far forward and backward the saddle is on your 
bike. If the saddle is too far forward, you lose leverage when you pedal; if it’s 
too far back, you could be putting strain on your back. As with most parts of 
the bike, the fit depends on how you’re going to be using your bike. If you’re 
racing, you’ll want to have the saddle in a more forward position along with the 

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
handlebars, which will put you in a more bent-over, aerodynamic position, and 
allow you to deliver more power to the pedals. If you’re not racing, though, the 
best position will have the saddle nose behind the bottom bracket.
To find the proper fore and aft position, sit on your bike with the pedals parallel 
to the ground while someone supports you. Hang a string with a weight tied to 
the end of it from your kneecap down past the pedal. The line from your knee-
cap should pass through the center of the pedal where the axle threads into the 
crank arm (see Figure 19-1). If the string is in front of the pedal, move the saddle 
forward. If the string is in back of the pedal, move the saddle backward.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Use a string 
to set your 
saddles 
fore and aft 
position.
 

313
 Chapter 19: Ten Considerations in Fitting Your Bike
After you make the adjustment, give your bike a test ride to make sure you 
feel comfortable. Remember that after you first change the position of the 
saddle, you may feel a little strange. Give it some time before you make a final 
decision on where it should be.
Choosing the Right Saddle Type
Unless you’re a racer competing in sprints, you’re going to be spending the 
majority of your time biking with your bum on a saddle. The saddle is one 
of the three points of contact your body has with the bike (the pedals and 
handlebars are the other two), and the saddle is where a lot of your weight is.
Some saddles are designed to support the specific anatomy of men, while 
others are designed for women, so make sure you choose the right one. 
Saddles for men are normally longer and narrower and sometimes have 
cutout sections or extra padding to help prevent numbness. For women, 
saddles are shorter and wider toward the back to better accommodate a 
woman’s wider pelvis. (Children use smaller sized saddles than adults do.) 
Figure 19-2 shows the differences between saddles for men and women.
 
Figure 19-2: 
Saddles for 
men (right) 
and women 
(left).
 
Saddles come in a variety of different materials. Leather saddles conform to 
the shape of your butt, although they require special care, especially in wet 
weather. Other saddles are made with gel or foam padding with many differ-
ent coverings that are more resistant to the elements.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You may think that a bigger, softer saddle would equal a more comfortable 
ride. Unfortunately, bigger and softer does not translate into comfort. Weight 
from your body should come into contact with the seat through two bones at 
the lower part of your pelvis. If you have a properly fitted seat, when you get 
off your bike, you should see two indentations centered on each side of your 
seat. If the seat is too soft, your entire butt is in contact with the seat caus-
ing pressure on tissue and nerves that are not designed for this. Although 
a firmer seat may cause your pelvic bones to be sore after the first ride or 
two, in the long run, you’ll find that it provides the most comfortable ride. As 
crazy as it sounds, the more you ride, the smaller the seat you’ll want.
 
For comfort, wear biking shorts, which are designed without seams in the 
crotch area — seams can chafe and rub the soft tissue in the crotch. Biking 
shorts also include extra padding or chamois, which provides extra comfort, 
wicks away moisture, and keeps bacteria at bay. Just make sure you wash 
your biking shorts after each ride. Also, don’t forget to remove your under-
wear when you wear them — the goal is to have no seams and less material to 
bunch up and cause chafing.
 
If you have problems with rubbing and chafing in the groin area, consider 
applying a skin lubricant such as Vaseline. Some lubricants, such as Chamois 
Butt’r, are designed specifically for bikers.
Sizing Up the Frame
Frame size is the most important consideration when fitting a bike. Unlike 
most other factors, the frame is one thing you can’t modify. If you end up 
with a bike that has a frame too small or too large, you won’t be able to 
adjust the saddle and handlebars enough to compensate for the improper 
dimensions. Plus, an incorrectly sized frame can be dangerous, making start-
ing, stopping, and handling more difficult.
 
When you’re shopping for a new bike or frame, let the staff at your local bike 
shop assist you. They have experience matching customers to bikes, and they 
understand the different factors that come into play when choosing a frame.
The bike-shop staff will want your inseam size. This is the length from the 
floor to the top of your crotch. They’ll take this number and subtract 10 to 12 
inches from it, based on how tall you are, which will give them an estimation 
of the frame size you need. Remember: This is just an estimation — every 
bicycle will fit a little differently, depending on the manufacturer, model, type 
of bicycle, your riding style, and so on.

315
 Chapter 19: Ten Considerations in Fitting Your Bike
Frames are generally measured from the center of the bottom bracket to the 
top of the seat tube (see Figure 19-3), although manufacturers have different 
variations of this measurement. After the bike-shop staff has a general idea 
of the frame size, they’ll have you try out various bikes with this size. To con-
firm the size, they’ll have you straddle the bike with both feet on the ground 
and the frame between your legs. In this position, there should be at least 
an inch or two of space between the top tube and your crotch, more if it’s a 
mountain bike.
 
Figure 19-3: 
How frame 
size is 
measured.
 
Focusing on Frame Dimensions
If your local bike shop determines that you need a certain size frame, they’ll 
still need to have you sit on the bike to confirm that the frame’s dimensions 
suit your body type. Two 20-inch frames can vary significantly based on the 
dimensions in which they were manufactured. A shorter version of a 20-inch 
frame will provide greater performance and handling; in this case, the seat 
tube will be more upright, requiring you to sit in a more aerodynamic, bent-
over position. Another 20-inch frame may have a longer base to provide sta-
bility and comfort and a more sloped seat-tube angle for a more upright ride, 
both of which provide benefits when touring.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
As a general rule, when you’re seated on a bike with your hands on the 
handlebars and feet on the pedals, the handlebars should block your view of 
the front hub. Another rule of thumb is that in your natural reach, your arms 
should make a 90-degree angle to your torso. On road drop handlebars, of 
the three holding positions, the middle lean (hands over brake levers) should 
obscure the hub with the handlebars.
In general, you shouldn’t be stretched out like Lance Armstrong or sitting 
upright like you’re getting a haircut. There should be a slight bend in your 
elbows and they shouldn’t be locked out or pressed into your ribs.
 
If the top tube is slightly too long or short, this can be compensated for by 
adjusting the stem length. The stem can be raised or lowered; with adjustable 
stems, the angle can be adjusted as well.
Positioning Your Handlebars
The handlebars are one of the three points where your body comes into con-
tact with your bike, so you need to take the time to set them in the position 
that’s most comfortable for you.
 
Before adjusting your handlebars, make sure you’ve found the appropriate 
height and angle for your saddle. If you don’t have the saddle in the proper 
position, you won’t be able to set the handlebars correctly.
For most everyday riders, the handlebars should be even with or slightly 
higher than the seat. When you sit on the bike and grab the uppermost 
part of the handlebars and straighten your arms, your back should be at a 
45-degree position. If you’re looking for a more aerodynamic position, the bar 
should be an inch or two lower than the saddle. In this position, the angle of 
your back will be less than 45 degrees.
The height of the handlebars is sometimes limited by the type of stem you 
have. On some threadless stems, spacers can be used to adjust the height. 
If this doesn’t provide enough of a change, you can replace the stem with an 
adjustable one that provides more range to move the handlebars.
For road bikes with dropdown handlebars, the other adjustment to con-
sider is the angle. The traditional approach was to have the bottom of the 
handlebars line up parallel to the top tube. But if you don’t want to be bent 
over in a position better left to yoga classes, a more appropriate angle is for 
the bottom of the handlebars to be closer to parallel with the seat stays, as 
shown in Figure 19-4.

Getting a Handle on Handlebar Style
Like many other parts of the bike, there are a plethora of different styles of 
handlebars on the market. You can find handlebars for road racing, mountain 
biking, touring, and everyday riding. Of these different types, two shapes are 
predominant — the drop-down road-bike style and the flat mountain-bike style.
Regardless of the style of handlebars you choose, choose a width that comes 
close to matching the width of your shoulders. This width will keep your 
arms parallel while you ride and your chest open for efficient and relaxed 
breathing.
Your hands should be in a relaxed position when you grab the brakes. Your 
wrists should not be angled down over the handlebars when squeezing the 
brakes. An awkward angle for your wrists will cause pressure on the nerves 
and lead to an uncomfortable numbing sensation in the hands and wrists.
 
Frequently change the position of your hands when you ride. One way to 
increase the number of positions for riding is to add bar-ends to your flat, 
mountain-bike-style handlebars. Not only do bar-ends give you an alternative 
position, but they can be beneficial for climbing. Just remember that your 
hands will be farther away from the brakes, which could be a problem if you 
have to stop suddenly.

Ten Ways to Improve 
the Performance and 
Comfort of Your Bike
In This Chapter
▶ Taking your bike to the next level
▶ Making all your friends jealous with your upgrades
O
ne of the joys of owning and working on a bike is the chance to upgrade 
its parts. Just like car tuning, tuning your bike can help you improve 
both comfort and performance while you ride. Odds are, doing a complete 
overhaul of your bike is probably not in your price range, especially consid-
ering that some higher-end components can be pretty pricey. But if you’re 
going to be repairing and maintaining your bike, you may want to add on 
a high-performance part once in a while. In this chapter, we present ten 
options to consider if you’re thinking about upgrading.
Upgrading Your Wheels and Tires
One way to significantly impact your bike’s performance is to upgrade the 
wheels and tires. If you can drop the weight of the wheels and tires even 
slightly, you’ll notice a definite difference when you bike.
Many options are available for upgrading your bike’s wheels. Major wheel 
manufactures offer products with a variety of rim styles made of different 
materials. Wheels are also available with an assortment of spoke designs. 
Because of the improved quality of spokes, wheels are being built with fewer 
spokes but with comparable strength and durability.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you upgrade your tires, you’ll realize another performance gain: Higher-
quality tires provide reduced weight and less rolling resistance, which makes 
a dramatic difference in performance. Better-quality tires are designed with 
more threads inside the rubber, which holds the tire together, allowing for 
greater air pressure, less contact surface, and a fast ride.
The tread pattern on the tires also has an impact on ride comfort. The less 
tread on your tires, the less rolling resistance and the better performance 
you’ll experience.
Most wheels allow you to change the width of your tires. Tire width impacts 
performance — narrower tires give you a faster ride because of their 
decreased rolling resistance, and wider tires are more comfortable because 
they absorb more road shock (although wider tires have more tread on the 
road and more rolling resistance). To determine the width of your tire, look 
at the dimension written on the sidewall of your tires; specifically, look for 
the second number. A marking of 700x25 means the tire has a circumference 
of 700cm and a width of 25cm. If you plan on changing the width of your tires, 
work with your local bike shop to make sure you find tires that work with the 
dimensions of your frame.
The other important consideration when choosing tires is durability. If you’re 
touring and riding a significant number of miles with fully-packed pannier bags, 
you’ll want a very durable tire that can handle the weight. A more durable tire 
will also lead to fewer flats along the way. Many of the tires specially designed 
for durability have a Kevlar belt or other material designed for protection.
 
If you want protection from flats but don’t have the money to upgrade your 
tires, you can fill your bike’s tubes with a puncture sealant. The liquid inside 
the tube will automatically fill any punctures that may occur. In addition to 
puncture sealant, you may want to opt for thorn-resistant tubes (which are 
thicker than normal tubes) and tire liner (a protective stripe of Kevlar that you 
place between the tire and tube). The downside to this flat protection, how-
ever, is significant added rotational weight — but if you absolutely hate flat 
tires, you won’t mind trading some performance for convenience.
Ramping Up Your Rear Derailleur
The rear derailleur is the biggest factor in shifting performance. Top-end 
derailleurs have stronger springs and tighter bushings and pivot points that 
allow for easier and faster shifting. These derailleurs are designed with jockey 
wheels with higher-end bearings, which cause less resistance and smoother 
chain movement, which, in turn, improves chain life and derailleur life.

 Chapter 20: Ten Upgrades to Improve the Performance and Comfort of Your Bike
 
Pair a top-of-the-line rear derailleur with an upgraded shifter, and you’ll multi-
ply the impact of that derailleur and find that you can change gears with 
barely a flick of the finger.
Beefing Up Your Bearings
Bearings in the wheels and bottom brackets are designed to reduce friction 
as you roll on down the road. Higher-quality bearings are made with greater 
precision and reduce friction due to their smoother surfaces and longer life. 
Many higher-end bearings are designed with rubber seals to keep contami-
nants out. The latest breakthrough in bearings are those made of ceramic, a 
material that is amazingly smooth with almost no resistance.
Pumping Up Your Pedals
Many casual riders think that clipless pedals are difficult to use and are only 
for professional riders. Unfortunately, this misconception causes a lot of 
riders to miss out on a significant performance gain. Studies have shown that 
clipless pedals can improve performance by up to 30 percent, by increas-
ing the efficiency of the pedal stroke. With clipless pedals, you don’t have 
to expend any energy keeping your foot centered on the pedal during the 
upstroke of the pedals. As a result, you can pedal in complete circles, in a 
pattern of push down, pull back, pull up, and push forward — a much more 
efficient mode of pedaling.
As for the misconception that it’s difficult to disengage clipless pedals, espe-
cially in the event of an emergency, nothing could be farther from the truth. 
After trying clipless pedals, you’ll discover that releasing your foot from the 
pedal is a very natural movement.
 
Some pedals have an adjustment for the amount of energy required to release 
the cleat and shoe from the pedal. This adjustment allows new riders to use a 
loose setting while adjusting to the pedals. Then, when they’re comfortable 
using clipless pedals, they can tighten that adjustment to allow for hard 
pedaling without the fear of releasing the clips.
 
Casual commuters who want to increase their pedal efficiency may find 
power straps and conventional toe straps useful. Also, double-sided pedals, 
which have a normal platform on one side and a clipless pedal on the other, 
are great for people who like to ride their bikes with whichever shoes they’re 
wearing at the time.

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A Shoe-In: Choosing the 
Best Shoes for the Job
Shoes are another factor in pedaling efficiency. Many everyday riders use 
running, cross-training, or basic tennis shoes when riding. These shoes are 
designed to absorb the impact from running and walking in order to improve 
comfort. But on a bicycle they absorb a lot of the energy before it gets to the 
pedals, causing your pedaling to be less efficient. On the other hand, cycling 
shoes have a very stiff sole and are designed to transfer all your energy to the 
pedals to get you down the road as efficiently as possible.
Some biking shoes are so stiff that they look like they were cast out of iron. 
Others shoes are designed with the cleat recessed up into the sole and flex-
ible materials that allow you to walk normally — these are popular with 
touring or mountain bikers, because they allow you to ride and then get off 
and walk around town or hike up an un-rideable trail. In contrast, road biking 
cleats are mounted directly to the sole and are hard to walk in. They’re 
like having high heals on, because the shoes are designed with the toes set 
higher than the heals.
 
Be careful walking in road-biking cleats — they’re very slippery on flat surfaces.
Saddle Up! Taking Your Saddle 
to the Next Level
A top-notch saddle not only can improve the comfort of your ride but 
increase your pedaling efficiency. There are many options on the market — 
enough to fit many different body types. Some saddle manufacturers even 
make a tool to measure your tail-bone position so you can get the most tai-
lored and comfortable fit. However, the only way to be sure that you’ll be 
comfortable on a saddle is to try it. Some bicycle stores have test seats to try 
out in the store; others allow you to try a seat on your own bicycle for a lim-
ited time to get a feel for it.
Upgrading Your Handlebars
Handlebars come in many different sizes and styles, so there’s no excuse 
for not finding a set that fits you. A correctly sized handlebar can greatly 
improve riding comfort. As a general rule, your handlebars should be as wide 
as your shoulders. This allows for improved breathing while you ride, while 
giving you greater control of the bike.

323
 Chapter 20: Ten Upgrades to Improve the Performance and Comfort of Your Bike
With drop bars or racing-style handlebars, you have options as to the shape. 
Some have a flat spot for your hands in the middle of a curved drop section 
to give your hands support when riding. Some have a flat platform on the top 
section of the bars to give your palms more of a surface ledge to rest on.
Also available are triathlon or aero bars, which are attachments added to the 
handlebars that have hand grips and elbow rests. They allow you to ride in a 
bent-over position with your arms and elbows tucked in close to your body 
to reduce wind resistance.
If you have flat or upright handlebars, you can add bar ends to the handle-
bars to give you another hand position. Bar ends are small 2- to 5-inch exten-
sions that mount to the end of the handlebars and drastically improve your 
comfort on longer rides, allowing you to change your body position and shift 
your weight to get more comfortable.
Boosting Your Brake Levers
Like the handlebars and other parts of the bike, brake levers come in differ-
ent sizes and styles. Some levers are designed for improved comfort with a 
larger surface area for your hands when you’re riding on the hoods (the part 
above the brake levers that serve as another place to rest your hands). Most 
bikes for women have brake levers that are smaller, with a shorter reach 
for people with smaller hands. Bicycles with flat or upright bars have brake 
levers that are adjustable for people with smaller hands as well.
The angle of the lever can also make a significant difference in comfort and 
performance. The levers should be positioned at an angle so that your hands 
rest in a natural and comfortable position.
Taking Your Clothing up a Notch
While clothing doesn’t qualify as a bike component, it is an important factor 
in improving your riding experience. Cycling shorts are made of stretch-
able material that moves with you as ride your bike. Many biking shorts 
have panels of material to hold their shape and prevent the material from 
bunching up. Shorts with eight panels are popular, but basic shorts with 
four panels will usually suffice. The chamois or crotch liner in cycling shorts 
greatly improves comfort and performance. Its design helps reduce impact 
on key pressure points and wicks away moisture. Another advantage of 
cycling shorts is the fact that you don’t wear any undergarment, which elimi-
nates extra material and eliminates seams that can cause chaffing.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you’re looking for a different look or style, try bib overalls designed for 
cyclists. Bibs are preferred by many bikers because of the increased comfort 
with the elimination of the waistband.
Biking jerseys are another must in the wardrobe of any biker. Designed with 
special fabric, they wick away perspiration and dry quickly. They fit snug 
to your body, which reduces wind resistance. And they have pockets in the 
back for easy access to your iPod or energy bar.
 
A major factor when it comes to clothing is also visibility. To safely ride on the 
road, even during the middle of the day, you need to be extremely visible. 
Wear a neon-colored windbreaker, a bright cyclist jersey, or a reflective vest.
If you commute or go on long-distance rides, wear layers: arm and leg 
warmers, windbreakers, and sometimes a base layer, and a cover layer of 
jerseys. Another extremely basic and handy clothing item is a pant-cuff tie 
or clip, to keep your pant legs from being stained by your chain if you’re 
riding in street clothes.
Embracing Your Inner Geek 
with a Cycling Computer
A cycling computer is a great addition for your bike. Most computers tell 
all sorts of interesting stats about your ride, such as how fast you’re going, 
how far you’ve gone, your average speed, your max speed, and the time of 
your ride. Some computers even give you temperature and altitude readings. 
Others allow you to download the information to a personal computer so 
that you can track your riding statistics over time.
A cycling computer is like having a personal coach along for the ride. You 
can set goals for distance and time, and then it’s off to the races. The com-
puter tracks your progress as you bike, and you may find yourself racing 
against the clock.
