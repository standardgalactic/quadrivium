From "Ask DIY"
episode ADI-206 -- More Projects Â»
This peephole will give 
you a 180-degree field 
of vision from the front 
door.

Q: I'd like to add a little more security to my home. Any quick and easy 
projects that I can do?
A: (Brad Staggs, Ask DIY Home Repair expert): You've got to install a 
peephole in the front door. That should be at the top of your home-
security project list. It costs less than 20 bucks in most cases and should 
take you about 30 minutes to install. Just follow these steps. 
Materials:
Purchased peephole
Measuring tape and pencil
Power drill 
1/8" bit
Spade bit
1.  Install the peephole at a height that's convenient for you but still 
accessible to kids -- 5' from the ground usually works well. Make a 
pencil mark at the height in the direct center of your door (measure 
first to be exact). 
2.  Put on safety eyewear and then drill the hole for the peephole in 
two steps. First, drill a pilot hole all the way through the door using 
a 1/8" drill bit (figure A). 
3.  To complete the drilling, attach a spade, or "paddle," bit to an 
electric drill. Drill only halfway through the door, using the pilot 
hole to get started ( figure B). Then shut the door and switch the 
spade bit to the other side to drill completely through. Make sure the drill is nice and level. Drill 
only half at a time to avoid having the door splinter. 
4.  Place the two parts of the peephole mechanism in the hole in the door, making sure that the 
proper piece is facing out. Thread them together and hand-tighten the connection with one of 
your arms on each side of the door.

More Questions for Brad:
Q: I'm selling my home, and I'd like to increase its value. What can I do to improve the exterior of the 
house on a budget?
A: To improve the "curb appeal" of your home and still stay on a budget, consider planting flowers 
around the walkway, painting the exterior trim, or hanging something like a porch swing -- something 
that will make people notice your house.
Q: I've heard that salting my walkways will damage them. Is this true?
A: If you leave it on there too long, salt will damage the concrete. So sweep it off as soon as you can. 
Also, look into the new mixtures out there that are designed to melt the ice without damaging your 
concrete.
Q: I have a draft coming in under my front door. What should I do?
A: You probably need to install a doorsweep at the bottom of your door. You can buy one in the 
weatherproofing section of your home store, and it screws on.
