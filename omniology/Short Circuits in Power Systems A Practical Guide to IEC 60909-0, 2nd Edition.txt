Preface
This book is the result of many years of professional activity in the area of power
supply, teaching at the VDE, as well as at the Technical Academy in Esslingen.
Every planner of electrical systems is obligated today to calculate the single-pole
or three-pole short-circuit current before and after the project management
phase. IEC 60909-0 is internationally recognized and used. This standard will
be discussed in this book on the basis of fundamental principles and technical
references, thus permitting a summary of the standard in the simplest and most
understandable way possible. The rapid development in all areas of technology is
also reﬂected in the improvement and elaboration of the regulations, in particu-
lar in regard to IEC 60909-0. Every system installed must not only be suitable for
normal operation, but must also be designed in consideration of fault conditions
and must remain undamaged following operation under normal conditions and
also following a fault condition. Electrical systems must therefore be designed
so that neither persons nor equipment are endangered. The dimensioning, cost
eﬀectiveness, and safety of these systems depend to a great extent on being able
to control short-circuit currents. With increasing power of the installation, the
importance of calculating short-circuit currents has also increased accordingly.
Short-circuit current calculation is a prerequisite for the correct dimensioning of
operational electrical equipment, controlling protective measures and stability
against short circuits in the selection of equipment. Solutions to the problems
of selectivity, back-up protection, protective equipment, and voltage drops in
electrical systems will not be dealt with in this book. The reduction factors, such
as frequency, temperatures other than the normal operating temperature, type
of wiring, and the resulting current carrying capacity of conductors and cables
will also not be dealt with here.
This book comprises the following sections:
Chapter 1 describes the most important terms and deﬁnitions, together with
relevant processes and types of short circuits.
Chapter 2 is an overview of the fault current analysis.
Chapter 3 explains the signiﬁcance, purpose, and creation of IEC 60909-0.
Chapter 4 deals with the network design of supply networks.
Chapter 5 gives an overview of the network types for low, medium and high-
voltage network.
Chapter 6 describes the systems (network types) in the low-voltage network
(IEC 60364) with the cut-oﬀconditions.

Preface
Chapter 7 illustrates the types of neutral point treatment in three-phase net-
works.
Chapter 8 discusses the impedances of the three-phase operational equipment
along with relevant data, tables, diagrams, and characteristic curves.
Chapter 9 presents the impedance corrections for generators, power substation
transformers, and distribution transformers.
Chapter 10 is concerned with the power system analysis and the method of
symmetrical components. With the exception of the three-pole short-circuit cur-
rent, all other fault currents are unsymmetrical. The calculation of these currents
is not possible in the positive-sequence system. The method of symmetrical com-
ponents is therefore described here.
Chapter 11 is devoted to the calculation of short-circuit types.
Chapter 12 discusses the contribution of high-voltage and low-voltage motors
to the short-circuit current.
Chapter 13 deals with the subject of mechanical and thermal stresses in oper-
ational equipment as a result of short-circuit currents.
Chapter 14 gives an overview of the design values for short-circuit current
strength.
Chapter 15 is devoted to the most important overcurrent protection devices,
with time–current characteristics.
Chapter 16 gives a brief overview of the procedure for calculating short-circuit
currents in DC systems.
Chapter 17 gives an introduction into power ﬂow analysis.
Chapter 18 represents a large number of examples taken from practice which
enhance the understanding of the theoretical foundations. A large number of
diagrams and tables that are required for the calculation simplify the applica-
tion of the IEC 60909 standard as well as the calculation of short-circuit currents
and therefore shorten the time necessary to carry out the planning of electrical
systems.
I am especially indebted to Dr.-Ing. Waltraud Wüst, Dr. Martin Preuss from
Wiley-VCH and Kishore Sivakolundu from SPI for critically reviewing the
manuscript and for valuable suggestions.
At this point, I would also like to express my gratitude to all those colleagues
who supported me with their ideas, criticism, suggestions, and corrections. My
heartiest appreciation is due to Wiley Press for the excellent cooperation and their
support in the publication of this book.
Furthermore, I welcome every suggestion, criticism, and idea regarding the use
of this book from those who read the book.
Finally, without the support of my family this book could never have been writ-
ten. In recognition of all the weekends and evenings I sat at the computer, I ded-
icate this book to my family.

Deﬁnitions: Methods of Calculations
The following terms and deﬁnitions correspond largely to those deﬁned in IEC
60909-0. Refer to this standard for all the terms not used in this book.
The terms short circuit and ground fault describe faults in the isolation of oper-
ational equipment, which occur when live parts are shunted out as a result.
1) Causes:
• Overtemperatures due to excessively high overcurrents;
• Disruptive discharges due to overvoltages; and
• Arcing due to moisture together with impure air, especially on insulators.
2) Eﬀects:
• Interruption of power supply;
• Destruction of system components; and
• Development of unacceptable mechanical and thermal stresses in electri-
cal operational equipment.
3) Short circuit: According to IEC 60909-0, a short circuit is the accidental or
intentional conductive connection through a relatively low resistance or
impedance between two or more points of a circuit that are normally at
diﬀerent potentials.
4) Short-circuit current: According to IEC 60909-0, a short-circuit current
results from a short circuit in an electrical network.
It is necessary to diﬀerentiate between the short-circuit current at the posi-
tion of the short circuit and the transferred short-circuit currents in the net-
work branches.
5) Initial symmetrical short-circuit current: The eﬀective value of the symmet-
rical short-circuit current at the moment at which the short circuit arises,
when the short-circuit impedance has its value from the time zero.
6) Initial symmetrical short-circuit apparent power: The short-circuit power
represents a ﬁctitious parameter. During the planning of networks, the
short-circuit power is a suitable characteristic number.

7) Peak short-circuit current: The largest possible momentary value of the short
circuit occurring.
8) Steady-state short-circuit current: Eﬀective value of the initial symmetrical
short-circuit current remaining after the decay of all transient phenomena.
9) Direct current (d.c.) aperiodic component: Average value of the upper and
lower envelope curve of the short-circuit current, which slowly decays
to zero.
10) Symmetrical breaking current: The eﬀective value of the short-circuit cur-
rent that ﬂows through the contact switch at the time of the ﬁrst contact
separation.
11) Equivalent voltage source: The voltage at the position of the short circuit,
which is transferred to the positive-sequence system as the only eﬀective
voltage and is used for the calculation of the short-circuit currents.
12) Superposition method: Considers the previous load of the network before the
occurrence of the short circuit. It is necessary to know the load ﬂow and the
setting of the transformer step switch.
13) Voltage factor: Ratio between the equivalent voltage source and the network
voltage, Un, divided by
√
3.
14) Equivalent electrical circuit: Model for the description of the network by an
equivalent circuit.
15) Far-from-generator short circuit: The value of the symmetrical alternating
current (a.c.) periodic component remains essentially constant.
16) Near-to-generator short circuit: The value of the symmetrical a.c. periodic
component does not remain constant. The synchronous machine ﬁrst deliv-
ers an initial symmetrical short-circuit current, which is more than twice the
rated current of the synchronous machine.
17) Positive-sequence short-circuit impedance: The impedance of the positive-
sequence system as seen from the position of the short circuit.
18) Negative-sequence short-circuit impedance: The impedance of the negative-
sequence system as seen from the position of the short circuit.
19) Zero-sequence short-circuit impedance: The impedance of the zero-sequence
system as seen from the position of the short circuit. Three times the value
of the neutral point to ground impedance occurs.
20) Short-circuit impedance: Impedance required for the calculation of the
short-circuit currents at the position of the short circuit.
1.1
Time Behavior of the Short-Circuit Current
Figure 1.1 shows the time behavior of the short-circuit current for the occurrence
of far-from-generator and near-to-generator short circuits.
The d.c. aperiodic component depends on the point in time at which the short
circuit occurs. For a near-to-generator short circuit, the subtransient and the
transient behaviors of the synchronous machines are important. Following the
decay of all transient phenomena, the steady state sets in.

1.2
Short-Circuit Path in the Positive-Sequence System
For the same external conductor voltages, a three-phase short circuit allows
three currents of the same magnitude to develop among the three conductors.
Therefore, it is only necessary to consider one conductor in further calculations.
Depending on the distance from the position of the short circuit from the
generator, it is necessary to consider near-to-generator and far-from-generator
short circuits separately. For far-from-generator and near-to-generator short
circuits, the short-circuit path can be represented by a mesh diagram with an
a.c. voltage source, reactances X, and resistances R (Figure 1.2). Here, X and R
replace all components such as cables, conductors, transformers, generators,
and motors.

The following diﬀerential equation can be used to describe the short-circuit
process:
ik ⋅Rk + Lk
dik
dt = ̂u ⋅sin(𝜔t + 𝜓)
(1.1)
where 𝜓is the phase angle at the point in time of the short circuit. The inho-
mogeneous ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation can be solved by determining the
homogeneous solution ik and a particular solution I′′
k .
ik = i′′
k∼+ ik−
(1.2)
The homogeneous solution, with the time constant 𝜏g = L/R, yields the
following:
ik =
−̂u
√
(R2 + X2)
et∕𝜏g sin(𝜓−𝜑k)
(1.3)
For the particular solution, we obtain the following:
i′′
k =
−̂u
√
(R2 + X2)
sin(𝜔t + 𝜓−𝜑k)
(1.4)
The total short-circuit current is composed of both the components:
ik =
−̂u
√
(R2 + X2)
[sin(𝜔t + 𝜓−𝜑k) −et∕𝜏g sin(𝜓−𝜑k)]
(1.5)
The phase angle of the short-circuit current (short-circuit angle) is then, in
accordance with the above equation,
𝜑k = 𝜓−𝜈= arctan X
R
(1.6)
Figure 1.3 shows the switching processes of the short circuit.
For the far-from-generator short circuit, the short-circuit current is, therefore,
made up of a constant a.c. periodic component and the decaying d.c. aperiodic
component. From the simpliﬁed calculations, we can now reach the following
conclusions:
1) The short-circuit current always has a decaying d.c. aperiodic component in
addition to the stationary a.c. periodic component.
2) The magnitude of the short-circuit current depends on the operating angle of
the current. It reaches a maximum at 𝛾= 90∘(purely inductive load). This case
serves as the basis for further calculations.
3) The short-circuit current is always inductive.

1.3
Classiﬁcation of Short-Circuit Types
For a three-phase short circuit, three voltages at the position of the short circuit
are zero. The conductors are loaded symmetrically. Therefore, it is suﬃcient
to calculate only in the positive-sequence system. The two-phase short-circuit
current is less than that of the three-phase short circuit, but largely close to
synchronous machines. The single-phase short-circuit current occurs most
frequently in low-voltage (LV) networks with solid grounding. The double
ground connection occurs in networks with a free neutral point or with a ground
fault neutralizer grounded system.
For the calculation of short-circuit currents, it is necessary to diﬀerentiate
between the far-from-generator and the near-to-generator cases.

Methods of Short-Circuit Calculation
The measurement or calculation of short-circuit current in LV networks on ﬁnal
circuits is very simple. In meshed and extensive power plants, the calculation is
more diﬃcult because of the short-circuit current of several partial short-circuit
currents in conductors and earth return.
The short-circuit currents in three-phase systems can be determined by three
diﬀerent calculation procedures:
1) superposition method for a deﬁned load ﬂow case;
2) calculating with the equivalent voltage source c⋅Un
√
3 at the fault location; and
3) transient calculation.
1.4.1
Superposition Method
The superposition method is an exact method for the calculation of the short-
circuit currents. The method consists of three steps. The voltage ratios and
the loading condition of the network must be known before the occurrence of
the short circuit. In the ﬁrst step, the currents, voltages, and internal voltages
for steady-state operation before onset of the short circuit are calculated
(Figure 1.5b). The calculation considers the impedances, power supply feeders,
and node loads of the active elements. In the second step, the voltage applied to
the fault location before the occurrence of the short circuit and the current dis-
tribution at the fault location are determined with a negative sign (Figure 1.5b).
This is the only voltage source in the network. The internal voltages are short-
circuited. In the third step, both the conditions are superimposed. We then
obtain a zero voltage at the fault location. The superposition of the currents also
leads to the value zero. The disadvantage of this method is that the steady-state
condition must be speciﬁed. The data for the network (eﬀective and reactive
power, node voltages, and the step settings of the transformers) are often
diﬃcult to determine. The question also arises: Which operating state leads to
the greatest short-circuit current?
The superposition method assumes that the power ﬂow is known of the net-
work before the fault inception and the setting of the tap changer of the trans-
former and the voltage set points of the generators.
By the superposition method, the power state is superimposed with an amend-
ments state before the short circuit occurs. For this condition, the consideration
of positive sequence is suﬃcient.
The network consists of i = 1,…,n load nodes and j = 1,…,m generators and
power supply applications. With a suitable program, the load ﬂow can be cal-
culated for a network condition. After the changes in the network through the
short circuit, there are other values at each node. For a three-phase short circuit,
the voltage at the fault point equals zero. This condition is also fulﬁlled when the

same voltage is given at the fault location but with an opposite voltage sign. All
network feeders, synchronous, and asynchronous machines are replaced by their
internal impedances (Figure 1.5d).
The calculation of a short-circuit current is a linear problem that can be solved
easily with linear equations. There is a linear relationship between the node volt-
ages and node currents.
With the help of nodal admittance matrix systems, linear equations can be
solved. All impedances are converted to the LV side of the transformers. In con-
trast to the load ﬂow calculation, an iteration is not required. The equations are
obtained at the short-circuit location i in matrix notation.

Equivalent Voltage Source
Figure 1.6 shows an example of the equivalent voltage source at the short-circuit
location F as the only active voltage of the system fed by a transformer with
or without an on-load tap changer. All other active voltages in the system
are short-circuited. Thus, the network feeder is represented by its internal
impedance, ZQt, transferred to the LV side of the transformer and the trans-
former by its impedance referred to the LV side. The shunt admittances of the line,
the transformer, and the nonrotating loads are not considered. The impedances
of the network feeder and the transformer are converted to the LV side.
The transformer is corrected with KT, which will be explained later.
The voltage factor c (Table 1.1) will be described brieﬂy as follows:

2) The step changes of the transformer switch
3) The loads and capacitances in the calculation of the equivalent voltage source
can be neglected
4) The subtransient behavior of generators and motors must be considered.
This method assumes the following conditions:
1) The passive loads and conductor capacitances can be neglected
2) The step setting of the transformers need not be considered
3) The excitation of the generators need not be considered
4) The time and position dependence of the previous load (loading state) of the
network need not be considered.
1.4.3
Transient Calculation
With the transient method, the individual operating equipment and, as a result,
the entire network are represented by a system of diﬀerential equations. The
calculation is very tedious. The method with the equivalent voltage source is a
simpliﬁcation relative to the other methods. Since 1988, it has been standard-
ized internationally in IEC 60909-0. The calculation is independent of a current
operational state. Therefore, in this book, the method with the equivalent voltage
source will be dealt with and discussed.

1.4.4
Calculating with Reference Variables
There are several methods for performing short-circuit calculations with abso-
lute and reference impedance values. A few methods are summarized here, and
examples are calculated for comparison. To deﬁne the relative values, there are
two possible reference variables.
For the characterization of electrotechnical relationships, we require the four
parameters:
1) voltage U in V;
2) current I in A;
3) impedance Z in Ω; and
4) apparent power S in VA.
Three methods can be used to calculate the short-circuit current:
1) The Ohm system: units – kV, kA, V, and MVA.
2) The per-unit (pu) system: this method is used predominantly for electrical
machines; all four parameters u, i, z, and s are given as per unit (unit = 1). The
reference value is 100 MVA. The two reference variables for this system are
UB and SB. Example: The reactances of a synchronous machine Xd, X′
d, and
X′′
d are given in pu or in %pu, multiplied by 100%.
3) The %/MVA system: this system is especially well suited for the quick deter-
mination of short-circuit impedances. As a formal unit, only the % symbol is
added.
1.4.4.1
The Per-Unit Analysis
Today, the power system consists of complex and complicated mesh, ring, and
radial networks with many transformers, generators, and cables. The calcula-
tion of such a circuit can be very tedious and incorrect. The use of sophisticated
computer programs is a big help for engineers. On the other hand, for a quick
calculation a simple method, per unit system also can be used. However, this
method is not accepted worldwide and is not standardized by IEC, EN, or IEEE
committees.
The pu method uses the electrical variables U, I, Z, and S. They are based on a
dimensionless same references, namely, Ubase, Ibase, Zbase, or Sbase. The resulting
dimensionless quantities are described with the lowercase u, i, z, or s.
A pu system is deﬁned as follows:
Per unit value (pu) =
the actual value (in any unit)
the base or reference value (in the same unit)
upu =
U
Ubase
A reference voltage and a reference apparent power are selected and then ref-
erence current and impedance are calculated as follows:
Zbase =
U2
base
Sbase
Ibase = Sbase
Ubase

1.4 Methods of Short-Circuit Calculation
13
Only a single global base value is selected in the short-circuit current
calculation. This reference value is then used for all other networks. The choice
of reference values can be carried out arbitrarily in principle. However, it is
appropriate to select the rated voltage at the short-circuit location as a reference
voltage. For example, as reference apparent power is the rated apparent power
of the largest transformer in the network or a power of the same selected
magnitude (e.g., 100 MVA). The best choice of base can be achieved when the
impedances and currents in easily handled orders of magnitude.
It should be noted that related parameters’ individual resources, such as the rel-
ative short-circuit voltage of a transformer ukr or related subtransient reactance
x′′
d of the generator, are always relative to a base, which consists of the design
parameters of the particular equipment. In a short-circuit current calculation as
per pu method, these parameters must ﬁrst be converted to the selected global
basis. If we give an example for voltage and current, the expression is as follows:
Upu = Uactual
Ubase
Ipu = Iactual
Ibase
Note that the voltage according to the international system of units (SI) is not
V, but U. The letter V is a unit in this case. V is used especially in Anglo-Saxon
countries.
For other values, we can write for 1 pu impedance (Ω):
Zbase = Ubase
Ibase
= Ubase
Ibase
or inpu Zpu =
Upu
Ipu
Ibase = Sbase
Ubase
We convert the values to pu:

voltage UL (Un) and ULN (U0). By deﬁnition:

1.4.4.2
The %/MVA Method
The %/MVA method can be considered as a modiﬁcation of the pu method and
designed speciﬁcally for the HV network calculation. The impedances of the
electrical equipment can be determined easily in %/MVA from the synchronous
machine and transformer characteristics. It utilizes the fact that for the pu
calculation, apparent power Sbase is completely arbitrary. Consequently, instead
of Sbase, the dimensionless value 1 is inserted. This has the result that the related
sizes of the pu are no longer dimensionless.
The related impedances can be represented in %/MVA. The %/MVA method
has the advantage that a conversion with t2 or 1/t2 eliminates the transforma-
tion of impedances in the voltage level on the transformers. Furthermore, all
impedances of resources and the dimensioning data can be obtained from the
nameplate.

Characteristics of the Short-Circuit Current
The short-circuit current is composed of two parts. The ﬁrst term describes the
a.c. (continuous current) and the second term the compensation process.
ik(t) = ̂ik ⋅sin(𝜔t −Ψ + 𝜑u) −̂ik ⋅sin(Ψ −𝜑) ⋅e−(t∕𝜏)
The size of the short-circuit current is therefore dependent on the phase angle
𝜑= arc tan X
R, the time constant 𝜏=
L
R, the time t, and the switching angle Ψ.
Thus we can obtain many shifts by changing the sizes (Figure 1.7).
Example:
RQ∕XQ = 0.176, 𝜑= −0∘, 𝜑u = −90∘,
𝜏= ∞ms, 3 ⋅𝜏= ∞ms,

Fault Current Analysis
Every electrical engineer and designer is committed to perform before and after
the project is constructed, especially the calculation of the single- or three-phase
short-circuit current in electric power systems to check the protection and
short-circuit strength of the electrical systems for the selection of equipment
and to adjust the protective devices.
This book deals with the calculation of short circuits in electrical installations
and the load ﬂow in low-voltage and high-voltage networks to the highest indus-
try standards and regulations (IEC 60909-0). The purpose of the review of funda-
mentals of power systems and short-circuit calculation by using the standards is
to obtain a better understanding of the basic complexities involved in a.c. systems.
The presentation of the regulation is maintained and summarized in a simple
and understandable way, so that the reader can do his or her job without much
trouble.
Each electrical system must be designed not only for the normal operation, but
also for abnormal conditions such as short circuits. Therefore, electrical systems
are to be dimensioned, so that neither people nor property values are jeopardized.
The design for economy and safety is strongly dependent on the calculation of
short circuits.
The knowledge of the magnitude of the short-circuit currents occurring is a
decisive factor in the design and selection of system components in electrical
power grids. The three-phase short-circuit currents cause a few exceptions to
the strongest mechanical and thermal stresses of the equipment.
The initial short-circuit current of the three-phase short circuit, I′′
k3, is the
central value of any other relevant information for the design characteristic
short-circuit current. All other short circuits can be calculated based on the
standardized factors.
For the calculation of the initial short-circuit a.c. in three-phase power systems,
there is an exact calculation using the superposition method and the other stan-
dardized method according to IEC 60909-0, the equivalent voltage source to the
short circuit at the fault location in the system.
It is assumed that there is always a perfect short circuit in both the calculation
methods (e.g., no arcing or contact resistances provided).

2 Fault Current Analysis
According to IEC 60909-0, the standardized short-circuit calculation is a
very simple method, which has the advantage of minimum data and equipment
parameters to get suﬃciently precise results.
The method calculates the maximum and minimum short-circuit currents,
irrespective of the load ﬂow condition based on standardized correction factors
for generators and transformers. On the other hand, the superposition method
requires the complete data of the system.
The load ﬂow, the voltages at all the feeds, the transformer tap positions, the
consumer loads, and so on, must be taken into consideration. However, all of
these do not necessarily lead to the maximum short-circuit current.
For the calculation of the short-circuit current, the voltage at the short-circuit
node before the occurrence of a short circuit is required. By replacing this value
with an equivalent voltage source, the short-circuit current can be determined
approximately without taking into account the power ﬂow calculation only with
the condition of reverse feed.
A reasonable assumption for the voltage source in the “reverse feed” gives the
equivalent voltage at the short-circuit location, c⋅Un
√
3 , where c is the voltage factor
and Un is the network nominal system voltage. The equivalent voltage source is
the only active voltage of the system. All network feeders and synchronous and
asynchronous motors are replaced by their internal impedances. Whereas the
network’s generators are simpliﬁed or replaced by their subtransient X′′
d that can
be found or obtained from the data sheet of the generators.
Wind turbines with a full converter (a full-scale power converter) are limited
to the rated current and do not contribute, or only marginally contribute, to the
short-circuit current. According to IEC 60909-0, asynchronous generators are
modeled by the equivalent impedance ZM.
The increasing amount of installed capacity in the high-voltage level increases
the short-circuit power in the networks, whereby higher fault currents arise. Even
the choice of neutral point treatment, as well as the network, forms a massive
inﬂuence on the protection concept.
Networks with isolated neutral or resonant-grounded phase faults in overhead
networks are usually self-extinguishing. The protection relays should not inter-
vene in this case, but only when standing shorts, as they occur in cable networks
or overhead line conductors. For these special arrangements, earth fault relays or
watt-metric relays are required.
Low-impedance grounded systems and single-phase and multiphase short
circuits are detected by the same electric protective device. Each short circuit
causes a high-fault current, which is detectable and switched oﬀselectively by
the protective device. Typically, a multiphase reclosure tries to give the chance of
self-healing and, on the other side, the network users are aﬀected by the disorder.
If it fails, short interruption is switched oﬀthree-phase.
For the protection of medium-voltage networks, which are not usually designed
as a mesh system, an independent maximum time overcurrent protection is used.
The setting of the overcurrent relay of trip factor k must be known, which links
the breaking current and the current setting. For all of these, the short-circuit
current calculation is essential.

A three-phase system can be temporarily or permanently disturbed by errors,
especially short-circuit measures or consumers. To calculate, the operating
variable computational models and algorithms are needed for solving systems
of power generation, transmission, and distribution of a comprehensive tool for
planning, design, analysis, optimization, and management of any network of
energy supply.
Due to the liberalization of energy markets and, in particular, the rapid expan-
sion of renewable energy, the demands on the network planning and management
processes are becoming increasingly complex. Complex network technologies
and network topologies are impossible today without calculation programs.
The scope of power calculations and system planning may be as follows:
• balanced and unbalanced load ﬂow calculations in coupled and meshed a.c./
d.c. systems, including any power plant and network control functions;
• short-circuit current calculation, according to IEC 60909-0, IEEE 41, ANSI
C37, G74, and IEC 61363, as well as the complete overlay method taking into
account the voltage support of inverters and multiple-error-calculating any
fault;
• fast power failure calculation with the support of parallel computing struc-
tures;
• network state estimation (as for supervisory control and data acquisition,
SCADA, applications);
• protection coordination and distance protection devices, including protection
simulation;
• arc fault calculation, according to IEEE 1584-2002 and NFPA 70E-2012;
• calculation of power quality, including harmonic load ﬂow (IEC 61000-3-6);
ﬂicker calculation, according to IEC 61400-21 and IEC 61000-4-15; and ﬁlter
sizing;
• separation points optimization in medium-voltage systems and optimization
of compensation devices;
• optimization of transformer tap changers in directional power ﬂow;
• reliability calculations, including optimal restocking strategies;
• optimal load ﬂow calculation for active and reactive power optimizations (opti-
mal power ﬂow, OPF);
• stability calculations (root mean squares (RMS)), which include power plants,
consumers, and protection devices;
• calculation of electromagnetic transient (EMT) phenomena (e.g., overvoltages
and ferroresonances by transformer saturation);
• computing eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and participation factors; and
• modeling virtual power plants.
Appropriate programs can provide the assessment and selection of electri-
cal equipment, the calculation of the mechanical and thermal short-circuit
strengths, the calculation of short-circuit currents, selectivity, and backup
protection for the selection of overcurrent protective devices, as well as the
calculation of the temperature that increases in the control cabinets.
Transformers with or without medium voltage, generators, and neutral mains
can supply the networks. A neutral power supply can be displayed by setting

the impedances of the loop impedance or short-circuit currents. Circuits can be
optionally charged to the hedging of parallel cables through a protective device,
a single hedge parallel cable with several protective devices, and dimensioned.
The chosen feeds can be connected to each other through directed or undirected
couplings. Thus, it can be explained by the resulting possibility of deﬁning the
various required operating modes (e.g., normal operation and emergency opera-
tion), represent the main supply practical and be included in the calculation.
A parallel network operation can be displayed by combining two nonsimilar
feeds via a nondirectional clutch. Feeds on the subdistribution level can also be
included in the calculation, and a presentation of separate networks is possible.
In the case of selecting a transformer with medium voltage, a medium-voltage
switchgear is required and is an important factor to size the transformer’s feeder
elements.
Transformer, generator, or neutral network in feed according to the selection
of feeder types, switchgear to the transformer or generator or neutral network
supply, which consists of a switching device, a circuit breaker, disconnector with
fuse, fuse switch disconnectors or fuse with base, cable or busbar connection
with switching device before the feed point, which stands as a type of the circuit
breaker, a circuit breaker, air circuit breakers, switch disconnectors with fuse, fuse
switch disconnectors or fuse with base to choose from.
The distributors are subdistribution, group switch, busway, busway center feed,
or distribution with equivalent impedances for selection. Concerning selecting
these elements, there are speciﬁc requirements to meet the design again (e.g.,
whether the connection line is to be performed as a busbar or as a cable and
which and how many switching devices are to be used). A cable selection section
is also provided for laying so that the inﬂuenced values of the current-carrying
capacity are taken into account in the dimensioning. The distributors are always
inserted on a busbar in the graphic. This can be the busbar, which symbolizes the
entry point, the busbar of an already connected distributor, or the representa-
tion of a current rail track so that, in this way, the network can be branched as a
radial network.
Final circuits are available as elements consumers with ﬁxed connection, socket
circuits, motors, loading units, capacitors, and dummy loads as items to choose
from. These, in turn, are connected to the busbar of existing subdistributors or the
representation of a current rail track, or directly to the entry point symbolizing
busbar. There are also various options in the placement of these elements in the
network diagram.
In practice, a selectivity detection is often required (e.g., the equipment of
emergency power supply). The switching device selection and possibly backup
protection are taken into account (e.g., the switching capacity of a downstream
switch can be increased as the upstream circuit breaker trips simultaneously
and, thereby, limits the current).
IEC 60909-0 includes a standard procedure for the calculation of short-circuit
currents in low-voltage and high-voltage networks up to 550 kV at 50 or 60 Hz [1].
The purpose of this procedure is to deﬁne a brief, general, and easy-to-handle cal-
culation procedure, which is intended to lead with suﬃcient accuracy to results
on the safe side. For this purpose, we calculate with an equivalent voltage source

at the position of the short circuit. It is also possible to use the superposition
method here.
A complete calculation of the time behavior for far-from-generator and near-
to-generator short circuits is not required here. In most cases, it is suﬃcient to
calculate the three-phase and the single-phase short-circuit currents, assuming
that for the duration of the short circuit no change takes place in the type of short
circuit, the step switch of the variable-ratio transformers is set to the principal
tapping and arc resistances can be neglected.
The short-circuit currents and short-circuit impedances can always be deter-
mined by the following methods:
• calculation by hand,
• calculation using a PC,
• using ﬁeld tests, and
• measurements on network models.
The short-circuit currents and short-circuit impedances can be measured in
low-voltage networks by measuring instruments directly at the assumed position
of the short circuit.
For the dimensioning and the choice of operational equipment and overcurrent
protective equipment, the calculation of short-circuit currents in three-phase
networks is of great importance, since the electrical systems must be designed
not only for the normal operational state, but also to withstand fault situations.
IEC 60909-0 describes the basis for calculation, which consists of the following
parts:
1) Main Part I describes the application areas and the deﬁnitions.
2) Main Part II explains the characteristics of short circuits and their currents
and the calculation method of equivalent voltage source.
3) Main Section III deals with the short-circuit impedances of electrical equip-
ment, the impedance correction factors of generators, power transformers,
and power stations.
4) Main Section IV provides the calculation of the individual short-circuit cur-
rents.
Summary of IEC 60909-0:
• Restructuring of calculations.
• The supplementary pages with examples and conversion factors supplement
the theoretical part.
• The high-voltage and low-voltage networks are treated in the same way.
• The rules for calculating the smallest and largest short circuits are equally valid
for high-voltage and low-voltage networks.
• The corrections to the impedances of generators and power plant blocks do
not depend on the time behavior of the short-circuit current.
• In low-voltage networks, a temperature rise of 20–80 ∘C is assumed for the
single-phase short circuit. This increases the resistance of the cable or con-
ductor by a factor of 1.24.
• The indices for symmetrical components (0, 1, 2) are internationally
standardized.

28
2 Fault Current Analysis
• The short-circuit currents are determined with the equivalent voltage source
method, in accordance with IEC 60909-0. For this, the internal voltages in the
network are short-circuited. The only eﬀective voltage at the position of the
short circuit is then c⋅Un
√
3 , where c is the voltage factor.
• The superposition method is the more accurate method. However, this
requires the knowledge of the network conditions before the occurrence of
the short circuit.

The Signiﬁcance of IEC 60909-0
The short circuit is an undesired network operating state. This state can cause
overloading of the operational equipment (transformers, transmission lines,
cables, and generators) as well as damage to the insulation. The transition
from normal operation to operation under fault conditions takes place through
electromagnetic and electromechanical transient phenomena, which inﬂuence
the magnitude and temporal behavior of the short-circuit currents. These
processes depend on the current sources, the position of the short circuit, and
the time from the onset of the short circuit until it decays.
The most common type of short circuit is the “dead” short circuit, that is, the
impedance at the faulty location is negligibly small. Short-circuit currents are as a
rule much larger than the load currents. The thermal and dynamic stresses result-
ing from these short circuits can destroy the operational equipment and endanger
persons. During the planning and project management of electrical systems, the
smallest short-circuit current I′′
k1min must therefore be determined and taken into
account for conﬁguring the overcurrent protection equipment and the largest
short-circuit current I′′
k3max for dimensioning the operational equipment. Only in
this way can electrical systems be correctly dimensioned and protected, allowing
their safe and economic operation. Otherwise, unpleasant consequences can be
expected. A few of these are listed below:
• impairment of safety and reliability of the power supply
• interruption of the power supply
• destruction of system components
• emergence of mechanical and thermal stresses in the operational electrical
equipment
• emergence of overvoltages.
Until 1962, VDE 0670 switchgear regulations were the standard for short-
circuit calculations. VDE 0102 was released in 1971 and revised in 1975, so
that in Germany the calculations for low-voltage and high-voltage networks
were made uniform. In the meantime, further developments in electrical power
systems have taken place and various software has appeared on the market.
In order to meet the requirements and developments, in 1985 both parts,

3 The Signiﬁcance of IEC 60909-0
“Calculation of Three-Phase Networks” in accordance with DIN VDE 0102,
were extended to include the newly summarized information about operational
equipment.
In 1988, based on this draft version, the IEC publication “Short Circuit Current
Calculation in Three-Phase AC Systems” appeared. In 1990, the present standard
IEC 60909-0 “Calculation of Short Circuit Currents in Three-Phase Networks”
was released.
The method of symmetrical components is used for both symmetrical and
asymmetrical short circuits. The capacitances of conductors and the shunt
admittances of passive loads are neglected here. In this method, motors are
treated as generators in high-voltage networks and are neglected in low-voltage
networks. For a double ground connection, only the voltage of the short-circuit
current source is used as the eﬀective voltage.
For the assessment of electrical systems, such as breaking conditions, protec-
tive measures, thermal and mechanical short-circuit strengths, selectivity, and
voltage drop, comprehensive calculations are performed.
For the calculation of short circuits, the following are important:
• power draw and documentation of result
• short-circuit currents
• transferred short-circuit currents
• impedance protection, maximum current-dependent time relays, and
current-independent time relays
• examination of breaking conditions
• proof of stability of switchgear, switching devices, cables, and conductors
against short circuits.
Figure 3.1 makes clear the importance and the range of applicability of
short-circuit current calculations and additional calculations relating to other
regulations.
In medium-voltage networks, the type of the smallest fault current that must
be considered depends on the type of neutral point design. This is decisive for the
type of network protection required.
The maximum calculated short-circuit current (I′′
k3) is responsible for the selec-
tion and rating of equipment regarding the mechanical and thermal stresses and
the determination of the time–current coordination of protective relays. The sys-
tem remains symmetrical. The balanced three-phase short-circuit current can be
performed using a single-phase equivalent voltage source method that has only
line-to-neutral voltage and impedance in positive-sequence components.
The minimum short-circuit current (I′′
k1) has to be calculated for the selection
of the system protection. According to the IEC 60364-4-41, a protective device
interrupts the supply to the line conductor in the event of a fault between the
line conductor and an exposed-conductive-part or a protective conductor in the
circuit within the disconnection time required.
Table 3.1 provides an overview of the design criteria and short-circuit current
according to IEC 60909-0, which are considered for the planning and design of
electrical power systems.

Supply Networks
All electrical appliances that are used in household and commercial and
industrial applications work with low voltage. High voltage is used not only
for the transmission of electrical energy over very large distances, but also for
regional distribution to the load centers. According to international rules, there
are only two voltage levels:
• Low voltage: up to and including 1 kV a.c. (or 1500 V d.c.)
• High voltage: >1 kV a.c. (or 1500 V d.c.).
However, as diﬀerent high-voltage levels are used for transmission and
regional distribution and because the tasks and requirements of the switchgear
and substations are also very diﬀerent, the term medium voltage has come to
be used for the voltages required for regional power distribution that are part
of the high-voltage range from 1 kV a.c. up to and including 52 kV a.c. Most
operating voltages in medium-voltage systems are in the 3–40.5 kV a.c. range.
The electrical transmission and distribution systems connect power plants and
electricity consumer and consist of (Figure 4.1) the following:
• Power plants, for generators and station supply systems.
• Transformer substations of the primary distribution level (public supply sys-
tems or systems of large industrial companies), in which power supplied from
the high-voltage system is transformed to medium voltage.
• Local supply, transformer, or customer transfer substations for large con-
sumers (secondary distribution level), in which the power is transformed from
medium to low voltage and distributed to the consumer.
The following stages of calculating and dimensioning circuits and equip-
ment are of a great interest. They can be worked out eﬃciently using modern
dimensioning tools, so that there is more freedom left for the creative planning
stage of ﬁnding conceptual solutions.
Concept ﬁnding:
• analysis of the supply task
• selection of the network conﬁguration

4.2
Lines Supplied from a Single Source
All consumers are centrally supplied from one power source. Each connecting
line has an unambiguous direction of energy ﬂow. A feed-in supplies any number
of distributed loads along the line (e.g., bus distributor, Figure 4.2).
Characteristics of this input:
• No security of supply
• High network losses.
4.3
Radial Networks
All consumers are centrally supplied from two to n power sources. They are rated
as such that each of it is capable of supplying all consumers directly connected
to the main power distribution system (stand-alone operation with open cou-
plings). If one power source fails, the remaining sources of supply can also supply
some consumers connected to the other power source. In this case, any other con-
sumer must be disconnected (load shedding). A feed-in supplies a large number
of branched lines (e.g., industrial network, Figure 4.3). As with the simple line-fed,
all consumers are switched oﬀafter the fault.
Characteristics of this input:
1) Advantages
• Very clearly arranged
• Simple network protection
• Easily calculated.
2) Disadvantages
• Single source supply
• Low security of supply
• Poor voltage stabilization
• High voltage drop.

Ring Networks
The ring network is usually fed from two sources (e.g., industrial network,
Figure 4.4). After shutdown of the error, the network can be put back into

circuit occurs, the power may be fed from both sides while the aﬀected line on
both sides will be unlocked.
Ring system in an interconnected network individual radial systems, in
which the connected consumers are centrally supplied by one power source, is
additionally coupled electrically with other radial systems by means of coupling
connections. All couplings are normally closed.
Characteristics of this input:
1) Advantages
• Increased voltage security
• Better load balancing
• Better voltage stability
• Very high voltage quality.
2) Disadvantages
• Network protection diﬃcult.
4.5
Meshed Networks
Radial system with power distribution via busbars. In this special case of radial
systems that can be operated in an interconnected network, busbar trunking sys-
tems are used instead of cables. The supply of each load is ensured by the linking
of several supply lines and in part by several feed-ins. The failure of one line or
one feed-in can normally be compensated by the remaining part of the network
(e.g., computer centers and chemical industry, Figure 4.5).

Network Types for the Calculation of Short-Circuit Currents
5.1
Low-Voltage Network Types
In this section other types of networks are shown, which are sometimes
encountered in practice and in which the short-circuit currents are fed from
diﬀerent sources. The most frequently found network types in the public and
the industrial sectors are radial networks. For these networks, the calculation of
short-circuit currents is very simple. The medium-voltage and low-voltage sides
can be conﬁgured arbitrarily, according to the requirements for supplying power
(Figure 5.1).
In industrial networks, power supply to the systems must not fail. In the
event of a malfunction, switchover can take place from another transformer
(Figure 5.2). Radial networks with redundant inputs have a higher security
of supply and a high voltage quality (Figure 5.3). The transformers can be
loaded uniformly. The meshed network with diﬀerent inputs is the most widely
used network type for electrical distribution in the industry (Figure 5.4). The
disadvantages of such networks are high costs of investment and an arrangement
that is diﬃcult to oversee.
5.2
Medium-Voltage Network Types
For optimum design of medium-voltage systems, the following points that are
not explained in further detail are of great importance:
• Network losses
• Complexity of maintenance
• Investment costs
• Power requirement coverage
• Security of supply
• Ease of operation
• Environmental compatibility.
Figure 5.5 illustrates an industrial load center network that supplies individual
large-scale loads and Figure 5.6 a ring network, in which the supply of power is
ensured.

5.3
High-Voltage Network Types
High-voltage substations are points in the power system where power can be
pooled from generating sources, distributed and transformed, and delivered to
the load points. Substations are interconnected with each other, so that the power
system becomes a meshed network. This increases the reliability of the power
supply system by providing alternate paths for ﬂow of power to take care of any
contingency, so that power delivery to the loads is maintained and the generators
do not face any outage.
The high-voltage substation is a critical component in the power system, and
the reliability of the power system depends upon the substation. Therefore, the
circuit conﬁguration of the high-voltage substation has to be selected carefully
and designed. Busbars are that part of the substation where all the power is con-
centrated from the incoming feeders and distributed to the outgoing feeders.

That means that the reliability of any high-voltage substation depends on the
reliability of the busbars present in the power system. An outage of any busbar
can have dramatic eﬀects on the power system. An outage of a busbar leads to
the outage of the transmission lines connected to it.
As a result, the power ﬂow shifts to the surviving healthy lines that are now
carrying more power than they are capable of. This leads to tripping of these lines,
and the cascading eﬀect goes on until there is a blackout or similar situation. The
importance of busbar reliability should be kept in mind when taking a look at the
diﬀerent busbar systems that are prevalent.
The three-phase high-voltage systems are found in the combined operation,
in cities and in industrial centers. The voltage level is determined by the trans-
mission and short-circuit power. The switchgear is designed as interior room or
outdoor switchyard. For the conﬁguration and calculation of switchgear of the
scope of the system and the number of the busbars and their equipment is very
important.
Figures 5.10–5.12 show diﬀerent types of high-voltage power systems such as
generation, transmission, and distribution.

Systems up to 1 kV
In low-voltage power system, the power supply systems according to the type
of connection to earth are described in IEC 60364-1 and NEC 250. The type of
connection to earth must be selected carefully for the low-voltage network, as
it has a major impact on the expense required for protective measures. Earthing
(grounding) inﬂuences the system’s electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).
In a TN system, in the event of a short circuit to an exposed conductive part,
a considerable part of the single-phase short-circuit current is not fed back to
the power source via a connection to earth but via the protective conductor (PE).
The comparatively high single-phase short-circuit current allows for the use of
simple protective devices such as fuses or miniature circuit breakers, which trip
in the event of a fault within the permissible tripping time.
TN systems are preferably used today in low-voltage networks. When using
a TN-S system, residual currents in the building and thus an electromagnetic
interference by galvanic coupling can be prevented in normal operation because
the operating currents ﬂow back exclusively via the separately laid isolated N
conductor. In the case of a central arrangement of the power sources, we always
recommend the TN system as a rule. In that, the system earthing is implemented
at one central earthing point (CEP), for example, in the low-voltage main dis-
tribution system, for all sources. If a PEN conductor is used, it is to be insulated
over its entire course – this includes the distribution system.
The magnitude of the single-phase short-circuit current directly depends
on the position of the CEP. Four-phase switches must be used if two TN-S
subsystems are connected to each other. In TN-S systems, only one earthing
bridge may be active. Therefore, it is not permitted that two earthing bridges be
interconnected via two conductors.
Today, networks with Terra–Terra (TT) systems are only used in rural supply
areas and in a few countries. In this context, the stipulated independence of the
earthing systems must be observed. Networks with an IT system are preferably
used for rooms with medical applications in accordance with IEC 60364-7-710
in hospitals and in production, where no supply interruption is to take place
upon the ﬁrst fault, for example, in the cable and optical waveguide production.

6 Systems up to 1 kV
The TT system as well as the IT system requires the use of residual current
protective devices (RCDs) for almost all circuits [4].
Earthing systems are classiﬁed according to the type of ground connection of
the power source (input type) and the type of exposed conductive parts of the
electrical system (IEC 60364 part 41). In this chapter, the three diﬀerent types of
systems and protective measures are brieﬂy described.
6.1
TN Systems
According to IEC 60364, the TN system is preferred not only in the area of
public low-voltage networks but also in the industrial sector. In TN systems, the
grounding of the operational equipment is implemented by connection to the
PEN conductor or for small cross-sections to the protective ground conductor
(PE) (Figure 6.1).

6.2 Calculation of Fault Currents

Requirements on fault protection in case of short circuit:
• All equipment must be connected to a PE.
• For distribution circuits, a turn-oﬀtime not longer than 5 s is allowed.
• For ﬁnal circuits, an RCD/30 mA must be provided.
Permissible overcurrent protective equipment for TN systems are as follows:
• Fuses
• Line protection circuit breakers (B or C type)
• Circuit breakers
• RCDs
• Arc fault circuit interrupter.
The following conditions must be satisﬁed for the ground loop impedance:
ZS ≤U0
Ia
(6.1)
where ZS is the sum of impedances of network feed-ins and power source (loop
resistance), U0 is the conductor-to-ground voltage, and Ia is the breaking current
of the overcurrent protective equipment.
The loop impedance of the TN system is required in order to calculate the min-
imum required fault current at the position of the short circuit (Figure 6.2).
6.2
Calculation of Fault Currents
This section presents and explains the simple fundamental considerations for the
calculation of the fault current.
In TN systems, the fault current is calculated in order to ensure protection in
case of indirect contact and to guarantee that the protective equipment switches
oﬀwithin the speciﬁed time. Figure 6.3 gives an overview of the calculations car-
ried out here.

TT systems
In TT systems, the neutral conductor does not serve a protective ground
conductor function. The connection of the operational equipment takes place
through the protective ground conductor to a common grounding system
(Figure 6.4). TT systems are of no importance in the industrial sector.

6.4
IT Systems
The power source for IT systems is isolated. Its application is primarily in the
industrial sector and in the operation rooms of hospitals (Figure 6.5). The source
may be connected to earth through very high impedance. The neutral conductor
may or may not be distributed in the installation.

through an impedance (indirect grounding).

source.
The protection for indirect contact is implemented by messages generated in
the isolation monitoring, with equipotential bonding or cut oﬀin addition in case
of a double fault.
Permissible overcurrent protective equipment for IT systems are as follows:
• Insulation monitoring
• RCDs
• Line protection circuit breakers
• Circuit breakers
• Fuses.

ﬁrst error with a very low impedance between a conductor and an exposed
conductive part.
The value of Id takes into account the leakage currents and the total impedance
of the electrical system and ground.

Transformation of the Network Types Described
to Equivalent Circuit Diagrams
There are many possible arrangements of networks. In order to calculate the total
impedance at the position of the short circuit, the network topologies in multiple
and meshed networks are simpliﬁed and transformed in a star–delta or delta–star
transformation (Figure 6.6).
With this approach, the network is reduced to a network with simple inputs.
The entire short-circuit path is represented by resistances and reactances and the
impedance at the position of the short circuit calculated from these. The following
relationships then apply:
The impedance is generally:
Z = R + jX

The magnitude of the impedance is given by:

For a miniature circuit breaker, the disconnection current is 5 ⋅16A = 80A.
The disconnection time is 0.4 s. The fault current is as follows :
IF = 230V
1.93Ω = 119.17A
Fault current must be greater than the disconnection current which is
IF > Ia →119.17A > 80A
With this current, the shutdown condition is satisﬁed.

Neutral Point Treatment in Three-Phase Networks
The main faults are the single-phase short circuit and the short circuit to ground.
The short circuit to ground is a conductive connection between a point in the
network belonging to the operational circuit and ground. Between 80% and 90%
of all faults in grounded networks are short circuits to ground. If the short-circuit
currents are identical in all three conductors with a three-phase short circuit,
then the fault is symmetrical. In all other cases, the fault currents in the three
conductors are diﬀerent and these faults are then asymmetrical. In addition, in
three-phase networks various so-called transverse faults are possible. Along with
these transverse faults, line interruptions can also occur.
This results in longitudinal faults, which are, however, of no importance for
short-circuit current calculations. For ground faults and short circuits to ground,
the magnitude of the short-circuit current depends primarily on how the neutral
point of the network (transformer) is connected to the ground [2]. Figure 7.1
shows an example of earthing (grounding) of possible transformer at the star
point in electrical power systems.
The short-circuit currents are determined by the voltage sources present in the
network (generators and motors) and by the network impedances. The require-
ment of an optimum and inexpensive network can lead to diﬀerent neutral point
treatments. The expense for grounding systems, network protection, network
design, operating mode, and size of the network is the determining factor in the
choice of neutral point treatment. The neutral point treatment also aﬀects the
following parameters (Figure 7.2):
• Touch, step, and grounding electrode voltages
• Single-phase short-circuit currents
• Voltage stress.
For the construction and operation of electrical systems, a knowledge of the
grounding measures is indispensable. The most important measure is protec-
tion in the event of indirect touching, that is, the safety of human beings and of
objects must be ensured. For this, the calculation of the ground potential rise is
important. This value characterizes the maximum touch voltage. Thus, in terms
of danger to human beings, the touch voltage at which a fault current can ﬂow

through the body and the heart is especially critical. The touch voltage is part of
the ground potential rise in the event of a fault, which can be picked up by human
beings. The highest touch voltage that may remain without any limit in time in
low-voltage systems is 50 V for a.c. voltages and 120 V for d.c. voltages. As stated
in EN 50522, the highest touch voltage for times greater than 5 s in high-voltage
systems is 75 V. The magnitude of the permissible touch voltage depends on the
duration of the fault and is given in Figure 4 of EN 50522. If the ground potential
rise remains less than 150 V, then the condition is satisﬁed and no further mea-
sures are required. Otherwise, additional measures have to be undertaken. For
a fault with contact to ground, the type of neutral point grounding determines
the magnitude of the line-to-ground voltage and the magnitude of the currents
ﬂowing to ground. This section will brieﬂy discuss the principles of grounding
systems and then deal with the diﬀerent methods of neutral point grounding in
high-voltage networks.

Neutral Point Treatment in Three-Phase Networks
61
The project planner has to determine and observe the following parameters for
the dimensioning of grounding systems:
1) Magnitude of the fault current (this parameter depends on the neutral point
grounding of the high-voltage network. See Table 7.1).
2) Duration of the fault (this parameter depends on the neutral point grounding
of the high-voltage network).
3) Characteristics of ground (measurement of the ground resistivity).
4) Ground resistance.
5) Correct choice and dimensioning of materials.
The design of grounding systems must satisfy four requirements:
1) The mechanical strength and resistance to corrosion of the grounding elec-
trode and protective conductor, as well as their connections, must be ensured.
These determine the minimum dimensions for the grounding electrodes.
2) The greatest fault current must be calculated and held under control from the
thermal point of view.
3) Damage to objects and operational equipment (especially information tech-
nology) must be avoided.
4) The safety of persons with respect to voltages on grounding systems (touch
voltages and parasitic voltages), which occur at the time of the greatest ground
fault current, must be ensured.
The ground potential rises and touch voltages of a grounding system can be
calculated from known data. The fault current frequently divides in the system.
For the calculation of the grounding system parameters, it is necessary to consider
all grounding electrodes and other grounding systems. In accordance with EN
50522, for step voltages, it is not necessary to deﬁne permissible values. If a system
satisﬁes the requirements with regard to the touch voltages, then no dangerous
step voltages can occur.
Overhead ground wires from overhead lines and metal shielding of ground-
ing cables are involved in leading away fault currents that ﬂow to ground. They
assume a part of the ground fault current from the particular circuit. This eﬀect
gives rise to the eﬀective relieving of a high-voltage grounding system that is
aﬀected by a ground fault. The extent of this relief is described by the reduction
factor.
The reduction factor r for an overhead ground wire in a three-phase current
conductor is as follows:

ground are small in this case and in small networks are usually self-quenching,
although large transient overvoltages can occur. The potential of the neutral point
relative to ground is determined by the capacitances CE. The short-circuit current
to ground ICE at the position of the short circuit is given by:
ICE = 3•𝜔•CE
c•Un
√
3
(7.1)
The short-circuit current to ground increases with the length of the conductor,
so that the operation of this type of network is restricted to smaller networks
(up to 30 kV). The limiting value of the short-circuit current to ground is around
35 A, since otherwise the arcing is no longer self-quenching.
Table 7.2 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of isolated networks.
7.2
Networks with Grounding Compensation
A network with grounding compensation is present when the neutral point
is grounded through ground fault coils in such a way that their inductance is
matched to the capacitance to ground (Figure 7.4). For the matching condition
IC = IL:
IC = 3•𝜔•CE

and
IL =

(7.2)
Here, we refer to the ground fault current IF as the unbalanced residual cur-
rent. The capacitive short circuit to ground IC is compensated by the inductive
coil current IL of the ground fault quenching coils apart from a residual current. If
the short-circuit current to ground exceeds 35 A, then the network must be oper-
ated with grounding compensation. The residual current should not exceed 60 A
for medium-voltage networks and 130 A for high-voltage networks, in order to
ensure the self-quenching of the arcing and to keep the thermal stress under con-
trol. If this is not the case, then low-impedance neutral point grounding must be
used. Here too, overvoltages occur as for networks with an isolated free neutral
point.

Networks with Low-Impedance Neutral Point
Treatment
In accordance with HD 63751, a network with low-impedance neutral point
grounding (Figure 7.5) is present only when the neutral point of one or more
transformers is directly grounded and the network protection is designed so that
in the event of a short circuit to ground at any arbitrary fault position automatic
cut oﬀmust take place (protection by cut oﬀ).
The fault to ground is described as a short circuit to ground and the fault
current as short-circuit current to ground or single-phase short-circuit current.
The short-circuit currents to ground are, however, limited by the neutral point
impedance (ZS = 20,…, 60 Ω) to values less than 5 kA. The ground fault factor

Impedances of Three-Phase Operational Equipment
For the calculation of short-circuit currents, it is necessary to know conductor-
speciﬁc equivalent data and impedances of electrical operational equipment,
which are usually given by the respective manufacturer. The calculation of
short-circuit currents is based on the use of equivalent circuits for the oper-
ational equipment. In principle, the equivalent resistances and reactances
must be determined for all equipment. The impedances of generators, network
transformers, and power plant blocks should take account of the impedance cor-
rections for calculating the short-circuit currents. For generators, transformers,
and choke coils, the impedances and reactances are given in the per unit (pu) or
in the %/MVA system. Cables and lines are, however, assigned Ω/km values. The
impedances of operational equipment are described in detail in the following
section [1].
8.1
Network Feed-Ins, Primary Service Feeder
The input is from a network, usually designated “Q” for source, and not from a
generator. The calculation of this network is performed with the initial symmet-
rical short-circuit power, S′′
kQ, or the initial symmetrical short-circuit current,
I′′
kQ, at the feeder connection point Q should be determined without transformer
(Figure 8.1a) and with transformer on the low-voltage (LV) side (Figure 8.1b).
The internal impedance of a high-voltage (HV) network or a medium-voltage
(MV) network can then be determined according to the following equation:

one diﬀerentiates between equipment inner-phase and outer-phase machines. In
the outer phase, the armature winding is in the rotor, wherein the inner machines
are located in the stator.
Outer-phase machines can only be operated with small power, because with
them the net power must be removed via slip rings. Inner-phase machines need
much smaller excitation power to be transferred to the rotor. Finally, there are
slip-ring inner-phase machines in which the magnetic excitation power is trans-
mitted to the rotor. The exciter ﬁeld winding is a d.c. coil. The armature winding
is performed in one or three phases. The damper windings are short-circuit
windings that are intended to calm the nonstationary processes. After the
execution of the rotor, one distinguishes further between turbo generators and
salient-phase generators.
The rotor of a turbo generator is also referred to as an inducer and is designed
cylindrically. The excitation winding will be introduced into the grooves, which
are distributed over almost the entire circumference. The rotor of a salient-phase
generator consists of individual phases and is, therefore, also called magnet
wheel.
Figure 8.2 shows a turbo generator and a salient-phase generator.

The knowledge of the short-circuit operation is important for the under-
standing of the generator behavior at all sudden disturbances of the stationary
operation (Figure 8.3).
During the nonstationary operation, the stator winding reacts on the exciter
and damper winding. In this case, a wide variety of operations occur. Before
fault inception, only the excitation ﬁeld is present. This ﬁeld forms a constant
ﬂux linkage for the excitation and damper winding and for the stator coil, a
sinusoidal alternating ux linkage, which induces the rotor voltage.
No voltage arises in the exciter and damper winding during stationary
operation. In dynamic processes, such as short circuits, the behavior of the
generator is determined by the transition reactance. Sudden short circuits
have an equalization process result in which the magnetic ux, which is caused
by the ow of the armature reaction, largely closes via magnetic stray paths in
the air. The magnetic ﬂux is distributed in diﬀerent time intervals to diﬀerent
dispersions. In A compensating current occurs in the excitation ﬁeld coil, which
also temporarily urges the stator ﬂux. The magnetic resistance is large at the
beginning of this process, which is called the transient process, but decreases
continuously until a stationary state occurs again. A similar behavior is also
exhibited by a transient reactance X′
d. It is at the beginning of the equalization
process and is much smaller than the synchronous reactance Xd. The reactance
Xd occurs continually greater during the transient event, and if it is a stationary
state, Xd becomes eﬀective again. The reactance X′
d substantially includes the
leakage reactance of the stator and rotor windings. The synchronous machine
is the main power generator in the electric power generation and is, therefore,
mainly used as a generator. Figure 8.4 shows an equivalent circuit and phasor
diagram of the synchronous machine in the positive sequence in the longitudinal
direction (d-direction) with reactances and their eﬀective internal voltages.
For three-phase short circuit, only the two inductive reactances Xh and X𝜎

occur. The amount of short-circuit current, therefore, depends only on this
reactance. At ﬁrst, the largest peak short-circuits current, which then decays to
a steady-state short-circuit current. The d.c. component occurs unchanged and
decays with constant time. The altered magnetic conditions in various parts of
the rotor voltages are induced, which in turn react on the stator. The currents in
the damper winding subside quickly, as the eﬀective resistances are very large.
These operations are called subtransient (fast transient).

This relationship describes the subtransient part, the transient part, the

The course of time can be calculated for the dimensioning of the generator and
all devices located in the short circuit and the peak short-circuit current ip, which
is important for the dynamic stress, the breaking current ia, which is decisive for
the dimensioning of the switch, and the short-circuit current Ik, the basis, for the
thermal stress of resources.

For the three-phase short-circuit current:

In the following section, a generator near a short circuit will be described. These
currents are mainly caused by the reactance of the synchronous generators (SGs).
The impedance of the SG is compared with the relatively large line impedance
so that the severity of the current is heavily inﬂuenced by the generator. The
reactance is described by diﬀerent phases and is discussed in more detail later.
The reactance increases with each phase so that very high short-circuit currents
occur, but it will soon disappear.
The impedances are dependent on the machine’s operating conditions and are
based on evaluating the envelope of the maximum values of the generator’s actual
time-dependent short circuit. This envelope is a function of power, impedances
and voltages.
For normal operations, three functions will be calculated from this envelope.
The subtransient reactance, X′′
d , determines the level of the short-circuit current
I′′
kd and the transient reactance, X′
d, determines the level of the short-circuit cur-
rent I′
kd and is called a breaking current.
Finally, the compensation process proceeds in the short-circuit current Ikd. The
more distant a short circuit occurs from the generator, the less pronounced the
three stages are.
As described below, the short-circuit current contains both a.c. and d.c.
components.

based on the behavior of SGs when the short circuit occurs, does not deal with
mathematical functions and their instantaneous values, but only with eﬀective
values, the speciﬁc be assigned to typical time ranges of the short-circuit current.
The following assumptions can be made to simplify the system calculations that
lead to conservative results. These assumptions are as follows:

1) Stator resistance is ignored. The error is negligible.
2) Preload conditions are ignored. This gives a lower value of 10%.

Transformers
To transport the electrical energy from the generator (power plant) to the end
user (households, industry, and public institutions), a chain of diﬀerent electrical
installations is needed. The last element before the consumer is usually the dis-
tribution transformer. A transformer is an alternator – an alternating voltage and
current, electromagnetic by induction, that is between two or more windings at
the same frequency. It transmits diﬀerent values of voltage and current. Thus, it
is a device for the transmission and transport of electrical energy (Figure 8.7).
At this point, it is useful to explain the transformer and its equivalent circuit
for the case of a short circuit (Figure 8.8).
The short-circuit voltage, Uk, is the primary voltage at which a transformer
with short-circuited secondary winding already takes up its primary rated cur-
rent. Uk is usually expressed as a relative short-circuit voltage in percent of the
primary voltage. It is a measure for the loading of the voltage change occurring.
The following condition applies
uk = Uk ⋅100%
UnHV
(8.7)
When a short circuit occurs during the operation of a transformer on the sec-
ondary side, the peak short-circuit current, ip, ﬂows ﬁrst, which then gradually
decays to the steady-state short-circuit current. The magnitude of ip depends on
the momentary value of the voltage and the magnetic state of the iron core. The

The equivalent circuit of the positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and zero-

8.3.2
Voltage-Regulating Transformers
For the compensation of voltage ﬂuctuations in networks, the windings of
transformers are provided with a tap so that the transformation ratios can be
adjusted to keep the voltage for certain sections constant. Voltage-regulating
transformers can be divided into two groups: controllable power transformers
and series-regulating transformers. Controllable transformers have several taps
on the voltage side to be regulated with which the transformation ratio can be
increased or decreased in the same proportions, usually in steps of 1% or 2%.
This is also known as in-phase voltage control since only the magnitude of
the voltage is regulated. Voltage regulation takes place stepwise with a switching
device, which can be described as a stepping switch or stepping switch device.
Switchover between the steps must take place under load, since load-dependent
voltage ﬂuctuations are regulated during operation.
The transformation ratio of the transformers is determined from the rated volt-
ages. With stepping switches, it is possible to match the transformation ratio to

In addition to maintaining constant voltage levels, regulating transformers are
used for controlling the load ﬂow. They too can be switched under load. These can
be divided into quadrature control transformers and phase angle control trans-
formers. For quadrature control transformers, an additional voltage is generated,
which is phase-shifted by 90∘from the voltage of a conductor. The additional
voltage is added to the side on which the voltage is regulated. Phase angle control
transformers are a combination of quadrature control transformers and in-phase
control transformers. Stepping regulators are implemented via power electronic
components, which are fast and require little maintenance. The most important
features of HV transformers are tabulated in Table 8.2.

Asynchronous Machines
Motors are energy converters, which convert the electric power into mechanical
energy in the form of linear or rotary movement. The asynchronous motor is the
most commonly used engine in plant engineering. It has a simple design and is
robust and economical (Figure 8.15).
Asynchronous motors (Figure 8.16) have ﬁled conditions similar to those of
synchronous motors following a short circuit across the terminal.

Consideration of Capacitors and Nonrotating Loads
The short-circuit currents are determined with the aid of the equivalent volt-
age source. The load ﬂow before the occurrence of the short circuit, the capac-
itances of the conductors, the passive loads, the position of the step switch of
transformers, and the state of the exciter of the generators are not considered.
Independently of the point in time at which the short circuit occurs, the discharge
current of the parallel capacitors can be neglected for the calculation of ip. The
inﬂuence of the series capacitors can also be neglected if these are provided with
voltage-limiting systems connected in parallel, which respond in the event of a
short circuit.
8.8
Static Converters
For the calculation of short-circuit currents, static converters are treated simi-
larly to asynchronous motors. Reversing mechanisms supplied from a static con-
verter contribute only to the initial symmetrical short-circuit current and the
peak short-circuit current.

8.9 Wind Turbines
99
8.9
Wind Turbines
For mechanical to electrical energy conversion, SGs and AGs are used. Direct
current link and inverter are in common use.
The AG needs an inductive reactive power for magnetization. The reactive
power is drawn between diﬀerent generator systems that reﬂect the excitation
power from the grid and provide such inductive reactive power. Wind turbines
can be connected individually or by multiple wind turbines in a wind farm via
underground cables.
The electric power is usually fed at the HV side. Figure 8.17 shows a wind farm
with three wind turbines.
For the calculation of short-circuit currents, the generators and transformers
for wind turbines are combined into one unit. The short-circuit current is calcu-
lated on the HV side of the unit transformer.
The AG supplies in the event of a short circuit to contribute to the short-circuit
current. This aﬀects the thermal, electrical, and mechanical dimensioning of bus-
bars and protection devices. These shorts are as follows:
1) Three-phase short circuit with and without earth
2) Two-phase short circuit with and without earth
3) Single-phase short circuit (ground fault).
Wind turbines with AGs or SGs up to 1 MW are directly coupled to the net-
work. For higher ratings from 1.5 MW, particular SGs and AGs are used with
inverters. They are able to adjust the variable torque of the rotor and the varying
voltage to the requirements of the network.

8 Impedances of Three-Phase Operational Equipment
The gearless SGs with a full-power converter and double-fed AGs have a strong
presence in the market. However, the power converter feeds current harmonics
into the grid. Wind power plants are usually divided into four types, which are
used currently in the electricity networks. Using the IEEE deﬁnitions, the four
types have the following properties
8.9.1
Wind Power Plant with AG
A wind turbine with an AG (WA type one) is connected directly to the network
without a power converter. WA has a soft starter, which is only active during
startup. Figure 8.18 shows the main electrical and mechanical components of a
WA, which is connected to the wind turbine rotor and the induction generator via
a gearbox. The capacitor bank is used for reactive power compensation. This type
of wind turbine with ride-through capabilities typically uses a variable capacitor
bank that is dynamically controlled during and after errors. The power switch
simultaneously disconnects the generator and the capacitors. The wind turbine
terminals can be arranged on both sides of the transformer, as speciﬁed in IEC
61400-21.
Synchronous generators are modeled by an equivalent impedance ZG, which
can be calculated as follows:
ZG = 1
ILR
IrG
⋅
UrG
√
3 ⋅IrG

⋅

(8.47)
For calculating the short-circuit current on the HV power network, ﬁrst the
short-circuit positive-sequence impedance of a wind power plant with a SG is
calculated:
ZW = t2
r ⋅ZG + ZTHV
(8.48)
where UrG is the rated voltage of the AG, IrG is the rated current of the AG, SrG
is the rated apparent power of the AG, ILR/IrG is the ratio of the symmetrical
locked rotor current to the rated current of the AG, ZG is the impedance of the
AG, ZTHV is the impedance of the unit transformer at the HV side, tr is the rated
transformation ratio of the unit transformer: tr = UrTHV/UrTLV.

The type two wind turbine is constructed similarly to type one. The only
diﬀerence is that the turbine is equipped with a variable rotor resistance and,
therefore, uses a variable resistor and a rotor–blade–angle regulation.
8.9.2
Wind Power Plant with a Doubly Fed Asynchronous Generator
In a DFAG (type three), the stator is connected directly to the network. The rotor
is connected by a back-to-back power converter. Figure 8.19 shows the main elec-
trical and mechanical equipment.
The total positive-sequence short-circuit impedance ZWD of a wind power sta-
tion with a DFAG should be calculated as follows:
ZWD =
√
2 ⋅𝜅WD ⋅UrTHV
√
3 ⋅iWD max
(8.49)
where UrTHV is the nominal system voltage, 𝜅WD is given by the manufacturer and
referred to the HV side. If 𝜅WD is not known, then 𝜅WD = 1.7 can be taken, iWDmax
is the highest instantaneous short-circuit value in the case of a three-phase short
circuit.
8.9.3
Wind Power with Full Converter
A wind turbine with a full converter, a full-scale power converter (type 4), is con-
nected directly to the network via a converter. Figure 8.20 shows the essential
electrical and mechanical components. Type 4 uses either SGs or AGs. Some of
these types are used without a transmission (gear box) with direct drive.

8 Impedances of Three-Phase Operational Equipment
Directly related to the network-connected generators are modeled simply by
their subtransient synchronous reactance. Short-circuit currents in generators
with inverters and PV systems are modeled as voltage-controlled current sources.
The currents injected in these investments are limited to the rated current and
do not contribute, or only marginally, for a short-circuit current that must be
speciﬁed by manufacturers.
8.10
Short-Circuit Calculation on Ship and Oﬀshore
Installations
The standard IEC 61363-1 is used for the short-circuit calculation on ship and
oﬀshore installations. The short-circuit current is considered to be close to
the generator because the connections between the components in the entire
network are very short.
The magnitude of the short-circuit current is caused by the reactance of gen-
erators, which are rapidly decayed by diﬀerent preconditions. In the vicinity of
the generator, very high short-circuit currents are to be expected, which strongly
stresses the mechanical and thermal short-circuit strengths of the systems that
are of great importance for the design of switching and protective devices.
Generators normally feed the three-phase system from 11 kV to 690 V. Other
LV systems are supplied with 400 V levels, which have a radial-shaped design.
The MV main BB system provides essential loads of high power (e.g., the pro-
pellers or the engines for a transverse motion and large current motors for air
conditioning or typical functions in the service areas, small loads, or lighting).
The electrical network on ships is made up of diﬀerent plants and contains,
for example, generators, synchronous and asynchronous motors, drives, and
transformers.
For the calculation of short-circuit currents, the maximum number of gener-
ators that can be operated simultaneously and the total number of motors con-
nected to the network at the same time should be taken into consideration. IEC
61363-1 describes the determination of the aperiodic component Iac (t), which is
characterized by the subtransient, transient, and synchronous or steady state.
For the determination of the characteristic parameters are the consideration of
the ﬁrst 100 ms.
Therefore, there is a more stable time dependence of the short-circuit currents
through the small distances to the fault location.
The synchronous machines used on marine/oﬀshore electrical installations
include SGs, motors, and capacitors. Knowledge about the short-circuit currents
of these machines is fundamental for calculating the short-circuit current of an
electrical system. During the ﬁrst few cycles of a short circuit, all synchronous
machines react in a similar manner and according to the short-circuit current
have the same basic characteristics. For shunt energized machines, the exci-
tation current during the short-circuit condition can drop to close to zero by
discharging the short-circuit current. On connected machines, the short-circuit
current is controlled and the excitation current maintained. Compound excited

8.10 Short-Circuit Calculation on Ship and Oﬀshore Installations
103
machines produce higher values of short-circuit currents after the subtransients
eﬀects have subsided.
In the case of a short circuit of generators, three diﬀerent reactances are
produced that increase in the order indicated. The subtransient reactance
is smaller than the transient reactance and this is in turn smaller than the
stationary reactance. Thus, the short-circuit currents decrease. The reactance of
the generator decreases faster than the direct current component. This can lead
to switch oﬀand saturation problems of the magnetic circuits. In this case, the
zero crossing of the current takes place after several periods.
The calculation of the short-circuit current of a synchronous machine is
based on the curve of the maximum values of the machine with the actual,
time-dependent short-circuit current.
The resultant envelope is a function of the basic machine parameters
(current, impedance, etc.) and the active voltages. The impedances are depen-
dent on the machine-operating conditions immediately before the occurrence of
the short-circuit condition.
The calculation of the short-circuit current is the highest value of the current,
which varies as a function of time along the upper envelope curve of the complex
time-dependent function. The current deﬁned by this upper envelope curve is
calculated by the following equation:
ik(t) =
√
2 ⋅Ia.c.(t) + id.c.(t)
(8.50)
With the subtransient and transient periods, the ac component of the time
function is described by subtransient, transient, and continuous currents. These
periods are controlled by the subtransient time constant T′′
d and the transient
time constant T′
d.
Iac(t) = (I′′

(8.51)
The subtransient and transient initial values of the three-phase short-circuit
currents, I′′

tive impedance using the following equations:

the generator impedance, and the time constant. However, it is acceptable to cal-
culate ip at time T/2 in the ﬁrst half-wave of the short-circuit state using the

8 Impedances of Three-Phase Operational Equipment
Each WEP consists of a permanently excited SG that produces two three-phase
systems. The energy is inverted and supplied in the network after being transmit-
ted via an intermediate direct currency link. The value of the supplied current
comes up to the power that is available. A special attribute of this principle is
that the generator increases the short-circuit current in the system by its rated
current. The increase in the short-circuit power of the system is negligible. While
normal generators would increase the current during a short circuit, this system
just supplies a current equal to the rated current. Consequently, the WEP acts
as a constant current generator, and it is essential that Z2 = Z1 is taken for the
whole wind farm. The evaluation of such a generator is diﬃcult. On this account,
simpliﬁcations are made.

Calculations of Impedances
The installed WEPs are to be considered as though there would not be rotating
elements because of their attitude. This means that Z2 = Z1 and
Z2
Z1
= 1
The calculated impedances prove that Z0 ≥Z1, which means
Z0
Z1
> 1
and
Z1
Z0
< 1
From Table 8.20 and Figure 8.23, the maximal current results from a
three-phase short circuit and the minimal current results from a one-phase
short circuit may be inferred.
During a one-phase short circuit, the WEPs and their transformer aﬀect the
impedances of the positive and negative sequences. The calculation of their
impedances shows that these values are very large when compared with values
of the network and power transformer. Also, the impedance of the inverter
is expected to be very large. As a result, the impedances are negligible, so
that the positive and negative impedances could be increased to downsize the
short-circuit current. It also would be possible, because of calm, that every single
WEP would not supply power. To calculate even the minimal short circuit, these
simpliﬁcations are acceptable.
The coupling impedance of the power transformer is also negligible. Further-
more, the real value of this impedance must be measured. All capacitances are
neglected because of the resulting big resistance.
In case of a maximal short circuit, the current of the WEP is just the rated cur-
rent and is to be added to the calculated current. All negligences are considered

abovementioned coupling impedance is equal to the impedance of the positive
sequence. In the following example (Figure 8.24), a short circuit at the end of
a 750-m cable is calculated (short circuit at the 34.5-kV BB is connected to

Symmetrical components of a partial network for one-phase short-circuit are
shown in Figure 8.25.
According to the standards for short-circuit calculations, for the minimal

increased resistance is necessary. The following results are based on an increased
cable temperature of 80 and 160 ∘C.

Backup Protection and Protection Equipment
If a one-phase short circuit occurs between the transformer of a WEP and the
fuse next in line, a big current ﬂows from the 154-kV network toward the failure
location. In this case, the fuse (40 A) is the protection system that needs to be
activated before the circuit breaker. The time–current characteristic gives us the
needed activation time (Figure 8.27). Concerning the worst case, the smallest and,
therefore, the longest activation times are to be observed.
For the minimal short-circuit current:
Branch of WEP 28–42: 705 A on BB 42
Branch of WEP 1–13: 668 A on BB 42
Branch of WEP 14–253: 691 A on BB 42

Thermal Stress of Cables
It shows that a short circuit on BB 32 aﬀects the biggest current. This branch with
15 WEPs is connected via a 120-m cable to the main BB in the transformer station.
If this short circuit occurs, the whole current ﬂow excluding the rated current of
15 WEPs is on that cable. The current is Idiﬀ= 3661A −150A = 3511A.
To collect the thermal stress of cables, the thermal equivalent short-time cur-
rent is to be calculated ﬁrst as follows:
Ith = I′′
k ⋅
√
(m + n)
The coeﬃcient m is reproducing the thermal eﬀect of the direct current por-
tion of a three-phase and single-phase current. The coeﬃcient n is reproducing
the thermal eﬀect of the a.c. portion of a three-phase system. Both values are
explained in Chapter 11.
For electronic devices like cables and switches, the rated short-time current Ithr
for the rated short-circuit time Tkr (mostly ones) is given by the manufacturer. Ith
is the root mean square (RMS) current to be carried by the electrical device for
the duration Tk. Electrical devices are thermally stable if:
Ith ≤Ithr
if Tk ≤Tkr
And
Ith ≤Ithr ⋅
√
Tkr
Tk
if Tk ≥Tkr
According to Ref. [1], n is a function of I′′
k/Ik. In this case, I′′Ik = Ik means that
n = 1.2, and m is a function of R1/X1 in failure location. Z1 is as follows:
Z1 = j4.66Ω + j2.86Ω + 0.196mΩ
km ⋅0.12km + j0.14mΩ
km ⋅0.12km
= 0.023Ω + j7.54Ω
From this, the following occurs
R1
X1
= 0.023Ω
7.54Ω = 0.03
The factor 𝜅≈1.95 can be read from the curves in Figure 8.29. Given the factor
𝜅≈1.95 and the permissible duration of the short circuit tLs = 130 ms, the ther-
mal eﬀect of the d.c. component m =1.05 can also be obtained from Figure 8.30.

The rated short-time current for cables with a cross-section of q = 95 mm2 is
as follows:

This is the speciﬁc value for a rated short-circuit time Tkr = 1 s. In this case, the
short-circuit time is Tk = 0.13 s. Thus, the condition Ith ≤Ithr is fulﬁlled.
In the case of a short circuit, a high thermal load is not applied.

Neutral Point Connection
Star-to-star (Y–Y) transformers are installed. The delivery of a WEP unit provides
a star-to-delta (Y–Δ) transformer, which can be grounded on the LV side but not
on the MV side. Thus, the conditions of a service company envision a neutral
point transformer (NPT) for the purpose of grounding the Y–Δ transformer. An
NPT is analyzed and its possible applications are discussed as follows.
8.11.7.6
Neutral Point Transformer (NPT)
In practice, two types of NPTs are used.
1) NPT with Y–Δ winding
2) NPT with zigzag–zigzag (Z–Z) winding.
NPTs with Y–Δ winding are to be handled as though they would be normal
Y–Δ transformers (Figure 8.31).
With equal conditions, an NPT with Z–Z winding (Figure 8.32) gives a mini-
mized need of material and a reduction in the nominal power by

these types require a galvanic connection of both windings, and if the rated
voltage is >1.15 kV, a large gap between the windings and the core is also
necessary.
Due to earlier cited reasons, only an NPT with Y–Δ winding is considered.
Furthermore, the diﬀerent operational areas of the NPT are shown.
8.11.7.7
Network with Current-Limiting Resistor
In this example, the ﬁrst cable with a length of 750 m of a branch is considered
and a one-phase short circuit is calculated. The following ﬁgures show the simple
diagram without (Figure 8.33) and with a connected NPT (Figure 8.34). Also,
the equivalent circuit diagrams are shown as follows (Figures 8.35 and 8.36). The
impedances of the WEP and its transformer are neglected.
First of all, the zero sequence is observed, because modiﬁcations only occur in
this sequence when connecting an NPT. As shown, the impedance of the NPT
is connected in parallel to one of the power transformers and the network. At
ﬁrst, imaginary data are adopted to calculate the changed impedance as well as
the current. With this current, it is possible to ﬁnd out the current I′′

The example shows the cycle of the calculation program by computing the max-
imal one-phase short circuit with an NPT connected to the network. In addition
to the named simpliﬁcation, the reactances of all resources are neglected. The
data for the resources are as follows:

The 240-mm2 cable is neglected.
The NPT is a common Y–Δ transformer with
SnPT = 300 kW
Un = 34.5 kV

= 47.36Ω + j31.86Ω

This current is divided between the impedances X0Q + X0T1 + 3 ⋅RE + X0K2 and
XSt0:
|X0Q + X0T + 3 ⋅RE + X0K2| = |j14Ω + j8.57Ω + 3 ⋅20Ω + j0.422Ω|

64.3 Ω follows Ik01 ≈3.7 ⋅Ik02, Ik02 ≈0.27 ⋅Ik01.

k1max.
The currents are divided as shown in Figure 8.37. After dividing the currents,
the values are Ik02 = 209A and Ik01 = 772A.
The current Ik02 is the dimension for the required power of the NPT. If a failure
like this occurs, the disconnecting time from the wind farm will be tk < 10 s. Thus,
the power of the NPT could be reduced to about 8%.

As shown, the adopted power of the NPT increases. A downsized impedance
follows from an increased power, which does not make sense. The only way to
adapt the NPT is to increase the short-circuit voltage. With Microsoft Excel,
these calculations are very eﬃcient and easy. Acceptable values for an NPT are as
follows:

As a result, the installation as previously shown would not give the desired
eﬀects. The results are a parallel impedance and as a result of that an increased
short-circuit current.
The current with and without an NPT is compared and tabulated in Table 8.23.
8.11.7.8
Compensated Network
A compensated neutral point is another possibility to operate the network, which
means that a Peterson coil is to be installed into the neutral point. Note that a
Y–Y transformer is unserviceable for connecting a coil. The coupling impedance
transforms zero potential in case of an earth fault. That aﬀects unsymmetrical
voltage measures even on the faultless side of the transformer. Thus, an NPT is
necessary.
If a one-phase earth fault occurs, the capacities of the cables provoke a capaci-
tive current. It is possible to compensate that current with an additional current
in opposite phase, which is supplied by a Peterson coil.
If the installed cables and their capacities are known, then it is possible to gen-
erate the awaiting current as follows:
IE = 3 ⋅𝜔⋅CE ⋅Ur
√
3
(8.66)
CE is the capacity of all cables installed:
Total length of 95-mm2 cables: l = 11.47 km
Total length of 240-mm2 cables: l = 2 × 0.025 km
The capacity is
CE = 11.47km ⋅0.165 μF
km + 2 ⋅0.025km ⋅0.227 μF
km = 1.9μF
Earth current can be given as:
IE = 3 ⋅2 ⋅𝜋⋅50Hz ⋅1.9μF ⋅34.5kV
√
3
≈35.7A
The needed inductivity of the coil is
XC ≈
1
3 ⋅𝜔⋅CE
(8.67)
The nominal power of the NPT infers from the calculated earth fault current.
When compensating a network, one-phase earth faults can occur without

8.11 Examples
125
activating the circuit breaker. The outcome of this is a better reliability. Without
having a compensated network, every single connection between the earth and
a single phase would disconnect the wind farm from the network.
The needed nominal power of the NPT is to be calculated by referring to the
awaiting earth fault current:
SSt = 35.7A ⋅34.5kV
√
3
= 711kVA ≈750kVA
When installing a coil, the current-limiting resistor is to be released.
In addition to a Peterson coil and an NPT, special instruments and the under-
standing of these instruments are necessary to permit operation while one-phase
earth faults.
Among the installation of a compensating coil, additional devices are to be
ﬁtted. These are necessary to report an occurred earth fault or even to localize it.
Due to the occurrence of voltage rise during an earth fault, it is simple to realize
it. In compensated networks, not only the error recognition, but also the location
is desired. To that, the following devices are to be ﬁtted:
• cable-type current transformer
• earth fault relay (i.e., 7SN93, 7TG207SA511, or 7SN73 of Siemens)
• voltage converter for the recording of the displacement voltage.
If the mentioned resources are ﬁtted, it is possible to locate an earth fault
exactly. Once localized, the corresponding part of the cable can be disconnected
without disturbing the normal operation.
People working in the control room and people checking the wind farm must
be specially trained and developed to be able to act correctly in case of an earth
fault. Basic knowledge about the behavior during an earth fault is inevitable.
Among the additional installation of protection devices and earth fault relays,
the voltage jump is to be considered. All devices ﬁtted in the network are to be
designed for such an increased voltage.
8.11.7.9
Insulated Network
Along with the previously mentioned possibilities, there is also the possibility of
operating the network with an insulated neutral point. In this case, the prescrip-
tions [13] are to be observed.
It shows that the permissible value for an earth fault current with a nominal
voltage of Un = 34.5 kV is about the value of IE = 35.7 A.
Resulting from that, the current-limiting resistor could be removed. However,
the risk of the intermittent earth fault is considered. From this point of view, this
kind of neutral point connection is not recommended.
8.11.7.10
Grounding System
Among the neutral point connection, the eﬃciency of the grounding system is of
primary interest according to the protection of human beings and animals. The
EN 50522 is recommended (e.g., the voltage rise while failure is dangerous). The

126
8 Impedances of Three-Phase Operational Equipment
dimensioning and the judgment of the grounding systems quality is divided in
four attributes:
• speciﬁcation of the form and connection of the devices
• speciﬁcation of the tolerable grounding voltage
• speciﬁcation of the tolerable step and touch voltage
• speciﬁcation of the maximal current permissible body current.
The regulation EN 50522 is based on the ﬁrst three attributes.
Insulated and compensated networks are expressly attended because an earth
fault within these networks does not involve a fast disconnection, but a con-
tinuous operation, as [2] the maximal tolerable touch voltage is UT = 75 V a.c.
In addition, Ref. [2] provides the conditions for the maximal resistance of the
grounding system.
The following conditions are to be fulﬁlled:
ZE < 2 ⋅UT
IE
For the whole network, the resistance of the grounding system is assumed with
ZE < 2 Ω.
The following is calculated:
2 ⋅

35.7 A = 4.2Ω > ZE. The conditions are then fulﬁlled.

Impedance Corrections
The magnitude of the short-circuit currents in a network depends primarily on
the design of the network, the generators or power station blocks, and the motors
operating and secondarily on the operating state of the network before the occur-
rence of the short circuit. It is therefore diﬃcult to ﬁnd the loading state that leads
to either the greatest or the smallest short-circuit current at the diﬀerent fault
locations of the network.
IEC 60909 thus recommends the method of calculation with the equivalent
voltage source c ⋅Un∕
√
3 at the fault location. Investigations have shown that the
voltage factor c is no longer suﬃcient for calculating the maximum short-circuit
current when the subtransient behavior of the generators, power station blocks
with or without step switches, and network transformers is considered.
The factor c in Table 1.1 shows that on the average, the highest voltage in a
normal network does not deviate by more than about +5% for low voltage and
+10% for high voltage from the network voltage Un. In a common network with
50 or 60 Hz, the highest and lowest voltages do not diﬀer by more than ±10% from
the network voltage. In the North American countries, the highest voltage diﬀers
by not more than +5% and the lowest voltage −10% from the network voltage [1].
The conditions of Section 1.4.2 apply only when the voltage diﬀerences in a
network are <10%. Special conditions can occur for generators and power station
blocks with high values of x′′
d and uk, causing voltage drops of more than +10%.
For this reason, the introduction of impedance correction factors is necessary,
above all in order to obtain reliable values for the determination of the greatest
short-circuit current.
For the dimensioning of electrical operational equipment, the calculation of
the greatest short-circuit current and the greatest partial short-circuit current is
necessary. In this section, we will discuss the required correction factors.
For the calculation of the largest short-circuit current and the transferred
short-circuit current, it is necessary to make corrections to the generator
impedances (KG) and the power plant block impedances (KKW) in addition to
the factor cmax, especially when the subtransient reactances x′′
d of the generators
are large and the transformation ratio of the block transformers diﬀers from the
network voltages during the operation on both sides of the transformer [1].

The calculation of the smallest short-circuit current requires special consider-
ations, such as
• the smallest power supplied for thermal power stations
• the largest reactive power of machine units for pumping power stations
• special equipment for limiting the load angle
• loading state of power station units during low-load periods.
9.1
Correction Factor KG for Generators
The impedance correction factor KG is applied to the impedance of generators
connected directly to the network (Figure 9.1).
KG is derived from the overexcited generator, by taking account of the subtran-
sient reactance X′′
d and subtransient internal voltage E′′ [1]. The impedance of the
generator in the positive-phase system is as follows:
ZG = RG + jX′′

Correction Factor KKW for Power Plant Block
For the determination of the impedance correction factor KKW as in Figure 9.2,
the following considerations are necessary [1].
• Whether the block transformer is equipped with a step switch or with a higher
transformation ratio.
• Whether the rated voltages of the generator and the low-voltage side of the
block transformer are diﬀerent.
• Whether the rated apparent powers of the generator and transformer are also
diﬀerent.
The voltage control is implemented either on the high-voltage side of the trans-
former or via the inherent voltage regulation of the generator. Here, it is necessary
to distinguish between a transformer with and without tap changer.

Power System Analysis
This chapter describes the mathematical basic circuit theory of the three-phase
system to be repeated. Figure 10.1 shows a delta and star connection with three-
phase voltages. Star point is connected to a neutral point (N).
In the single-phase load, the neutral conductor current IN is ﬂowing back to
the source. The beginning and the end of the delta circuit are connected to one
another. The neutral conductor is not applicable for medium-voltage and high-
voltage networks. The symbols of the live conductors are given according to the
IEC 60027 or International System of Units (SI system). In the literature and in
some countries, the letters a, b, and c are also used.
The currents of the three conductors L1–L2–L3 (before R, S, and T) in three-
phase systems are of symmetrical construction (i.e., they have the same size and
each phase shifted by 120∘and applies to impedances ZR = ZS = ZT = Z).
Therefore, voltages, currents, and powers are drawn as a single phase calculated
and simulated by a single-phase equivalent circuit diagram.
The symmetry of a three-phase system can be disturbed by ground fault, short
circuit, and multiple faults. In this case, the currents are not equal in size and
have diﬀerent phase angles to each other. The single-phase diagram is no longer
suﬃcient.
Here and in other chapters, the calculation equations for three-phase systems
and the method of symmetrical components will be described.
The individual-phase voltages can be represented as follows:
u1(t) = ̂u ⋅sin(𝜔t)
u2(t) = ̂u ⋅sin(𝜔t −120∘)
(10.1)
u3(t) = ̂u ⋅sin(𝜔t −240∘)
Another way to describe the phase voltages is
U1 = U1 ⋅ej0∘
U2 = U1 ⋅e−j120∘
(10.2)
U3 = U1 ⋅e−j240∘
The sum of the three symmetrical voltages is always zero.

Electrical power systems operate normally in a balanced three-phase sinu-
soidal steady-state mode. In the case of an unbalanced operation, it is diﬃcult
to describe the system. In 1918, C.L. Fortescue explained how unbalanced
three-phase voltages and currents could be transformed into balanced
three-phase components. He called it symmetrical components of the orig-
inal phasors. The theory of symmetrical components is of great importance to
the electrical power systems and is the subject of the next topic.

The Method of Symmetrical Components
The method of symmetrical components is used for the calculation of asymmetri-
cal faults. This section discusses the fundamentals of this method. A characteris-
tic rotational operator is a complex number with the magnitude 1. Multiplication
with a rotational operator, therefore, describes the rotation of an arbitrary phasor
without changing its magnitude. From the set of complex numbers, we know the
rotational operator j = √−1, which gives rise to a rotation by 90∘. Accordingly,
j2 = −1 then gives rise to a rotation by 180∘, and j4 brings the phasor back to its
original position. In three-phase systems, the phase angles 𝜑= 120∘and 240∘are
of special importance.
Figure 10.2 shows a symmetrical system, which consists of three-unit phasors
separated by angles of 120∘.
The rotational operator for 𝜑= 120∘is designated and for 240∘, it is designated
a2 so that:
a = ej120 = ej(2𝜋∕3) = 1

As can be easily seen from the above equations, their sum is equal to zero:

With the rotational operators a and a2, the symmetrical three-phase system
belongs to the set of complex numbers.

10.2
Fundamentals of Symmetrical Components
Symmetrical faults are calculated from the equivalent circuit in the positive-
sequence system. The network is thereby reduced to a single conductor and
drawn as a single-phase system. Three-phase short circuits load the network
symmetrically. For the other types of short circuits, it is no longer possible to
use the positive-sequence system as the network is loaded asymmetrically. It is
here that the method of symmetrical components is well suited.
For each conductor of a three-phase system, the corresponding equations (cur-
rents or voltages in the conductors) are written. Asymmetrical operation, a short
circuit to ground, line interruptions, or switching mechanisms can be the result
of network loading. The voltages and currents at the position of the short cir-
cuit are determined by the geometrical addition of the symmetrical component
voltages and currents.
With this method, the three-phase network is resolved into three independent
single-phase systems, namely, the positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and
zero-sequence systems.
The impedances of these three systems can then be given for individual opera-
tional systems at a fault position. According to the position of the fault, unequal
currents can arise in the conductors. Then, the equivalent single-phase circuit
can no longer be used. The transformation of the original R (L1), S (L2), T (L3)
to a symmetrical image space with the coordinates 1, 2, 0 is, therefore, necessary
(method of symmetrical components).
The procedure that the method entails will now be discussed in detail [14,
15, 16]. In the case of an unsymmetrical three-phase system, the corresponding

equations (conductor currents or voltages) are set up for each conductor of the
three-phase system. Therefore, each unsymmetrical system can be clearly shown
in a partial three-symmetrical system (Figure 10.3).
A three-phase fault aﬀects the three-phase network symmetrically. All three
conductors are equally involved and carry the same amount of short-circuit
current. Therefore, the calculation is performed for only one conductor. On the
other hand, all other short-circuit conditions incur asymmetrical loadings. A
suitable method for investigating such events is to split the asymmetrical system
into its symmetrical components (Figure 10.4). With a symmetrical voltage

system, the currents produced by an asymmetrical loading (I1, I2, and I3) can
be determined with the aid of the symmetrical components (positive-sequence,
negative-sequence, and zero-sequence systems).
The symmetrical components can be found with the aid of complex calculation
or by graphical means. If the current vector leading the current in the reference
conductor (L1) is rotated 120∘backward, and the lagging current vector 120∘
forward, the resultant is equal to three times the vector Im in the reference con-
ductor. The negative-sequence components are apparent. If one turns in the other
direction, the positive-sequence system is evident, and the resultant is three times
the vector I2 in the reference conductor. Geometrical addition of all three current
vectors (I1, I2, and I3) yields three times the vector I0 in the reference conductor.
If the neutral conductor is unaﬀected, there is no zero-sequence system. Unsym-
metrical faults at one point in the network can be caused by unbalanced loads or
unbalanced short circuits through impedances or open conductors. Basically, a
procedure is followed that describes the unsymmetry in the three-phase mains,
and this description then transfers to the symmetrical components so as to deter-
mine in what way the positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and zero-sequence
systems must be connected together at the point of unsymmetry.
10.2.1
Derivation of the Transformation Equations
The decomposition presented in positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and
zero-sequence systems can be described by the following equations (using the
example of the currents; applies equivalently for voltages):
IR = I1R + I2R + I0R
(10.19)
IS = I1S + I2S + I0S
IT = I1T + I2T + I0T
(10.20)
I0R = I0S + I0T + I0
The system of equations can be further simpliﬁed by taking advantage of the
fact that the three phasors of the positive-sequence and negative-sequence sys-
tems are out of phase with each other with the same amount to 120∘, respectively,
and that the three phasors of the zero-sequence system are identical to each other.
These relationships can be taken into account when considering each case, a pha-
sor in the three systems as a reference. Usually, the components pointer I1R, I2R,
and I0R of the conductor R are chosen as a reference. The phase position can
thereby be expressed as follows:
1 = ej0∘
a = ej120 = ej(2𝜋∕3)
a2 = e−j120 = e−j(2𝜋∕3)
Calculations in 120∘space:
I1S = I1R ⋅a2
I1T = I1R ⋅a
I2S = I2R ⋅a
(10.21)
I2T = I2T ⋅a2
I0R = I0S ⋅I0T

140
10 Power System Analysis
Fault currents in the original space:
IR = I1R + I2R + I0R
(10.22)
IS = I1R ⋅a2 + I2R ⋅a + I0R
IT = I1T ⋅a + I2R ⋅a2 + I0R
(10.23)
Then, in matrix notation, we have

Inverse transformation from the image space to the original space:
[IRST] = [T] ⋅[I120]
(10.25)
With this transformation, we can transform the unknown current components
with the matrix T to the actual currents in the components:
I1R = 1
3 ⋅(IR + IS ⋅a + IT ⋅a2)
(10.26)
I2R = 1
3 ⋅(IR + IS ⋅a2 + IT ⋅a)

General Description of the Calculation Method
The method for calculating the short-circuit currents can be applied according
to the following general scheme to the diﬀerent types of errors. The procedure of
symmetrical components will also be shown using the example of a single-phase
short-circuit current (Figure 10.5). The short circuits are for reference conductors
R symmetrically.
The following proceeding are considered in the calculation:
1) Set up the fault conditions in RST components.
2) Transformation of the fault conditions in symmetrical components (012).
3) Draw the circuit diagram in symmetrical components.
4) Set of the equations and calculation of short-circuit currents and voltages.
5) Transformation of the short-circuit currents and voltages in RST compo-
nents.

A short circuit with earth contact of the conductor R has the consequence that
the voltage of the conductor assumes the value zero.

rical components.

Step 3: The fault conditions can be realized only if all positive-sequence,
negative-sequence, and zero-sequence components are connected in series.
In this case, the zero system into the power grid is not included in the calcu-
lation of the single-phase short-circuit current because a decoupling of zero
systems enters through the transformer. The impedance of the network must be
converted with the square of the transmission ratio to the short side.
By combining the individual impedances, the relationships of equations can be
given as follows:
Z1 = Z1Qt + Z1T + Z1L
Z2 = Z2Qt + Z2T + Z2L
Z0 = Z0T + Z0L
Step 4: For the currents and voltages, the relationship will be

Impedances of Symmetrical Components
Only three-phase short circuits load the network symmetrically. It is suﬃcient
to calculate with the “positive-sequence system.” In all other cases, it is also
necessary to use the method of symmetrical components to consider the
negative-sequence and zero-sequence systems.
The method of symmetrical components is based on the principle of superpo-
sition. The determination of the voltage and current components requires equiv-
alent single-phase circuits, which, during symmetrical operation of the network,
are fully decoupled from each other.
The three impedances of the component systems are summarized brieﬂy
(Figure 10.6) [1].
1) Positive-phase impedance Z1 (index m or 1): A symmetrical positive-sequence
system with a normal phase angle is present. The equivalent circuit and the
data for the operational equipment are identical with the data for the equiva-
lent single-phase circuit for the calculation of the three-phase short circuit.
2) Negative-sequence impedance Z2 (index i or 2): A symmetrical negative-
sequence system is present. The negative-sequence impedance is the same as
the positive-sequence impedance for operational equipment without load.
The impedances are diﬀerent when the machines are operating.

systems.

10.4 Impedances of Symmetrical Components
143
3) Negative-sequence impedance Z0 (index 0): A system consisting of three cur-
rents of equal value and having the same phase angle is present if we take the
three main conductors connected in parallel for the outgoing line and a fourth
conductor as a common return line and apply an a.c. voltage. Three times the
zero-sequence current ﬂows in this return line.
The circuitry of the N is considered in the zero-sequence impedance as follows:
• not grounded
• grounded through a ground fault neutralizer coil
• grounded through resistances or reactance
• direct grounding.
Under the assumption that the symmetrical components for the current and
voltage are physically real values, they must be related through general physi-
cal laws. Then, it must be possible to assign an impedance to each of the three
component systems according to Ohm’s law.
Positive-sequence impedance:
Z(1) =
U(1)
I(1)
(10.31)
Negative-sequence impedance:
Z(2) =
U(2)
I(2)
(10.32)
Zero-sequence impedance:
Z(0) =
U(0)
I(0)
(10.33)
Furthermore, it is possible to deﬁne equivalent circuits for the three compo-
nent systems. The positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and zero-sequence
impedances can be determined by applying the positive-sequence, negative-
sequence, and zero-sequence voltages to the circuit to be measured, mea-
suring the current and then calculating the impedance from Ohm’s law. The
positive-sequence impedance is identical with the impedance of a conductor
in the three-phase system and is, therefore, the same as the impedance of an
equivalent single-phase circuit in symmetrical operation. It is the sum total
of the impedances in the conductor from the overland lines, machines, and
other components. The negative-sequence impedance is determined as for the
positive-sequence impedance but with a negative-sequence system voltage. As
can be seen from the measurement circuit in Figure 10.7, the negative-sequence
impedance must be the same as the positive-sequence impedance for all passive
operational equipment such as overhead lines, cables, and transformers. For
rotating machines, on the other hand, the negative-sequence impedance can be
smaller than the positive-sequence impedance.
The zero-sequence impedance is, by deﬁnition (no phase shift of the individual
components), measured single phase, and the three conductors are connected in

negative-sequence, and zero-sequence systems must be linked, and linking
requires knowledge of the source voltage. This procedure is described in detail
in the following sections.
In three-phase networks, the source voltage is generated symmetrically with
synchronous generators. For this reason, the source voltage appears only in the
positive-sequence system and is set to the value c⋅Un
√
3 for the calculations.
All three equivalent circuit components are connected to the fault position,
and for each type of fault, there is a diﬀerent connection (Figure 10.8).

and loads explaining SI and other symbols. The letters a, b, c, R, Y, B are not

Calculation of Short-Circuit Currents
In IEC 60909-0, the diﬀerent types of short circuits are clearly deﬁned. This
chapter deals with the short-circuit currents and sets up the equations required
to determine these currents. For the calculation, RST components are used
instead of L1–L2–L3 for reasons of simpliﬁcation.
11.1
Three-Phase Short Circuits
For the dimensioning of electrical systems, it is necessary to consider three-phase
short circuits in order to guarantee the mechanical and thermal stabilities of the
systems and the rated making and breaking capabilities of the overcurrent pro-
tection equipment.
The requirements for calculating the largest three-phase short-circuit current
are as follows:
• The temperature of the conductor is 20 ∘C.
• The network circuitry is mostly responsible for this current.
• The network feeder delivers the maximum short-circuit power.
• The voltage factor is chosen in accordance with IEC 60909-0.
The three-phase short circuit is a symmetrical fault. The following fault condi-
tions apply for the equivalent circuit (Figure 11.1):
UR = US = UT = 0

Two-Phase Short Circuit Without Contact
to Ground
According to Figure 11.4, a two-phase fault without contact to ground should
occur between the two conductors.
For the equations giving the currents:
IS = −IT,
IR = 0
The zero-sequence system current is zero, because no current ﬂows through
ground, that is, I0 = 0, U0 = 0.
For a two-phase short-circuit current, this results in

11.4
Single-Phase Short Circuits to Ground
The single-phase short-circuit current occurs frequently in electrical networks
(Figure 11.6). Its calculation is necessary in order to ensure
• The maximum conductor lengths (IEC 60364 part 52)
• Protection against indirect contact (IEC 60364 part 41)
• Protection against thermal stress (IEC 60364 part 43).Calculating the smallest
short-circuit current requires that
• The voltage factor used is taken from IEC 60909-0
• Motors can be neglected
• In low-voltage networks, the temperature of the conductors is set to 80 ∘C
• Setting up the network so that the smallest I′′
k1min ﬂows. For the component
systems shown in Figure 11.7, we can then use the values: IS = IT = 0, I′′
k1 =
IR, UR = 0.

Since the currents in the positive-sequence, negative-sequence, and zero-

It follows for a single-phase short circuit under the condition Z1 = Z2 that
I′′

(11.18)
For the loop impedance of the short circuit:

(11.19)
Equating the right sides of Equations (11.18) and (11.19) yields

Equations (11.18), (11.19), and (11.21) are identical and give the same result for
the calculation of I′′
k1min.
Figure 11.7 shows the phasor diagrams of the corresponding positive, negative,
and zero systems and the resulting components.
For asymmetrical short circuits, the largest short-circuit current can be deter-
mined with the aid of Figure 11.8 and depends on the network design. The double
ground fault, I′′
kEE, is not included in this ﬁgure, because it leads to smaller short
circuits than the two-phase short circuit. The ranges of the diﬀerent types of short
circuits according to the neutral point treatment are indicated in this diagram.
The phase angles of the impedances Z1, Z2, and Z0 in this ﬁgure must not diﬀer
by more than 15∘.

Peak Short-Circuit Current, ip
The initial short-circuit current, I′′
k , and the withstand ratio, 𝜅, determine the
peak short-circuit current, ip. The factor 𝜅depends on the ratio R/X of the
short-circuit path and takes account of the decay of the d.c. aperiodic component
in the short circuit. The peak value of ip occurs during the period immediately
following the occurrence of the short circuit (transient period). If the ratio R/X
is known, the factor 𝜅can be read from the curves in Figure 11.9.
The peak short-circuit current calculated determines the dynamic loading of
electrical systems.
The peak short-circuit current can be calculated in unmeshed networks from

possible to determine the factor 𝜅in meshed networks [12].
1) Procedure A (𝜅= 𝜅a): 𝜅is determined from the smallest R/X ratio of all the
branches in the network. In low-voltage networks, 𝜅≤1.8.
2) Procedure B (𝜅= 1.15𝜅b): 𝜅is determined from the R/X ratio of the
short-circuit impedance at the position F of the short circuit and multiplied
by a safety factor of 1.15 in order to take account of diﬀerent R/X ratios in
parallel branches.
• For low-voltage networks: 𝜅≤1.8.
• For medium-voltage and high-voltage networks: 𝜅≤2.0.
3) Procedure C (𝜅= 𝜅c ): with procedure C, 𝜅is determined with an equivalent
frequency, as below:
• Calculation of reactances for all network branches i for the equivalent fre-
quency f c in the positive-sequence system:
Xic = fc
f Xi
f : nominal frequency – 50, 60 Hz.
f c: equivalent frequency – 20, 24 Hz.
• Calculation of equivalent impedance at the position of the short circuit
from the resistances Ri and the reactances Xi of the network branches in
the positive-sequence system: Zc = Rc + jXc
• Determination of the factor 𝜅c from the ratio:

11.6
Symmetrical Breaking Current, Ia
The symmetrical breaking current is the eﬀective value of the short-circuit
current I′′
k (t), which ﬂows through the switch at the time of the ﬁrst con-
tact separation and is used for near-to-generator short-circuit feeder. For
far-from-generator short circuits, the breaking currents are identical to the
initial short-circuit currents:
Ia = 𝜇⋅I′′
k
(11.24)
Synchronous machines:
Ia = 𝜇I′′
kG
(11.25)
Ia depends on the duration of the short circuit and the installation position
of the switchgear at the position of the short circuit. 𝜇characterizes the decay
behavior of the short-circuit current and is a function of the variables I′′
kG∕I′′
rG and
tmin (Figure 11.10).
The factor 𝜇can be taken from Figure 11.10 or from the following equations:
𝜇= 0.84 + 0.26e−0.26I′′
kG∕IrG
for tmin = 0.02s
𝜇= 0.71 + 0.51e−0.30I′′

𝜇= 0.56 + 0.94e−0.38I′′
kG∕IrG

used in the calculation of q, see IEC 60909-0.
The factor q applies to the induction motors and takes account of the rapid
decay of the motor short circuit owing to the absence of an excitation ﬁeld. It can
be obtained from Figure 11.11 or from the following equations:
q = 1.03 + 0.12 ln m
for tmin = 0.02s
q = 0.79 + 0.12 ln m

For the steady-state short-circuit current, we distinguish between:
Ikmax = Amax⋅IrG (maximum excitation).
Ikmin = Amin⋅IrG (constant unregulated excitation).
The upper and lower limits of A can be taken from Figure 11.12. It should also
be pointed out that the A curves depend on the ratio of the maximum excitation
voltage to the excitation voltage under normal load conditions (Series 1and 2).

The following statements can be made for Series 1and 2 [1]:
Series 1: The largest possible excitation voltage is 1.3 times the rated excitation
voltage for the rated apparent power factor for turbo generators or 1.6 times
the rated excitation voltage for salient-phase generators.
Series 2: The largest possible excitation voltage is 1.6 times the rated excitation
voltage for the rated apparent power factor for turbo generators or 1.3 times
the rated excitation voltage for salient-phase generators.

Motors in Electrical Networks
Asynchronous motors are used mostly in industry and for the internal con-
sumption of power stations. For a short circuit, these deliver a part of the initial
short-circuit current, peak short-circuit current, and symmetrical breaking
current and for single-phase faults, part of the steady-state short-circuit current
as well.
The peak short-circuit part of the asynchronous motors must be considered.
For the calculation of squirrel-cage motors and wound rotor motors, there is no
diﬀerence, since the starting resistors of wound rotor motors are short-circuited
during operation. In the following cases, asynchronous motors can be neglected
for the calculation of short-circuit currents [1]:
• Asynchronous motors in public low-voltage networks.
• Contributions of asynchronous motors or motor groups, which are less than
5% of the initial symmetrical short-circuit current without motors.
• Asynchronous motors which due to interlocking or type of process control
cannot operate at the same time.
• Groups of low-voltage asynchronous motors that can be combined through
their connection cables to an equivalent motor with
ILR
IrM = 5 and
RM
XM = 0.42.
• Asynchronous motors can be neglected for single-phase short circuits.
Various connection variants for asynchronous motors in industrial networks
will be discussed in the following.

Mechanical and Thermal Short-Circuit Strength
The dimensioning of electrical power installations with respect to stability against
mechanical and thermal stresses is described exactly in EN 60865-1 [17]. This
chapter gives a brief account of this information.
Electrical systems are subjected to mechanical and thermal stresses because of
short circuits.
Busbars, switchgear, and contactors can be destroyed. Due to the evolution of
heat, the operational equipment and the insulation of conductors and cables are
aﬀected. Furthermore, the potential hazards and injuries to the operating per-
sonnel must be considered.
In order to keep short circuits under control, these systems must be designed
and dimensioned so that the operational equipment is able to withstand short-
circuit conditions.
Here, the construction of the system components and the short-circuit current
strength are especially important. The short-circuit strength is the sum total of all
considerations for the prevention and control over the mechanical consequences
of short-circuit currents and the joule heating that results.
The amount of heat generated over the duration of the short circuit must not
exceed the permissible values for cables, conductors, and operational equipment.
13.1
Mechanical Short-Circuit Current Strength
Collecting bars, parallel conductors, switchgear, and fuses must be able to with-
stand the short circuit and the resulting peak short-circuit current occurring.
As a result of the magnetic ﬁeld generated, parallel conductors that are
separated by a distance attract each other when their currents ﬂow in the
same direction and repel each other when their currents ﬂow in the opposite
directions, whereby these forces are distributed uniformly over the length of the
conductors l.
The manufacturers of operational equipment test their products for normal
load conditions and for stability under the faulty operating conditions caused by

13 Mechanical and Thermal Short-Circuit Strength
a short circuit. At this point, it is useful to brieﬂy discuss the individual circuit
breakers and devices used in electrical systems:
• Circuit breakers: The rated short-circuit making and breaking capacities are
normally given by the manufacturer for the better assessment of short-circuit
strength. These speciﬁed numerical values must be larger than the calculated
short-circuit value of the short-circuit current at the location of the fault. The
contacts and mechanical parts must be able to withstand the short-circuit cur-
rent. The circuit breakers are provided for breaking overload and short-circuit
currents, for which the numerical values can be set accordingly. EN 60947 (IEC
947) describes the characteristics of low-voltage switches and IEC 282-1 and
IEC 17A the characteristics of high-voltage switches.
• Fuses: Fusible links are the oldest forms of protective equipment and are of
great importance in certain cases. The principle of these protective devices
is based on a rupture joint, for example, a piece of wire, which melts with
the application of a certain amount of heat given by ∫i2dt. The type of
time–current characteristic (function class) and the construction determine
the locations for use. They are often used as backup protection or as the main
protection in a system. The new version of IEC 269-1 describes the regulations
for all fuse types.
• Disconnectors, load interrupter switches, and load break switches: In the low-
voltage range, load interrupters are mostly used as disconnect switches for the
load circuits, which break only operating currents, that is, currents under nor-
mal load, with an inductive power factor of 0.7. These switches are not able
to break short-circuit currents and are, therefore, used together with fuses. In
contrast to load interrupter switches, load break switches, which produce a
visible isolating distance, are used in the medium-voltage range.
The operational equipment (busbars, insulators, wires, or cables) must be pro-
tected against the eﬀects of short-circuit currents), that is, the systems must be
short-circuit proof. The eﬀect of forces acting on conductors with current ﬂowing
is of great interest here. Figure 13.1 depicts the eﬀects of forces acting on busbars
and parallel conductors.
In the magnetic ﬁeld, a force acts on the conductors while the current is ﬂowing.
This force depends on the ﬂux density B, the current intensity I, and the length
l of the conductor. Two parallel conductors in which current is ﬂowing attract
each other when the currents are ﬂowing in the same direction and repel each
other when the currents are ﬂowing in the opposite directions.
F = B ⋅l ⋅I
This force is greatest for a double-phase short circuit without contact to
ground and for a three-phase short circuit. The maximum force occurring
between the two conductors is proportional to the square of the current, that
is, F ∼i2. The greatest force acting on the conductors is calculated from the
equation. For the current, the eﬀective peak short-circuit current ip is used.

The forces between the conductor elements in which a short-circuit current
ﬂows depend on the geometrical arrangement and the proﬁle of the conductors.
This is why eﬀective spacings have been introduced in the equation (EN 61660-1).
The eﬀective spacing am is determined from:
am = a
k12
The correction factor k12 is given in Figure 13.2.
As Figure 13.2 shows, the force is reduced because k12 < 1 for permanently
installed ﬂat (b/d > 1). On the other hand, the eﬀect of the force increases slightly
because k12 > 1 for neighboring bars.

The force leads to bending stress in rigid conductors, to tensile stress and
deﬂection in conducting cables, and to transverse loading, compressive loading,
or tensile loading of the support points. The conductors can be clamped,
supported, or a combination of both and have several support points. The short-
circuit loading of the busbars with respect to bending is calculated according to

The permissible total bending stress of the main (𝜎M) conductor and the con-

Thermal Short-Circuit Current Strength
Switches, conductors, and transformers must as a result of short-circuit cur-
rents be dimensioned with regard to thermal eﬀects as well. It must be checked
whether the thermal equilibrium short-time withstand current Ith is correctly
determined. The magnitude and the behavior in time of the short-circuit current
determine the eﬀective short-time withstand current, the eﬀective value of which
produces the same quantity of heat as the changing short-circuit current during
the duration of the short circuit TK in its d.c. aperiodic and a.c. periodic current
components.
The thermal short-circuit current can be calculated from the eﬀective value of
the initial symmetrical short-circuit current and the m and n factors (Figure 13.3).
Here:
Ith = I′′
k ⋅
√
m + n
(13.1)
We can also determine the factor m using the relationship:
m =
1
2f tk ln(𝜅−1)[e4 f Tk ln(𝜅−1) −1]
(13.2)
The factor m takes account of the thermal eﬀect of the d.c. aperiodic component
for three-phase and polyphase currents and the factor n the thermal eﬀect of the
a.c. periodic component for a three-phase short circuit.
Electrical operational equipment is dimensioned according to either the per-
missible short-time withstand current Ith or the permissible duration of the short
circuit TK.
The duration of the short circuit and the short-time withstand current are given
by the manufacturers of protective equipment.
Ith ≤Ithz
(13.3)
In accordance with IEC 76-1, Ith must not exceed 25 times the nominal cur-
rent for longer than 3 s with short-circuit current-limiting reactors. With current
transformers, this value is given on the nameplate. Here:
Ith ≤
√
Ikn
(TK + 0.05s)
(13.4)
For short-circuit durations:
TK ≥0.1s
(13.5)
the following relationship holds true:
Ia = I′′
k
(13.6)
If the peak short-circuit current ip is not known and the initial symmetrical
short-circuit current I′′
k is given, we can then calculate using the withstand ratio
𝜅= 1.8.

13.3
Limitation of Short-Circuit Currents
It is necessary to control both the minimum and the maximum short-circuit
currents in low-voltage systems without impairing the selectivity. Investigations
have shown that the three-phase short-circuit currents are less than 9 kA, with
an average value of 2.8 kA [18]. However, this value only applies for low-voltage
networks. In low-voltage networks, the single-phase short circuits are generally
less than 1 kA. In order to limit the short-circuit currents (Figure 13.5), special
measures are possible in individual systems according to the various operational
equipment.
Fuses are unsuitable for smaller short-circuit currents. This is why many power
supply companies prescribe line protection circuit breakers in house installa-
tions. The short-circuit current limitation in high-voltage and medium-voltage
networks can be achieved through economical (e.g., the choice of nominal net-
work voltage or division of the network into individual groups) and technical (e.g.,
the use of ip limiters and fuses) means.
Figures 13.6–13.11 illustrate the short-circuit-carrying capacity of diﬀerent
cables as a function of the break time.

Calculations for Short-Circuit Strength
To determine the short-circuit strength for switchgear and control gear,
the magnitude of the prospective short-circuit current is decisive.
The choice of switchgear follows from:
• the short-circuit strength
• the rated breaking capacity.
14.1
Short-Circuit Strength for Medium-Voltage
Switchgear
The following selection criteria are important for the short-circuit strength of
medium-voltage switchgear (EN 61936-1:2011-11):
• The rated short-circuit breaking current Isc: this is the eﬀective value of the
breaking current at the terminals of the switchgear. The following condition
must hold true:
Isc ≥I′′
k
(14.1)
Standardized values for middle-voltage systems are as follows:
8, 12.5, 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, and 63kA
• The rated short-circuit making current Ima: this is the peak value of the making
current for a short circuit at the terminals of the switchgear. The following
condition must apply for circuit breakers, load (break) switches, and grounding
switches of medium-voltage switchgear:
Ima ≥ip
(14.2)
Standardized values for medium-voltage systems are as follows:
20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80, 100, 125, and 160kA
• The rated short-time current Ith: this is the eﬀective value of the short-circuit
current which the switchgear can carry in the closed state during the rated
short-circuit duration tth under the speciﬁed conditions for use and operation.

14.2
Short-Circuit Strength for Low-Voltage Switchgear
The following selection criteria must be considered for the short-circuit strength
of low-voltage systems (IEC 60947):
• The rated ultimate short-circuit breaking current (breaking capacity) Icn: this
is the largest current which a switchgear can break without incurring damage.
It is given as an eﬀective value. Standardized values for low-voltage switchgear
are 18, 25, 40, 70, and 100 kA.
Icn ≥I′′
k
(14.5)
• The rated short-circuit making current (making capacity) Icm: this is the largest
current which a switchgear can make without incurring damage. It is given as a
peak value. The power factor cos 𝜙of the short-circuit path depends primarily
on the reactance of the input transformer. The greater its power, the smaller is
the power factor. For this relationship, IEC 60947-2 gives a minimum value for
circuit breakers:
Icm = n•Icn = 𝜅•
√
2•Icn
(14.6)
According to the type, the circuit breakers must be able to interrupt the follow-
ing short circuit and operating currents:
1) Circuit breakers with cos 𝜙≥0.1: short-circuit currents
2) Circuit breakers with cos 𝜙≥0.7: load currents
3) Circuit breakers with cos 𝜙< 0.1: operating currents.

14.2 Short-Circuit Strength for Low-Voltage Switchgear
187
• The rated short-time withstand current Icw: this is the permissible eﬀective
value of the a.c. periodic component of the uninﬂuenced short-circuit current
which the switchgear can carry for a certain length of time without any notice-
able eﬀect (e.g., due to excessive evolution of heat), for example, from 0.05 to
1 s.
In accordance with IEC 60947, circuit breakers are tested with two currents for
breaking the short-circuit current.
The Icu test sequence is 0–t–C0
The Ics test sequence is 0–t–C0–t–C0.
The current Ics represents the more severe condition for the circuit breakers,
because switching takes place one additional time and is stipulated as 25%, 50%,
75%, and 100% of Icu in order to distinguish the function of the switch following
a short-circuit break.
The symbols have the meaning:
Icu
rated short-circuit breaking current
I′′
k
initial symmetrical short-circuit current
Icm
rated short-circuit making current
ip
peak short-circuit current.

Equipment for Overcurrent Protection
Overcurrent protective devices are used in electrical power installations for the
control and protection of electrical equipment. The selection of these devices
is subject to the responsibilities and the processes in the plant. This chapter
describes the most important overcurrent short-circuit devices (Figure 15.1).
The time–current characteristics of limit switch fuses (Figure 15.2) are plotted
in logarithmic scale as a function of current. At higher short-circuit currents,
they break faster so that the peak short-circuit current ip can no longer occur.
The cut-oﬀcurrent is reached during the break process and can be obtained from
Figure 15.3.
The eﬀective current limitation and the very high breaking capacity are the
good features of these fuses. The cut-oﬀenergy or I2t values of the fuses are
decisive for the selectivity, which is normally guaranteed to be 1.6 times the
rated current (better is two times). The high voltage–high power fuses protect
the equipment and system components from the dynamic and thermal eﬀects
of short-circuit currents. The HH fuses are used in the distribution trans-
formers, high-voltage motors, capacitors, and middle-voltage transformers.
The combination of these fuses with load break switches, load switches, and
vacuum protectors is possible. Figures 15.4 and 15.5 show the time–current
characteristics and Figure 15.6 the cut-oﬀcharacteristics.
The miniature circuit breakers according to IEC 60898 (Figures 15.7 and 15.8)
are used in house installations and systems against overloading and short circuits.
Internationally, the characteristics B, C, and D are standardized. The function
values in the overload region are the same for all miniature circuit breakers, but in
the range of short circuits, the breaking current is a multiple of the rated current
for the breaker.
The assessment of capacity is according to the following criteria:
1) Rated breaking capacity 3, 6, 10, or 25 kA
2) Short-circuit stress and selectivity
3) Limiting class 1, 2, or 3
4) Backup protection.

The characteristics of circuit breakers are derived from IEC 60947 and are valid
for the cold state with a three-phase load for which in accordance with IEC 60898
the deviation from the release time from three times the current setting may be
a maximum of ±3%. In the warm operational state, the release times of the ther-
mal tripping devices are reduced by about 25%. The circuit breakers are compact
circuit breakers up to 63 A and function according to the principle of current
limitation. These devices are used for breaking and protecting motors, cables
and conductors, and other operational equipment with undelayed overcurrent

tripping devices and current-dependent overload tripping devices. The thermal
tripping device a is set to the rated current of the motor to be protected and the
magnetic tripping device n to 12 times the current (Figures 15.9 and 15.10).
For the protection of control transformers, the current is set 19 times. The
dependence of the rated short-circuit breaking capacity Icu and the rated service
short-circuit breaking capacity Icn on the rated current Ir and the rated normal
current Ir is taken from the respective manufacturer. Whether backup fuses
are required must be calculated from the prospective three-phase short-circuit
current.
The circuit breakers that protect the motors, cables and conductors, trans-
formers, and other system components satisfy the increased requirements for
overloading and short-circuit current protection. They are climatically stable and
suitable for operation in closed rooms in which no extreme operating condi-
tions (e.g., dust, caustic vapors, or aggressive gases) are present. Otherwise, metal
enclosing is required. Time–current characteristics of circuit breakers are shown
in Figure 15.11.
Protective functions and setting possibilities:
1) Current-dependent delayed overload tripping
The current setting Ie can be set to between 0.5 and 1 times the rated
switchgear current In in four steps.
2) Short-time delay release of short circuit
The pickup value Id can be set in seven steps between two and eight times the
value of Ir. The delay time can be selected between 0 and 500 ms and in some
cases higher. This allows a time selectivity.
3) Undelayed release of short circuit

Short-Circuit Currents in DC Systems
The most important power generator is the three-phase synchronous genera-
tor. Consequently, short-circuit currents in electrical networks are supplied from
the generator feed-ins. In power stations and in industry DC systems such as
DC motors, permanently installed lead batteries, smoothing capacitors, and con-
verter arms are frequently found. The short-circuit current calculation for these
systems is described in IEC 61660-1 and will be discussed brieﬂy here. This stan-
dard contains a method for the calculation of short-circuit currents in these sys-
tems [18]. However, it is also possible to use another method.
The short-circuit currents, pure resistances, and inductances can be measured
or obtained from model experiments. In DC systems, it is also necessary to dis-
tinguish between short-circuit currents of diﬀerent magnitudes:
1) The smallest short-circuit current is used as the basis for the selection of
overcurrent protection equipment. For the calculation of the smallest short-
circuit currents, we must consider under which circuit and operating condi-
tions the smallest short-circuit current ﬂows:
• The resistances of the conductors must be considered in relation to the
maximum operating temperature.
• The transition resistances must be considered.
• The short-circuit current of the current converter is the rated value of the
current limiting.
• The batteries are discharged by up to the discharge voltage of 1.8 V/cell,

• Diodes used to decouple power supply units must be considered.
2) The largest short-circuit current serves to dimension the electrical opera-
tional equipment. For the calculation of the largest short-circuit currents,
we must consider under which circuit and operating conditions the largest
short-circuit current ﬂows:
• The resistances of the conductors must be considered in relation to a tem-
perature of 20 ∘C.
• The transition resistances of the busbars can be neglected.

Power Flow Analysis
The calculation of networks is performed in stationary operations. The power
ﬂow analysis considers the active and reactive power ﬂows in a network of
predetermined infeed and loads. The power ﬂow enables network planning,
optimal network design with respect to voltage drop, and selection of cable
cross-sections. Further, network operation allows the economic and technical
point of optimal network management in the system.
A simple power ﬂow calculation speciﬁcally provides the following:
• node voltages and currents of the resources in terms of magnitude and phase
• active and reactive power ﬂows on the lines
• transmission losses in cables and transformers.
Electric power systems are complex, multiphase networks in which the capac-
itive and magnetic coupling exist, and in equivalent circuits, they are considered
by capacitances and mutual inductances. Mathematical modeling results then
coupled linear equations. To simplify the calculations, the multiphase system
was initially decoupled by a similarity transformation, thereby the task in the bal-
anced operation of calculating a single-phase network was reduced. Based on the
two Kirchhoﬀ’s laws, the mathematical models can be established in the form
of linear equations. They contain all known information on topology, branch
impedances, admittances, supply voltages, and loads. The solution delivers the
unknown branch currents and voltages. As a result, the current node process is
obtained, for example, the unknown node voltages, from their diﬀerences, the
branch voltages, and over the Ohm’s law, the branch currents. The mesh method
yields the mesh currents from which the branch current superimposes itself, and
through Ohm’s law, the branch voltages can be calculated. In weakly meshed net-
works, the mesh method has certain signiﬁcance. It provides a lower number of
equations and allows manual calculation of small networks. The majority of the
calculations are performed using Kirchhoﬀ’s current law (KCL) for networks on
the node process, which sets the predetermined or desired quantities in relation-
ship. Ohm’s current law leads to the so-called nodal admittance matrix, from
which the node hybrid matrix and the nodal impedance matrix can be derived.
According to the method, the analysis of a network node leads to a linear equation

system with the node voltages as unknown and the loads as input variables. The
elements of the associated node matrix are the admittances of the network.
The analytical calculation of the three-phase systems based on simpliﬁcations
leads to real solutions. This procedure is described in low-voltage power systems
and even in medium-power systems. However, high-voltage power systems and
a large part of medium-voltage networks are strongly intermeshed with very dif-
ferent line impedances between nodes. Therefore, complex calculations are per-
formed. An important characteristic of a meshed network with lines and nodes
(without the reference node) is the degree of meshing [14].
For the load ﬂow calculation of the individual network nodes, speciﬁcations on
the type of loads need to be made. These nodes are divided into load or consumer
nodes and feed or generator nodes. At least one node, the slack node, is available
where the voltage magnitude and angle are set. At this node, active and reactive
power is set up so that a balance exists in all networks between the feed-in and
detached services. The slack node must be able to take over the allocated power
account. The system of equations is not linear because the power depends on the
square of the voltage. For load ﬂow calculation, an iteration process can be used
for solving the nonlinear system of equations.
17.1
Systems of Linear Equations
For the solution of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations, a variety of diﬀerent
methods are available, which diﬀer by storage space, speed, accuracy, and pro-
gramming. We diﬀerentiate between the direct and iterative processes. Iterative
methods are used in solving the nonlinear equations [20, 21].
A distinction is made between the current iteration with the Gauss–Seidel
method and the Newton–Raphson method.
In the following description, an introductory overview of the methods
employed in the power calculation is introduced.
First, consider the following equation system:
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 = y1
a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 = y2
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 = y3
.

am1x1 + am2x2 + amnx3 = ym
The variables include the designations:
x1, x2, x3: unknowns
a11, a12, a13,…, a33:coeﬃcients of the variables
y1, y2, y3: known parameters.
We summarize the coeﬃcients aij of the linear system to a coeﬃcient matrix A,
the unknown variables x1, x2, x3 to a column vector x, and absolute variables y1,

(17.2)
The m⋅n matrix describes a matrix with m rows (row vectors) and n columns
(column vectors).
Equation (17.1) can be written as:
A x = y
(17.3)
Special cases to note:
For row matrix: m = 1 A [1, n] = A[n]
For column matrix: n = 1 A [m, 1] = A[m].
If m = n, A is an n × n square matrix.
A = A[m, m] =

(17.4)
The matrix A is of the order m. The elements for which the matrix rows and
columns are identical, i = j, are called the main diagonal elements. All other ele-
ments for which the matrix rows and columns are not identical, i ≠j, are called
non-diagonal elements or adjacent diagonal elements.
If we multiply square matrices A and B, a unit matrix E is obtained:
A ⋅B = E
(17.5)
Or, the inverse of the matrices A:
B = A−1
(17.6)
17.2
Determinants
A matrix can assign a certain number, namely, its determinant. For example, we
need it in the implementation of multidimensional extreme value tasks where
we have to look exactly like the one-dimensional case, if the calculated second
derivative is positive. The second derivative will be given in the form of a matrix,
and some kind of positivity matrices will be needed. This is not easy, and one can
use determinants to solve linear equations.
For the introduction of the concept of determinants, we consider a system of
linear equations with two equations and two unknowns as:
(1)
a11x1 + a12x2 = b1
(2)
a21x1 + a22x2 = b2
(17.7)

210
17 Power Flow Analysis
It is to be examined under which preconditions this equation system has a
unique solution, exactly one solution.
Thus, Equation (17.1) is multiplied by a22 and Equation (17.2) by a12, and all
equations are added.
(1)
a11x1 + a12x2 = b1 ⋅a22
(2)
a21x1 + a22x2 = b2 ⋅a12
(17.8)
a11a22x1 + a12a22x2 = b1 ⋅a22
a21a12x1 + a12a22x2 = b2 ⋅a12
(17.9)
Now, subtract the second equation from the ﬁrst. Then:
(a11a22 −a12a21)x1 = b1 ⋅a22 −b2a12
(a11a22 −a12a21)x2 = b2 ⋅a11 −b1a21
(17.10)
If the expression in brackets is not zero, it follows the solution:
x1 = b1 ⋅a22 −b2a12
a11a22 −a12a21
x2 = b2 ⋅a11 −b1a21
a11a22 −a12a21
(17.11)
If Equation (7) is written in a coeﬃcient matrix, then:
A =
[a11
a12
a21
a22
]
(17.12)
Thus, there is a denominator by “crossover multiplying” the matrix entries, and
it is called the determinant of A, and the second order is denoted and deﬁned by
the following:
det A = det
[a11
a12
a21

17.2 Determinants
211
Where a11a22 is the main diagonal and a12a21 is the oﬀ-diagonal. Therefore, there
is a solution formula that allows a clear notation for systems of equations with two
equations and two unknowns. Each solution is the quotient of two determinants,
where the denominator is always the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix A is
in counter the jth solution, just xj is the jth column of A by the right side
(

)

replaced.
However, systems of equations have more than two unknowns, which is why
we determine for n × n matrices. Consequently, one should be able to solve linear
equations of third-order determinants, such as
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 = b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 = b2
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 = b3

In this section, the problem of linear and nonlinear equations in power systems
was discussed, and the calculation methods were introduced. Cramer’s rule is an
especially helpful application in the power systems to solve networks. The next
section deals with network matrices.
17.3
Network Matrices
In this section, the methods of admittance matrix, impedance matrix, and hybrid
matrix will be discussed [14, 22].
17.3.1
Admittance Matrix
Figure 17.1 shows a network section with the nodes i and k and the reference
point 0. Each node is associated with each node voltage. The load current in a
node is denoted by Iii.
We look at the nodal point i, which is connected with other nodes n of the
network. The node rule speciﬁes that:
n
∑
k=0
Iik = Ii0 + Ii1 + Ii2 + · · · + Iii + · · · + Iin = 0
(17.26)
The currents in the branches:
Iik = −Y ik ⋅(Ui −Uk)
Y i0 ⋅(Ui −U0) + Y i1 ⋅(Ui −U1) + · · · + Iii + · · · + Y in ⋅(Ui −Un) = 0
(17.27)
If multiplied and summarized, the equation is as follows:
Ui(Y i0 + Y i1 + · · · + Y in) −Y i0U0 −Y i1U1 −· · · −Y in ⋅Un = −Iii (17.28)
The equation is multiplied by (−1) and ordered by indices of voltages, which
are then given by nodes’ equation of the node i:
Y i0U0 + Y i1U1 + Y i2U2 + · · · + Y iiUi + · · · + Y inUn = Iii

In vector notation:

(17.32)
Y represents the square admittance matrix (coeﬃcient matrix), U represents
the vector of node voltages, and I represents the vector of nodal currents.
17.3.2
Impedance Matrix
The impedance matrix provides the inverse matrix Z = Y−1 of the admittance
matrix and corresponds to a complete exchange of variables. Then, the matrix
equation of a network is
Z ⋅I = U
(17.33)
The impedance matrix allows the direct calculation of node voltages given by
multiplication node currents with the matrix elements. In a voltage vector, the
diﬀerences of the individual node voltages Ui to node voltage U0 of the reference
node can be seen. The main application of the hybrid and the impedance matrices
is located in the short-circuit and power ﬂow calculation. This method allows a
faster convergence of iterative solution but needs very large storage requirements
since all elements are diﬀerent from zero.
The resolution of Equation (17.33) to the node voltages leads to the equation
system with the node impedance matrix Z, which is in matrix form:

Hybrid Matrix
In the calculation of electrical networks at diﬀerent nodes, diﬀerent sizes are

other node currents. In these, the admittance matrix is reshaped so that all known
sizes in the column vector occur and that all required quantities to the right-hand
side of the equal sign form a column. This is reached by the partial inversion of
the matrix. The principles will be explained brieﬂy.

rical. Submatrices are determined by
H11 = −A−1

H22 = −A21A−1

The calculation of a hybrid matrix is tedious and time consuming. Therefore,
this method will not be explained further.

Figure 17.2 shows a single-line diagram for a simple case of the calculation of
node voltage and node currents by knowing the load current and node power.

Respectively,
Y ⋅U = I
(17.32)
We get voltage by inversion of Y:
U = Y−1 ⋅I
(17.39)
The outgoing line current from node i:
Iik = Y ik ⋅(Ui −Uk) + Ui ⋅Y i0(k)
(17.40)
With this current, the power ﬂow can be calculated from i to k:
Sik = Ui ⋅I∗

(17.41)
17.3.5
Calculation of Node Voltages at Predetermined Node Power
The problem of a constant power is that it always leads to an iterative solution
of power ﬂow equations. For ﬁrst approximation, the current is calculated with a
voltage from the power relation:
Iii =

(17.43)
By the iteration, a start vector of nodal currents is calculated from an estimated
node voltage vector U(0) and the known node power S.
An improved voltage vector U(1) can be calculated accurately using an inverted
admittance matrix with the initial vector I(0).
U(1) = Y−1 ⋅I(0)
(17.44)
17.3.6
Calculation of Power Flow
The design of networks, both in normal operation and under fault conditions,
is of great interest. The dimensioning of the electrical equipment in considera-
tion of the transferred services, the cross-sections, the voltage diﬀerences, and
short-circuit currents is carried out with simpler equations by hand or with the
aid of computer programs. The magnitude of the networks and the large number
of systems of equations of the networks make it impossible to repeatedly set up
new programs. The power distribution is often unknown and must be determined
beforehand.
The load ﬂow calculation is an important part of the electric power supply. The
objective is to determine the voltages and power at all nodes of magnitude and
phase as well as the utilization of all network elements in the system.
The power direction is chosen in the consumer system. Here, the inﬂowing in a
resource active power and inductive reactive power counted positively. The load
ﬂow calculation is assumed that the system is constructed in a stationary and
symmetrical way. In this section, the basic designs of the load ﬂow calculations
will be explained.

17 Power Flow Analysis
17.3.6.1
Type of Nodes
In the load ﬂow calculation, three diﬀerent network nodes can be distinguished:
Slack node: At this node, only the voltage (amplitude and phase system) is spec-
iﬁed. The slack node covers the power diﬀerence, after the current and voltage
distribution results.
Load nodes: The complex power is speciﬁed, which is constant during the cal-
culation (PQ-node). Moreover, the behavior of the consumers has to be observed
at a change of voltage (constant current and constant impedance).
Node generator: The amplitude of the voltage and the active power are ﬁxed
(PU-node). In many cases, the boundaries of the reactive power must be taken
into consideration, arising from the operation diagram of the generator.
17.3.6.2
Type of Loads and Complex Power
At a certain load condition, the following questions must be answered:
1) Which loads are connected to the node?
2) What is the line and transformer load throughout the system?
3) What is the voltage stability in the whole system?
To answer these questions, the reproduction of loads will be considered
(Figure 17.3).
For each node, the complex power in sinusoidal steady-state circuits can be
deﬁned as:
ik = Ak ⋅uk
(17.45)
The complex voltage vector uk can be split into a real and imaginary part:
uk = ek + jfk = uk ⋅cos 𝜑k + juk ⋅sin 𝜑k

Correspondingly, we get the elements of a node admittance matrix:
aij = gij + jbij
(17.47)
The apparent power can be given for each node:
Si = Ui ⋅I∗
i = Pi + jQi
(17.48)
For all other elements:
SGi = SLi + STi
(17.49)
SGi = PGi + jQGi
(17.50)
SLi = PLi + jQLi
(17.51)
STi = PTi + jQTi
(17.52)
Ui = Ui ⋅ej𝜑i
(17.53)
The node types are as follows:
a) Load node (e.g., motors, loads, and pipes) (PQ-node)
Given ∶P and Q;
wanted ∶U and 𝛿
b) Infeed node (e.g., mains’ supplies and generators) (PU-node)
Given ∶P and U;
wanted ∶Q and 𝛿
c) Balance sheet or reference node (slack node)
Given ∶U and 𝛿;
wanted ∶P and Q
The load modeling plays a very important role. Several consumers are grouped
into a load. They can be emulated by the following variables:
• constant impedances
• constant currents
• constant performance
• voltage-dependent services.
Measurements have shown the voltage dependence of the loads with the
equations:
Pi = Pi0 ⋅
( Ui
Ui0
)p
(17.54)
Qi = Qi0 ⋅
( Ui
Ui0
)q
(17.55)
Substituting p and q with the values 0, 1, and 2, the measured exponents are
p = q = 0: load with constant power
p = q = 1: load as a constant current
p = q = 2: load as a constant impedance.

The method of the load modeling is based on the calculation of the correc-
tions for the node voltages. To solve the nonlinear equations, diﬀerent iterations
are used.
The Newton–Raphson method has proven it in practice. Therefore, the math-
ematical formulation is discussed in more detail in the next section.
17.3.8
Load Flow Calculation by Newton–Raphson
The power equation is used by the Newton–Raphson method. This is obtained
from the current equation of the KCL node methods, in which ﬁrst conjugated
this complex and then multiplied on the left by the factor 3 and a diagonal matrix
U multiplied by the node voltages as elements.

220
17 Power Flow Analysis
3 ⋅U ⋅Y ⋅u∗= 3 ⋅U ⋅i∗= s + jq
(17.63)
The power is deﬁned for each node i:
Si = Pi + jQi = Ui ⋅Ii
∗
(17.64)
ik = Ak ⋅uk
(17.65)
And then:
sk = diag(uk) ⋅i∗
k
and
sk = diag(uk) ⋅A∗
ku∗
k
(17.66)
Substituting for the node voltages:
Ui = Ei + jF
(17.67)
And the elements of the node admittance matrix:
aik = gik −jbik
(17.68)
for each node
Pi + jQi = (Ei + jFi) ⋅
n
∑
k=1
(gik + jbik) ⋅(Ek −jFk)
(17.69)
The division into the real and imaginary parts results in the following:
Pi =
n
∑
k=1
[Ei(Ekgik + Fkjbik) + Fi(Fkgik −Ekjbik)]
(17.70)
Qi =
n
∑
k=1
[Fi(Ekgik + Fkjbik) −Ei(Fkgik −Ekjbik)]
(17.71)
Thus, the complex load ﬂow equations have been split into two real systems.
For each node, there are two equations. At each node, the active and reactive
power are given. Calculation is performed for the real and imaginary parts of the
voltages at all nodes except for the slack nodes. There, the voltage is known and
held in its size and phase position. The equation system with 2(n−1) must be
solved to get the load ﬂow in a network with n nodes.
The Newton–Raphson method requires the setting of a system equation that
changes sets in the active and reactive power in relation to changes in node volt-
ages. The following is applied:

The coeﬃcient matrix is called the Jacobian matrix, which is deﬁned as a matrix
in which the elements are the partial representative derivatives of the indepen-
dent variable. The Jacobian matrix oﬀers a breakdown into four partial matrices.

whereby:

and

(17.74)
From
the

Pi = ∑n
k=1[Ei(Ekgik + Fkjbik) + Fi(Fkgik −Ekjbik)],
the

∑

(17.75)
For the calculation of the elements of the matrix H, the active power needs to be
diﬀerentiated according to the real part of voltages. One can distinguish between
main diagonal elements and oﬀ-diagonal elements. The main diagonal elements
are as follows:
ΔPi
𝜕Ei
= 2Eigii + Fibii −Fibii +
n
∑
k=1
k≠i
(Ekgik + Fkbik)
(17.76)
For the oﬀ-diagonal elements k ≠1:
ΔPi

(17.77)
Accordingly, the elements of the submatrix N can be obtained:
ΔPi
𝜕Fi
= Eibii + 2Figii −Eibii +

∑
k=1

(Fkgik −Fkbik)
(17.78)
For the oﬀ-diagonal elements k ≠1:
ΔPi

(17.79)
If the equation Qi = ∑n
k=1[Fi(Ekgik + Fkjbik) −Ei(Fkgik −Ekjbik)] is rewritten,
the following is obtained:
Qi = Fi(Eigii + Fibii) −Ei(Figii −Eibii)
+
n
∑
k=1
k≠1
[Fi(Ekgik + Fkbik) −Ei(Fkgik −Ekbik)]
(17.80)
Thus, the elements of the submatrices J and L can be determined. For the main
diagonal elements of J, the following is obtained:

The simpliﬁed mathematical description of the Newton–Raphson method is
shown in Figure 17.6. The complex system of equations can be split into two real
components (real and imaginary parts of the voltages at all nodes). The so-called
slack node or node compensation is not considered here, since the voltage is
known and held in its size and phase position. The nominal voltages at the nodes,
or the rated voltage of the generator nodes, are taken as initial values for the volt-
ages and determined.

The active and reactive power at the nodes are calculated and determined. If the
deviation is less than a predetermined threshold, then the iteration is terminated,
and the load ﬂow can be calculated in the entire network. Otherwise, the node
currents are determined from the currently calculated performance that deter-
mines the Jacobian method, and a corrected voltage vector is formed so that new
values can be formed at the nodes. This is continued until the end of the iteration.
A second possibility is that the load ﬂow equations can be set up as a function
of the voltage magnitude and angle magnitude.
17.3.9
Current Iteration
A distinction is made in the power ﬂow calculation between the current itera-
tion and the Newton–Raphson method. The former is prepared from the given
node active power S1, S2, S3, … , Sn using an estimated starting vector for the node
voltages (U1, U2, U3, … , Un and currents I1, I2, I3, … , In calculated), from which
ﬁnally by solving a linear system of equations for given load currents Y ⋅U = I
iteratively improved node voltages are calculated. In the second calculation step,
replacing the initial vector of node voltages by the calculated, improved node volt-
ages and receives there again new, improved load currents and node voltages, and
so on. By the Newton–Raphson method, the node voltages are iteratively deter-
mined directly from the power of their ﬁrst derivatives.
17.3.9.1
Jacobian Method
The Jacobian method for current iteration is called a total step process, where
the whole equation is determined in each step for a ﬁxed node voltage vector.
The equation for the voltage Ui can be solved for each node i, and the following

224
17 Power Flow Analysis
can be written as follows:
Y i1 ⋅U1 + Y i2 ⋅U2 + Y ii ⋅Ui + · · · + Y in ⋅Un = Iii

Gauss–Seidel Method
The Gauss–Seidel method for current iteration is called a single-step process. The
already iterated equations obtained from the improved node voltages are consid-
ered in the iteration of the subsequent rows of equations, which result in faster
convergence leads. One divides the square parenthesized sum into two subtotals
and uses in the ﬁrst, the already improved node voltages.

Newton–Raphson Method
The Newton–Raphson method is used extensively in the electrical power systems
to solve power ﬂows. It has a great assurance of convergence and speed. The idea
is that we approximate a graph of f by suitable tangents. Using an approximate
value x0 obtained from the graph of f , x1 is the point of intersection of the x-axis
and then the tangent to the curve of f at x0 (Figure 17.7).

The nonlinear equation is developed into a Taylor series and is then dissolved
by x. The following applies
f (x) = f (x0) + 1
1!
df (x0)
dx
(x −x0) + 1
2!
df (x1)
dx
(x −x0) + · · · = 0
(17.97)
f (x) = f (x0)+ 1
1!f ′(x(0))(x −x0)+ · · · = f (x(0))+ f ′(x(0))Δx(0) + · · · (17.98)
Δx(0) = (x −x0) ≈−f (x(0))
f ′(x(0)) = −[ f ′(x(0))]−1 ⋅f (x(0))
(17.99)
The solution of the linearized problem and iteration rule give
x ≈x(0) + Δx(0) = x(0) −[ f ′(x(0))]−1 ⋅f (x(0))
Δx(0) = −[ f ′(x(0))]−1 ⋅f (x(0))
(17.100)
For any particular iteration, the following is obtained:
x(j+1) = x(j) + Δx(j) = x(j) −[ f ′(x(j))]−1 ⋅f (x(j))
(17.101)
During an iteration, each value of Δx(x) will be determined and added to the
last approximation. The next question is how to apply this with n equations and
n unknowns. Again, the function f (x) is expanded in a Taylor series as follows:
f (x(0) + Δx(0)) = f (x(0)) + f ′(x(0))Δx(0) + 1
2f ′′(x(0))(Δx(0))2 + · · · = 0
(17.102)
Taking the second term to the right-hand side, the following can be written as
follows:
f (x(0) + Δx(0)) = f (x(0)) + f ′(x(0))Δx(0) = 0
(17.103)

(17.104)
In Equation (17.103), taking f (x(0)) to the right-hand side, the following is
obtained:
f ′(x(0))Δx(0) = −f (x(0))
(17.105)
Or, in terms of the Jacobian matrix J, the following is obtained:
JΔx(0) = −f (x(0))
(17.106)
Finally, solving Equation (17.103) for Δx(0), the following is given:
Δx(0) = −[ f ′(x(0))]−1f (x(0)) = −J−1f (x(0))
(17.107)
Equation (17.55) provides the basis for the update formula to be used in the
ﬁrst iteration of the multidimensional case. This update formula is
x(1) = x(0) + Δx(0) = x(0) −J−1f (x(0))
(17.108)
And, from Equation (17.107), the update formula for any particular iteration
can be inferred as:
x(i+1) = x(i) + Δx(i) = x(i) −J−1f (x(i))
(17.109)
Matrix inversion must be avoided because of high-dimensional problems and
large-scale power networks, and matrix inversion is very time consuming. To do
this, Equation (17.109) is written as:
x(i+1) = x(i) + Δx(i)
(17.110)
Where Δx(i) is found from
−JΔx(i) = f (x(i))
(17.111)
Equation (17.111) is simply the linear matrix equation because Δx(i) is an n × 1
vector of unknowns and f (x(i)) is an n × 1 vector of knowns. J is just a constant
n × n matrix.

Power Flow Analysis in Low-Voltage Power Systems
The calculation of a three-phase system with the aim of determining the
distribution of active and reactive power on the individual lines and nodes and

17.3 Network Matrices
227
determining the node voltages is called load ﬂow calculation. This calculation
requires special considerations at diﬀerent voltage levels. In low-voltage power
systems, many single-phase and three-phase consumers may occur, mostly with
an ohmic-inductive load. In industrial networks, however, the motor loads are
very common. A mixed load is available in public networks. The planning and
installation of an electrical system requires the precise calculation of the power
demands for which the system is to be designed. This is determined by the
equation:
Pm =
n
∑
i=1
Pi
(17.113)
where
Pi = n ⋅gi ⋅PL
(17.114)
If a Gaussian (normal) distribution is assumed for the coincidence, then the
coincidence function can be calculated as:
gn = g∞+ 1 −g∞
√
2
(17.115)
Often this value can be given approximately for ﬂats by the context of [16]
g = 0.07 + 0.93
n
(17.116)
The coincidence factor or demand factor gi indicates how many consumers
are in operation at the same time. It is an important factor for determining the
feed-ins. n is the number of connections or residential units. When more motor
drives are connected in the system, it is also necessary to consider the utilization
factor ai and the eﬃciency 𝜂i in the calculation.
The main interest of load ﬂow calculation in distribution is usually to determine
the maximum branch currents, power losses, and maximum voltage drop. In
low-voltage power systems, the R/X ratio is considerably greater than 1. The volt-
age drop, therefore, depends mainly on the active power ﬂow. Reactive power ﬂow
in low-voltage systems is of less interest. A realistic representation of the loads
results from modeling the problem. Temporal changes are usually simulated by
load curves, which represent the time course of a load in the course of a day. If the
load curves are entered only once, it is possible to perform a load ﬂow calculation
for any point in time or even to start sequential load ﬂow calculations in which any
size can be recorded as a function of time of day. This type of load ﬂow calculation
allows for a very accurate estimation of line loads or voltage levels [11].
In low-voltage power systems, the calculation of power ﬂows is not necessary in
many cases. In particular, the dimensioning of conductor sizes, voltage drop, and
single-phase and three-phase short-circuit calculations are most important for
the engineers. This entire topic is not the subject of this book, but it is presented
extensively in other literature [7].

Protection by cut oﬀis the most important condition for satisfying the pro-
tective measures up to 1000 V. In accordance with IEC 60364, Part 41, the faults
must be protected by cut oﬀwithin 0.4 s for portable equipment of Protection
Class I and in 5 s for permanently installed operational equipment. The cut-oﬀ
currents of fuses and power breakers can be found in tables and diagrams (see
IEC 60364, Part 43 and Part 600).
In this example, the cut-oﬀcurrents Ia have the values:

Ia = 5 ⋅In = 5 ⋅16A = 80A

The cut-oﬀcurrent of a 16-A circuit breaker is 80 A. Since the single-pole
short-circuit current is greater than the cut-oﬀcurrent, the cut-oﬀcondition is
satisﬁed.

Systems
For the selection and project management of electrical systems, it is necessary
to check the short-current strength of the operational equipment against the
mechanical and thermal stresses resulting from short circuits. This assumes the
knowledge required for calculating short-circuit currents. In this section, the
short-circuit currents are calculated and the operational equipment is dimen-
sioned. After calculating the required short-circuit currents, it must be assessed
whether the protection during indirect contact and stability against short circuits
is ensured.
Tables 18.2–18.5 summarize the calculated short-circuit currents for Example
1 of this chapter.

In accordance with IEC 60909:

The requirement is therefore satisﬁed.
Calculation of positive-sequence short-circuit impedances for the transformer:
The following data can be taken from the nameplate of the transformer:
11 000 V ± 16% in 13 steps (27 settings), 21, 31.5/110 kV.
Maximum setting (step 1):
Zk = 68.8Ω,
ITpV = 124.5∕181A,
UTpV = 127.6kV

18.15 Example 15: Proof of the Stability of Medium-Voltage and High-Voltage Systems
261
Middle setting (step 14 m):
Zk = 46.7Ω,
ITpV = 165.3∕209.9A,
UTpV = 110kV
Minimum setting (step 27):
Zk = 30.7Ω,
ITpV = 196.8∕249.9A,
UTpV = 92.4kV
Here, it is necessary to clarify whether, in accordance with IEC 60909, the calcu-
lation can be performed only with the middle position. The following relationship
holds true:
UTpV = UnTpV(1 ± pT)
pT is obtained from the relationship:
pT = 0.16 > 0.05
The step incrementation must be chosen so that the largest short-circuit cur-
rent occurs. The transformation ratio is

Calculation of cable impedances:
The following cable data [8] are given: N2XS(F)2Y 1 × 300 Rm/25, 18/20 kV:
From the resistance per unit length of the cable, we can calculate the resistance
of the cable:
R′ = 0.0601Ω∕km ⋅30m ⋅
km
1000 m = 1.8mΩ and with the inductance per unit
length of the cable L′ = 0.347mH∕km, we can calculate the inductance of the
cable:
X′ = 2𝜋⋅50Hz ⋅0.347mH∕km = 109mΩ∕km 30m = 3.27mΩ
Overland lines:
The overland lines are of type Al/St 537/53 mm2. Due to the large cross-section,
the resistances expected can be neglected.
Calculation of short-circuit currents for diﬀerent fault locations:
For the dimensioning of the operational equipment, the short-circuit currents
are calculated according to Figure 18.19. First, a three-pole short circuit with sim-
ple input through parallel current paths is calculated.

Here, we can neglect Rk.

1265mΩ + 1.09mΩ + 1.09mΩ

Rk = 0.02294 ⋅Xk < 0.3Xk
Here again, we can neglect Rkk. For the calculation of the initial symmetrical
short-circuit current, we use the reactances.

The initial symmetrical short-circuit current results from the parallel current
branches as follows:

The same conditions, therefore, apply for the peak short-circuit, cut-oﬀ, and
steady-state short-circuit currents. We can then determine the transferred
short-circuit current for the ﬁrst branch by rewriting the equations:

For branch 2:

k-branch2 = I′′
k −I′′
k-branch1 = 18.014kA −9.015kA = 8.999kA
Determination of the peak short-circuit current for branch 1:
𝜅1 = 1.02 + 0.98 ⋅e−3(R∕X) = 1.02 + 0.98 ⋅e−3⋅0.02203 = 1.937
ip-branch1 = 1.937 ⋅
√
2 ⋅I′′
k-branch1 = 1.937 ⋅

2 ⋅9.015kA = 24.7kA
Determination of the peak short-circuit current for branch 2:
𝜅2 = 1.02 + 0.98 ⋅e−3(R∕X) = 1.02 + 0.98 ⋅e−3⋅0.02294 = 1.935
ip-branch1 = 1.935 ⋅
√
2 ⋅I′′
k-branch1 = 1.937 ⋅
√
2 ⋅8.999kA = 24.6kA
The total peak short-circuit current is the sum of the currents in branches 1
and 2:
ip = ip-branch1 + ip-branch2 = 49.32kA
Here, it must be noted that the transferred short-circuit current per cable
branch is only one-third of the calculated current.

Stability of operational equipment against short circuits:

dynamic (ip) and the thermal (Ith) stresses.
For far-from-generator short circuits:

and
therefore n = 1
In accordance with IEC 60909, we obtain for the thermal eﬀect of the direct
current (d.c.) aperiodic component m:
m =

2f Tk ln(𝜅−1)[e4f Tk ln(𝜅−1) −1]

m =

2 ⋅50Hz ⋅1s ⋅ln(1.94 −1)[e4⋅50 Hz⋅Tk⋅ln(1.94−1) −1] = 0.162

Dimensioning of the operational equipment:
The calculations (Table 18.7) are summarized in this section in order to make
these available for dimensioning. For the dimensioning, the following operat-
ing conditions are assumed (Table 18.8). The standard value of the network fre-
quency is 50 Hz, and the rated short-circuit duration Tk is assumed to be 1 s.
The protection technology must be designed and set up in accordance with this.
The dimensioning of the circuit breaker is taken from IEC 282 (Table 18.9). The
rated short-circuit making current of the circuit breaker must be 2.5 times as
large as the eﬀective value of the rated short-circuit breaking current. If the peak
short-circuit current is above 2.5 times this value, then the rated making current
must have at least the value of the peak short-circuit current.
Table 18.10 gives the rated currents of the load interrupter switches. The rated
steady-state current of the load interrupter switch is dimensioned according to
the steady-state operating current.
The dimensioning of the disconnect switch and the grounding switch follows
IEC 282 (Table 18.11).

Dimensioning of the overvoltage surge arrester:
The dimensioning of the overvoltage surge arrester is accomplished with the
help of IEC 60099-5 (1996). The use of a silicon carbide surge arrester is preferred
in ground fault neutralizer grounded systems and is connected to the transformer
between the conductors and ground. The required quenching voltage and its
rated discharge current must be considered during dimensioning. With the load
rejection factor 𝛿L = 1.1, the quenching voltage is

18 Examples: Calculation of Short-Circuit Currents
In accordance with IEC 60099-5 (1996), the quenching voltage of 138 kV is cho-
sen. A 10-kA arrester is recommended for the choice of arresters in accordance
with the rated discharge current for networks with >60 kV. The stability against
short circuits must be dimensioned, so that the short-circuit strength remains
ensured at currents higher than the expected initial symmetrical short-circuit
current.
Dimensioning of the current inverter:
The dimensioning of the current inverter follows from the short-circuit cur-
rent to be expected, in order to ensure that the transformer does not become
quickly saturated and the protection relays are no longer able to correctly sense
the short-circuit current. The standard values in accordance with IEC 44-1 are as
follows: 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 75, and their decimal multiples or divisions. Here, the
standard value 30 is chosen.
Dimensioning of the voltage transformer:
The standard values are provided in IEC 44-2. The information applies to
inductive and capacitive transformers. The rated network voltage is the essential
parameter for dimensioning. For conductor–conductor voltage transformers,
110 kV and a conductor–ground voltage transformer 110 kV
√

must be selected.
The rated voltage factors are obtained from IEC 44-2.
Dimensioning of the 20-kV switchgear:
1) Dimensioning of the supply line:
• For the dimensioning of the conductors, the three-pole short circuit is used
as the basis.
• For the loading of the shielding, the neutral point connection and the asym-
metrical short-circuit currents are of greatest importance. The maximum
short-circuit current is calculated as the double ground fault.
2) Dimensioning of the circuit breakers:
The electrical data for the circuit breakers from the manufacturers’ catalogs are
compared with the data measured (Table 18.12). At this point an example will
