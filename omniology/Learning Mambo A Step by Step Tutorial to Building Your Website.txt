through illness to review the chapters. For the record, I believe he 
was already ill before starting to read. Thanks also to everyone 
at Packt involved with the book, for putting up with my random 
schedule and seeing to it safely into print. Finally, I would like to 
acknowledge the co-operation of Otto Simplex and everyone at 
Zak Springs Golf Club. I do hope they manage to catch the strange, 
shambling creature haunting their back nine.

Preface
Mambo is a free tool to manage the content of dynamic websites. To be more specific, 
Mambo is an open-source content management system, written in the PHP scripting 
language which is probably the most popular and straightforward language for 
creating websites and web applications. Mambo allows you to create a powerful, 
dynamic website with minimum effort and programming knowledge.
As one of the most popular applications on the Internet, Mambo has grown into a 
complex, powerful tool with an impressive range of features, and a loyal community 
of supporters.
This book targets the 4.6 release of Mambo, and it'll take you through creating an 
example website. The book is packed with practical steps for you to learn how to 
build your own website, beginning with a discussion of the requirements for the 
example site. The site unfolds as you progress through the chapters, learning more 
about Mambo.
What This Book Covers
Chapter 1 introduces us to Mambo, and what it can do for us. The chapter concludes 
with a discussion of the Zak Springs Golf Club example site, including a list of the 
requirements for the site.
Chapter 2 takes you through installing Mambo on a local machine for 
development purposes.
In Chapter 3, we take our first look at the main elements of a Mambo site, meeting 
menus, modules, components, templates, and having a quick look at the arrangement 
of content on a Mambo site. We also take our first steps in the administration area, and 
are introduced to the important concepts of publishing and access restrictions, and the 
HTML editor that will be used to enter most of the content on our site. We conclude 
the chapter with some basic changes to the front page of the site.

Preface
[  ]
We start our Zak Springs example site in Chapter 4 by creating a fresh, empty 
installation of Mambo. Then we look at the fundamental configuration options 
available to our site, such as setting up the system to send mail. We also take a look 
at the Private Messages component in this chapter, which provides us with a quick 
test of our mail server setup.
Chapter 5 continues the theme of site configuration, by looking at module and 
component management. These are the main functional elements of your site, and 
in the chapter we look first at module management, choosing how and where, and 
on which pages to display them. We walk through the creation of simple RSS and 
HTML modules from the administration area. To get modules and components 
into your Mambo system there is a "Universal Installer", that allows you to 
effortlessly install any kind of Mambo add-on. In the chapter we download and 
install a third-party calendar add-on. We also have a look at managing media, 
whereby you can upload resources such as images or documents directly onto the 
Mambo server, to be used in your content.
Chapter 6 is about menus and templates. Without menus, visitors would have great 
difficulty in finding anything on your site. A menu is made up of menu items. Menu 
items point to pages on your site, and also define how the target page should be 
displayed. In the chapter we walk through creating menu items. We also consider 
the different types of menu items that are available, and the consequences of these 
choices for the target page. Templates control the look and feel of your site. A new 
look for your site can be selected by assigning a new template. We look at the basics 
of managing templates in this chapter, including how to apply different templates to 
different pages on the site, so that your site does not look "uniform".
Your site is created for people to visit, and in Chapter 7, we walk through the basics 
of managing user accounts. Visitors are able to create an account on your site, and 
in this chapter, we look at what this process involves, and also at some other ways 
in which user accounts can be created. Users can be put into groups, to which 
permissions can be assigned. Different types of administrators can be created, as well 
as different types of front-end users. We look at all this, and create some of these 
different user types for our Zak Springs site.
In Chapter 8, we finally come to content management in Mambo. The Content 
component is the main content engine of Mambo, and in this chapter, we look at the 
organization of content into sections and categories. After creating some of these, 
we proceed to enter content and examine the options available for entering and 
controlling the display of our content. We also see how to create menu items that 
point to our pieces of content, and examine the different views of content provided 
by the menus, which can display the content as a single item, or list items with a 
different layout and format.

Preface
[  ]
You can create special users that can add, edit, or publish content from the front end 
of the site, and in Chapter 9, we look at this. We also look at the publishing workflow 
this involves, whereby notifications are sent to various administrators to advise them 
of content submission that requires their approval. The notification system is not 
entirely straightforward, and we take a careful look at the process, and suggest some 
solutions to produce a more usable system.
In Chapter 10, we explore some more of the standard components that come with 
Mambo, and install and walk through the use of some third-party components for 
adding discussion forums, event scheduling, and a gallery of images.
In Chapter 11, we look at the details of customizing a template to produce a new-
looking site. We start with one of the standard Mambo templates, and make changes 
to the stylesheet and background images to gradually produce a different-looking set 
of pages.
In Chapter 12, we look at the steps required to deploy our local Mambo site to 
a remote web server. We also tackle setting file-system permissions for various 
operations of Mambo to function properly on the remote server. We conclude with a 
look at restricting access to your administration area using HTTP Authentication.
Appendix A has a walkthrough of installing the XAMPP package, which provides a 
working installation of PHP, MySQL, and Apache, ready configured for you to test 
your Mambo site on.
What You Need for This Book 
To use this book, you will need the latest version of Mambo, which can be freely 
downloaded from http://mamboxchange.com/frs/?group_id=5. The steps to get 
Mambo up and running are detailed in Chapter 2.
To get Mambo running, you need a working Apache/MySQL/PHP (AMP) 
environment on your local machine. The detailed installation of the latest XAMPP 
package is covered in Appendix A.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
There are three styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "Once 
you've copied that folder, rename it to mambo, and we're ready to go."

Preface

An Introduction to Mambo
Mambo is a free tool to manage the content of dynamic websites. To be more specific, 
Mambo is an open-source content management system. While that sounds nice, it 
probably doesn't answer the basic question of what it can actually do for you.
Mambo allows you to create a dynamic website with minimum effort and 
programming knowledge. To get the most out of Mambo, a knowledge of web 
development will prove to be useful, but even then, Mambo is written in the PHP 
scripting language, which is probably the most popular and straightforward 
language for creating websites and web applications.
In this chapter, we will take our first look at Mambo, understand what it can do, find 
out where to go for further resources, and discuss the site we will create in this book.
What Mambo Can Do for You
Put simply, Mambo helps you create websites easily. It provides a back end, a control 
area if you like, from where you add content and information to the site, configure 
the way things look, and also create a front-end public view of your site.
Maybe you want to create a site about wine making, flowers, programming, zombie 
films, or even dinosaurs. Maybe you want to create a site to promote your business 
and your products. Whatever type of site you want to create, Mambo helps you to 
structure the site to hold information relevant to your visitors; be it news stories 
about a forthcoming zombie film, links to other zombie sites, or even a gallery of 
stills from zombie films.
The best bit is, you don't have to be an expert programmer to achieve all this. With 
only rudimentary knowledge of HTML, you can engineer a unique-looking Mambo 
website, packed with the information you want for your site and your visitors.

An Introduction to Mambo
[  ]
The Visitor Experience
The standard installation of Mambo provides many features for its visitors. Some of 
them are:
Searchable content items (articles) organized into groups
Ability of visitors to create an account on the site, and log in to their own 
personal area
Ability of visitors to add comments about articles
Straw polls
A catalog of web links
RSS syndication of your articles to share your content with other sites
That's just some of the features of the standard installation. With a couple of clicks, 
you can install new features on the site, such as:
Discussion forums
Galleries of images
Mambo can be customized and extended easily, and there is a huge range of third-
party customizations and extensions to be found on the Internet. Any of these can 
add to the range of features your site provides.
The Management Experience
As a potential 'manager' of a Mambo site, as you read through the list of features 
above, you may think they sound rather attractive, but might also wonder how you 
will handle all of that. 
Mambo provides a web-based management interface. You, as the manager of the 
site, visit the site and log in with a special super user, or site administrator, account. 
After this, from the comfort of your web browser, you run the show. You can: 
Add new information, edit, delete, or move existing pieces of information
Control how the site will look
Decide the features of the site
Add media (documents, images, sounds) directly to the site
Control what is displayed on the pages
Control who is able to see what
In fact, you don't need to do all of this yourself. You can set up accounts for other 
people to take over the running of various parts of the site, maybe adding or 
checking content, or maybe just making sure everything runs smoothly.

Chapter 1
[  ]
The power and flexibility Mambo offers you to manage a complex website would be 
difficult to achieve without many, many hours of careful programming.
What Exactly is Mambo?
Mambo is a collection of PHP scripts that run on a web server, connect to a database, 
and display the retrieved data in a systematic way. In other words, Mambo is a data-
driven PHP web application.
Mambo can be downloaded for free, and then installed to your local machine for 
testing and development. The files and the database can be uploaded to a web-
hosting service, so that your site will be available to anyone on the Internet. There are 
even web-hosting services that offer Mambo installation at the click of a button.
Component-Based Architecture
Mambo is built around a 'core' set of functions, which perform mundane tasks such 
as selecting what part of the application the user should be shown, checking who 
the user is, and what they can do on the site. What makes Mambo exciting to the 
world is its support for components. These are extensions to the Mambo core, and 
provide the real functionality of your site. Mambo's support for managing content 
comes from the Content component, and there are components for displaying news 
feeds, discussion forums, and galleries among others. These extensions can be easily 
configured, and new extensions can be added to the system.
There is no shortage of third-party components on the Internet, and you can find a 
Mambo component for almost any imaginable purpose.
Templated Interface
The look of a Mambo site is controlled by a template. This is a collection of images, 
styles, and other resources, together with instructions that determine the layout of the 
page. A new template can be selected, and your site will be transformed immediately. 
In fact, you can even apply different templates to different parts of your site, so that 
your site can have different looks across different pages should you wish.
User and Permission Management
Mambo allows users to create their own account on the site, and takes care of boring 
details like making sure users can get a new password when they forget their current 
one. Pages on the site can be restricted so that only certain types of user get to see 
them, and also, certain users can be given certain permissions so that they can add or

edit content themselves. Instead of you having to do everything yourself, you can set 
up other people to help with the running of the site.
Mambo as an Open-Source Content 
Management System
We used the expression 'open-source content management system' earlier in the 
chapter to describe Mambo. Let's take a closer a look at this term.
Open Source
Mambo is free, and it is also open source. After downloading Mambo, all the source 
code of the application is there in front of you. This means, if you are so inclined, 
you can dig around to see how it works, or check why something is not working as 
it should. Mambo is not a perfect application (what is?), and there will always be 
parts that do not work as they should. Since there are many people using Mambo on 
the Internet, the problem is usually spotted and the solution is posted on one of the 
Mambo forums.
Another advantage of having the source of the application (the code) available to you 
is that you can modify (hack!) it, or extend it in whichever way you choose.
Mambo is released under a license, the GNU General Public License (GPL). The 
GPL bestows much freedom in the way that you can work with Mambo, but it also 
brings along some restrictions. The ins and outs of the GPL are pretty complex, and 
we aren't even going to attempt an in-depth discussion of the consequences of this. 
For more information about the GPL visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL.
The GPL should always be respected. The GPL is one of the cornerstones of the 
free software movement, which was set up to promote rights to use, modify, and 
redistribute computer programs. The upshot of the license is that Mambo will 
not be going away. Even if some future version of it were to become completely 
commercial, the existing code could be taken and modified to create a new version, 
also released with a GPL license.
Content Management System
We have spoken a lot about adding and editing 'information' on a website. A broader 
term for information here would be 'content'. To summarize our earlier discussions 
of Mambo, it allows you to manage the content of your site. In other words, it's a 
content management system.

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
According to Wikipedia, a Content Management System (CMS) is a 'system used 
to organize and facilitate collaborative creation of documents and other content' 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system).
Well, it is difficult to define content management system and avoid the words 'a 
system for managing content'!
You can think of a content management system as playing three roles:
Capturing content
Maintaining and Organizing content
Serving content
Capturing the content is usually done by users entering data in forms in a web 
browser. This content is then stored in a database for later retrieval. Serving the 
content allows the right data to be selected, sorted, and ordered, and then displayed 
to the visitor in a coherent and consistent way.
Mambo achieves all of these. Users with special accounts can input content from 
either the administrative part of the site, or even the front end of the site. This 
content can be maintained and organized from the web-based administration 
interface by the site administrator. When a visitor requests a page from the site, 
Mambo will determine which content should be displayed and how it should be 
ordered. It then handles the output of the content, along with the rest of the page.
Getting Help in the Mambo Community
Mambo has a substantial user base. There is a large group of people who run Mambo 
sites, develop extensions to Mambo, and create visual customizations, among other 
activities. In addition to these people, there is also a team of developers that work on 
the Mambo code. All of this adds up to a vibrant community that pushes the product 
forward, helps to address the problems faced by people working with Mambo, and 
offers support and encouragement to users.
There are a number of sites dedicated to Mambo that contain a range of Mambo 
resources, such as add-ons, bug fixes and patches, tutorials, and so on. You will also 
find the option of paid support for Mambo, and since Mambo is such a popular and 
widespread application, it will not be difficult to find a PHP developer who has 
experience of working with Mambo.

Each of these sites is well worth a visit to see what they offer:
http://www.mamboserver.com: This is the home of Mambo. This site is your 
first stop for news of the latest offerings from the Mambo community. Here 
you will also find links to the Mambo Developers Network, a list of Mambo 
developers worldwide, offering their products and services.
http://www.mamboxchange.com: The MamboXChange. This is a recepticle 
for Mambo software that can be downloaded for free. In addition to being the 
home of a multitude of extensions for Mambo, it is also the place from where 
you will download the source of Mambo itself.
http://forum.mamboserver.com: The Mambo forums. Here you will find 
many posts about problems encountered by Mambo users like yourself, 
along with tips and answers to solve the most common (and sometimes 
uncommon!) problems. If you find yourself with a problem, then the Mambo 
forums are a good bet to find a solution.
http://templates.mamboserver.com/: This site provides a number of 
free Mambo templates you can download and use to give your site a 
different look.
Any of the Mambo sites will have links to other recommended Mambo sites. In 
addition to providing valuable resources and information, all these sites will give 
you a good idea of what it is possible to accomplish on a Mambo site.
Forks, the Mambo Foundation, and 
Joomla!
Mambo has had a rather chequered history in recent times. Mambo was originally 
created by an Australian company, Miro, www.miro.com.au, and an open-source 
version was released in 2002, under the name of "Mambo Open Source". Since 
then, Mambo has continued to be developed by a group of developers from 
around the world.
In August 2005, the Mambo Foundation was set up by Miro to govern the 
future direction of the product. The purpose of this foundation is "to provide 
support and protection for the development of the Mambo software system" 
(www.mambo-foundation.org).
However, following the setup of the Mambo Foundation, many of the core 
developers resigned from the project, and began to work on a new product based on 
the existing codebase of Mambo. In the world of open source, such a new venture 
is called a "fork". (Remember we said that the GPL means that the code can't go 
away? Well this is exactly the kind of thing that can happen!) The new product the

[ 13 ]
developers began work on later became Joomla! (www.joomla.org). Both Mambo 
and Joomla! continue to develop, with the developers of each system having 
different views on the direction of the respective products.
Whatever the cause of the split, Mambo is still going strong, with the August 2006 
release of version 4.6 being the first major new release in over two years.
Zak Springs Golf Club Website
We're going to create an example site, "Zak Springs Golf Club", as we move 
through the book. Rather than just arbitrarily adding features to an empty Mambo 
installation, we will see how the list of requirements described below translate into 
actual actions for configuring Mambo, and the kind of decisions that need to be 
made to complete the site.
Zak Springs Golf Club is a rather colorful client. Before we get started with Mambo 
itself, let's take a moment to understand the site we're going to build.
The Client
Zak Springs Golf Club is located near the Skull Mountains, and boasts two 18-hole 
golf courses, practice facilities, and extensive hospitality facilities. The Golf Club 
was recently bought by a mysterious businessman, Otto Simplex, who now runs the 
club as General Manager. The club had fallen into disrepair over the last 10 years, 
beset by a number of mysterious incidents and unfortunate accidents. The club was 
founded 12 years ago, built on land cheaply bought from the military, following the 
immediate and uncommented closure of the top-secret Nemesis Project. The history 
of the club is still evident today, since the tougher of the two courses is in fact called 
Nemesis. The other course is the Sinistra course. Both are now in excellent condition, 
and present a formidable challenge for even the lowest-handicap golfer.
The Club is looking to expand its membership, and welcome new members from a 
number of the large metropolises that skirt the Skull mountains.
The Club currently has no website, but Mr. Simplex views the site as key to 
recruiting new members to the club, and also providing a community for the 
members of the Club, many of whom live far from the club. In addition to securing 
new members, retaining the existing members is key to the growth of the Club, 
and Mr. Simplex feels that keeping the members remotely involved in the club, in 
addition to providing excellent service and facilities at the Club itself, will go some 
way to ensuring this.

An Introduction to Mambo
[ 14 ]
The Club also has no dedicated IT support person, but the Assistant to the Club 
Secretary is regarded as the "go-to" person when there is a technical problem.
Staff
The senior staff of the Club are:
President
Otto Simplex
Administrative Staff
General Manager: Marie Flame
Club Secretary: Audrey Pores
Assistant to the Club Secretary: Edgar Hooch
Marketing Manager: Brad Visionary
Golf Staff
Director of Golf and Club Professional: Neil Vortex
Assistant Golf Professional: Dax Carew
Head Green Keeper: Cuthbert Cutty Cuthbertson
Hospitality
Executive Chef: Bunsen Honeydew
Assistant Food and Beverage Manager: Betty Book
Assistant Food and Beverage Manager: Chuck Spung
Receptionist and Guest Relations: Mya Lop
Requirements
From detailed meetings with the clients, the following list of objectives and 
functionality of the site was arrived at. Note that none of these relate specifically to 
Mambo. Fitting these requirements into Mambo will be the challenge of the later 
chapters. It is entirely possible that not all of the requirements will be achievable 
within our first attempt at putting the site together.

Permissions and Privileges Required
Administrative Staff to be able to publish and amend news items
Hospitality staff to be able to publish and amend content for 
hospitality facilities
Marketing Manager to be able to amend any content on the site
Nominated member of Administrative Staff to have full control over site
Ability to amend these permissions in future
Club President to have full control over site
Curiously, that last requirement was added in handwriting by the president himself, 
and did not appear in any earlier document.
Might Have... One day
The Club President has an ambitious vision for the site. However, in the first version 
of the site, there are some things that we have postponed. Some of these include:
E-commerce Features for the Professional's shop
Online Handicap register
Competition charts
This is a pretty extensive list of requirements to be going on with, so let's not hang 
around, since rumor has it that Otto Simplex is not a patient man.
Summary
This chapter has introduced Mambo. Mambo is an open-source content management 
system; you can also think of it as a free tool for managing the content of websites.
We looked at what Mambo offers in terms of a visitor experience, and also what 
this will mean for the person who is in charge of maintaining the site. Mambo 
has functionality to make site maintenance easy, and the site can be run from a 
web-based interface. We found out about the Mambo community, and where to go 
for help or further Mambo resources.
The chapter concluded with a quick description of Zak Springs Golf Club—the site 
we are going to create in this book.
We are ready to begin on this journey, so the next step is to actually get Mambo up 
and running.

Setting up the Development 
Environment
In this chapter we will cover how to install Mambo on a local machine running in an 
Apache/MySQL/PHP (AMP) environment. We will not cover the installation of AMP 
here; you can find a walkthrough of installing the XAMPP package in Appendix A. 
XAMPP is a free software package that includes PHP, MySQL, Apache, and much 
more, and is a quick way to get yourself a working AMP development environment.
Since in this chapter we are only dealing with creating a local installation for testing 
purposes, we shall postpone the coverage of how to deploy and set up Mambo on a 
remote web server until Chapter 11.
The steps to install and configure Mambo are simple:
1.	 Download and extract the Mambo files.
2.	 Copy the files to the web server root.
3.	 Step through the screens of the Mambo web installer.
4.	 Create another, less powerful database user to run the site under.
5.	 Remove the installation directory.
6.	 Test it out!
Let's get started.
Downloading Mambo
The latest version of Mambo can be downloaded from:
http://mamboxchange.com/frs/?group_id=5

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 18 ]
There is a link to this page from the Download Mambo link on the homepage of the 
mambo website, www.mamboserver.com.
Mambo Lite and Complete
From version 4.6 of Mambo onwards, Mambo comes in two flavors, Complete and 
Lite. Mambo Complete is the full Mambo package, with all the standard components 
and templates already included. Mambo Lite is a cut-down version of the full 
Mambo package, intended for people who don't want all the features of Mambo 
straightaway. The Lite package lacks a number of the standard components and 
templates, but still has enough for you to run a functional Mambo site.
Importantly, Mambo Lite contains the Content component, which drives the content 
management functionality of Mambo, and is the main focus of this book. All the 
things included in Mambo Complete but not in Mambo Lite can be downloaded 
and installed from the MamboXchange site. So, you are not cutting yourself off from 
Mambo's full potential by installing the Lite version, but it does mean you will have 
to do some more work to get extra parts installed.
In this book, we will work with the Complete package so 
that we can get a picture of everything that's available in 
standard Mambo.
If you choose to install and work with the Mambo Lite package, you will find that 
installation steps are identical.
You will find that you can download each package in a variety of compressed 
formats, like ZIP (.zip extension), GZIP (.tar.gz extension), etc. We will grab the 
ZIP file for the Complete package. It is a larger file than the GZIP version.
Extracting Mambo
Once you have downloaded Mambo, extract the contents of the Mambo ZIP archive 
to the hard drive.

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
If you don't have a tool for extracting the files, you can 
download an evaluation edition (or buy a full edition) of 
WinZip from www.winzip.com.
There are also free and powerful extracting tools such as 
7-Zip (http://sourceforge.net/projects/
sevenzip/) among others.
In the Mambo ���������������������������������������������������������������������
 ��������������������������������������������������������������������
folder, you will find a number of subfolders; some of these include:
components: Contains the PHP code for the components that will make up 
your Mambo site. Components are the essence of Mambo's operation. We 
will start looking at them once we've got Mambo installed!
modules: Contains the PHP code for Mambo's modules. Modules are mini-
functionality units and usually provide snippet views of components.
mambots: Contains the PHP code for Mambo mambots. Mambots are "little" 
plugins that hook into various parts of the system, and perform various tasks 
like filtering or preparing output.
language: Contains language files that allow the language of Mambo's 
interface to be changed.
images: Contains images used in the display of the Mambo site. This is 
where images used in your pieces of content will go.
templates: Contains the Mambo templates. The use of templates allows 
you to completely change the look of a Mambo site with a click of a button. 
Within each template folder is the CSS for that template, along with images 
used by it.
includes: Contain the core code that powers Mambo.
administrator: Contains code to power the administration area of your site.
Putting Mambo Files into the Web Server 
Root
In this book, we are going to use two installations of Mambo. The first will install 
the sample data, and will be accessed with the following URL, once we have 
installed Mambo:
http://localhost/mambo/
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 20 ]
The second installation will be blank; it will have no sample data and we will work 
with this to create our example site, Zak Springs. This installation will be accessed via:
http://localhost/zaksprings/
For now, we'll concentrate on the first installation.
The first thing we need to do is to copy the folder containing the extracted Mambo 
files into our web server root directory (\xampp\htdocs\ if you are using XAMPP). 
Once you've copied that folder, rename it to mambo, and we're ready to go.
We will refer to the mambo folder in the web server root as 
the 'root of our Mambo installation'. Once the Zak Springs 
site is created, the zaksprings folder will contain its code 
and will be the root of that Mambo installation. The fact that 
we have two installations should not cause confusion.
Installing Mambo
Open up your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/mambo/. You should 
see the following screen:

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
This first screen shows the status of a number of settings required to install 
Mambo. When a setting has a value that could prevent or compromise the Mambo 
installation, it is shown in red. If you scroll down the screen, you will see the 
write-access of the folders in the Mambo installation:
On your local machine, most of the settings in the Directory and File Permissions 
section will show as Writeable. This is not likely to be the same when you attempt 
to install Mambo on web-hosting server, since that will have different permissions. 
Some of Mambo's operations require write access to the filesystem, which means that 
PHP must have write permission to the filesystem. On a typical web server, PHP 
will have limited write access to the filesystem, but this is not a problem that we will 
likely experience on our local machines.
Without distracting from the ongoing discussion, we will 
postpone the tackling of the write-access problem on the 
web server until Chapter 12, where we will discuss it in 
greater depth.
Everything looks fine on the pre-installation check, so go ahead and click the Next 
button. The next screen shows us the license agreement for Mambo. We have to 
check the box to accept the license agreement and click the Next button before we 
can continue:

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 22 ]
Database Setup
The third screen in the web installer is where we set up the details of our database.
We need to specify:
The name of the server that the database is running on (usually localhost 
unless you know otherwise).
A MySQL user account that will be used to access the database (usually 
root unless you know otherwise), and the password to go with this database 
user account. Many MySQL installations have the password left blank. 
If you don't know the password for the root account to MySQL, it's 
probably blank!
The name of the database we want to create; by default it is mambo.
A table prefix for all the tables in the database. This is something added to 
the front of the name of each table in the Mambo database, to make the table 
names a bit more unique. This means that the Mambo tables can live in a 
database along with another application (some web hosts may restrict the 
number of databases you are able to create) without the name of any table 
clashing with the name of a table from another application. We'll leave this at 
the default value of mos_.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
There are three further options: Drop Existing Tables, Backup Old Tables, and 
Install Sample Data. Drop Existing Tables and Backup Old Tables are used if you 
are creating a new Mambo installation into a database that already has one. The third 
option, Install Sample Data, we will leave checked. This will install some sample 
information into our Mambo database, so that we've got things to look at as we take 
our first steps.
Once you've entered your database details here, click the Next button to continue. 
A dialog box will pop up checking if you've entered your settings correctly. If you 
think you have, click OK.
The next screen prompts you for the name of your Mambo site. This name will 
appear in the title of pages from the site, in the subject of emails sent from the site, 
and so on. We'll just enter Mambo Site for now. After entering the site name, click 
on Next to proceed.

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 24 ]
Site Details
The next step of the web installer is where you confirm the details of your site, and 
the details of a Super Administrator account. The Super Administrator is an account 
with ultimate power over your Mambo site, and will be used to do most of the 
configuration work on setting up the Mambo site.
The URL that will be used to access the site, and the Path on your machine to the 
Mambo installation are already provided for you.
You have to provide an email address for your Super Administrator account. Put 
your own email address into the Your Email field.
Next you have to provide a password for the Super Administrator account. The 
account is called admin, and it may be tempting to enter admin for the password. 
But bear in mind that you must remember to change it before you actually put your 
site live. One thing with Mambo is that the place for the administrators to log on is 
the same for virtually every Mambo site on the Internet, and if you've still got that 
Super Administrator account with the username of admin and the password of 
admin, then it won't take long before someone else has taken control of your site. It 
is, however, possible to change the name of this account later.
A random, strong, password is suggested for you. If you don't want to change that, 
make a note of it! If you do change the password, make a note of it!

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Once you've entered your email address and decided on the password, click Next to 
move on.

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 26 ]
Your installation is complete. The name of the Super Administrator account and 
its password are displayed, along with a form for you to register your Mambo 
installation. This is not required, but will help to give the creators of Mambo a better 
idea of exactly what people are intending to do with the system.
You now have two choices: view the front end of the site from the View Site link, or 
have a roundabout way through the Administration link. We'll stick with the front 
end for now, so click the View Site link.
Testing the Installation
Finally, we are ready to start testing the installation.
Click the View Site link from the web installer, or enter the 
URL http://localhost/mambo/ into your browser. You should see the 
following screen:
Let's do as we're told, and delete the installation directory from our Mambo folder. 
In case there is some confusion with the term installation folder (after all, the 
Mambo folder is our installation), then look in the folder containing your Mambo files 
(in the root directory), and you will see that there is a folder called installation. 
This is the folder you will want to delete.
The reason you need to remove this folder is that it contains the pages for the 
installer we have just used. If somebody were to access these pages again, they could, 
in principle, reinstall your site!
If you want to reinstall Mambo at any point, you can simply copy the installation 
folder (it should still be where you extracted it to!) back into your working Mambo 
folder, delete the configuration.php file, and installation can begin again. 
We'll soon see more about the significance of the configuration.php file. Instead of 
deleting the installation folder, you could rename it.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
If you working on your live site, you should delete the 
installation folder rather than renaming it. If you 
rename it, someone could still access it and reinstall 
your site! Since we are working in a local development 
environment, this is not so much of a problem. 
After deleting (or renaming) the installation folder, you should get your first taste 
of Mambo:
If this is what you see in your browser, then you can proceed further.
Creating a Database User
Now that things seem to be working fine, we will create a database user that can 
access only the Mambo database. This user is not a human, but will be used by 
Mambo to connect to the database while it performs its data-handling activities. The 
advantage of creating a database user is that it adds an extra level of security to our 
installation. Mambo will be able to work with data only in this database (in the 

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 28 ]
MySQL server), and no other. Also, Mambo will be restricted in the operations it 
can perform on the tables in this database. This will be useful in case our system is 
hacked by some outside evil.
The reason we did not do this before was that Mambo creates its own database, and 
creates tables in that. It requires a user account with a lot of privileges to do this kind 
of a thing. The root database account has the ultimate power, and can do this quite 
easily. Once the database is set up, the demands on the database in terms of creation 
are less, and so we do not really need this extra power on a regular basis. Thus we 
will switch to another user.
Also, we do it now so that we can assign privileges only to the Mambo database. 
Until the database is created, you can't really do that. Now that the database is 
created, it's an ideal time to switch to our less powerful, but still powerful enough, 
database user.
For our database work, we'll be using the phpMyAdmin tool. phpMyAdmin is part 
of the XAMPP installation (detailed in Appendix A), or can be downloaded from 
www.phpmyadmin.net, if you don't have it. phpMyAdmin provides a powerful 
web interface for working with your MySQL databases. If you're familiar with 
phpMyAdmin, or prefer to use the command line for working with MySQL, this 
section won't present any problems.
First of all, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/, or 
whatever the location of your phpMyAdmin installation is.
We will need to create a username for our MySQL user to access the mambo database. 
Let's call our user mamboer and go with the password mambopassword. However, 
in order to add an extra level of security we will introduce some digits and some 
other slight twists into our password in order to strengthen it, and so use the word 
mamb071Passv0rd as our database-user password.
To create the database user, click the SQL tab in phpMyAdmin, and enter the 
following into the Run SQL query/queries on database textbox:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mambo.* TO mamboer@localhost
          IDENTIFIED BY 'mamb071Passv0rd'
          WITH GRANT OPTION

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
Your screen should look like this:
Click the Go button, and the database user will be created:
Switching to the New Database User
Now that the user is created, we'll make a quick modification to the Mambo 
configuration to use this MySQL user account.
Enter the URL http://localhost/mambo/administrator into your browser, and 
you'll be taken to the login page for the administrator area:

Setting up the Development Environment
[ 30 ]
Here you need to enter the account details of the Super Administrator account that 
you created during the last step of the web installer. Enter the username (admin) and 
password (you did make a note if it didn't you!) and click the Login button.
You will find yourself in the Administrator area, also known as the back end of 
the site. From here you control your site. We'll talk more about this in the coming 
chapters. For now, select the Global Configuration option from the Site menu at the 
top of the page:
Click on the Database tab, and enter the details of the MySQL database user we just 
created in phpMyAdmin:

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
Click the Save button, and the configuration settings will be updated.
Now click the Logout link in the top right-hand side of the page, and you will be 
returned to the front end of the site.
We are ready to get started!
Still Having Problems?
If Mambo is still not working, and you have followed the steps in this chapter, then 
there is something wrong elsewhere, and it is likely that you will find the answer by 
scouring the forums at http://forum.mamboserver.com/. These forums contain 
many questions (and solutions) on installation (both local and on remote web 
servers) from users attempting to get their site running.

Setting up the Development Environment

Summary
In this chapter, we have walked through the typical steps to install Mambo on a local 
machine running an AMP environment.
We looked at where you get Mambo from, and also considered the two flavors of 
Mambo that you can get: Complete and Lite. Lite is a cut-down version of Complete, 
but contains the main functionalities required to get a Mambo site up and running. 
We chose to install the Complete version, but if you went for the Lite version, then 
you can simply install all the missing features as you go. We will see how to do that 
as we progress.
Installing Mambo was straightforward; we extracted the downloaded files, and then 
copied them into a folder in the root of our web server. Browsing to that folder in 
our web browser brought up the installation wizard, which stepped us through the 
installation process.
We had to provide the details of our database server so that Mambo could connect 
to it and create the required database tables. We also had to provide the password 
for the Super Administrator account. As we will see, this account can be used to 
do anything on our Mambo site, so choosing a strong password, and keeping that 
password safe is very important.
The final step to installation is to remove a folder called installation from inside 
the folder containing the Mambo code. Once this folder has been removed, Mambo is 
ready for action.
We made one last change to the standard installation in this chapter; we created a 
new database user with access only to the Mambo database, and then re-configured 
to connect to the database using this account. This is a first step towards increasing 
the security of our Mambo site.

Your Frontpage
Mambo is set up and you're ready to get started. Before you can dive in, we need 
to .... actually, let's dive in. I like to follow Captain Kirk's approach, "fools rush in 
where angels fear to tread..." I'm not suggesting you're a fool, dear reader, the fact 
you are reading this book shows you to be a person of impeccable taste. However, 
diving in to make our first modifications to the site will give us a great chance to 
get introduced to many of the main concepts of Mambo, which you will explore in 
greater detail in the coming chapters.
In this chapter you'll familiarize yourself with a visitor's eye-view of the Mambo 
world, and then peer into the secret realm of the administration area. The 
Administration area is the "base of operations" for managing and controlling our 
Mambo site. Along the way, we'll make our first changes to the site, and edit the 
content displayed on the frontpage of the site, and also change the way the frontpage 
display is configured.
Your Mambo Site
Navigate to the frontpage of your site in your browser. For our newly installed 
Mambo site, this will be http://localhost/mambo/. You should be presented with 
the following screen, which we saw at the end of the last chapter:

Your Frontpage
[ 34 ]
Considering that we've not really done anything, this is impressive. I'm sure you 
won't be able to resist clicking on some of these links and seeing what Mambo has in 
store for us. Of course, this isn't our site; everything that you see on the page comes 
from the Mambo example database, and I doubt that you plan to create a site that has 
the same content as this. For now, it gives us something to see and interact with to 
get a better feeling of how Mambo works.
Rest assured that over the next few chapters things will really start to heat up as we 
begin the creation of our new site.
Let's first talk about what we can see on the frontpage.
At the top, there is a site logo, a horizontal navigation menu, and a site banner 
image, often referred to as the masthead:

Chapter 3
[ 35 ]
The page body begins underneath this header. You can see that the layout of the 
body essentially consists of three columns with a big chunk of information in the 
middle column. The page layout of a Mambo site need not always look this; the 
arrangement of the elements, the choice of color, text styles, and images is controlled 
by the template. A different template can be selected for the site, and immediately, 
the look and feel of your site is changed.
Menus
The horizontal navigation menu at the top of the page is an example of a 
Mambo menu:
As you would expect, a menu in Mambo is there to provide navigation for the 
visitor. On our frontpage there are three menus displayed:
Top menu
Main menu
Other menu
The Top menu is the horizontal navigation menu we have just seen. It provides the 
visitor with quick access to what are considered the most important parts of the site.
The Main menu (located in the left-hand column) is the key navigation element of a 
Mambo site:
You will be familiar with this type of menu from almost every website that you have 
visited. This menu shows the main destinations within the site. The Home link is 
always found on a Mambo main menu, and returns you to the frontpage of the site, 
or the "homepage", however you want to call it.
•
•
•

Your Frontpage
[ 36 ]
Sometimes, when you visit certain pages (the FAQs page for example), the menu 
entry for that page will expand to show a list of further pages within that part of 
the site:
The Other menu (that is what it is called in Mambo; it's not just that I couldn't 
think of a name for it) contains other links. Currently, it is found under the Main 
Menu, and here it contains links to the main Mambo sites, and also a link to the 
Administrator area of our site.
One thing to note with Mambo is that the Main Menu, your 
primary navigation object, does not automatically fill up 
with links to different pages on your site. After creating a 
page or piece of content on your site you will need to add a 
link to one of these menus for the visitor to find it.
However, it would be absurd if every page on your website had to appear in one of 
these menus. If you had a large site, your menus would become massive and also 
cease to be useful to the visitor. As we will see, Mambo can automatically display 
lists of pages that come under the current page that you are viewing.
There is a fourth menu, the User Menu, but you can't see 
it on your page at the moment. It is only displayed once a 
visitor has logged into their user account. We'll see more of 
this menu in Chapter 7.

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
Modules
The menus that we have just seen are actually examples of a Mambo module. 
Modules in Mambo are little nuggets of information, which are scattered across 
the page, at the sides or above the main part of the content. They are similar to the 
sidebar blocks of information in a newspaper, providing weather information, 
brief headlines, and other snippets of information related to the main stories in 
the newspaper.
The menu modules for example provide navigation, linking to other parts of the site, 
while other modules provide a report or summary of the content that is available 
either on your site or, possibly, on another site. Typically, many modules are 
displayed on a single page.
On the frontpage, in addition to the menu modules, we can see the Latest News and 
Popular modules:
These two modules appear in the middle of the page, above the main page content. 
The Latest News module displays the titles of the most recently posted articles, and 
the Popular module displays the titles of the most viewed articles.
On the left-hand side of the page, under the Main Menu and the Other Menu, is the 
Login Form module:
This module presents a form for visitors to enter their login details, and then click 
the LOGIN button. If they don't have an account on the site, there is a Create one 
link to create an account. You will notice the Password Reminder link, with which 
(forgetful) users can be sent an email reminding them of their password. This is more 
evidence of how Mambo will take care of the tedious little details that are part and 
parcel of managing a sophisticated website.

Your Frontpage
[ 38 ]
If this module were to be removed from your pages, it would of course make it more 
difficult (but not impossible) for visitors to log in. If you click some of the links in the 
Main menu, then you will notice that the Login Form module does not show on all 
pages; in fact, it is only shown on the frontpage.
A module need not appear on all pages of the site; you can 
choose to have your module appear on only certain pages.
You will notice a commonality to the module display; there is a title bar, followed by 
the body of the module. However, not all modules need to look like this. The Search 
module (by default at the top of the right-hand column of the page) has no title bar:
Each module is configurable from the administration area as we'll see in the coming 
chapters. One thing that can be configured is whether or not to display the title of the 
module. The ability to configure each individual module like this means that there 
can be some variety on your page.
Components
See the bit right in the middle of the frontpage? That's the output of the 
current component.
Mambo is a component-based system. Each component is like a mini website in 
itself, performing different tasks and working with different types of content. The 
Mambo 'core' provides a central mechanism for handling these components, so that 
they work together sharing data and user information, and ensuring a consistent 
look and operation throughout your site. In short, the components define the 
functionality of your site.
The good thing with Mambo is that you can add and remove components to your 
heart's desire, selecting the best range of features to suit your site and its visitors. We 
will discuss the standard Mambo components over the next few chapters, but they 
are only the tip of the Mambo iceberg. There are numerous third-party components 
that can be downloaded and installed, covering a massive range of activities. 
The choice of available components is something that makes Mambo such an 
appealing system.

Chapter 3
[ 39 ]
When viewing a page on a Mambo site, the component currently in play can be 
determined by looking at the URL of that page. For example, click on the Getting 
Started link, and the page will have a URL like this:
http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=
category&sectionid=4&id=16&Itemid=27
The part of the URL after the ? character is the query string. The query string 
contains variables that are separated by the & character. In the above URL, the 
query string variable option has the value com_content. Mambo switches between 
components according to the value specified in the option query string variable.
Within a single component there are typically a number of different activities to 
be done, and the other query string variables indicate to the system which of these 
activities the visitor wants to perform. They also identify which item of data should 
be displayed. For example, on the Getting Started page, the URL is:
http://localhost/mambo46b1/index.php?option=com_
content&task=category
&sectionid=4&id=16&Itemid=27
Here, the task variable (which has the value category) is indicating that a list of the 
items in a "category" should be displayed, with the other variables specifying more 
information about which "category" is chosen.
The output of the component being currently viewed is displayed in the middle of 
the web page, and is generally the central focus of a page on a Mambo website.
The visitor isn't particularly aware of which component is being presented to them; 
as the visitor clicks links on the various menus and travels to different pages, Mambo 
will select the required component and display it to them.
Templates
The way the page has been laid out is not fixed in Mambo. The look of the page, the 
organization of where the modules sit, the colors, spacing, background images used, 
and so on, are all controlled by the template. Mambo allows you to select a new 
template, and immediately, the look of your site will be transformed.
In Mambo, there is no reason why the same template has to apply to all pages; you 
can assign a different template to certain pages on your site.
The default template, Water and Stone, looks OK (though a bit too much gray I'm 
sure you will agree), but there are countless other templates that you can find on the 
Internet, both free and commercial. You can download and install these, and give 

Your Frontpage
[ 40 ]
your site a completely new look. There are also a number of variations on the Water 
and Stone template that ship with Mambo itself.
Of course, there is no reason why you can't create your own template, or if you feel 
less bold, make some customizations to an existing template. We'll talk more about 
this in Chapter 11.
Viewing Site Content
Your site isn't just there to display little modules around the sides of the pages. It 
exists to display content to visitors, so, let's have a look at some content in Mambo. 
Click the FAQs link, and you'll see this in the middle of the page:
Although there is information here, what you are seeing isn't actually a piece of 
content, it's the details of a section. Mambo uses sections to organize your content 
into more manageable groups, and the text you can see displayed under the 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) title is the section description.
Underneath the section description is a list of categories within the FAQs section. 
Categories are a further refinement of your content into groups within the sections. 
We'll talk more about this hierarchy of content when we come to study it in more 
detail in Chapter 8.
We'll click on one of the categories to see what items are held under there. Click the 
Mambo and Security link and you'll see this when the page reloads:

Chapter 3
[ 41 ]
The main text we see here is the category description, the Mambo and Security 
category in this case. Underneath the description is a list of content items within this 
category. You can see the date the content item was created, its title, its author, and 
the number of times the content has been read.
Above the list of content items is a toolbar for filtering or sorting the list. If you 
select a new way to order the list from the Order drop-down box, the page will be 
reloaded with the new ordering of the list. The Display # drop-down box allows you 
to control the number of items displayed in the list. If there are more items than you 
want displayed, the items will be grouped into pages, and links will appear to take 
you to particular pages to see the items there.
Click the How do I keep track of security advisories link and we will finally see a 
piece of content!
That's actually a rather disappointing story, I have to confess.
In this short tour, we have seen that Mambo content is organized first into sections, 
which in turn contain categories. The actual pieces of content, the content items, 
belong to the categories. Content items do not belong to sections directly.
The good news is that we have traversed the content hierarchy to arrive at this item. 
There is no reason that you need to have your content "nested" like this on your site, 
Mambo's flexibility is too great to restrict you like that.

Your Frontpage
[ 42 ]
Looking at the content itself, you can see the title of the item in the large font 
(How do I keep track of security advisories?), followed by the text of the item 
(Visit the Forums regularly and subscribe to the Mambo Security Announcements 
mailing list).
Clicking the envelope graphic to the right of the content title pops-up a little window 
that allows you to enter details of someone you'd like to email the story to. It is 
possible to configure different elements to appear here; for example, there can be 
icons for creating a PDF copy of an article, or a printer-friendly version of it.
Note that the Back link at the bottom of the item has exactly the same effect as 
clicking the Back button on your browser; it takes you back to the last page you were 
looking at in the browser. It does not necessarily move up in the content hierarchy. 
This is similar to the experience when using Windows Explorer to view files on your 
hard drive; you can click the Back button to return to the folder just viewed, or you 
can click the up one button to take you to the folder containing the folder you are 
currently viewing.
Throughout all of this activity, if you were keeping an eye 
on the URLs of the pages you were looking at, you must 
have noticed that all of them have the value of com_content 
for the option query string variable, indicating that all of 
this is being done through the Content component. The 
Content component is the main content management engine 
of Mambo.
Pieces of content entered into the Content component have a fixed format. They have 
a title, some introductory text and then some main text. (The content item that we 
just saw in fact has only the introductory text and no main text!) With this format, a 
piece of content can be thought of as an article or story. We will often use the term 
article when talking about an item from the Content component. As you can see, we 
would otherwise end up using the word content too many times in our sentences!
This introduction to content in Mambo has also given us an idea of the 
administration tasks that lie ahead. We'll have to organize our content into sections 
and categories, manage these, and then get down to actually putting some content 
into the system.

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
Becoming the Administrator
You've had a quick play with the front end of the site, the part of the site that a 
standard visitor will get to see. Now it is time to enter an area that only a privileged 
few will be able to enter, the administration area. The administration area is your 
operational head quarters for actually controlling your Mambo site.
To start the journey, click the Administrator link in the Other Menu:
You will be taken to the administration login panel:
You will need to enter the administrator username and password that you created in 
the previous chapter, and then click the Login button to pass over to the other side: 
the administration area of your site.
Provided your credentials match and your identity is confirmed, you will get your 
first taste of the administration area:

Your Frontpage
[ 44 ]
Take a good look at the administration area; it will become like a second home to you 
as you manage a Mambo website. You are now the Administrator of your Mambo 
website, in fact, the SuperUser.
Like the front end of your site, the administration page has some notable elements. 
The first of these (under the administration banner) is the menu bar.
This menu bar contains a drop-down menu with links to the various 
administrative functions:
Mambo has many administrative functions, and organizing them into a familiar 
drop-down menu like this makes everything more manageable. One useful link is 
the Home menu entry on the administrator drop-down menu bar. That returns 
you to the page you are viewing at the moment, the "homepage" of the 
administration area.
On the right of the menu bar you can see the number of private messages waiting for 
you, the number of online users, and also a link to log out of the administration area.

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
Underneath the menu bar is a box for information rather like the navigation box in 
your browser. Here you will see a "path" to your current administration function.
To the right of this information box is the toolbar. Currently there is only one item on 
that toolbar, an icon for help. When we start doing things, more icons will appear on 
that toolbar.
Below that, is the main part of the page, the control panel.
The control panel has two modes, simple and advanced. The default mode is 
advanced, and shows a healthy number of icons in the panel. Clicking the Simple 
Mode link restricts the number of icons in the panel. With the advanced mode 
and its larger range of icons in the panel, you get access to a broader range of 
administrative actions.

Your Frontpage
[ 46 ]
Note that each icon in the control panel is a clickable link. 
An advantage of the control panel over the administration 
menu is that you can right-click on the icons in the 
control panel, and open the link in a new tab or window 
(depending on what your browser allows). This means that 
you can be working on different parts of the administration 
area in different tabs or windows, and perform different 
tasks without having to go back through the menu structure 
to get there.
On the right of the control panel is a tabbed element with some quick links.
The first tab shows the list of users currently logged onto the site (and paginated so 
that you don't have a massive list if your site is busy), and other tabs show links to 
the most popular or recent articles, and links to further administrative actions. This 
provides yet another way to get at different parts of your site quickly.
Previewing your Site
The first function of the administrator menu bar we'll look at is site preview, from 
Site | Preview | In New Window.

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
Of the three options, the first one, In New Window, 
displays the front end of your site in a new browser 
window. You will find yourself using this feature often 
to check your site as you make changes to it from the 
administration area.
The other two preview options, Inline and Inline with Positions, display the front 
of your site as a frame within your current browser window. With these options, as 
soon as you click on another function in the administration area, this will replace 
your preview of the site in your browser.
Managing the Frontpage
For the articles displayed on the frontpage of the site, their order and arrangement 
is controlled from the Frontpage Manager. This is accessed from the Content | 
Frontpage Manager option of the administrator menu bar. Selecting this option 
brings you to the Frontpage Manager:

Your Frontpage
[ 48 ]
First of all, you will notice that more icons have appeared at the right-hand end of 
the toolbar. You can use these icons to perform operations on a group of items listed 
in the Frontpage Manager control panel. Each item has a checkbox, where you check 
the items you want to act on, and then click on the icon in the toolbar to perform the 
action on this set of checked items. To act on all the items in one go, you can check 
the box in the title bar of the table to select all the items shown in the table.
The Frontpage Manager page shows the list of articles that will be displayed on the 
frontpage of the site. For each of these articles, the title and some other properties are 
listed. What the Section and Category properties represent should be familiar from 
our earlier discussion of sections and categories. There is also a column that shows 
the name of the Author of the article.
There are also drop-down boxes to filter the list of articles by section, category, or 
author. Also, you can enter some text into the Filter text box to show only articles 
that match the text you typed.
The remaining properties (Published, Reorder, Order, and Access) give us a good 
opportunity to introduce some very important concepts of a Mambo site: publication, 
ordering, and access restrictions.
Publishing Content
If everything that was entered into Mambo was always displayed on the site, 
this could lead to problems. Perhaps you have written an article to announce the 
imminent release of your new, top-secret, world-beating product, but it's not quite 
ready yet, and you don't know the exact date when it will be ready. Obviously, you 
don't want this displayed on your site celebrating the release of something that isn't 
actually available yet.
Displaying an article on the site is known as "publishing" the article. You can choose 
to enter the details of an article and not publish it, schedule it to be published at a 
later date, or unpublish an article, removing it from the site, but not deleting it.
The publication state of an article on the frontpage can be seen by the graphic in the 
Published column.
Published
Unpublished
If you hover the mouse cursor over the graphic in the Published column, more 
information about the article's publication state is displayed:

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
Publishing is not a concept restricted to articles in Mambo. Being published should 
actually be interpreted as "available on the site"; so with that in mind, it makes sense 
that things like modules can be published or unpublished, effectively activating or 
deactivating them on the site. The published property is one that you will see a lot in 
Mambo, across a whole range of elements, not just articles.
We can click the graphic in the Published column to toggle the publication state of 
an item. For example, unpublish the second article, then preview your site in a new 
window (from Site | Preview | In New Window on the administrator menu bar) 
and you will see that the Using Templates Effectively article can no longer be found 
on the frontpage, and the other articles have "moved up" to take its place. (That's an 
unusual task—being asked to look for something isn't there!)
You can publish single items by clicking the graphic as we did above, or you can 
publish or unpublish a group of items by checking their boxes in the control panel, 
and clicking the Publish or Unpublish icon in the toolbar:
Ordering Lists
Whenever you have a list of content items, you will probably want them displayed 
in a particular order. Possibly some are more important than others and you'd like 
these at the top of the list to catch the eye of your visitors.
Ordering also applies to things like menu entries; you don't really want the Home 
link on your main navigational menu to appear in the middle of the other links as 
this would rather frustrate your visitors, so being able to control the order in which 
things are displayed to the visitor on a page is useful. Of course, you might want to 
offer the visitor the option to reorder the display for their own taste, but you do want 
to make sure that your lists are ordered to your satisfaction.
There is a Order column in the table in the Frontpage Manager control panel. The 
number in this column determines the rank of that item, with the lowest ranking 
item displayed first in a list, and then the next highest rank and so on. It is easy to 
reorder items. To move an item up, simply click the up arrow in the Reorder column 

Your Frontpage
[ 50 ]
and the item will swap positions with the one above it in the list. Clicking the down 
arrow will swap the item's position with the one below it in the list. 
In this way, you can move items up and down your frontpage.
Note that although there are supposed to be six articles displayed on the fisrt page of 
the frontpage (according to the table in the Frontpage Manager control panel), you 
didn't see all of them on the frontpage. The first article, Welcome to Mambo!, was 
displayed prominently, with the next two articles, Using Templates Effectively and 
Getting the Most out of Your Mambo Site displayed underneath. Only the titles of 
the three remaining stories could be seen, underneath these first stories.
Restricting User Access
Security in your Mambo site controls who can do what in a particular place. There 
are two fundamental problems of security here:
Authentication: Deciding if the user is who they claim to be
Authorization: What that user is able to do when browsing the website
Mambo solves the authentication problem with user accounts. It authenticates users 
(when necessary) by asking for a username and password combination.
Mambo solves the authorization problem by classifying the status of the visitor to 
your site into one of the following:
Public: Any visitor to the site. Until a visitor registers and logs in, he or she 
has no identity and is simply a member of the public.
Registered: Visitors with a user account who have logged in with a valid 
username and password.
Special: This is a Registered User who belongs to a group that has certain 
front-end "modification" permissions. Members of these groups are able to 
add content, edit content, or even publish content directly to the site. We'll 
talk more about these groups in Chapter 7.
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
Anybody browsing the site falls into one of these categories, and there are many 
opportunities within Mambo to restrict access to content to one of these "levels". 
These restrictions, or 'permissions' if you like, rather than being assigned on an 
individual user basis are assigned to one of the above categories of users. In this way, 
access to parts of your site can be restricted and these restrictions can be 
easily managed.
Restricting access, so that only visitors from a particular group can view certain 
content, is commonplace in Mambo.
The current access level of a particular article can be seen in the Access column 
of that article. You can click the column to toggle between the three values we 
mentioned above.
For example, it is easy to make a content item accessible only to registered users 
of the site. To make Need Help with Mambo? accessible only to registered users, 
simply click its Access column until it says Registered. After that, preview the site 
in a new browser window, and you will see that that article is no longer seen on the 
frontpage, well, not by you anyway!
With a click (well, a couple of clicks!) of your mouse, you have already designated 
an item of content as being viewable only to people who actually have an account on 
your site. On the downside, since we don't have any user accounts set up you can't 
actually see it yet!
Editing an Article
Now we'll take our first steps towards editing content in Mambo. We'll change the 
text in the Welcome to Mambo! article; you can rewrite it completely if you feel 
inclined. To do this, from the Frontpage Manager, click on the title of the Welcome 
to Mambo! article, and you will be taken to the Content Item: Edit screen:

Your Frontpage
[ 52 ]
Here you can see the details that make up the content item: its Title, Title Alias, and 
the Intro Text. Scroll down your screen a bit further and you will see the Main 
Text field.
You can also see the section and category that this article belongs to in the Section 
and Category drop-down boxes.
You will also notice that a number of new icons have appeared in the toolbar: 
Preview, Upload, Save, Apply, and Close.
The Preview icon displays the article in a pop-up window similar to how it 
would appear on the site. Note that the preview actually displays the current 
version of the article you are working on, including the changes you have 
made since you started editing and have not yet saved.
The Upload icon allows you to add a file to the Mambo file storage. We'll 
skip past that for now, and think about the Save, Apply, and Close icons.
The Save icon stores your edits in Mambo, updating the article. After it 
has finished saving, you are returned to the previous menu (the Frontpage 
Manager in this case).
•
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
The Apply icon also saves your changes, but keeps you in the Edit screen. 
This can be useful if you are making a lot of changes, and want to save as 
you go.
The Close icon cancels all your edits and returns you to the 
Frontpage Manager.
To see the importance of these icons, ����������
click the Back button in your browser to see 
the Frontpage Manager again. This time, you will notice a padlock icon next to the 
Welcome to Mambo! article.
This padlock icon indicates that this article has been "checked out".
You can Check Out Any Time, But You can 
Never Leave
When you begin to edit an item, it gets checked out. When an item is checked out, it 
can't be worked on by another administrator or "editor", and also, certain operations 
cannot be performed on the item by you until you have checked it back in.
Since the padlock icon sits on top of the checkbox to select the item for moving, 
copying, or deleting, these cannot be done until you have checked the item back in, 
and the padlock vanishes.
We've seen that leaving an item in the middle of editing leaves it checked out. To 
check the item back in, you will need to either use the Save or Close icons on the 
Content Item: Edit screen to terminate your editing session. Clicking the Apply icon 
will save your changes but will keep the item checked out to you.
Another restriction on a checked-out item is that it cannot be 
published while it is checked out.
You can imagine that this could lead to lots of items being checked out all over your 
site when you have started work on them, but then decided to do something else 
without first using Save or Close. To take care of this, there is a feature to check in 
any item on the site that is currently checked out. This is done with the System | 
Global Checkin option on the administrator menu bar. The Global Checkin feature 
•
•

Your Frontpage
[ 54 ]
trawls the database looking for anything marked as checked out, and proceeds to 
check it in.
In the same way that the concept of "publication" applies to parts of Mambo 
beyond articles, so the "check out" concept also applies beyond simply editing 
articles. Many Mambo components use checking out to protect the "thing" you are 
working on. When you begin editing something from one of these components in 
the administrator interface, that element is marked as checked out in the Mambo 
database, and the same restrictions apply as when editing articles. Also, these 
elements will be checked in by the Global Checkin feature above.
Now that we've encountered checking in and out, click the title of the Welcome to 
Mambo! article again and let's get back to editing it.
Editing with the HTML Editor
Under the article details is the HTML editor for working with the article content:
The HTML editor makes adding your article text easier, providing an interface 
similar to that of Microsoft Word, Wordpad, and so on.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
For example, you can format your text in bold or italics, add an underline, or select a 
style from the Styles drop-down box. You can also add bullets, numbered lists, and 
other visual styles.
If you like, you can edit the HTML source by clicking the HTML button, and click 
the Update button when you're finished to return to the HTML editor.
Note that the HTML editor is not part of the Mambo 
Lite package.
Adding Images
There are two ways in which you can make use of images in your content. The first 
allows you to add an image when you know its URL, and we'll look at that here. 
The second way allows you to upload an image to the server directly, and put 
that into your content using the mosimage mambot. We'll see more of that in the 
coming chapters.
If you know the URL of the image you want to add, you can add it by clicking the 
Insert/edit image button:
A dialog pops up, which allows you to enter the URL where the image can be found, 
and also specify things like the image border and its size, among others. After you 
enter the URL into the Image URL field, click in one of the other fields, and the 
image will be displayed in the Preview pane:

Your Frontpage
[ 56 ]
Clicking the Insert button adds the image into your content:
Click the image to select it, then click the Insert/edit image button again, and you 
can edit the properties of the image, such as setting a border, or setting the style from 
the Appearance tab. Here we set the Style of the image to give it a dashed border. 
The information we use here is the CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) syntax for setting 
a border:

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
Click Update, and our image is modified:
Cascading Stylesheets allow you to format your HTML in different ways. You can find 
more examples of CSS at http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp.
Adding Links
Adding a link to your content is straightforward. Simply select the text for the link:
Then the link icons will become active in the editor:
Click the left-hand of the above icons, the Insert/edit link button, and a dialog will 
pop up into which you can enter the URL for the link:

Your Frontpage
[ 58 ]
You enter the URL into the Link URL field and click Insert, and the text you selected 
will be made into a link:
If you want to edit the link, click on it, then click the Insert/edit link button again. 
From the Insert/edit link dialog, you can modify other properties of the link, such as 
the window in which the link will open from the Target option.
Note that if your URL does not begin with http://, then by default, the editor will 
convert the URL into an absolute URL with http://<server> added to the front. This 
means if you were trying to link to a page on your site, it will have the current server 
hardcoded into the link. If you were working locally before deploying to a remote 
server, you would find that your links still point to the local machine! You can turn 
off this feature from the configuration of the HTML editor, which you find under 
Components | MOStlyCE Admin. There are a number of configuration settings that 
can be made here, including turning off this feature to Convert Absolute URLs:
The Insert/edit link dialog allows you to specify a huge number of options for your 
link if desired, including a popup to display when the link is clicked.

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
Email Addresses, Spam, and Mambots
Instead of entering a URL into the Link URL field of the Insert/edit link dialog, you 
can use mailto: followed by an email address to produce a link that will open the 
user's email client when clicked, ready to send a mail to that specified email address. 
Including email addresses like this in page output is a notorious source for "spam 
harvesters", who collect such email addresses and add them to mailing lists for rather 
undesirable mails.
However, Mambo comes to your rescue here. If you create a mailto: link in this 
way, say for the email address doug@packtpub.com, Mambo will include something 
like this in the HTML of the page, which is almost impossible for a spam harvester 
to deciper:
<script language='JavaScript' type='text/javascript'> 
<!-- 
var prefix = '&#109;a' + 'i&#108;' + '&#116;o'; 
var path = 'hr' + 'ef' + '='; 
var addy78528 = 'd&#111;&#117;g' + '&#64;' + 'p&#97;cktp&#117;b' + 
'&#46;' + 'c&#111;m'; 
var addy_text78528 = 'd&#111;&#117;g';
document.write( '<a ' + path + '\'' + prefix + ':' + addy78528 + '\'>' 
); 
document.write( addy_text78528 ); 
document.write( '<\/a>' ); 
//--> 
</script>
Mambo keeps you safe like this through the Email Cloaking mambot. Mambots 
appear every so often in Mambo; they are hooked into various parts of the system 
and perform a single task, in this case formatting some output. When Mambo wants 
to display some content, it sees what "content" mambots are plugged in, and passes 
them the content for some processing. The Email Cloaking mambot for example 
looks for any HTML of the form <a href=mailto: (which would be an email link), 
and processes that into something like the form above.
You have already seen some other mambots in action. This Write Comment link is 
produced by a mambot, and can be seen under some of the content items:

Con��������������������������������
trolling Article Display on the 
Fron�����
tpage
Remember we said you can control how many articles are displayed on the 
frontpage? Well, let's see you try to find the function to change that in Mambo. It's 
not done from the Frontpage Manager; that only manages the articles on the page, 
not their layout. Have a look round the administration area and see if you can find 
something that looks like it could solve our problem. You probably won't find what 
you're looking for.
Let's think about this another way. How do I get to the frontpage? Well, one way is 
to click the Home link in the main menu. Thinking about it further, it makes sense 
that the "menu item" could, in some way, have some influence over the way things 
are displayed on the page it is pointing to. That's exactly right!
Select Menu | mainmenu from the administration drop-down menu. You'll see the 
Menu Manager for the mainmenu:
This shows all the items on this menu, and information about them. Again we see 
things like the publication state of the menu item, its order, who can access it, and 
so on. The Home menu item is the one that takes our fancy here. Click on the Home 
menu item, and you'll be taken to the Edit Menu Item page (like the Content Item: 
Edit page we saw for the frontpage content item earlier):

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
The Details of the menu item are on the left-hand side of this form, and the 
Parameters table on the right is what we're after. In general, each menu item has two 
bits of information.
Details of the menu item itself: its Name, URL (where it points), Parent Item 
(where it sits in the menu hierarchy), Access (who can see it), and whether 
it's published or not.
Data that controls how the target page of the menu item should be displayed. 
This is what the Parameters table takes care of.
There are many, many options in the Parameters table so we won't look at all of 
them here; we'll focus instead on the # Leading, # Intro, Columns, and # Links 
fields. In general, there will be different options in the Parameters table depending 
on what the menu item is pointing to. For example, if the menu item isn't pointing to 
the frontpage of the site, it wouldn't really make sense for you to be able to control 
the number of items on the frontpage from the parameters of that item. And in 
Mambo, if it doesn't make sense, that's not how it works!
We'll see more about menu items and the Parameters table in later chapters when we 
create new menu items.
The # Leading field determines how many stories are displayed at the top of the 
page. These stories are displayed underneath each other. After that, the number of 
stories defined by the # Intro field are displayed. These can be put into columns, the 
number of columns controlled by the value in the Columns field. Finally, the # Links 
field controls the number of article titles that will be displayed underneath this.
We're going to keep # Leading at 1, so there is one story displayed prominently, but 
then we're going to have four articles displayed under that, across two columns, so 
we set # Intro to 4, and Columns to 2. We'll leave # Links as it is for now.

Make these changes, click the Save button, and then preview your site in a new 
window. Now you will see the change in frontpage configuration.
Summary
OK, we dived in. We had a look round the example Mambo site, and got ourselves 
acquainted with menus, modules, components, and templates. We saw how content 
appears on the site, and how you navigate around content structures to find articles.
That was a rather passive activity. Next we actually did some things. We logged into 
the administration area, and had a look around. We met the concepts of publishing, 
ordering, access restrictions, and checking in (and out!).
Finally, we started editing one of the articles that appears on the homepage. This was 
done from the Frontpage Manager. We saw the HTML editor that makes it easy to 
enter formatted text into Mambo, and finally, modified the way articles are displayed 
on the frontpage of the site, introducing us to Mambo menu entries.

Configuring the Site
In this chapter, and over the next few chapters, we will begin to acquaint ourselves 
with Mambo's administration area, which allows you to manage your site from the 
comfort of your web browser. We'll look first at the site configuration settings. These 
options control many global properties of the site, such as the name of the site, mail 
server setup, and some default options for displaying content, among others. We 
conclude the chapter with a quick look at the Private Messages functionality that is 
used to send notifications to back-end users in many parts of Mambo.
We will also create a new installation of Mambo without the sample data. This new 
installation will be our Zak Springs site that we will gradually add to as we progress 
through the chapters.
After we've mastered site configuration in this chapter, we'll move on to look at 
module and component administration, followed by menus and templates in the 
coming chapters.
Your Site, Your Database
The database that we created when we installed Mambo in Chapter 2 is Mambo's 
storage repository.
That may sound like a rather trivial remark; we know Mambo is a database-driven 
web content management system. However, it is worth understanding the nature of 
what Mambo stores. It stores not only information about registered users of the site, 
and things like your content items, features about you, your company, or your club, 
your photos and other images, but also stores information about the layout of your 
site, which features are enabled, how they are configured, and so on.
There are many more things Mambo squirrels away into its database, but the point in 
general is that your site is determined by the contents of its database.

Configuring the Site
[ 64 ]
This may sound rather overwhelming, particularly if you are new to databases—but 
this is precisely where the real power of Mambo lies. You don't have to be a MySQL 
master or know anything about the finer points of database theory; in fact, you 
generally won't be touching the database yourself. Mambo's powerful and 
easy-to-use web-based administration tool lets you control and maintain your site 
through the comfort of your web browser. Through it you are effectively managing 
the database; but this happens behind the scenes and it is not something that you 
need to overly concern yourself with.
This also suggests that maintaining your database is very important; if the database 
is, in some sense, your site, then you need to make sure that you make backups of 
the database regularly, ready to restore if some problem presents itself. Lose your 
database, and you have lost your site!
Starting Afresh
We've installed Mambo once, and used the sample data to guide our first steps. 
However, from now on, we're going to work with a clean installation; with virtually 
nothing in the database to start with. We will be adding everything ourselves. This 
will give you a good feel for the process that takes you from "zero to site".
Install Mambo again; this time, copy the files to a folder called zaksprings in the 
root of your web server. You can start the web installer from:
http://localhost/zaksprings/
As you step through the web installer, this time call the database zaksprings, and 
uncheck the Install Sample Data checkbox on the Database Configuration step:
Yes, you are experienced with Mambo, so go ahead and uncheck it! If you do not 
think you are experienced with Mambo, you will be—you will be.
Also during installation, set the name of the site to be Zak Springs Golf Club.

Chapter 4
[ 65 ]
Once the installation is complete, you will find that there is very little in this new site, 
and only two entries on the menu. Never mind, we'll soon have things livened up.
Visiting the Administration Area
With Mambo's administration features, you manage your site through your browser, 
controlling every aspect of its behavior, as well as adding and maintaining the 
content that is displayed. This doesn't mean that anyone can mess with your site; 
access to the administration area is restricted. You, the Super Administrator, as head 
of administrators, have supreme power and can even appoint other people to act as 
administrators, with specific abilities to manage certain parts of the back end of 
the site.
Mambo's administration area is sensibly organized, especially considering the range 
of activities that can be done from there. The actions you perform, the icons, menus, 
and the way that you interact with the system when doing these things is pretty 
consistent. Over the next few chapters we will get to grips with the administration 
area, since in your role as a Mambo website administrator, it is where you will spend 
most of your time (the administration area, not these chapters!).
The first thing to do is to log in to the administrator area. Enter the following URL 
into your browser:
http://localhost/zaksprings/administrator/
If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted for the administrator 
username and password created earlier. Enter these values and click the Login 
button to proceed.

Configuring the Site
[ 66 ]
You will be brought to the home page of the administration interface:
This is the central hub of the administration interface. The icons in the control panel 
in the centre of the screen, and the menu entries from the drop-down menu that 
link to specific parts of the administration area, are responsible for the control and 
management of particular features.
Note that if you do not have JavaScript enabled in your 
browser, then you will find that most of the administration 
area does not work. For example, the main administrator 
menu will not display, let alone present the drop-down 
options, and the toolbar buttons will not do anything. Make 
sure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser to use the 
administration interface.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
Global Configuration of your Site
Our first task is to make some global settings. Many of these are to do with the 
underlying platform on which Mambo is running (web and database server, and 
mail server setup, among others), some specify system-wide defaults.
These settings are the first step in getting the site to work the way you want it to.
The Site | Global Configuration menu option allows you to make these 
configuration changes that will apply "globally" to your site.
The configuration options are carefully organized into tabs based on the task or 
service to which they relate. You click on one of the tabs to bring up the options for 
that task:
Above the tabs you can see the standard toolbar buttons for saving your 
configuration changes (Save), applying your changes (Apply for "save and continue"), 
canceling your changes (Cancel), and getting more help (Help).
Although you can see lot of tabs, the Global Configuration manager is a single page. 
When you click one of the tabs to view its options, the new tab is selected by some 
JavaScript code in the page. This means that if your browser has JavaScript turned 
off, you simply won't be able to access any of the tabs other than the Site tab. Should 
you be experiencing this, then you can turn JavaScript back on in your browser to get 
things going.
Another consequence of all the tabs being on the same page is that you can modify 
some options on one tab, then you can then click on another tab to modify an option 
there without having to save your changes first. As long as you remember to save all 
your changes once you're done, all the changes you make will be persisted.
How the Options are Stored
After you save changes in the Global Configuration manager, Mambo actually 
creates a new version of the configuration.php file in the root of your Mambo 
installation. This file contains all the configuration options in a form that can 

Configuring the Site
[ 68 ]
easily be used by the system without having to go and retrieve these settings from 
something like the database. This does mean that your configuration.php file has 
to be writable by PHP in order to save any new configuration settings.
If the file isn't writeable, you will see this message at the top of the Global 
Configuration manager:
In this case, you will need to check the Override write protection while saving 
checkbox before you save your changes. Provided that PHP is able to change 
the permissions of the file, this will allow the changes to be written to the 
configuration.php file, and will then set the file back to read-only once it is 
finished. On a remote server, PHP may not be able to change the permissions of files 
on the server. We talk more about this in Chapter 12.
These are the tabs in the Site Configuration manager:
Site
Locale
Content
Database
Server
Metadata
Mail
Cache
Statistics
SEO
We aren't going to cover all the possible configuration options. There are simply 
too many of them, and for most of them, their relevance to you at this point will 
be unclear.
As we move through the chapters, we will meet a number of the global configuration 
options as and when we need. Then, we will discuss them in more detail.
Note that if you hover your mouse cursor over the i icon at the end of each option, a 
message describing the option will be displayed to you. The image at the top of the 
next page shows the message describing the Show UnAuthorized Links option on 
the Site tab:

The Site Tab
The configuration settings on the Site tab are the most general ones. This tab allows 
you to turn your site on or off (the front end that is; turn off the back end and you're 
in trouble!), as well as the message to display when the site is offline.
The Site Name is also here; this goes into the page title in the browser, and is 
included in emails sent out by the system.
We'll meet many of the other options later in the book.

Configuring the Site
[ 70 ]
Locale 
The Locale tab controls the default language setting for your site, and the time offset. 
The main use for the time offset value is when your server and your main audience 
are in different time zones. For example, if you are running a site for a UK audience 
with a server based in the US, the time on the web server would be different from 
the time of the site's usual visitors, and you would use the Time Offset property to 
ensure that these match up. If the server is in a time zone 6 hours behind the UK time 
say, then you would want to select 6 from the Time Offset field. If somebody was on 
the site at 12 pm UK time, this would be recorded as 6 am in the server time zone, so 
6 would need to be added to that value to make it the actual time.
The default language is en, which is English. The available languages are shown in 
the drop-down box. Selecting a new language will change the "interface" language.
Content
The Content tab contains a number of options that will be applied to the display of 
individual content items. As we'll see later, there is an opportunity to override these 
global options in specific cases.
The options on the Content tab control things like showing the email, PDF, or 
printer-friendly icons for the content items, as well as things like showing the 
number of times a content item has been read, when the item was created, and so on.
Database
The database tab contains the settings for connecting to the system database. If 
you change the MySQL Database option���������������������������������������
, make sure it points to another Mambo 
database, or you will break your site! If you want to change this setting, you will 
have to go into configuration.php file, and change the $mosConfig_db ������������
variable to 
the name of your working Mambo database.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
<?php
$mosConfig_offline = '0';
$mosConfig_host = 'localhost';
$mosConfig_user = 'mamboer';
$mosConfig_password = 'password';
$mosConfig_db = 'mambo';
$mosConfig_dbprefix = 'mos_';
Changing the MySQL Database option is useful when you want to choose a new 
MySQL user to access the database, or move your site information and contents (or 
data) to a new database, without modifying the existing one.
Mambo accesses your database server through the root database user, which has 
complete control over the entire database server. You may want to use a different 
database user, which has power only over the Mambo database. You can specify this 
user here.
The database user needs to be root at installation since it creates a database, and then 
creates and fills lots of tables. This is more power than you would normally want 
from a database connection from your live website, so you can move to another 
MySQL user here.

Configuring the Site
[ 72 ]
Configuring the Web Server
The Server tab displays options related to PHP settings on the web server.
The Login Session Lifetime option determines the length of time that a session can 
remain inactive before it is removed from the server. The default value is 15 minutes 
(900 seconds). Each time a user logs into your site, a session is created on the web 
server. The Login Session Lifetime option value means that if a logged-in user does 
nothing on the site for 15 minutes, the next time they attempt to do something they 
will find that their session has expired, and they will have to log in again.
The Register Globals Emulation option (set to On by default) controls whether global 
PHP variables should be defined from incoming request parameters (such as variables 
in the query string, or fields contained in a submitted form). This process, whereby 
variables are created without the intervention of the programmer, is generally 
discouraged in PHP applications. Typical security advice for PHP applications is to 
turn off this activity (see http://uk2.php.net/register_globals for example). 
Since many servers will have this activity turned off by default, a number of PHP 
applications actually simulate the activity, by explicitly creating global variables from 
request variables. This may seem an odd thing to do, but it is mostly due to the age 
of the application and a desire to keep parts of it working that might have relied on 
these global variables. In Mambo, setting Register Globals Emulation to Off is a 
security-conscious choice, but problems have been reported with some third-party 
components. So you will have to monitor its consequences carefully.

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
Error Reporting is set to System Default, which means the standard server options 
for PHP error reporting are used. When executing scripts, PHP can generate errors 
that do not force it to stop executing, such as notices or warnings about undefined 
variables. In Mambo, the display of these errors is controlled by the Error Reporting 
option here. If you find that you see messages like Notice: appearing on your pages, 
then you may want to set Error Reporting to None. The errors reported by PHP are 
different from any problems Mambo might encounter when running, and Mambo 
has its own methods for catching problems with its operation, which are not affected 
by this setting.
Sending Mail
This tab controls the options for sending mail from your site. Mail is sent to users 
when they register for an account, and also for administration notification purposes.
For mail to be sent properly (or indeed at all!), you need to have your mail server 
settings correctly configured on this tab. The mail server can be configured to use 
either the PHP mail function, a Sendmail, or an SMTP Server.
The choice of mail server setting will depend on the set up of your web server. To 
use the Sendmail option the web server will need access to a working installation of 
Sendmail, and for the PHP mail function to operate properly it has to be properly 
configured on the web server. For your live site, you will have to check with the 
system administrator of the server to see if these options are viable for you. One 
option that will likely always be available to you is the SMTP Server option.
Your ISP will probably have provided you with access to an SMTP server that you 
can use to send outgoing mail. Check with your ISP if you don't know the details. 
Once you know the details, enter them into the SMTP fields on this tab to get your 
site's outgoing mail up and running. You will need a username and password for the 
SMTP account, and once you've got these, enter them into SMTP User and SMTP 
Pass fields, and select Yes from the SMTP Auth option. You only need to enter 
values into the SMTP fields if you are using the SMTP Server mailer option.
You also specify the email address that the mails will be sent from, and the name 
(name displayed in the recipient's email client) of that account.
Enter the details of your SMTP server here, and for our Zak Springs site, we'll enter 
Zak Springs Golf Club into the From Name.

Configuring the Site
[ 74 ]
Cache
Whenever a page is requested from your Mambo site, the system does a lot of work, 
retrieving things from the database, getting and displaying content items, and then 
preparing the page for viewing. To decrease the load on the database, and improve 
the response time of your site, Mambo can cache (save) the HTML output of some 
items to the disk. These items can then be retrieved immediately rather than having 
to get raw data from the database and then build some new HTML output.
Another reason for using caching is that the content items on your site will likely not 
be changing that often. If you only update the site every few days, why would you 
need the system to go to the database, grab a content item, and format it every time 
the item is requested, when it hasn't changed the way it looks in a while? This is a 
good situation for caching.
You turn on the cache by setting Caching to Yes. The cache needs a folder on the 
server that can be written to. The default folder is the cache folder in your Mambo 
installation. You can set this location from the Cache Folder option. If you put your 
cache elsewhere, ensure that the directory is writeable by PHP.
The Cache Time is the number of seconds that something will be stored in the cache 
before it is freshly generated. The default value is 900 seconds.
Module output is cached, and caching is used by some components like the Content 
component, to cache content items. Items that depend on the current user will not be 
cached, as this could mean that someone other than the current user could see them. 
Nothing related to the administration area is cached.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
If you hover your mouse cursor over the i icon at the end of the Cache Folder option, 
instead of seeing a message about what the Cache Folder is, you will see the current 
status of that folder's writeability. This happens for a number of options in the 
Global Configuration; the text isn't necessarily a help message, it's a status message.
Visitor Statistics
By default, Mambo keeps basic records of who visits your site, what browser they're 
using, and so on. (This is enabled with the Yes value of the Statistics option.) The 
other options enable different kinds of records to be kept, such as when a particular 
content item was viewed, or what terms were entered into your site search facility. 
This will allow you to build up a richer picture of what is happening on your site.
The statistics themselves can be viewed from the Site | Statistics option of the 
administration drop-down menu.
Making Mambo-Search Engine Friendly
Your site isn't really of much use unless people actually visit it. One way for people 
to find your site is through web search engines. However, getting the pages on your 
site near the top of the returned results for particular searches is not a random matter 
or luck. It is the end of an activity called Search Engine Optimization (SEO). This 
discipline involves a number of alterations to your site, including the way it presents 
content, in order to get high ranking results on search terms.

Configuring the Site
[ 76 ]
Two things Mambo can help you with are creating search-engine friendly URLs, and 
page titles that are related to the content of the page.
Search engines supposedly have difficulty with page URLs that contain lots of query 
string variables (the form of the URL suggests that the content has been created 
dynamically, and so the page may change again soon). For example, the URLs on a 
typical Mambo site look something like:
http://sitename.com/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&i
d=13&Itemid=27
which contains several query string URLs. Setting Search Engine Friendly URLs to 
Yes means that links like the one above would now be in a form like this:
http://sitename.com/mambo/content/view/13/27/
Basically, the query string variables have now become part of the "path" to the page, 
and Mambo is able to work out which variable is which based on its order in 
this "path".
If you select Yes for Search Engine Friendly URLs, then you will prompted when 
you save your settings to rename the .htaccess.txt file in the root of your Mambo 
installation to .htaccess. This file is used by the Apache web server to "prepare" 
the search engine friendly URLs into a form that can be processed by Mambo. If 
you are running on Windows, you might find it unusually difficult to rename the 
.htaccess.txt file to .htaccess. You may find it easiest to open the file in a text 
editor, and then save it with the new name of .htaccess (note the dot in front of 
htaccess here!).
The Dynamic Page Titles option is best left to Yes since this means that Mambo 
should put the title of the current content item into the page title bar in your browser. 
This page title will also be in a search engine listing when the page is found by the 
engine in response to some search term.
Away from the SEO tab, Mambo can also help with further aspects of search 
engine optimization.

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
Metadata
The Metadata tab allows you to create meta description and keyword tags that 
appear in the <head> of the HTML page output. These tags are used (to a certain 
extent) by Internet search engines.
<head>
<title>Zak Springs Golf Club</title>
<meta name="description" 
      content="Mambo - the dynamic portal engine and content 
management system" />
<meta name="keywords" content="mambo, Mambo" />
For example, the text in the description tag will be displayed by certain search 
engines when a result is returned from your site. The keywords tag is where you 
would list keywords or keyword phrases that relate specifically to the content on the 
page. However, it is generally held that search engines are not too fussed about this 
tag anymore; but there's no harm in putting keywords in anyway! Do not overdo the 
keywords, since many search engines simply view this as keyword "spam", and will 
not look kindly upon on your page.
You fill up the meta tags in your page by using the values from the fields in the 
Metadata tab:
These values are "global", in the sense that they apply to your whole site, so 
the keywords and description here should reflect your site as a whole, and not 
individual pages. Keywords and a description can be added for individual content 
items as we'll see later.

Configuring the Site
[ 78 ]
Private Messages
The Private Messages feature of the Mambo back end allows you to send messages to 
other back end users. Each back-end user is provided with an "inbox" where they can 
see and reply to private messages that have been sent to them.
Private messages are also used by Mambo to notify various back-end users when 
content items have been submitted to the site.
The configuration for private messaging is done from the Messages | Configuration 
administrator menu option. There are two options; one is to send an email 
notification when a private message arrives (the default is to send), and the other 
locks your inbox (the default is Yes):
The Lock Inbox setting really should say "Receive 
Messages". If you set Lock Inbox to No, then you will find 
that you cannot receive Private Messages! To make sure 
you can receive Private Messages, you must set Lock Inbox 
to Yes.
For this exercise, make sure Mail me on new Message is set to Yes, and then click 
the Save icon in the toolbar to save the settings. Until you save the configuration 
settings, they are not actually stored in the database. The settings you see when you 
first go to the page are just default settings, and not your current values. Once you 
save the settings and they are stored in the database, they will function properly. If 
you do not save any changes to the configuration, you will receive private messages, 
but you will not be notified by email when they arrive.
Now we're configured, let's send a message. Select Messages | Inbox from the 
administrator drop-down menu, and you'll see your Private Messages Inbox. It's not 
much to look at right now, you don't have any messages! Click the New button in 
the toolbar, and we'll proceed to send ourselves a message.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
Select your username from the To drop-down box, and enter a Subject, and some 
text in the Message field. After this, click the Send button in the toolbar, and your 
message is sent to yourself. You will see the received message in your Private 
Messages Inbox, from where you can delete it, read it and then delete, or reply to it.
Also, if you open up your mail client and check your mail, you should find a 
message from your site with the subject A new private message has arrived. 
Intriguingly, the body of the mail is also A new private message has arrived. If you 
don't receive this mail, then check your mail server setup from the Mail tab of the 
Global Configuration, and then send yourself another private message.
Summary
This has been a short chapter, since we've only been concerned with one activity, 
exploring the basic configuration options of a Mambo site.
We started the chapter by creating a fresh Mambo installation, called zaksprings. 
This installation will be added to as we go through the chapters, building up our Zak 
Springs website.
We looked at the global configuration options from the Site | Global Configuration 
administration menu option. These options are presented in a tabbed format, and 
require JavaScript to be working in your browser to function properly. Once you 
make changes to the configuration options, the configuration.php file in the root 
of your Mambo installation is updated, which means that PHP must be able to write 
to this file. Failure to write to the file will display warnings.
The global configuration options control a number of properties of the site, such as 
the name of the site, how the mail server is set up, how long items should be stored 
in the cache, and what form the URLs of pages should be.
We concluded the chapter with a look at the Private Messages functionality. This 
is used not only by back-end users to send messages to other back-end users, it is 
also used by Mambo to send system notifications to various administrators, so it's 
important to have this set up and ready to go. Our look at the Private Messages feature 
was also used as a quick test to see if our mail server configuration was correct.


Managing Media, Modules, 
and Components
In this chapter, we'll look at module and component administration. With Mambo, 
you can configure the modules as a whole; their position on the page, who can see 
them, and so on. Also, the modules themselves are configurable, which allows you to 
control whether the title of the module is displayed on the page, and also make some 
settings specific to that module.
After that, we'll see an overview of component management, although management 
of individual components is a topic that will occupy much of the rest of the book. 
We'll have a look at the Universal Installer, which allows you to install any type of 
Mambo add-on with ease.
Before we move on to module and component management, we'll start with a quick 
look at the Media Manager. This allows you to add files directly to the server, for use 
in your content items.
Managing Media
The Media Manager allows you to upload resources (images, PDF, and Office 
documents) that can be used (linked to) in your content. To help with organizing 
these resources, the Media Manager allows you to create directories on the server. 
The Media Manager allows you to upload images in either GIF, PNG, JPEG, or 
Windows BMP format, PDF documents, Flash movies (SWF format), and Microsoft 
Office documents (Word documents (.doc), Excel spreadsheets (.xls), and 
PowerPoint presentations (.ppt)). The type of the file is determined from 
its extension.
Note that you cannot use the Media Manager to upload plain text files to the server.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 82 ]
The Media Manager can be accessed from Site | Media Manager.
Here you can see a gallery of the images and other resources currently stored in this 
"root" folder. You can upload a new media resource to the folder by clicking the 
Browse button, selecting the file you want to upload, and then clicking the Upload 
button to send the file to the server.
You can create a new directory on the server by entering its name into the Create 
Directory field and then clicking Create in the toolbar.
The "root" directory for this store of media resources is the stories folder within the 
images folder of your Mambo installation. This means that any directory you create 
in the Media Manager will become subdirectory of the images\stories folder. Note 
also that you cannot upload any resources using the Media Manager to any folder 
above images\stories. You can change to a new directory in the Media Manager 
structure by selecting it from the Directory drop-down box.
Note that creating a new directory inside your "root" directory requires Mambo to 
have full write access to the images\stories folder. We talk more about setting 
up these permissions in Chapter 12. On your local testing machine, you should not 
encounter problems with permissions on this folder.

Chapter 5
[ 83 ]
If you click on the image of the resource in the Media Manager, the HTML to add a 
link to this resource will appear in the Code field. (Clicking on the pencil icon of the 
resource will also make this HTML appear.)
Clicking the trash icon under the resource thumbnail allows you to delete that 
resource from the server. You will be prompted to confirm your decision before 
the file is deleted. The file will be removed from the server if you choose to go 
ahead with this action. Since you can only operate on files or folders within the 
images\stories folder in your Mambo installation, you can't delete any important 
Mambo files with this feature!
Before going any further in the chapter, we'll try out the Media Manager by 
uploading an image to the server. You can find the Zak Springs logo image 
(zaksprings_logo.png) in this chapter of the code download, so get it ready.
Select the Media Manager from Site | Media Manager. Click the Browse button, 
and then navigate to the Zak Springs logo graphic (I told you to have it ready), and 
select it. After that, click the Upload button in the toolbar, and your image will be 
uploaded to the server, and displayed with the other images:

ging Mod����
ules
Modules are a key part of the layout and operation of a typical Mambo website. You 
can customize the individual properties of a module, and also choose where and 
how the module is displayed on the page.
Installed Modules
Module management begins from the Modules section of the administration menu:

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 84 ]
The Review/Uninstall menu option displays the list of modules that are currently 
installed on your system:
This list provides some basic information about the installed modules, and allows 
you to uninstall a module by selecting the radio button the left of the module 
file name, and then clicking the Uninstall icon in the toolbar. Be careful; this will 
physically remove the module files from the module folder. In other words, it will 
remove the module from the server. A module actually has a pair of files that go in 
the modules folder. One of these files is a PHP code file, the other is a configuration 
file. The filename corresponding to a particular module is shown in the Module 
File column.
There are two types of module, Site and Admin. Site modules are for the front end 
(the publicly visible portion) of your site, and Admin modules are only used on the 
back end of the site. You can use the Filter drop-down box if you only want to view 
one of these types of module.
Note that this list of modules is only a list of the physical module files stored on the 
server; it's not the actual list of modules displayed on your site. There isn't much you 
can do with this list other than delete files from the server. To really do things with 
modules, we need to move to the Module Manager.

Chapter 5
[ 85 ]
Managing Site Modules
Select the Modules | Site Modules menu option to visit the Module Manager, and 
begin the administration of the front-end modules of your site.
Now this really is a list of the modules on your site. Each of these is an "instance" 
of a module that we saw in the Installed Modules list. Instance here means an 
individual "object" based on the "parent" code. Once the instance has been created, 
it can be given its own configuration, and you can have several module instances of 
the same "parent" code on your site. You can see the "parent" code that the module is 
an instance of from its Type column. The value in this column indicates the code file 
that is the module's "parent".
You should be familiar with many of the columns in the table from the last chapter. 
We saw the Published, Reorder, Order, and Access columns in the Frontpage 
Manager, and discussed what those concepts meant in relation to content items 
there. We also mentioned that these concepts applied generally throughout Mambo, 
and here we're seeing proof of that already. Modules can be activated (published), 
reordered, or restricted to certain groups of users by editing values in these columns.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 86 ]
Exactly what "reordering" means in this module context, we'll be exploring in 
a minute.
The Position and Pages columns suggest that there are two dimensions to the 
location of a module:
Where on those pages is it displayed?
Which page(s) is it displayed on?
The Pages column may not look quite so helpful, as it seems to have only the values of 
All, None, or Varies. That suggests that a module can appear on all pages, no pages, 
or some pages, which is probably what you would have guessed anyway! We'll have 
to look more closely at the individual module to find out what Varies means exactly. 
It doesn't really mean Varies, it actually means "Some". It doesn't mean the module 
appears on one page on Tuesday, and another page on Wednesday!
The Position column specifies one of the "module positions" for the module to be 
displayed in. These are various places on the page (their exact location is specified 
in the template) where sets of modules can be displayed. Select the Site | Preview | 
Inline with Positions menu option to see the placement of module positions:
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
We haven't added the boxes onto this image ourselves (except to emphasize their 
outline), in fact Mambo has actually drawn these for you. Each of these boxes is a 
module position, and the name of the position is shown in the box.
If you click the Back button in your browser to return to the Module Manager page 
(or refer to the earlier screenshot), you will be able to build a mental picture of the 
page from looking at the value of the module in the Position column, and checking 
where that position is on the Preview | Inline with Positions map. For example, the 
Main menu and User menu have the position of left, so these will be displayed in the 
left-hand column of the page.
The Position of the module goes with the Order of the module. The order of the 
module actually means "order within that position". Reordering a module means 
moving it up or down within the set of other modules that are displayed in the 
same position as that module. The module with the lowest order value (1) will be 
displayed first in that position, the one with the next highest order is shown next, 
and so on. Note that a checked-out module can't be reordered directly, although you 
can move it by moving the module above or below it.
You can use the drop-down box with All Positions in it to view only the modules 
that are in a particular position.
From our experience with the Frontpage Manager in the previous chapter, we know 
that we can click in the Published column of a module to publish or unpublish it. An 
unpublished module is never seen on the public side of your site. You can also check 
the boxes next to the module titles, and click the Publish or Unpublish toolbar icons 
to affect several modules in one go.
Clicking on the arrows in the Reorder column moves a module one position up or 
down, and clicking in the Access column toggles the user access restrictions for 
that module.
One thing that may initially disorientate you is, when 
there is more than one page of modules, and you make 
some changes to a module on a page after the first one. For 
example, say you deactivate (unpublish) a module. After 
you click to deactivate the module, you will find yourself 
back on the first page of the list, and the module you were 
just looking at is nowhere to be seen on the current page. 
You will have to click the paging links to get back to the 
page that had your module.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 88 ]
The paging links are displayed under the list of modules (and generally in Mambo 
you will find paging links at the bottom of a list in the administration area). The 
current page is highlighted (in the image below we are on the second page, so 2 is 
highlighted), and there are links to each of the available pages, and also to the next or 
previous page:
The number of elements to display on one of the pages is controlled from the 
Display # drop-down box.
Editing Module Properties
You can edit the properties of a particular module by clicking on its name. This 
brings you to the Site Module: Edit page. Let's click on the Login Form module for 
now, and see what comes up:

Chapter 5
[ 89 ]
There are three panels on this page, Details, Pages/Items, and Parameters.
Module Details
The Details panel holds the module properties that we saw displayed in the Module 
Manager table: the Title, the Position, the Module Order, the Access Level, and the 
Published State of the module.
Something that you can't get from the table in the Module Manager is the Show 
Title field. Remember we saw the Search module in the previous chapter, and 
mentioned that it seemed to have no title—no banner saying Search. Remember I 
also said you could control that? Well, you do that with the Show Title field. 
Setting it to No will mean the module is displayed without its title, as the Search 
module was.
The Access Level field allows you to show the module to anyone (Public), logged-in 
users (Registered), or one of the other front-end user groups we will meet in Chapter 
7 (Special):
Pages/Items
The Pages/Items panel explains the All, None, Varies values for the Pages column in 
the Module Manager. From this panel, you set the pages on which the module will 
appear. Select the All entry, and the module will appear on every page; select None 
and it will not appear on any page on your site.
If you want the module to appear on only some pages, then you simply need to 
select those pages. You select multiple pages in the way you usually select multiple 
items on your computer (on Windows for example, hold down the Ctrl key as you 
click on each page you want).
Actually, you don't see all the pages on the site in the Pages/Items panel; you only 
see the menu entries. We'll talk more about menu entries in the next chapter, but 
for now, we'll just say that menu entries point to pages. However, there will be 
more pages on your site than have menu entries, and as we'll see, certain pages will 
"inherit" settings from their parent page, which will have a menu entry.
Currently, since our database is pretty empty, there are only two menu entries, 
mainmenu | Home and mainmenu | Advanced Search. If you have a look at your 
previous installation, with the sample data, you will see that there are more menu 
entries, and more pages to add the module to.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 90 ]
The image here shows the Pages/Items panel from our previous, sample data 
installation. We've selected the Mambo and Security menu entry.
If you do the same, click Save, preview the site, and browse to the FAQs | Mambo 
and Security menu entry, you will see that Login Form is indeed displayed on the 
page. Now click on one of the item titles displayed on that page, and you will see 
that the Login Form is still displayed on this new page. This is because this page 
inherits the Login Form module from its "parent". In this way, modules can be added 
to pages that are not directly linked to from the menus.
Module Parameters
The panels we've just seen are the same for every module. What you see in the 
Parameters panel depends on the module you are working with. This panel handles 
the configuration specific to that type of module. Here we see the Parameters for the 
Login Form module:

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
Most of these fields are specific to the Login Form module. They allow you to do 
things like choose the text that is displayed before the Username box to customize 
the Login Form module. Again, there are little i icons for you to hover the cursor 
over to get field-specific help information. If you make changes to these fields, you 
will need to click Save or Apply in the toolbar to persist your changes.
The Module Class Suffix generally appears in most 
module Parameters. This allows you to specify a string 
that will be placed on the end of all the CSS class names in 
the output of the module. With this suffix, the classnames 
used in the module output can be unique, which means 
that you can define CSS styles specifically for this module, 
which can give your module an extra level of visual 
customization.
Note that if you click the Back button while editing module details, or leave the page 
by some other means, that module will be checked out, and the familiar padlock icon 
will appear next to the module in the Module Name table.
When a module is checked out, you can't publish, and you can't re-order it, although 
if you move the module above it down (or the one below up), then the module will 
move by itself!

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 92 ]
All of this means that there are three aspects to module management:
General module details: its name, where it’s displayed on the page, who 
can see it
Which pages it is displayed on
Configuration specific to that type of module
All of this can be done from the Site Module: Edit page. This "general" and "specific" 
control over a module makes Mambo modules extremely flexible.
Adding a New Module Instance to your Site
You can add a new module instance to your site in of one two ways: you can either 
use an existing module as a "template", or you can create a more basic module. The 
first way involves "copying" a module, the second is simpler. The words "template" 
and "copying" here could give the impression that this is a rather involved process, 
but it isn't. It simply involves a couple of clicks in the Module Manager and 
you're away.
Creating a basic module offers limited functionality for the module. It can do 
these things:
Display RSS feeds from other sites
Display custom HTML stored in the database
We'll create two new modules. The first will display a news feed of golf headlines 
from the BBC Sport website, and the other will display the Zak Springs logo using 
simply HTML.
Adding an RSS Feed Module
From the Module Manager, click the New button in the toolbar. This brings up the 
New module page. We'll begin by entering the title of the module, BBC Golf News, 
but we'll also set it to not display this title:
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
We will leave the other fields in the Details panel as they are.
Click the Apply button in the toolbar to save our changes before we move on. You 
will see this text displayed below the toolbar once the page reloads:
Now scroll down the screen to the Parameters panel. We enter the URL of the RSS 
news feed, http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/sportonline_world_edition/golf/
rss.xml into the RSS URL field, and we set the other options as follows:
We don't want to show the feed description, as this is quite a long piece of text, 
which will make the module take up a lot of space, and we won't show the feed 
image either for the same reasons. We also set the Item Description to No so as only 
to show the headline of the story. The Item Description will again be a chunk of text 
that bloats the size of our module.
Finally, we set Enable Cache to Yes. This means that the output of the module 
will be cached. By doing this, our site will not have to make a request to the target 
website to grab the RSS feed every time the module is displayed. (We don't really 
need to make a fresh request all the time, as we don't require the information to be 
completely up to the minute). Removing this overhead will make our page display 
faster, and reduce the overall load on our system.
Note that the caching of the RSS feed will still work even 
if the global site caching is not enabled. The data from the 
RSS feed is cached using a different caching "engine", and 
the cache will remain fresh for an hour. There isn't any way 
to change this value directly from the administration area 
of Mambo.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 94 ]
Click Apply in the toolbar to save the changes and continue working. There is one 
more thing to do.
The final activity is to set which pages this module will be displayed on. This is done 
from the Pages/Items panel (above and to the right of the Parameters panel). We 
will set the module to display only on the homepage. We do this by selecting the 
mainmenu | Home option:
That's it. Click the Save button in the toolbar, and you will return to the Module 
Manager. Your first module is now displayed in the list of site modules:
You will note from the Type column that this module is of type User. This is because 
it isn't based on any of the installed custom modules.
Now if you preview your site, you will see your module at the top of the 
left-hand column:

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
This was of course the news from that feed at the time of writing; you will very likely 
see something different, unless the world of golf has drawn to a complete standstill 
since this moment. Click on any of these links and you will be taken to the relevant 
story on the BBC News website, with the story opening in a new browser window.
Adding a Custom HTML Module
This time we'll enter some HTML that will be used directly for the module output. 
This will be stored in Mambo's database, and retrieved and displayed when the 
module is output on the page. Such an HTML module cannot take advantage of any 
"server-side" PHP processing, so the output is always fixed. The module output will 
always look the same, whenever you look at it, whoever you are.
To get started, you click the New button in the toolbar of the Module Manager 
(again!). We'll start with the module details, we'll give it a title of Zak Springs Logo, 
and again set the title to not be visible as we did above.
This time, scroll down past the Parameters panel to find the Custom Output panel:
This panel contains a single HTML editor, for a field called Content. This is where 
we enter the HTML for our module. We aren't even going to type in any text; we're 
just going to insert an image. We're going to add the Zak Springs logo that we 
uploaded to the server earlier in the chapter with the Media Manager. If you didn't 
do it then, now is a good time to go back and do that!
Prior to version 4.6 of Mambo, there was a feature that allowed you to browse 
through your media in the HTML editor, and select the image to insert. From 4.6 
onwards, this feature has been relegated to a plug-in rather than a standard feature, 
and currently it has not been completed. This is a shame, since it means that you 
have to know the URL of the image you want to insert before you start attempting 
to add it.
For our logo image, its path on the server will be 
images\stories\zaksprings_logo.png, so we'll just have to remember that.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 96 ]
Click the Insert/edit image icon in the HTML editor:
A dialog pops up, where you have to enter the URL of our image (images/stories/
zaksprings_long.png) into the Image URL field (note the / character in the path for 
the URL instead of the \ character for the file path), and add a title and description 
as below:
After that, click the Insert button; the dialog will close, and the image will be added 
to the Content field. Click on the newly inserted image, then click the centering icon 
in the text editor to centre the image:

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
Click the Save icon in the toolbar, and you'll return to the Module Manager. Our 
new logo module is now shown in the list of modules:
You will notice that the module has been placed below the BBC Golf News module 
we created previously (we can move it up if we like with the reordering arrows) and 
that it is also of type User. We left the logo module to be displayed on All pages; that 
is the default value in the Pages/Item panel.
Preview the site, and the logo can be seen in all its glory:
That's all there is to creating a module to show a piece of custom HTML. The HTML 
we used was very simple, only consisting of a single image reference, but of course it 
can be more complex (and useful!) than this.
Note you can combine an RSS feed module and a custom 
HTML module. Enter the details for the RSS feed into the 
Parameters panel, and enter some text into the Content 
field of the Custom Output panel, and both will be 
displayed. The HTML from the Custom Output panel will 
always be displayed before the start of the RSS news feed.
Creating a Module Copy
The other way to add a new module instance is to base your module on an existing 
one. This is done by "copying" one of the current site modules. "Copy" actually means 
"create a blank copy"; all the values of the fields of your new module are reset to their 
default state, and your module copy will have the same fields as the source module.
We'll create a copy of the Random Image module. This module shows an image at 
random from a folder of your choosing. We'll use this module to show thumbnails of 
some of the holes at Zak Springs.
First of all, grab the thumbnails of the holes at Zak Springs from this chapter in the 
code download, create a folder called holes in the images folder of your Mambo 
installation, and copy all the images into there. (Alternatively, you can upload the 

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 98 ]
thumbnails with the Media Manager; create a folder called holes with the Media 
Manager, and then upload the images.)
Creating a module copy begins by selecting your source module. If you can't find 
the type of module you're after, you can use the drop-down box with All Types in 
it to filter for a particular type of module. The Random Image module is of type 
mod_random_image, so select that from the drop-down box and the module you're 
after will be shown:
Check the box next to the name of the module, and click the Copy button from 
the toolbar.
After you click Copy, you might be surprised to not be confronted with a Site 
Module: Edit page. Instead, you're still in the Module Manager, and you will see 
this text below the toolbar:
Filter again by mod_random_image and you will discover your newly 
copied module:

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
Note that our copy is unpublished. Regardless of whether the module we copied is 
published or not, our copy will always be unpublished by default. We will have to 
set it to Published once we are finished with it.
Now you can click on the Copy of Random Image module name and actually start 
editing your module:
The title has already been conveniently created for you (very cleverly the words 
Copy of were added to the front of the title of the module you copied).
We'll change the Title to Holes at Zak Springs, and also set the Position to left. You 
will note that as soon as you change the position, the Module Order dropdown will 
change, to display only the modules that are in the left position. We will also change 
the position, so that this module is displayed after the Zak Springs Logo. We'll set 
the dropdown to 2.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 100 ]
Set the Published field to Yes, so that the module will be displayed as soon as we 
finish entering our details.
Scroll down the screen to the Parameters panel. The only thing we need to specify is 
the Image Folder; this needs to point to the folder containing the images from which 
the random selection will be made. We use a relative URL for this, rather than the 
full http://localhost/ form of the URL, since Mambo will add the path to our live 
site onto the front of the URL anyway. Enter images/holes/ into this field. (If you 
followed the alternative suggestion above and uploaded the images using the Media 
Manager, the path you need to enter will be images/stories/holes/.) 
We could specify a Width for the images to be resized to when displayed, and if no 
width is specified, the width will be set to 100 pixels. Note that no thumbnail of this 
size is generated; the images in the folder you have specified will be displayed to the 
visitor, and simply resized in the browser. If you have large images, even though the 
visitor sees them at a smaller size, the large images have already been downloaded 
for the visitor, so this can make your page load slower. The images supplied in the 
code download are already thumbnail-sized.
After entering the information, click the Save icon in the toolbar, and our module 
copy is fully done.
When you preview your site now, you will see the random image:
If the image is not displayed, edit the module details and check the Image 
Folder field.
If you click Refresh, a new image will be displayed (probably... it is random!).
This Random Image module is very rudimentary—we had to add our own specially 
prepared thumbnails to the image, and then there isn't really much for the user to do 
other than look at the image. It would be good if they could click the image to see a 
full-size version of it. This will all be made much easier when we use the specially 
created module for the zOOm Gallery in Chapter 10.
That just about wraps up our discussion of adding new modules to the site; now we 
can move on to deleting module instances.

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
Deleting Module Instances
To create a copy of a module, there needs to be an instance of that module already 
defined on the site (it need not be published of course). That does mean that if you 
delete the last remaining instance of a particular module, you won't be able to create 
a new one.
This does seem to be the case. In fact, worse than that, delete the last remaining 
instance of a module from the site and the module itself will be uninstalled.
So watch out! Unless you have a good reason to delete a module, it is best to leave a 
module unpublished and simply ignore it. You never know when you may want to 
use it again!
Administrator Modules
So far we've looked at the Site Modules option of the Modules menu, which controls 
the modules that appear on the front end of your site.
As you would expect, the Administrator Modules option allows you to control the 
modules that appear in the administration area.
The Administrator Modules are different from the site modules in terms of the type 
of functionality they offer, and where they are stored in the Mambo file structure. 
Moreover, very few administrator modules offer their configuration parameters. 
Also, there is no option to display the modules on certain pages; administrator 
modules are displayed on all pages of the administration area.
However, the templates that control the administration area do not usually make use 
of such a wide range of module positions as the site modules.
The Administrator Module management page, obtained by selecting the Modules | 
Administration Modules option on the administration menu, works in an identical 
fashion to the Site Module management page, and you can bring the skills that you 
learned from our exploration of that page to bear on the Administration Module 
management page.
One difference is that if you want to create a new administrator module, there is no 
option for an RSS feed module; you can either create a module consisting purely of 
HTML, or else copy an existing administrator module to create a new instance. You 
cannot copy a site module to create a new instance of an administrator module, and 
there is probably little reason you would want to. Site Modules are designed for the 
front end of the site, for visitors, and Administrator Modules are designed for the 
back end of the site, for administrators.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 102 ]
The main module positions for administrator modules are:
cpanel: the tabbed element in the Control Panel on the administrator 
home-page. Selecting a module with this position will add a new tab to that 
element on the administrator homepage. A module in this position is only 
shown on the administrator homepage.
top: where the administration menu is displayed. A module in this position 
will be shown on "most of" the pages of the administration area.
header: to the right side of the top position, where the number of online 
users is displayed�.
Component Management
Components are the main units of our site's functionality, but there isn't really much 
to do for their general management. Unlike modules, which have properties like 
position, pages, and so on to set, components can either be installed or uninstalled 
from the Components | Review/Uninstall menu option, and that's about all you do 
with components in general:
•
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
Management and configuration of the components themselves is done from the 
Components menu. Each component that has any kind of configuration will 
provide a menu entry on this menu, and you use that to set up that component in 
the way you want. This is specific to each different component, and we will talk 
about configuring individual components when we look at the functionality of that 
component in the coming chapters.
Install���������������������������
ing Mambo Add-ons with the 
Universa�����������
l Installer
In Mambo 4.6 onwards, there is a new "universal" installer that allows you to install a 
component, a module, a template, a mambot, or other feature of Mambo easily from 
a single place.
Mambo add-ons are packaged up into a single ZIP file, and this is done by the person 
or individual who produced the add-on; this isn't something you have to do.
This ZIP archive contains all the files required for that add-on, and unlike many 
other systems where installing add-ons requires you to copy lots of different files 
into different places on your server, installing a Mambo add-on with the Universal 
Installer simply requires you to upload this single ZIP file onto the server running 
your Mambo site. Mambo will automatically put the required files into the right 
place, and advise of any errors.
You upload the file from the Installers | Universal page. Whatever type of add-on 
you want to install, Mambo will work it out once you upload the file.
The easiest way to install an add-on is with the Upload Package File panel on the 
Installers | Universal page:

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 104 ]
You click the Browse button and navigate (on your local machine) to the ZIP file 
containing the add-on you want to install, click the Upload File & Install button, and 
the file will be uploaded to the server. Mambo will extract the contents of the ZIP file, 
work out what type of add-on you've uploaded, and begin the process of copying the 
files to the correct place on the server. If the file you upload isn't a Mambo add-on 
you will be advised of this and nothing will be copied into your Mambo installation.
For this to work, it does mean that Mambo will need to be able to write to the folder 
into which the add-on is being placed. You can see the write status of all the Mambo 
folders on the Installer | Universal page. While attempting to install any add-on, if 
the installation process cannot write to any folder it needs to, an error message will 
be displayed, and the installation will not succeed.
Installing Directly from a URL
In fact, you don't even have to get the ZIP file yourself and upload it to the server. 
If you know the URL from where an add-on can be downloaded, you can simply 
point Mambo towards that URL, and it will download the ZIP file itself, extract, and 
distribute the files accordingly. It couldn't be easier!

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
This does mean that you have to know what you're downloading. You could 
be downloading absolutely anything to your server. For example, you could be 
downloading a component that seems to work fine, but it could have replaced the 
login component with something that sends passwords off to some evil location on 
the Internet (I hope I haven't given anyone an idea there...).
While such things might seem far fetched, if you are not downloading from 
somewhere that you completely trust, it may be wise to download the ZIP file 
manually and check it out yourself, and it's worth doing this for any add-on that you 
install using the ordinary method we just described as well. The same risks apply; 
the difference between the URL method and the previous method is that with the 
URL method you have no opportunity to look at what you're installing before its 
get installed.
Having mentioned all that doom and gloom, one thing that installing from URL 
is great for is downloading Mambo add-ons from the MamboXchange website, 
especially the add-ons for Mambo Lite.
Installing the ExtCal Event Component
The ExtCal event component adds a calendar to the front end of your site, to which 
users and administrators can add events. At Zak Springs, this component will be 
used to provide a calendar of up-coming club events, such as tournaments. We'll talk 
more about using the calendar in a later chapter, but for now, let's get it installed!
The ExtCal Event component can be downloaded from:
http://mamboxchange.com/projects/extcalendar/
If you enter this URL into your browser, you will be taken to this component's page 
on the MamboXchange website, where you will see some links to download it:

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 106 ]
The component also comes with some supporting modules; we'll install one of them 
in a moment. Click the Download link for the ExtCalendar Component and you will 
see the released files for this package. The most recent stable version is highlighted:
Click the link for ExtCalendar_Component_v0.9.1.zip and the file will begin 
downloading to your hard drive.
Once the file has finished downloading, return to your Mambo administration area, 
and select Installers | Universal from the administration menu:
Click the Browse button next to the Package File field, and navigate to the ZIP file 
you just downloaded, select it, and then click Upload File & Install.
When the page reloads, you will see a long message about the installed component, 
which begins like this:

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
Scroll down the screen, and you will see the successful upload information:
If something has gone wrong with the installation, you will be advised of that here. 
Any problem with the installation will be reported.
Click the Continue link to return to your component administration. You will 
now be able to see that the ExtCal component has been added to the Components 
administration drop-down menu:
Installing an ExtCal Module from a URL
Now we've got the ExtCal component, let's download the Latest Events Module 
to go with it. This time, we'll install the component directly from its location on the 
MamboXchange website.
If you return to the homepage of the ExtCal add-on at the MamboXchange website, 
and this time click the Download link for the ExtCal Latest Events Module, you'll 
see the list of files for the module:

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 108 ]
Rather than clicking the ExtCalendar_LatestEventsModule_v0.7.2.zip link to 
download the ZIP file, we'll need the full URL of the link. This can be obtained 
directly from your browser:
In Firefox, right-click the link and select Copy Link Location from the 
pop-up menu. This will copy the full URL of the link to your clipboard.
In Internet Explorer, you can right-click on the link and select Copy Shortcut, 
and the full URL of the link will be copied to your clipboard.
In the Opera browser, you can do the same by right-clicking the link and 
selecting Copy link address.
In other browsers, you can get the URL of a link in a similar way. Once you've got a 
copy of the full URL of the link, return to the Universal Installer page, and then paste 
the link into the Install HTTP URL field:
Once you've done this, click the Upload URL & Install button. When the page 
reloads, you'll see the upload success message:
Click the Continue link. If you return to the Module Manager page (Modules | Site 
Modules), you can see the newly installed module in your list of modules:

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
Both ways of installing these add-ons were pretty straightforward. Installing from 
the URL required us to grab the URL of the ZIP file we wanted, which we could do 
straight from our browser.
The installer has made a rather tedious process very simple. Installing a Mambo 
add-on would otherwise require copying files to a range of different places in the 
Mambo installation, adding some new tables to the database, and then updating 
some existing tables. It's much easier to just put in the URL of the package you want 
to download and click a button!
Int�����������������
erlude: Web �����
Links
The Web Links component provides a repository for links (unsurprisingly) 
organized into categories. For each link, you provide a URL, the target for the link, a 
name for the link, and a description of the link.
For the Zak Springs site we will use the Web Links component to create a simple 
directory of local hotels and other leisure partners. The link will point to the website 
of the relevant business to enable visitors to the course to book accommodation.
For now, we'll create one category, called Hotels within 10 Kilometres, and add a 
single link to that category for the Hotel De Fear.
Creating Web Link Categories
To create a Web Link category, select Components | Web Link | Web Link 
categories, and then click the New button in the toolbar.
Now enter Hotels within 10 Kilometres into the Category Title and Category Name 
fields. Leave the other options as they are. Scroll down and enter Quality hotels 
within 10 kilometres of Zak Springs Golf Club into the Description field:

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 110 ]
After entering these details, click the Save button in the toolbar.
Your first category can now be seen:

Chapter 5
[ 111 ]
Creating Web Links
Now we can create a link to go in this category.
Select Components | Web Links | Web Link Items from the administrator menu, 
and click the New button in the toolbar.
Enter Hotel De Fear into the Name category, select the category we just created from 
the Category drop-down box, and enter www.hoteldefear.com into the URL field. In 
the Description field, enter something like:
4 star accommodation in picturesque hamlet of Draxville
167 Darkness Boulevard
Draxville
Leave the other options as they are, and click the Save button in the toolbar. Your 
newly created Web Link can be seen:
That'll do for now. That's given us a quick experience of managing other components. 
Since Web Links comes with Mambo you would expect it to behave in a very similar 
way to Mambo in general, and it does. The process we've just gone through to enter 
data is one that we will be doing over and over again in our Mambo lives.
Summary
In this chapter we looked at managing media, modules, and components.
Mambo has a Media Manager that allows you to upload directly to the server 
without the need for a separate FTP client. We used the Media Manager to upload 
the logo for Zak Springs golf club.
Next we looked at module management. Modules are generally PHP files that go in 
the modules folder of your Mambo installation, and the actual modules on the site 
are "instances" of these bits of codes.

Managing Media, Modules, and Components
[ 112 ]
We saw three aspects to module management:
General module details: its name, where it’s displayed on the page, who can 
see it
Which pages it is displayed on
Configuration specific to that type of module
We also created a couple of new module instances. We created an RSS feed module 
to grab some golf headlines, a custom HTML module to display the Zak Springs 
logo, and then created a copy of the Random Images module to display some holes 
from the Zak Springs golf course.
We looked at component management next. In general, there isn't much to general 
component management, and the management of individual components is really 
the key to managing your Mambo site, and we'll spend time on that over the 
remaining chapters. We concluded the chapter with a quick look at the Web Links 
component, to add details of hotels near to the Zak Springs course.
We also looked at Mambo's powerful Universal Installer. This allows you to install 
any kind of Mambo add-on from a single page, and provides a range of different 
ways of installing the add-on. We looked at the basic way, whereby you select the 
package containing the add-on (a ZIP file), and it is uploaded to the server, and 
Mambo takes care of the rest. We also saw how to install an add-on directly from a 
remote URL. This is certainly a feature for the future for Mambo, since it does open 
up the possibility of remote updating of add-ons on your site, to keep them up to 
date in the same way that your virus checker keeps itself up to date. Mambo isn't 
there yet, but there is a definite possibility for that in the future.

Managing Menus and 
Templates
In this chapter, we will look at managing menus and templates. Menus contain links 
to pages on your site, but more than that, these links also control the way the page 
will be displayed. Mastering Mambo's menu management is a must to making your 
site useful for visitors. We'll also have a look at the proposed menu structure for 
Zak Springs.
Templates control the look and layout of your site pages. Later in this chapter we'll 
have a quick look at how to select different templates, and assign them to different 
pages on the site.
Menus
Without �������������������������������������������������������������������������������

menus, visitors will have a very difficult time finding anything on your site.
You can see all the menus currently set up on your site from the Menu | Menu 
Manager option of the administrator menu:

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 114 ]
 
From here you can rename the menus by clicking on their titles (or checking in the 
box next to the title and clicking the Edit icon), delete menus, or create a copy of an 
existing menu.
If you click the graphic in the Menu Items column, you can begin editing the 
individual menu items of a particular menu.
Alternatively, you can get to the menu items of a particular menu directly by 
selecting its name from the Menu administrator drop-down menu.
We'll start with the mainmenu.
Menu Items
A menu is made up of menu items. Menu items point to pages on your site. 
However, they don't just point to a page, they define how the target page should be 
displayed. This control over the display is determined by the type of the menu item.

Chapter 6
[ 115 ]
Creating a menu item involves two stages.
1.	 Choosing the type of the menu item
2.	 Providing a name for the menu item, and then some configuration specific to 
the type of menu item
After these two stages are complete you are ready to save your menu item.
Be careful! After you have chosen your menu type, done the 
second step, and then saved your menu item, you cannot 
change the menu type, unless you delete it and start all 
over again.
The Menu Manager for the mainmenu currently looks like this:
It's a familiar looking table. You can see the publication state of the menu item, its 
order on the menu, who can access the menu item, and also its Type.
You can configure individual menu items to be visible to the Public, Registered 
users, or Special users.
Who can access the menu as a whole can't be found in 
any of these menu management screens. Since a menu is 
actually a module, access to the whole menu is determined 
by the properties of the corresponding module.

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 116 ]
The modules for the standard menus have names like Main menu (mainmenu), 
Other menu (othermenu) and so on.
Let's get straight into creating a new menu item. We'll create a menu item to point to 
our Web Links.
Click the New button in the toolbar to move to the New Menu Item page to choose 
your menu type:
Menu Item Types
The New Menu Item page has four panels that group the menu types:
Content
Components
Links
Miscellaneous
•
•
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
Within these panels, there are a number of different menu entry types:
Link
Component
Blog
Table
Wrapper
Separator/Placeholder
As we look at the panels, we'll get an idea of what these menu types mean, and 
follow that with an illustration of the difference between the menu types.
Content Menu Type
Menu items created from the types found in the Content panel are for displaying 
content items. The Content panel contains menu entries of type Blog, Link, and 
Table. Content is obviously very important to your site; so that explains why it has 
its own panel! We'll talk about this type of menu items in more detail in Chapter 8, 
when we really get to grips with content management in Mambo.
Components Menu Type
The choices in the Components panel create menu items that allow you to jump 
straight into some part of a component.
The Component option creates a menu entry that takes the user of the site to 
the main page of a particular component.
The Link options create menu entries that take users to a single published 
item in the component (Contact Item and Newsfeed are there by default).
The Table options create menu entries that take users to some "list" in a 
component (Contact, News Feed, and Weblinks are there by default).
Links Menu Type
The choices in the Links panel create menu items of type Link. These take you 
straight to a published item in a component. There is also a Link – Url option that 
allows you to explicitly specify a target URL. This can be used to link to places 
external to your site.
From reading the above paragraph, you would think that the description of the 
Links panel is almost identical to the Link options in the Components panel, and 
you might wonder what the difference is. Essentially, the Links panel is a collection 
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 118 ]
of all the possible Link options, hence you are basically seeing repeated options in 
the Links panel.
If you were to create a Link – Contact Item menu entry from the Links panel, 
and a Link – Contact Item menu entry from the Components panel, and start 
digging around the Mambo database, you would find that there seems to be no 
difference between the way the two are stored, and also that there is no way the 
system could distinguish whether the menu entry came from the Links panel or the 
Components panel.
The important thing to bear in mind is that the Links panel is more or less a "recap" 
of the Link options available in the other panels.
Another thing to bear in mind is that a Link menu entry points to a published item in 
a component, and that likely only that item will be displayed on the page. The menu 
types in the Components panel (such as Table) offer wider views from components, 
such as lists.
Miscellaneous Menu Type 
The first of the two menu types here, Separator / Placeholder, allows you to add a 
separator to your menu, to break the menu items up. The second type, Wrapper, will 
create an IFRAME, which can hold a complete page from another website. This is 
one way that you can "wrap" output of another application or even another website 
to make it look as if it is integrated into your site.
Adding a New Menu Entry
We're going to choose Table – Web Link Category from the Components panel. 
Either click that link, or select the radio button next to it and click the Next button in 
the toolbar.
If you have made some mistake, you can click the Back button in the toolbar and 
change your menu type. If you carry on and click the Save button to save your 
changes, there is no going back!
Add Menu Item Page
The Add Menu Item is the second step of the menu item creation process. Here is the 
page for the Table – Web Link Category.

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
You can see the Details panel, which holds the information about the menu item, 
and the Parameters panel, which holds information specific to the menu type we 
chose. The Parameters panel we see here allows us to show the link descriptions for 
example. We will leave these as they are for now.
A menu item always needs a name, so let's enter Accommodation into the Name 
field. We need to select the category from the Category box, so click on our solitary 
category and it will become highlighted.
The Parent Item allows you to define a hierarchy in your menu. The default is Top, 
which means the menu item is at the top level of the menu. You can nest a menu item 
by selecting another menu item to be the parent from the Parent Item dropdown.
You can determine who can access this menu entry from the Access Level list, by 
selecting one of the user groups. If a visitor does not belong to the required group, 
then, by default, they will not even see the menu entry. This behavior is controlled by 
the Show UnAuthorized Links option on the Site tab of the Global Configuration 
(by default this set to No). Should a visitor find their way to a page corresponding 
to a menu entry that they cannot access, they will see a message of the form: You are 
not authorized to view this resource.

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 120 ]
Let's leave everything else as it is, and click the Save button. Our first new menu 
entry is created:
Now if your preview your site, you will see your new menu item:
Click the Accommodation link, and the list of Web Links (namely the hotels within 
10 kilometres) is displayed:

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
News Feeds Component, Link, Category
Now that we've had an overview of the menu entry types, and seen how to create 
a menu entry, we'll now have a look at an example of the different types of menu 
items that can be created for the Newsfeeds component. In the Components panel, 
there are a couple of options for menu entries linking to parts of the Newsfeeds 
component. These options produce different looking pages, and also, different 
information is required to set up the menu item. Not only that, we will see different 
Parameters panels for the different types of menu items, presenting options relevant 
to that menu item type. 
Note that this example actually works with the sample data site, and does not 
contribute anything to the Zak Springs site.
The Newsfeeds component organizes a list of sites into categories, and when a site is 
selected, the news feed from that site is grabbed and displayed on your site.
In the Components panel, there are two types of menu items for a News Feed:
Link - Newsfeed
Table - News Feed Category
There is also a third type that we can use, Component. As we mentioned earlier, 
this displays the homepage of a component. When you create a menu item of type 
Component, you obviously have to specify the component:
Once you supply the details for the menu item (you must always supply a Name), 
the page on the front end of your site will look something like this:
•
•

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 122 ]
This just shows a list of the available News feed categories. It makes sense that if we 
created a menu item of type Table - News Feed Category, it would display a list of 
sites in a category.
When you create a menu item of type Table - News Feed Category you are 
prompted to select the category from the available list:
Once you select a category, and provide the rest of the details for the menu item, the 
page on the front end of your site will look something like this:

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
This page shows a list of sites within the category (along with the list of other 
categories underneath).
If you were to edit this menu item, you would see that it's Parameters reflect its 
table layout:
Here you can see options to control the way the list of sites in the category is 
displayed. By contrast, the Component menu item previously has no options like 
this in its Parameters panel.
We should be able to predict what will happen with a link of type Link - Newsfeed. 
The page will display the news feed from a single site, and we will be asked to select 
that site from the list when the menu item is created. That's exactly what happens 
when you create a menu item of type Link – Newsfeed:

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 124 ]
After you've selected your site, and filled in the rest of the details for the menu 
item, the page on the front end of the site will look something like this (we selected 
Mambo – MamboXchange):
Exactly as we predicted! Also, the Parameters panel for this menu item is relevant to 
showing the news feed of a single item:

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
Here we see options for displaying the description of the News Feed and so on. 
These can be used to change the look of the page.
On the sample data site, there is a Newsfeed link, of type Component. It displays a 
list of the categories; you click them to see the list of sites in the category, and you 
click one of the sites to see its News feed. This is an example of how there can be 
pages on your site that do not have menu items pointing to them, and yet they are 
still accessible. There is only one menu item pointing to the Newsfeed component on 
that site, and yet it is possible to see any of the news feeds by following links in 
the component.
Planning the Zak Springs Menu Structure
We've leapt ahead and added a menu item for the Zak Springs site without too much 
discussion of the menu structure we'd like to end up with, so we'd better catch up!
We'd like to have three menus, a top (horizontal) menu, a main navigation menu, 
and a menu at the bottom of the page.
From our requirements in Chapter 1, we'll make a quick list of the kind of menu 
items we'd like our menus to have. However, this is just a rough sketch at this point, 
since we don't yet have a clear view on how we'll create the pages for most of the 
menu items. Also, since Mambo doesn't allow you to edit the type of a menu item 
after you've created it, we can't even rush off and create the menu structure and then 
add the types of content later. For now, we will have to content ourselves with 
this plan.
Top Menu: This menu will provide quick links to the main parts of the site:
Home    News    Courses    Pro-Shop    Members
Main Menu: This is our main navigational element. The indented elements below 
would be nested menu items:

We'll create the Bottom Menu now. The other menus we will create as we go, in 
later chapters.
Creating the Bottom Menu
From Menu | Menu Manager, click the New button to create a new menu. We'll 
give this menu the Name bottommenu, and the module corresponding to this menu 
will be called Bottom Menu:

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
Click the Save button and our menu is created:
To get on with adding the menu items to this menu, click the graphic in the Menu 
Items column of the bottommenu row:

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 128 ]
Now click the New button in the toolbar, and we can add our first menu item, 
Home, which will point to the homepage of the site. This menu item will be of 
type Component, because it will point to the homepage of a component — the 
FrontPage component.
Check the Component radio button, and click the Next button in the toolbar:
Enter Home into the Name field and select the FrontPage component from the 
Component list. Everything else can be left as it is if for now.
Click the Save button in the toolbar, and our bottom menu is underway:

Chapter 6
[ 129 ]
There isn't much else to add to this menu at the moment, other than the 
Accommodation link, pointing to the Web Links component as earlier, so add that, 
and let's move on to see how to display the menu on the page.
Assigning the Menu to a Module Position
The display of a menu is determined by the module that corresponds to it. Right 
now, the module corresponding to our bottommenu menu has not been published, 
so we can't see it anyway. If you go to Modules | Site Modules, you will also see 
that its default position is left, which is not where we want the menu displayed. We 
want the module displayed somewhere near the bottom of the page, ideally in 
the middle.
Click the Bottom Menu link, and we can see about a better position for this module. 
If you have a look on the Position drop-down list, there is a position called footer 
that sounds pretty hopeful:

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 130 ]
Select footer from the Position dropdown, select Yes for the Published option. 
We want this to be a horizontal menu, so let's scroll down the screen, and select 
Horizontal from the Menu Style:
Click the Save button in the toolbar.
As we created this menu, there were two things to notice:
The menu is just a holder of menu items, links to "pages".
How the menu is displayed is controlled by the corresponding module.
Thus if you find yourself puzzling over why a menu looks the way it does, then you 
need to look into the module corresponding to the menu rather than the menu itself.
Returning to our bottom menu, if you preview your site, you won't see your menu. 
The problem is that the current template does not support the footer position.
If you use Site | Preview | Inline with Positions to see the modules positions 
supported by the current template, you don't see footer! This is rather unfortunate at 
the moment, but not a big problem, and we'll overcome it in Chapter 11, and reveal 
our Bottom Menu in all its glory.
If you are desperate to see your new menu, you could change its position to banner, 
which is where advertising banners are displayed (it's at the foot of the page in the 
default themes).
The Wrong Homepage?
If you have a look at your new bottommenu, and click the Home link in it, you may 
notice something odd. It looks like the front page of the site, but you won't see the 
Login Form module; but it should be there. Why is not there? It's because the Login 
Form module is displayed on the mainmenu | Home page, and this is different from 
the bottommenu | Home page. To have the Login Form module displayed on your 
bottommenu | Home page, you will need to set this from the Pages / Items panel of 
the Login Form module:

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
This might seem like a slightly confusing aspect of Mambo; you have created menu 
links that should point to the same page, but the pages aren't the same! However, it 
does make sense; the page is "defined" by the menu item, and two menu items would 
define two different pages. It might just happen that at some point, you want those 
pages to be the same, so this means that you have to modify one of the menu items to 
make it the "same" as the other menu item, so the pages the menu items point to will 
actually be the "same".
Managing Templates
Templates control your site's look and feel. We'll take a brief look at the overall 
management of templates, before we have a deeper look at them in Chapter 11.
There are two types of templates: templates for the site (front end), and administrator 
templates, for the backend. We'll look at site templates here.
Template management begins from Site | Template Manager | Site Templates from 
the administrator drop-down menu. The currently installed templates are listed:

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 132 ]
The name of the template is shown in the Name column, and hovering your mouse 
cursor over one of the entries in that column brings up a preview of how the 
template looks:

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
The default template for the site is marked in the Default column. All of the 
templates installed by default are variations on the "Water and Stone" template, with 
different colors, or optimized for different screen sizes. To select a new template for 
your site, simply check the radio button next to the template name, and click Default 
in the toolbar, and your entire site will be transformed.
Installing a new template is done through the Universal Installer that we covered in 
the previous chapter when looking at installing Mambo add-ons.
Assigning Templates to Pages
Setting a template as the default means every page on the site will use this template. 
However, you can specify a different template to be displayed on a particular page, 
so that your site can have different templates on different parts of the site, so not 
every page need look the same.
You assign a template to a particular page by checking the radio button next to the 
template name, and then clicking Assign in the toolbar. A list of the pages on the 
site, or more accurately, a list of menu items, is displayed.
To assign a template to a particular page (or a set of pages), simply select the pages 
you want in the Page(s) box, and click the Save button. On the face of it, this looks 
like it only allows you to assign templates to a small number of pages, namely the 
ones that correspond to menu items. However, when we look at managing content in 
Mambo, we'll see that it is more flexible.

Managing Menus and Templates
[ 134 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we looked at managing menus and templates. ���������������
Without menus, 
visitors will have a very difficult time finding anything on your site. ���������������
A menu is made 
up of menu items. Menu items point to pages on your site. However, they don't just 
point to a page, they define how the target page should be displayed. This control 
over the display is determined by the type of the menu item.
We saw the two stages of creating a menu item:
1.	 Choosing the type of the menu item
2.	 Providing a name for the menu item, and then some configuration specific to 
the type of menu item
We saw how the type of menu item affects not only the way the page is displayed, 
but also the options that are available to control that display.
We also saw the difference between pages and menu items. You might think you 
have two menu items pointing to the same page, but in fact the pages are slightly 
different. The page is "defined" by the menu item, and two menu items would define 
two different pages, so you may need to adjust one of the menu items to make it like 
the other page.
We finished the chapter with a look at template management. We saw how to select 
different templates, and assign templates to different pages on the site.

Managing Users
Mambo enables visitors to your site to create and maintain their own user account, 
and maintain their personal details. Those annoying little tasks like managing lost 
passwords are also taken care of for you by Mambo.
User accounts can be created in two ways:
By the user registering on your site
By the Super Administrator (that's you)
The first method involves a confirmation email sent to the user's email account. This 
email contains a link for them to click and confirm their registration to activate their 
account (although this feature can be turned off).
In this chapter, we will walk through the creation of new users, both by registering 
as a new user from the standard visitor interface on the site and by the Super 
Administrator.
We will also look at the features for managing users from the back end of the site, 
and look at the different types of back-end user that can be created, and what power 
they have.
We conclude the chapter by exploring the users and roles we will need to set up for 
the Zak Springs site.
User Groups
Not all users of a Mambo site are equal; different users can have different 
"permissions". Some can just read the text on the web pages, click links, and 
generally just "see" things and interact in a limited way. Some users are able to "do" 
things, and actually able to change things.
•
•

Managing Users
[ 136 ]
Rather than managing these permissions at the level of individual users, Mambo has 
groups of users, and certain permissions are assigned to these groups. When a user is 
a member of a group, they get the permissions of that group.
Groups in Mambo are divided in two types, front-end groups and back-end groups, 
and this determines where they can do their stuff.
The front-end groups are Registered, Author, Editor, and Publisher. The 
Registered user is a standard site user, with a username and password. 
There isn't much else they can do, other than enjoy reading the content of the 
site. The Author, Editor, and Publisher groups deal with the submission of 
content through the front end of the site. We'll talk more about these in the 
next few chapters when we start managing content.
The back-end groups are Manager, Administrator, and Super 
Administrator. We'll meet these later in this chapter.
The Special Ones
We have seen in the last few chapters that for published items on our site, we can 
restrict access to one of three sets of users: Public, Registered, and Special. We 
explained who users in the Public and Registered set were, but we were not so 
forthcoming about this Special set. This consists of users who are an Author, Editor, 
or Publisher.
Ingredients of a User
Every user, front end or back end, requires a certain amount of information to 
uniquely identify them in Mambo. There are three things required of every user 
in Mambo:
A username: This identifies who the user is, and is their online identity 
in Mambo.
A password: This is required to verify that the user is who they claim to be.
A valid email address: A confirmation email is sent to this address.
Once the user account is created for a user, the user is of course able to modify 
their details.
Registering as a User 
The first thing we'll do is to create a user account by registering on the front end of 
the site as a normal visitor would. We'll call the user account testuser.

[ 137 ]
Before doing this, make sure you have configured your mail setup properly from 
the Mail tab of the Global Configuration settings. You will need this because 
a confirmation email will be sent to the email address you specify for the user. 
The confirmation email sent by Mambo is a key part of the registration process, 
and includes a special link for the visitor to click to activate their account. If you 
can't get your mail setup working, you can follow the text and screenshots for 
now. Configuring mail from a desktop, test environment is not always so easy. 
Don't worry though, when your site is live on a web-hosting account, you will 
undoubtedly be able to access a mail server.
1.	 First of all, make sure you are on the site's homepage, so that you can see the 
Login module. Click the Create one link after the No account yet? text at 
the foot of the Login module. If for some reason, you can't see the Login 
module (you should be able to!), then you can use the direct URL of the 
registration page:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_registration&t
ask=register
This brings you to the Registration page:
2.	 Enter the Name as Test User, and testuser for the Username.
3.	 Enter your own email address into the E-mail field.
4.	 For convenience, we are going to use testuser for the password as well as the 
username. If you can think of a better password at this point, enter it instead. 
Enter the password again into the Verify password field.

Managing Users
[ 138 ]
The password needs to be more than 6 letters, and should 
contain only alphanumeric characters and no spaces. If 
your password does not conform, a dialog box will pop 
up advising you of this, and you will not be able to submit 
your details until you have chosen a suitable password.
5.	 Check the box next to Yes, I Accept to accept the Disclaimer and Privacy 
Policy. If you don't check the box to accept these terms, you will not be able 
to register.
6.	 Click the Send Registration button. You will see a screen asking you to 
confirm your details. You can click the CORRECT YOUR DATA button to 
go back and change the details, or click CONFIRM REGISTRATION to 
move on:
7.	 Once you click CONFIRM REGISTRATION, you will see a message like 
this:
Registration Complete
Your account has been created and an activation link has been sent to the 
e-mail address you entered.
Note that you must activate the account by clicking on the activation link 
before you can login.
8.	 Open up your email client, and log in to check your mail. You should find a 
mail with the subject New User Account Activation waiting for you. It will 
be from the email address you specified in the Administrator Email field in 
the Site Configuration Menu. The body of that email will look something 
like this:

Chapter 7
[ 139 ]
Hello Test User,
Thank you for registering at Test Site. Your account has been created but, 
as a precaution, it must be activated by you before you can use it.
To activate the account click on the following link or copy and paste it in 
your browser:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_registration&
task=activate&activation=b157f6e453fba6cbe91ae337ace64d57
After activation you may login to http://localhost/mambo46 using the 
following username and password:
Username – testuser
Password – testuser
9.	 Click the link in the email, or copy the link and paste it into your browser, and 
you will be taken to the activation page on your Mambo site where you will 
see a message of the form:
Activation Complete!
Your account has been activated successfully. You can now login using the 
username and password you chose during registration.
10.	 You are now ready to start using the username and password to log in. Note 
that you will have to return to the front page of your site to use the login 
module to log into the site.
That's all there is to creating a new user account. You will have done it hundreds 
of times on different sites across the Internet, and Mambo's user registration is 
no different.
Note that only one occurrence of a particular username is allowed; the system will 
check the uniqueness of the username before creating the account.
Also, the Disclaimer and Privacy Policy is currently "hard-coded" into the page 
output; at present, it is not configurable. If you're interested, the text to modify to 
add your own disclaimer can be found in the file registration.html.php in the 
folder components\com_registration, on line 139:
<?php echo T_('put your disclaimer here..'); ?>
In the mail sent to the visitor, you will notice that the link to activate the account 
contains the URL of your Mambo site:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_registration&
task=activate&activation=b157f6e453fba6cbe91ae337ace64d57

Managing Users
[ 140 ]
Note that the URL of the site is taken straight from your 
Mambo setup, so the activation link is certain to point to 
the right site!
The activation part of the URL is what identifies the unregistered visitor to the 
system. When the visitor registers their details, Mambo stores them in the database 
along with the activation value. When the visitor visits the above link, Mambo will 
check the value of activation against the values stored in the database, and if it finds 
a match, that user account will be activated.
This is the last time a user will be able to see the password they entered. Mambo 
sends the password now, before it is stored in the database. The password itself isn't 
stored in the database, but a one-way encoded form is. This means that the original 
password cannot be retrieved. Except possibly by some super-sophisticated hacker 
like you see in movies, or some secret government agency, also like the kind you see 
in movies.
Should a user forget their password, a new one can be sent to them. They can 
click the Password Reminder link on the Login Form module (or enter the URL 
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_registration&task=
lostPassword on your site), and then enter their username and E-mail address to 
receive a mail with a new, automatically-generated password. The visitor can now 
log in with this password, and change it to whatever they like (hopefully something 
they won't forget this time).
Note that unlike some other systems, the activation link does not expire.
Front-End User Goodies
Now that you have created (and activated!) a front-end account on your site, you 
could log in to see what goodies await you. If you return to the front page of your 
site, enter the Username and Password into the Login Form module, and click 
LOGIN, you should be logged in.
If you can't see the Login module, enter this URL instead:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_login
This will take you to page with a form for entering your Username and Password 
details, and a LOGIN button to log in. The Login Form module bypasses this page, 
and goes straight to the authentication of your account details.

Chapter 7
[ 141 ]
To be honest, there isn't much to see on the blank site!
Go ahead and create the testuser account on our previous sample data installation. 
After you're done there, and you log in, the User module is much more appealing:
Your name is now displayed in the Login Form module, and the User Menu 
module has appeared, including some links to your details, and to submit some 
pieces of content (a FAQ or a WebLink). You are able to edit all your details from 
the Your Details link (which takes you to the page index.php?option=com_
user&task=UserDetails), including changing your username.
User Management
Let's move on to user management at the back end of the site. User management 
starts by selecting the Site | User Manager option on the Administrator menu bar, 
or clicking the Users icon in the Control Panel:

Managing Users
[ 142 ]
This brings up the User Manager. The list of currently registered users is displayed.
There is a text box to enter some text to Filter the usernames by—this allows you to 
search for users whose name matches your text.
The two drop-down boxes allow you to select users who are in a particular group, or 
show the users that are currently logged in, or not logged in.
For each user, the Logged In column is ticked if the user is currently logged in. The 
Enabled column indicates if the user account is activated. The UserID column shows 
their username, and their Group, E-mail address, and the time of their Last Visit is 
also shown.
Right now, we have only two users. One is your Administrator account, the other is 
the testuser account we just created. Since you activated the testuser account, there is 
a tick in its Enabled column.
While a user is in the limbo between registration and activation, their status would 
look like this in the User Manager:
The red X in the Enabled column indicates that this user account isn't activated. 
By clicking this icon, you can activate an account, or deactivate an account that is 
currently operational. Deactivating an account will allow the user to continue to 
operate on the site, but once they are logged out, they will not be able to log back 
in again. Activating an account before a user activates it themselves will not cause 
problems for the user.

Chapter 7
[ 143 ]
You can log out a particular user by checking the box next to their name, and clicking 
the Force Logout icon in the toolbar. The user will then find they are logged out (as 
soon as they attempt to access another page on the server).
If you have taken a sudden dislike to a particular user, check the box next to their 
entry in the User Manager and click the Delete icon on the toolbar, and they are 
gone forever (the user account, not the person).
You can't delete a Super Administrator account. This not 
only applies to your Super Administrator account, but any 
other Super Administrator account.
User Details
Clicking on a user's name in the User Manager brings up their details:

Managing Users
[ 144 ]
The user's Name and Username, Email address, and Group can be clearly seen, 
along with some information about when they registered on the site, and the date of 
their last visit.
The group to which this user belongs is shown highlighted in the Group text box. To 
select a group, simply click on the desired one and it will be highlighted. Note that 
Public Frontend and Public Backend are not actually groups you can select; they are 
simply bits of text to identify what the groups beneath them apply to.
You can't see their password (since Mambo doesn't store the actual password in the 
database; it stores a one-way encoded version of the password), but that doesn't 
matter; if you want to change the password, simply enter the new password into 
New Password and Verify Password text boxes.
If you want to make changes to these details, you will either need to enter the same 
text into the two password fields or leave both blank. If there is text in either of 
the password text boxes, the text will need to match or else you will not be able to 
submit your changes. If you find text has been entered into the text boxes (this may 
be done automatically by your browser), then you can simply delete that text from 
the box and save your changes. The password will not be changed.
If you want to make changes to a user's details, you do so in the usual way by 
clicking either the Save or Apply button in the toolbar, or Cancel if you want to 
abandon the edits and return to the User Manager.
Login Module Configuration
When a user logs in, their username is displayed in the Login Form module. This 
feature can be changed from the Parameters for the Login Form module. From 
Modules | Site Modules, select the Login Form module, and scroll down to see its 
Parameters. Here, we are changing the message to display the user's Name, rather 
than their Username.

Chapter 7
[ 145 ]
Adding a Logout Link
Once you a user has registered on your site and logged in, the User Menu will be 
displayed to them (it's for Registered Users). However, by default, there is nothing in 
that menu. A Logout link would be helpful, since there is no other obvious way for 
the user to log out (unless that is your plan: to trap users logged in forever!).
We'll add a Logout link to the User Menu now. 
From Menu | usermenu, click New in the toolbar to create a new menu item, and 
click on the radio button beside Component from the Components panel:
Click the Next button in the toolbar (or you can simply click on Component).
Enter Logout into the Name field, and select Login from the Component list. Set the 
Level to Registered:

Managing Users
[ 146 ]
Now click the Save button in the toolbar. You will notice that apart from the Name 
we gave this menu item, there was nothing to suggest it actually will log the user 
out. The Logout link will not log the user out straight away; it will display a page 
with a button for them to click to log out. The direct URL to log out is:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=logout
You can control some aspects of the page that displays the logout button by editing 
the menu item, and making use of the Parameters (scroll down to find them):
These options allow you to specify things like the page to redirect the user to after 
they have logged out (the default is the homepage of the site).
Super Administrator Details
If you look at the details of a Super Administrator account, you will see some minor 
differences between their details and "ordinary" users:
First of all, the Group cannot be changed. A Super Administrator cannot become 
anything other than a Super Administrator.
The next thing to note is the Receive Submission Emails option. When set to Yes, 
this account will receive notifications (as we'll see later, actually private messages) 

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
when certain content items are submitted to the site. We'll see this in action in the 
coming chapters.
Creating New Users at the Back end
The Super Administrator is able to create new users from the User Manager area. 
Click the New button in the toolbar to bring up the User: Add screen, which is 
almost identical to the User: Edit screen:
You enter the user's details here (remember the passwords need to match), select 
their group, and click Save or Apply to store the user.
When you create a user in this way, you (the Super Administrator) will not receive 
an email informing that a new user has been created (well, you did just do it 
yourself...). However, an email will be sent to the email address you specified for this 
account, informing the person that an account has been created:

Managing Users
[ 148 ]
You have been added as a user to Zak Springs Golf Club by an 
Administrator.
This email contains your username and password to log into the 
http://localhost/zaksprings
Username - testuser
Password - testuser
Please do not respond to this message as it is automatically generated and 
is for information purposes only
Unless you specify Yes for the Block User option (its default is No), this user 
account will be enabled as soon as you click Save or Apply. Selecting Yes for the 
Block User option will mean the account isn't activated, but an email will be sent to 
the user anyway.
The Registration Process
We went through the registration process as a normal visitor, but we didn't really 
talk about the Super Administrator's role in this.
Whenever a user attempts to register on the site (before the account is activated), an 
email notification, with a title like Account details for <Username> at <Name of 
your site> is sent to the Super Administrator.
Hello The Administrator,
A new user has registered at Zak Springs.
This email contains their details:
Name - Test User
e-mail – theiremailaddress@theirsite.com
Username - testuser
Please do not respond to this message as it is automatically generated and 
is for information purposes only
Registration Options
The administrator can control aspects of the user registration process from options 
on the Site tab of the Global Configuration control panel:

Chapter 7
[ 149 ]
The first option, Allow User Registration, actually allows the above procedure to be 
carried out. If this option is set to No, then new users cannot register on the site, and 
only the administrator can create users. The default value is Yes.
The account activation stage can be bypassed by setting Use New Account 
Activation to No. If it is set in this way, then no email to activate the account will be 
sent, and the user account will be activated as soon as the details are entered. The 
administrator will still receive the email confirming the registration of a new user. 
The default value for this option is Yes.
By default, only one occurrence of an email address is allowed on the system; if 
someone uses an email address that belongs to another user account, then that 
address will be rejected, and the user will have to choose another address. This can 
be turned off by setting the Require Unique Email option to No, and future visitors 
will be able to register even if their email address is already in the database. The 
default value for this option is Yes.
Even an administrator is unable to assign the same email address to two different 
user accounts if the Require Unique Email address is set to Yes.
Managing Other Administrators
The Super Administrator account that you have been working with has complete 
control over the entire site. Super Administrator is actually a group, and your 
account is a member of that group.
As your site grows, it is possible that you may wish to get other people to help you 
out with some limited administration of the site, or you may even want to have 
different administrators for different tasks from the outset. Mambo lets you do this.
In addition to the Super Administrator group, Mambo provides two other types 
of groups with control over certain parts of the site back end. These are the 
manager and administrator groups. The manager group is concerned with content 
management; the administrator group is concerned with site administration.
A user in either of these groups is able to access the administration area of your 
site with these accounts. Obviously, no one can create an account like this for 
themselves; the account would have to be created by a Super Administrator, or an 
Administrator user.

Managing Users
[ 150 ]
A back-end user account is also valid on the front end of the site. Once you log in to 
the front end of the site with a back-end account, you will find that your front-end 
account has the same privileges as a Publisher. Exactly what a Publisher does will be 
seen in the next chapter.
Note that if you are logged into the front end of the site with a back-end user 
account, you will still have to log in from the administrator login page before you 
can do work on the back end.
The Administrator
Back-end users in the Administrator group have pretty comprehensive power, 
including administrative control over users, modules, and content among other 
things. However, they cannot manage the site templates, nor can they change the 
Global Configuration.
An administrator can create new users, and edit user details, including assigning 
users to different groups. An administrator cannot create a Super Administrator 
account, nor can they assign another user to Super Administrator status, nor can 
they even see the identity of the Super Administrators. In other words, they can only 
manage users who are "less than or equal to them".
Administrator accounts are "equal", which means you can't delete another 
administrator, but you can modify their details. You can change the password of 
another Administrator.
Users in the Administrator group have the Receive Submission Emails option 
available in their user details, so they can receive notifications about content 
submissions. Actually, they will receive private messages when a content item is 
submitted, as we'll see in the next chapter.
The Manager
Back-end users in the Manager group are able to manage content. Their 
administration toolbar is limited to only a couple of options, and the control panel 
shows only options for working with content:

Chapter 7
[ 151 ]
A manager's attempts to access any other parts of the administration area will fail. In 
particular, a manager cannot administer users or modules; nor can create other front-
end users.
Users in the Manager group do not have the Receive 
Submission Emails option available in their user details.
Summary of Permissions for Back-end

Zak Springs Users and Groups
We'll continue with the Zak Springs site, and create some users in various groups 
that correspond to the requirements of the site. When you create these users, you 
may want to add your own email address for the users, and, for convenience, before 
you start, you may want to set the Require Unique Email address option to No in 
the Global Configuration to allow to you to use the same email address for them all.
Here is the statement of the permissions and privileges mentioned in the original site 
requirements:
"Weblog" for Club Professionals, offering equipment and game tips
"Weblog" for Club President
Administrative Staff to be able to publish and amend news items
Hospitality staff to be able to publish and amend content for 
hospitality facilities
Marketing Manager to be able to amend any content on the site
Nominated member of Administrative Staff to have full control over site
Ability to amend these permissions in future
Club President to have full control over site
From this, it looks like we'd want to set up a Super Administrator account for the 
Club President (well, he is paying our bill...), and also a Super Administrator or 
Administrator account for one of the members of the Administrative Staff, 
Edgar Hooch.

Chapter 7
[ 153 ]
From the looks of it, the Administrative Staff would probably want to be set up with 
a Publisher account on the front end.
The Marketing Manager only needs to amend, so Editor seems like a good choice for 
him. However, it may be best to give this user a Manager account, to manage content 
on the back end. This would put him in total control of the site's content.
However, further discussion reveals that the Marketing Manager should check all 
the content before it goes onto the site. This would certainly mean the Marketing 
Manager would need a Manager back-end account.
We'll create these accounts:
Name
User name

Otto Simplex

Super Administrator
Edgar Hooch
edgarh

Brad Visionary

Manager
Marie Flame
marief

Audrey Pores
audreyp

Neil Vortex

Frontend – Publisher
There are more accounts to create, but these will do for now. You may prefer, for 
the sake of your convenience, to give these accounts more memorable names, such 
as admini for the administrator, manager for the Manager, editor for the Front-end 
Editor, author, publisher and so on.
Set up these accounts, and your list of users should look as follows:

We'll also set the Administrator account (Edgar Hooch) to receive  Submission Emails.
Summary
In this chapter we have seen how users are able to register themselves on your site, 
and how you as the Super Administrator manage them from the back end of the site.
We walked through creating a new user account on the site, and saw the mail 
received by new users with their account details, and also the other administrator 
mails that are triggered when new users register themselves on the site.
We also saw how to create a back-end user, a user in the Administrator or Manager 
group. Each of these groups has limitations on the back-end tasks that they can do; 
an Administrator "manages" the site, a Manager "manages" content.
We also looked briefly at the so-called Special front-end users, users in one of the 
Author, Editor, or Publisher groups. We'll see more of these as we move into content 
management in the coming chapters.
Finally, we ended the chapter by creating a number of user accounts for key 
personnel on the Zak Springs site.

Managing Content
So far our site is pretty empty. The middle bit of our homepage still seems pretty 
empty. It feels like there is something missing. That's right, the content.
Mambo does not summon content from the darkest regions of the universe to appear 
on your site by magic (I'm sorry to disappoint you there). In this chapter, we will 
begin the journey of managing content with Mambo, or, in other words, getting stuff 
up on the site.
Here we're going to look at the fundamental type of Mambo content, the content 
item. Content items are the most versatile type of Mambo's content, and have 
probably the richest set of features of all its available content types. In fact, there are 
so many features and options that it can make you dizzy. That is what this chapter 
is for. No — not making you dizzy, but helping you avoid the dizziness by guiding 
you through all the features of Mambo content management.
In this chapter, we will look at the back-end details of content item management. We 
will cover:
Organizing content items into sections and categories
Managing sections and categories
Adding, deleting, and archiving content
Adding content items to menus
Adding images to content with the mosimage mambot
Different views of content
In the following chapter, we will look at content item management from the front 
end of the site.

Managing Content
[ 156 ]
Organizing Content
Mambo has two schemes for entering content in the Content component: organized 
content and static content. Static content is content that is "not organized"; that 
doesn't necessarily means it's disorganized. It simply means that the content items 
in this scheme are not intended to fit into any particular organization of hierarchy; 
they are a kind of floating content if you like. This kind of content would be used for 
one-off pieces of content that don't particularly relate to or fit with anything else on 
the site directly.
We'll actually spend most of our time talking about "organized content", since this is 
the way that you will mostly be storing your content in Mambo.
Before you start entering content, you need some form of organization for it. Mambo 
organizes content into sections and categories, following this hierarchy:
This diagram shows that sections contain categories, and categories contain the 
content items. Sections do not contain content items directly.
What is also implied from this diagram is that a content item can belong to at most 
one category, and a category belongs to at most one section. Categories cannot 
contain other categories.
A way of thinking about sections and categories that you will often see is that 
sections are like the drawers in a filing cabinet, categories are the folders within those 
drawers, and the content items are the documents within the folders.

Chapter 8
[ 157 ]
Why Organize Content?
Organizing content makes it easier for the visitor to find something; if they 
were looking for an article about Tyrannosaurus Rex, and they saw you had a 
collection of articles about dinosaurs, they would probably expect to find the article 
in that collection.
Organizing content also makes it easier to decide where content should go, and it 
also has benefits in terms of how you manage the display of the content, and help the 
visitor navigate through the structure.
For example, you can display a list of all the content items in a category, which 
will be automatically updated as soon as you change the details of a content item, 
delete it, unpublish it, and so on. Similarly, lists of all the categories within a 
particular section are also generated by Mambo, so that you can very easily create a 
navigational structure for your content.
You can create a menu entry that will display a list of all the categories in a particular 
section. The exact display of this list can be controlled from the administration area 
of course. When a user clicks on one of the categories, all the content items in that 
category will be displayed; again, the display of this list can be controlled from the 
administration area. In this way, you will have created a navigational structure for 
everything in a particular section simply by adding a single menu entry. That's it; 
and when you update your content items, your lists get updated automatically. We'll 
see more about this later in the chapter.
Planning the Zak Springs Content Structure 
While this all seems straightforward, it is not entirely clear how this organization 
will relate to the kind of content you plan to add to your site. So let's see how we 
would organize the planned content for Zak Springs into sections and categories.
Let's review the requirements from Chapter 1 that look as if they might relate to 
content items:
Categorized news publishing; course news, membership information, 
competition results
Weblog for Club Professionals, offering equipment and game tips
Weblog for Club President
Content for hospitality facilities
Information about the club and its history
The first requirement suggests that we would want a News section, with categories 
like Course Information, Membership, and Tournaments.
•

Managing Content
[ 158 ]
The Club President's Weblog is a collection of articles written by the club president, 
he wants to write about his vision for the future of the club, the course and so on. It 
sounds like we'd want a section devoted to the president, say From the President.
The Club Professional will also need a Weblog, so we can have a From the 
Professional section. That section would have categories like Equipment, Game Tips, 
Special Offers (advising of the latest offers available in his shop).
A Hospitality or Facilities section seems to fit the bill as well. This would contain 
categories like Restaurant, Bar, Weddings, among others.
Finally, the "Information about the club and its history" requirement is quite 
interesting. This suggests a section like About Zak Springs, but since content items 
can't belong to sections directly, we would need some categories there. We could 
have a category called History, and a category called General Information.
However, these categories for About Zak Springs seem like adding an unnecessary 
number of categories—the only reason we want to add them is because the system 
forces to add them because we can't attach content items directly to sections. Also, 
the club's history does not change that much from week to week, even with the Club 
President's highly revisionist view of his own achievements and importance to the 
club, so the benefits of the automatic list of content items wouldn't really be felt here. 
All of this suggests that the standard section-category model of content organization 
isn't really what we want here. We will look into using the other way of managing 
content, static content, for this.
In this chapter we will create a number of these sections and categories as we go, and 
also add a couple of content items to the categories to get the site warmed up.
Creating Sections
The first step on the road to creating content is to create your sections. Section 
management can be started from one of two places:
Clicking the Sections icon in the control panel of the administration 
homepage:
Selecting the Content | Section Manager menu option of the 
administrator menu
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 159 ]
Both of these will bring you to the Section Manager page.
Since we currently have no sections, there isn't much to see on this page, so let's get 
cracking with creating a new section.
Click the New icon in the toolbar on the Section Manager page.
All a section needs is a Title and a Section Name. The Title of the section is how the 
section will be displayed on the front end of the site. The Section Name is how the 
section will be identified in the back end of the site.
Go ahead and create the sections for the Zak Spring site. After entering the title and 
section name, click the Save icon in the toolbar, and then click the New icon from the 
Section Manager toolbar to create the next section.
Zak Springs Sections
For the Zak Springs site, we will add these sections. We will give each section the 
same title and section name:
Club News
From the President
The From The President section is for the president's blog.
Section Manager Page
Now that we have some sections, the Section Manager screen looks a bit more 
interesting:
•
•

Managing Content
[ 160 ]
This kind of table is probably becoming very familiar to you now. We see the Section 
Name (the title of the section is in brackets), whether the section is published, its 
order, who can access it; and also:
# Categories: the number of categories contained within that section
# Active: the total number of content items which are not "trashed" in the 
categories within that section
# Trash: the number of things "trashed" from that section
I've used the word "things" to describe what the Trash column represents. Things 
actually means categories here. When we delete a category in a section, it doesn't 
actually get deleted straight away, but instead goes into the trash (like the Recycle 
Bin on your computer), from where it can get removed from the system entirely. The 
number of categories sitting in the trash that belong to that section is shown in the 
Trash column. 
You can publish, unpublish, and edit the details of sections in the usual way from the 
Section Manager. We'll return to other operations with sections later in the chapter.
Creating Categories
Now that we have some sections, we can add some categories, and assign these to 
some of our sections.
General category management can be started from one of two places:
By clicking the Categories link in the control panel of the administration 
home page:
From the Content | Category Manager menu option of the administrator 
menu
There is a third way to manage categories, and this takes you straight to the 
categories within a particular section. When you select the Content | Content By 
Section menu option of the administrator menu, each section is listed as a menu 
option. Each of these sections in turn expands to provide a link to the all the content 
items under that section, as well as a link to Add/Edit the categories in that section:
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 161 ]
All of these options bring you to the Category Manager. Choosing the category from 
the Content | Content By Section menu option will show only the categories within 
your chosen section.
Initially, the Category Manager display is empty, so let's press straight on with 
creating categories.
Before we get into the mechanics of creating a category, it's worth bearing this fact 
in mind. Remember we said that categories are assigned to exactly one section? You 
would be correct in thinking that you assign the section at the time you create the 
category. What may be more surprising is this:
Once a category is created and assigned to a section, that assignment 
cannot be changed. The only way to reassign a category to a new 
section is to move the category, which we'll cover later in the chapter.
To begin creating a category, click the New icon in the toolbar of the Category 
Manager, and you will find yourself at the Category:New page.
The Category Details panel is similar to the Section Details panel we saw earlier. 
An important field is the Section field. You select the section you want to assign this 
category to from the list of sections in the drop-down box. If you discover that the 
section you want hasn't been created yet, it will be easiest to ���������������������
cancel ���������������
 creating your 
category, and instead create the section first and then return to creating the category. 
You must specify a section; if you do not, you will be not be able to 
create the category.

Managing Content
[ 162 ]
If you chose to do your category management through the Content | Content By 
Section administrator menu option, the section will already be chosen for you.
Zak Springs Categories
For the Zak Springs site, we will add these categories, and assign them to the 
following sections:
Membership (Membership), assigned to Club News 
Tournaments (Tournaments) , assigned to Club News
Course Information (Course Information), assigned to Club News 
The Future (The Future), assigned to From the President
The Course (The Course), assigned to From the President
Fun and Trivia (Fun and Trivia), assigned to From the President
Category Manager Page
Now that we have some categories, the Category Manager page is a bit more lively:
Once again, it's a familiar table. You can see if a category has been published, its 
order, which group of users can view the category and also how many published 
content items belong to that category, and how many content items from that 
category are waiting in the trash.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 163 ]
The section to which the category belongs is also displayed. Clicking on the name 
of the section takes you to the Section Edit page, from where you can edit details of 
that section. Note that after finishing your edits on the section, you will find yourself 
in the Section Manager rather than the Category Manager.
You can use the drop-down box to restrict the categories to only those from a 
particular section. We'll return to the other operations you can perform with 
categories later in the chapter.
Entering Content
Perhaps this section should really be called "Finally we get to type stuff into the 
system". Now that we've done sections and categories, we're ready for what you 
have been waiting for—entering content into the system. Actually, typing in the 
content isn't the interesting bit of this section, we've already seen the basics of 
entering content in Chapter 3, along with a look at the HTML editor.
What is interesting here is the set of options Mambo provides for:
Adding images to the content item
Adding the content item to an existing menu
Entering information about the content item to help it get indexed by 
search engines
Controlling when the item is published to the site
Controlling the elements that are displayed along with the content item
These options move Mambo beyond a simple system where you just enter some 
text that gets displayed on a web page, and make it an extremely flexible content 
management system.
Content Items Manager Page
The Content Items Manager page is the your place for adding or editing content items.
It can be reached by:
Clicking the All Content Items icon in the control panel of the administrator 
home page:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Managing Content
[ 164 ]
Selecting the Content | All Content Items menu option of the administrator 
menu.
If there already is a content item in a category belonging to a particular 
section, there will be a content items menu entry for that section under ����
the 
Content | Content By Section menu option of the administrator menu.
Any of these will bring you to the Content Items Manager page. The third option 
will restrict you to content items in the categories belonging to the chosen section.
Initially, the Content Items Manager page is empty, so we will postpone our 
discussion of it for a moment.
Creating a New Content Item
Creating a new content item begins with clicking the New icon in the toolbar of the 
Content Items Manager page.
This brings you to the Content Item New page:
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 165 ]
Here you can see the HTML editor for the Intro Text field, and some text boxes for 
the Title and Title Alias fields. The Title of the content item is, well, the title of the 
content item. It is used to identify the story, and also in the <title> element of the 
HTML for the page, which appears in the title bar of your browser.
The Intro Text is the introduction to your piece of content. Usually, this is a "teaser", 
encouraging the reader to read the rest of the content. The "rest of it" is contained in 
the Main Text field, which is underneath the Intro Text field (and not shown in the 
image on the previous page).
There are drop-down boxes for you to choose the Section and Category to which this 
content item will belong. When you select a section from the Section dropdown, the 
Category dropdown will update to show the categories from that section. You must 
select a section and a category from these boxes before the content item can be saved.
The image opposite is not exactly what you will see when you click the New icon on 
the toolbar; we have cheated a bit for the sake of making the image simpler. Instead 
of the Show Advanced Details link that you can see in the image, you will see a 
tabbed panel on the right-hand side of the screen, with a link above it saying Hide 
Advanced Details. That link was clicked before the screenshot was taken to avoid 
overcomplicating the initial discussion. We will come to these "advanced details" 
in a moment.
First of all let's press on with entering some content. We'll add a content item that 
will go into the Course Information category of the Club News section. Select these 
from the relevant drop-down boxes, and in ����
the Title field, enter Back Nine Closed 
for one week.
In the Intro Text field, enter:
The last nine holes will be closed for one week due to an 
incident involving a large fanged beast attacking golfers.
The holes will be off limits for a week, while 
the Military attempt to apprehend the beast.
In the Main Text field enter:
All golfers are advised to return briskly from the ninth
green to the clubhouse, and certainly not to venture out 
onto the back nine after dark.
Click the Apply button in the toolbar and our first content item is saved, and we can 
continue. We've seen the Save, Apply, and Close toolbar buttons a number of times 
over the last few chapters, so there isn't much to say about them now.

Managing Content
[ 166 ]
The tabbed panel on the right-hand side of the Content Item New page holds a 
number of options for the content item. You can hide this panel by clicking the Hide 
Advanced Details link, and reveal it by clicking Show Advanced Details. We'll 
cover the options available on this panel now.
Adding the Item to a Menu
The Link to Menu tab allows you to add your content item as a top-level menu item 
to one of the existing menus. You select the menu you want to add the item to from 
the Select a Menu list, enter the name of the menu item, then click the Link to 
Menu button:
The menu item will only be added after you click the Link 
to Menu button; saving the content item will not add the 
menu item unless you have done this.
Once you click the button, the list of Existing Menu Links is updated:

Chapter 8
[ 167 ]
If you want to add a content item to the top level of a menu, this tab is for you. 
Creating the menu item at this point saves you having to go the Menu Manager, 
specify the type of the menu item, select the content item, and so on. However, you 
can only add a top-level menu item from this tab; you can't create a "nested" menu 
item directly from here. After you've created a menu item from here, you can edit 
it in the Menu Manager (as you would with any other menu item) and change its 
Parent item to nest it.
Having added the content item to the mainmenu, you will be able to see the content 
item if you preview your site now.
We'll look at more sophisticated ways of adding content items to menu items later.
Adding Images to the Item
In an earlier chapter we saw how to add an image into the text of the HTML editor 
using the Insert/edit image button of the editor. There is another way to add images 
into your content, and that is to use the ����������������
mosimage �������
mambot.
Before we add an image using �������������������������������������������������������
mosimage�����������������������������������������������
, save the content item, and then we'll create 
a folder using the Media Manager to store the images for our news stories. Go to the 
Media Manager page (from Site | Media Manager), create a directory called news, 
and upload the backnine_beast.png file from this chapter's code download to that 
directory. Once you've done that, get back to the content item we were working on.
We'll add the image we just uploaded into our content item. Under the HTML editor 
for the Main Text, you can see the button for adding the ����������������
mosimage ��������
 mambot:
The mosimage mambot is the I button; the other button is a mambot for adding 
pagebreaks. Click the mosimage mambot button, and the word {mosimage} will be 
added to your Main Text.
Now we have to associate an image to go with this occurrence of the mambot. 
Mambots are a sort of filter, that run when Mambo wants something particular 
done, like displaying a piece of content or searching. The mosimage mambot works 
by replacing each occurrence of the string {mosimage} in a piece of content with an 
associated image, adding some further formatting and possibly a caption. We associate 
images to the mosimage occurrences using the Images tab of the Advanced Details.

Managing Content
[ 168 ]
The first thing to do is to select the directory containing your image (it uses the same 
directory structure as the Media Manager). We want the image we uploaded to the 
/news/ folder, so we start by selecting this from the Sub-folder dropdown. Once you 
select the /news/ folder, the list of files in that folder will be displayed. When you 
select one of the files, a preview of the image is displayed:
Select the image you want (in this case we have only one), and click the Add button. 
The name of the image will be added to the Content Images box underneath the 
Add button:
You can add several images to this box by selecting them from the list in Gallery 
Images. The order of the images in the Content Images list determines which 
mosimage they will be associated with. The first image in the list will go with your 
first mosimage occurrence, the next image will go the next mosimage occurrence 
in your text, and so on. You can reorder the images in the box with up and down 
buttons, or you can remove an image.
We're still not done yet. Make sure you select the image you want in the Content 
Images box, because there is still more to do. When you select the image, another 
preview of the image will appear next to the box.

Chapter 8
[ 169 ]
Under the Content Images box is another set of options for controlling the 
formatting of the image, and an important button, Apply.
We've set the Image Align to Right, so it will appear on the right-hand side of our 
content, and added a caption A Model of an Eye Witness Account, and some Alt 
Text for when the image isn't displayed.
Once we're happy, we need to click the Apply button. Until you click the Apply 
button, your image will not be associated with your mosimage mambot and your 
formatting options will not be preserved. Even if you save at this point, none of this 
information will be saved. If you have not selected the desired image in the Content 
Images box, you will be prompted to do so.
Once you've clicked Apply, now it's time to click the Save icon in the toolbar to save 
your content item. The next screenshot shows how our new content item looks on 
the site; we've added a bit more text to the content item (you can find this in the code 
download for this chapter):

Managing Content
[ 170 ]
The mosimage mambot makes adding images to your articles pretty easy. Also, 
when you come back to edit the content item, and you select the image in the 
Content Images box, all of the formatting and other options you set for that image 
will also be displayed ready for editing.
Remember that the images replace the {mosimage} occurrences in the order they 
appear in the text, not the order you added them to the text. This means that any 
mosimages in the Intro Text will have their images first. You will notice that you can 
use mosimage mambots in both the Intro Text and the Main Text, and yet there is 
only one Content Images box for both bits of text, so you may want to take care if 
you are using mosimages in both of these fields.
Keywords and Description for SEO
We encountered the meta tags in Chapter 4 when looking at the Global 
Configuration, and mentioned that they might be used by search engines when 
indexing your site's pages. You can take this one step further to help improve 
the indexing of the page with your content item by specifying keywords and a 
description that reflect the "content" of the content item. Keywords are words that 
you think reflect the search terms that people could use to find your content.

Chapter 8
[ 171 ]
You add these keywords and a description in the Meta Info tab of the Advanced 
Details panel. If you can't think of any keywords, you can click the Add Sect/Cat/
Title button, and the section and category names, and the title of the content item 
will be added to the Keywords field. The keywords are entered as a list, with each 
list item separated by a comma. Thus, for our content item clicking the button gives:
Club News, Course Information, Back Nine Closed for one week
There is no need to go overboard with the number of keywords you use, and many 
search engines may regard an excessive number of keywords as spamming, and 
treat your page less favorably. Exactly what an "excessive number" means is hotly 
disputed, but you probably don't want to be using more than a dozen.
Publishing Information
The publication details of the content item are configured from the Publishing tab. 
These are the usual suspects, should the item be shown on the front page (default No)��, 
should it be published (default Yes), which group of users can see it (default Public):
You can also change the original author of the content item, and the date it was 
originally created.

Managing Content
[ 172 ]
If you do not want the item to be available immediately, you can schedule it to be 
published at a particular time from the Start Publishing box. Click the button next 
to this box, and a calendar pops up, from where you select the date when you would 
like the content item to be published. Only the date is added by the calendar, if you 
want to specify a time, you need to add this after the data in the format ���������
HH:MM:SS.
To set the item to be published at a particular time, you need to set it to published 
first. Once you do this, and set a time for it to become available, the graphic in 
the item's Published column would indicate that its published, but is "pending": 
If you want the content item to expire after a certain date, you can set this date in the 
Finish Publishing field. The default value is Never, so that an item will never expire.
Expiry will happen as soon as someone attempts to access the content item after the 
expiry date. The time of expiry is checked whenever a content item is accessed, and 
if it has passed, the item is expired and won't be displayed on the front end. Content 
items that have expired have this graphic in their Published column: 
Controlling How the Item is Displayed
When the content item is displayed to the visitor, there are a number of other 
elements that can go around it. These are controlled from the Parameters tab, and 
also from the Content tab of the Global Configuration.
These elements can be things like:
1.	 An icon to email a content item to another (potential) visitor
2.	 An icon to display a printer-friendly version of the item
3.	 An icon to display a PDF version of the item
4.	 Who created the item, and when it was created
5.	 The rating of the item
6.	 The section name or category name
7.	 Details of the last update
8.	 A Back button to help the reader navigate through your content organization
Each of these can be controlled from the Content tab of the Global Configuration. 
(We won't describe which option on that tab corresponds to which item in the list 
above, the names of the options are a giveaway, and there is always the Help 
to help...)
The diagram on the next page shows how some of these options relate to the display 
of the content item:

Chapter 8
[ 173 ]
These options on the Content tab of the Global Configuration set site-wide defaults. 
The options on the Parameters tab can be used to override these defaults. Most of the 
options on the Parameters tab have values like Use Global, Hide, and Show. The 
Use Global value, which is the default for the options on the Parameters tab, means 
that the global defaults are used.
You can experiment with these; select different values for the options, click Apply, 
then view the page with your content item to see how the values affect the display of 
the content item.
Deleting Content Items
Deleting content items requires a number of steps, since Mambo uses a trash can to 
hold deleted items before they are completely removed from the system, in a way 
similar to the Recycle Bin on your desktop.
Starting from the Content Item Manager page, the first thing you will do is to trash 
the content you want rid off.
Check the boxes next to the content items you wish to delete, then click the Trash 
icon in the toolbar:

Managing Content
[ 174 ]
You will see a message indicating you've trashed some content; there is no 
opportunity for you to confirm this action:
At this point, the item has not been deleted, it has been sent to the trash. To dispatch 
this content item completely, we have to get our hands dirty, and delve into the trash.
The Trash Manager
The Trash Manager is accessed from the Site | Trash Manager menu option of the 
administrator menu:
It has two tabs, one showing the Content Items that have been trashed, another 
showing the Menu Items. From here, you can Restore an item to its original location, 
or Delete it completely from the system. You can click the checkbox in the header of 
the table to select all the items in the table, or check the box next to individual items 
to select only certain items. After you've done this, you click the Restore or Delete 
icons in the toolbar, depending on what the fate of these items is to be.

Chapter 8
[ 175 ]
For either action, you will be presented with a confirmation screen. Here is the 
Delete Items screen:
If you don't want to go through with this, click the Cancel button in the toolbar, or 
else click the Delete icon in the middle of the page. Clicking the Delete icon gives 
you yet another chance to be sure you know what you're doing:
Click OK now, and the item is finally gone.
That will remove a content item (or menu item) from the system; there is no way 
back for it now. You will need to do this to empty categories should you wish to 
delete them, as we mentioned earlier.
Archiving Content Items
If you don't want to delete old pieces of content, but want them moved off the site, 
you can move them to the archive. Note that moving an item to the archive does not 
move it to another table in the database, and does not make the size of your main 
content table in your database smaller. The content item doesn't really go anywhere, 
it just gets marked as being in the archive.

Managing Content
[ 176 ]
You move an item to the archive by checking the box next to its title in the Content 
Manager page, and then clicking the Archive button in the toolbar:
You can see the content items in the archive in the Archive Manager, accessed from 
the Content | Archive Manager administrator menu option. Alternatively, you 
will find that for sections where some of the items have been archived, a link to that 
section's archive appears in the Content | Content By Section ����������������������
menu for that section.
Content can be moved back from the archive by clicking the Unarchive icon in the 
Archive Manager. Content in the archive will still prevent the category it belongs to 
from being deleted.
Different Views of Content
Now that we have some bits of content, we turn our attention to the question of 
directing visitors towards the content.
There are essentially two ways that content can be displayed on a Mambo site, 
as single items or in a list. The front page of the site for example can show a list 
of content items. Click on one of the content items and that single content item is 
displayed to you.
There are essentially three views of content Mambo provides:
Display a single item of content.
List all the content items in a particular category (or in all the categories of a 
particular section).
Display all the content items in a particular category (or in all the categories 
of a particular section). In other words, list them and display their 
introductory text.
There is a fourth view provided by Mambo, which is to list the items on the homepage.
To choose a view, you choose a different type of menu entry from the Content panel 
of the New Menu Item page:
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 177 ]
There are three types of menu entry corresponding to the three views we 
mentioned before:
Link
Table
Blog
Single Item (Link) View
This is the standard way of linking a single item of content to a menu entry. The 
visitor clicks the menu entry and they see a single item of content. This is the type 
of menu entry that is created when you add a link from the Link to Menu tab of a 
content item's Advanced Details that we saw earlier.
Table Views
Table views list the titles of all the content items in a particular category, or in all the 
categories of a particular section.
Content Category View
The image overleaf shows a Table – Content Category view from the standard 
Mambo installation with the sample data:
•
•
•

Managing Content
[ 178 ]
Here you can see the category description, the category image, and underneath, the 
list of the content items in the category.
The presence of the Filter box, and the Order and Display # drop-down boxes, can 
be configured from the menu entry.
Clicking on the title of any content item will bring up that content item. If you like, 
the Table – Content Category view defines "virtual" menu items for its "children", 
namely the content items in the category. 
We will add a Table – Content Category view for the Course category of Club News.
From the Menu | mainmenu, click the New button in the toolbar, and select Table 
– Content Category:

Chapter 8
[ 179 ]
Click the Next button in the toolbar, enter Course into the Name field, and select the 
Course Information category from the list:
Click the Save button and your Content Category menu item is created.
Content Section View
Here we see a Table – Content Section view:
This time, as you would expect, the categories in this section are displayed, along 
with the section description, and its image.
Again, this display can be configured from the menu entry. One of the things that 
can be done is to display the description of the category in addition to its title.
Clicking on the title of the category brings up a Table - Content Category view of 
that category. 

Managing Content
[ 180 ]
Like the Table – Content Category view, the Table – Content Section view defines 
some "virtual" menu entries for its children, in this case the categories in the section.
We will add a Table - Content Section view for the Club News section, and 
afterwards, make our Course Category View a child of that menu item to nest it.
From Menu | mainmenu, click the New button in the toolbar, and select Table 
– Content Section:
Click the Next button, enter Club News into the Name field, and select the Club 
News section from the list:
Click the Save button in the toolbar, and your new menu item is created:
The final step is to make Course a child of the Club News menu item. Click the 
Course link in the table, and select Club News from the Parent dropdown:

Chapter 8
[ 181 ]
Click the Save button, and your menu structure is updated:
Repeat this process for the Tournaments and Membership categories; this time you 
can select Club News as the Parent when you create the menu items.
Assigning Templates to Table Views
Remember we mentioned in Chapter 6 that you could assign a template to a 
particular menu entry (which would correspond to a page)? When you assign 
a template to a menu entry of Table type, that template will be inherited by the 
"virtual" menu entries we spoke of above.
In other words, if you assign Template X to a Table – Content Category menu entry, 
then when you click the title of one of the content items to see that content item, the 
page template will still be Template X.
Similarly, if you assign Template X to a Table – Content Section menu entry, then 
clicking the title of one of the categories in the section would give you Template X for 
the list of content items in the category.

Managing Content
[ 182 ]
Blog Views
The Blog view presents the content items in a category or section like a weblog. 
This means that not only is the title of each item in a particular category or section 
displayed, but the introductory text is shown too.
There are three things that can be displayed in Blog format: categories, sections, or 
the archive.
We will add a Blog – Content Section menu item to display the President's blog. 
We created a section called The President for him earlier, and added his categories, 
The Future, The Course, Fun and Trivia. We still need some content items for 
those categories. The text for these content items can be found in this chapter's code 
download, so go ahead and create them.
To add the menu item, from Menu | mainmenu, click the New icon in the toolbar 
and select Blog – Content Section:
Click the Next button, enter President's Log into the Name field, and select The 
President from the Section list. 
By default, the blog is displayed as two columns, but we're going to change that to 
a more familiar one-column layout for the items, so set Columns in the Parameters 
panel to 1.
Click the Save button.
When you preview your site, click the President's Log menu entry, and provided 
you've added the categories and the content, you will be able to enjoy the wisdom of 
the Club President:

Chapter 8
[ 183 ]
If you like, you can edit the President's Log menu item, and use the Parameters to 
further change the way the items are displayed.
Static Content
Static content items are created in the same way as the content items we have 
just been describing. Static content items do not have any section or category 
organization, and are typically used for "standalone" pieces of content, like an 
"About Us" page, or as in the case of the standard Mambo installation, The Mambo 
License. They are used for "standalone" pieces of content because there is no support 
for creating an automatic listing of static content items in a particular place, because 
of their lack of section-category structure.
Static content items are managed from the Content | Static Content Manager 
menu option of the administrator menu. This manager is very similar to the Content 
Manager that we have spent time looking at, so we won't spend much time talking 
about it in detail, we'll just see how to set up an "About Zak Springs" area.
One drawback with static content items is unless they are going to be linked to from 
another piece of content, they will need a menu item for the visitor to find them. This 
is fine if the static content item is going to be a top-level menu item (like the Mambo 
license) but if you intend to have static content items nested, then you will need to 
create a parent page for them.

Managing Content
[ 184 ]
We will do this to create the "About Zak Springs" part of our site, including the 
"History of Zak Springs" page, and the "Location of Zak Springs" page.
This is the menu structure we're after:
About Zak Springs
	
History
	
Location
Both History and Location will be static content items, but we will also need to create 
a "holding" page called About Zak Springs, similar to the page displayed when you 
view a category.
From the Static Content Manager, click the New icon in the toolbar, give our new 
static item a title of About Zak Springs, and add the text below:
Zak Springs Golf Club is located near the Skull Mountains, and 
boasts two 18-hole golf courses, practice facilities, and extensive 
hospitality facilities.
The Nemesis course is a picturesque, par 72 course of over 7000 
yards. The other course is the Sinistra course. Both are in excellent 
condition, and present a formidable challenge for even the lowest-
handicap golfer.
Click the Link to Menu tab of the Advanced Details, and let's add a link to the 
Main menu:

Chapter 8
[ 185 ]
Click the Link to Menu button to add the link to this content item to the Main menu:
Now click the Save button in the toolbar.
Now we'll add the History of Zak Springs static content item as a child menu item 
of About Zak Springs. Click New in the Static Content Manager, and add the text 
for the History of Zak Springs item, which you'll find in this chapter of the code 
download. However, do not add this content item to the main menu, since you will 
only be able to add it to the top level of the menu. Once you've saved this static 
content item, select Menu | mainmenu, and click New in the toolbar to add a new 
menu item.
We'll add a Link – Static Content menu item:
Click the Next button in the toolbar, and from the Add Menu Item page, enter the 
name of History, select the History static content item from the Static Content box, 
and select About Zak Springs from the Parent drop-down box:

Managing Content
[ 186 ]
Click the Save icon in the toolbar, and you can see our About Zak Springs menu 
structure is underway:
Now when you preview the site, when you click About Zak Springs, the menu 
item will expand to show the History link. There is no link to the History item from 
the About Zak Springs page, apart from the menu item; there is no automatically 
generated list of content items like that from the content item table view. We could 
have used ordinary content items for this section, and got that automatic list, but we 
were after the nested menu structure. Even if we were using standard content items 
and table views, we would still have had to add the menu entries ourselves, so using 
static content items here has not really been too much of an inconvenience. Also, 
the nature of the material in the About Zak Springs area is that it will not change 
too often; we are unlikely to be adding new items here so there is no need for an 
automatic listing of the content.
You will find the text for the Location static content item in the code download, and 
you can add that under the About Zak Springs menu item to complete this part of 
the site.

Chapter 8
[ 187 ]
Managing Sections
We saw earlier how to create sections. Now we return to the topic of managing 
categories: copying and deleting them. �����������
We saw the Section Manager page earlier. 
It displays a list of the currently defined sections, and from here you perform the 
section management tasks.
Copying Sections
You can copy everything in a section (its categories, and the content items in those 
categories) by checking the box next to the section and clicking the Copy icon in 
the toolbar.
You will then be prompted to enter the name of the target section into which these 
contents will be copied, and then click the Save icon in the toolbar. You can only 
copy sections to new sections, you cannot copy sections to another, existing section. 
If you enter the name of an existing section to copy to, this will be rejected, and you 
will have to enter another section name.
A section will be created with the name you specify, and will contain everything 
from the original section. We said that categories belong to exactly one section, and 
to ensure this rule is followed, you will find that copies are actually made of all the 
categories, and all the content items within those categories.
Deleting Sections
Sections are deleted by checking the box next to their name and clicking the Delete 
icon in the toolbar. However, a section has to be completely empty before it can be 
deleted. This means it can't have any categories assigned to it. If there are categories 
that were assigned to the section, but have been trashed, they have to be completely 
removed from the trash before the section can be deleted.
In other words, the # Categories and # Trash columns have to be showing 0 before 
you can delete a section.
Managing Categories
We saw earlier how to create categories. Now we return to the topic of managing 
categories: copying, moving, and deleting.

Managing Content
[ 188 ]
Copying Categories to Different Sections
From the Category Manager page, a category �����������������������������������
 can be copied by checking the box 
next to the category you want to copy, and clicking Copy in the toolbar. You select 
the section to which you want to copy the category (the section must already exist), 
and a new category is created and assigned to the target section. The name of the 
new category is the same as the old category, with the words Copy of put at the 
start. Copies of all the content items in the category are created, and assigned to the 
copied category.
Moving Categories to Different Sections
We mentioned that you can't change the section a category is assigned by directly 
editing its details. To assign a category to a different section, you have to ��������
move ����
 it.
You can move a category by checking the box next to it in the Category Manager, 
and clicking Move in the toolbar.
Again, you select a target section from one of the existing sections, and the category 
will be reassigned to this section. There is no copy of the category created, and no 
copies of its content items are created.
Deleting Categories
Categories can only be deleted when they contain no content items, including 
content items that are in the trash. At this point in our explorations this is no problem 
since we've not created any content! However, the point of your site is to create some 
content, so generally, you will need to empty a category of content items before you 
attempt to delete the category. 
Once a category is empty of content items, including trashed items, simply check the 
checkbox next to the category and click the Delete icon in the toolbar. The category 
will be deleted; there is no prompt asking you if you are sure you want to delete the 
category. The reason there is no prompt is that the category is completely empty; if it 
had content items, you already had to delete them, which involves lots of prompting 
as we saw. In other words, the category has no dependencies, so deleting it shouldn't 
cause you a problem.

Chapter 8
[ 189 ]
Summary
In this chapter we looked at working with content items in the back end of the 
site. Content items are Mambo's versatile type of "content". We saw that content is 
organized into sections and categories, with categories sitting inside sections, and 
content items sitting inside categories.
We saw how to create sections and categories, and after a discussion of the section-
category structure for Zak Springs, we added some of these to our Zak Springs site.
After defining our content structure, we moved on to look at creating content 
items. We saw the mosimage mambot that gives another way to include images 
in our content and also control the formatting of the displayed image. We saw the 
various options that are available for each content item, including the keywords and 
description, publishing information such as publishing on a scheduled date, and also 
the Parameters that control such things as whether icons for printer-friendly versions 
of the content should be displayed along with the content item.
We also looked at how you can get different views of content by specifying a 
different type of menu item. We saw the single item (link) view, which displays on a 
single piece of content on a page, the table views for showing a list of content items 
in a category or a list of categories in a section, and the blog views for showing a list 
of content items in a category along with some of their text.
There are actually two "types" of content in Mambo; organized content and static 
content. The first part of the chapter was devoted to organized content (with the 
section and category structure), and then we looked briefly at static content. Static 
content has no organization, and is generally intended for standalone pieces of 
content that do not particularly require any "hierarchy" like the section-category type 
of content.
Finally, we had a look at managing sections and categories: copying, moving, and 
deleting them.
All of this content management was done in the administration area. Mambo enables 
certain users to create, edit, and publish content from the front end of the site, and 
provides a "workflow" to ensure that only approved content is shown on the site. 
This is our next stop.


Front-End Publishing 
Workflow
So far, you've been writing the content yourself, as the Super Administrator of the 
site. In Chapter 7, we created users that were members of the front-end author, 
editor, and publisher groups, and we said that they will be able to add content to the 
site through the front end. We will look at this now.
We will first see where new content items can be added, and then look at the 
"workflow" involved in publishing these content items to the site. Content submitted 
through the front end of the site does not automatically get published; it needs to be 
approved by an Administrator before this happens. 
Finally, we've have a look at the administration of comments.
Authoring Content
The first front-end group for working with content is the Author group. A user in 
this group once logged in can:
Submit a new content item to the site
Edit a content item they have previously submitted
As the name suggests, users in the Author group can only "author" content. This 
means that they can't edit any content except their own. 
Log on to the front end of the site as the Author user we set up in Chapter 7.
The first thing you should keep a lookout for, is a link that allows you to add a new 
content item. However, you might not find it so easy to locate this link first of all.
•
•

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 192 ]
Let's think about this for a moment. Suppose you were going to display a link, say 
add new content here, that when clicked will allow the author to add new content. 
Where would you put that link? 
If you put it on a page containing a content item, what exactly would add 
new content here mean? Content items belong to categories, they don't 
belong to other content items. You wouldn't expect to find your link on the 
page where a content item is displayed.
Would you put it after a list of the categories in a section? If you did, then 
which category would the content item go into?
If you put the link after a list of content items in a category, then add new 
content here would make sense. It would mean "add a new content item into 
this category". And that is exactly where you will find our mystery link.
Click on the News | Course Information menu link to bring up the list of items 
within the Course Information category.
Underneath the list of items in the category, you can see the New link:
Click this link, and you will be taken to a page with a URL of the form:
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_content&task=new&
sectionid=4&cid=1&Itemid=43
There are three things to note with this URL. The first is task=new. This indicates we 
want to add a new piece of content. The next things to note are the sectionid, which 
holds the ID of the section you want your content item to end up in, and cid, the ID 
of the category that the item will belong to.
On the page, you will be presented with a form similar to the Content Item New 
page in the Administrator area:
•
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 193 ]
Here you see a field for entering the title of the content item and a drop-down box 
filled with the categories from the chosen section (the section ID was included in the 
URL of the page remember), from which you actually have to select the category. 
Although the URL contains the ID of the category you want to add your item, for 
some reason, this category is not selected in the drop-down box by default, and you 
will have to select it yourself. (This seems rather an oversight.) You can also see the 
familiar HTML editor for the Intro Text. As you would expect, you can scroll down 
to find the HTML editor for the Main Text field.
Also, there is a mini toolbar here with the Save and Cancel buttons. As you already 
know, you click these buttons to both save and submit your content or cancel 
your submission.
Scroll down the screen further and you will see something similar to the Advanced 
Details panel that we saw on the Content Item New page in the Administrator area:

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 194 ]
There are only three tabs here, since the author is simply entering content, not 
deciding where it will go or how it will be displayed. The Images and Metadata 
tabs are familiar, (note that in the Content Item New page the tab was called Meta 
Info rather than Metadata), and allow you to add images to the content with the 
{mosimage} mambot, and enter a description and keywords for the page META tags.
One thing that is noticeably absent from the Publishing tab is an option to publish 
the content item. The author cannot publish items to the site directly, and the lack of 
the option here reflects this.
Can't Find the Save Button?
Sometimes you might not be able to see the Save button anywhere on this form to 
enter your content. This is because of the current template, which will have a fixed 
width for the portion of the page in which the form is displayed. If you scroll down 
to the bottom of the form, you will find scrollbars for the form, and you can use these 
to scroll the form along to its right-hand edge. Then scroll straight back up the screen 
and you will see the Save button.
Finding Submitted Content Items
Once content has been entered through this form and saved to the system, the 
back-end work can begin. On the back end, either the Super Administrator or a 
Manager can move a submitted content item on to publication. There are a couple of 
ways to locate newly submitted content items:
Navigate to the Latest Items tab in the control panel of the Administrator 
home page. Here you can click the title of the item to view its details, check 
or amend them, and if satisfied, set the content item to be published. This has 
the drawback of showing only a certain number of the most recently added 
content items. If you had a rush of content submitted, it is possible you might 
miss some of them.
If you know who the users in the Author group are, you can select their 
names from the All Authors drop-down box in the Content Items Manager 
page. Then you can see all the content submitted by that author, check it, or 
publish it straight away.
However, how do you know when something has actually been submitted?
The Author Notification Process
When a content item is submitted by an author, a notification process begins, to 
advise anyone who can approve the item for publication.
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 195 ]
It works like this:
When the item is submitted, a private message is sent to any administrator 
who has the Receive Submission Emails option set to Yes. (It's only Super 
Administrators or Administrators, not Managers unfortunately.)
When a private message is received (actually, when it's sent), the recipient 
should be notified by email if they have correctly configured Mail me on 
new Message from Messages | Configuration.
Thus there is no direct email notification when an item is submitted to the site. This 
notification process is not particularly helpful. The notification email that you have 
received a private message is of this form:
A new private message has arrived
The email also has this as its title. The Private Message itself looks like this:
A new content item has been submitted by [ author ] 
titled [ Again Added ] 
from section [ FAQs ]  
and category  [ Managing Content ]
None of these really say "A new content item has been submitted to the site, check it 
out here!", with a direct link to view the submitted item.
However, you can see the name of the user who submitted the content, so you can 
go to Content Items Manager and select their name from the Author drop-down box 
quite easily.
We played with Private Messages at the end of Chapter 4. If you sent some messages, 
and had a look at the email notification you received then, you would have found 
the text of the Private Message included in the email. This is not the case with the 
"front-end" notification we get after submitting a content item. That's because there 
are two separate Private Messages components; a front-end one and a back-end one. 
The Content component uses the front-end Private Messages component to send the 
message (and the notification), rather than the back-end component.
However, apart from the indirect notification, there is another element of 
frustration here:
The Manager back-end group can manage content; the Administrator cannot.
The Administrator back-end group can receive submission emails; the 
Manager group cannot.
•
•
•
•

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 196 ]
Together, these mean that by default, Mambo content Managers cannot receive direct 
notification when material is submitted through the front end of the site.
Editing Content
The next front-end group for working with content is the Editor group. A user in this 
group once logged in can:
Edit any content item on the site, provided they have access to it in the 
first place
Submit a new content item to the site
Log on to the front end of the site as the Editor user we set up in Chapter 7.
Now, as soon as you log in, things look immediately different:
Here you can see an icon for editing the content item right next to the title of the 
content item.
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 197 ]
Click this, and you'll be brought to a page where you can edit the content item:
Again, the Main Text is underneath, along with the Advanced Details panel to 
the side.
Click the Save icon and the changes made to the content item are immediately 
reflected on the site; there is no need for approval and publishing here, since this was 
only editing. The content item just edited was not written by the editor; the editor 
is able to any edit any content item they can lay their hands on, and the handy Edit 
icon is positioned next to the item.
An editor is also able to create new content items. You will find a similar link to the 
one you saw for the author earlier.
Click that link to add a new content item and the editor follows the same process 
as the Author for entering a new content item. If the item is submitted, it will need 
approval before it can be published to the site. The editor still cannot publish new 
content items to the site directly.

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 198 ]
Publishing Content
The third front-end group for working with content is the Publisher group. A user in 
this group logged in can:
Edit any content item on the site, provided they have access to it in the 
first place
Submit a new content item to the site and have it published immediately
We won't go through all the details of this; it is similar to everything we have seen 
above. The one difference is the Publishing tab of the Advanced Details when 
editing or creating a new content item:
You can set this item to be published directly to the site by selecting Published from 
the State drop-down box. Also, you can unpublish an item by setting its State to 
Unpublished. Once on the site, the content item can be edited by any publisher 
or editor.
Front-End User-Submitted Content
Mambo is not designed to allow general, registered users of the site to submit 
content items for approval and publication on the site. Mambo is designed for 
privileged groups of front-end users to do this instead. However, some components, 
like Web Links for example, do allow ordinary registered users to submit a web link. 
The Content component does not allow this.
•
•

Chapter 9
[ 199 ]
Making Mambo work in a more "community-driven" way, so that anyone with a user 
account can submit a content item, is a more challenging problem, and is beyond the 
scope of this book.
Adding Links to Submit Content
Remember we had to look around a bit to find the New icon to create a content 
item as an author? It would make more sense if there was a menu link that took us 
directly to the page for submitting content. However, we don't want this link to be 
available to everyone, since most people will not be able to use it anyway. 
Since you have to be at least logged on before you can even think of submitting 
content, the menu with the link should be visible at least to Registered users, which 
is exactly what the User menu is. Since not every registered user can submit content, 
the menu item itself will be for Special users. The Special users are authors, editors, 
or publishers. 
For Zak Springs, we're going to add some menu entries to the User menu. We will 
make these menu entries visible only to the Special users (Authors, Editors, and 
Publishers). These menu entries will provide direct links to submit the Club News 
content items, and so on.
All we need is a URL for the menu to point to...
Remember the form of the URL for the content item submission page?
http://localhost/zaksprings/index.php?option=com_content&task=new&
sectionid=4&cid=1&Itemid=43
That's almost what we want. All we need to do is find the section ID and category 
ID of the section and category we want the content item to go into, and we're done. 
The Itemid will be added automatically by Mambo when we add this link as a menu 
item, so we don't have to worry about that.
First, let's check the section ID of the Club News section. You can see this in the 
Section ID column of the section in the Section Manager. The screenshot below 
shows the value of 2:
Now we just need to add a Link – Url menu item to the usermenu.

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 200 ]
Select Menu | usermenu from the administration drop­-down menu to bring up the 
User menu screen, and click New in the toolbar to add a new menu item. Select a 
Link – Url type:
Click the Next button in the toolbar.
Add the information into this form as below. For the Link, we only add the section 
ID and not the category ID (cid), so that the front­-end user can add a content item 
into any of the categories in this section. We also set the Level to Special, so that only 
the front-end authors, editors, and publishers will see this menu item:
Click the Save button in the toolbar, and your menu entry is created.
Now when you log into the front end of the site with one of the author, editor or 
publisher accounts, you will see the Submit Club News link in the User menu. 
When you click it, you will find the link is now of the form index.php?option=com_
content&task=new&sectionid=2&Itemid=19, with the Itemid added by Mambo.

ter Publishing Workflow
As we've seen, the notification system of the front-end publishing seems rather 
odd in these ways: 
Managers (content managers) can't get notifications, Administrators (who 
can't manage content) can. 
The notification is via a private message. 
Provided that an Administrator has setup their private message 
configuration to notify them by email when a new private message is 
received (and provided their private message inbox is not locked), they will 
receive an email notification advising of the private message.
The Administrator needs to check the private message to be advised of the 
content item submission.
Of course, if they've gone to log in to check their private messages, they may as well 
look at the Latest Items tab in the Administrator front page, which will show them 
the most recently submitted content items.
In this section, we'll explore some other solutions for improving this workflow.
One solution is to create a virtual Administrator. This is an Administrator account 
that no one is actually able to access, and its sole purpose is to receive notifications of 
submitted content items. Of course, this account can have only one email address, so 
only one person can be mailed when an item is submitted.
However, the email address of this Administrator need not be a real email account, 
but can be an email alias. An email alias is an email address for which there is no 
corresponding email account. You could create, on your mail server, an email alias 
called contentmanagers for example, which could be configured to forward any 
mail received to each person responsible for approving and publishing content on 
the Mambo site; these would be Managers rather than Administrators.
In this way, you could have all people responsible for managing content notified 
when a new content item is submitted with only one email sent by Mambo. 
However, the problem with that is that each person will receive a rather useless 
private message notification:
A new private message has arrived.
They still have no idea what the private message says. The exact notification of the 
content item submission is in the private message, which they would still need to 
check. So this isn't ideal.

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 202 ]
There are two ways we could go above solving this:
Modify the Content component to send email notifications directly
Modify the Messages component to send a better email notification
The Messages component contains only two files, which together total only 4KB in 
size. The Content component has more files, and these are bigger. For the simplest 
solution, modifying the private message notification seems the easiest way to go.
Open the com_messages folder in the components folder of your Mambo installation, 
and open the file messages.class.php in a text editor. This file contains the 
mosMessage class, which is responsible for sending private messages.
If you're familiar with PHP, you'll have no difficulty in locating the send() function:
function send( $from_id=null, $to_id=null, $subject=null, 
               $message=null ) {
       global $database;
       global $mosConfig_site_name;
This function sounds like just what we're after. If you look through this function, 
you'll see these lines:
$config = $database->loadObjectList( 'cfg_name' );
       $locked = @$config['lock']->cfg_value;
       ���������������������������������������������
$domail = @$config['mail_on_new']->cfg_value;
       ���������������
if (!$locked) {
          �������������������������������
$this->user_id_from = $from_id;
          ���������������������������
$this->user_id_to = $to_id;
          $this->subject = $subject;
          ��������������������������
$this->message = $message;
          $this->date_time = date( "Y-m-d H:i:s" );
          ���������������������
if ($this->store()) {
              ��������������
if ($domail) {
                 ��������������Q����������������������������������
$database->setQuery( "SELECT email FROM #__users 
                                        WHERE id='$to_id'" );
                 �������������������������������������
$recipient = $database->loadResult();
                 ���������������������������������������������������
$subject = T_('A new private message has arrived');
                 �����������������������������������������������
$msg = T_('A new private message has arrived');
                 ��������������������������������������������������
mosMail($mosConfig_mailfrom, $mosConfig_fromname, 
                                      $recipient, $subject, $msg);
               }
             return true;
           }
       }

The first line here gets the private message configuration, and the next two lines 
store the configuration values in variables. If the inbox isn't locked, then the message 
is sent:
      ���������������
if (!$locked) {
          $this->user_id_from = $from_id;
          $this->user_id_to = $to_id;
          $this->subject = $subject;
          $this->message = $message;
          $this->date_time = date( "Y-m-d H:i:s" );
          if ($this->store()) {
The last line above "sends" the message, which actually just stores it in the database. 
We can see that the $message variable could be useful to us; it looks like it is the 
content of the private message.
If the message has been "sent" OK, in other words, there was no problem storing it 
in the database, then the email notification is sent (provided the user is receiving 
email notifications):
          ���������������������
if ($this->store()) {
              ��������������
if ($domail) {
                 ��������������Q����������������������������������
$database->setQuery( "SELECT email FROM #__users 
                                        WHERE id='$to_id'" );
                 �������������������������������������
$recipient = $database->loadResult();
                 ���������������������������������������������������
$subject = T_('A new private message has arrived');
                 �����������������������������������������������
$msg = T_('A new private message has arrived');
                 ��������������������������������������������������
mosMail($mosConfig_mailfrom, $mosConfig_fromname, 
                                      $recipient, $subject, $msg);
               }
             return true;
           }
The email address of the recipient is got from the database, and the subject and 
body of the email are constructed. It seems reasonable that the $msg variable holds 
the body of the email message (it certainly matches the body of the emails that we 
receive). The T_() function allows the text to be returned in the current language. 
The mosMail() function sends the mail.
It would seem that all we have to do is modify $msg, and we will get a better email 
notification about a private message. Since we have the body of the private message 
in the $message variable, it seems pretty easy:
Modify the $msg line like this:
              $msg = "A new private message has arrived\n\n----------
                      ---\n\n$message";

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 204 ]
The \n characters put line breaks into the message, (we've changed the ' to " to use 
these characters within the string), we have a sequence of dashes to break up the text, 
then we simply dump in the private message body with the $message variable.
There is one more thing we need to do before we test this. We need to add the 
highlighted line to the start of the function:
function send( $from_id=null, $to_id=null, $subject=null, 
  $message=null ) {
      global $database;
      global $mosConfig_site_name;
      global $mosConfig_mailfrom, $mosConfig_fromname;
In the current version of Mambo, the line that sends the mail attempts to use the two 
variables $mosConfig_mailfrom and $mosConfig_fromname. However, these are 
global variables and the global statement is needed to allow them to have values 
within the function. By convention, we add the statement to the start of the function.
Now we're ready to go. Save the messages.class.php file, go to the administration 
area, and send yourself a private message, making sure you've set yourself up to 
receive email notifications.
Once that's working, make sure there is an Administrator account set to receive 
notifications when content is submitted, and that the email address of this account is 
one you can access (you may want to turn off the unique email address requirement 
in the Global Configuration first!).
After that, log into the front end of the site with one of the editor or author accounts, 
and add a new content item. 
Now things are a bit more helpful. You'll get a message like:
A new private message has arrived
-----------------------------------------------
A new content item has been submitted by [ author ]  titled [ I added this myself ]  
from section [ Getting Started ]  and category  [ Getting Started ]
If we wanted to go a step further, and actually add the link to view the content item 
in the administration area, we would need to make some (simple) modifications 
to the Content component. For now, we'll leave things here. Already, we've got 
a simple solution to notify any of the relevant Zak Springs staff when someone 
submits a new content item.

Chapter 9
[ 205 ]
To fully implement this solution, we'll create an Administrator called cmnotifier, 
and set its email address to contentmanagers@zaksprings.com, and in fact, 
we'll deactivate that account (this does not affect the sending of notifications). We 
deactivate the account since it has no real purpose other than to receive notifications. 
We'll get the mail server setup to forward mails for that address to the relevant 
people who manage content. Of course this means that part of our solution has 
moved outside of Mambo, but it's much more straightforward than making even 
more alterations to the Mambo code.
Managing Comments
When looking round the Mambo site with the sample data, you may have seen the 
Write Comments link under some content items:
The Comments feature of Mambo is powered by a component, but there is also a 
mambot for displaying the comments.
The mambot is called MOS Comment and is enabled by default. We haven't talked 
much about managing mambots so far, but they are managed in a familiar way from 
the Mambots | Site Mambots administrator drop-down menu:

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 206 ]
You can click the graphic in the Published column to enable or disable a mambot. 
In addition to the MOS Comment mambot, there is a mambot called MOS Rating 
that controls the rating feature for comment items, allowing items to be rated and 
displaying the rating.
If you want to turn off the Comments feature at any point, simply unpublish the 
MOS Comment's mambot and people won't be able to see or post comments. 
(Similarly for the MOS Rating mambot to prevent people rating or seeing the rating 
for a content item). Currently there is no way to turn off the submission of comments 
but retain the display.
Comments can be added by an Administrator through the back end, or submitted by 
a user through the front end of the site from the form under a content item:
Exactly who can submit comments, what content items they can be submitted 
for and what happens after a comment is submitted can be configured from the 
Components | Comment | Edit Settings option of the administrator drop-down 
menu. There are three tabs for managing the comments settings (this is a view from 
sample data site):
The first tab allows you to select which sections comments can be added to. Any 
content item in a category belonging to one of these sections can be commented on 
if they are selected in the Sections available: box. (Multiple section selections can be 
made here).

Chapter 9
[ 207 ]
The Autopublish Comments option determines if comments should be published 
to the site as soon as they are submitted. The default value is Yes, and this means 
that any submitted comment is automatically published without any Administrator 
intervention. Selecting No means that an Administrator will need to "approve" a 
comment after it is submitted.
If you want to restrict comment posting only to registered users, set the Anonymous 
Comments option to No. The default value is Yes, which means anyone can post a 
comment to the site. A comment posted by a user who isn't logged in will be marked 
as submitted by GUEST.
The second tab, Notification, determines what should happen when a comment is 
submitted. If the Notify Admin option is set to Yes, then a mail will be sent to the 
Site Administrator. The email address for the Administrator here is specified in the 
Mail From option in the Mail tab of the Global Configuration. 
Note that unlike content item submissions, there is no private 
message sent to a set of Administrators advising of the 
submission of a comment.
Finally, the Admin tab allows you to specify the maximum number of characters in a 
submitted comment.
Preventing Comment Spam
The default values for the Autopublish Comments and Anonymous Comments 
options mean that you could be victim of "comment spam". Comment spam is the 
(automatic) posting of random comments to articles, blog posts, and so on, with 
a link to some target site somewhere. This is done to improve the search engine 
visibility of the target site (since it has more links pointing to it), but the type of sites 
that use comment spam are generally not the type of site you want to see featured on 
your site. Often, they sell products most of us would regard as "dubious".
You can prevent comment spam by either restricting comment submission to 
registered users, or, to make more work for yourself, setting Autopublish Comments 
to No, so an Administrator has to approve a comment before it goes on the site.
Another way to prevent comment spam is to set the Use Captcha Authentication 
option of the Global Configuration to Yes. Doing that makes some graphical text 
appears under the comment form, and the submitter needs to correctly identify the 
text displayed in the graphic before their submission is accepted:

Front-End Publishing Workflow
[ 208 ]
Sometimes, the graphical text is very difficult to make out. This graphical 
text‑confirmation approach is a common technique for preventing automated 
comment posting.
Viewing and Approving Comments
You can view all the submitted comments from Components | Comment | View 
Comments. You are presented with a familiar-looking table listing the comments:
You should be used to this kind of table by now. You can delete comments, publish 
or unpublish them, or even create a new comment.
You can edit a comment by clicking its text in the comment in the table to take you to 
the Edit Comments screen:

Chapter 9
[ 209 ]
This gives you a chance to maybe "censor" or "tone down" the comment, another 
chance to publish or unpublish it, or even assign it to a different content item.
Summary
In this chapter we looked at how users that were members of the front-end author, 
editor, and publisher groups can add, edit, or even publish content to the site 
through the front end. 
We had a look around to find the links that would allow the users to add or edit their 
content, and then had a look at the "workflow" involved in publishing these content 
items to the site, and the notification system that kicks in when one of these users 
submits some content. The notification system is based around private messages, and 
Administrators will only receive email notifications if they have correctly configured 
their private messaging to send emails when they receive private messages.
Finally, we had a look at the Comments feature in Mambo that allows users to add 
their own views on published content items.


Finishing the Site Off with 
Other Extensions
So far, we've spent a long time dwelling on the content management features of 
Mambo, and we also had a quick look at the Web Links component. There are a 
couple more useful components in Mambo, but there are also a number of other, 
third-party components and modules that can add extra functionality to our site.
In this chapter, we'll look at these third-party "extensions":
The ExtCal Event component
The MamboBoard forums component
The zOOm Gallery picture gallery
We looked at installing components and modules using the Mambo Universal 
Installer in Chapter 5. You may want to refresh your memory of this for when we 
start installing the third-party extensions.
Standard Extensions
There are a number of "standard" extensions that ship with the complete version of 
Mambo. We'll cover a selection of them here.
Polls
A poll is a multiple-choice question for your visitors. You can view a list of the polls 
from Components | Polls in the administrator menu. Clicking on the poll question 
allows you to edit the question and the possible answers, and then attach the poll to 
any menu item (page). The poll itself is displayed with the Polls module, and once 
the user selects an answer and clicks on either RESULTS or VOTE, the results of the 
poll can be seen:

News Feeds
We had a quick look at the News Feeds component in Chapter 5 when we were 
experimenting with menu items. The News Feeds component grabs the RSS feed 
from a particular site and displays the stories. The sites themselves are defined 
from Components | Newsfeeds | Manage Newsfeeds, and the sites are organized 
into categories, which can be managed from Components | Newsfeeds | 
Manage Categories.
Syndicate
The Syndicate component does the opposite of the News Feed component; it sets 
up your site for syndicating your content. From Components | Syndicate you can 
control such things as the title of your news feed, its description, the number of items 
in the feed, and the ordering. The content items included in your news feed are the 
stories that would be displayed on the front page of the site, and it is also possible to 
control the order in which the content items are displayed in the feed.

Chapter 10
[ 213 ]
People find your news feed with the Syndicate module:
By clicking on one of these icons, or dragging it into an RSS news reader, a visitor 
can get your feed. The feed is available in a range of specifications; different versions 
of RSS, ATOM (see http://www.atomenabled.org/ for more information), and 
OPML (http://www.opml.org/), which should suit almost anyone's taste.
Banners
With the Banners component you get facilities for creating and managing advertising 
clients, displaying banner adverts on your site, and managing the count of 
impressions. An impression is when the banner is displayed to a visitor, and when a 
visitor clicks on the banner to visit the advertiser site, a click-through is recorded.
First of all, you need some clients, and these are set up from Banners | Manage 
Clients in the administrator menu.
Once your client is set up, you can create their banner from Banners | Manage 
Banners. You upload the banner image by clicking the Upload icon in the toolbar, 
and after clicking Browse in the dialog that appears, you select your image from the 
file browser. The graphic is uploaded to the folder images\banners in your Mambo 
installation. Once you've uploaded the banner image, you can enter the banner 
details, selecting the client and the banner image from the drop-down box, and also 
the number of impressions that client's banner will be allowed before the banner is 
removed. Since the banner is actually a link to your client's site, a target URL will 
also be needed:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 214 ]
When the banner is displayed, it does not actually link to the target client site, it 
points to your site, where a click is recorded, and then the visitor is redirected to the 
target site. This is how the click count is updated.
Once you've entered the details of your banner and saved, then you can see the 
list of current banners, along with their remaining impressions and also the 
click-through count:
The banner is displayed on the front end of the site through the Banners module. 
This module will display all the published banners, but also allows you to specify a 

Chapter 10
[ 215 ]
particular client so that only the banners from that client are shown. Once the banner 
has been viewed more times than its allowed number of impressions, the banner is 
not just removed from the front end of the site, it is actually deleted from the system!
ExtCal Event Component
This third-party component adds a calendar to the front end of your site, to which 
users and administrators can add events. At Zak Springs, this component will be 
used to provide a calendar of upcoming club events, such as tournaments.
We actually downloaded and installed the ExtCal Event component (and one of the 
modules) in Chapter 5. If you didn't do that then, you can download the component 
from its project page at the MamboXchange website: 
http://mamboxchange.com/projects/extcalendar/
Events are categorized, and these categories are managed from the Manage 
Event Categories option of the ExtCal Calendar administrator menu entry. 
There is a General category added by default. We'll add a category called 
Strokeplay Competitions by clicking the New icon in the toolbar and adding the 
category information:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 216 ]
Before we add some events, we need to make some configuration changes. When 
you click the ExtCal Settings option in the ExtCal Calendar administration menu 
entry, you may be surprised to be confronted with a page of information rather than 
a page of settings. To get started on the settings, you need to click the Edit Settings 
icon in the toolbar:
This brings you to a long page of configuration settings. You will have to duplicate 
some of the Mambo configuration settings here, for example, you will need to 
enter the details of your mail server again into the Mail Settings section of the 
Calender Settings; the component does not seem to take this information from the 
Mambo core.
In the General Settings, the Calendar Administrator email is worth setting to your 
email address. When new events are added to the calendar, a notification email 
can be sent to the account specified here, so that the events can be approved for 
publication. The people who can add events to the calendar are also controlled from 
the General Settings section:

Chapter 10
[ 217 ]
One thing you might have noticed is that there doesn't seem to be any way to add 
events in the back end of the site; we've seen a Manage Event Categories page, and a 
settings page, but no "Add an Event" page. That's because the events are added at the 
front end of the site. By default, anyone can submit events.
You can restrict this to allow only registered users or administrators to submit events 
from the Who Can Submit New Events option here. Who can edit or delete events 
can also be controlled. Events submitted by anyone other than administrators need 
to be approved by one of the administrators.
The word administrator here refers to a member of the back-end Administrator 
group (or Super Administrator group). A member of the Manager group will not be 
able to access the back-end ExtCal functionality.
What can be added for the details of an event is controlled by the Add Event View 
settings. First of all, you can turn off the feature to allow non-administrators to add 
events by setting Enabled to No in this section:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 218 ]
The section also contains options for controlling the type of content that can be 
added to the details of an event.
We're going to set Enabled to No (Yes is the default value), and click the Save icon in 
the toolbar to save our settings.
There are a number of settings for controlling the look and behavior of the calendar 
component that you can experiment with.
Now we've got our basic calendar set up, let's add a menu entry to link to the 
ExtCal component. We'll add a menu entry called Events, of type Component to the 
mainmenu. Enter Events for the Name, select the ExtCal Calendar component, click 
Save, and our calendar will become visible.

Chapter 10
[ 219 ]
From the front end of the site, clicking the Events menu link brings up the calendar:
That's nice, but there's not an event in site! More than that, there seems to be no way 
of adding an event. Since only administrators can add an event, we'd better log into 
the front end of the site as one of our administrators (the Super Administrator will 
do), and after doing this and clicking the Events link again, you'll see the button for 
adding events:
Clicking the Add Event icon allows us to add an event. We'll enter details of the 
Zak Springs Gold Medal event, which will be an all day event, in the Strokeplay 
Competition category:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 220 ]
There are also options to make this event recur (which will be useful for the Monthly 
Medal event), and also an Event Approved option (checked by default) to have the 
event immediately published to the calendar

Chapter 10
[ 221 ]
Here is a view of this event in the Flat View:
This has been a quick run-through of the ExtCal component. There are lots of options 
for controlling the look of the calendar further, and also, the ability to allow users to 
submit events adds even greater flexibility.
User-Submitted Events
If you decide to allow users to submit events, then one of the administrators will 
need to approve the event before it goes onto the calendar.
Once an event is submitted, an email notification is sent to the address 
specified previously:
The following event has just been posted on your Zak Springs 
ExtCalendar and requires approval:
Title: "Zak Springs Unfair Medal"
Date: "2006-10-10 08:00:00"
Duration: "-2507 Day -7 Hour -60 Minute"
You can access this event by clicking the link below or copy and paste 
it in your web browser.

to work.)

Note that unlike the rather clumsy content-submission notifications we saw in 
the previous chapter, this notification has a direct link for you to click to view the 
submitted event. If you follow the link, you will get straight to the submitted event.
When logged in as an administrator, newly submitted events are clearly indicated 
to you:
Clicking the link brings you to the list of pending events:
You can either click the checkmarked icon to approve the event immediately, or the 
crossed icon to delete it. Clicking the edit (pencil) icon allows you to edit it before 
approving it. Clicking the title of an event gives you a preview:
From here, you can click the edit icon to edit it and approve it, or the delete icon to 
remove it. (This view of the event is the page that the link in the email notification 
points to.)

libellous event above!), then click on it in one of the calendar views, and you will be 
presented with the preview we saw above. You can use the delete icon to remove all 
occurences of this event.
ExtCal Modules
There are two modules that can be downloaded from the ExtCal project page at the 
MamboXchange website: MiniCal and the Latest Events module.
The MiniCal module (identified as ExtCal in the list of modules) displays a 
miniature calendar, with the dates of events highlighted:
The Latest Events module is highly configurable, and provides a list of some of the 
upcoming events in the calendar. The number of events to show and the amount 
of information to show about each event are among the many things that can be 
controlled from this module's Parameters:

MamboBoard Forums Component
The MamboBoard discussion board component provides a threaded discussion 
environment. People can post topics in forums, other people can reply to the 
posts, and people can continue to reply to the replies, creating a nested stream of 
discussion. Or they can just make new posts!
This component can be downloaded from:
http://mamboxchange.com/projects/mamboboard/
Here you will find the main MamboBoard component, and also some modules for 
displaying the top posters.
The component can be downloaded and installed from your local hard drive, or else 
you can enter the URL directly into the Install from HTTP URL field in the Installer 
| Universal. The current URL for the MamboBoard component is:
http://mamboxchange.com/frs/download.php/8273/
Mamboboard1.4_Stable.zip
Once it is installed, you will see a MamboBoard Forum link added to the 
Components administrator menu:
Clicking this brings you to the main MamboBoard administration area:

Chapter 10
[ 225 ]
With these icons you can configure your forum, manage moderators, set permissions 
and so on. MamboBoard integrates with the standard Mambo user accounts, so that 
any user registered with your site will be able to post to the forum.
Forum Organization
Rather than having a single discussion area, with topics intermingling with other 
topics, themes of conversation are organized into a number of different containers, 
rather like the folder and file structure of your hard disk.
The top level of organization is the category. Within categories, the next level of 
organization is into forums. Forums consist of topics, and finally, users are able to 
creating postings on these topics. Thus categories, forums, and topics act like folders, 
with postings being analogous to the files, to continue the file system analogy.
Only forum administrators can create categories and forums. Topics (and obviously 
postings, since they are the real body of a discussion area) can be added by users of 
the forum. A topic is essentially a 'first' posting, with subsequent postings on that 
topic being replies to the topic subject.

[ 226 ]
Here is a diagram of the forums hierarchy:
Although a forum is contained in a category, the term "forum" is generally used 
informally to refer to the whole discussion environment, covering categories, forums, 
topics, and postings. When you "post to a forum", you are actually posting to a topic 
in a particular forum of a certain category! The general term "board" or "discussion 
board" is usually used to refer to the whole forum experience.
Board Configuration
Before we create forums and topics for users to post to, we need to set up some 
basic board configuration first. This is done by clicking the MamboBoard 
Configuration icon.
This brings you to a tabbed form, similar to the Global Site Configuration.
The first thing to do is to set the email address of the forum administrator.

Chapter 10
[ 227 ]
Creating Forums
Now we have our basic configuration out of the way, we will need to create some 
forums for people to post in.
Creating a forum is done by clicking the Forum Administration link. This brings you 
to the MamboBoard Administration page, which will display a list of the current 
categories and forums, but at the moment, it will be blank, since we have no forums. 
Let's not hang around, so click the New icon in the toolbar to begin creating a forum:
Before we can create a forum, we need to create a category to hold it. To create 
a category or a forum, simply enter its Name and Description, and click the 
Save button.
What you just created will be a forum or category depending on what you selected 
in the Parent drop-down box. If you left Top Level Category selected, you created 
a category. If you chose something else from the list, you created a forum. It won't 
take you long to work out that the elements in the Parent drop-down box are the 
categories, since you can't set a forum to be the parent of another forum.
We'll create a category called Nemesis Course, which will be used to hold forums 
about each hole on the course.
Now that we have a category, the list of categories looks a bit better:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 228 ]
Note that your forum or category will not be published by default, you will need 
to click its graphic in the Published column to publish it. Without publishing your 
forum or category, it will not be visible to users.
Now we've got our category, we can create a forum (we'll call it Hole 1), and set 
Nemesis Course as its Parent:
After entering the details, and clicking Save, we've got a forum structure for people 
to look at, so let's allow people to look at it (and hopefully post!).
Adding a Menu Link to the Forums
At the moment, you would have to guess the URL of the forum to view it, and this 
isn't a particularly good navigation strategy. Instead, we can add a menu item to 
point to the forums component, in the way that we have done over the last few 
chapters.
We'll add a link called Forums, of type Component. All we have to do is to select the 
MamboBoard Forum item from the Component box, click Save, and our forums 
are ready.

Chapter 10
[ 229 ]
Now visitors will be able to view the forum. If you don't want to allow people to see 
the forums until they have logged in, you can do this in two ways:
Set the Access Level of the menu item to Registered.
Leave the Access Level of the menu item as Public, but set the Registered 
Users Only option on the Security tab of the MamboBoard Configuration 
to Yes.
The difference between these two approaches is that the first option will hide the 
menu item unless the user is logged in, whereas the second will leave the menu item 
visible (to indicate that you have forums on your site). You can choose whichever 
you prefer for your site. You can of course combine them both if you like!
Note that setting Registered Users Only on the Security tab to No will mean that 
not only can unregistered users see the forum, they can also post, which may not be 
what you want.
Now that our forum is set up, log in and start posting!

zOOm Media Gallery Component
The zOOm Media Gallery component allows you to create and organize galleries for 
holding images, and upload media to those galleries.
When an image from a zOOm gallery is displayed on the front end of the site, there 
is a rather nice surprise displayed along with it, which we will leave you to discover 
for yourself. There is a clue in the title of the component.
We'll only scratch the surface of this component here. There are many options to 
this component, and we'll cover the basics of getting your galleries set up, and 
media uploaded.
The zOOm Media Gallery component can be downloaded from the Downloads link 
of www.zoomfactory.org.
You will have to click the Joomla! 1.x Downloads link since the main support for the 
zOOm Media Manager module is now based around Joomla! rather than Mambo, 
although at this moment, the component is still compatible with Mambo. Once you 
have obtained and installed the current version of the zOOm Media Manager, you 
are ready to go.
The zOOm gallery is managed from the Media Gallery Admin System, reached 
from Components | zOOm Media Gallery:

Chapter 10
[ 231 ]
Here you will find options to create new galleries, manage your media, compute the 
code to use in a mambot that allows you to include images from your gallery in 
your content items, modify the configuration settings, and clean up the media 
gallery system.
First of all, we need to create some galleries to hold the media. We're going to create 
a gallery for the Nemesis Course, holding pictures of the holes on the course. This 
gallery will contain some subgalleries, Front Nine for pictures of the first nine holes, 
and Back Nine, for pictures of the last nine holes.
Click the Gallery Manager icon and let's begin. (If you hover your mouse cursor 
over the icons their names are displayed. The Gallery Manager icon is the one with 
the text that starts create new galleries ...)
First of all, the Mainscreen link at the top takes you back to the zOOm gallery 
options. The left-hand panel shows a tree view of your galleries (when created). 
You'll be able to expand entries in the tree, and click on the galleries to edit their 
details from this screen.
Creating Galleries
To create our new gallery, we need to provide the Title of the gallery, which will be 
The Nemesis Course. The Directory is provided for you; it corresponds to a folder 
on the server created by zOOm that will hold the images you upload. Underneath is 
a Description field (not shown in the screenshot above), in which we'll enter a 

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 232 ]
description for this gallery: Holes from the Nemesis Course. Once you've entered 
these details, click the New Gallery icon to save your changes (it's the one that looks 
like the familiar Save icon).
The tree view in the left-hand panel will update to show your new gallery:
Now we'll create another gallery, this time sitting inside The Nemesis Course 
gallery. This time, give it a title of Front Nine, and enter The First Nine Holes on the 
Nemesis Course at Zak Springs into the Description field. From the Parent gallery 
dropdown, select The Nemesis Course; selecting the Parent gallery in this way is 
how you nest galleries. Click the New Gallery icon and this gallery is created. You 
can repeat the process for the Back Nine gallery, or else you can move on to adding 
some images!
When you're done, click the Mainscreen link to return to the main options.
Adding Images
Images are added by clicking the Media Manager icon. First of all, you're asked 
to select one of the created galleries. We're going to add images to the Front Nine 
gallery, so select that from the dropdown.
This brings you to the (zOOm) Media Manager:

Chapter 10
[ 233 ]
From here you can upload images, edit their details, move them into a new gallery, 
or delete them entirely. The graphic with a star allows you to upload images, so let's 
click that (note a window may pop up about the Java applet used by this part of the 
zOOm gallery; simply click to accept it). This brings you to the Upload file screen:
There are several ways you can upload images. You can upload a ZIP file containing 
your images from the first tab, or you can upload a collection of files from the second 
tab, or use a Java applet to select files directly from your file system, or scan 
a directory on the server (not your local machine!) for a set of images from the 
fourth tab.
In the code download for this chapter you'll find a ZIP file containing a few holes 
from Zak Springs. Grab that, click the Browse button on the single (ZIP) file tab, and 
select that ZIP file. Check the Set media names with original filenames option so the 
filenames are preserved, then click the Upload button.

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 234 ]
When the page reloads, you are presented with the images contained in the ZIP file:
We don't want to rotate the images, and we want to use all these images, so let's 
just click Upload file(s). You will return to the Upload file screen, and should see a 
message telling you 3 media uploaded succesfully! Now click the Go Back link to 
see the images in the (zOOm) Media Manager:

Chapter 10
[ 235 ]
From here, you can check the box next to one of the images and edit its details to 
provide a title and description, move the image to another gallery, etc. Our work 
here is done, for now, so let's get a menu item added so that we can see the gallery.
Let's add a menu item called The Course to the Main menu. The menu item type 
needs to be Component – Component, and we simply have to select the zOOm 
Media Gallery from the list of components:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 236 ]
After saving the menu item, and clicking the The Course link from the front end of 
the site, we get a view of the gallery:
Not much to see here, so let's click the The Nemesis Course link. Once again, we 
don't see any pictures, we'll just see the subgalleries Front Nine and Back Nine. 
Click the Front Nine link, and hopefully our luck will change:
Now we're getting somewhere. Most of the things that you see here can be 
configured from the settings of the zOOm Media Gallery Admin System. Note 
that you are seeing real thumbnails of the images you uploaded; these thumbnails 
are created by zOOm and stored on the server. This means that until people click 
on your final image, they will only see smaller versions of the image, reducing the 
bandwidth used, and also speeding up the download. Clicking one of the images 
will display the image in its glory:

Chapter 10
[ 237 ]
Under the image are a number of properties of the image, along with a panel for 
visitors to add comments. All of this is again configurable from the settings of the 
zOOm Media Gallery Admin System.
The zOOm Media Gallery Admin System has a massive number of options, spread 
across a number of tabs:

Finishing the Site Off with Other Extensions
[ 238 ]
Incredibly, the number of thumbnails displayed per page is 9, which is exactly the 
number we'd have in our galleries! The Layout tab contains a number of options for 
controlling the display of the galleries:
From here you can set whether the filename of the image should be displayed, 
whether the description should be displayed, whether comments can be submitted, 
and so on.
To round things off, we can use the mod_zoom_pics module (which can also be 
found at the www.zoomfactory.org site) to display thumbnails of the holes on the 
side of the page. Once you've installed this module, you will find that there a number 
of parameters for controlling how the images are displayed.
As you will have guessed as we worked through this example, there is much more 
to the zOOm Media Gallery than we can cover here, so have fun finding your way 
round the rest of it!
Summary
In this chapter we've covered a number of extensions, both components and 
modules, for Mambo. We looked first at some of the standard Mambo components, 
Polls, Newsfeeds, Syndicate, and Banners.
After that, we looked at the ExtCal Event Component. For Zak Springs, this 
component will be used to provide a calendar of upcoming club events, in particular, 
tournaments. We saw that users can submit their own events, and how to delete 
events. We also had a quick look at some of the modules that go with ExtCal, which 
display handy little views of the forthcoming events.

Chapter 10
[ 239 ]
Next was the MamboBoard Forums component, which provides a threaded 
discussion environment. We saw the basics of organizing the forums and boards, 
and also adding a menu item so that users can actually use our forums.
Finally, we had a look at the awesome zOOm Media Gallery component, which 
we used to display images of some holes from Zak Springs. We saw how to create 
galleries, and how to upload images to those galleries. I tried hard not to tell you 
about the remarkable feature you see when the image is displayed on the front end 
of the site; I think you will enjoy it!


Customizing a Template
In this chapter we'll walk through making some basic customizations to one of the 
existing Mambo templates to produce a very different looking template for Zak 
Springs. We'll change the header graphic and the page background, customize the 
main content area, change the way modules and the menus are displayed, and so on.
We'll finish off with the steps required to turn your template into a unit that can be 
installed onto another Mambo site.
First, let's talk about what you will need to work with templates.
What You Need
We'll be working with three main things in our template activities; PHP code files, 
the CSS stylesheet, and graphics. 
You don't need to know very much about PHP to work with the PHP code file in the 
template, partly because there isn't much PHP code in the file, it is mostly HTML 
markup. To edit the PHP code file you can use a standard text editor, like Notepad or 
one of the other free text editors like the excellent PSPad (available from www.pspad.
com). The code file in question isn't that large or complex, and there isn't much to 
gain from editing this file in a more complex HTML editing application like Adobe's 
Dreamweaver or FrontPage.
The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is another plain text file, and can also be edited in a 
text editor. When doing further work on the stylesheet, you may find the extended 
features of a Dreamweaver-like application helpful, but for our work here, the text 
editor will suffice.
Editing the CSS file isn't particularly the problem here. The problem could be how 
comfortable you are working with CSS. As you'll see, most of the formatting for the 
template is governed by the CSS file. We'll take you through most of what you need 

Customizing a Template
[ 242 ]
to perform the tasks here, but to get serious with Mambo templates, growing your 
knowledge of CSS is a good idea.
You will find any number of CSS tutorials on the web, and if you want to read some 
more, Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML (O'Reilly, ISBN: 0-596-10197-X) and 
CSS Web Site Design Hands on Training (Peachpit Press, ISBN: 0-321-29391-6) by the 
legendary Eric Meyer are excellent introductions to CSS.
We'll be doing some work with graphics in the course of making our template 
as well. For this, you'll need some kind of image editing application, such as 
PhotoShop, PhotoShop Elements, or something like the open-source GIMP 
application. Any of these will be able to help you perform the kind of tasks we do in 
this chapter, and much more.
There is another set of tools that will be very helpful when working with templates, 
browser tools. There are a number of tools that you can plug into your browser that 
can help you work out what style is being applied to what part of the page, and also 
the overall structure of the page.
If you're using the Firefox browser, there are two particularly useful extensions that 
can be downloaded, installed, and used from within the browser. The first is the Web 
Developer extension, available from https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/. 
The Web Developer toolbar allows you to outline various elements on the page, 
such as table or block-level elements, see what CSS classes are applied to particular 
elements, and also see the definition of those classes. The Firebug extension, available 
from https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/, offers even more power, 
including an inspector to reveal the structure of the page and a JavaScript debugger. 
Installing Firefox extensions is a straightforward operation. 
For Internet Explorer 7, there is also a "Web Developer Toolbar", similar to both the 
Firefox Web Developer Toolbar and the Firebug extension. It can be downloaded from:
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-
672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en
There is also a similar toolbar for the Opera web browser, available from:
http://operawiki.info/WebDevToolbar
For the Safari web browser, you can try the Web Inspector available from:
http://webkit.org/blog/?p=41
One other thing to note: we'll be making changes to the files in our template, and 
then refreshing our browser pages to see the changes. If you find that refreshing the 
page in your browser isn't changing anything, you might want to perform a "hard" 
refresh (Ctrl + F5 in many browsers), which will ignore any items your browser 

Chapter 11
[ 243 ]
might have cached. Internet Explorer in particular often needs a hard refresh to take 
notice of a change in the stylesheet of your template.
Template File Structure
A "template" is a folder that contains a couple of files and two folders. First of all, 
the folders:
css: This folder contains the CSS stylesheet for the template. The stylesheet 
file is called template_css.css.
images: This folder contains the images that are used by the template. This 
can be background images, images for the site banner, and so on.
The files in the template folder are as follows:
templateDetails.xml: This is an XML file that contains the metadata about 
the template; the name of the template, the author, date it was created, and 
also a full list of the files in the css and images folders. 
template_thumbnail.png: This image is a "thumbnail" of the final template 
as it would be seen on the screen. This is the image that pops up when you 
hover the cursor over a template in the Template Manager. Typically, this 
image is around 200 pixels wide.
index.php: This is a PHP code file, and is actually the "template" itself. This 
file contains the HTML markup for the page, along with some inserts of PHP 
code that call Mambo functions to display modules and so on.
That doesn't seem so bad, just three files and some images in a template!
Creating a New Template
To get started, create a copy of the waterandstone_green folder and call it 
zaksprings. We're going to work with the green Water and Stone template, and 
gradually change it as we go. 
Changing the Template Details
The first step is to change the name of the template, so open up the file 
templateDetails.xml in a text editor, and change the name element as 
highlighted below:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<mosinstall type="template" version="4.5.3">
    <name>zaksprings</name>
•
•
•
•
•

Customizing a Template
[ 244 ]
After you've done this, save the file, and let's move on.
The templateDetails.xml file contains metadata for the template, which is used 
to identify it to the Template Manager in the Mambo administrator area, and also 
provide information that can be used by the Universal Installer when the template is 
installed. We'll talk more about this metadata at the end of the chapter when we've 
completed our new template.
Now if you browse to the Template Manager, you will see the zaksprings template 
in the list; select it, and set it is as the default template so that we'll be able to see how 
our changes look.
The Template File Itself
Although we are talking about "templates", the index.php file in our template 
folder can really by called the "template". You can open this file in your text editor to 
look at as we go further.
The file starts by preventing direct access to the template, and then declaring the 
document type of the page. The document type is XHTML, which is a "stricter and 
cleaner" flavor of HTML, intended to add a proper XML structure to HTML pages. 
You can read more about XHTML at: http://www.w3schools.com/xhtml/xhtml_
intro.asp.
<?php
  defined( '_VALID_MOS' ) or 
    die( 'Direct Access to this location is not allowed.' );
// needed to seperate the ISO number from the language 
  file constant _ISO
  $iso = explode( '=', _ISO );
// xml prolog
  echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="'. $iso[1] .'"?' .'>';
?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
The next part of the template sets up the <head> element of the page, which includes 
such things as the meta tags that Mambo will generate (these are included by the 
mosShowHead() PHP function), and some references to include the JavaScript 
required for the HTML editor and also the CSS stylesheet for the template from the 

Chapter 11
[ 245 ]
css folder of the template. If you wanted to add in references to other stylesheets or 
JavaScript libraries, you would do that in this part of the template:
<?php mosShowHead(); ?>
<?php
if ( $my->id ) {
   initEditor();
}
?>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" 
      content="text/html; <?php echo _ISO; ?>" />
<link href="<?php echo $mosConfig_live_site;?>
             /templates/waterandstone_green/css/template_css.css" 
      rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
</head>
As you continue to look through the file, you'll notice the presence of the word 
waterandstone_green in links to images and also the stylesheet. For example:
<link href="<?php echo $mosConfig_live_site;?>
             /templates/waterandstone_green/css/template_css.css"  
      rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
...
<a href="index.php">
   <img src="<?php echo $mosConfig_live_site; ?>
              /templates/waterandstone_green/images/logo.gif" 
        alt="logo image" border="0" align="top" />
</a>
These are references to our source template, so you will need to change this to 
point to your new template. If you don't, then you might wonder why nothing is 
happening when you start adding new graphics—it's because the wrong folder is 
being looked in for that new image!
Using the search and replace feature of your text editor replace all occurrences of 
waterandstone_green with zaksprings, and then save the file.
Quite a lot goes on in the index.php file, and display of the page only really starts 
with these lines:
<body class="waterbody">
<div align="center">
<div id="container">
   <div id="containerbg">

Customizing a Template
[ 246 ]
From then on, the file consists mostly of HTML container elements, and some PHP 
statements (as highlighted below):
             <!-- start left column. -->
             <div id="leftcol">
             <?php mosLoadModules('left'); ?>
             </div>
             <div id="leftcolmenu">
             <?php mosLoadModules('user1'); ?>
             </div>
             <!-- end left column. -->
The file also has a number of HTML comments (enclosed by <!-- -->), which help 
to give you an idea of what's going on. The snippet above displays the left‑hand 
column. An HTML div element is created, with an id attribute of leftcol. This id 
attribute will be used to identify that particular page element by the CSS stylesheet. 
What goes into this div element? The output of the mosLoadModules('left') 
function will be the value of div element. 
You can almost guess what mosLoadModules('left') does. It displays all the 
Mambo modules that have a position of left. 
Further down the file, you can see some other functions:
<?php
             if (mosCountModules('user2') >= 1 OR 
mosCountModules('user3') >= 1 ) {
             ?>
...
<?php mosPathWay(); ?>
...
<?php mosMainBody(); ?>
The name, of these functions gives a big clue to what they are expected to do. 
The mosCountModules() function returns the number of modules in a particular 
position. This function is used in case you wanted to enclose the modules in some 
kind of container element, but you only wanted the container element displayed if 
there were actually some modules to go in it. 
The mospathWay() function displays the breadcrumbs:
The main part of the page is displayed by mosMainBody().

Chapter 11
[ 247 ]
No Logic Here
One thing you will notice is that once the display of the page starts after the <body> 
tag in index.php, there is very little "logic" in the index.php file. There are only two 
if statements in the entire file and both of these only check if a particular module 
position has some modules. 
There is little point in putting logic into the template file. Through the module and 
menu management systems of Mambo's administration, you have already encoded 
a lot of logic on how your site will look and operate; displaying modules in certain 
positions on certain pages, restricting certain menu items to some types of user, and 
so on. Also, the ability to select a different template for different sets of pages adds 
another layer of logic, so there isn't that much left to put into the template. Also, 
you would need to have a very good knowledge of the inner workings of Mambo to 
introduce more complex logic into the page output. 
Links to Images
Another thing to note is the links to images in the file. They look like this:
<img src="<?php echo $mosConfig_live_site; ?>
           /templates/zaksprings/images/img_header.jpg" 
     alt="header image" />
The $mosConfig_live_site variable holds the path to your site (http://www.
zaksprings.com for example), which is added to the path to an image. The images 
for a template are found in its images folder, so you might be wondering why you 
would need a long path to get to that image, why not simply images/img_header.
jpg? That's because the browser is not requesting the file index.php in the templates 
folder. The page requests to Mambo always come through a few files in the root of 
the Mambo installation, index.php, index2.php, and so on. The index.php file of 
the template is "included" by Mambo for processing, so although the image looks like 
it's only one folder away from that index.php file, you need to write the full path 
to the image, which is templates/<name of template>/images for a visitor's web 
browser to get at an image.
No Layout Here
You may also be wondering where all the layout information in the template 
is. There doesn't really seem to be very much in the template in terms of HTML 
markup, just some <div> elements. That's because all the formatting is passed on to 
the CSS stylesheet. The tasks such as where these <div> elements go on the page, 
how big they are, what color they are, and what their text looks like are controlled by 
the CSS stylesheet. 

Customizing a Template
[ 248 ]
To get a better picture of the importance of the stylesheet, this image shows the basic 
Water and Stone template without the stylesheet applied. As you can see, it's not 
particularly good!
The stylesheet transforms this basic list of items into a web page.
XHTML Compliance
Before we go any further, it's worth reflecting on the idea that the page created by 
the template is XHTML rather than standard HTML, or put another way, the page 
is XHTML compliant. One of the obvious differences between XHTML and HTML 
is that tags need to be closed, in order to be valid XML. In HTML, you can get away 
with using tags like: 
Time for a line break<br>
and now a picture: <img src="images/myimage.gif">
However, to be valid XHTML, the <br> tag would need to be closed. This is not 
done with a </br> tag, but with /> characters at the end of the tag instead of the > 
character. The same is true for the <img> tag. Thus, to produce valid XHTML, we 
would want:

Chapter 11
[ 249 ]
 Time for a line break<br/>
and now a picture: <img src="images/myimage.gif"/>
This might seem like a lot of work to produce XHTML. Every time you used tags like 
these, you would want to make sure the tags are closed. However, if you think about 
it for a moment, you really won't have to do this that often.
There are three main ways that text finds it way onto your pages in Mambo
From the HTML editor
From code in Mambo components, modules, and so on
From the markup in the index.php file of the template
Whenever you add marked-up content in Mambo, you would generally find yourself 
using the HTML editor. When entering content through the HTML editor, if you've 
had a look at the HTML source as you're editing, you'll see that HTML editor itself 
ensures that the tags are XHTML compliant, <img> tags become <img/> and so on. 
If you work directly with the HTML source in the HTML editor, then you can try to 
introduce non-XHTML compliant markup, but even then, the HTML editor will do 
its best to make it XHTML compliant!
Mambo components produce their own output. It is up to the programmer of these 
components to make sure that the output is XHTML compliant, and generally, they 
do a good job of this.
The markup in the index.php file of the template looks like the only place you can 
really mess things up! This is one reason why the markup in the template looks 
simple; it basically consists of a number of <div> elements, and as we'll see, the 
formatting and layout of these elements is controlled by the CSS stylesheet. In 
addition to decoupling the layout of the page from the markup, this approach gives 
less opportunity for creating non XHTML-compliant markup as well.
So, keep an eye on the markup you add to the template, keep it XHTML compliant, 
and the rest of Mambo will keep things XHTML compliant as well. This is something 
to watch out for if you are editing the index.php file in some HTML editing 
application, such as FrontPage, which often has its own ideas about what kind of 
HTML it thinks you want to enter.
Customizing the Page Layout
We've seen the basics of what templateDetails.xml and index.php do. Now 
we're actually going to get started.

Customizing a Template
[ 250 ]
In this section we'll go through some basic changes to the page layout:
Replacing the Header Graphic
Moving the Top Menu
Changing the Page Background
Changing the Fonts
Changing the Main Content Area
Customizing the Read More Link
Changing the Background Color of the Columns
Adding the Bottom Menu
The first two will involve changes to index.php, after that, we're into the stylesheet!
Replacing the Header Graphic
We've got a rather nifty site banner for Zak Springs, and we want it to replace the 
existing two top images in the current template:
You'll find our new header graphic, img_header.jpg, in the code download for this 
chapter. Copy it to the images folder of our zaksprings template, and it will replace 
an existing file there. 
You'll have noticed that there are two graphics in the current "header", the logo at 
the top (logo.gif) and the image header below (img_header.jpg), with the top 
menu in between them. If we look in index.php, this is what we see. The top menu 
is highlighted in the code below:
          <!-- start logo -->
          <div id="logo">
           <a href="index.php">
             <img src="<?php echo $mosConfig_live_site; ?>
                        /templates/zaksprings/images/logo.gif"

                  alt="logo image" border="0" align="top" />
           </a>
          </div>
          <!-- end logo -->
          <!-- start top menu -->
          <div id="topmenu">
          <?php mosLoadModules('top',-1); ?>
          </div>
          <!-- end top menu.  -->
          <!-- start image header -->
          <div id="imgheader">
          <img src="templates/zaksprings/images/img_header.jpg" 
               alt="header image" />
          </div>
          <!-- end image header -->
We're going to do away with the logo part of the header, so we'll delete everything 
from <!-- start logo --> to <!-- end logo -->.
We don't need to change the link to the header image, since we replaced the existing 
graphic with one of the same name.
Save the file, and have a look at the front end of your site. You should see the new 
header graphic:
However, that doesn't look right; the main menu seems to have started too "high" 
on the page. There is no evidence for why this should have happened in the index.
php file, so the culprit must be in the stylesheet, that's the only other thing involved 
in the template. 
In your text editor, open the file template_css.css in the css folder. What are we 
looking for? Well, you may have noticed the <div> element containing the header 
graphic with an id of imgheader. In a CSS stylesheet, you can define a CSS class 

Customizing a Template
[ 252 ]
to apply to an HTML element with a particular id attribute by using the syntax # 
followed by the value of the id attribute. That means we're looking for something 
called #imgheader in our file, so using the find feature of your text editor, hunt 
down #imgheader. This is what you'll find:
/** div container for image header **/
#imgheader {
   position:relative;
   float:left;
   clear:left;
   width:100%;
   height:99px;
   background-color: #000000;
}
This is the style information—known as properties in CSS parlance—that we're 
after. If you're not familiar with properties in CSS, they consist of the property name 
followed by a colon, followed by the property definition, with a semi-colon denoting 
the end of the definition. 
Without being a master of CSS, you should suspect the height property could be the 
problem. It's definition says 99px, which sets the height of the imgheader element 
to 99 pixels. If you check out the img_header.jpg graphic, you'll find its 173 pixels 
high. It's pretty clear what we've to do—set the height to 173 pixels like this:
/** div container for image header **/
#imgheader {
   position:relative;
   float:left;
   clear:left;
   width:100%;
   height:173px;
   background-color: #000000;
}
Save the file, and refresh the page of your site, and the main menu should now start 
underneath the header graphic, rather than part way through it.
OK, we're off! Before we go any further, delete the file logo.gif from the images 
folder of the template as we don't need it anymore.

Chapter 11
[ 253 ]
Changing the Page Background and Fonts
The page background is our next stop. The Water and Stone template uses an odd 
gray, stripey background. We're going to replace that will a pure black background. 
In the index.php file, the body element looks like this:
<body class="waterbody">
There is no sign of a background setting there, so the answer lies again in the 
stylesheet. The definition for the CSS class waterbody looks like this. It is right at 
the top of the file:
.waterbody {
   background:#FFFFFF url(../images/bg_body.jpg) repeat-x left top;
   margin:0;
   color:#333333;
}
We don't want any background image, so delete everything on the background 
property line after #FFFFF, and then change #FFFFFF (which specifies white) to 
#000000 (black) to get this:
.waterbody {
   background:#000000 ;
   margin:0;
   color:#333333;
}
Make sure you've still got the semi-colon at the end of the line. The semi-colons 
denote the end of a CSS property definition.
Once you've done that, save the file and refresh your browser, and your page 
background will be black in color. 
While we're here, let's change the body fonts. The definition at the top of the 
stylesheet handles the body fonts:
* {
   font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
This specifies a default font of Arial, followed by Helvetica if Arial isn't available, 
or some general sans-serif font if that one isn't available. We're going to change this 
to make Verdana the default font. If that isn't available, then this visitor will have to 
make do with Arial.
* {
   font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

Customizing a Template
[ 254 ]
Changing the Main Content Area
We're going well now, so let's look at the main content area.
In index.php, you can find the main content area of the page, and see it is wrapped 
in a div element with an id of content_main:
<!-- start main body -->
             <div id="content_main">
...
                     <?php mosMainBody(); ?>
...
             </div>
             <!-- end main body -->
This suggests our next target is the content_main class in the stylesheet. Search for 
it, and you'll find this:
/** div container for mainbody **/
#content_main {
   position:relative;
   float:left;
   width:520px;
   margin:15px 0 20px 20px;
   background-color:#FFFFFF;
}
The interesting things to note here are the width property, which specifies a width of 
520 pixels. Also, the margin is set by the margin property. The margin is the spacing 
"outside" of an element, which means between an element and its parent. We're 
going to bring the main content area much closer to the header graphic, and put a 
gray border around it. We will also add some internal spacing with the padding 
property. We'll add eight pixels of padding on all sides. Change the definition for 
content_main to the following:
/** div container for mainbody **/
#content_main {
   position:relative;
   float:left;
   width:520px;
   margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px;
   background-color:#FFFFFF;
   padding:8px;
   border:2px #CCCCCC solid;
}

Chapter 11
[ 255 ]
Note how we have set the margin. There are 4 numbers, and these correspond to 
the top, right, bottom, and left margins respectively. Thus we have moved the main 
content area closer up to the header graphic, and closer to the left-hand side.
Changing the Background Color of the 
Columns
Let's look at the background color of the left and right-hand columns of the page. 
We want to change the left-hand column to black, and the right-hand column to a 
gray color.
Looking in index.php gives us a clue where to start looking for the left-hand column:
<div id="container_inner">
  <!-- start left column. -->
    <div id="leftcol">
We need to look for the leftcol class in the stylesheet. Here we'll find something 
surprising. First of all, we'll find lots of definitions for leftcol. In fact, you will find 
lots of definitions for styles used "inside" leftcol. 
If you keep looking, you'll not find a background for leftcol. The background 
actually belongs to a parent element, containerbg.
It is quite instructive to have a look at the page structure using the Inspector feature 
of the Firefox extension Firebug (this was one of the browser tools we discussed at 
the start of the chapter). If you don't have Firebug installed, you can still follow along 
the text. Open Firebug, click the Inspector tab and expand the body element, then 
expand the container element you find inside it. This is how the page structure 
looks in Firebug:

Customizing a Template
[ 256 ]
In the container element there are two other elements, containerbg and copyright. 
If you expand the copyright element you will find it doesn't really have much in it, 
only the copyright message. Everything goes on in the containerbg element. 
When you expand the containerbg element, you see this:
The outerleft element looks like it contains much of the page—the top menu, the 
image header, and the container_inner element, which has the left column and the 
content_main element.
Thus containerbg is our first stop to look for a background, after all, that could be 
what the bg stands for? This element does indeed have a background in the stylesheet:
#containerbg {
   position:relative;
   width: 900px;
   background:transparent url(../images/bg_inside.jpg) repeat-y left 
    top;
   float:left;
   top:0;
   left:0;
The path to the background image is defined by this part of the background property:
url(../images/bg_inside.jpg)
This path is relative to the stylesheet, unlike the path to images used from index.php 
we saw earlier, which are relative to the root of our Mambo installation (like 
/templates/zaksprings/images/logo.gif for example). 
To get away from the stylesheet (in zaksprings/css/template_css.css) you have 
to go up a folder (../) bringing you to the zaksprings folder, and then into the 
images folder. Specifying background images using CSS in this way means that you 
bypass the need for including the name of the template.

Chapter 11
[ 257 ]
The bg_inside.jpg image itself is interesting. It has three parts, a green bit on the 
left, a white bit in the middle, and a darker green bit on the right-hand end.
Here is a representation of it:
This graphic defines the entire background for the containerbg element, including 
the right-hand column. The white bit in the middle defines a white background for 
the main content area, and the dark green on the right-hand side is for the right-
hand column. One of the reasons to define the background for the columns in this 
way is that then the background will reach all the way to the bottom of the entire 
container element.
If you set a background for the right-hand column, it would only extend as far as the 
right-hand column reached. Sometimes the right-hand column may have less content 
in it than the left-hand column, and you would find that the background of your 
right-hand column just stopped part of the way down the page, because the element 
it was the background for had stopped.
We could change the background color of the left-hand column by simply changing 
the color of the left-hand part of the bg_inside.jpg in a graphics editor, using a 
flood fill or some careful brush work. What we'll do is to make the left-hand part of 
the image completely black, and then fill in the white middle part black as well. The 
right-hand side will be made a gray color (HTML code #363636).
You can find the changed version of bg_inside.jpg in the code download. Copy 
it to the images folder and when you refresh your page, you'll see how things 
have changed:

Customizing a Template
[ 258 ]
Customizing the Read More Link
The Read More... link displayed under the introduction of a content item is our next 
target. If you use the Information | Display ID and Class Details option of the 
Firefox developer toolbar, or just have a careful look at the HTML source of the page 
(search for Read more) you'll see the name of the CSS class we want is readon:
<a href="http://localhost/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;
task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=9" class="readon">
                 Read more...              </a>
The current format of this link is pretty basic. We're going to produce something a bit 
more impressive:
The Read more... link will "float" on the right, resemble a button with a nice gradient 
background, and when the user hovers their mouse cursor over the link, the 
background will change. This will not need any JavaScript.
Let's have a look at the readon class in the stylesheet:
/*** read more link ***/
.readon,
a.readon:link,
a.readon:active,
a.readon:visited {
   color:#666666;
   font-weight:bold;
   text-align:left;
   margin-top:10px;
   letter-spacing: 2px;
   font-size:10px;
   text-decoration:none;
}
We will add properties for the background image, some padding to keep some 
space between the text of the link and the border, and a gray border. Note that we 
use the background-image property to specify the background image rather than 
the background property as we have seen earlier. Using background allows you to 
specify a background color as well.

Chapter 11
[ 259 ]
/*** read more link ***/
.readon,
a.readon:link,
a.readon:active,
a.readon:visited {
   color:#666666;
   font-weight:bold;
   text-align:left;
   margin-top:10px;
   letter-spacing: 2px;
   font-size:10px;
   text-decoration:none;
   float:right;
   background-image: url(../images/readon.png);
   padding:4px;
   border:2px #CCCCCC solid;
}
The float property allows the element to be shifted to either the left or right on 
its current line. Our element will float to the right of the current line. (Again you 
will find the readon.png image in the code download. Copy it to the images folder 
of zaksprings.)
The standard readon link is defined by a.readon:link, and a.readon:visited can 
be used to define the formatting for a link that has been visited. The behavior of a 
link as you click on it is determined by a.readon:active. There is another behavior 
whose formatting can be defined, the behavior when you hover your mouse cursor 
over an element. This is defined by <classname>:hover.
Looking through the rest of the file you find the extra a.readon:hover definition.
/** underline on hover **/
a.toclink:hover,
...
a.readon:hover,
...
a.latestnews:hover {
   text-decoration:underline;
   color:#0C362D;
   background-color:inherit;
}
This definition sets what happens when a user hovers their mouse cursor over these 
links. The color changes and the link is underlined. This is fine, but we want more, so 
let's add to the a.readon:hover definition:

Customizing a Template
[ 260 ]
/** underline on hover **/
a.toclink:hover,
...
a.readon:hover,
...
a.latestnews:hover {
   text-decoration:underline;
   color:#0C362D;
   background-color:inherit;
}
a.readon:hover { background-image: url(../images/readon_hover.png) }
We've left the first a.readon:hover defintion for the underlining. The second 
definition will add the background-image in addition to the properties from the first 
definition. This means that when the visitor hovers the cursor over the link, a new 
background image will be displayed.
Formatting the Content Items
Our customization of the Read More... link was our first encounter with CSS classes 
that do not come from the template itself. Things such as waterbody, content_main, 
and so on are mentioned in the index.php file of the template, they do not come 
from the Mambo "core" or the output of any component. The readon CSS class is 
produced from a Mambo component. We'll have a look at some more CSS classes 
that come straight from the Content component. For any template you want to 
create, you would have to define these styles.
This image shows a content item from the front page, and the classes that style 
various parts of it:

Chapter 11
[ 261 ]
Whenever Mambo displays a content item, the Content component will spit out 
the same kind of output, with the different parts of the content item marked with 
various CSS classes. Whatever the content of the item, the classes will always be 
the same, and there is no real way to control this from the template, since these are 
"hardcoded" into the Content component.
First of all, this display is made up of two tables, both of class contentpaneopen. 
The title of the content item is in one table, and everything below Written by 
Administrator is in another table. The title of the content item is styled by the 
contentheading class.
The Written By Administrator text is in the small class, and the date is marked by 
the createdate class. The text of the item is in the default style of the page, and the 
Write Comment and Read more... links are both in the same style, readon. 
For now, we're quite happy with the way the content items are formatted. In the 
following sections, we will point out which CSS classes come from the base template, 
and which are from the Mambo core or a component.
Adding the Bottom Menu
We began creating a menu to go at the bottom of the page in Chapter 6. At that 
time, we couldn't actually place it where we wanted, because of the template. We'll 
rectify that now by adding some code to the index.php file to display the modules 
in that position.
We set the position of the bottom menu to bottom, which conveniently existed. If 
we wanted to create a new module position, we can do that from Site | Template 
Manager | Module Positions of the administrator menu. All we would need to do is 
give our new module position a name and save it.
Adding the code to load the modules from the bottom position is easy. We add it 
near the end of the index.php file:
</div>
</div>
<div align="center">
   <div id="bottommenu" >
      <?php mosLoadModules('bottom'); ?>
   </div>
</div>
<?php mosLoadModules('debug', -1);?>
</body>
</html>

Customizing a Template
[ 262 ]
We wrap the div containing the bottom menu in another div, and align it to the 
center of the page. However, if you view the menu now it will look odd. That's 
because it will be styled like one of the side menus. To get a properly styled menu, 
we need to use the Menu Class Suffix property of the bottom menu's module 
parameters. This will add something onto the name of the class used by the bottom 
menu to produce a unique classname for the menu.
First of all, before we make any changes to the stylesheet, edit the Bottom Menu 
module from Modules | Site Modules on the administrator menu. In the module 
Parameters, set its Menu Class Suffix to -navbot and its Menu Style as Horizontal, 
and then click Save.
Now we add the definition for the bottommenu element to the stylesheet:
#bottommenu {
   width:350px;
   text-align:center;
   margin-bottom:32px;
}
Next we define the style for links in the bottom menu. The Menu Class Suffix of 
–navbot means that instead of a.mainlevel being the class for the link, the 
classname will be a.mainlevel-navbot. 
#bottommenu a.mainlevel-navbot { margin:24px; color:#ffffff;}
You can get a little illustration of the difficulty of producing cross-browser templates 
here. If you omit the #bottommenu part of the definition for the link, Internet 
Explorer won't set the color of the link to white, while it looks OK in Firefox for 
example. One of the reasons for working with the Water and Stone templates from 
the start is that they display pretty well across different browsers, so we'll try to keep 
this up.
That completes the bottom menu.

Chapter 11
[ 263 ]
Customizing the Modules
Now we turn our attention to the module output. We'll start by spacing out the 
modules; you'll have noticed that as soon as one finishes, the next module starts 
almost immediately. We'd like a bit of breathing room between them.
Spacing Out the Modules
Let's use Firebug's Inspector again to have a look at the leftcol element, which 
contains our left-hand modules:
Expanding the leftcol element shows a number of table elements, with CSS 
class moduletable. That sounds like what we're after. If we expand one of the 
moduletable elements:
You can see that the th element of the table holds the module title.

Customizing a Template
[ 264 ]
One thing to note is that there is no mention of moduletable in the index.php file 
of the template. This is another CSS class that comes from the Mambo core, and does 
not depend on the template. 
A search through the stylesheet reveals no definition for moduletable. There are 
definitions for the td and th moduletable elements, but these only define part of the 
table. We'll modify the th definition in a moment.
We'll add a moduletable defintion into the stylesheet that will apply to modules in 
the left-hand column:
#leftcol table.moduletable { 
   margin-bottom:8px;
   border-top:1px #CCCCCC solid;
   border-bottom:1px #CCCCCC solid;
   background:url(../images/bg_lhm_inside.jpg) 
   repeat-y left top;
}
The #leftcol indicates that this definition will apply to the element with id 
leftcol, which is the container for the left-hand modules. (This is specified in the 
index.php file).
The margin-bottom property sets the spacing after the table. One reason to set the 
spacing after (rather than before using margin-top), is so that the top module can 
still be right under the header graphic. If we had margin-top, there would be a gap 
before the first module is displayed.
We set a border for the top and bottom (we will handle the side margin in a 
moment), and define a background image. (The image is again in the code download 
and needs to be copied to the images folder of zaksprings.)
The background image is 170px wide, which is the exact width of the left-hand 
column. The role of the background image is to provide the side border. The 
background-image looks like this:
The gray lines are the borders of the module. The repeat-y part of the property 
definition ensures that the image will repeat vertically rather than horizontally, since 
the image is really only a couple of pixels high.

Chapter 11
[ 265 ]
This image is actually constructed from cropping the original bg_inside.jpg 
background image, and changing the colors, in the same way the current version of 
bg_inside.jpg was prepared.
Once you've made these changes, save the stylesheet and refresh your browser page. 
This is what the Other Menu looks like:
We're still not finished here, there is something not quite right with the module title.
Changing the Module Headers
To change the way the module titles look, we need to investigate the moduletable 
th definition.
In the stylesheet, you'll find the definition for the table headings:
#leftcol table.moduletable th {
   background-color: #8F8A2C;
   color: #000000;
   border: solid 1px #000000;
}
#rightcol table.moduletable th {
   background-color:#6EB28A;
   border: solid 1px #000000;
}
These define the table headings for left-hand and right-hand modules. The 
#leftcol refers to the left-hand column element and #rightcol refers to the 
right-hand column element.

Customizing a Template
[ 266 ]
Let's take a closer look at the current module title bar:
We would like to change the background color to a nice silvery gray, but it looks 
like we will also want to add a border above and below to match the gray of the side 
borders. This is our new definition:
#leftcol table.moduletable th {
   color: #000000;
   background: url(../images/moduletableth.jpg) repeat-y left top;
   border-top:1px #808080 solid;
   border-bottom:1px #808080 solid;
}
The top and bottom borders are easy enough. The color of the borders (#808080) 
matches up with the gray borders. It's our background image that's the interesting bit. 
This image is similar to the background for the module table. Its 170 pixels wide, but 
it has a silvery gray background, with darker gray side borders to match the border 
with the rest of the module table:
However, if you look at your Mambo page now, there is still something not right 
about the module titles. Even with the new background image, it still doesn't 
look quite aligned properly. Something is interfering. The culprit is the general 
moduletable th definition:
/** general module title **/
table.moduletable th {
   border: solid 1px #000000;
   color:#FFFFFF;
It's that one pixel border that's throwing everything out. Let's comment out that line 
with the /* and */.characters:
/** general module title **/
table.moduletable th {
   /* border: solid 1px #000000; */
   color:#FFFFFF;

Chapter 11
[ 267 ]
Now save the file. When you view your page, the module titles look pretty good.
Customizing the Menus
We'll complete our customization by changing some of the properties of the menu 
entries. We'll first of all change the color of the menu entry when the mouse cursor 
is hovered over it, then we'll change the border of an menu entry to fit it in with our 
gray color scheme for the side borders, then we'll add a new definition to highlight 
the currently selected menu item.
All the CSS classes we encounter in this section come from the Mambo core. Their 
names do not depend on the choice of template, and for any new template you were 
creating, the class names you meet in this section will be ones you want to define in 
the template.
Changing the Menu Hover Color
Currently, when you hover the cursor over an entry in the main menu, the 
background color changes to green. We want to make this into a gray color, and also 
do something about the border between two menu entries. All we have to do is work 
out the name of the classes for the menu entries!
You can use the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar to display the ID and class 
information for a page (from Information | Display Id and Class Details). You 
would see something like this on your page: 

Customizing a Template
[ 268 ]
This shows the class for a menu entry is called mainlevel. We're interested in 
setting what happens when a visitor hovers their mouse cursor over one of the menu 
entries, so we're looking for mainlevel:hover in the CSS file. If you search for this, 
you'll come upon its definition:
/** generic menu item link on mouseover **/
a.mainlevel:hover,
#leftcol a.mainlevel:hover,
#leftcolmenu a.mainlevel:hover {
   background-color:#B8B35C;
   color:#000000!important;
   text-decoration:none!important;
} 
We'll change the background-color property to our new color, #6e6e6e, a 
gray color:
/** generic menu item link on mouseover **/
a.mainlevel:hover,
#leftcol a.mainlevel:hover,
#leftcolmenu a.mainlevel:hover {
   background-color:#6e6e6e;
   color:#000000!important;
   text-decoration:none!important;
}
Changing the Menu Item Borders
Let's look at the definition in the stylesheet for a typical menu entry, which is 
called mainlevel:
/** generic menu item **/
.mainlevel  {
   display:block;
   font: bold 11px/25px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;
   padding-left:15px;
   background:transparent url(../images/bg_mainlevel.gif) 
               repeat-x center top;
   font-weight:bold;
   text-decoration:none;
}

Chapter 11
[ 269 ]
From this, we see no mention of a border, so the border must be provided by the 
background image. The background image is only 10 pixels wide, and 2 pixels high, 
with the top row of pixels in the image a dark green color, the bottom a lighter green. 
We will replace this background image with a simple dotted, gray border (#808080)�:
/** generic menu item **/
.mainlevel  {
   display:block;
   font: bold 11px/25px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;
   padding-left:15px;
   border-top:2px ��������do���d�
#808080 dotted�;
   font-weight:bold;
   text-decoration:none;
}
Highlighting the Current Menu Item 
When you view a page in Mambo, the Itemid in the query string of the URL 
indicates the menu item corresponding to this page. That means you should be able 
to highlight the currently chosen menu entry. The currently selected menu entry is 
marked with an id of active_menu in the page. If you click the Home link on the 
main menu for example, and have a look in the HTML source of the page, you will 
see this markup:
<a href="http://.../index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1" 
   class="mainlevel"
   id="active_menu">
Home</a>
However, the CSS class for this is missing from the base Water and Stone templates, 
so we will need to add it ourselves.
We'll set the background for the currently selected menu item to a dark greeny 
color. We will also add some margin on the left and right, so that this background 
color does not overwrite the side border of the menu item, which is provided by 
the background image for containerbg if you recall. This is our definition for 
active_menu that we add into the CSS file:
#active_menu {
   background: #527428;
   margin-left:2px;
   margin-right:2px;
}

Customizing a Template
[ 270 ]
The use of the # character is because the class is applied to the element with id 
attribute of active_menu.
A good place to add this definition is just before this part of the file, to keep it with 
the other menu definitions:
/* ---------------------
mambo module layout
--------------------- */
Finishing Off
There are two more steps before we have a "packageable" template. We 
need to create the template thumbnail, and then complete the metadata in 
templateDetails.xml.
The template thumbnail is easy enough. View the page in your browser, take 
a screenshot (Ctrl + Alt + Print Screen on Windows copies the current screen to 
your clipboard), and you can paste it into your graphics editor. Crop the image to 
make sure that it's only got the output of the web page, and not the entire browser 
window, then resize the image to 200 pixels wide. In most graphics editors, when 
you resize an image by specifying the width, the height is automatically calculated 
based on the original ratio of the width to the height. Once the image is resized, save 
it as a PNG file called template_thumbnail.png in the zaksprings folder. The next 
time you hover your mouse cursor over the template in the Template Manager, this 
new thumbnail should pop up.
We also need to complete the rest of the metadata in the templateDetails.xml file. 
First of all, there is the general information about the template, its description, and 
its authoring:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<mosinstall type="template" version="4.5.3">
   �����������������������
<����������������������
name>zaksprings</name>

   <authorUrl>http://www.packtpub.com</authorUrl>
   <version>1.0</version>
   <description>The Template for Zak Springs Golf Club</description>
Underneath this is part of the metadata where you need to list all the files that would 
be included in the template, all the CSS files (we've used only one), and all the 
images, or any other files that go in the images folder:

</images>
<css>
  <filename>css/template_css.css</filename>
</css>
It is important that you list of all the files in the folders; the reason for doing so is 
explained in the following part.
Creating a Template Package
We've currently got two Mambo installations on our local development machines 
(the one with the sample data and the Zak Springs site), so let's test out the template 
on the other installation. Rather than simply copying the zaksprings folder from 
one installation to the other, let's create an installable template, which can then be 
installed on the other site from its Universal Installer.

Customizing a Template
[ 272 ]
To create the installable template, simply ZIP up the zaksprings folder in to a ZIP 
archive. Make sure you ZIP up the folder, not just the contents of the folder. (For 
example, on Windows, right-click on the folder, select Send To from the pop-up 
context menu, then choose Compressed (zipped) folder.) 
Now you can log in to the administration area of your other installation, go to the 
Universal Installer, and install the new template in the same way you have installed 
components and modules earlier in the book. 
The importance of specifying all the files in the templateDetails.
xml file may reveal itself when you attempt to install the new 
template. During installation, only the files listed in the <files> 
or <images> section of the templateDetails.xml file will 
copied from the ZIP file and placed into the template folder on 
the destination server. Although you might have all the images 
in the ZIP file, if they're not listed in the <images> section of the 
templateDetails.xml file, you won't find them in your newly 
installed template.
Summary
In this chapter we walked through some basic customizations to one of the standard 
Water and Stone templates that ship with Mambo. 
We began with a discussion of the template file structure, the templateDetails.xml 
file that contains the metadata for the template, and had a look at the index.php file 
in the template folder. We saw that Mambo produces XHTML-compliant pages.
We began our customization by first changing the header graphic for the page, then 
the page background, and then the main content area. This introduced us to the 
template stylesheet file.
We also made some customization to module display, increasing the spacing 
between modules, and creating a new title bar for them. We made some further 
changes to the menus on the page, including highlighting the currently selected 
menu item.
We finished off by creating the template thumbnail, and completing the 
templateDetails.xml file to allow the template to be installed onto another 
Mambo site.

Deploying and Running 
Your Site
In this chapter, we will walk through the steps to deploy a Mambo installation onto a 
remote web server, and set the permissions to allow it function properly.
We will begin by talking about how to upload the standard Mambo installation, and 
then supplement this with a site that you may have developed locally. After that, 
we'll see about uploading the local database to your remote site, and finally updating 
the remote configuration so that all the tweaking to your local site is preserved on 
the remote server.
Overview of the Process
Our process will be this:
Upload the files for our local Mambo installation via FTP
Upload the installation folder from the original set of Mambo files 
via FTP
Get an empty database ready for Mambo
Use the web installer to get a basic Mambo site working
Restore the database from our local installation onto the remote server
The reason for this process, which would seem to involve an extra step of creating 
a fresh installation and "not using it", is that the fresh installation of Mambo on the 
remote server allows us to access the administration area, from where we can easily 
restore the local database, which has all our site data. If we didn't have this fresh 
Mambo installation, we'd have no Mambo database, and we've have to start poking 
around on our remote server to restore the database using a tool like phpMyAdmin.

Checking Server Requirements
In this chapter, we are assuming that your remote server supports Apache, MySQL, 
and PHP. The main difference to look for between your local machine and the 
remote server is the PHP configuration settings and available extensions. To run 
properly, Mambo does not require any particular PHP configuration settings to be 
made, but this could be one area to look into if things aren't behaving as expected.
Mambo makes use of the ZLIB PHP extension, which allows PHP to handle ZIP 
archives. This is used by Mambo during its Universal Installer process, and you will 
have to check that the server is configured for this. If your server does not support the 
ZLIB library, then you can still install extensions; we'll tackle this later in the chapter. 
The first page of the web installer will tell you if the server is able to support this.
The "captcha" feature for displaying graphical text to prevent automatic comment 
posting makes use of some PHP graphic functions that require the GD extension. 
You can check for both these extensions by using the phpinfo() function. Create a 
file called phpinfo.php on your remote server, and add these lines:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
When you view this page on your browser, scroll down the long list of information, 
and you should see both the details of the GD extension, and further down, the ZLIB 
extension. If you see something like this for the GD extension, it will work fine:
In this chapter, we are assuming that your remote server is running one of the 
various UNIX operating systems: Linux, or FreeBSD for example. These operating 
systems for the server, along with Apache, MySQL, and PHP, are probably the most 
popular setups for web-hosting services.

Chapter 12
[ 275 ]
File System Permissions
File system ��������������������������������������������������������������������
permissions determine what can be done to a filer or folder, and by 
whom. "Whom" does not mean a person here, it means a machine user account. File 
system permissions are a typical stumbling block for many people working with 
Linux — if something isn't working, it's probably a permission problem!
The reason we are talking about them now is that Mambo often needs to write things 
to files within its installation. For example, the configuration data is written to the file 
configuration.php when changes are made. When an extension is installed, folders 
are created, and new files are copied into those folders. The problem is that you don't 
really want to allow Mambo to be able write to any file in its installation all the time. 
When we say "Mambo writing to a file", this actually means "any PHP script on the 
server writing to a file".
The problem isn't the normal operation of Mambo. The problem is that some security 
vulnerability could arise that could allow some unknown script to be written to your 
installation. This script could act in a completely malicious way; corrupting files in 
your installation (since everything would be writable) or grabbing user data and 
sending it off to some other location on the Internet for some unspeakable purpose. 
In other words, we need to allow Mambo write access to certain folders from time 
to time, but we want to be careful with this. Fortunately, most of the file writing is 
done only for certain administrative operations that do not take place that often. 
Mambo can attempt to modify the file system permissions itself, but depending 
on the configuration of your web-hosting account, the server may not permit these 
operations, so you will need to make permission changes yourself.
A full discussion of Linux file permissions is beyond the scope of this chapter; but in 
essence the permissions for a file or folder will be represented by three digits:
The first digit specifies what the owner of the file or directory can do.
The second digit specifies what the owner's group can do.
The third digit specifies what everyone who isn't in the group can do.
For a detailed explanation of the Linux file permissions, you can have a look at the 
following URL:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Permissions#Octal_notation
To allow Mambo to write to files within a particular folder, the permissions for that 
folder need to be set to 777. If there is no need to write to the files in the folder, then 
the folder permissions should be set to 755. This will allow PHP scripts to be run 
within the folder.
•

•

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 276 ]
On your remote server, you will have some form of "control panel" (similar to 
Mambo's administration area), that allows you to configure various things on your 
server, including the file and folder permissions. There are a number of such "control 
panel" tools, (cPanel is one of the most popular ones), and you will be able to see the 
file and folder permissions something like this:
In this image, the right-hand column shows the file or folder permissions. Here 
we see that the administrator and cache folders can be written to (777), but the 
components folder cannot, although PHP scripts can be run from it (755). From your 
control panel, you will be able to set new values for the permissions.
If you have the ability to connect to the remote server via a secure shell, then setting 
the permissions can be done with the chmod command.
For example, to set the permissions of the configuration.php file to allow everyone 
to read, write, and execute, you would do this:
$ chmod 777 configuration.php
Or you can set the permissions of folders, and everything within by using the 
recursive flag, –r. The next command sets the permissions of the images and 
components folders, and their contents, to 777:
$ chmod -r 777 images components
Uploading the Mambo Code via FTP
Deploying your site begins by uploading the Mambo files with an FTP client to your 
web server. You will of course need an FTP account on your remote server for this, 
which you will likely be able to set up from your server "control panel".
There are lot of files in the standard Mambo installation, over 600 in the 
administrator folder, 130 in the includes folder, and close to 200 in the templates 
folder. Unless you want to choose from all the templates included with the standard 
installation, you do not have to upload these to the web server.

Chapter 12
[ 277 ]
If you don't have an FTP client, you can download the excellent CoreFTP from 
www.coreftp.com, or FileZilla from http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/.
On our local machine, our Mambo installations were of the form 
http://localhost/mambo, the files living in a folder called mambo in the 
document root of our local web server installation.
If you upload the mambo folder to your remote server, then your site will have a URL 
of the form http://<yoursite.com>/mambo, which may not be what you want; you 
may want the site to simply be of the form http://<yoursite.com>/. This means 
that you will have to upload the contents of the mambo folder on the local machine 
into the document root of your remote server, which will be called something like 
public_html or htdocs.
To begin our deployment process, upload the files from our local Mambo installation 
onto your remote server.

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 278 ]
If you still have a copy of the installation folder in your local Mambo installation (if 
you do, you must have renamed it!), then make sure that is uploaded as well, and once 
its uploaded, rename it back to installation. If you deleted the installation folder 
from your local Mambo installation, then grab a copy of that folder from your original 
download of the Mambo files, and upload it to your remote server.
Once everything is uploaded, and the files are copied to your web root (on some 
servers the location of uploaded FTP files and the document root of the web server 
are often different), you can enter the URL of your site into your browser, and you'll 
be met with the web installer welcome. This time, you will probably see that all the 
file permissions show as Unwriteable.
For now, this isn't too much of a problem. You don't have to worry about these 
folders being unwriteable to install Mambo. It will install quite happily with these 
folders unwriteable.
Setting Permissions for configuration.php
The problem here is setting the permissions of the configuration.php file into 
which the configuration settings will be written. It's a problem because the file 
doesn't exist!
There are two ways to solve this problem. The first is to create a file called 
configuration.php in your remote Mambo installation, and set its permissions 
to 777. You don't need to put anything in this file at the moment; its about to be 
replaced during the installation process.
If your remote Mambo installation is inside a folder in your document root, 
rather than sitting directly in the document root, you can set the permissions for 
this containing folder to 777 before beginning the installation process. After the 
installation process, remember to reset the permissions of the containing folder to 755.� 
Creating the Database
On our local installation, we used a MySQL account that had permssions to create 
databases, the root MySQL account. On your server, you may not be quite so 
fortunate, and may not have direct access to an account with such power.
Instead, you may have to work with your web server's control panel to create the 
database. Possibly your web hosting account can't actually create databases, and 
instead, your account comes set up with a number of databases that you will have to 
choose from for your Mambo database.

Chapter 12
[ 279 ]
Once you have a blank database for Mambo selected, and have chosen a database 
user that has permissions to create tables in this database, you are ready to begin the 
installation process. Don't forget to make a note the details of the database and the 
database user, since you will need them in the web installer.
Running the Web Installer
Once you've set the permissions for the folder containing your Mambo installation, 
and created (or chosen) the database and the MySQL user account to go with it, 
you are ready to run the web installer. Step through the pages, filling in the details, 
making sure that you pick a password different from admin for the admin account! 
You don't need to worry about the sample data on this site, we're about to replace 
the database completely.
Once the web installer has finished, remove the installation folder from your 
Mambo installation, and the front end of the site can be seen, and also, you can log 
into the administration area.
Migrating the Locally Created Database
Our next step is to move the data from your local site onto your Mambo server 
installation.
We begin by making a backup of the local database we want to migrate. 
Backing Up the Database
Backing up your database can be done from the Backup Database option of the 
Components | MOStlyDBAdmin DB Tools menu. This component comes with the 
standard Mambo installation, but not Mambo Lite, and it would need to installed 
separately if you are using Mambo Lite.
You select what you want done with the backup; whether it should be displayed on 
the screen, downloaded to your browser so you can save it locally, or saved directly 
onto the server. You can also choose the format of the backup, a ZIP file or a text file 
for example, and even choose to back up only certain tables. The default choice is to 
back up all the tables in the Mambo database.

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 280 ]
Click the Backup the Selected Tables option, and your backup will be created. A 
message like the following will greet you, which shows the filename of the backup 
file just created:
Database backup successful!Your file was saved on the server in 
directory :
.../administrator/backups/mambo466rc2_20082006184554.sql
Restoring the Database to the Remote Server
Grab a copy of the database you just backed up (you'll find it in the backups folder 
in the administration folder of your local testing machine). Before restoring a 
database to the remote server, it is probably worth switching the site off (from the 
Site tab of the Global Configuration), just in case there is some problem.
Restoring a copy of your database can be done from the Restore Database option of 
the Components | MOStlyDB Admin DB Tools menu. You will be presented with 
a list of any backups stored in the backups folder on the remote server.

Chapter 12
[ 281 ]
There is no need to upload a backup to your remote site by FTP; you can upload from 
this screen by clicking the Browse button and selecting the database backup file.
Before we can get this all to work, we need to make another file 
system permission change. When the database backup is uploaded 
to the remove server, Mambo copies it into the uploadfiles folder 
in the root of your Mambo installation, so that folder will need its 
permissions set to 777 before you attempt to restore the database. 
Once you've restored the database, you can change the permissions 
back to 644 to secure it from writing.
Once the file has uploaded, click Perform the Restore, and the information in 
the database backup is processed and the database restored. Success will bring a 
message like this:
Replacing the Site Configuration
If you spent a long time configuring your local site, and want your remote site to 
be configured in the same way, you can simply replace configuration.php on the 
remote server with configuration.php from your local machine.
However, there are a couple of things that will probably need to be changed from the 
local configuration.php file. For your remote configuration file, you will want to 
make sure you've got the correct database settings from your remote configuration, 
and also the path to the installation and the URL of the live site. These are the main 
lines in the configuration.php file that need attention:

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 282 ]
$mosConfig_host = 'localhost';
$mosConfig_user = 'mamboer';
$mosConfig_password = 'mamb071Passv0rd';
$mosConfig_db = 'mambo';
$mosConfig_dbprefix = 'mos_';
$mosConfig_absolute_path = 'C:/apachefriends/xampp/htdocs/mambo/';
$mosConfig_live_site = 'http://<YOURSITE>/mambo';
After that, you will want to make sure anything that refers to a "path" or a URL is 
pointing to the remote server rather than your machine. For example, the cache path 
will need to be updated before you upload the local configuration.php file:
$mosConfig_cachepath = 'C:/apachefriends/xampp/htdocs/mambo/cache';
It's easiest to make these changes to a copy of the local configuration.php file 
before you upload it to the remote server, because you can copy the information 
directly from the remote file and include it in the local copy. This is another benefit 
of following the process of creating a fresh installation on the remote server; we 
don't have to look around for the details to connect to the database, or work out 
the paths on the remote server, we can just take the details straight from the remote 
configuration.php file!
Once you've made your changes, upload the modified local configuration file ��������
to your 
remote server, and your new site is ready for action!
Resetting the Permissions of Your 
Installation
At this point, its probably worth resetting the permissions of the folder containing 
your Mambo installation on the remote server back to 755, but then setting the 
permissions of the configuration.php file itself to 777 (since changing the 
permissions on the folder will likely change the permissions of the files in the folder). 
This means that you will be able to write configuration changes. Rather than leaving 
the entire Mambo installation with the 777 permissions, we'll just set the permissions 
of this single file. In general, you do not want all of the files in your installation to be 
writeable by anyone, since this opens a possible security hole.
Although Mambo makes an attempt to change the permissions of various files and 
folders, it is likely that your server will not permit these operations (except possibly to 
lower the permissions — 777 to 755 for example, but then it can't change it back!), and 
you will have to work with your server control panel to change permissions yourself.

Chapter 12
[ 283 ]
During its normal running Mambo does not perform a lot of writing to the files and 
folders in the installation. It is only really when installing new extensions, or making 
configuration changes, that Mambo needs access to the file system. We'll talk about 
these permission settings in a moment.
Rename the Super Administrator Account
Since anyone attempting to infiltrate your site only has to put /administrator onto 
the end of the site URL and they've got to the login page of your administration 
area, you had better make sure that the Super Administrator account cannot be 
cracked very easily. By default, it's called admin, so that would be the first guess of

You can change the username of the Super Administrator account from the User 
Manager, so make sure you do this before going any further. And make sure the 
password is not admin either!!!
Setting Permissions for Mambo 
Operations
We've talked about the file system permissions, and their importance for allowing 
Mambo to go about its business. During its normal running Mambo does not 
perform a lot of writing to the files and folders in the installation. It is only really 
when installing new extensions, or making configuration changes, that Mambo 
needs access to the file system. Here we'll look at some of the common Mambo tasks, 
and the permission settings needed to get them working.
Configuration Settings
Whenever you need to make configuration changes, you will need to reset the 
privileges of the configuration.php file to 777. After the changes have been saved, 
it is wise to restore these to their original values. Although Mambo can attempt to 
change the permissions itself, this operation could fail on your web host depending 
on the way your server has been configured for you.
Media Uploading
One folder that will definitely need to be writeable is the images/stories folder. 
This is where resources are uploaded to by the Media Manager. To allow the 
Media Manager to operate properly, you will need to set the permissions for 
images/stories to 777.

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 284 ]
Caching
For caching to work properly, you will need to set the cache folder in your Mambo 
installation to writeable. If you have chosen another folder to cache to (this can be 
done from the Cache tab of the Global Configuration page) then obviously that 
folder needs to be writeable.
Modules that display RSS feeds can use caching as we saw in Chapter 5. This cache 
is stored in a different place, in includes\magpie_cache. You will need to make this 
folder writeable to cache RSS feeds for your modules.
Database Backup Permissions
If you use Mambo's tool for backing up your database, and attempt to store the 
database backups on the server along with your Mambo installation, they will be 
stored in the administrator/backups folder. Again, you will want to make this 
folder writeable before you attempt to create a backup of your site's database, or 
writing the backup will fail.
When attempting to restore a database backup, the uploadfiles folder in the root of 
your installation needs to be writeable as we mentioned earlier.
Installing Extensions or Templates
To install extensions, the folder into which they will be installed needs to be 
writeable. However, since an extension may have a front-end and a back-end part, 
you will need to make sure that both folders are made writeable.
For example, to install a component, you will need to set the permissions of 
the components folder to 777. You will also need to set the permissions of the 
administrator/components folder to 777.
As you install an extension with the Universal Installer, it should report errors. 
Sometimes, however, it may not do, and it might appear that your extension has 
been installed, since it's on the list of components, for example. However, when you 
look in the components folder, you don't see any code for it. You can detect this kind 
of thing from looking at, say, the list of Installed Components:

Chapter 12
[ 285 ]
You will see the zOOm Media Gallery component has no information, suggesting 
that not everything is as it seems with that component, and it should be deinstalled 
straightaway before attempting to reconfigure and reinstall. When uninstalling a 
"phantom" extension (namely one that Mambo says is installed, of which you can't 
find any evidence), Mambo may report some errors, but the overall procedure 
should be successful.
A module is generally either a Site module or an Administrator Module. A Site 
module only needs permissions to the modules folder in the root of the Mambo 
installation; it does not need access to the administrator folder. Although the 
module has an administrative aspect, this is taken care of by the XML file that 
accompanies the module PHP file in the modules folder. Administrator modules, 
namely modules that work only on the back end of the site, need permissions to the 
administrator/modules folder.
If you want to install new templates, you will need to set the templates folder to be 
writeable while you install the new template.
After installing your extension, you can reset the permissions of any of the folders 
involved in the installation back to 755 for security.
Installing Extensions without ZLIB
The ZLIB PHP extension allows PHP to work with ZIP archives, and extract files 
from (or add files to) the archive. Your server may not support this extension, and 
uploading extensions to your Mambo site may fail because of this.
If this is the case, you will first need to extract the files locally, and then upload 
them to a folder on your remote server. You can install them from the Install from 
Directory option of the Universal Installer. To do this, you will need either to know 
the full path (on the server) of the folder where you uploaded the extension files, or 
if you can't work that out, to create a folder inside the administration folder, and 
copy the folder with the extension files into that folder.
The screenshot overleaf shows attempting to install a component copied to a folder 
called tobeuploaded in the administrator folder. Mambo will look for the folder 
relative to the administrator folder if you don't specify the full path to the folder.

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 286 ]
Click the Install button on the Install from Directory panel and (provided you've 
set the permissions properly for the folders into which the various parts of the 
extensions need to go, as discussed above) the files will be distributed where they are 
supposed to go, and the extension will be installed.
Restricting Access to Folders
Although there are an awful lot of PHP scripts in the Mambo installation, only a 
handful of these are actually accessed by a browser. The different variables in the 
querystring are used by Mambo to decide which other files to include and process. 
What this means is that you can restrict browser access to a number of folders in the 
Mambo installation without affecting your site. This effectively increases the security 
of your site, since visitors are not able to go to places where they shouldn't.
In general, pages do not need to be requested from �������������
folders like components, 
modules, language, and cache. ����������������������������������������������
These folders contain mostly PHP or XML files 
that are used directly by Mambo. There is nothing in here that a visitor should be 
requesting directly.
The includes folder is another folder that feels like it shouldn't contain any directly 
requested files, but there are some JavaScript files in there that will be needed 
by browsers.
The templates folder and the images folder contain files that browsers will need 
to access: images, CSS files, JavaScript files, and so on. The mambots folder should 
not really allow access, except that the editors folder contains the HTML editors, 
which have a number of resources that web browsers need to use them (JavaScripts, 
images, and so on).

Chapter 12
[ 287 ]
The easiest way to restrict browser access is through the use of .htaccess files. Your 
Mambo installation has an .htaccess file supplied with it, (its called htaccess.txt 
by default). This is the file you need if you want to turn on the search-engine friendly 
URLs. You can restrict access to the folders we mentioned above by adding the 
highlighted lines below to the end of the file:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^content/(.*) index3.php
RewriteRule ^component/(.*) index3.php
RewriteRule ^mos/(.*) index3.php
RewriteRule ^modules/(.*) index3.php
RewriteRule ^language/(.*) index3.php
RewriteRule ^cache/(.*) index3.php
These lines simply add some extra rewriting rules. For example, any request that 
begins with modules will be sent to index3.php, and any thing in the request after 
the initial modules/ part will be discarded.
These rules need to be added to the end of the file because there are some rewrite 
rules used by Mambo's search-engine friendly URL mechanism earlier in the file. 
These need to be dealt with before we restrict access to the folders, since some of 
these rules actually involve the folders in question.
If you want to use the .htaccess file for restricting access, but don't want to turn on 
the search-engine friendly URLs, that's fine. Turning on the search-engine friendly 
URLs is a two-stage process: first of all, Mambo processes any URL pointing to 
part of the site into the friendlier form, and then the .htaccess file processes these 
friendly URLs back into a form understood by Mambo internally.
Restricting Access to the Administrator 
Area
The administrator area of any Mambo installation will be in the administrator 
folder. Renaming or moving the administrator area is problematic in the current 
version of Mambo. This means that any visitor to your site can easily locate the 
administrator area and start trying username and password combinations to gain 
access to your most precious place. One way to add an extra layer of security is 
to use HTTP Authentication. HTTP Authentication requires a visitor to enter a 
username and password into a dialog box before they can continue:

Deploying and Running Your Site
[ 288 ]
If your server supports SSL, then you can access the administrator area under 
HTTPS, which adds another layer of security to all of this.
On your remote server, your control panel may allow you to protect certain folders 
with passwords, which would take care of this process for us. If you don't have 
that feature on your remote server, you can set up HTTP Authentication with an 
.htaccess file in the administrator folder. Create a file called .htaccess, and 
add this text:
AuthName "Restricted Area" 
AuthType Basic 
AuthUserFile�/�om�/.��pa��wd��
 /home/.htpasswds 
Require valid-user
The important line is AuthUserFile, which specifies the location of the password file. 
You can create the password file using the htpasswd utility supplied with Apache 
in your local XAMPP installation. This file is located in the bin folder of the apache 
folder in your XAMPP installation, and is used like this, from the command-line:
htpasswd –c "c:\passwords\mypasswords" secretuser
This command creates a file for holding usernames and passwords (called 
mypasswords) in a folder called passwords. The first user to be added is 
secretuser. After entering this command, you will be prompted for the password 
for secretuser, and then asked to confirm it:
C:\apachefriends\xampp\apache\bin>htpasswd -c 
                                  "c:\passwords\mypasswords" secretuser
Automatically using MD5 format.
New password: *******
Re-type new password: *******
Adding password for user secretuser

Chapter 12
[ 289 ]
The password file is simply a text file, with the username followed by an encrypted 
version of the password:
secretuser:$apr1$UQ1.....$A0wq13rxrbSNFKADay.qi
You can add another username and password to the file by using the htpasswd 
command again:
C:\apachefriends\xampp\apache\bin>htpasswd -c 
                                  "c:\passwords\mypasswords" anotheruser
You will be prompted for the password for this user, and the details will be saved to 
your passwords file.
Once you've created your password file, you can upload it to your remote server, 
and ensure that the AuthUserFile line of the .htaccess file points to the uploaded 
file. Since this is a text file with usernames, you want to make sure that this file is not 
in the document root of your web server, so that it can't be requested by a browser. 
If the path to the password file is wrong, you will be asked for the username and 
password over and over again when you browse to the folder, since the server can't 
find a file to check the passwords against!
If you are having problems with the exact path to your password file on the remote 
server, have a look in the Mambo configuration file for some of the paths in there:
$mosConfig_absolute_path = '/home/zaksprings/public_html/..';
If you have put your passwords file off the web root, so it's in the folder above 
public_html, then the path to the folder containing the passwords file would be
/home/zaksprings/ in this case.
Summary
In this chapter, we walked through the steps to deploy a Mambo installation onto a 
remote web server, and set the permissions to allow it function properly. Creating a 
new installation of Mambo on the remote server isn't too big a problem, the twist here 
was to take all the data from the local installation and migrate it to the remote site.
We began with an overview of the process to follow:
Upload the files for our local Mambo installation via FTP
Upload the installation folder from the original set of files Mambo via FTP
Get an empty database ready for Mambo
Use the web installer to get a basic Mambo site working
Restore the database from our local installation onto the remote server

Deploying and Running Your Site

We discussed file system permissions, since Mambo needs to write files into various 
folders during parts of its operation, and it is important to set these properly to avoid 
failure of various activities.
We saw how to back up and restore the Mambo database from the administration 
area of Mambo, and then had a look at a number of common Mambo administrative 
tasks and the permission settings needed to get them working.

Installing XAMPP
In this appendix we will walk through downloading, installing, and setting up the 
XAMPP package. XAMPP is a free package that has a collection of free applications 
assembled to provide you with an easy-to-set up web server (Apache), database 
server (MySQL), and server-side scripting language (PHP). XAMPP lets you 
experiment with these technologies and develop your own web applications. 
Setting up an AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) environment has typically required 
configuring the different applications to work on their own, and then to work with 
each other. With XAMPP this interplay has already been set up for you, and the 
system comes ready configured and ready to go. In addition to being easy to get 
started, XAMPP includes a number of useful extensions, code libraries, and other 
applications, all already configured so you don't need to spend a long time trying to 
get them working together.
Note that we are installing XAMPP here as a 'development' or 
'testing' environment only. We will only be using XAMPP for 
testing and exploring the technologies, and not as a 'production' 
environment for serving our website to the outside world. 
Setting up a production web server and a database server, and 
securing and optimizing them is a topic beyond the scope of 
this text.
There are versions of the XAMPP package available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS 
X, and the Solaris operating system. XAMPP is free to download, and the package 
contains the following:
The AMP environment of Apache 2, MySQL 5, and PHP versions 4 and 5.
Lots of PHP extensions, which add extra functionality. In particular, the 
extensions required by Mambo are all in the XAMPP installation.

phpMyAdmin, the leading web-based interface to MySQL.
The PEAR library. PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository) 
is a framework for reusable PHP components, and is a favorite among 
professional PHP developers. You can find out more about PEAR at 
pear.php.net.
An implementation of OpenSSL for running your site under HTTPS.
The advantage of the XAMPP package is that everything you need is collected 
together for you, tested, and ready to go. The downside is that you will have a very 
large file to download. On the brighter side, you only have to download one file 
rather than downloading lots of files, and then trying to get them working.
The home of the XAMPP package is the site www.apachefriends.org/en/. The 
installation walkthrough in this chapter may not solve all your problems, and only 
covers Windows. If you find yourself in need of further help, check out the XAMPP 
documentation page at:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/faq-xampp.html
Details of the XAMPP package itself can be found at:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
On that page, you will find a link to the XAMPP version for your particular 
operating system. We will be choosing XAMPP for Windows. Clicking the XAMPP 
for Windows link on this page brings you to: 
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html
You will find that there are several options for downloading XAMPP. First, you can 
choose one of three types of package:
XAMPP
XAMPP add-ons
XAMPP Lite
Each of these packages is available in different download formats, a Windows 
installer file, a ZIP file, or a self-extracting 7-ZIP archive:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Appendix A
[ 293 ]
We will be choosing the Installer version of the Basic XAMPP package. This is some 
33MB to download.
There is also a XAMPP Lite package that is about half the size of the full XAMPP 
package, but it does contain everything that you will need to run the code in this 
book. However, the Lite package does not come as a Windows installer.
Clicking the Installer link takes you to a page where you select the 'nearest' 
SourceForge mirror site from which to download the file. You can download the file 
from any of the sites listed, so you might want to pick the one nearest to you. The 
downloaded file will have a filename of the form:
xampp-win32-1.5.5-installer.exe
The 1.5.5 part is the current XAMPP version.
We will install the XAMP package into a folder called c:\apachefriends\. Before 
we begin, create that folder.
We begin by double-clicking on the file, and we will be presented with a dropdown 
to choose the language of our installation. Select English and click OK to move on to 
the welcome page, which displays a simple message, and you can click Next to move 
to the start of the process.
You will be presented with a dialog asking you to choose the location for XAMPP 
to install its files into. XAMPP will create a folder called xampp in the Destination 
Folder specified, and add its files in there. Clicking the Browse button allows you to 
choose our apachefriends folder.

Installing XAMPP
[ 294 ]
Click Next, which will allow you to choose XAMPP install options:

Appendix A
[ 295 ]
In the SERVICE SECTION choose the Install Apache as service and Install MySQL 
as service options. You can keep the the last option to install Filezilla as a service 
unchecked since we don't have any need to run an FTP server in this book.
If you are running the IIS server or Skype VOIP application, 
then exit them before attempting to install Apache as a 
Windows Service. Otherwise, the Apache service will fail to 
install as a Windows Service, with XAMPP reporting a problem 
with port 443 (for Skype) or port 80 (for IIS). 
Click Install to continue and the installation begins. The files are extracted and 
copied to the specified folder. A command-line window will open at one point, right 
before the end; do not be disturbed by that. After the command-line window closes, 
the installation is complete, and you are presented with the end screen. Click Finish 
to complete the installation.
After this, you are presented with a congratulatory message, and an option to view 
the Control Panel:
The XAMPP Control Panel is used to control and monitor the status of the services that 
XAMPP has installed. When the Control Panel is running, you will see an icon like: 
in your System Tray, and you can double-click it to get the XAMPP Control Panel 
back on your screen. If you have closed the Control Panel, you can open it again 
from Start | Programs | apachefriends | XAMPP | XAMPP Control Panel. 
Alternatively, you can control and monitor these services in the usual way from the 
Windows Control Panel (Start | Settings | Control Panel) by using the Services 
area found in Administrative Tools.
With our servers installed as services, we are ready to go. Open up your browser, 
and enter http://localhost/ into the navigation bar. You should see the following 
splash screen, inviting you to select a language. We will select English:

Installing XAMPP
[ 296 ]
Now you will be taken to your XAMPP homepage. In future you will be taken 
directly to this page when you enter http://localhost/ into your browser, 
bypassing the language splash screen.

Appendix A
[ 297 ]
You will find a range of options in the left-hand panel for you to test out what comes 
with XAMPP. Of particular interest is phpMyAdmin, which we will be making use 
of in many parts of the book, and which is likely to become a very important tool as 
you work more with PHP and MySQL. You can click the link in the left-hand panel, 
or enter its URL (http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/) directly into the browser to get 
started with it.
By default, XAMPP is configured to run PHP 5. If you want to switch to PHP 4, then 
you will find a file called php-switch.bat in the apachefriends\xampp\ folder 
that allows you to make the switch between PHP 5 and PHP 4 (and back again). 
However, before you can use it you need to stop the Apache Service. 
Open up the XAMPP Control Panel, and click the Stop button next to the Apache 
service. You should see a message reporting the service has been stopped:
Now double-click the file php-switch.bat in the apachefriends\xampp folder, and 
a command‑line window will open, and you will be prompted to choose the version 
of PHP.
Simply press 4 followed by Enter, and XAMPP will switch over to PHP 4 for you. 
Once it has completed, you will see a message containing this report:
  OKAY ... PHP SWITCHING WAS SUCCESSFUL
Press any key to close the window. You will now have to restart Apache from the 
Control Panel by clicking the Start button, and then you can return to your browser 
and visit your XAMPP home page. Once you are finished with the Control Panel, 
click Exit to shut it down.

Installing XAMPP
[ 298 ]
You can use php-switch.bat to switch back to PHP 5 again if you want to continue 
working with PHP 5, but remember to stop the Apache service before using it.
Before we finish off, it's worth noting two important folders in your XAMPP 
installation.
C:\Program Files\apachefriends\xampp\htdocs: This folder is your 
'document root'. A file placed in this folder will be made available by the web 
server. We will be copying our installation of Mambo into this folder to get it 
working properly.
apache: This folder contains a file called apache_installservice.bat. If 
Apache failed to install as a service during the installation process, then you 
can run this file to try again. 
Your XAMPP installation is now set up and working, and you are ready to begin 
installing Mambo.
