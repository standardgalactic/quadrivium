Introduction
Before I started working on this book, I took a look at the first book I wrote on Zoho—
Foundation Zoho: Work and Create Online—and I was amazed by how far we have come 
since 2009.
Technology has advanced so much in less than a decade that 2009 feels like ages ago. 
Smartphones, big data, Blockchain, 3D printing, civilian drones, artificial intelligence, and 
the Internet of Things (IoT) have all graduated from lab life and entered our daily lives.
However, none of these technologies (yet) has had as great an impact on our 
civilization as cloud computing. This may sound like a very bold claim, but bear with me 
for a moment.
Many of us nowadays keep our collection of documents on Dropbox or Google Drive, 
kill time (or do something more productive) on Instagram and Facebook, rely on CRM 
(Customer Relationship Management) systems to manage our sales processes, take notes 
on Wunderlist, and manage projects on Trello.
Back in 2009, cloud computing was a relatively new phenomenon, and many 
companies—small and large—were too hesitant to even give it a try. High-speed Internet 
was not as ubiquitous as it is now and mobile computing was in its infancy. Heck, the 
Blackberry was the king of the smartphones.
All these are courtesy of some SaaS (software as a service) on a public cloud 
platform. Remove cloud computing from the equation and you can’t even play Pokémon 
Go on your smartphone.
Eight years later, Internet connectivity has doubled (http://www.internetlivestats.
com/internet-users/) and almost half of the population of the planet is connected. 
Today, it is practically impossible to go through a full day (sometimes a full hour) without 
using the amazing apps and services that run on the cloud. But what is cloud computing 
anyway?
Cloud Computing
The Internet, also referred to as “the cloud” in IT jargon, powers today’s civilization.
Why on earth do we use the word “cloud” as a metaphor for the Internet, you ask? 
Since the old days, it was common when someone wanted to refer to a big collection of 
servers (i.e., a server farm) in an IT diagram, that they would simply draw a cloud to hide 
the complexity and just connect other machines to it (see Figure 1).

■ Introduction
xviii
Cloud computing, to put it simply, uses the computing power of the cloud in 
combination, or instead of, the power of the computer on your desk or the one in your 
pocket. As trivial as this definition may sound, cloud computing offers unique features, 
such as:
• 
Availability—All you need is an Internet connection to connect to 
any cloud anywhere.
• 
Performance—The immense power of thousands of servers is at 
your disposal.
• 
Elasticity—You can only use and pay for the computing power 
and storage you need for the task in hand, scale up when you 
need more resources, and scale back down when you don’t.
• 
Multi-tenancy—Multiple tenants (apps, services, users, etc.) 
can use the power of a cloud allowing for resources to be used 
efficiently and costs to be divided between such tenants.
• 
Security—Clouds can be way more secure than your local 
computer, or local server, since cloud providers have many more 
resources to allocate safeguarding their infrastructure, which in 
turn keeps the tenants more secure.
• 
Reliability—Your data is backed up and is available across 
multiple physical locations, thus minimizing the risk of data loss 
to almost zero.
• 
Maintenance—Cloud users (tenants) need not worry about 
upgrading servers, power outages, or software updates, all of 
which are done for them by the cloud provider.
• 
Cost—All these conditions contribute to a major benefit of cloud 
computing, which is lowering the cost across the board.
Figure 1.  The original cloud

■ Introduction
xix
In general, there are three types of clouds:
• 
Public—As the name suggests, these are publicly available for 
everyone to utilize, such as Amazon AWS.
• 
Private—Only accessible to the organization or organizations 
owning that cloud.
• 
Hybrid—Obviously, a combination of public and private clouds.
■
■Note   I stay shallow with these definitions as this book is not about the science of 
cloud computing. The main audience of this book is businesspeople, who I can bet are least 
interested in the voodoo behind the technology and merely want to utilize tools that can 
make their lives easier.
The Importance and Scale of Cloud Computing
As mentioned, it is safe to say that anything digital nowadays runs on some sort of cloud 
infrastructure. Our civilization depends on the cloud, an industry that is poised to grow to 
$270 billion by the year 2020 (http://247wallst.com/technology-3/2015/03/07/the-
270-billon-cloud-computing-market/).
In their 2009 report, “Cloud Computing Forecasting Change” (http://public.
deloitte.no/dokumenter/2_Cloud_Computing%5B1%5D.pdf), Deloitte called cloud 
computing the “next technological disruption to transform enterprise IT delivery and 
services”. It is a brilliant piece, and it counts cloud computing along with social networks, 
mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT) among the major disruptors and contributors to 
the maturity of the Internet.
Deloitte’s prediction about cloud computing was impressively accurate. What 
Deloitte and many other experts did not quite predict, however, was the great impact on 
and massive adoption of cloud computing by small to medium size businesses (SMBs).
In January 2016, RightScale surveyed 1,060 technical professionals (627 from SMBs) 
about their adoption of cloud computing. (http://assets.rightscale.com/uploads/
pdfs/RightScale-2016-State-of-the-Cloud-Report.pdf). The results are a testament 
to how successful cloud computing has been in the recent years:
• 
77% of the SMBs are using cloud computing in some capacity in 
their organizations
• 
Only 9% said they have no plans for cloud adoption
• 
Cloud security is no longer the top challenge, dethroned now by 
lack of resources and expertise
• 
Cloud users leverage six clouds on average
• 
Amazon AWS leads the pack while Microsoft Azure is growing 
market as a major cloud infrastructure provider

■ Introduction
xx
At its core, cloud computing allows organizations (and individuals) to harness the 
virtually unlimited computing and storage power of hundreds of thousands of servers 
located in a myriad of datacenters across the world.
With the immense power of cloud at their fingertips, even the smallest companies 
can analyze terabytes of data at will, fast, and cheap, which helps them create massively 
useful applications and stay ahead of the competition.
Companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Waze, Instagram, Snapchat, and hundreds of 
others whose apps you use on daily basis all started small by writing their apps on top of 
cloud platforms. The startup revolution in the past decade owes its success heavily to the 
availability, affordability, and scalability of cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS, Google 
AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure.
Now with the next wave of computing—mainstream AI (Artificial Intelligence)—upon 
us, companies such as Amazon are working to make it possible for the software developers 
and cloud users to have access to sophisticated AI capabilities on the cheap. (http://www.
allthingsdistributed.com/2016/11/amazon-ai-and-alexa-for-all-aws-apps.html).
The Service Economy
Cloud computing allows various services and applications to be implemented on it. This 
allows a “service” model in which virtually everything can be offered as a service that is 
implemented and distributed on some sort of a cloud. This concept is called Everything 
as a Service or X as a Service (XaaS).
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are two examples 
of what can be offered as a service in the cloud. But the most evident and most relevant to 
of all these to the end users (including you, dear reader) is Software as a Service (SaaS).
Let’s start with a real-life example.
A few years ago, if I needed Microsoft Office, I had to pay full price for and buy and 
own the software before I could use it. A few hundred dollars wouldn’t break the bank 
maybe, but now imagine if I wanted to have Office on all 15 workstations at work and 
had to commit a few thousand dollars in basic software expenses. Plus, I needed to have 
IT take care of updates and patches (more expense) and then pay again for every major 
version released.
Today, with Office 365, not only will I always have access to the latest version of 
the Office software on my laptop, tablet, and phone with the same license, but software 
updates run automatically, so I get to use 1TB (yes, that is 1000 gigabytes) of free space 
on OneCloud (Microsoft’s cloud storage service). Plus I have access to all my documents 
with editing capability in the browser.
That means I can leave my laptop at home and go on a vacation and edit my 
documents wherever there is a computer connected to the Internet. The best part? I pay a 
fraction of the cost on a monthly basis and I can cancel my contract anytime I want.
The same applies for my company. I pay for new monthly license when someone 
joins the team and I cancel their contract when someone leaves.
This is the power of Software as a Service, or SaaS.
Unlike Microsoft Office, the majority of SaaS apps do not even need to install on your 
local computer. You can access them on a modern Internet browser on a desktop, laptop, 
tablet, or a mobile device.

■ Introduction
xxi
The main advantage here is that SaaS doesn’t rely much on local computer power, 
so you don’t need a high-performance machine to run your massive CRM used by 2000 
employees across three continents. A $200 Chromebook (https://www.google.com/
chromebook/about/) will do the job too.
This book is about one of these SaaS applications—Zoho Creator. By the end of 
this book, you will know how you can create world-class customized cloud-based 
applications. These applications will help you avoid cookie-cutter expensive solutions 
and use internal resources to automate and improve your business processes and 
manage your organizational information effectively.
The big news is that you will be able to do all this with little to no programming skills.
All About Zoho
Zoho, the company behind Zoho Creator and an impressive suite of 34 other SaaS apps, 
has been in business since 1996. Launched back in November 2007, Zoho Creator is one 
of Zoho’s main offerings with unique features and little competition.
■
■Note   You can read more about history of Zoho and the brains behind it on the web site 
at https://www.zoho.com/aboutus.html.
I have been an avid user of the Zoho suite, especially Zoho Creator and Zoho CRM, 
since 2008. In fact, Zoho Creator was my first encounter with a full-fledged SaaS application.
I have recommended Zoho to many friends, colleagues, and clients, all of whom have 
ended up becoming happy users. Powerful and easy to use software, cost-effectiveness, 
and good support are some of the main factors that keep me and thousands of other 
organizations and individuals as loyal customers.
I hope this book helps you decide whether Zoho Creator is the right choice for you, 
and if it is, how to best utilize it in your day-to-day business.
Who This Book Is For
This book is for everyone who needs to avoid the cookie-cutter expensive information 
solutions and wants. With Zoho Creator, you can create an application tailor-made to 
your specific business requirements without paying an arm and a leg for it.
This book is for you if you:
• 
Want to create business applications and information solutions 
to solve your day-to-day problems without prior programming 
knowledge or the help of software developers and expensive 
external consultants
• 
Have little time and budget and still need a fully customized 
business application that doesn’t break the bank

■ Introduction
xxii
• 
Want to make a living creating cloud-based applications and offer 
consultancy for your clients
• 
Are already a Zoho Creator user, administrator, developer, or 
solution provider and want to learn more about its unique 
features
Zoho Creator is not and doesn’t claim to be a replacement for advanced programming 
languages (e.g., Java), frameworks (e.g., Django), or enterprise platforms (e.g., SAP).
Creator is unlike anything you have seen before and you need to experience it 
to truly appreciate the vision of its makers and learn how you can leverage it in your 
business environment. From a single-person operation to a large enterprise, there is a 
place for Creator to come in handy and save the day.
What You Will Learn
In this book, you learn to:
• 
Basics of building good software
• 
Build Zoho Creator applications quickly and properly from the 
ground up
• 
Learn the inner workings of Creator and business application 
development best-practices
• 
Learn the Deluge scripting language, Zoho’s modern and data-
oriented language
• 
Create and launch a real-world business applications, a real estate 
management system, from idea to rollout
• 
Integrate your apps with third-party tools and services
• 
Extend the capabilities of other Zoho apps such as CRM
How the Book Is Structured
The aim of this book is to provide you with a practical guide to get up and running fast, 
but correctly, with Zoho Creator. Depending on your interest and requirements, you can 
delve deeper in each topic while having this book as a guide on your side.
■
■Tip  Throughout the book there are frequent references to the official documentation 
as well as other external sources. It wouldn’t make sense to cover every single feature or 
capability of Zoho Creator in a single volume. Also, Zoho Creator, like any other cloud-based 
app, adds new features frequently. It is a good habit to check the documentation often and 
leverage the latest features and capabilities in your applications.

■ Introduction
xxiii
This book starts with a quick review of the Zoho suite of cloud-based apps in 
Chapter 1. This chapter gives you a brief idea of what other Zoho apps you could be 
using in your business.
In Chapter 2, you get a bird’s eye view of the important concepts and methodologies 
you need to consider while designing any kind of software, including Zoho Creator. 
This chapter is a door opener to concepts that each could take multiple books to cover. 
However, merely giving you an idea about the importance of each topic will encourage 
you to employ them in your practice and learn more about them if you need to.
In Chapter 3, you create your very first app using Creator’s ready-made templates to 
get a sense about what a Creator app looks like.
Chapter 4 teaches you how to create a simple inquiry form app from scratch and get 
more familiar with the inner workings of a Creator app.
In Chapter 5, you create a more advanced app to let visitors apply for job vacancies 
in your organization. You are introduced to Deluge, Zoho’s scripting language, and 
make your app responsive to user behavior. You also learn about Creator’s automation, 
notification, and scheduling features.
Chapter 6 is a tour of the Deluge scripting language. It is a robust, easy to learn, and 
easy to use language and is required for more advanced apps.
In Chapter 7, you combine your knowledge and build an advanced real estate 
management system. You learn more about Creator and software development  
best-practices in the process.
Finally, in Chapter 8, I give you quick tour on how to extend Creator’s capabilities by 
integrating it into other Zoho apps as well as third-party software and services. The true 
power of cloud-based applications is when they join forces and accomplish more with 
minimal effort from the developers’ side. There is no need to reinvent the wheel if you 
know how to reuse it for different vehicles.
How to Best Read This Book
If you are new to Zoho Creator or the subject of business application development in 
general, I recommend you start from the beginning and follow the order of the chapters.
If you have signed up for Creator, watched a couple of video tutorials, and built some 
basic apps, you can skip to Chapter 4 or 5, where things get interesting with code and 
automation. Then you can continue with the rest of the book.
For more experienced Creator developers, I suggest skimming through Chapters 4 to 6, 
and then reading Chapters 7 and 8.
For developers coming from other languages, regardless of experience level,  
I recommend having a quick read of Chapters 3 and 4, then spending more time on 
the rest of the chapters. I can guarantee that you will be amazed by how much you can 
accomplish with little to no coding. Then make sure you read Chapter 8 and review the 
REST API documentation online.

CHAPTER 1
Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
The Zoho Corporation has come a long way since they released their first SaaS apps, 
Writer and CRM (Customer Relationship Management), in 2005. Writer became an 
inseparable part of the productivity apps and CRM has grown to be one of the core Zoho 
products, serving millions of people around the world, yours truly included.
From the app diversity and completeness of offerings perspective, Zoho still holds a 
unique and strong position in the market while other companies have focused on one or 
a few products around a core objective.
There are many fantastic SaaS apps out there; however, none I used or read about 
offer the selection that Zoho does. This allows users to use a wide range of apps with 
single sign-on, familiar look and feel, and interoperability (i.e., the ability to exchange 
and use information between apps) out of the box.
Zoho apps are divided into six categories:
• 
Sales and Marketing
• 
E-mail and Collaboration
• 
Business Process
• 
Finance
• 
IT and Help Desk
• 
Human Resources
Now let’s take a very quick look at each one of these categories and their respective 
apps before we dive into Zoho CRM.
■
■Note   This chapter merely scratches the surface and only provides a quick introduction 
of all members of the Zoho suite. The aim is to simply let you know what each app can do 
and leave further investigation to you to see whether one or more of these apps could help 
your business in any way.

Sales and Marketing Apps
The beating heart of any business, be it a home-based solo operation or a multinational 
conglomerate, is sales. Marketing, on the other hand, provides insights of the market 
and helps the business stay competitive while promoting its products and services to the 
world. The duo of Marketing and Sales is inseparable.
At the core of Zoho suite, there are a number of apps that help you manage almost all 
your marketing and sales operations, all connected in the cloud.
CRM
Zoho CRM is arguably the star of the show with the highest number of users among Zoho 
apps. First released in 2005, CRM has grown from a small solution for beginners to a  
full-fledged suite of applications competing with the industry leaders in many fronts.
The landscape of cloud-based CRM systems for small and medium-sized businesses 
is quite competitive and there are formidable contenders in the market for every 
requirement and budget. The spectrum of SaaS CRM systems seems endless with 
open source and free offerings inside of the spectrum to full-fledged industry specific 
solutions on the other hand. Bitrix24, Highrise, Hubspot, Infusionsoft, Insightly, Microsoft 
Dynamics, Pipedrive, Salesforce, and Sugar CRM are just a few that come to mind.
A CRM is one of the most important, if not the most important, tools for your 
business. So, choosing the right one early on is crucial. No matter if you are about to start 
your business in a month, are currently bootstrapping, or have been in business for the 
past 15 years managing a team of 100 sales people across the globe, Zoho CRM can play a 
key role in managing and streamlining your marketing, sales, and client servicing efforts.
Zoho CRM offers five different editions, each of which packs a host of features 
suitable for different tastes and needs:
• 
Free edition—This edition offers the core modules such as Leads, 
Accounts, Contacts, Feeds, Documents, and mobile apps for up 
to 10 users, completely free of charge. This is a great way to start 
using Zoho CRM and then you can upgrade to one of the paid 
editions as your business needs grow.
• 
Standard edition—In addition to the features available in the 
Free edition, you have access to sales forecasting, reports and 
dashboards, document library, roles and profiles, mass e-mail, 
call center connectors, and the ability to store up to 100,000 
records of information.
• 
Professional edition—Offers all the features available in Free 
and Standard editions, plus e-mail integration, social features, 
Google AdWords integration, workflow automation, inventory 
management, macros, and the ability to store unlimited records.
• 
Enterprise edition—This edition offers territory management, 
custom applications, custom buttons, workflow approval 
processes, page layouts, custom modules, and multiple currencies 
on top of the features available to Professional edition.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

• 
Ultimate edition—Last, but not least, the Ultimate edition adds 
even more features to make it the choice for larger organizations 
by throwing in a sandbox, dedicated database cluster, priority 
support, advanced customization, advanced CRM analytics, and 
enhanced storage.
• 
CRM Plus—A recent addition to the CRM family, CRM Plus 
provides a more holistic approach to the traditional CRM system 
by combining the Enterprise edition with Zoho Campaigns, Desk, 
SalesIQ, Social, Projects, Survey, and Reports. This package allows 
users to centralize all their marketing, sales, and client servicing 
processes in one place without the need to jump between different 
platforms, while saving considerably in direct and indirect costs.
One of the areas that Zoho CRM excels compared to its rivals is the lower barrier to 
entry. Zoho CRM allows organizations of up to 10 employees to use it free of charge for sales 
management and then later upgrade to a suitable paid edition as they need more features.
■
■Note   If you want to learn more about Zoho CRM and how you can leverage its power 
to succeed in your business, feel free to pick up my other book, Mastering Zoho CRM, 
by Apress. This book is a practical, no-nonsense guide for managing the three pillars of 
your business—marketing, sales, and client servicing—using one of the best CRM suites 
available in the market.
SalesInbox
A new addition to the Zoho suite, SalesInbox claims to be the first mailbox specifically 
designed for salespeople. According to Zoho, SalesInbox automatically organizes and 
prioritizes sales activities based one sales pipeline and the stage of each deal. Using Zoho 
CRM criteria and rules features, SalesInbox could become the sales team’s best friend and 
put an end to the manual work between e-mail and CRM.

SalesIQ
Zoho SalesIQ is a live chat solution that you can install and enable on your web site to 
understand how visitors are interacting with your web site in real time. It provides the 
visitors of your web site with a familiar chat box placed on a corner of a web page, so they 
can ask the sales or support team for help right away, or leave a message without leaving 
the page.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

You can use SalesIQ in conjunction with Zoho CRM and streamline the conversion 
of site visitors to prospects and ultimately buying customers. You should consider 
using SalesIQ if you are serious about capturing web site visitors and turning them into 
customers or providing them with an interactive support channel.
The Free edition provides a decent set of features for you to get up and running with 
SalesIQ and later upgrade to one of the paid editions as your requirements grow.

Survey
Zoho Survey is a versatile tool to create online surveys and collect information from leads, 
prospects, or existing clients through a number of questions. You can dispatch surveys 
on your web site, via mobile or e-mail, and store the collected information from these 
channels in the backend of the survey for later analysis.
Apart from standard survey building and distributing features, Zoho Survey 
automatically translates your surveys to 30 languages (https://www.zoho.com/survey/
translate-survey.html) and integrates well with e-mail campaign apps such as Zoho 
Campaigns and MailChimp.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Survey, check out: https://www.zoho.com/

Campaigns
Another powerful app in Zoho’s arsenal is Campaigns, which offers all the tools you 
need to run successful e-mail campaigns. It integrates well with other core Zoho apps, 
especially CRM, removing the need for third-party solutions in most cases.
Any modern organization needs to include e-mail marketing in some shape or 
form in their business practice. Staying in touch with customers as well prospects is 
crucial and Campaigns allows you to do just that. Despite social media being a major 
channel for connecting with your audience, e-mail still remains the most effective way of 
communication and making sales happen.
Moreover, Campaigns offers e-mail templates to get you up and running in minutes, 
plus e-mail automation features to save you time and help your campaigns be more 
effective. It also provides you with detailed campaign reporting tools for monitoring and 
fine-tuning your efforts.
There is a free edition that allows storing up to 2,000 contacts and sending up to 
12,000 e-mails every month, so you have little excuse not to start sending that monthly 
newsletter you have been delaying.

Sites
Unless you are visiting us from a planet where web sites are passé, you most probably 
have a web site for your business and chances are that setting it up was not particularly a 
pleasant experience.
There was a time, not so long ago, that if you needed a visually bearable and decently 
functional web site you either needed to know some graphic design and coding in HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript (three of the main technologies behind every web site), or you were at 
the mercy of web design companies and freelancers.
Times have changed for the better. Now everyone can build a usable web site that 
looks modern, has most of the functionalities of a business web site, and works on mobile 
phones as well. Services such as Weebly and Wix allow you to simply drag and drop 
building blocks on web page skeletons and create a web site ready for prime time. Zoho 
also has their own web site creation wizard: Zoho Sites.
Zoho Sites provides you with a platform to easily and quickly create professional 
looking web sites with all the modern features you need, such as blogs, social, 
multimedia, e-commerce, and forms.
What is great is that you can do all of these without writing a single line of code or 
knowing what the difference between HTTP and HTML is.
Similar to other Zoho apps, you can start with a free plan, which offers enough 
features to get your web site up and running, and opt for the paid, more feature-rich 
edition down the road.

Social Media
Social media management has become a part of business routine of every forward-
thinking business. The immense power of social media allows you to delight prospects 
and clients by conveying a more personal and conversational message across multiple 
channels.
With the multitude of available social channels, however, it is hard to stay on top of 
publishing, monitoring, and responding to communications while staying productive and 
keeping your sanity in the process.
Fortunately, there are tools that help you manage social media, including Zoho 
Social, a capable social management tool. As of this writing, it allows you to centrally 
manage your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and Instagram accounts.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
6
You, and your team collaboratively, can publish on selected channels in one go, 
schedule messages, and monitor the performance of your messages. You can also listen 
to the social channel for what people are saying about your business or personal brand.
Another useful feature of Social is that it connects to Zoho CRM effortlessly and 
improves your productivity by providing you with contextual information about your 
social connections on the CRM as well.
As usual, you can start with Zoho Social free of charge and upgrade to a paid plan 
when you need more features.

Contact Manager
Having a standalone app for managing your contacts may seem totally unnecessary, 
but don’t mistake Zoho Contact Manager for your average contact on your laptop or 
smartphone.
Contact Manager is actually a mini CRM that allows you to store and manage your 
contact database more effectively. You can share contacts within your team, define 
and assign tasks and follow-ups around contacts, manage deals related to contacts, 
and integrate your contact database with third-party services such as Google Apps or 
MailChimp.
If you believe you don’t need a full-fledged CRM solution, Contact Manager is a great 
way to start introducing order to your sales processes and centralizing valuable client 
information.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Contact Manger, check out: https://www.zoho.com/
contactmanager/help.html.
Forms
Sometimes you need to collect information (online) from staff members, local 
community, clients, or your web site visitors. To do so, you usually place some sort of a 
form on a web page and encourage people to fill it in and submit it back to you.
However, not all forms are created equally. A form could be a simple Contact Us 
form, a long survey, or a complex form with automation workflows embedded for 
approval collection.
Traditionally, you or someone you hire would need web programming knowledge to 
create a form with such capabilities. With Zoho Forms, all you need to do is drag and drop 
form fields to a form, do some configuration, and then publish your modern looking form 
online for people to populate.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
7
Zoho Forms allows you to quickly create functional forms, collect data, analyze  
the performance of your forms, and integrate them with Zoho apps, such as CRM,  
or third-party apps, such as MailChimp, to automate tedious data entry tasks.
Again, you can start using Zoho Forms for free and upgrade to paid editions as your 
requirements grow.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Forms, check out: https://www.zoho.com/forms/
help/getting-started.html.
Motivator
Another newcomer to the Zoho suite, Motivator, is a sales activity management tool.  
It allows you to set sales targets and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for your team, 
then it automatically analyzes sale information extracted from Zoho CRM to generate 
team member performance, so top sales people are identified, acknowledged, and 
rewarded for their achievements.
Motivator has a feature called TV Channels, which allows you to show a leaderboard 
of your team performance on big screen TVs to motivate the team and encourage 
employees to compete in a healthy and rewarding environment.

E-Mail and Collaboration Apps
To complement the core apps, Zoho offers essential apps that help you manage your 
e-mails, projects, and documents, all improved for the Internet age and built from the 
ground up to house modern features, such as social and collaboration features.
A number of other apps help you stay connected with your team and perform a 
number of essential tasks, such as safely storing your passwords in a centralized location.
Mail
Zoho Mail is Zoho’s answer to popular services such as Gmail or Outlook.com. Although 
it may be much less popular compered other old timers, it is arguably one of the easiest 
to use and most feature-rich mail services in the market. Plus, it is ad-free. No more pesky 
ads in the sanctity of your inbox, ever.
In addition to the default web interface, Mail offers native smartphone apps for iOS 
and Android. You can also configure your favorite desktop or mobile e-mail client  
(Spark, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.) to check your Zoho account e-mails.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

For business users, Zoho Mail integrates well with other Zoho services such as CRM. 
You can enjoy single sign-on feature (one user account to use multiple services) and host 
one domain (i.e., yourwebsite.com), plus up to 25 users, all free of charge.

Notebook
Note-taking apps are everywhere. Many of them are average at best, and some of them 
are amazing. Good note-taking apps, such as Evernote and Microsoft OneNote, can 
massively contribute to your productivity and help you minimize clutter.
Zoho offers its own version of a note-taking app, called Zoho Notebook. It helps you 
organize your notes in a variety of formats: text, image, audio, checklists, and sketches. 
Notes offers a smartphone app for iOS and Android and a web clipper to capture content 
snippets while web surfing.
As of this writing, Zoho is yet to release a desktop versions for Notebook, similar to 
what Evernote and Microsoft OneNote offer. As an avid Evernote user since 2009, I can 
see that Zoho Notebook shows promise, especially since it sports a pleasant and  
easy-to-use interface and is 100% free.
■

Docs
Zoho Docs is a cloud-based storage space on steroids. You can store up to 5GB of files 
on free edition of Docs, sync your files between devices, and use Zoho productivity 
suite (Writer, Sheet, and Show) to edit your documents in the browser or via their native 
mobile apps.
You can download Zoho Docs desktop synchronization tool and share your 
documents between a local folder and the Docs folder seamlessly.
If you are already a Google Drive or Dropbox user, you will feel right at home with 
Zoho Docs. The free edition of Docs offers features almost identical to the free edition of 
Google Drive; however, the paid edition gives more bang for your buck compared to the 
paid edition of the Google Drive.

Projects
With hundreds of free and paid options available in the market, finding the right project 
management tool that covers all the bases and doesn’t break the bank seems like a 
daunting job.
Luckily, Zoho has a powerful project management tool called Zoho Project.  
It offers a decent combination of ease of use, features, and cost-effectiveness, making it a 
formidable choice in the crowded market of cloud-based project management tools.
With Zoho Projects you can run multiple projects across multiple teams, share 
information with clients and outsourced teams easily, create time sheets for your 
projects, create Gantt charts and other complex reports, collaborate seamlessly with all 
the stakeholders, and mange project documents and in a central environment.
You have access to your projects via browser and native mobile apps. You can also 
connect Projects to other apps such as Zoho Books and Zoho Invoice as well as third-party 
services such as Google Apps and Dropbox to maximize your productivity and efficiency.
Zoho Projects comes free of charge if you are planning to manage one project at 
a time. You can always upgrade to paid editions if you need more from your project 
management tool.

Connect
Zoho Connect allows you to create a private social network for your organizations.  
It provides you with all the basic tools and features to set up a social network for your 
team to connect and collaborate in real time.
By allowing you to create custom apps and integrate other services such as Zoho 
Projects, Zoho Docs, Google Drive, and Calendar services, Connect helps you streamline 
internal communications processes and keep employees engaged while boosting their 
productivity.

bug tracking is very important and using a powerful bug tracking service will make the 
lives of everyone involved in the project easier.

Zoho BugTracker offers all the essential features a robust bug tracking service should 
provide, plus bug automation features with workflows, out-of-the-box integration with 
GitHub and BitBucket, file sharing, collaborative dashboard environment, and SLA

Meeting
Zoho Meeting is an easy-to-use and powerful web conferencing and live collaboration 
tool that takes your remote meetings to the next level. You can schedule and run 
unlimited meetings with up to 20 hosts (paid edition) and 100 guests (paid edition) to 
join your web meetings.
Zoho Meeting allows you to remotely control a participant's computer, making it 
a great tool for remote demoing or troubleshooting. Although there is a handy desktop 
plugin, Meeting doesn’t need you to install an app to run or join meetings and is 
completely browser-based.
It also integrates well with other services such as Zoho CRM, Zoho Chat, Zoho 
Calendar, Google Calendar, and Google Apps.
As with most Zoho apps, you can start for free and set up one-on-one meetings  
right away.
■

Vault
We all use a myriad of apps and services every day, each requiring an account, which as 
prehistoric as it may be, requires a username and a password to log in. Until technology 
comes up with a better way of authenticating users, there is no escape from memorizing 
or storing account information somewhere in a secure place.
Fortunately, there are several apps and services such as 1Password, or Keychain 
Access in MacOS that store our passwords for us, so we can spend our precious brain 
power on Candy Crush, or something less disappointing.
For teams and businesses, Zoho Vault promises to alleviate this very challenge 
and make password management easy. Vault manages all your passwords securely and 
centrally, logs you into sites and services without the need for manual password entry, 
allows you to share managed passwords with select team members, monitor usage of 
each password, and grant or deny password access accordingly.

Showtime
If you teach or train people for a living, or just give occasional presentations to a large 
audience, you know how important it is to keep the audience engaged and turn them into 
active participants during a session.
Zoho Showtime builds on this simple but crucial fact and allows you to run a smooth 
show while keeping your audience fully engaged during and after a session. You can 
motivate the audience to express their opinion, run polls, ask questions, and later when 
the session is over, send feedback from and monitor how people engaged with your 
content.
Showtime is a promising and possibly game-changing service for forward-thinking 
trainers. The great news is that it is available for everybody to use, free of charge.

where you can create channels, share documents, and do more in a modern environment 
available on your computer and your mobile phone.

minutes. You will feel quite at home if you have used other tools such as Yammer or Slack.
■

Business Process Apps
Another powerful set of apps that distinguishes the Zoho suite from the competition 
are the business process apps. Using these apps, you can build complex database 
applications to run your entire business, or complement other Zoho apps, such as CRM. 
You can also generate sophisticated business and scientific reports based on standalone 
databases or tie them back to other Zoho apps.

Creator
Zoho Creator is a powerful platform for creating fully customized cloud-based 
applications. If you have a specific set of business requirements that you can’t find in any 
existing tool, or the available solutions are too expensive, too trivial, or too advanced, you 
can quickly create your very own solution with Creator.
One of the things that makes Creator great is that in many cases you don’t need to 
do a single line of coding to make functional apps. Creator offers many tools to program 
and automate your business processes, but for simpler apps, you don’t need to know any 
coding.
Simply drag and drop data fields (text boxes, lists, buttons, etc.) to create forms and 
Zoho Creator will do a lot of magic in the background to turn those forms into a  
full-fledged application.
This book is exclusively about Zoho Creator, so continue to Chapter 2 to start 
learning everything about it.
AppCreator
Another recent addition to the Zoho family, AppCreator allows you to quickly and with 
minimal or no coding create native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows phones 
and tablets.
With AppCreator, you can publish your apps internally within your organization,  
or publicly through one of the app stores.
As of this writing, AppCreator is quite new and available via invitation only.

Reports
If you are into data crunching and analysis and spreadsheets don’t meet your 
requirements anymore, Zoho Reports is a great option to consider. We live in the age 
of big data and data science is talk of the town. A plethora of powerful tools such as R, 
Python, and Tableau are available; however, not everyone needs the data scientist’s 
toolbox.
Zoho Reports is one of the lesser known gems that provides you with a powerful 
toolset for collecting data from multiple sources, performing calculations and analysis, 
collaborating, data visualization, and more.
Using Zoho Reports you can manage millions of records and create business 
intelligence to contribute to the success of your business. You can also integrate it with 
Zoho Creator and other apps and services.
Zoho Reports offers a free edition for you to crunch up to 100,000 records of data, 
plus a number of paid editions for heavier use. If you still rely on spreadsheets for data 
analysis and visualization, I strongly suggest you give Reports a try.

Finance Apps
No business can afford to mismanage its finances. As you might have guessed, Zoho has 
you covered. A number of finance-related apps will help you keep track of your expenses, 
manage complex accounting operations, issue invoices, and streamline how you get paid 
by clients. There is even an app for managing your inventory, albeit, it may not quite fit 
under “finance” category.
Books
Zoho Books is powerful, yet affordable, accounting software in the cloud. With Books, you 
get all the features you (or your accountants) expect from an accounting and bookkeeping 
software, plus a host of other useful features.
You can issue customized invoices and accept online payments via service such as 
PayPal, connect to your bank accounts for automated cash flow and account monitoring, 
create powerful reports that management and clients can understand, track your 
inventory, and let clients see what concerns them during a project.
You can also connect Zoho Books to other apps such as Zoho CRM, Projects, and 
Reports and make them all operate as a big connected system to manage your entire 
business.
To make your life easier, Books offers mobile and smartwatch apps, so you are always 
up to speed with what is happening in your business financially.

Invoice
If you are happy with your current accounting software or don’t need a complete 
accounting software, Zoho Books may not seem so appealing. Sometimes all you need 
as a solopreneur or freelancer is to be able to issue an invoice now and then. In this case, 
Zoho Invoice may just be the answer.
With Invoice, you can define your products and services, add clients, and quickly 
issue estimates and invoices. You can also customize your invoices to your liking and 
include the option to get paid online from within the invoice you send to clients.
Moreover, you can track expenses, set up reminders for your customers to pay you 
on time, and track time for your projects, so you can get paid accurately for the amount of 
work you put in.
The good news is that you can start using Zoho Invoice for free for up to 25 clients 
with all the features available to you.

Subscriptions
If you have recurring billing in your business, for example, you accept monthly payments 
for the subscription site you run, Zoho Subscriptions can take care of the entire backend 
of the payment system for you.
With Subscriptions, you can create your pricing model, automate billing and 
payment management, monitor your payments, and make strategic decisions 
accordingly.
Zoho Subscriptions connects to most of the common payment gateways such as 
PayPal and Stripe, and of course Zoho apps such as CRM and Books, to make your life 
easier.

Expense
Zoho Expense is an affordable and effective way to get your team expense management 
in order.
You can upload receipts for your daily business expenses on the go via a native 
mobile app, which is quite handy for business travelers. Employees can create expense 
reports by entering receipts and importing card transactions, and then submitting the 
expense reports for approval and reimbursement. Accounts will love this way of receiving 
clear and structured information.

IT and Help Desk Apps
Zoho’s IT apps will help organizations that need IT support tools to streamline their 
processes and stay productive. Four apps (as of Spring 2017) will help your IT team 
provide online and remote support and manage IT issues and mobile devices.
Desk
Per Zoho, Desk is the “industry’s first context-aware help desk software.”
Customer-centricity must be at the core of every business, and not degraded to merely 
a fluffy statement in marketing campaigns. Customer experience actually starts before 
customers buy your products or services and continues as long as the customers use them.
Zoho Desk tries to improve the often underwhelming (or worse) experience of 
dealing with help desks. Apart from standard issue tracking and ticket management tools, 
Desk offers a centralized, focused, and contextual interface to support teams to stay on 
top of the tasks in hand and manage incoming inquiries from various channels, such as 
phone and e-mail, efficiently.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
16
Zoho Desk also allows you to create a customer service portal and knowledgebase 
for your customers, from which they can find solutions to common problems, or file and 
manage their tickets to new issues.
Detailed reporting, a mobile app for customer service on the go, and integration with 
other Zoho apps such as CRM and Projects, is also available out of the box.
Even if you are a tiny operation, customer service should still be a key aspect of your 
business culture. That’s how you get loyal customers, repeat business, and referrals.

Assist
Zoho Assist provides an easy way to remotely access computers inside and outside your 
organization for tech-support and troubleshooting.
Zoho Assist is a great tool if you need to show a customer how to do a certain task, or 
better yet, do it for them remotely while they are watching (and hopefully learning). You 
can save time and money and most possibly reduce your carbon footprint by minimizing 
site visits for trivial troubleshooting tasks.
With Zoho Assist, you can also remotely access unattended computers (needs a 
software installed), so you don’t need someone on the other side to give you access. You can 
transfer files, reboot devices remotely, and access multiple monitors on the host machines.
You can start using Zoho Assist for free for basic tasks, so nothing stands between you 
and helping your clients, colleagues, or your mom remotely with troubleshooting tasks. Now 
you can help her bring back that document that magically disappeared from her desktop.

ServiceDesk Plus
For serious IT support, Zoho offers ServiceDesk Plus On-Demand from ManageEngine 
(IT management division of Zoho). It allows you to track and manage IT tickets, resolve 
issues, and maximize end-user satisfaction.
With ServiceDesk Plus, you have various automation options at your disposal, 
self-service portal, out of the box ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) 
workflows, SLA (service level agreement) creation, and a host of other features to ensure 
successful service desk operation for your business.

Human Resources Apps
It is argued that people are a company’s greatest asset. Whether you agree with this 
statement or not, it is important to ensure human resource operations are managed 
properly at all time.
Zoho offers two powerful apps for small to medium businesses (SMBs) to manage 
recruiting fresh blood and smoothly manage the existing workforce.
Recruit
Zoho Recruit is a cloud-based recruitment solution for recruiting agencies and corporate 
HR (Human Resources) departments. You can create and manage job postings, publish 
them on company web site and job boards such as Monster and Indeed, parse resumes, 
manage candidates and communications, and automate tedious HR tasks with workflows.
There is a mobile app for HR ninjas and a free edition for you to give applicant 
tracking and interview scheduling features a try.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Recruit, check out: https://www.zoho.com/

People
As you grow, your team grows too. Usually the moment you pass five employees, HR 
requirements, if not handled properly, start to impact productivity and other business 
processes. So, considering an HR solution early on may be a prudent way to go forward.
On the other hand, for companies larger than 5-10 employees, in-house or 
outsourced HR management will become a necessarily.
Zoho People is a cloud-based HR management service that helps you manage 
all HR-related tasks without losing your mind to needy employees. You can manage 
employee information securely, provide self-service features for managers and staff, 
perform time tracking and attendance, and create performance reviews and other 
important reports about your people.

You can start for free to manage up to five employees with Zoho People. Then as 
you hire more people, possibly through Zoho Recruit, you can upgrade to paid plans and 
utilize all the features that People provides in your HR processes.

Where to Start
As you saw in this chapter, Zoho offers a dizzying list of apps. Most of these apps work 
beautifully together and help you streamline your business and stay more productive.
Some of these apps have overlapping features and it may be confusing to choose 
one if you are just starting with Zoho or are new to SaaS. Therefore, I give a number of 
recommendations that I believe are applicable to many small businesses:
• 
No matter whether you are a solopreneur, a freelancer, or an 
organization of 1,000 employees, start with Zoho CRM. Make 
CRM a part of your day-to-day business process as well as  
long-term growth plans. The free edition is a great place to get 
started. In this book, I cover in detail how to best utilize CRM and 
make it work for your business.
• 
Become more productive by moving your e-mails to Zoho Mail 
for better integration with CRM. Although CRM offers integration 
with Google Apps and Microsoft Outlook, nothing beats native 
compatibility between Zoho apps. One big bonus here is that you 
can host up to 25 users on Mail for free, and that is with your own 
custom domain.
• 
Incorporate Zoho Campaigns as soon as you can. Almost no 
business, no matter how small, can ignore digital marketing. A big 
part of digital marketing is e-mail and social marketing and Zoho 
Campaign will help you win big here.
• 
Get serious about accounting and use either of Zoho Expense, 
Zoho Invoice, or Zoho Books depending on the size of your 
operation.
• 
Zoho Projects should be another key part of your cloud suite. 
With great integration with CRM and Books, you can easily stay 
on top of your projects and manage the operation of your team 
more effectively.
• 
When your team grows and requirements become more complex, 
use Zoho Creator and Zoho Reports for more advanced business 
processes and adapt Zoho Recruit and People to manage human 
resources.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
19
Once you have these apps utilized, you will see how streamlined your processes 
will become and how much time and money you will be saving. Your team and your 
customers will be happier, which means you will be happier too.
Summary
In this chapter, you got a bird’s eye view of the Zoho suite. I hope you see how 
interconnected the Zoho suite apps are and how using as many Zoho apps as possible in 
your business will improve your productivity and save you time and money.
In the next chapter, you will start your journey with Zoho Creator by making a simple 
app and learning some design concepts and best practices in the process.

CHAPTER 2
Fundamentals of Building 
Software
If you love blueberry pie as much as I do, especially when it is served warm accompanied 
by a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, you would care as much about the ingredients, the 
recipe, and the whole experience of enjoying every bite.
Fresh and natural ingredients, an old recipe tested and perfected for decades, an 
experienced baker, and of course the ice cream all decorated on a plate that makes the 
whole desert stand out. Who can resist this?
Good software is like good pie, but much harder to bake. There is not one element 
(ingredients, recipe, or the baker) that can guarantee an outcome that makes users drool.
To make drool-worthy software, everything—from the ingredients (code) and the 
recipe (methodologies and best-practices) to the baker (you, the programmer) and the 
plate (UX)—must be in perfect harmony to make users enjoy using your software, while 
solving their problems.
■
■Note   According to Nielsen Norman Group, user experience (UX) encompasses all 
aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.  
Read more on their web site for the full definition of UX and also how it differs from usability. 
Read more at: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/.
This all sounds nice and delicious, but making good software is hard. I remember 
back in the mid 90s when I was introduced to programming, that you needed to write 
at least a few hundred lines of code for anything mildly interesting to happen. But times 
have changed, mostly for the better.
Throughout time, the complexity of problems computers are expected to solve has 
grown exponentially, but so has the power of computers. There are also a plethora of 
tools and platforms developed to let businesses and individuals solve complex problems 
quicker and automate the few remaining mundane jobs of the 21st Century better.
Today, with platforms such as Zoho Creator, you can practically drag and drop 
building blocks of an application to a form, and Zoho Creator will “magically” create a 
working piece of software to, for example, help you manage your sales transactions.

Chapter 2 ■ Fundamentals of Building Software
22
With Creator, there is no need to write a web application from scratch. Even with 
advanced frameworks, such as Django or Ruby on Rails, an app this simple could take 
hundreds of lines of code and a few days of development and testing.
A Little Bit of History
The magical ability of Creator to make software in a matter of hours was how I was 
introduced to the Zoho suite almost a decade ago.
Back in 2008 when I was in charge of the marketing department of an international 
real estate brand, we had a clunky CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system, 
which everyone loathed and no one used properly.
The CRM quickly became a bottleneck in our day-to-day operations and the company 
started losing valuable sales information. I needed the sales information for strategic and 
tactical marketing activities, so I decided to create software for the sales team. The idea was 
to help them to easily and quickly enter information on the go and then the admin team 
would clean up and transfer the data semi-automatically to the main CRM.
I envisioned a system that was easily available to our 20 salespeople and the admin 
team at all times with centralized data storage. As a former web developer, my natural 
choice was to create a fully web-based software for the job.
However, a quick estimate shattered my dreams. It would have taken me at least a 
month of full-time work to create something usable from concept to launch, but I had a 
department to run and my boss was quite skeptical about the whole idea.
By sheer luck and some help from Google search, I found Zoho Creator, a tool with a 
simple promise that would let me create fully functional web applications with no to little 
coding.
Creator reminded me of Microsoft Access, the legendary database software for 
Windows. Only Zoho Creator was designed for the Internet age.
Four days later, I finished creating a mini CRM for the sales team from scratch using 
only Zoho Creator. The app was multiuser, secure, always available, and provided a  
user-friendly way for the sales team to enter key information on the go.
The app even generated listing data to send to the local media for advertisement, all 
at a click of a button. The team loved the app and used it for a couple of years even after  
I left that company.
Zoho Creator has since grown to be a powerful platform for creating cloud-based 
business applications that can serve thousands of users with almost no IT maintenance 
needed.
Obviously, Creator is not an answer for all problems. There are many scenarios that  
need less or more complex solutions, but having created many complex Creator-based apps,  
I always keep it as an option when I look for tools to meet the requirements of the job at hand.
Getting Started
I can imagine that you are all excited to get to work and create your very first application 
in Zoho Creator. But before you do that, let’s take a step back and remember the pie 
metaphor. You have found the right ingredients (Zoho Creator), and there are reliable 
recipes in this book and online, but how good are you at baking?

Chapter 2 ■ Fundamentals of Building Software
23
If you are a seasoned software engineer or a web developer, you already know about 
data modeling and design, flow charts, UI/UX, and prototyping. But if you just picked up 
this book as your first or second computer book to create software, I highly recommend 
you read this chapter and the additional resources online.
The rest of this chapter is a quick tour of some of the fundamental concepts of 
creating successful software. The aim is to get a taste of these concepts so you can make 
it a habit of using them to ensure a great outcome. You can find a multitude of books and 
online material on each topic, which are a mere Google search away.
It’s All About Data
We live in the information age. It is only natural that some of the biggest problems 
computers help us solve has to do with data. But what is data and how does it concern us 
in our day-to-day business?
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines data as “factual information (such as 
measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation” 
(https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data).
According to some estimates,1 there are 2.7 Zettabytes of digital data (and growing)  
in the world. That is 2.7 billion terabytes. Welcome to the age of big data.
Aside from all the fancy statistics and the jargon, every small business and every 
individual needs to retain and manage a limited set of structured data. Your lists of to do 
items, contacts, inventory, sales orders, and any sort of information you can keep in a 
tabular form of rows and columns is structured data.
Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or Zoho Sheet, are 
examples of applications that can store tabular collections of data and allow users to 
perform complex tasks on the data, such formulas, and charting.
■
■Note   The focus of this book is structured data. In contrast, unstructured data is also 
hot and relatively recent topic. You can read more about it at: https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Unstructured_data.
Table 2-1 shows a simple list of the titles in a small bookshop. Each row contains 
information about a specific book, structured in a particular order, according to the 
columns. This way of structuring information can make it easier to store, manage, and 
use information.
You can easily store hundreds of thousands of titles in one single data table and 
search for books based on each column—for example, to find books that are:
• 
Written by a specific author
• 
Published in a certain year
• 
Categorized under a subject
1https://www.waterfordtechnologies.com/big-data-interesting-facts/.

Chapter 2 ■ Fundamentals of Building Software
24
These structured sets of data are called, not surprisingly, datasets. Software that 
houses and manages collections of datasets are often called databases. Databases 
come in all flavors and sizes. The simple contacts manager on your phone is actually a 
database. It allows you to store, retrieve, and alter data—i.e. your contacts. Your favorite 
spreadsheet software is a database.
However, in a broader sense, a database can be quite complex and with  
sophisticated features to manage thousands upon thousands of rows of information.  
A big chunk of those Zettabytes of information in the cyberspace is stored in a multitude 
of databases in thousands of data centers scattered around the world.
From the users’ perspective, database software is just an interface through which 
they interact with data and solve their problems, e.g., find information, run calculations, 
and generate reports.
However, there is much more boring but important stuff happening behind the 
scenes and it has a lot to do with how the data is structured.
Data Modeling and Database Design
To solve information-related problems and to create software solutions that 
effectively and efficiently manage information, it is crucial to create a properly 
designed database first.
This starts with designing the structure of the data that will be housed in the 
database. This design is actually a conceptual (often visual) representation of how data 
tables will look in a database.
Modeling data prior to creating a database is a must no matter how small the project 
is. This will help you understand how data is stored, what the relationships between 
different pieces are, and how it flows to deliver the expected outcome. It also helps you 
find gaps early on, design optimum structure, and also review and sign off with the 
business (non-technical people who commissioned your work and will eventually use 
your database) to ensure you are on the right track.

■
■Reference  Delve deeper into data modeling by reading articles on 
LearnDataModeling.com. (See http://learndatamodeling.com/blog/data-modeling-
concepts-what-is-data-modeling-data-modeling-overview/).
Data modeling and design is one of the complex topics of computer science. 
You can read many books on the topic and read many articles on methods, tools, and 
best practices. However, for the purpose of this book, the minimum you should be 
doing for each app is think of all the information your app will manage and design 
accordingly.
For instance, in the simple list of the book titles in Table 2-1, the visual 
representation of the table is the first step to determine the key data that needs to be 
stored—Title, Edition, Year, Author, ISBN-10, ISBN-13, Publisher, and Price.
If say, three months down the road, you realize that you missed including the 
number of pages for each book, it will be a difficult job to go back, redesign the table, 
populate missing data for each book, modify the look and feel of the application, change 
reports, etc. It is always better to think ahead and design for the future.

Data Types
The next step is to decide what data type is most suitable for each column. Without 
getting into too much detail, you can store data in computers as two main types—string 
and number. String type (or text) is suitable for storing arbitrary strings of text and 
literal information. So, it is easy to guess that a book title or author name should be 
stored as a string.
On the other hand, the number type allows numeric computation on the  
values stored. For instance, price should be stored as a number so that you can  
run financial computations, such as the total value of the existing books in the 
bookshop.
It is possible to store numbers as strings, especially when you are 100% sure you 
won’t be doing any numeric operations on them. For example, ISBN10 can be stored as a 
string of digits, not a real number, simply because you won’t need to do any summation 
or other numeric operations on it.
Based on this information, the bookstore database has only one table with the 
columns, as indicated in Table 2-2.

There is more to data design than creating mere tables. Concepts, such as 
relationships and normalization, are beyond the scope of this book; however, they are 
essential if you are designing full-fledged databases.
Algorithms and Flowcharts
Arguably everything in the world happens within a process. Something as simple as 
making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is actually a multi-step process.
Processes are more evident in manufacturing and corporate environments where 
efficiency, productivity, and automation are high priorities and need to be modeled and 
improved consistently. The importance of process-thinking expands to the computer 
world where the main goal of most software is to support the business.

Chapter 2 ■ Fundamentals of Building Software
27
Suppose in a simple sales transaction process, all the steps, the people involved, and 
the outputs and inputs of that process need to be identified, so it can be accurately and 
efficiently modeled in a computer program. Forget one step in the process, e.g., sending a 
notification to the accounts, and your software is useless.
In computer science jargon, step-by-step processes or a sequence of actions to 
perform a task, such as calculation, data processing, or performing transactions, are 
called algorithms while their visual representations are called flowcharts and process 
maps.
Figure 2-2 depicts a simple flowchart showing the steps that generate a report based 
on the year a book is published.

Each one of these steps in the flowchart could have processes and sub-processes 
underneath it. For example, the step before Finish, Generate Report, could have multiple 
steps describing how the report will be generated.
■
■Reference  I used Lucidchart (https://www.lucidchart.com/) to draw the flowchart 
in Figure 2-1. It is a powerful cloud-based diagraming tool that you can use for drawing 
virtually many kinds of diagrams.
It is evident that creating visual representations of how a software performs certain 
tasks is useful, as it allows all the steps to be taken into account and enables the project 
team and other stakeholders to review and sign off on each process.
For the purpose of this book, you can rely on simple drawings that logically explain 
various business processes. I still encourage you to learn about business process 
modeling, which helps you tackle more complex scenarios. I briefly talk about business 
process modeling in my other book, Mastering Zoho CRM. You can also read more about 
the topic online to gain basic knowledge.
Users at the Center of It All
Even if you design the best and the most robust database on the planet and create solid 
logic that makes your software tick like an atomic clock, you cannot afford to forget 
the part that has become more important than the others in the recent years: the user 
interface and the user experience.
In a world where there are more than five million apps in two of the largest app 
stores combined (https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-
available-in-leading-app-stores/), the competition is fierce. The look and feel of 
your software and how easy and intuitive it is to use could make or break its success.
Designing engaging software has never been more relevant and the very first step to 
achieve stellar user interface (UI) and user experience is to go back to the drawing board 
and sketch how the UI elements will fit together and interact with each other.
You can use a pen and a piece of paper to sketch the app, which sometimes is exactly 
what you need. You can also opt for one of the many wire framing and mockup apps 
available to give life to your amazing idea.
My personal favorite is MockFlow (https://mockflow.com/), which is a cloud-based 
app. It allows you design wireframes for virtually any platform and create UI interactions 
to roughly show how the app will work.

Chapter 2 ■ Fundamentals of Building Software
29
Figure 2-3 shows MockFlow in action. You can drag and drop the UI element to 
construct windows and forms.
Suppose you are designing an inquiry form. The finished form might look like 
Figure 2-4.

This design prototype shows the type, order, and placement of the elements on the 
form. You can show this to peers, clients, and focus groups to get their buy-in or sign-off 
before designing the actual prototype.

Summary
In this chapter, you took a quick tour of some of the concepts and methodologies you 
need to consider when designing good software, including Zoho Creator apps.
You can start by designing and prototyping breathtaking (and useable) UI and 
then go deeper into creating logic and database, or you can start by designing a robust 
database and then building logic, and finally the UI, based on the underlying design.
The important point is to first take the time and design how the software will look 
and how it works and interact with the users. Fixing half-built software is not easy, nor is it 
pleasant or economically viable.
In the next chapter, you create your very first Zoho Creator App by using the tools 
and components available to you.

CHAPTER 3
Creating Your First 
Application
In the previous chapter, you got a bird’s eye view of the fundamentals of software 
application creation. In this chapter, you get your hands dirty and create your very first 
cloud-based application on the Zoho Creator platform.
Creator provides you with a host of features and capabilities to help you create 
modern, usable, and functional apps in a fraction of the time it takes to build software 
from scratch.
In fact, if you wanted to recreate the simplest app created in Creator in any other 
modern programming language, such as Python or Ruby, it would take you thousands of 
lines of code and many days in testing and deploying your code.
To make it even easier, Creator also offers a set of application templates for most 
commonly used scenarios. These templates are ready-to-use real-life apps, such as 
order management and project management tools, that you can use in your day-to-day 
business dealings.
You can also customize them to match your specific requirements. Not only will 
these templates save you time, but they are also great ways to learn Zoho Creator.
In this chapter, you use one of these templates—a Contact Manager—to start 
learning about Creator and its essential capabilities.
Getting Started
To start with Zoho Creator, open your favorite browser and log on to:  
https://creator.zoho.com/.
I assume that this is your first time here, so before everything, you will create an 
account. This is a universal Zoho account that you can use to access other Zoho services, 
such as CRM, Campaigns, etc.
To create a user ID, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the home page, type in your name, e-mail, and a strong 
password. You do this on the signup form on the right side of 
the page (Figure 3-1).

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
34
■
■Note  Building strong passwords for all your accounts, especially accounts in which you 
keep confidential business information, is paramount. You can use tools, such as Keychain 
Access for Mac OS, lastPass (https://lastpass.com/), or Zoho Vault (https://www.zoho.
com/vault/) to create and manage your strong passwords.
	
2.	
Click on the Sign Up for Free button to initiate the signup 
process. Shortly, you will receive a confirmation e-mail from 
Zoho asking you to confirm your e-mail address.
	
3.	
In the e-mail body, click the Confirm Your Account button. 
Upon successful confirmation, you will be redirected to the 
login page.
	
4.	
On the login page, enter your e-mail address and the 
password you created in Step 1 and click Login.

information about yourself (Figure 3-2). Enter the following 
information:
a.	
Your organization’s name
b.	
Your phone number
c.	
A unique and relevant username
d.	
Your operating time zone
e.	
Your preferred date format
f.	
You can also click Profile Picture and add a profile picture 
to your account.

Take a moment and review the features listed in the details. 
Then click Install this Application to continue. It could take a 
few seconds for the application to set up (Figure 3-6).
Figure 3-6.  Setting up the new application

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application

Once the setup is done, the newly created Contacts application will launch and be 
ready use right away (Figure 3-7).
The app interface is minimal and easy to use. On the left side of the screen there is a 
sidebar with the navigation buttons aligned on top.
This simple app has only two pages:
• 
New Contact—A form in which you can add and store new 
business contact.
• 
All Contacts—Shows a list of all contacts stored in the app. You 
can manage existing contacts in this page, performing tasks such 
as search, view, edit, and delete.
■
■Note   You may notice that your name appears on the bottom of the sidebar. This is a 
shortcut that allows you to access your user profile, log out, and perform a couple of other 
tasks, covered in a later chapter.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application

Adding a New Contact
Now you’ll see how to add your first contact:
	
1.	
With the New Contact page open, enter as much information 
in the relevant boxes as you like, such as Salutation, First 
Name, Last Name, and Phone Number (Figure 3-8).
	
2.	
When you’re finished entering information, click Submit on 
the bottom of the page (you may need to scroll down), or 
simply press Enter on your keyboard. A message will briefly 
appear on top of the screen indicating that the contact was 
added successfully.
After a successful contact entry, the form will be cleared and ready for another 
contact to be entered. Go ahead and add more contacts. Notice that the field validation 
and formatting present for some of the fields, such as phone numbers and e-mails. Data 
validation and formatting ensure the data entered is as clean and as easy to search and 
retrieve as possible.
Searching for Information
One of the essential features of all good software is the ability to search in the information 
stored in it. With the number of contacts growing, browsing through the long list of 
contacts to find the information you are looking for is simply not feasible.
Fortunately, Creator offers powerful search features out-of-the-box. Let’s check a few 
of these features out:
	
1.	
On the sidebar, click on All Contacts. A page will load with a 
list of all the existing contacts (Figure 3-9).
Figure 3-8.  Adding a new contact

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
40
	
2.	
Click on one of the contacts in the list. A contact pane will 
appear on the right side of the page showing all the details of 
the selected contact (Figure 3-10).
On top of this pane, there are five icons that allow the 
following operations:
• 
Edit—To modify the information of the contact
• 
Duplicate—To create another contact with the exact same 
information
• 
Print—To print a copy of the contact on paper
Figure 3-9.  List of all existing contacts
Figure 3-10.  Contact details

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
41
• 
Export to PDF—To save a copy of the contact information to 
a PDF file
• 
Delete—To permanently remove the contact from the app
	
3.	
Click the × on top right of the page to close the pane and go 
back to the Contacts list.
	
4.	
There are three buttons on top right of the screen. Click the 
first one, the magnifier, to open the Search box.
	
5.	
You can search in the contacts based on a number of fields, 
including name, number, and organization name. To find 
all contacts whose first name is John for example, click the 
checkbox in front of First Name and enter “John” in the text 
box appearing below it (Figure 3-11).
Figure 3-11.  Searching for a contact by first name

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
42
	
6.	
Click the Search button at the bottom. The contacts list will 
reload and list only the contacts whose first name is John 
(Figure 3-12).
You will notice that right above the list on the left side, a new Search button appears, 
next to which another button labeled John is displayed. Clicking on either of these will 
show the search form, letting you modify search terms to your liking.
These shortcuts come in handy when you have many records (rows) in the search 
results and more refinement is needed in the search term in order to find the information 
you need. For example, you can combine terms and find all people working for the same 
organization whose birthday is the next month, so you can send birthday cards to their 
e-mail addresses.
To clear out the search terms and have the entire list of contacts, you can either click 
the small red × next to each term or open the search box and uncheck all the terms.
Zoho Creator on the Go
Zoho Creator offers native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile. These 
mobile apps allow you to access all your Creator apps on the go.
Installing the mobile apps is as easy as installing any other app on your phone. 
During the first run, Creator app will ask for your Zoho credentials. Once you are logged 
in, all apps associated with the account will be listed under the Personal Apps, Shared 
Apps, or Workspace Apps. I discuss the latter two categories later, but suffice it to say that 
you can find any app you create yourself, including this little Contacts app, under the 
Personal Apps option (Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-12.  Search results showing the only John in the contacts

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
43
Figure 3-13.  Creator mobile app

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
44
To open the Contacts app, you simply tap on its name in the list.
A minimal and usable version of the app designed specifically for mobile will open 
with all the elements and functionalities of the Contacts app (Figure 3-14).
Figure 3-14.  Mobile version of the Contacts app

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
45
The mobile form is designed in a way that utilizes the little screen real estate 
available on mobile devices as well as the special features available to phones, such as 
taking a photo with the camera to assign as profile picture for a contact.
Again, all of this happened somehow magically for you without you actually 
worrying how the app and its elements will look like on mobile devices. Zoho Creator 
allows you to focus on creating an app that works, without getting entangled in designing 
the user interface elements and losing sleep over degraded user experiences.
Figure 3-15.  The New Contact form on the mobile version
Tapping on the Add New Contact button will open the familiar contact form awaiting 
your input (Figure 3-15).

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
46
Editing the Application
This little contact manager seems powerful enough for many and can certainly manage 
all your business contacts in one place. However, what if you need more, or even fewer, 
features for your specific needs?
As mentioned, the point of using ready-made Creator apps is to be able to quickly 
get started with the essential features and then build on and modify the existing features 
according to your business requirements.
As it happens, there aren’t many requirements for this humble Contacts app:
• 
No personal information is required. The app needs to collect 
only work-related contact information.
• 
No fax number is required. Although some people still put fax 
numbers on their business cards, we refuse to acknowledge such 
technology exists in 2017.
• 
Distinguishing key contacts. When storing multiple contacts from 
the same organization, it is a good idea to indicate which one calls 
the shots or at least influences major decisions.
Now you see how to customize this app:
	
1.	
With the Contacts app open in your browser, click the tool icon 
next to your name on the bottom of the sidebar (Figure 3-16).
Figure 3-16.  Tools context menu

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
47
	
2.	
Click the Edit this Application item in the context menu.  
The app will open in Edit mode (Figure 3-17).
Figure 3-17.  Edit mode
■
■Note  Edit mode is under the hood of your application and is where you can customize 
(almost) all aspects. This means that you may intentionally or unintentionally modify 
elements and behavior, delete features, and worse, data, in the process. Make sure you are 
certain of your actions and take backups before doing so. You will learn about backups later 
in this book.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
48
	
3.	
By default, Edit mode shows the only report in the app—that 
is, the All Contacts list. Ignore this page for a moment and 
click on Dashboard on the sidebar. In the Dashboard page, 
you can see the New Contact form listed on the Forms tab 
(Figure 3-18).
	
4.	
Click on the New Contact form. The form will open in Edit 
mode (Figure 3-19). Apart from the ever-present sidebar on 
the left, the page is divided into three areas:
Figure 3-18.  The Dashboard
Figure 3-19.  New Contact form in Edit mode

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
49
a.	
There is a list of fields on the left side, which you can drag 
and drop on a form. These fields are building blocks that 
offer various ways of inputting, or showing, information 
on a form.
■
■Note  A form is a combination of input elements that allow users to enter specific 
values. When a form is submitted, the values are validated and stored together as a data 
row (or record). A data record (row) is an ordered combination of data fields (columns) 
forming a virtual table. Each table represents a set of information about a specific entity, 
such as Contacts. These concepts will sound familiar if you have used database systems, 
such as MySQL, or spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel. Otherwise, don’t worry. You will 
learn about these concepts in more detail in upcoming chapters.
b.	
In the middle of the page is the form itself, ready to be modified.
c.	
On the right, there is a pane showing the properties of the 
form, or the fields on the form. Clicking on each field will 
show the properties of that particular field, thus allowing 
you to modify it as needed.
If you recall, the first requirement was that the Contacts app doesn’t need to collect 
personal information, so you need to remove the fields that do this:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, select each one of the following fields listed 
under the red text Contact’s Personal Info and click the little 
trash can button appearing next to them. This will remove 
them from the form. Click Yes when you are asked if you really 
want to delete this field (Figure 3-20).
a.	
Personal Email-ID
b.	
Phone
c.	
Mobile
d.	
Website
e.	
Address
f.	
City
g.	
Pin-code

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
50
	
2.	
Remove the red Note field Contact’s Personal Info too.
	
3.	
Remove the Fax field under Contact Work Info.
The end result should look like Figure 3-21. The first and second requirements  
(no personal information and no fax number) are now met.
Figure 3-20.  Confirming removal of fields from the form
Figure 3-21.  Redundant fields removed from the form

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
51
To see the changes in action, run the app by clicking Access This Application. The app 
looks cleaner and unnecessary information is not shown (Figure 3-22).
■
■Note   One caveat of removing fields after saving some information in the app is that 
it will cause the data collected in the removed fields to be lost. In this example, if you have 
stored personal information, or Fax numbers, removing these fields will have caused the 
underlying data to be deleted as well. Adding deleted fields back to the form will not bring 
back the deleted data.
We are not quite done yet and still need to meet the third requirement, which is to 
indicate which contact is the key contact. For this purpose, you can use a checkbox field type.
Follow these steps to add a checkbox to the Add New Contact form:
	
1.	
If the app is not in Edit mode, enter Edit mode by clicking the 
tool icon on the sidebar and selecting Edit This Application in 
the context menu.
	
2.	
In Edit mode, drag a Checkbox field from the fields pane  
(on the left) and drop it between the Department field and 
the IM Contact Info fields (Figure 3-23). A new Checkbox field 
appears on the form with the default name of Checkbox. It 
has three choices (Figure 3-24). Notice the values in the Field 
Properties pane on the right side of the page.
Figure 3-22.  Modified app in action

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
53
	
3.	
With the checkbox fields on the form selected, change Field 
Name under Field Properties to Key Contact. Then change the 
first choice in the Choices to Yes and remove the other two 
choices: CHOICE 2 and Choice 3 (Figure 3-25).
Figure 3-25.  Changing field properties

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
54
	
4.	
Run the app by clicking on the Access This Application button 
on top right of the page. You will see the newly added Key 
Contact field displayed in the form and you can select it for 
any contact that is deemed a key contact (Figure 3-26).
Figure 3-26.  Key Contact checkbox ready to be selected
Great work so far! Now let’s make sure that the Key Contact field is shown in the 
report as well. That way, at a glimpse of an eye, you can see who the key contact is.

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
55
Follow these steps to add the Key Contact field (or column) to the All Contacts report:
	
1.	
Enter Edit mode and click on the Dashboard button on the left 
sidebar. Make sure the Reports tab is selected (Figure 3-27).
Figure 3-27.  List of reports in Edit mode

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
56
	
2.	
Click on All Contacts in the Reports tab. The Report Settings 
page loads with the list of the display columns in the report 
(Figure 3-28).
Figure 3-28.  Reports Settings page

Chapter 3 ■ Creating Your First Application
57
	
3.	
On the list of available columns on the right side of the page, 
find Key Contact and drag it to the middle of the page. Then 
drop it in the empty space after the last column. Key Contact 
will appear in the bottom of the list of display columns 
(Figure 3-29).
	
4.	
Run the app. You can see that the Key Contact column is 
added to the end of the list (Figure 3-30).
Summary
In this chapter, you created your very first Zoho Creator application using one of the 
ready-made apps available in the gallery. You then customized it to your needs and 
learned the basics of forms, reports, search, Edit mode, and fields.
The next chapter delves deeper and builds on the lessons in this chapter.

CHAPTER 4
Adding More Features to 
Your Second Application
In the previous chapter, you created your first application in Zoho Creator by using a 
pre-made contact manager application and slightly customizing it. Working with pre-made 
applications is a very good way to start with Creator. You can learn the basics and best 
practices by looking at how different pieces fit together, tweaking and breaking it while 
referring to Creator help.
This chapter shows you how to create another application—this time from scratch—
and you will learn more about the inner workings of Creator.
A Real Estate Project Inquiry App
Imagine you are working in the marketing department of a real estate development 
company. A new residential tower is about to launch. You speak with your team about 
providing a number of ways for potential buyers to reach your company and inquire 
about the upcoming project.
You suggest creating an inquiry form and placing it on a landing page on your  
web site. Then this landing page will be promoted online to your target audience  
(i.e., potential home buyers) in a three-month-long digital advertisement campaign.
Gathering Requirements
Interested people will click (or tap) on your online ad and land on the inquiry form. They 
will then will fill up the form and submit it back to you, so your sales team can contact 
them, provide more information, and hopefully make a booking.
You find out from your team that the inquiry form needs to collect the contact 
information of the visitors (i.e., leads), their property preferences, and basic information 
about their mortgage plans. The sales and finance departments both need to receive the 
inquiries immediately to be able to contact prospects without wasting any time.
The sales manager tells you that inquiries made via phone calls to the office or sales 
team should also be captured. This means that sales people need access to the inquiry 
form on their computers and phones.

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
60
A last request from the Finance team indicates that they need a custom report for 
mortgage only inquiries.
To recap the requirements, you need an app that:
• 
Is available on desktop, phone, and web environments
• 
Has an inquiry form as the only way of inputting data
• 
Collects the contact information, property preferences, and 
mortgage information of an interested party
• 
Sends submitted information to the sales and finance 
departments
• 
Provides the Finance team with a customized report focused on 
mortgage-related inquiries
Mockup Design
Based on the requirements gathered from the concerned departments, you can work on a 
mockup (or wireframe), which is a rough idea of how the inquiry form should look.
■
■Note   Don’t forget to obtain written agreements about the requirements and the 
mockup before proceeding. This way you ensure that the internal clients (the Sales and 
Finance teams) are on the same page regarding the features and basic elements of the app. 
This will minimize the time spent on needless changes to the app down the road, simply 
caused because the requirements were not defined and communicated to the concerned 
parties properly.
Figure 4-1 shows a mockup of the inquiry form.

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
61
■
■Note   The mockup shown in Figure 4-1 was designed using MockFlow (https://
mockflow.com/). You used MockFlow very lightly in Chapter 2. It’s a good habit to prepare 
a mockup of the app. It gives you a visual representation of the real app so you can share it 
with colleagues and other stakeholders for review and sign-off.
Now that we have the requirements gathered and a mockup ready, let’s get to work 
right away.
Creating a New Application
As mentioned in the beginning of the chapter, you will be creating an app from scratch 
this time. Although Zoho Creator has a host of useful apps to start with, there are times 
when it is easier and better to start from scratch.
This is especially true when you start with a small app, such as the inquiry form 
you’ll be building here, and as your requirements grow, the complexity of the apps grow 
with it too, allowing you to add exactly what you need and avoid using existing features 
that you don’t need.
Figure 4-1.  Inquiry form mockup

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
62
	
2.	
On the My Applications page, click on the (green) New 
Application button on the top-right side of the screen. A list of 
premade apps appears on the screen (Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-2.  Zoho Creator home page (logged in)
Figure 4-3.  Creating a new application
To create an app from scratch, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open Zoho Creator (if you haven’t already) by opening 
http://creator.zoho.com. You will see a list of your 
applications (Figure 4-2).

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
63
	
3.	
Click on the first button, called Create from Scratch. A small dialog 
box opens asking for the name of the new application (Figure 4-4).
Figure 4-4.  Entering a name for the new application
	
4.	
Type in Real Estate Inquiry Form and click Create. A new app 
gets created and will open in Edit mode (Figure 4-5). You used 
Edit mode in the previous chapter. This time, the form (in the 
middle) is empty and is waiting for you to add elements on it.
Figure 4-5.  New application in Edit mode

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
64
	
5.	
First off, on the Form Properties tab (on the right), change the 
Form Title to Inquiry Form. Notice how the next field, Form 
Link Name changes to Inquiry_Form (Figure 4-6). Leave it as it 
is. You will use this value when you start coding (yes, coding!) 
in the upcoming chapters.
Figure 4-6.  Changing the form title
Figure 4-7.  Renaming the textbox
Note  When you change values, such as of the Form Title or Form Link Name, the changes 
are saved automatically. There is no “Save” button in Edit mode in Creator. This is rather 
handy, but be careful you don’t change your values by accident.
	
6.	
Continue by dragging the first element (field) to the form, 
a Single Line textbox, and changing the Field name on the 
Field Properties tab to Your Name (Figure 4-7). The Field 
Deluge Name will also change automatically to Your_Name. 
Leave it as is.

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
65
	
7.	
You want the user to enter the name for every inquiry 
submitted, so you must make it mandatory. Check the 
Mandatory checkbox under Validation. A red asterisk will 
appear next to the textbox label on the form, which indicates 
that it’s a mandatory field (Figure 4-8).
Figure 4-8.  Making the Your Name field mandatory on the form
Figure 4-9.  Adding an e-mail field to the form
	
8.	
Next, add an e-mail field to the form, rename it Your Email, 
and make it mandatory (Figure 4-9).

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
66
	
9.	
Add another text field and name it Your Phone. This one 
doesn’t need to be mandatory (Figure 4-10).
	
10.	
To create a separate section of the form where you ask 
property related questions, add an Add Notes fields to the 
form. A placeholder will appear on the form reading Add your 
Note here… (Figure 4-11).
Figure 4-11.  Add Notes field

67
Figure 4-12.  Adding note as a section separator to the form
	
11.	
Click on the Notes field or on the Notes box on the Field 
Properties tab. A text editor box will appear where you can 
enter formatted text. Enter Property Preferences and click 
the B (for bold) button on the toolbar to make the text bold 
(Figure 4-12). Then click Done to go back to the form.
	
12.	
Now, add a radio field to the form. Radio fields allow users to 
pick only one option from a group of options presented  
to them.
	
13.	
Change the Field Name to Which floors do you prefer?.
	
14.	
Under Choices, enter three choices: 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and  
21 to 30.
	
15.	
Add a fourth choice by clicking on the small plus (+) button 
next the last choice and enter No preference.

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
68
	
16.	
Click on the last choice to have it selected as the default 
option. This means that the users must choose a floor range 
only if they have a preference. The result should look like 
Figure 4-13.
	
17.	
Another way of collecting user input is via checkboxes. They 
allow users to choose multiple options from a list. Add a 
checkbox field to the form.
	
18.	
Change the field name to How many bedrooms do you prefer?.
	
19.	
Add four choices: 0 (Studio), 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 4-14).

Add another radio field, call it Which View do you prefer?, and 
add three choices: Creek, Mountain, and No preference. Select 
the last choice as the default (Figure 4-15).

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
70
	
21.	
Add another Notes field as a separator and change the text to 
Mortgage Information. Make it bold too.
	
22.	
Then add a radio field and call it Will you need a mortgage? 
with three choices: Yes, No, and Not sure yet. None of them 
should be selected as the default. The result should look like 
Figure 4-16.

Figure 4-17.  And yet another radio field
Figure 4-18.  Finally, the last radio field
	
23.	
Add another radio field and call it Is this your first home?. 
Add two obvious choices: Yes and No (Figure 4-17).
	
24.	
Finally, add the final element, which is another radio field. 
Call it Are you considering this apartment as investment 
property? and leave only two choices: Yes and No (Figure 4-18).

Figure 4-19.  Running and testing the app for the first time
Testing the App
The form now has all the data fields required and is ready for a test run. Click the (green) 
Access This Application button on top-right side of the page to run the app.
Fill in the form and click Submit to store the information (Figure 4-19). Add a few 
inquiry forms and see how each field behaves to user input.
You will notice on the left sidebar that a report is automatically created for the 
inquiry form, conveniently called Inquiry Form Report. Click the link on the sidebar. 
The report opens with a tabular list of all the inquiries entered in the app (Figure 4-20).
You can order the list based on any column, filter, and search right out of the box.
Figure 4-20.  Inquiry Form Report

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
73
Adding Basic Logic
Software can behave differently based on user actions (inputs). A simple action would 
be clicking a button, to which a generic software behavior performs an action, such as 
submits a form or opens a window.
In Creator, you can define actions to be performed based on various inputs and 
create complex behaviors that meet your business requirements. This is done by defining 
rules that trigger tasks, which automate actions based on certain logic. In this application, 
for example, you can have the form show or hide certain fields, based on user input, or 
have the application send a notification e-mail every time an inquiry is submitted.
The ability to add logic to your apps is what makes them very powerful; otherwise, 
they would be fancy means of entering and capturing data.
Now let’s add some basic logic (rules, as Creator calls them) to the inquiry form.
To add a new rule to the inquiry form, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click the field called Will you need a mortgage?, 
then on the Field Properties tab, click + New Rule under Rules. 
The New Rule dialog box will appear.
	
2.	
In the dialog box, enter Show Investment Property in the Rule 
Name field and enter a description about what the rule does 
(Figure 4-21).
Figure 4-21.  Adding a new rule

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
74
	
3.	
Scroll down a bit or simply click Add Rule. Under Criteria, 
select Selected Records. Then select Will You Need a Mortgage? 
in the dropdown list, equals in the second dropdown, and 
enter Yes in the value box.
	
4.	
Add other criteria by clicking the gray plus (+) button in front 
of the first one.
	
5.	
Select OR in the dropdown appearing under the first option.
	
6.	
Select Will you need a mortgage? for the first dropdown, 
equals for the second one, and enter Not sure in the value box 
(Figure 4-23).
This means if the user selected either Yes or Not sure when 
asked if they need a mortgage, a task will be performed.
	
7.	
Under Associate Tasks, click the plus (+) button. Enter Show 
Investment Property Field for Task Name, select Show Fields 
in Choose Task dropdown, and select Are you considering this

Showing and hiding fields based on user choice in the previous fields is very 
common and is used to improve usability of crowded forms and prevent users from filling 
in unnecessary information.
Next, you learn to enable e-mail notifications to be sent to sales and finance 
departments when a new inquiry is submitted.
	
1.	
In Edit mode, with the Inquiry Form open, click on the  
Settings (gear) icon and select Notifications ➤ E-mail 
(Figure 4-28).
	
2.	
In the E-mail tab (Figure 4-29), you can compose an e-mail to 
be sent from a specific sender to one or more recipients with a 
set subject and fully customizable body.

3.	
Click on the From field and select Admin User ID. The current 
admin e-mail address will be placed in the box.
	
4.	
Click on the To field and type in a specific recipient for the 
e-mail, in this case the Sales department.
	
5.	
Since you need to send a copy to the Finance team too, add 
their e-mail addresses to the Cc field.
	
6.	
Type in New Inquiry for the Subject field.
	
7.	
In the Message box, you can a message with fields collected 
from the inquiry form. Click on the Insert Fields dropdown 
list on the toolbar of the Message box and select the fields you 
want to include in the message body. The result should look 
like Figure 4-30.
	
8.	
Click Save to store the changes to the e-mail notification.

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
79
For now on, every time a new inquiry is submitted, an e-mail notification with all the 
information about the inquiry form will be sent to the Sales and Finance departments.
EXERCISE
Suppose you need to send different notifications to the Sales and Finance 
departments. The Sales team needs to see the contact information and property 
related fields. The Finance team, on the other hand, needs to receive the contact 
information and the mortgage related fields.
How do you implement this?
Hint: Use the Automation tab under Form Settings and create different sets of tasks 
for when a new record is submitted.
Publishing the Inquiry Form
One of the main requirements of the inquiry form application was for the visitors of your 
landing page to fill it in and submit the form directly on the page.
So far, the apps works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices. You now need to give 
Internet users access to the form. For this, you simply need to publish the form. That is it!
To publish the inquiry form, in Edit mode, open Form Settings ➤ Publish. A message 
will be shown indicating that the form is not published yet (Figure 4-31). Click the Publish 
button to publish the form.
Figure 4-31.  Publishing a form

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
80
Once the form is published, a pane will appear with two tabs—Publish URL and 
Embed URL. Below the link is a preview of how the form will look to the end user. You 
can copy this link under Publish URL (Figure 4-32) and distribute it to anyone. The link 
basically opens a page with the inquiry form in the middle. This is great for sending the 
form via e-mail (or other messaging service), similar to surveys, and asking recipients 
to submit forms easily.
Figure 4-32.  Accessing the Publish URL of a published form
There is also the Embed URL, as shown in Figure 4-33, which is an HTML code 
snippet that you (or your web developer) can use to embed the form in a landing page or 
any web page for that matter.
Figure 4-33.  Accessing the Embed URL of a published form

Chapter 4 ■ Adding More Features to Your Second Application
81
Creating a New Report
One last thing you need to do is design a customized report for the Finance team, so that 
they can easily find relevant information.
To create a new report, follow these steps:
	
1.	
While in Edit mode, on the left sidebar, click the Create New 
button and select Report in the context menu. The New Report 
page opens (Figure 4-34).
	
2.	
Enter Mortgage Team Report in the Report Name.
	
3.	
Select List in the Report Type dropdown list.
	
4.	
Select Inquiry Form in the Report Based on dropdown. 
Another dropdown shows up called Place This Report Under. 
Leave it as is (Figure 4-35).
Figure 4-34.  Creating a new report

82
	
5.	
Click the Selected Records radio button. Criteria boxes appear 
(Figure 4-36).
Figure 4-36.  Choosing to show the selected record in the report

83
	
7.	
Click Create and Customize. The column properties page will  
open and ask you to choose which columns to show in the report  
(Figure 4-38). You can also change the label for each column.
Figure 4-38.  Report column properties page

10.	
From the fields list on the left, drag the Is this your first home? 
field to the Groups box on the right. Also, drag and drop 
Added Time to the Sorting box (Figure 4-41). This will allow 
the inquiry report to be grouped by first-time homebuyers 
and the rest while being sorted according to the time of the 
submission.
	
11.	
Click Next to continue. The Filters page appears (Figure 4-42). 
On this page, you can indicate which columns to filter the 
report on.

13.	
Then click Access This Report to run the report. You can see 
the report opening with customized columns, grouped by the 
first-time homebuyer field and sorted by time of submission 
(Figure 4-44).
You can create many customized reports and provide different views of the same 
data to different target audiences. This is one of the strengths of Zoho Creator.
You start by creating forms that collect structured information via various channels. 
Then you create complex reports, each meeting the needs of specific groups of people or 
departments in the organization.
Summary
In this chapter, you created your send application, this time from scratch, based on the 
requirements collected from a mockup design.
You learned about creating forms, adding and customizing fields, and making your 
app smarter using rules.
You also learned how to make a form available to the world via publishing.
The next chapters cover about security and data access, and then delve into more 
advanced topics, such as workflows and scripting.

CHAPTER 5
Taking Your Application to 
the Next Level
In the previous chapter, you created a simple app sporting a single form and two reports 
to help a real estate company collect potential customer inquiries. The app did a good 
job managing information (it enabled you to add, edit, find, and show information) and 
notifying the sales team upon submission of a new inquiry.
However, a real-life application should perform more than just one task. It should 
help users manage complex datasets and automate daunting tasks. For instance, for a 
real estate company, such an app would maintain all property listings, client, and sales 
information, while providing sophisticated reports to different roles (sales executives, 
managers, etc.) in the company.
Although building complex apps is not easy, Zoho Creator promises that people 
with little to no programming experience can build business apps that address the needs 
of SMEs.
You learned about some of the tools Creator offers to deliver on this promise, such as 
forms and reports. You also learned basic automation.
In this chapter, you continue your journey of making useful apps and learn a few 
more essential skills in the process. You will start dipping your toes into programming 
and learning about Zoho’s easy-to-learn scripting features.
But first, let’s start getting acquainted with the tools.
Deluge
Deluge (Data Enriched Language for the Universal Grid Environment), as Zoho puts it, 
is an online scripting language and is the backbone of Zoho Creator. In fact, if you look 
behind the visual design of a Creator app, all you get is pure Deluge code and nothing else.
If you want to go beyond mere basics and create exciting Creator applications 
suitable for medium to large enterprises, sooner or later you will need to use Deluge.
It is a powerful and easy to learn and use scripting language and in this chapter, you 
will use it a little bit. In the next chapter, you learn more about Deluge.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
90
Listing 5-1 shows a small piece of Deluge code.
Listing 5-1.  A Sample Deluge Code Snippet
on edit
{
  update
  (
    type  = submit
    displayname  =  "Update"
  )
  cancel
  (
    type  = cancel
    displayname  =  "Cancel"
  )
}
For those with previous programming experience, the good news is that Deluge is 
easy to read and easy to learn. For the rest of us, the great news is that most of the time 
you either won’t see the actual code as it remains in the background, or you don’t need 
to write most of it. Creator comes with a user-friendly Code Editor and powerful Script 
Builder. It’s a visual scripting tool that helps you generate code using drag-and-drop 
techniques and requires minimal typing.
You will see some of these in action in a bit and will learn more about it when you 
delve into Deluge in the next chapter.
Form Actions
Creator apps are comprised of forms and reports. The responsibility of collecting data 
from the user is on forms. Forms also contain application and business logic, i.e. the rules 
and interactions that are designed to make the application work as intended.
You (the app developer) can tell the forms how to act or what to do in different 
scenarios. For instance, you can tell the form, when it loads, to populate specific fields 
automatically or to hide some fields if a specific value is entered in another field.
■
■Note   Form actions for DB forms (that store data in CRM) are covered in this chapter. 
To learn about form actions for stateless forms (that don’t store data in Creator), refer to the 
official documentations at https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/form-actions-
stateless-forms.html.
Form actions are triggered for each one of the three data interactions: Add, Edit, and 
Delete. You can tell Creator what to do when a new record is added, or when an existing 
one is modified or deleted.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
91
For each one of these, there are three actions available:
• 
On Load—Triggered when a form loads (opens)
• 
On Validate—Triggered when a form is about to get submitted, 
right before the actual submission
• 
On Success—Triggered when the operation is successfully done
This combination of nine places where you can put your custom code and instruct 
Creator what to do in each situation gives you a lot of flexibility to create complex 
applications. You will see how to use some of these actions in the upcoming sections.
Field Actions
To give you (the developer) more flexibility to control the behavior of your app, Field 
actions allow you to perform tasks at the field level. For instance, you can modify the 
value of a field based on a change in another field, or validate a field before the form gets 
submitted, even before the validation action of the form is called.
Field actions are divided into two types:
• 
On user input script—Triggered every time a user, or another 
script (code), changes the value of a field
• 
On update script—Triggered when the value of a field is updated 
in the database (the app)
Automating Operations
You got a quick look at how automation works in the previous chapter by setting up 
e-mails to be sent to the sales team once an inquiry was submitted by a user. In this 
section, you take a closer look at this important feature.
In Creator, automation is done by using rules and tasks. Tasks are the actions that 
need to be automated (e.g., sending an e-mail) and rules tell Creator to perform the tasks 
(e.g., upon a successful record addition).
Rules can be triggered (executed) in these occasions:
• 
Once a new record is added
• 
Once an existing record is updated
You can specify rules to execute these occasions based on predefined criteria,  
i.e. when a set of conditions is met. Each rule can execute one or more tasks.
There are three types of tasks:
• 
Field tasks allow you to:
• 
Show/hide form elements (fields and buttons)
• 
Enable/disable form elements
• 
Set the value of forms fields

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
92
• 
Form tasks allow you to:
• 
Send e-mails, text messages, or push notifications to  
specific users
• 
Show customized success messages after the form 
submission
• 
Redirect users to a specific URL after form submission
• 
Subform tasks allow you to hide/show the subform
Schedules
Zoho Creator offers yet another powerful tool, the Scheduler, which provides you with 
tools to set automated, timed actions for tasks that need to be repeated at certain intervals.
Scheduler can make an app shine. For example, using a Creator app, it can send daily 
e-mail reporting to the team, send and receive data from external data sources to interact 
with third-party software, and send people in the client database birthday messages on 
their birthdays.
There three types of schedules in Zoho Creator:
• 
Form schedules, which are event schedules based on date/time 
information found in a form, e.g. a birthdate, an appointment 
date, a date range, etc.
• 
Report schedules, which are scheduled based on a report, e.g. 
to send monthly sales reports to an accountant or a weekly list of 
appointments to a doctor.
• 
Custom schedules, which are custom events with set dates and 
intervals, e.g. monthly database cleanup, nightly data import from 
an external source, or meeting reminders.
■
■Note   You’ll see how to use the Report Schedule later in this chapter. To learn more 
about the other types of schedules, refer to the official documentation at: https://www.
zoho.com/creator/help/schedules/scheduler.html.
A Smart(ish) Careers App
To see these automation capabilities in action, you are going to create a simple Careers 
app. The Careers app lists the current job openings at your company and provides job 
applicants with an efficient means to apply for their favorite position.
What sets the Careers app apart from other simple single-form apps is that it has a 
couple of neat features, thanks to Creator’s automation tools. It will ask the applicants 
questions relevant to the job they are applying for, acting as a mini-interview.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
93
Also, if applicants indicate that they have skills that are more interesting to the HR 
department, the app sends an immediate notification to HR, so they can act accordingly.
Finally, it will send a daily report of the applicants to the HR department.
Creating the Careers App
Let’s get to work and create the Careers app.
	
1.	
On the Creator home page (My Applications page), click on 
the New Application button. Then on the Create Application  
page, click Create from Scratch.
	
2.	
Enter Careers in the Enter Application Name  dialog box and 
click Create (Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1.  Creating the new Careers application
	
3.	
In Application Edit mode, add five fields to the form in the form 
designer (Figure 5-2). The five fields are listed in Table 5-1.

Name to knows_Adobe and add three choices, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4.  Adding a radio field to the form
	
6.	
Add a Multi Select field to the form and name it Your Toolbox. 
Then add a few options to the Choices, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5.  Adding a multi-select field to the form

8.	
Run the application by clicking the Access this Application 
button on the top right of the screen. The application works 
and is ready to accept new job applications (Figure 5-7).

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
97
The app works, but there is something that is bothersome. Can you guess what it is? 
Read on to find out what impacts the user experience and how automation can fix it.
Go back to Edit mode after you are finished testing the first iteration of the app.
■
■Note   When building a new app or editing an existing one, run the app often to see how 
the app behaves and if the changes you make turn out as you intended. Switching between 
Edit mode and Run mode often is a simple way of debugging apps and will help you find 
issues as soon as they arise.
Adding Form and Field Actions
The careers app works, but there is a problem. It shows questions irrelevant to the job 
posting selected by the use. For instance, when an applicant applies for the Project 
Manager job, the user can still see the two questions intended for Junior Designer and 
Frontend Developer candidates. This is a design flaw and needs to be addressed.
You can fix this quite easily with Form Actions and by hiding the irrelevant questions 
based on user input.
First, all the questions must be hidden when a form loads. Then relevant question 
must be shown only when users select a job opening in the Applying For dropdown list.
Let’s get to work:
	
1.	
In the form builder (Edit mode), select Form Settings ➤  
On Add ➤ Actions on Load (Figure 5-8).
Figure 5-8.  Opening form actions when the form loads
	
2.	
The Workflow page will open (Figure 5-9). From the left, you 
can see the Creator sidebar, a list of available actions to code 
for, design tools that help you write scripts, and the Code 
Editor (the large whitespace), where you will place/write the 
actual code. Drag a hide|show Construct from the Design Tools 
(under Client Functions) and drop it in the Code Editor.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
98
	
3.	
The code construct appears in the Code Editor. Select hide 
from the dropdown list (Figure 5-10).
Figure 5-9.  Workflow environment
Figure 5-10.  Adding a hide|show code snippet to the code
	
4.	
Then select is_PMP in the field dropdown (Figure 5-11). The 
code should read. hide is_PMP; . This tiny line of code tells 
Creator to (not surprisingly) hide the field called is_PMP in  
the form.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
99
	
5.	
Similarly, place code to hide the other two fields—knows_Adobe 
and Your_toolbox. You can drag and drop Hide|Show Constructs 
or type the corresponding code for each field directly in the Code 
Editor. The result should look like Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-11.  Selecting which field to hide
Figure 5-12.  Writing code to hide the other two fields when the form loads
	
6.	
Now, click on the Save button on the bottom of the page and 
then run the app to see how those three lines of code affected it. 
All questions are hidden when the form first loads (Figure 5-13).

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
100
	
7.	
Return to Edit mode and open the Code Editor by clicking on 
the Workflow button on the left sidebar.
	
8.	
In the form builder, under Field Actions, click on Applying_For 
➤ On User Input. This will open the action that will trigger 
when users select the position they like to apply for.
	
9.	
Drag an If construct from the Design tools and drop it in the 
Code Editor (Figure 5-14). Then select Applying_For in the 
variable dropdown.
Figure 5-13.  Questions are hidden by default when the form loads

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
101
	
10.	
Click on the <opr> in the code and select ==. Then click 
<expression> and type Project Manager. The finished code 
should look like Figure 5-15. This line means that the code 
within the braces will run only if the value of the Applying_For 
field equals “Project Manager” letter by letter.
Figure 5-15.  Writing the condition part of the code
	
11.	
Type the following lines inside the braces, as shown in 
Figure 5-16:

Click the Save  button to apply the changes. Then run the app.
	
15.	
In Run mode, select each one of the three available options in 
Applying For to see how the relevant question appears, while 
other two questions remain hidden (Figure 5-19).

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
104
You just wrote your very first piece of Deluge code and added business logic to your 
Creator app. Congratulations!
EXERCISE
One More Opening
You receive a message from HR that a new position has just opened for a Backend 
Developer, so you need to add this opening to the Careers app.
The opening has two questions that need to be answered by the applicant when 
applying:
•	
“What backend frameworks do you use?”
•	
“What code repositories are you familiar with?”
Add these two questions to the form and write the necessary code to hide and show 
them when appropriate.
Adding Rules and Tasks
So far, this little app provides a dynamic UI that changes based on user input. There is one 
more requirement that needs to be implemented.
The HR department is keen on giving interview priority to Project Managers who 
hold a PMP® certificate. You, as the developer, need to make sure that as soon as an 
applicant submits an application with the PMP question checked, a notification is sent to 
the HR person in charge.
For this, you will use automation rules. Let’s see how this can be done:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, open the Careers form and select Automation 
from the Settings menu (Figure 5-20).
Figure 5-20.  Opening form automation page

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
105
	
2.	
The Automation page opens (Figure 5-21). Under the Rules 
tab, click on the Create Rule button.
Figure 5-21.  Creating a new automation rule
Figure 5-22.  Entering basic details for the rule
Figure 5-23.  Setting when the rule should execute
	
3.	
Under Basic Details, add a Rule Name and Description,  
as shown in Figure 5-22.
	
4.	
Under Execute On, select Add (Figure 5-23). This will cause 
the rule to execute only when a new record (a new job 
application) is added.

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
106
	
5.	
Under Criteria, click the Selected Record radio button. Then 
select Are you a PMP … in the first dropdown list, equals in the 
second one, and true in the third (Figure 5-24).
Figure 5-24.  Choosing the criteria under which the rule will execute

For the new task, enter a task name, then select Email 
Notification for Choose Task. The form will expand showing 
more fields for the e-mail notification (Figure 5-26).

Chapter 5 ■ Taking Your Application to the Next Level
107
	
8.	
Set the From field to ${zoho.loginuserid}, then type the e-mail 
address of the HR person in charge in the To field.
	
9.	
Type in the e-mail Subject.
	
10.	
In the Message body, you can enter formatted text and embed 
field tags, so information about the current record is sent 
in the e-mail body as well. Type in the message shown in 
Figure 5-27.

Adding Schedules
To make this app even more powerful, you will learn how to add a daily reporting 
mechanism that sends a list of all applicants to the HR department via e-mail. This way, 
HR doesn’t need to use the app. Everything is done by e-mail.
Follow these steps to schedule a daily report of the applicants:

e-mails every day until you deactivate it. You can deactivate the schedule by clicking on 
the green dot, which turns it into a gray dot. You can reactivate the schedule by clicking 
on the gray dot.
Summary
In this chapter, you added advanced features to a simple Creator app and turned it into 
(almost) professional-grade software.
Thanks to the Form and Field actions, the app UI dynamically changes based on user 
input. This makes it more intuitive to use. Also, the concerned HR person finds out about 
qualified applicants almost immediately.
Finally, you learned how to send scheduled reports of the applicants to HR every day.
In the next chapter, you will learn more about Deluge, its structure, and its common 
statements.

CHAPTER 6
More Deluge
In the previous chapter, you were introduced to Deluge, Zoho’s data-oriented scripting 
language. Deluge gives Zoho Creator its real power and flexibility to perform complex tasks, 
including automation, data processing, and connecting to external data sources and services.
In this chapter, you get a closer look at Deluge’s building blocks and learn to use 
some of the most common elements of the language.
The Joy of Making Software
Computers were created to help people perform repetitive and complex tasks faster and 
better without having to put in long working hours.
From breaking the Enigma code, to landing humans on the surface of the moon, 
computers were at the center of most of the great achievements of the past century. 
Today, computers transcend beyond the bulky, noisy machines of the past and fit into 
our pockets, fridges, and even in our bodies. Ubiquitous and intertwined with modern 
civilization and pop culture, it is hard to imagine a day without them.
However, a computer, as a machine, needs to be programmed (at least until Skynet 
takes over completely) to perform as intended. A computer program is nothing more than 
a set of instructions that tell the machine to perform various tasks. These instructions can 
be as short as a few lines of code for simple programs, to millions of lines of code in the 
case of complex software (http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/
million-lines-of-code/).
To simplify, a typical computer program does three things: inputs data, processes 
data, and outputs the results. Most programs store data for later use one way or another.
For instance, a simple calculator takes two numbers (input), adds them together 
(processing), and shows the results on the screen (output).
Similarly, although in a much bigger scale, an accounting software, or a CRM, can 
input, process, store, and output data.
Making software programs as a hobby or as a full-time gig is a great joy. Not only 
does it help solve problems of different sizes, it also satisfies the human thirst for 
creativity, creation, and innovation.
However, like any love story, there is an insufferable amount of pain that comes 
with creating good software. You can ask any seasoned software engineer, developer, or 
programmer and they will have a horror story or two in their career that they can share 
with you.

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
114
Reducing the Pain
Creating software requires many skills (in addition to having nerves of steel and a few 
superpowers), one of which is programming. As mentioned, complex software is made of 
thousands upon thousands of lines of code, which means it is time consuming and prone 
to all sorts of errors (bugs).
There are many tools available to make the job of creating software easier, such as 
templates and frameworks; however, you still need to write a considerable amount of code.
There are also tools, such as Microsoft Access and Apple FileMaker, that allow you to 
build data-centric business applications with no or minimal amount of programming.
Similarly, online platforms such as Zoho Creator offer an efficient way of creating 
cloud-based business applications with minimum effort and a high degree of reliability.
Most of these tools, including Zoho Creator, offer the means to write code to address 
more complex scenarios and make your business app more powerful. Zoho Creator’s 
answer to a programming (more accurately, a scripting) language is Deluge.
Getting Started with Deluge
Deluge (Data Enriched Language for the Universal Grid Environment) is Zoho’s 
proprietary scripting language and the backbone of Zoho Creator. In fact, if you export a 
Creator app for archiving or other purposes, all you get is a file containing pure Deluge 
code and nothing else.
Deluge is designed with the average user in mind. Zoho has worked hard to make it 
is as easy as possible to use. Deluge Script Builder is a visual tool built into Creator that 
lets users drag and drop code snippets and speed up the scripting process.
If you are new to programming, fear not—Creator and Deluge will help you build the 
logic you need in your application. If you are experienced in programming, you are in for 
a treat. It is really easy to code in Deluge.
■
■Note   Deluge, with all its power and fun character, is not a full-fledged scripting 
language. It is, by design, focused on getting the work done with minimal fuss and coding. 
If you come from JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or other languages, you will appreciate its 
nimbleness. It’s best if you lower your expectations and give it a chance to grow on you. 
That said, you can connect Creator to the outside world (and your awesome code out there) 
using HTTP requests and Zoho’s REST API.
In terms of syntax, Deluge borrows mostly from JavaScript, but it is simpler and 
easier to understand. It has all the common features of a scripting language, such as 
blocks, operators, control statements, and functions, plus a few extras specific to Creator. 
There are also limited debugging features.

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
115
In general, you can use Deluge to create the following in a Creator app:
• 
Form actions—Change the content of a form at runtime, validate 
data, run tasks before and after a form is submitted, and respond 
to events, such as clicking a button on the form.
• 
Field actions—Change the value of a field on the form, or run 
tasks based on the changes to a field.
• 
Formula fields—Auto calculate values in a field based on a 
specific formula.
• 
Complex filters—Show specific datasets in reports.
• 
Functions: Custom pieces of code that can be called and 
executed multiple times.
• 
Mashups: Send and receive data between Creator and external 
services and applications.
You have used Deluge to create Form and Field actions in the previous chapter. 
Using a few lines of code, you were able to control how various elements on a form 
behave and improve the user experience of the form.
Deluge Names
To refer to various objects (forms, fields, reports, and the application itself) in a Creator 
app, Deluge uses a name for each object. This is called a Deluge Name.
Deluge Names are allocated automatically when you create a new application, or 
new objects, e.g. forms and fields, in an application. When writing code, you refer to these 
objects using their corresponding Deluge Names.
For the application, the Deluge Name can be found on the Settings page. Simply 
switch to Edit mode and click on the Settings icon on the left sidebar. Then find the 
Application Link (Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1.  Deluge Name (application link) of an application

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
116
To see the Deluge Name of a form, in Edit mode, simply find the Form Link Name 
under the Form Properties tab on the right sidebar (Figure 6-2).
Similarly, each field has its own Deluge Name allocated in Field Deluge Name under 
the Field Properties tab (Figure 6-3).
Writing Deluge Code
As you saw in the previous chapter, to write Deluge code, you need to open the Workflow 
page and write code for each Form or Field action (Figure 6-4).
Figure 6-2.  Deluge Name (form link name) of a form
Figure 6-3.  Field Deluge Name

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
117
You can either type the entire code or drag code constructs (e.g., an if statement) 
from the Deluge Task Pane (sidebar with a list of code constructs), drop them into the 
Code Editor, and then add more code to it.
Script Builder
For the “cod-o-phobe” (my made-up word for people who don’t want to touch code), 
there is a more sanitized way, using the Script Builder.
Simply click the Script Builder button on the top toolbar and the editor will change 
face a bit and will no longer let you freely modify code (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-4.  Workflow page
Figure 6-5.  Activating the Script Builder

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
118
If you hover the mouse cursor on a line of code, two icons will appear—one to edit 
that particular line and one to remove it.
Editing any line of code (in Script Builder mode) will bring up a dialog box in which 
you can modify the code in a guided manner (Figure 6-6).
Similarly, when you’re adding a new code construct, e.g., an if statement, Script 
Builder will show a dialog box where you can build the code and then paste it into the rest 
of the code (Figure 6-7).
Figure 6-6.  Modifying code in Script Builder mode
Figure 6-7.  Adding an if statement in Script Builder mode

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
119
Jokes aside, it is a good idea to enable the Script Builder when you are just starting. 
It helps you avoid errors and typos in syntax and code more efficiently in the beginning. 
When you get more comfortable with Deluge, you can switch to free-flow scripting 
(accessible on the toolbar) and get back to typing.
Code Versioning
When you write code, sometimes you make changes that break the code (i.e., cause 
errors or bugs). In those cases, you’ll want to go back in time, see what change caused the 
problem, and roll it back to a previous version.
In the programming world, there are many sophisticated tools that help you 
maintain your code and keep a meticulously accurate history of all the changes.
Fortunately, Creator offers its own simple and easy-to-use alternative, which does 
the job just fine. Every time you press the Save button (while editing code), Creator 
creates a snapshot of the code and adds it to the version history.
To see the previous versions of your code, simply click Version on the top toolbar. 
In the Version History dialog box (Figure 6-8), you can open older versions and copy and 
paste them back into the code.

Basic Elements of the Language
Now, let’s learn about Deluge language elements. You can create a new app and then test 
your knowledge in the workflow area of the default form, or use one of the apps created in 
this book before.
Before we proceed, I want to make honorable mention of a nifty tool by Zoho, called 
Learn Deluge. It’s accessible from https://creator.zoho.com/learndeluge/ (Figure 6-9).
This tool will take you through step-by-step coding practices and provide you with 
an online environment to write and test code. You can also use this tool to practice most 
of the topics you learn about in this chapter.
Data Types
At the core of any computer program there is data, so obviously handing data is one of the 
key elements of any programming language, including Deluge.
Depending on the language, data comes in a number of shapes and forms, i.e. types. 
In Deluge, there are several types of data:
• 
String—Textual data, such as "Vancouver", "Charles Darwin", or 
"Catch 22"
• 
Integer and Decimal—Numeric data, such as 10000, 3.14, or 0
• 
Date and Date-Time—Chronological data such as "2017-07-01", 
"April 13, 1949", or "11/9/34"
Figure 6-9.  Learn Deluge environment

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
121
• 
Boolean—Data that is True or False
• 
List Collection—A collection that can contain values of different 
data types, such as ("2001", "A Space Odyssey", 1968)
• 
Map Collection—A collection of key/value pairs, such as  
{"id": 123, "fname": "Carl", "lname": "Sagan"}.
• 
Form Object—A special data type used to pass to custom 
functions representing a collection of records in a form, such as 
Careers (representing all the records of the Careers form).
Without getting into too many of the technical details, one of the reasons there are 
different data types goes back to the early days of computing, when managing precious 
computer resources, such as processing power and memory space, was very important. Also, 
different data types have their own specific features that help you build better software.
■
■Reference  You will learn about most of these data types in the remainder of this book. 
You can also refer to the official documentations at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/
help/script/deluge-datatypes.html.
Structured Data Types
To manipulate datasets more efficiently, Deluge comes with two types of structured data 
types: lists and maps.
Lists
Lists, similar to single dimensional arrays in math, can hold a collection of values. In 
Deluge, lists can hold values of the same type (e.g., all numbers), or a mix of numbers, 
strings, and other data types.
Here are some examples of lists in Deluge:
Goods = {"Bread", "Cheese", "Eggs", "Milk"};
Prices = {1.3, 3.25, 4.25, 2.99}
Some_List = {True, 3.14, “Tennis”}
Lists have a number of useful functionalities (methods) that allow you to perform 
advanced tasks, such as sorting, adding, removing, and finding elements in a list.
For instance, to get a value at a specific index (position) in the list, you can use the 
get method:
Price = Prices.get(2); //will return 4.25; index start at 0

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
122
■
■Reference  To learn more about lists, refer to the official documentation at: https://
www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/list-manipulations.html and https://www.
zoho.com/creator/help/script/built-in-functions/built-in-function-list.html.
Maps
Maps are similar to lists, except that they are collections of key/value pairs. That means 
that each item in a map has a key by which the value of that item can be referred to.
For instance, if you want to store the goods and their prices, you could use a single map:
Goods_Prices = {"Bread": 1.3, "Cheese": 3.25, "Eggs": 4.25, "Milk": 2.99};
Similar to lists, to access to a specific element in a map, you can use the get 
method, but instead of a numeric index, you will pass the key to the method to find the 
corresponding value:
Price_of_Cheese = Goods_Prices.get("Cheese");
■
■Reference  To learn more about maps, refer to the official documentation at: https://
www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/map-manipulations.html and https://www.
zoho.com/creator/help/script/built-in-functions/built-in-function-map.html.
Variables
So where does all the data go? Computers store data temporarily for processing and 
permanently for storage and later extraction. Variables are used to store data temporarily.
Remember the parameters in Algebraic equations from high school (e.g., 2x + 5 = 9)? 
Variables are much like those parameters, but with the ability to store various data types. 
You can allocate values to Deluge variables and use them in the code as representations 
of the values they hold.
Form Fields and Other Automatically Created Variables
Deluge itself uses variables to send data around in the background in Creator apps. This 
means there are many predefined variables for you to use. When you add a new form to 
the Creator, the form itself and all the fields on it are represented by a variable created 
automatically as soon as the form is created.
For instance, if you add a form called Users to an app and then add three fields for 
first name, last name, and e-mail, Creator will create four variables in that form for the 
form and the three fields on it.
Each of these variables will bear the Deluge Name of the corresponding form or field, 
e.g. Users, First_Name, Last_Name, and Email. These are actually the Deluge Names of 
these components, which you learned about in the previous chapter.

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
123
This is how these fields should appear in the code:
• 
Users, for the form
• 
input.First_Name, for the First_Name field
• 
input.Last_Name, for the Last_Name field
• 
input.Email, for the Email field
The types of these variables will match the types of the respective form fields, i.e. if a 
form field contains a string (e.g., a single-line textbox), the variable will also be of type string.
The extra input. prefix added to each viable name indicates to Creator that this is a 
form field variable.
User-Defined Variables
In addition to the variable created by Creator itself, there are also user-defined variables, 
which are the variables you create when writing action scripts to store temporary values 
in your code.
For instance, if you want to concatenate a first name and last name and to construct 
a full name, you would write a code similar to this:
Full_Name = input.First_Name + " " + input.Last_Name
Full_Name is a user-defined variable and automatically becomes type String because 
at the time of creation, a string value was set to it.
Similarly, if you need to make an Address field out of Street, Postal Code, City, and 
State, you would write:
Address = input.Street + ", " + input.City + ", " + input.State + ",  
" + input.Postal_Code
Deluge System Variables
Deluge also comes equipped with a set of variables that hold key information, such as 
today’s date, the name of the logged in user, and the address (link) of the app itself.
For example, if in an app you want to look for records entered by specific users, 
you should use zoho.loginuser and zoho.loginuserid. Or, if you want to know where 
(geographically) your users connect to your app, you can use zoho.ipaddress.
Here are all Deluge system variables:
• 
zoho.currentdate—Returns the current date.
• 
zoho.currenttime—Returns the current date and time together.
• 
zoho.loginuser—Returns the username of the user currently 
logged into the app. For public apps, this value is null.
• 
zoho.loginuserid—Returns the e-mail address of the user 
currently logged into the app. For public apps, this value is null.

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
124
• 
zoho.adminuser—Returns the username of the admin of the app.
• 
zoho.adminuserid—Returns the e-mail address of the admin of 
the app.
• 
zoho.appname—Returns the name of the current application, 
e.g. careers (for the Careers app).
• 
zoho.appuri:—Returns the URI (Unique Resource Identifier) of 
the current app, e.g. /zohoeducation/careers/.
• 
zoho.ipaddress—Returns the IP address of the current user.

Operators
Operators are a foundational part of any programming language, including Deluge. 
Borrowed mostly from math, operators perform operations that output values based on 
input of one or more other values.
For instance, an addition operation adds two values together and outputs the sum 
of the two. In math and in programming languages, this operation is shown as c = a + b, 
where c is the result of summation of a and b.
Table 6-1 explains the basic Deluge operators.

round(2);

Comments
As you go forward with programming, you will witness that your code grows from a few 
simple lines to hundreds and then thousands of lines of code. The longer the code, the 
harder it is to remember what a specific piece of code does. This is even more severe if 
you come back after a few months to edit the code (to fix an issue or improve it) and find 
yourself lost in the maze of all that code.
A best practice in programming is to add comments to your code as you go forward. 
Comments are blocks of text added to the body of the code that the program doesn’t see 
or use. Comments are read by humans only so they can understand the code that they, or 
someone else, wrote.
In Deluge, because of the nature of Zoho Creator and its minimalist coding, your 
code will not grow that much. However, it is still a good idea to add comments to your 
code and explain your rationale.
To write comments in Deluge, you can simply add a // and write a line of 
explanation. If you want to write multiple lines, you can add // to each line, or group 
them all in a /* */.
Here is how a single line comment looks like:
// This is a comment
show is_PMP;  //show PMP checkbox.
Here is a multiline comment block:
/* This is a multiline comment
Here is another line. You can write as long as you want.
*/

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
126
Here is another, more realistic, example:
//This code hides unnecessary fields on load.
//They will be shown based on the user’s choice of job vacancy.
hide is_PMP;
hide knows_Adobe;
hide Your_toolbox;
I recommend you make it a habit and write descriptive comments; however, don’t 
get carried away. Here are five best practices for commenting your code: https://
improvingsoftware.com/2011/06/27/5-best-practices-for-commenting-your-code/.
Control Statements
When you need to perform a set of tasks only when specific conditions are met, you can 
use control statements.
For example, in a product inquiry form, you want to alert the sales manager if a user 
wants to buy a product within a set time. To translate that into Deluge, you can write:
if (input.Purchase_Decision == "Within 1 month")
{
        sendmail
        [
                to: input.Email_Address
                subject: "Purchasing within a month"
                message: input.First_Name + " is interested in purchasing 
within a month. Follow up more aggressively."
        ]
}
Notice the special structure of a control statement. It starts with an if followed by the 
condition statement in parentheses. The condition statement must evaluate to True for 
the if statement to run the code enclosed in braces { }.
You can make more complex if statements adding else and else if.
Here is a simple example:
if (input.Age_Range == "18 – 24")
{
        hide input.K12_Results;
        show input.High_Scool_Results;
        hide input.University_Results;
}
else if (input.Age_Range == "25 – 34")
{
        hide input.K12_Results;
        hide input.High_Scool_Results;
        show input.University_Results;
}}

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
127
else if (input.Age_Range == "35 – 54")
{
        hide input.K12_Results;
        hide input.High_Scool_Results;
        hide input.University_Results;
}
else
{
        hide input.K12_Results;
        hide input.High_Scool_Results;
        hide input.University_Results;
        show input.Senior;
}
As you can see in the code, you can chain multiple else if statements to get more 
specific with the conditions. Logically, there is only one else statement allowed at the end, 
for all scenarios that don’t fall under either of the previous conditions.
■
■Reference  Read more about control statements in the official documentation at: 
https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/control-statements.html.
Alerting Users
Sometimes you need to display information related to the state of an app, which may not 
be related to data per se, but is important for users to be informed about them.
For instance, a user should be alerted about the successful or unsuccessful 
submission of a form and be given clear indication of why this happened, if necessary.
Deluge has a command, aptly named alert, which simply shows an alert box with a 
custom message (passed as a string value) and an OK button to continue.
Suppose in the Careers app that you want to alert the visitors when a job posting is 
no longer available, when they select an opening that is just been filled (Figure 6-10). You 
would write something along the lines of this:
if (Applying_For == "Project Manager")
{
        alert "Sorry! This job posting is no longer available";
}

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
128
Debugging Apps
When writing code, you need to regularly check the value of different variables and 
outcome of certain statements to make sure that the program behaves as intended. Apps, 
especially when they get complex, may behave undesirably and introduce bugs into the 
code. The more complex an app gets, the harder it becomes to catch and fix these bugs  
(a process called debugging).
You can use an alert to display values while developing the app and remove them 
as you go forward; however, this is clunky and not recommended. There is a better way 
to show internal data while in development mode, and that’s by using Deluge’s info 
command.
The info command will let you output internal values and monitor the flow of the 
program. For instance, if you add the following lines where user input is monitored for 
the Applying_For field, you can check if values are captured properly:
info Applying_For;
info "is_PMP: " + is_PMP + " knows_Adobe: " + knows_Adobe;
When you run the app, a link will appear on the form, called View Log Details, which 
is only visible to you (the app developer). Clicking on this link will open a dialog box and 
the output of all info commands will be shown in order (Figure 6-11).
Figure 6-10.  Alerting the user
Figure 6-11.  Info dialog box

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
129
Once you are done debugging, you can keep the info commands in your code or 
remove them. You can also comment them out, so they are not executed, but you have 
them handy when you need to come back and investigate your code again.
■

official documentation at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/try-catch.html. 
Using exception handling properly will help you create more robust apps.
Data Access
Creator is all about storing and managing data and naturally Deluge comes with a 
number of functions and ways to access the data stored in an app. Using data access 
functions, you can perform the following:
• 
Add, update, and delete records—To create new records and 
update or delete existing ones in code without the interference of 
the user.
• 
Fetch records—To find specific records in a form (dataset) based 
on a given criteria.
• 
Aggregate records—To perform calculations, such as counting 
the number of records or calculating sum or average of specific 
fields in a list of records.
• 
Iterate through records—To go through a set of records one by 
one and interact with each one.
Manipulating data via code is an advanced topic and we will not get into more details 
in here. You can read more about each of these functionalities in the documentation; 
however, be extra careful when working with accessing data programmatically. You may 
perform tasks or introduce bugs that compromise or destroy data.
■
■Reference  To learn more about the data access functionalities of Deluge, refer to the official 
documentation at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/data-access.html.
Functions
Functions are sets of code that collectively perform specific tasks. Most function accept 
parameters, i.e. values, that will be passed to the function to go through the function 
logic.
So far, you have used a number of Deluge functions, maybe without realizing it. 
Methods such as get() in lists and maps are actually functions.

By packing logic in functions, code can be reused and programs look cleaner and 
more manageable.
Suppose you need to calculate taxes for a number of variables throughout the 
program. One way is to repeat the formula every time the calculation is needed, or put 
the formula in a function and call the function every time the calculation is needed. 
This way, you avoid code repetition, which is a programming best practice. Also, if the 
formula changes in the future, all you need to change is the function and all calculations 
throughout your code will be updated without having to change every single one.

https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/functions.html.
Creating Functions
To see how functions look in Deluge, let’s create one. You will learn how to create a 
function called bc_tax() that takes an amount as a parameter (argument) and calculates 
the total sales tax for the item, which is the sum of provincial (PST, 7%) and governmental 
sales taxes (GST, 5%) for the province of British Columbia in Canada.
Follow these steps to create a new function in Creator:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, open the Workflow page. Then click on the 
Functions tab.
	
2.	
If your app has no functions defined you will see an empty 
page with a Create Function button (Figure 6-12). Click on the 
button to proceed.
Figure 6-12.  Functions page for the first time

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
131
	
3.	
On the next screen (Figure 6-13), enter bc_tax for the function 
name and finance for the Namespace (an identifier to group 
similar functions in one category). Then select float in the 
Return Type.
	
4.	
Click on the Add Argument button. Then enter Amount and 
select float for the first argument (Figure 6-14).

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
132
	
5.	
Click Create Function to continue. An empty function with the 
specifications set in the previous section will be created. It’s 
ready for you to create the logic for it (Figure 6-15).
	
6.	
In the function body (Figure 6-16), between the curly braces, 
type return amount * 0.05 + amount * 0.07;. This line 
will calculate the sales tax and return the results as the output 
of the function.
	
7.	
To test the function, click on the Save and Execute buttons at 
the bottom of the page.
	
8.	
In the Execute Script dialog box (Figure 6-17) enter an amount 
and click Submit.

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
133
	
9.	
The result of the script will appear in the dialog box (Figure 6-18). 
The 5% + 7% sales tax is calculated and returned as the result. 
Click Execute to test the function with more numbers and click 
Close when you are done.
Modifying Functions
This little function is quite handy and you can call it whenever you need to calculate sales 
tax for an amount anywhere in the application. However, it could use some improvement.
In the province of British Columbia, there are goods and services that are exempt 
from the provincial tax for a number of reasons. Let’s add the option of including or 
excluding the PST in the bc_tax() function as well.
You will find yourself improving functions and updating their code often. This is 
one of the great benefits of using functions. You change the code once and the logic gets 
updated across the app.
To add the tax exemption item to the bc_tax() function, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the function code by choosing Workflow ➤ Functions ➤ 
finance ➤ bc_tax.
	
2.	
Add a second argument called PST_Exemption of type 
Boolean. This argument will tell the function whether to 
include PST in the calculation.
	
3.	
Add a new line before the return statement:
PST = IF(PST_Exemption, 0, amount * 0.07);
This is a conditional IF statement, and it allows you to skip 
the longer if () {} statement and include the condition and 
action on one line.
This line simply means that the value of variable PST will 
equal 0 if the value of PST_Exemption is true, or will equal 7% 
of the amount if PST_Exemption is false.
Figure 6-18.  Function test results

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
134
	
4.	
To include the PST value, change the return statement to:
return amount * 0.05 + PST;
The result should look like Figure 6-19.
	
5.	
Click Save and the Execute buttons to test the code. This time, 
the second PST_Exemption argument will show up alongside 
the amount.
	
6.	
Click Submit to see the results with PST_Exemption set to true 
and false. Click Close when you are done (Figure 6-21).

135
Calling Functions
Now that this little bc_tax() function has passed the test with flying colors, let’s use it in a 
real app. For this, create a new app that accepts goods items and prices as input:
	
1.	
Create a new Creator app and call it Products.
	
2.	
Add the following fields to the main form. The result should 
look like Figure 6-22.
	
a.	
Item Name: Single line text
	
b.	
Price: Currency
	
c.	
Sales Tax: Currency
	
d.	
Total Price: Formula (Price + Sales_Tax)
Figure 6-21.  Function test results
Figure 6-22.  A new form to test the function

Chapter 6 ■ More Deluge
136
	
3.	
On the Workflow page, add the following line for the On User 
Input action of the Price field (Figure 6-23):
input.Sales_Tax = thisapp.finance.bc_tax(input.Price,input.
Exempt_from_PST);
This will calculate the sales tax of the item using the bc_tax() 
function and update the Sales_Tax field.
	
4.	
Add the same line of code to the On User Input action of the 
Exemption_from_PST field.
	
5.	
Run the app to see the formula in action (Figure 6-24).  
As soon as you change the value in the Price field, the amount 
of the Sales Tax changes too. Checking or unchecking Exempt 
from PST will change the amount of the sales tax as well as 
indicate whether to include or exclude the 7% PST.

the wheel when there are ready-made functions available.
Summary
This chapter delved a bit deeper into the basics of scripting in Deluge. You learned about 
tools provided by Creator to help you write code more efficiently. Then you moved on to 
learn about some of the most commonly used elements of the language.
In the interest of time (and paper), I covered only the essentials here. To go forward 
in your journey with Zoho Creator, the official documentation and the Creator forums will 
help you down the road.
Learning syntax and functionalities of a language is necessary, but that’s not enough 
to become a good programmer. One key point to remember is that writing good code, 
even as lightweight as a few lines in Deluge (or any other language), is not just about 
knowing all the elements of the language by heart.

Programming is a way of thinking, with its own paradigms and best practices. It is 
important to think like a programmer. There are a number of books on the topic (e.g., 
Think Like a Programmer, https://www.nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer). To put it 
simply, if you want to be a good programmer (in any language), adopt these practices:
• 
Put your problem-solving hat on
• 
Embrace trial and error
• 
Always document your code
• 
Write clean and readable code
• 
Never hesitate to ask the online community for help

CHAPTER 7
Building a Complete Real 
Estate Management System
By now you have a good grasp of the essential concepts of building apps in Zoho Creator. 
In this chapter, you are going to put it altogether and build a lightweight real estate 
management application while learning a few new concepts and practices too.
The proposed Real Estate Management System (REMS) will manage four essential 
elements of a typical real estate business:
• 
Listings
• 
Employees
• 
Clients
• 
Bookings
The chapter is divided into five sections that resemble the main phases of creating a 
software solution. Try to follow the same phases, even if briefly, whenever you build apps 
that will be rolled out to other users to improve the chances of success for the solution 
(app) dramatically.
■
■Note   To create business apps ready for prime-time, upgrading to the Standard edition 
of Zoho Creator is a bare minimum. Also, two of the topics discussed in this chapter  
(Roles and Profiles) require features that are only available in the Enterprise edition of Creator. 
Depending on your (or your client’s) current plan, you may need to upgrade to a higher  
(and costlier) edition. To make the best decision or recommendation, make sure you review 
the complete comparison chart of features and limits per edition at: https://www.zoho.com/ 
creator/pricing-comparison-2016.html.

Gathering Requirements
This is where the fun begins. You or someone in your organization, or your client, 
identifies a challenge and need for an information solution of sorts to address these 
challenges.
A Crash Course on Gathering Requirements
According to an article in Code Magazine, “Studies indicate that between 40% and 60% of 
all defects found in software projects can be traced back to errors made while gathering 
requirements” (http://www.codemag.com/Article/0102061).
This is bad news and good news. The good news is that by gathering requirements 
properly, you can increase the chances of success for your business application 
considerably.
In general, gathering requirements is about documenting all the problems the 
software will solve from all stakeholders involved in the project, from the decision-maker 
to the end user.
This is often the job of the business analyst; however, it is common for developers 
to wear a business analyst’s hat. You will need to interview all stakeholders, document 
all the requirements, review the current business processes, and obtain a sign-off from 
stakeholders and project owners. Getting approvals and sign-off at every stage is key to 
protecting everyone involved in the project, especially you.
It is interesting to see that sometimes different stakeholders have different views of 
what the software has to do, or the requirements don’t fully match the current business 
process.
Requirements are often divided into two categories:
• 
Functional—What the application does and how it does it
• 
Non-functional—The user experience (including the look and 
feel) and usability of the application
■

approach-to-requirements-gathering.html) Techniques Used in Business Requirements 
Gathering (http://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/60264-techniques-used-in-
business-requirements-gathering/)
An outcome of this phase would be use cases, which are different scenarios in which 
the application will be used and how users and the application will interact. An example 
is adding a new listing item to the system.

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
143
Another outcome of requirements gathering are user personas, which are 
representations of users and how they will use the application. For example, a 25-year-old 
sales executive who is using the system on her mobile device.

REMS Requirements
Back story: The client is a reputable real estate company with a team of 40 people, 30 
of which are sales executives active in residential and commercial real estate since 1999. 
They approached us for a new development of a real east management system (REMS) 
as their old system is slow and missed some key features.
After agreeing on the project basics, we went on a full-on requirement gathering 
spree and ended up with these high-level findings (I skip through some of the details in 
the interest of time and beautiful trees):
The REMS must be able to perform the following:
• 
Store all data on the cloud securely and be accessible to all users 
at all times without the need for a local server
• 
Provide secure access to various users in different ways:
• 
Salespeople can only add clients and bookings and search in 
all listings and their own clients and bookings
• 
Managers need full access except deletion of the records
• 
Admin must have full access
• 
Manage adding, updating, and deleting listing items, employees, 
clients, and bookings
• 
Provide powerful and easy-to-use search mechanisms
• 
Generate reports of the following:
• 
Master list (property listings)
• 
Current bookings and the pipeline
• 
Monthly and quarterly employee performance
• 
Top 10 clients in a year
• 
Year on year sales performance
• 
Provide a mobile app for salespeople on the go so they can easily 
access information

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
144
Based on this information, we can design use cases personas, such as salespeople 
and mangers, and determine how each one interacts with different parts of the system.
At the end, you must make sure that you have all the documentation in one package 
and have obtained the sign-off of all the stakeholders.
Design
Based on the requirements gathered in the previous section, we must first identify the 
best platform to create the solution with optimum efficiency and performance. It should 
also be future-proof.
We could design the application from scratch using a combination of leading web 
technologies (e.g., a combination of Node.js, Angular JS, and Ionic) to provide maximum 
flexibility and performance in the implementation. But it would take months to develop 
such system and thousands of lines of code. The client is (not surprisingly) in a rush.
Fortunately, you know a platform that can deliver above and beyond what the client 
wants: Zoho Creator. You can fulfill all the requirements of the REMS while providing the 
developer with a rapid development platform. Creator will also offer the flexibility and 
ease of development for future iterations of the REM.
Now that we have our platform selected, you can start designing the app.
Data Model Design
There is an ongoing debate in the software development community (oh, the never-ending 
debates) as to where to start designing software—from the frontend (the UI design and its 
logic) or the backend (the database design and business logic). A quick Google search of 
“frontend or backend first” or similar will prove my point.
In the modern UI-heavy apps, and rightfully so for consumer-oriented apps, UX 
(user experience) is often at the center of software design. You start with creating an 
appealing and intuitive look and feel and then work on the logic and data accordingly.
Zoho Creator takes this to the next level. You start by designing a UI, albeit 
within the constraints of the Creator, and it creates the underlying database for you 
automatically. In fact, in Creator, each form represents a data table that can optionally 
connect to other forms (i.e., a table).
After creating forms (and consequently the underlying tables), all you need to do is 
add business logic and automation, and you will have a functional piece of software.
However, this shouldn’t stop you from thinking objectively about designing an 
optimal data model. You should know exactly what data needs to be stored in the app, 
what the data field types are, and how the data is related.

essays/dataModeling101.html) and Talend (https://www.talend.com/blog/2017/

A Visual Representation of Data
Figure 7-1 is a simplified data diagram that shows data entities (tables, or forms in 
Creator) and their relationships in the REMS application.
■
■Note   I made the diagram in Figure 7-1 in Lucidchart (https://www.lucidchart.com/),  
which is a powerful cloud-based diagraming tool. I am not affiliated with them in any way.  
I just enjoy their product and recommend you giving it a try too.
There are four data entities in the REMS, which will turn into Creator forms:
• 
Employees
• 
Listings
• 
Clients
• 
Bookings
Each one of these entities will store its corresponding records. Each record will have 
the fields shown in Figure 7-1.
You can see that there are relationships connecting entities to each other. For example, 
a Client record can have a related Employee record. This is a direct translation from how a 
real estate business operates, meaning that leads and contacts (clients) each belong to an 
employee to make sure clients are taken care of and commissions are paid out fairly.

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System

The reason that we don’t put employee information in the same place as the clients 
is that if, for example, one employee has multiple clients (which is usually the case), we 
won’t need to repeat all the employee information (ID, First Name, Last Name, etc.) for 
each client record over and over again.
■
■Reference   Separating the data model into different entities is a best practice in data 
design and is called normalization. The topic is beyond the scope of this book; however, 
you can read about the concept in many resources, including Agile Data at: http://www.
agiledata.org/essays/relationalDatabases.html and http://agiledata.org/
essays/dataNormalization.html.
User Interface Design
This is where the fun begins. You get to design the look and feel of your masterpiece and 
make it as engaging and pleasant as possible for the users to interact with your app.
“A happy customer tells a friend; an unhappy customer tells the world.”
—Source Unknown
I can’t emphasize enough that the user is royalty and should be treated as such. So, it 
is paramount that every element of the UI be designed with the user in mind.
UI design is not easy. In fact, I would argue that it is harder than designing databases 
and writing code. The reason is that the UI is the part of the software that the user can see 
and use, so it’s vulnerable to misuse and critique.
Although in Creator you are limited by its design elements and there is not wiggle 
room (thankfully, sometimes), there are still points that you need to keep in mind,  
such as:
• 
Choosing the right labels for fields
• 
Placing fields on forms in the optimum and logical order
• 
Enabling the right data validation and formatting mechanisms
• 
Designing reports that are easy to understand
• 
Displaying messages that provide users with easy-to-follow 
instructions
■
■ Reference   There are virtually endless resources for learning UX and UI design. A 
good place to start are the courses offered by Coursera at: https://www.coursera.org/
courses?_facet_changed_=true&domains=computer-science&languages=en&query=ux.

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
147
UI Mockups
You might remember from Chapter 4 that we used Mockflow to design the UI schematic. 
Having mockups prepared before the implementation phase and obtaining sign-off will 
make the lives of everyone on the project (including you) easier.
Figure 7-2 shows a mockup design of the Employees form.
MORE MOCKUPS
Design three more mockups for the other forms:
•	
Listings
•	
Clients
•	
Bookings
You can also create mockups for the reports.
Figure 7-2.  A mockup design of the Employees form

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
148
Implementation
Now that you have designed the data model and the UI, you can start building. Let’s start 
with creating the app itself and all the forms and data relationships.
Then you will make it easier for your users to access the app elements by rearranging 
the sidebar. After that, you’ll see how to configure sharing and data access levels. You will 
continue customizing existing reports and adding new ones. Finally, you will tap into the 
power of pages and add create a listing exposé (a factsheet).
Creating the App
As a refresher, to create the REMS, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Zoho Creator home page, click on the New Application 
button (Figure 7-3).
Figure 7-3.  Zoho Creator home page (logged in)

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
149
	
2.	
Enter REMS in the Application Name dialog box (Figure 7-4) 
and click Create.
Creating Forms
You will be creating four forms for the REMS app:
• 
Employees
• 
Listings
• 
Clients
• 
Bookings
By now, you are well versed in creating forms, so this section doesn’t get into 
much detail. However, I review each form and make sure all the elements are added as 
mentioned here.
Employees Form
The REMS app opens in Edit mode with a default form named Untitled ready to be 
modified.

Rename the form Employees and add the fields listed in Table 7-1 to it.
The resulting form should look like Figure 7-5.

It is recommended that you run the app often, especially after adding a form or other 
elements. This will help you make sure the app is being built as per the envisioned design 
and all pieces work as intended.
Figure 7-6 shows the Employees form in action.
You can add records and check the data entered through the form in the 
automatically created employees report (Figure 7-7).
You will learn how to customize reports and add new one later in this chapter.
You can now go back to Edit mode and continue adding the remaining forms.

Clients Form
Similar to the Employees form, you need to create a new form for the clients:
	
1.	
Click on the Create button on the left sidebar and choose 
Form from the context menu.
	
2.	
Populate the New Form dialog as shown in Figure 7-8 and 
then click Create to proceed.
	
3.	
On the Clients form, add the fields listed in Table 7-2.
	
4.	
For the Broker ID field, you need to load the names of the 
employees from the Employees form. Drag a Lookup field on 
to the form. The Create Lookup Relation dialog box will open.

Run the app and test the Clients form. Add a few clients and make sure the form 
works as intended. See how you can add a Broker (employee) to a new client.
After testing the form, go back to Edit mode.
Listings Form
Continue by designing the Listings form. This is the largest form in the app and has 
(almost) all the information necessary for a property listing.
Follow these steps to create the Listings form:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click the Create button on the left sidebar and 
choose Form from the context menu.
	
2.	
Fill in the New Form (Figure 7-12) and click Create to 
continue.

Use a radio button field for the Bedrooms (and later, 
Bathroom) fields. Add the options as shown in Figure 7-13.
	
5.	
Finish by adding a Broker field similar to the Clients form. The 
resulting form should look like Figure 7-14.

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
157
Bookings Form
There is one more form to create, called Bookings. The Bookings form is used when a 
property (listing) is booked by a client. It should collect the information of three different 
entities:
• 
The subject property, coming from the Listings form
• 
The seller, coming from the Clients form
• 
The buyer, coming from the Clients form
To create the Bookings form, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click the Create button on the left sidebar and 
choose Form from the context menu.
	
2.	
Fill in the New Form (Figure 7-15) and click Create to 
continue.

4.	
For the Buyer’s Name and Seller’s Name fields, add Lookup 
fields that load information from the Clients form (Figure 7-16).
	
5.	
Configure Display Properties for both of these fields, so they 
show the first name and last name in order.
	
6.	
For the Subject Property field, add a Lookup field connected to 
the Listings form (Figure 7-17).
Figure 7-16.  Connecting buyers and sellers from the Clients form

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
159
	
7.	
Update the Display Fields for the Subject Property to show 
both Property Title and Reference Code separated by - .
The resulting form should look like Figure 7-18.
All the forms are created. Run the app and test the fields, lookups, and other 
elements. Then pour yourself cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage) and return to Edit 
mode to work on the app. You still have a lot to do.
Rearranging the Sidebar
While running Creator apps, you might have noticed that in the navigation sidebar forms, 
their corresponding reports are grouped together in separate sections for each form/
report pair.
This is not optimal for all scenarios and can get confusing when mixing forms and 
reports together. You can change this and rearrange the sidebar in a way that is suitable 
for your users.
Figure 7-18.  The Bookings form is complete

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
160
For the REMS app, you’ll put all the reports in a separate section. Also, as you will 
see later in this chapter, you can limit access to the Employees form and report, so only 
the admin users can access them. You will put these two under a separate section too.
Let’s get started:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click Settings on the sidebar. Then click 
Sections on the left tab bar. The current sections will be 
shown (Figure 7-19).
	
2.	
Click the New Section button on the top-right side of the page 
and type Reports in the dialog box (Figure 7-20).
Figure 7-19.  App navigation sections and items
Figure 7-20.  Adding a new section

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
161
	
3.	
Click Save to add the new section. It will appear at the bottom 
of the page (Figure 7-21).
	
4.	
Drag and drop all the reports from other sections to the 
Reports section. You can order them in the section.
	
5.	
You can add another section and call it Admin to put the 
Employee form and Report link there. There is an easier way 
though—simply click on the little Edit icon on the Employees 
section and rename the Section Name and the Section Link 
Name to Admin.
Figure 7-21.  Newly created Reports section

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
162
The result should look like Figure 7-22.
Now if you run the app, you will see the links rearranged nicely on the sidebar.
Reports
There are four reports generated automatically, one for each form in the app:
• 
Employees report
• 
Clients report
• 
Listings report
• 
Booking report
Each of these is simply a list of all the records available in each form. As you saw in 
previous chapters, Creator reports offer a host of features, such as filters, sorting, and 
search. Users can also export and print reports if they have enough permissions.
Figure 7-22.  Rearranged sections

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
163
There are editing and addition features available by default—again, they are visible 
depending on the permission level of the users.
You can customize pretty much everything about a report. You can:
• 
Add, remove, and reorder columns
• 
Narrow down the results based on set criteria
• 
Limit access to information using permissions
• 
Change the report format to list, sheet, summary, or chart
For this REMS app, you need two new reports—a list of properties grouped by 
property type and a visualization of the listings based on a number of fields.
Creating a List Report
To create a new report showing all the listings grouped by property type, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click on Create New in the sidebar and then 
select Report from the context menu.
	
2.	
Fill in the New Report page, as shown in Figure 7-23. Then 
click Create and Customize to continue.
	
3.	
On the Grouping and Sorting tab of the Report Settings page, 
drag the Property Type field from the field list on the left and 
drop it into Grouping on the right.
Figure 7-23.  Creating a new report

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
164
	
4.	
Then drag and drop the Bedrooms and Bathrooms fields to 
Sorting. The result should look like Figure 7-24.
	
5.	
Click Next to continue.
	
6.	
On the next screen, enable Auto Filters for Bathrooms, 
Bedrooms, and Property Type (Figure 7-25). Click Finish to 
complete the process.
Figure 7-24.  Customizing the grouping and sorting of the new report
Figure 7-25.  Enabling Auto Filters for three fields

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
165
	
7.	
Run the app and check the newly created Listing By Property 
Type report (Figure 7-26). The entire listing is divided into 
groups based on the Property Type field.
	
8.	
Click on the Filter (funnel icon) button on the top-right of the 
screen. Notice the fields with auto filter enabled are listed for 
quick selection. 
■
■Tip   The listing data shown in Figure 7-26 is created via a useful online tool, 
generatedata.com, and then imported into the REMS app. You can create virtually any kind 
of dummy datasets for testing purposes.

Visualizing Data
Data visualization is one of the top trends of the past couple of years. We live in an era in 
which information is a ubiquitous and inseparable part of human civilization.
Terabytes of information are created by humans and machines every single day 
(https://analyticsweek.com/content/big-data-facts/) and the ability to make 
sense of data has become a must for any organization that wants to stay relevant. 
Possessing the right information and generating human-digestible business intelligence 
are the biggest assets (or weapons) at the disposal of winners. At least until the machines 
take over completely.
This little app can generate important information. For instance, you as a decision 
maker of a successful real estate company want to understand market trends and stay 
competitive. You can easily visualize otherwise dizzying rows of data.
Fortunately, Zoho Creator offers decent charting features. You can turn textual and 
numeric values into useful charts and share them with internal users and the outside world.
■
■Note   If your data analysis and reporting requirements exceed the limits of Zoho 
Creator, you might want to check out Zoho Reports (https://www.zoho.com/reports/
features.html). It offers a host of advanced features for large datasets and is integrated 
well with Creator.
To create a chart that shows market trends in terms of distribution of different types 
of properties based on size and price, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Create a new report for the Listings form with the information 
shown in Figure 7-27. Choose Pivot Chart as the report type.
Figure 7-27.  Creating a chart report

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
167
	
2.	
Familiarize yourself with the chart designer (Figure 7-28). On 
the left is the list of available fields. In the middle, you can set 
graph axes and other elements. On the top, you can choose 
from different types of charts.
	
3.	
Referring to Figure 7-29, add four fields to the chart:
	
a.	
Drag the Area field and drop it into the X-Axis box. Select 
Actual(M) in the field option dropdown.
	
b.	
Drag the Selling Price field and drop it into the Y-Axis box. 
Select Sum in the field option dropdown.
	
c.	
Drag Property Type and drop it into the Color box. Select 
Actual in the field option dropdown.
	
d.	
Drag Bedrooms and drop it into the Text box. Select 
Actual in the field option dropdown.
Figure 7-28.  Chart designer

Experiment by moving fields around and changing the field 
options. Check the results in the chart preview.

Figure 7-30.  Adding filters to the chart
	
5.	
Click the Filters tab and drag and drop Broker to the Filters 
box. Then select one or more brokers and see how the results 
on the chart change based on your selections (Figure 7-30).

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
170
	
6.	
Click Save to finish creating the chart and run the app to see 
the chart in action (Figure 7-31).
Publishing Charts
The result of the Listings Visualization chart (report) is quite informative and is not 
giving away trade secrets. It would be a good idea to share this with the world and attract 
potential customers.
To publish a chart, open it in Edit mode and click the Publish button. Then confirm 
the procedure. You will be given two options to share the chart (Figure 7-32):
• 
A Publish URL, which just opens the chart in a standalone  
web page
• 
An HTML (IFRAME) snippet to embed in any web page
Figure 7-31.  The Listing Visualization chart in action

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System

EXPLORE REPORTS
There is more to reports. Change the report and chart types and see which one fits 
the requirements of the application better.
Also, open Visibility and Settings using the corresponding button on top of the page 
and customize the reports even further.
Pages
One of the more powerful features of Creator is the Pages feature, which allows you to 
create complex interfaces for your app beyond forms and reports.
Pages are essentially HTML pages with the capability of showing dynamic content 
directly from the data stored in Creator. They give you a great level of flexibility in what 
can go on a page.
You can mix elements from forms, reports, and other internal and external web 
pages, creating dashboards, invoices, and other elements.
Creating an Exposé Page
One of the common documents used in a real estate company is an exposé or factsheet of 
listing items. Realtors share these documents with potential customers to provide them 
with a summary of key information.
Although the REMS app has a number of reports, none of them is suitable as an 
exposé. You can use the Pages feature of Creator to generate them for each listing item.
Figure 7-32.  Publishing the Listings Visualization chart

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
172
■
■Note   Creating pages requires intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS. Head to 
W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com) or pick up an HTML/CSS book (http://www.
apress.com/gp/search?facet-subj=subj__i29050&query=HTML%2FCSS) if these are not 
your forte. Alternatively, you can seek external help from web designers.
Figure 7-33 shows a wireframe of how the exposé should look. We will try to create a 
page as close as possible to this wireframe.
Figure 7-33.  The conceptual design of the exposé

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
173
You’ll now create your first Creator page:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, click Create New on the sidebar and then select 
Page from the context menu.
	
2.	
Name the new page Expose and place it under the Reports 
section (Figure 7-34).
	
3.	
Click Create to proceed. The new page will open for editing in 
the Script Builder (Figure 7-35).
Figure 7-34.  Creating a new page
Figure 7-35.  Newly created page opens in Script Builder

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
174
	
4.	
Click the Click to Add New Parameters link on top-left side 
of the page. Then type listing_id and click Done in the Add 
Parameters dialog box (Figure 7-36). You will use this URL 
parameter later to tell the page which listing item to use to 
show information.
	
5.	
Switch to Free Flow Script. The underlying code will be shown 
(Figure 7-37). Between the curly brackets in Lines 4 and 6, you 
will write all the code.
Figure 7-36.  Adding an URL parameter
Figure 7-37.  The skeleton (Deluge) code of the new page

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
175
	
6.	
First, you need to load the data to be displayed on the page, 
i.e. a listing item. Add this line of code right after the opening 
curly bracket:
listing = Listings[Reference_Code == listing_id];
This line loads the record with Reference_Code indicated 
in the URL parameter, listing_id, and stores it in the listing 
variable.
	
7.	
With the data loaded and available, it is time to display the 
data. Add the following lines after the previous line:
<%= listing.Property_Title %>
<%= listing.Reference_Code %>
<%= listing.Property_Type %>
<%= listing.Area_m2 %>
<%= listing.Bedrooms %>
<%= listing.Bathrooms %>
<%= listing.Address %>
<%= listing.Offer_Price; %>
■
■Note  Notice the peculiar tag <%= %>. This tag is used to embed dynamic  
results generated by code directly into the body of a page. For example, the line  
listing.Property_Title gets the property title of a listing record. Putting it into the  
<%= %> tags simply places the value wherever in the page the tags are placed. The <% %>, 
on the other hand, just encloses code that doesn’t have output to the page.
	
8.	
To test the code, click on the Preview button on the top-right 
of the page.
	
9.	
A dialog box will appear asking you to enter a value for the 
listing_id URL parameter. Enter a reference code from an 
existing record in the Listings and click Submit.
	
10.	
The page will open in preview mode and you can see the 
results of the code you just entered (Figure 7-38). You can 
see that the field values are displayed, but it lacks context 
and needs major formatting. HTML and CSS to the rescue.
Figure 7-38.  Results of the first code are not impressive

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
176
	
11.	
Type in the code in Listing 7-1. This code adds the basic 
HTML skeleton as well as some static sample content. It also 
places the field values (indicated in bold) in the right places, 
so the page looks formatted and is usable.

The important point here to see how this page template works 
and how it mixes HTML, CSS, and Deluge.
	
12.	
Preview the page again. Oh, the difference (Figure 7-39). 
Although not a show stopper, the page looks more appealing 
and the information is properly placed.
Figure 7-39.  Thanks to a dash of HTML and CSS, the page looks much better now

The next step is to add a feature image (or more) to the page. 
Go back and add the following code (Listing 7-2) after the 
closing </tr> in Line 21.

<tr id="feature_image">

      img = img.replaceFirst("fieldName", listing.ID + "Photo");
      img = img.replaceFirst("image", "image-download");
      img = img.replaceFirst(">", "style='width:100%'");
    %>
    <%=img%>
  </td>
</tr>
■
■Note   You might be as puzzled as I am about the code in Listing 7-2, but you can’t 
simply show listing.Photo. Creator, for reasons unknown to me, stores the whole <img> 
tag instead of a simple URI to the image file. To make it worse, the URI is wrong and needs 
to be reconstructed correctly. This tiny hack may not work in the future if Zoho opts to take a 
less annoying route to store images. So, be on the lookout and fix your code accordingly.
	
14.	
Save and preview the page. The feature image will be 
displayed on the page (Figure 7-40).

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
179
Using the Page
If you run the app and click on Exposé on the Reports sidebar, you will receive an error 
in executing the page: “Value is empty and ‘replaceFirst’ function cannot be applied 
Line:(24)”.
This is simply because merely opening the page will not pass the required listing_id 
parameter to the code, resulting in the error.
You need to add the following bit to the Exposé page URL and pass a reference code 
along with it to:
?listing_id=<Reference_Code>
One way is to add an URL field to the Listings form that stores the link to the Exposé 
page matching the listing and then show that URL field in the reports, so users can open it 
with a simple click.
Figure 7-40.  The formatted exposé with a featured image

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
180
Let’s see how to do this:
	
1.	
Open the Listings form in Edit mode.
	
2.	
In the Listings form (Figure 7-41):
	
a.	
Add an URL field to the form.
	
b.	
Rename it Expose Link.
	
c.	
Under URL Options, enable Link Name and Title.
	
d.	
Change Show Field To to Admin Only.
	
3.	
Open the workflow area and add the following code to the On 
User Input action of the Reference Code field (Figure 7-42):
link = trim(input.Reference_Code); //ensures no white 
space around the code
input.Expose_Link = "<a target='_blank' 
href='https://app.zohocreator.com/zohoeducation/
rems/#Page:Expose?listing_id=" + link + "'>" + link + 
"</a>";
This way, whenever a user changes the reference code, the 
corresponding URL to the Exposé page will be updated too.
Figure 7-41.  Adding an URL field to the Listings form

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
181
	
4.	
Click Save and then move to the Listing By Property Type report.
	
5.	
In the Column tab, add an Expose Link field to the report as 
the last column. This will enable the view to show the URL 
title link to the URL, which opens the exposé for a specific 
record.
	
6.	
Move to the Settings page. In the Sections tab, add a new 
section called Hidden.
	
7.	
Move the Exposé item to the Hidden section. Then click on the 
Show/Hide link to hide the Hidden section from the users in 
the runtime (Figure 7-43). This is because you don’t want the 
users to open the Exposé page directly and cause an error.
Figure 7-42.  Dynamically constructing an URL for listing as a link to their respective 
Exposé page
Figure 7-43.  Adding a new hidden section to hide the direct link to the Exposé page

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
182
	
8.	
Now, run the app and open the Listings By Property Type 
report.
	
9.	
Edit one of the records and change the reference code for it. 
The Expose Link column will populate with a title and an URL.
	
10.	
Save the changes. You will be redirected back to the report. 
Notice the updated reference code and the populated Expose 
Link fields (Figure 7-44). Clicking on these links will open 
their Exposé pages.
Security and Access Management
Creator apps are private by default, meaning only the app developer (admin) can access 
them. But what is the point of an app if you can’t share the goodness with others?
Creator offers robust and easy-to-configure sharing and security features. You can 
add users, roles, profiles, and groups that resemble your organizational chart. Then 
you can define who accesses each element of the app according to accountability and 
clearance level of each user, role, profile, or group.
■
■Note   The subject of data sharing and data security must be treated as high-priority in 
all business apps. Make sure you collect accurate sharing and data access level rules and 
policies in the requirement-gathering phase and get sign-off from the stakeholders.
Figure 7-44.  The Expose link added to the report linking to the corresponding Exposé page

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
183
Creating Roles
Each Creator user must belong to a role and a profile. By default, there are three roles 
defined in the system:
• 
CEO
• 
Manager
• 
Employee
Roles are arranged in a hierarchy to resemble the organizational chart of a company. 
This helps with reporting and data sharing mechanisms.
There are also two default profiles:
• 
Administrator
• 
User
The first user (you) is set automatically by Creator to CEO and Administrator for 
highest permission levels.
For the REMS app, you need one more role for the sales director, called Director.
Follow these steps to create the Director role:
	
1.	
In Edit mode, open the Settings page and select the Users & 
Permissions tab.
	
2.	
Click on the Roles tab (top). Then click on the New Role 
button.
	
3.	
In the New Role dialog box (Figure 7-45), enter Director in the 
Role Name field and CEO in the Reports To field. Click Save to 
continue.
Figure 7-45.  Adding a new role

Chapter 7 ■ Building a Complete Real Estate Management System
184
	
4.	
With a new director in town, the existing Manager role 
should report directly to the director. In the Roles page, click 
on Manager to open the Edit Role form (Figure 7-46). Then 
change Reports To to Director.
	
5.	
Click Save to apply the changes. The new reporting structure 
is shown in Figure 7-47.
Adding Users
You can add, edit, and remove users either from within an app, or in the general Setup 
area of the Zoho Creator. In both cases, these users will count toward the total number of 
users available to your Creator account. So, depending on your plan, you might need to 
pay for every additional user.

To add new users to the app, follow these steps:

Creating a Group
Groups will make it easier to share apps and their elements with a group of users who all 
have similar data access requirements. You can share all or parts of an app with a group 
and all the existing and future users in that group will gain equal access to the app.
For the REMS app, you need a Sales Team group so that you can easily manage data 
sharing for all the members of the sales team.
Follow these steps to create a new group:
	
1.	
Choose Home ➤ Setup ➤ Groups.
	
2.	
On the Groups page (Figure 7-51), click on the Create New 
Group button.

and modify its share details (Figure 7-58).
Testing
You have been testing the REMS app here and there to see how it runs. However, a big 
part of the testing happens in the field with actual users.
It is in the testing phase that the hidden bugs and quirks surface, as the field experts 
(i.e. users) use and abuse the software, pushing it to its limits.
I don’t want to get into testing methodology here. Zoho Creator apps don’t need 
to be tested the way other software does. However, I encourage you to learn about beta 
testing, as well as functional and non-functional testing, at https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Software_testing#Functional_vs_non-functional_testing.
A well-tested application will cause you less headaches once it’s rolled out.

Rollout
Congratulations! The hard part is over. You have designed, implemented, and even 
rigorously tested the REMS app. It has turned out to be a decent app that’s usable for 
real scenarios and has the potential to grow.
Now is the time to do the harder part of the work, the rollout! This phase involves 
releasing the app fully or partially to users, so that they can start using it as a part of their 
day-to-day business.
Ongoing training sessions with the users should start before rollout and continue 
post rollout as well. Users must feel comfortable with all aspects of the software and 
genuinely believe that it will make their lives easier and improve their productivity.
Change management (https://www.prosci.com/change-management/what-is-change-
management) is another foundational aspect of the rollout phase and beyond. Managing 
change properly (https://www.strategy-business.com/article/rr00006?gko=643d0) can 
help your new system succeed and grow. Ignoring it could bring about failure in adoption 
and will impact the initial intention of creating a new system in the first place.
It is human nature to resist and often fear change. If you are replacing the chaotic 
but convenient and familiar spreadsheet-based real estate management of the past with 
modern feature-rich and cloud-based REMS, don’t expect your users to cheerfully jump 
on the new software wagon.
There are going to be early adopters, skeptics, complainers, and also haters. You have 
to manage expectations and coach users through the transition. Be patient with them 
and let them make mistakes. Be sure they know that you (the developer, or the decision 
maker) are there for them.
Summary
This is arguably the most important chapter in the book. It summed up the knowledge 
from the previous chapters and took you through all the steps of creating functional and 
successful business software.
You have (I hope) learned more than just dragging and dropping components and 
building an app. This chapter, although lightly, touched on some of the best practices of 
building good information solutions and succeeding in implementing and rolling them 
out.
There are endless resources to learn about concepts, methodologies, and best 
practices mentioned in this chapter. The key is to learn as much as you need and practice 
as much as possible.
The REMS is in a good shape to be developed more and become a real app you 
can use in a small- to medium-sized real estate operation. I will leave that to your 
imagination, skills, and requirements.
In the next chapter, you look at how to connect Creator apps to the outside world 
and extend their capabilities even further.

CHAPTER 8
Connecting Your Apps  
to the World
You have come a long way since you started reading this book. You learned how to create 
business applications that solve real-life problems, without spending an arm and a leg 
developing them.
But there is still much more you can with Zoho Creator. You can extend Creator’s 
capabilities by connecting it to other apps and services. In the cloud, integration and 
interoperability with other apps and services are essential for any decent platform. 
Creator offers both.
There is a host of all the apps and services that Zoho Creator can integrate with. 
You should familiarize yourself with these, so you can utilize them as needed, instead of 
replicating their features in Creator.
For example, if you want to add invoicing features to your app, you will be happy to 
know that Zoho Creator and Zoho Invoice can connect and take care of your invoicing 
requirements for you. Incorporating external tools could dramatically reduce the 
resources needed to implement information systems for your organization.
■
■Reference  This chapter looks at some of integrations available to Zoho Creator. You 
can read about all of them on the Zoho web site and delve deeper in each one as per your 
business requirements: https://www.zoho.com/creator/integration.html.
Connecting to Zoho Apps
One of the USPs (unique selling propositions) of the Zoho Suite is that you have a choice 
of more than 30 business apps to work with a single Zoho account (i.e., single sign-on). 
Of course, you may need to pay for each app separately. However, the convenience of 
single sign-on and the smoother learning curve due to the familiar look and feel makes a 
strong case for Zoho apps.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
194
Another key factor in choosing Zoho apps over the competition is that almost all of 
them integrate out-of-the-box. Some integrations are as easy as drag and drop and others 
need a bit of work on the API (application programming interface) side.
Creator integrates with these Zoho apps:
• 
Zoho CRM—From Creator, you can manage CRM records (find, 
add, edit, delete, and attach files) as well as show CRM data in a 
Creator app. This allows you to create Creator apps that extend the 
features of the CRM or apps that consume data stored in the CRM.
• 
Zoho Invoice—From Creator, you can manage invoices (find, 
add, and edit) and rely on its advanced invoicing capabilities in 
Creator apps.
• 
Zoho Books—Creator can manage records in Books (find, add, 
and edit) and provide advanced accounting in one package.
• 
Zoho Calendar—From Creator, you can create calendar events 
from and automate event booking for your business.
• 
Zoho Reports—From Creator, you can manage records (add, 
edit, and delete) in tables in Reports. By manipulating the Reports 
data, your app can have access to complex reporting and data 
analysis features.
• 
Zoho Recruit—From Creator, you can manage records in Recruit 
(find, add, edit, and upload files) and extend the capabilities of 
HR related apps.
• 
Zoho Desk—Creator can manage records in Desk (find, add, and 
edit) and add user support to the apps.
• 
Subscriptions—You can manage records in Subscriptions (find, 
add, and edit) and add subscription features to your apps.
■
■Reference  You can learn about Zoho’s integration with these apps in the official 
documentation at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script/integration-with-
other-zoho-products.html.
Connecting to G Suite
Zoho Creator for G Suite (https://gsuite.google.com/together/) (formerly known 
as Google Apps) enables G Suite users to have easy access to Zoho Creator applications. 
If your organization is using G Suite, you can install the Zoho Creator service on your 
organization's G Suite account and extend G Suite with the power of Zoho Creator.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
195
■
■Note   Before connecting Creator and G Suite, make sure you are fully aware of the 
ramifications of sharing vital information between the two platforms. You will need to check 
with the administrators of both G Suite and Creator to determine what information can be 
shared and what level of access G Suite users can have to the information stored in Creator 
apps (and vice versa).
Using G Suite integration, you can perform a number of tasks:
• 
Convert Google Sheets spreadsheets to Zoho Creator apps in a 
couple of easy steps (https://www.zoho.com/creator/google-
sheet-to-app.html?src=gsuite), which among other benefits, 
will help you:
• 
Transition from managing large and error-prone 
spreadsheets to nicely designed database apps.
• 
Add business logic and workflow automation.
• 
Control data access and manage the safety of information in 
a much more controlled way.
• 
Import G Suite users to Creator and allow them to connect with 
their G Suite credentials. This helps G Suite admins maintain 
control in a more managed and central manner, while extending 
the capabilities of G Suite with Creator.
• 
Share apps fully or partially with Google Groups and manage data 
access levels more efficiently.
• 
Access Google Calendar and create events directly from Creator.
• 
Access Google Drive and upload documents to Google Docs from 
Creator.
■

documentation at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/gapps/zoho-creator-for-
google-apps.html.
Other Integrations
Integration with Zoho Apps and G Suite gives you an edge. To make Creator even more 
powerful, you can integrate it with eternal services, such as SMS providers, accounting 
software, payment gateways, third-party CRMs, and others.
Some of these integrations are available from within Creator, and this chapter 
touches on those in a bit. Some need more work from your side.

SMS
You might wonder how SMS (Short Message Service)  is still a thing in the age of social 
messaging (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.); however, 25 years later (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#History), SMS is still alive and kicking especially in 
marketing and sales.
If you are not convinced yet, read about some of the use cases of text messages on 
Twilio’s web site (https://www.twilio.com/use-cases).
Zoho Creator offers a useful SMS gateway to send SMS from within apps to automate 
dynamic messaging to prospects, clients, and users alike. As of this writing, Creator supports 
five major SMS providers: Twilio, Clickatell, Screen Magic, ClockWorkSMS, and Hoiio.
The usage is fairly simple. All you need to do is call the sms.send() method for the specific 
provider in your code. For example, to send a SMS using Twilio, you can simply write:
SMS_Response = twilio.sms.send("<sms notification name>","<to>","<message>");
• 
If the SMS is sent successfully, the value of the SMS_Response 
variable is set to {"status":"success"}. Otherwise, it will be 
{"message":"<Reason for failure>","status":"failure"}.
• 
<to> is the mobile number of the recipient.
• 
<message> is the text message to be sent to the recipient.
• 
<sms notification name> differs for each provider.
To set up <sms notification name> for Twilio, follow these steps:
	
1.	
While you’re logged in, open the Zoho Creator home page.
	
2.	
Click the Setup icon (it’s shaped like a gear) on the top bar.

On the Account Setup page  (Figure 8-1), under Extensions, 
click Connections.
	
4.	
On the Connections page, click Add Connection. Then under 
SMS, click on Twilio (Figure 8-2).

(Figure 8-3).
■
■Note  If you don’t have a Twilio account, head to https://www.twilio.com/ and create 
one. Then follow the steps to set up a trial Twilio number. Auth Token and Account SID are 
both available on the Twilio Dashboard, which is accessible from https://www.twilio.

QuickBooks
When it comes to SME accounting software, Intuit® QuickBooks is a household name.  
It is smart that Zoho Creator connects to QuickBooks, as many companies already use it 
for all their accounting needs.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
199
Creator connects directly to any QuickBooks account (from the Connections page, 
as you saw in the previous section) and allows you to access supported modules and 
perform the following tasks in QuickBooks in your Creator apps:
• 
Create new records in QuickBooks in any module listed here
• 
Get a number of records from QuickBooks into Creator based on 
specific criteria
• 
Get a single record from QuickBooks based on a record ID
• 
Search in QuickBooks with a SQL (Structured Query Language) 
query string
• 
Update records in QuickBooks using their record IDs
These QuickBooks modules are supported in Creator:
• 
Customer
• 
Vendor
• 
Item
• 
Invoice
• 
Account
• 
Employee
• 
Department
■

PayPal
We live in the age of ecommerce. Amazon just swallowed Whole Foods, Etsy is booming, 
and everyone is selling something online.
Since the early days of ecommerce, PayPal (and a number of others) became the de 
facto payment gateway when working with bureaucratic and clunky online gateways offered 
by the big banks weren’t worth the effort. Today, PayPal is more relevant than ever and if 
they start accepting Cryptocurrencies, it is safe to say that will stay to see the next century.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
200
The good news for us humble users and developers of Zoho Creator is that it 
integrates well with PayPal and allows Creator apps to accept recurring and non-
recurring payments via PayPal.
All you need is a PayPal business account (https://www.paypal.com/buinsess) and 
some configuration in Creator.
■
■Reference  Learn more about accepting payments via PayPal from the official 
documentation at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/forms/accept-payments-

Salesforce
Salesforce is the poster child of modern CRMs. It is a behemoth of a platform with endless 
features and great flexibility to be customized and programmed. It is impressive how it 
actually ignited a movement and contributed greatly to the success of SaaS (Software as a 
Service).
Zoho offers its own CRM, which is a powerful, robust, and flexible solution delivering 
on its promise. As mentioned previously in this chapter, Zoho CRM integrates perfectly 
with Creator; however, Creator keeps an open mind and works with Salesforce too.
Creator integration with Salesforce allows you to do the following in any of the 
supported modules:
• 
Create new records in Salesforce
• 
Get a number of records based on specific criteria from Salesforce 
into Creator
• 
Get single records by record ID
• 
Search for records in Salesforce by sending a SQL query
These are the Salesforce modules supported in Zoho Creator:
• 
Lead
• 
Contact
• 
Account
• 
Case
• 
Solution
• 
Product
• 
Campaign

REST API
So far this chapter has covered how Zoho Creator can access and consume data from other 
apps and platforms, but Creator also generously allows external apps to access its data as well.
Zoho Creator offers a set of REST (Representational State Transfer) and RPC (Remote 
Procedure Calls) APIs to share data with the outside world.
You can use these APIs and write code in any of your favorite programming 
languages to connect to Creator.
This section focuses on REST API simply because Creator offers more flexibility with 
REST. I also find REST to be more common when it comes to connecting to other apps 
and services.
■
■Reference  Learn more about REST from  
http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html.
Also, if you like to join the debate of REST vs. RPC, you are more than welcome to indulge 
yourself in a Google search: https://www.google.ae/search?q=rpc+vs+rest.
Using Creator REST API
To use the Zoho Creator API, you need an authentication token (auth token) unique to 
your Creator account. This key is for security measures and allows Creator to recognize 
third-party apps as friendly.
There are two ways to generate an auth token in Creator:
• 
Using the API mode, where you call the link in your app 
and receive the auth token in response: https://accounts.
zoho.com/apiauthtoken/nb/create?SCOPE=ZohoCreator/
creatorapi&EMAIL_ID=Zoho CREATOR Username or Email 
ID&PASSWORD=Zoho CREATOR Password.
• 
Using Browser mode by opening this link in your browser 
while logged in to Creator: https://accounts.zoho.com/
apiauthtoken/create?SCOPE.
The auth token is a 32-letter code (e.g., 01db6dfc41cd6edef8496b8b53f14254).  
You use it in your external programs to connect to Creator.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
202
REST API Capabilities
A REST call in Creator is basically a URL formatted in a certain way so that it gets called 
from an external program via GET or POST.
For example, to add a new record to a Creator app, you would use:
https://creator.zoho.com/api/<ownername>/<format>/<applicationName>/
form/<formName>/record/add
• 
<ownername> is the app owner name, i.e. admin username
• 
<format> is JSON or XML and will determine in which format the 
response will be generated
• 
<applicationName> and <formName> are self-explanatory
If you are sending this request using a GET method, you must include the auth token 
in the URL too:
https://creator.zoho.com/api/<ownername>/<format>/<applicationName>/
form/<formName>/record/add?authtoken=<AuthToken>
For a POSTrequest, for example from an HTML form, you can add a hidden  
authtoken field and pass along the auth token as a value.
Using the Creator API, you can perform the following:
• 
Add new records to Creator forms
• 
Edit existing records to Creator forms
• 
Delete existing records
• 
View records in Creator reports
• 
Get a list of
• 
Form fields in a given form
• 
Applications in an account
• 
Forms and reports in an application
■
■Reference  To learn more API methods in Creator, refer to the official documentation at: 
https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/api/.
What’s Next?
I am sure that you already have a few cool app ideas that you want to implement in 
Creator or you have already started with one or two.
As you go forward and become better at Creator, you can call yourself a Zoho Creator 
developer and get that well-deserved promotion or attract more customers and charge 
them for your hard-earned skills.

Chapter 8 ■ Connecting Your Apps to the World 
203
At this stage, you may want to join the budding Zoho Creator Developer community 
and take your work to the next level.
Simply log on to the Developers’ page and check out what is available to developers: 
https://www.zoho.com/creator/developers/.
If you haven’t yet, sign up for the Develop Edition of Zoho Creator at: https://www.
zoho.com/creator/developers/signup.html. The Developer Edition is a special edition 
that allows Creator developers to use the full version only for app development and 
testing at no cost.
Moreover, to show the world your expertise, you can apply for the Zoho Creator 
Certification Program and become a Zoho Creator Certified Developer or a Zoho 
Creator Certified Solution Provider at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/developers/
certification.html
You can also check out the App Gallery to download or buy the useful apps that other 
members of the community have built (see https://www.zoho.com/creator/apps/). It is 
a good idea to check out the App Gallery before you start developing a new app.
Last, but not least, the Marketplace is where you can look for apps, ask others to 
build you a custom app, and sell your own apps to others (see https://marketplace.
zoho.com/creator).
Summary
In this chapter, you got a bird’s eye view of Zoho Creator integrations with the outside 
world, within the Zoho ecosystem, and beyond.
It touched on some of the most important integrations and left the rest for you to 
discover.
This book has provided you with all the necessary knowledge to get up and running 
with Zoho Creator and start building useful business applications for yourself, your 
organization, and your clients.
However, there is still much to learn. I strongly recommend you study the underlying 
concepts, such as user experience design and usability as well as process mapping and 
flowcharting. The more you learn about the foundations of building good software and 
understanding users and business requirements, the better your apps will be for the 
world to use and appreciate.
Do not stop at mastering Deluge. Pick up a book or take some online courses about 
JavaScript or Python. Learn more about HTML and CSS and expand the breadth and 
depth of your knowledge about cloud-based programming. This will help you make better 
Creator apps that you can extend through APIs and that are not bound to Creator’s limits.
Zoho is actively developing Creator as a viable app development platform. Make 
sure you keep an eye on the news at: https://www.zoho.com/creator/whatsnew/ and 
https://www.zoho.com/creator/blog.
Rely on the official documentation and, when in doubt, look into the forums at: 
https://forums.zoho.com/zoho-creator.
Welcome to the joyful and rewarding world of building software. Congratulations for 
taking on this journey.
Good luck.
