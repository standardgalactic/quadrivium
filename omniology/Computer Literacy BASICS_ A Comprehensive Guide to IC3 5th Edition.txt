Computer Literacy BASICS, Fifth Edition, provides complete coverage on computing basics, including computer hardware and 
components, operating system software, application software, networks, and the Internet. Lessons are organized in three modules, 
and within each module, concepts and features are introduced in a logical progression to build on previously learned concepts 
and features. Illustrations provide visual reinforcement of features and concepts, and sidebars provide notes, tips, and concepts 
related to the lesson topics. Step-by-Step exercises provide guidance for using the features. End-of-lesson projects include a 
comprehensive review of the lesson content. Teamwork projects, Critical Thinking activities, Online Discovery challenges, Job 
Skills projects, and Explore and Solve tasks provide additional practice and require you to apply your problem-solving skills.
The Computing Fundamentals module focuses on hardware and software and how they work together. The lesson activities 
include exercises that guide students to explore the Windows operating system, change settings, and customize the desktop. 
Students also learn how to manage files and folders, install and uninstall software, and solve computer problems. Hands-on 
exercises, lesson reviews, and end-of-lesson projects provide students with opportunities to practice and master computing 
fundamental skills. The Module 1 IC3 Pretest includes additional review questions and projects.
The Key Applications module focuses on four of the Microsoft Office 2013 applications: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
Access. The lessons explain the purpose of commonly used software features, and step-by-step exercises demonstrate how to 
use those features. The end-of-lesson projects provide additional practice to master using those features to complete typical 
day-to-day tasks at home, school, and work. The Module 2 IC3 Pretest includes review questions, projects, and an integrated 
project which entails using word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and databases to process information and then share 
the information with others.
The Living Online module introduces students to communication network fundamentals and the relationships between net-
works and the Internet. Through hands-on exercises, students learn how to use e-mail software to exchange e-mail messages. 
They also learn how to use a Web browser to navigate the Internet, visit Web sites, and find information. The final section 
focuses on how to use computers at work, school, and home. It discusses the risks of working with hardware and software and 
the standards for using the Internet safely, ethically, and legally. The Module 3 IC3 Pretest provides a thorough recap of living 
online concepts and skills, including review questions, projects, and a job simulation.
To complete all lessons, end-of-lesson material, and IC3 Pretests in this book will require approximately 55 hours.

Mod2-148 
Module 2 Key Applications
Suppose you have a document in Word that includes information you want to 
arrange in several lines across two or three columns. You create the columns you 
need in Word by setting tab stops. However, there is an easier and faster way. The 
table features in Word make the task of arranging text and numbers in columns both 
quick and easy. Borders and shading also help to organize information in a mean-
ingful way.
Creating a Table
A table consists of cells that you add content to, such as text, numbers, or graphics. 
A cell represents one intersection of a row and a column in a table. In a table, rows 
go across and columns go down. It is common to add headings at the top of columns 
to label the content in the columns. The first row in a table or data source with the 
column headings is referred to as the header row.
To create a table, you must first decide how many columns and rows you want 
in the table. You then create a table grid and enter the data in the cells. To move the 
insertion point from one cell to another, you can press the Tab key or the arrow keys. 
When you reach the end of a row and press Tab, the insertion point moves to the first 
cell in the next row.
Step-by-Step 15.1
 1. Open Word and create a new blank document. Save the document as 
Calories 1, followed by your initials. If necessary, turn off the display of 
nonprinting characters.
 2. Click the INSeRT tab. In the Tables group shown in Figure 15–1, click 
the Table button 
. A grid of table cells is displayed.

Quick Tip
You can also create a table by 
clicking the Table button and 
then clicking Insert Table to open 
the dialog box. Then in the Insert 
Table dialog box, enter the num-
ber of rows and columns.
 3. Drag the mouse pointer down the grid until seven rows of cells are 
highlighted, then continue to drag the mouse pointer across the grid 
to select three columns. The top of the grid displays 3×7 Table and the 
table’s Live Preview is displayed in the document window, as shown in 
Figure 15–2, as three columns by seven rows.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
This lesson introduces you to computers and their role in daily life, and defines what 
it means to be computer literate. The lesson also focuses on the part of a computer 
that most affects your computing experiences: the operating system (OS). In addition 
to learning about what an operating system does, you’ll identify types of operating 
systems and explore the most recent version of Microsoft Windows.
Understanding the Importance of Computers
Computers are everywhere. During a typical day, you might use your phone to send a 
message to a friend about meeting for lunch and listen to music as you walk to class. 
Although you might not realize it, you also use a computer when you withdraw cash 
from an automated teller machine (ATM), change the temperature setting on a home 
thermostat, and turn on cruise control as you’re driving a car. See Figure 1–1.

Depending on your job, you probably use computers at work to take a diner’s 
order at a restaurant, process a sale, or control a robot on a factory floor.
Overall, computers assist you in most parts of your daily life. They play a cen-
tral role in worldwide communications, entertainment, education, commerce, and 
other business activities. In fact, computers have been around since the late 1940s, 
when they were massive, special-purpose machines with names such as UNIVAC 
and ENIAC and were designed for use by the military and government. These early 
computers took hours to complete a calculation, occupied small buildings or entire 
city blocks, and cost millions of dollars. Today’s smartphones have more process-
ing power than a UNIVAC, cost less than any of its components, and fit in the palm 
of your hand. The future promises innovations such as wearable computers, using 
human thought as input, and computer-controlled micro-robots that treat and pos-
sibly cure cancer. See Figure 1–2.

But what exactly is a computer? What does it really do? Understanding what a 
computer is and how it works can help you to appreciate and use computers more 
effectively.
A computer is an electronic device that receives data (input), processes data, 
stores data, and produces a result (output). Data is a collection of raw, unprocessed 
facts, including text, numbers, sound, images, and video.
A computer includes hardware and software. The actual machine—wires, tran-
sistors, and circuits—is called hardware. Software consists of instructions, or pro-
grams, for controlling the computer so it performs tasks. To perform tasks, a computer 
receives data through an input device such as a keyboard, processes the data, produces 
information on an output device such as a monitor, and stores the information on 
a storage device. The input and output devices connected to the computer such as 
keyboards and monitors are also types of hardware called peripherals. When data is 
processed into a meaningful form, it becomes information. See Figure 1–3.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
If you work as a clerk in a store, you might use a computer to complete a sale 
for a customer as follows:
n 
Input data: As you scan an item with a barcode reader, the computer records the 
name and code of the item.
n 
Process data: The computer uses software instructions to process the data—the 
item name and code—by looking up the price.
n 
Output information: The computer displays the information—the name and 
price of the item—on a screen, and then prints it on a receipt.
n 
Store data and information: The computer temporarily stores the item name and 
code as it looks up the price, and then permanently stores information about the 
sale on a hard disk, which is hardware for storing data.
This series of steps—input, processing, output, and storage (IPOS)—is often 
referred to as the information processing cycle. You, the computer user, perform the 
input step first, and then the computer takes over to process the data. The computer 
often stores the data temporarily, displays the output, and then stores the information 
during the same stage in the cycle. See Figure 1–4.
Above and Beyond
When computer experts say 
“garbage in, garbage out,” they 
mean that the data you provide 
as input must be accurate and 
reasonable; otherwise, the output 
will be inaccurate or misleading.

Computer Literacy
Innovations in computer technology have been rapid since the computer was intro-
duced. To keep up with the pace of change, you need to be computer literate, which 
means that you can use today’s computer hardware and software efficiently to enhance 
your life and the lives of those around you. Besides having polished computer skills, 
being computer literate also means that you understand a wide range of information 
about current computer technology and how it’s used to solve problems. Not everyone 
has the opportunity to be computer literate, however. A digital divide is an economic 
gap between those who are computer literate and enjoy access to computer technology 
and those who do not. The term can refer to people divided from technology by geog-
raphy, age, education, or socioeconomic status. Attaining computer literacy is impor-
tant because it can help you succeed in a career, keep in touch with people around the 
world, and participate as an active, contributing member of contemporary society.

Mod1-7
Types of Software
If you shop for a computer at a retail store, the salesperson emphasizes hardware 
details, such as how quickly the data is processed into information (referred to as pro-
cessing speed) and how much information can be stored (storage capacity.) However, 
hardware is not what makes a computer useful—the software installed on it does. 
Without software, a computer is only a collection of electronic components in a case.
Software provides the means for you to interact with the computer’s hardware 
by entering and receiving information through the user interface. The software on 
most personal computers has a graphical user interface (GUI), which displays pic-
tures called icons and other visual elements that allow you to interact with data and 
execute commands. For example, to print a document created and stored on a com-
puter, you might select an icon of a printer on the computer screen. The software 
on the computer sends the information necessary to print the document to a printer 
attached to the computer. Figure 1–5 identifies some objects in the Windows 8 
graphical user interface.

Some software uses a command-line interface, which requires you to type text 
commands to interact with the computer. Figure 1–6 shows an example of DOS 
(short for Disk Operating System), which has a command-line interface.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Although command-line interfaces require you to remember and type complex 
commands and allow little room for error, many advanced computer users prefer 
them because they offer precise control over system details.
In contrast to command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces are visually invit-
ing and easy for novices to use with only basic training. However, they rarely let users 
directly access detailed technical settings the way that command-line interfaces do.
System Software and Application Software
A computer relies on two main types of software, application software and system 
software. System software is the software that runs a computer, and includes the 
operating system and utility programs. An operating system is software that coordi-
nates the resources and activities on a computer. A utility program helps the operat-
ing system set up, maintain, and protect a computer. For example, you use a utility 
program when you connect your computer to the Internet, a worldwide system of 
linked computers. 
As you use a computer, system software works in the background to man-
age hardware and run other software, called application software, which is the 
software you use most directly to complete a specific task or to create something 
electronically. Using application software, you can perform tasks such as writing a 
report, creating a video, viewing a Web page, or sending photos to a friend. In gen-
eral, a computer runs system software to perform computer tasks, while you run 
application software to carry out your work or personal tasks. Table 1–1 compares 
operating systems and application software.
Above and Beyond
A computer’s operating system is 
sometimes called the ­platform. 
Application software is developed 
to run on a particular platform. 
When you purchase an applica-
tion, the manufacturer notes 
which platform it runs on. Some 
manufacturers provide one ver-
sion of an application designed 
for one platform, and another 
version designed for a differ-
ent platform. Make sure you 
purchase software that runs on 
the operating system you have 
installed on your computer.

Lesson 1  Computers and Operating Systems	
Mod1-9
Types of Operating Systems
Operating systems fall into four major categories that depend on the type of device 
for which they are designed: personal computers, mobile computing devices, serv-
ers, and devices other than computers. When you purchase a personal computer or 
mobile device, the operating system is already installed, so your preference for an 
operating system often determines the computers you can consider purchasing.
Personal Computer Operating Systems
Operating systems installed on a single computer are called personal or desktop 
operating systems. These are considered single-user operating systems because one 
user interacts with the operating system at a time. They are also multitasking operat-
ing systems because they let you work with more than one program at the same time. 
For example, you can look up definitions on the Internet as you write a report and 
receive e-mail on your laptop.
The three most popular personal computer operating systems are Windows, 
Mac OS, and Linux. Currently, Microsoft Windows runs on more personal computers 
worldwide than any other operating system. For many years, the most widely used 
version of Windows was Windows XP, released in 2001. Windows 7, released in 
2009, recently surpassed Windows XP in popularity. Windows 8, the most recent 
major version of Windows, was released in 2012. 
Windows became widespread because it ran on inexpensive personal computers 
created by a variety of computer manufacturers. It retained its popularity because it 
is easy to use and personalize and runs more types of applications than other operat-
ing systems.
In contrast, Mac OS runs only on Apple Macintosh computers. The current 
version of the operating system is called Mac OS X, where the X is the Roman 
numeral 10. Releases of Mac OS X up to 10.8 are named after big cats, such 
as Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion. Figure 1–7 shows a Macintosh computer 
running Mac OS X Mountain Lion. Mac OS X version 10.9 is called Mavericks, 
which marks the beginning of a change in the naming scheme from big cats to 
places in California. (Mavericks is a surfing location in northern California.)

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Mac OS set the standard for GUI operating systems. Mac OS X has developed 
the reputation from its users of being a very secure, reliable, and easy-to-maintain 
operating system.
Linux is a personal computer operating system related to UNIX, an operating 
system first developed in the 1960s for large, special-purpose computers that are fre-
quently used by scientists and programmers. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which 
are proprietary operating systems, meaning they are owned and updated solely by 
their companies, Linux is released to the public as open-source software, which 
means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute it. Programmers around the world 
have collaborated on improving Linux and developing utilities, applications, and 
enhancements.
Linux is available in versions called distributions, including commercial dis-
tributions such as Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Mandriva. Distributions offered 
by noncommercial Linux communities include Debian, Slackware, and Gentoo. 
Figure  1–8 shows Ubuntu (named after the African philosophy that encourages 
humanity toward others), which includes features similar to Windows and Mac OS.
Above and Beyond
Apple Computers is often 
credited with introducing the 
graphical user interface when 
it released its first Macintosh 
­computer. However, Xerox 
Corporation first developed 
the idea of using icons in an 
interface for an ­experimental 
computer called the Alto. 
This computer and its icons, 
­desktop metaphor, and menus 
of ­commands that popped up 
next to objects influenced the 
design of later graphical user 
­interfaces, including the one for 
the Macintosh.

Early Days of Personal Operating Systems
Personal computer operating systems appeared in the 1980s when IBM and other companies developed 
the first personal computers. All of these computers had a command-line interface; many ran a version 
of DOS, such as MS-DOS. (“MS” stands for Microsoft.) In 1984, Apple introduced the Mac OS, which 
featured one of the first graphical user interfaces on a commercially available computer. Microsoft released 
Windows 1.0 shortly after the Macintosh debuted, though Windows did not become popular until Microsoft 
released version 3.1 in 1992. Linux was developed and introduced in the early 1990s by a Finnish student 
named Linus Torvalds, who set out to create a free operating system kernel. Torvalds released Linux under 
the terms of a General Public License (GPL), which allows you to copy the operating system for your own 
use, to give to others, or to sell.
TECHNOLOGY TIMELINE
Some distributions of Linux such as BSD have command-line interfaces. All 
distributions offer the advantages of running on any type of hardware, providing 
excellent security, and being free to install and use.

Mobile Operating Systems
A mobile operating system is designed for a small handheld computing device such 
as a smartphone or tablet. A mobile operating system includes features similar to a 
personal operating system, but is simpler and significantly smaller. A smartphone is 
a cell phone that includes many features of a computer, allowing it to run general-
purpose computing applications. Larger than smartphones, tablets are one-piece 
mobile computers that typically include a touchscreen, which is a screen you touch 
to interact with the GUI. Mobile operating systems are designed to fit into the lim-
ited memory of mobile devices and work well with mobile hardware and features 
such as touchscreens, navigation systems, and speech recognition.
Four popular mobile operating systems include iOS, Android, Windows Phone, 
and Windows RT, which are designed for smartphones and tablets, as shown in 
Figure 1–9.

As shown in Figure 1–9, iOS is a version of Mac OS X written for Apple’s mobile 
devices, including iPhones and iPads. Google developed Android as an open-source 
operating system designed to run on many types of smartphones and tablets. Android 
is derived from Linux. Windows Phone and Windows RT are similar to Windows 8.
Mobile operating systems primarily work as single-user, single-tasking operat-
ing systems because they let only one user perform a single task at one time. A few 
recent versions of mobile operating systems let you perform some tasks at the same 
time, such as search the Internet while making a phone call. They can be considered 
single-user, multitasking operating systems, though they allow you to perform only 
two tasks at the same time.

Embedded Operating Systems
Similar to mobile operating systems are embedded operating systems, which 
run devices such as ATMs, navigation systems, portable media players, digital 
video recorders, and other consumer electronics. An embedded operating system 
is included in the hardware of a standalone device. Unlike mobile operating sys-
tems, however, embedded operating systems are designed to meet a specific pur-
pose and perform a single type of task, such as providing maps and directions. In 
addition, an embedded operating system runs with little or no intervention from 
you or other users. You provide a specific type of input, such as a destination, 
and the embedded operating system supplies the output, such as directions. See 
Figure 1–10.
Figure 1–10  Portable and built-in navigation devices have embedded 
operating systems
Above and Beyond
Many embedded operating 
systems are specialized ver-
sions of their more fully featured 
counterparts, such as Linux and 
Windows. For example, comput-
erized cash registers, or point-of-
sale devices, use an embedded 
version of Windows to manage 
sales transactions and keep them 
secure. Household electron-
ics such as microwave ovens 
and digital video recorders use 
embedded versions of Linux to 
perform their tasks. The iPod has 
an embedded version of iOS that 
lets you select and play songs.
◗  Vocabulary
embedded operating system
Like most mobile operating systems, embedded operating systems are for 
single users performing a single task at one time. Mobile operating systems such 
as Android began as embedded operating systems for cell phones and were dedi-
cated to performing tasks such as storing, retrieving, and calling phone numbers. 
As cell phones evolved into more fully featured smartphones, with the ability to 
take photos, capture videos, play music, connect to the Internet, and organize 
­personal information, the embedded operating systems evolved into mobile oper-
ating systems.
Server Operating Systems
A server operating system resides on a server and is used to manage a network, 
which is a group of two or more computers linked together. A server is a com-
puter that provides network services such as e-mail to other computers, or clients. 
Because of their purpose, server operating systems are sometimes called network 
operating systems. Figure 1–11 shows a number of client computers connected to 
a single server.

Lesson 1  Computers and Operating Systems	
Mod1-13
Each client computer on a network has its own personal operating system, 
while the server runs a server operating system to manage the requests for services 
from the client computers. For example, if a user on the network wants to print a 
document, the server operating system handles the request and sends the print job 
to the printer, where it lines up with other print jobs in a certain order. That way, 
the printer isn’t overloaded with print jobs from dozens of other users on the net-
work. An expert called the network administrator uses the server operating system 
to manage the network and its users.
Server operating systems are multiuser operating systems because they let 
many users run programs and take advantage of the server’s resources at the same 
time. One important task a server operating system performs is balancing user needs 
so that everyone can access the services and resources they request and that a prob-
lem with one user doesn't affect all users.
Windows Server is the server version of Windows, and Mac OS X Server is 
the server version of Mac OS. Versions and distributions of UNIX and Linux are 
also server operating systems. In fact, many servers that handle e-mail and Internet 
access use UNIX because it is a powerful, flexible multiuser operating system. 
Operating System Tasks
The operating system controls your computer from soon after you turn on the power 
until you turn it off. During that time, the operating system takes care of technical 
tasks so that you can focus on completing a school project, listening to music, or 
communicating with other people, for example. The technical tasks an operating sys-
tem performs include completing start-up steps, managing memory, processing input 
and output, controlling hardware, and ending a computer session.

Completing Start-Up Steps
You turn on the power to the computer to start an operating system. The boot process 
is a series of steps the operating system must complete before you can interact with 
the operating system. Figure 1–12 illustrates the boot process.

Figure 1–12  Boot process
As Figure 1–12 shows, the boot process includes the following steps:
	 1.	 The computer receives and distributes electrical power to its circuits so the 
system components can run.
	 2.	 When a system component called the ROM chip receives power, it starts a util-
ity program called the BIOS, which stands for basic input/output system. The 
BIOS contains instructions for starting the system before the operating system 
is loaded.
	 3.	 The BIOS performs the power-on self-test (POST) to check critical system 
components and make sure they are running properly. During this step, your 
computer might beep and flash messages on the screen.
	 4.	 If the system components are running properly, the BIOS looks for devices 
connected to the computer and checks their settings. If the BIOS finds an error, 
the computer might beep again and display error messages describing the 
problem. 
	 5.	 If Steps 3–4 are successful and error-free, the BIOS searches for the system 
files the computer needs to run the operating system, and then loads them into 
random access memory (RAM), which is memory the computer uses to store 
instructions and data temporarily. Next, the BIOS loads the kernel, or core, of 
the operating system into RAM. The kernel takes over control of the computer 
from the BIOS.
	 6.	 The operating system completes setup tasks, such as requesting your username 
and password, starts and runs utility software and other programs in the back-
ground, and then displays the main user interface screen.

Above and Beyond
Starting or restarting a ­computer 
is also called booting the 
­computer because it must go 
through the boot process before 
you can use the ­operating 
system. The term “boot” 
comes from the ­expression 
“­pulling yourself up by your own 
­bootstraps,” which means to 
accomplish something ­without 
external help. A cold boot 
refers to starting a computer 
that is turned off. A warm boot 
(also called a soft boot) refers 
to restarting a computer that 
is already turned on. Of the 
steps shown in Figure 1–12, 
the ­computer performs only 
Steps 4–6 during a warm boot.

Lesson 1  Computers and Operating Systems	
Mod1-15
In Step-by-Step 1.1, you start a computer that runs Windows 8, the most recent 
version of the Windows operating system, to display the Start screen, which is where 
you start working on a Windows 8 computer. Many Windows 8 computers have touch-
screens, while others use a keyboard and a mouse or touchpad. The Step-by-Steps in 
this book assume you are using a computer with a keyboard and mouse, so the steps 
use mouse terms such as click (press the left mouse button) when instructing you to 
interact with the computer. For example, you click an icon to select it. If you are using 
a touchscreen, you should tap instead of click. The introductions to other Step-by-
Steps in Module 1 will explain other substitutions as you need them.
Before you start Step-by-Step 1.1, make sure your computer is turned off. When 
completing the steps, you might need to select your username (a unique name that 
identifies you to Windows 8) and enter a password (a confidential word or phrase), if a 
­password is set for your computer, before Windows displays the Start screen. Selecting a 
username and entering a password is called signing in (or logging on), which means to 
identify yourself to the operating system. If you don’t know your username or password, 
see your instructor for help.

Managing Memory
After starting up, one of the main tasks an operating system performs is managing 
computer resources. In a computer system, a resource is any component the system 
requires to do work. The main resources are memory, processing components, stor-
age space, and peripherals.
An operating system manages memory so that it uses RAM efficiently. RAM 
is a critical resource because computers have only a limited amount, and every 
­program—applications, utility programs, even the operating system itself—needs 
space in RAM to run. When you start an application, the operating system allo-
cates RAM to that application. When you close an application, the operating system 
reclaims the RAM to assign it to another program.
If you run more than one application at the same time, the computer can run 
out of RAM. In that case, the operating system might close an application or shut 
down the computer unexpectedly (this is called a crash). To prevent crashes and 
gain memory, operating systems take advantage of virtual memory, which is part of 
a computer’s hard disk that can work as additional RAM. For example, suppose you 
have five applications running and then start a sixth application. Windows might 
have enough RAM to display the user interface for the application, but not enough 
to allow you to complete any tasks in the application. To gain memory to start the 
sixth application, Windows moves data from one of the other running applications 
out of RAM and into virtual memory. This processing is called swapping and con-
tinues until you close one of the open applications. See Figure 1–14.

Lesson 1  Computers and Operating Systems	
Mod1-17
In general, as the operating system runs out of RAM for programs, it swaps 
pages of data from RAM to virtual memory. (A page is the amount of data and 
instructions the operating system can swap at one time.) The part of a computer’s 
storage space dedicated to virtual memory is also called the page file or swap file.
Although using virtual memory means the operating system can access more 
memory than is available in RAM, swapping is slower than using RAM alone. If 
you notice an application responding more slowly than usual to your commands, the 
operating system is probably using virtual memory.
Processing Input and Output
Another major task for the operating system is processing input and output. When 
you type text on the keyboard to provide input to a software application, the operat-
ing system accepts and processes the data so the computer can display the text as 
output on the monitor. 
Often, the operating system must handle many input and output tasks at the 
same time, such as when you click buttons and enter text to create a document, 
or when you have more than one application running at once. To keep your com-
puter running smoothly, the operating system sets a sequence for processing input 
and output tasks. For example, if you want to print a large document containing 
text and graphics, the printer must receive the entire document before it starts 
­printing. Instead of waiting for the printer and slowing down processing, the oper-
ating ­system places the document data into a buffer, part of memory or storage 
where data waits until it can be transferred to a device. In the meantime, you can 
continue working with the computer without interruption. When the printer has 
received the entire document, the operating system removes the data from the 
buffer. Sending print data to a buffer before printing it is called spooling. See 
Figure 1–15.

In Step-by-Step 1.2, you use two techniques to start and close Windows appli-
cations. First, you start the Weather application from the Start screen. When you do, 
the Weather application takes up the entire screen and provides a clean, uncluttered 
workspace for viewing weather information. Because of these two characteristics, 
the Weather application is considered a Windows 8 application, or app for short. 
You use a different technique to start Microsoft Word, which is an example of a 
desktop application, a program that opens and runs in a window on the desktop. 
The desktop is the main work area for running productivity applications, especially 
those created for earlier versions of Windows, such as Windows 7. A window is a 
rectangular work area that contains tools for performing work and interacting with 
the application.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Controlling Hardware
The operating system considers every hardware device connected to the computer as 
an input or output resource. For example, a microphone is an input resource and a 
speaker is an output resource, both for audio data such as music and spoken words. 
To control a hardware resource, the operating system communicates with a driver, 
also called a device driver, which is a small program that enables the operating sys-
tem to interact with the device. Each device must have a driver, which is typically 
provided by the device manufacturer. One of the operating system’s setup tasks is to 
activate the driver for each device connected to the computer so the device works as 
you expect it to work.
If you install new hardware, such as speakers that plug into your computer, 
the operating system usually recognizes the device immediately or the next time 
you start the computer. Because the operating system includes drivers for common 
devices, it searches for the correct driver on the computer and then installs it so you 
can use the new hardware right away. This feature is called Plug and Play. If the 
operating system can’t find the right driver on the computer, it typically displays 
instructions for acquiring and installing the driver software.
Ending a Computer Session
A personal operating system needs to know when you’re finished working with a 
computer so it can protect itself and other software and keep your information pri-
vate while you are away. Although you select an option to end a session, the oper-
ating system takes care of the tasks, which range from shutting down, to restarting, 
signing out (also called logging off), switching users, and locking the computer. 
The options for signing out and switching users apply only if a computer has more 
than one user. Shutting down is the only option that turns off the power to the 
­computer. To work with the computer again, you turn on the power and wait for the 
computer to complete the boot process. So that you can avoid this delay while the 
computer reboots, operating systems provide alternatives to shutting down such as 
sleep and hibernate. These are low-power states that the operating system ­triggers 
automatically and let you quickly resume work without rebooting. (Lesson 4 
­discusses these power-saving states in more detail.) Table 1–2 summarizes the 
ways to end a ­computer session.

As with the boot process during startup, an operating system follows a proce-
dure to completely shut down. It completes the following steps to make sure all users 
have saved their data, all applications and system software are stable, and the operat-
ing system itself has not developed a problem. 
	 1.	 Checks users—If the computer has more than one user, the operating sys-
tem checks whether any others are signed in to use the computer. If they are, 
they might be required to end their sessions before the operating system can 
shut down.
	 2.	 Closes applications—The operating system sends a shutdown signal to each 
running application. If you have not saved data in an application, the operating 
system gives you a chance to save it before it sends a shutdown signal to the 
next application. The operating system also clears application data from virtual 
memory and swaps it to RAM.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
A computer is an electronic device that receives data (input), 
processes data, stores data, and produces a result (output).
n 
A computer includes hardware—physical equipment such as 
wires and circuits—and software—instructions or programs 
for controlling the computer.
n 
To keep up with the changes in computer technology, you need 
to be computer literate, which means that you can use today’s 
computer hardware and software efficiently to enhance your 
life and the lives of those around you.
n 
You interact with software through its user interface, which 
allows you to enter and receive information. Most contempo-
rary software has a graphical user interface (GUI), which uses 
icons and other graphics to accept data and commands. Other 
software uses a command-line interface, which requires you to 
type text commands to interact with the computer.
n 
A computer runs two main types of software: system software 
and application software. System software is the software that 
runs a computer, and includes the operating system and utility 
programs. A utility program helps the operating system set up, 
maintain, and protect a computer.
n 
An operating system is software that coordinates the resources 
and activities on a computer.
n 
Application software is software you use to carry out your 
work or personal tasks. 
n 
Personal computer operating systems run on personal com-
puters. Mobile operating systems are designed for handheld 
computers such as tablets and smartphones. Embedded oper-
ating systems are part of an electronic device or system other 
than a computer. Server operating systems run servers, the 
computers that coordinate networks.
n 
Single-user, single-tasking operating systems let only one user 
perform a single task at one time. Most mobile and embed-
ded operating systems fall into this category. Single-user mul-
titasking operating systems let one user run many programs 
at the same time, and include all personal computer operating 
systems. Multiuser operating systems such as server operating 
systems let many users run programs and take advantage of the 
computer’s resources at the same time.
n 
The technical tasks an operating system performs include 
completing start-up steps, managing memory, ­processing 
input and output, controlling hardware, and ending a 
­computer session. 
n 
The boot process is a series of steps the computer and oper-
ating system must complete before you can interact with the 
operating system.
n 
The resources an operating system manages include memory 
(RAM), processing components, storage space, and peripheral 
devices.
n 
To supplement RAM, operating systems take advantage of vir-
tual memory, which is part of a computer’s storage space that 
can work as additional memory.
n 
To keep your computer running smoothly, the operating sys-
tem sets a sequence for processing input and output tasks and 
uses buffers, which are parts of memory or storage where data 
waits until it can be transferred to a device.
n 
To control a hardware resource, the operating system commu-
nicates with a device driver, a small program that tells the oper-
ating system how to interact with the device.
n 
A personal operating system needs to know when you’re fin-
ished working with a computer so it can protect itself and other 
software and keep your information private while you are 
away. Although you select an option to end a session, the oper-
ating system takes care of the tasks, which range from shut-
ting down, to restarting, signing out (also called logging off), 
switching users, and locking the computer.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
As you use a computer, you are probably aware of how quickly it responds to your 
commands and performs other software tasks. How efficiently a computer performs 
is determined by its internal hardware components. This lesson explores the interac-
tions between hardware and software to process data and perform other basic tasks. 
You’ll start by identifying the major hardware components that affect performance, 
and learn how a component’s characteristics determine the software you can use 
on your system. You’ll also examine how to keep your operating system up to date, 
ensuring your computer and its devices work smoothly together.
Identifying Hardware Components in a 
Computer
At the most fundamental levels of a computer, the operating system interacts with 
internal hardware components to perform its computing tasks. How efficiently hard-
ware and software complete these tasks is called performance. Because a ­computer’s 
internal hardware components directly influence its performance, you should be 
familiar with these components and how they work together to process instructions 
from software.
The system unit is the case that contains a computer’s main system components, 
including the processor, memory, and the computer’s main circuit board, which is 
called the motherboard. A circuit board is a thin metal plate or board with an exten-
sive electronic circuit. All of the essential chips and the circuitry that connects them 
are on the motherboard. See Figure 2–1.

Lesson 2  Software and Hardware Interaction	
Mod1-35
Central Processing Unit
The main processing device in a computer is the processor, also called the micropro-
cessor, and the central processing unit (CPU), a single computer chip that contains 
all the electronic circuitry a computer needs to process data, making it the most 
important hardware component in a computer. A chip is a small, thin piece of sili-
con containing electronic circuits, which is why a chip is also called an integrated 
circuit (IC). The processor has a significant effect on a computer’s performance and 
computing power. Figure 2–2 shows a typical CPU.
1-2.1.1
central processing unit (CPU)
chip
Parts of a CPU
The CPU has two primary sections: the arithmetic/logic unit and the control unit. 
The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) performs arithmetic calculations and logical 
operations. The calculations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. The logical operations involve comparisons, such as determining if two 
numbers are equal or if one number is greater than or less than another num-
ber. These might seem like simple operations. However, by combining them, the 
ALU can execute complex tasks. For example, if you are playing a video game on 
your computer and earn points when you complete an action, the game software 
instructs the ALU to add those points to your previous score to compute your new 
score. The game software might also instruct the ALU to compare that score to 
other scores you recorded to determine whether your new score is the highest one 
you achieved.
The control unit coordinates all of the processor’s activities and manages the 
flow of information through the processor. The control unit interprets each instruc-
tion it receives from software, and then triggers the appropriate action to carry 
out the instruction. For example, if an application includes an instruction to multi-
ply two numbers, the control unit directs the task to the ALU, which performs the 
calculation.
The CPU also contains memory cells for temporarily storing data, including the 
registers, which mainly store the basic data the ALU needs to perform its calcula-
tions and the results of those calculations.

In 1971, Intel Corporation 
introduced a portable calculator 
that contained the first 
commercially available processor. 
Called the 4004, the processor 
could add and subtract numbers, 
but it could not do much else. 
Even so, the 4004 signaled a 
revolution in computing because 
on a single chip, it integrated all 
the electronic circuitry necessary 
to process data. Rather than 
reconfiguring an entire circuit 
board, engineers could easily 
­customize a single-chip processor 
with ­software to perform tasks 
on a wide range of electronic 
devices.

Machine Cycle
When software sends an instruction to the CPU, the CPU carries out the instruction 
by repeating four basic operations in the machine cycle: (1) fetching, (2) ­decoding, 
(3) executing, and (4) storing. Fetching retrieves an instruction or data item from 
memory, and decoding translates the instruction into a form the computer can 
execute. The fetching and decoding operations make up the instruction cycle 
(I-cycle). Executing carries out the commands in the instruction, while storing, 
in this context, means writing the result to memory (not to a storage medium). 
The executing and storing operations make up the execution cycle (E-cycle). See 
Figure 2–3. 
◗  Vocabulary

clock speed
For example, if software needs to add two numbers, as shown in Figure 2–3, 
it sends that instruction (add two numbers) and the input data (5 + 25) to mem-
ory, where the control unit in the CPU fetches them. The control unit completes 
the instruction cycle by decoding the instruction and data, and then passing them 
to the ALU. When the ALU receives the instruction and data, it executes the 
calculation, and then completes the execution cycle by storing the result (30) in 
memory. The software can retrieve the result and use it, such as by displaying it 
on the screen.
Clock Speed
Machine cycles are measured in microseconds (millionths of a second), ­nanoseconds 
(billionths of a second), and even picoseconds (trillionths of a second) on some large 
computers. The faster the machine cycle, the faster your computer processes data. 
The speed of the processor directly influences the speed of the machine cycle, and 
therefore, the overall performance of the computer. The processor’s speed is also 
called the clock speed, which indicates the number of instructions the CPU can 
­process per second.

Lesson 2  Software and Hardware Interaction	
Mod1-37
Every computer has a system clock that generates a regular electronic beat to set 
the pace and timing of system operations. Each beat of the system clock is called a 
cycle. For contemporary CPUs, clock speed is stated in megahertz (MHz), or a mil-
lion cycles per second, and gigahertz (GHz), or a billion cycles per second. (A hertz 
is one cycle per second.) A CPU that runs at 2 GHz completes 2 billion clock cycles 
in one second.
Bit Size
CPU clock speed is only one measure of CPU performance. Another measure 
is bit size, which indicates how many bytes of data the CPU can retrieve from 
RAM at once. A byte of data is roughly equivalent to one character, such as x. An 
8-bit CPU can process 1 byte at a time, while a 16-bit CPU can process 2 bytes 
at a time. Modern CPUs are 32-bit (4 bytes at once) and 64-bit (8 bytes at once) 
processors.
Types of Processors
The type of processor also significantly affects its performance and the perfor-
mance of the computer overall because it determines how quickly the computer 
can accept and carry out instructions from software. Different types of processors 
can use different techniques to process data and instructions as they complete the 
machine cycle. 
A multicore processor is a single chip that contains more than one processor, 
and includes dual-core processors (two processors on one chip) and quad-core pro-
cessors (four processors on one chip). If your operating system is designed to run 
with a multicore processor, its processors can boost the speed of the software so that 
it responds more quickly to your commands, especially when you are running mul-
tiple programs at the same time. 
If a computer has a multicore processor, the operating system can use 
­multiprocessing to split tasks among the processors. With multiprocessing, each 
processor can work on a different task at the same time, which improves perfor-
mance. In contrast, older computers and mobile computers often have a single-core 
processor, so they cannot use multiprocessing. To enhance performance using a 
­single-core processor, the operating system can use two other techniques: multitask-
ing and multithreading. Recall from Lesson 1 that a multitasking operating system 
can run more than one program at the same time. With multithreading, the operating 
system handles many parts, or threads, of a single program. For example, displaying 
a document and printing it are two threads in a word-processing program. Although 
the operating system still performs tasks in sequence rather than simultaneously, 
multitasking and multithreading are the most efficient processing techniques an 
operating system can use with a single-core processor. 
In short, on a computer with a multicore processor, the operating system can 
use multiprocessing, multitasking, and multithreading to improve performance. On a 
computer with a single-core processor, the operating system can use only multitask-
ing and multithreading.

Suppose you are using your computer to work on a presentation and you begin 
by starting a presentation application, such as Microsoft PowerPoint. You want to 
check some information online, so you open a Web browser (an application for 
visiting Web sites and displaying Web pages), and then navigate to the page you 
need. As you review the Web page, you check your e-mail, and then return to the 
presentation application to enter information based on what you learned. This 
typical scenario involves five major tasks: start a presentation application, open 
a Web browser, navigate to a Web page, check e-mail, and then enter information 
in the presentation. Figure 2–4 compares how these tasks are accomplished with 
an operating system using a single-core processor versus a multicore processor. 
With a single-core processor, shown at the top of Figure 2–4, the operating system 
completes the five tasks in five steps, performing one task in each step. With a 
multicore processor, shown at the bottom of Figure 2–4, the operating system 
can complete the five tasks in only three steps by working on some tasks at the 
same time. Processor 1 begins to open the presentation application, and then 
Processor  2 begins to open the Web browser. When both applications are open, 
Processor 1 checks e-mail while Processor 2 ­displays Web pages. When Processor 1 
is finished checking e-mail, it accepts information from the user and enters it in 
the presentation while Processor 2 is still displaying Web pages. When Processor 2 
finishes displaying Web pages, it is ready for the next task, which it can start while 
Processor 1 is busy entering information in the presentation.
Above and Beyond
Although most personal 
computers with multicore 
processors can improve 
performance through 
multiprocessing, very large, 
powerful computers called 
supercomputers use a similar 
technique called parallel 
processing. Rather than dividing 
tasks among processors, parallel 
processing assigns independent 
parts of the same task to 
different processors, which work 
on each part simultaneously. Of 
all the processing techniques, 
parallel processing can 
provide the greatest boost to 
performance. 
Currently, three major companies produce most of the CPUs for computers, 
including servers, personal, and mobile computers. Intel and AMD manufacture pro-
cessors for computers ranging from powerful servers to lightweight tablets. ARM 
Holdings produces ARM processors, which are exclusively for mobile computers.

The processor manufacturer also defines a computer’s platform. For example, a 
PC platform is a personal computer that includes a processor made by Intel or AMD 
and runs the Windows operating system. For this reason, the PC platform is some-
times called the Windows platform. 
Many Macs now have an Intel processor, which allows you to run some 
Windows and Linux software. The Linux platform uses a standard PC or Mac and 
does not require a certain type of processor, though it runs only software designed 
for the Linux operating system. 
Memory
To store data and instructions, the CPU, operating system, and applications use 
memory, which consists of chips inside the system unit. A computer has two major 
types of memory: volatile and nonvolatile. RAM is the most common type of 
­volatile memory, which loses its contents when you turn off the power to the com-
puter. ROM is an example of nonvolatile memory because it is permanent; it does 
not lose its contents when you turn off the power to the computer.
RAM
RAM is short-term memory, also called main memory and primary memory. Data, 
information, and instructions from applications and the operating system are stored 
temporarily in RAM, which is usually several chips on a circuit board called a 
­memory module that is plugged into the motherboard. Figure 2–5 shows a person 
installing a set of RAM chips on the motherboard.

thrashing
Above and Beyond
You can tell that an ­operating 
system is thrashing if the 
­computer does not respond 
when you press keys or move 
the mouse. You might also hear 
a soft grinding sound or the 
computer fan running constantly. 
To stop the thrashing, restart 
the computer by pressing the 
Ctrl+Alt+Del keys at the same 
time. If that doesn’t work, press 
the power button to turn the 
computer off. If the operating 
system continues to thrash, you 
probably need to purchase and 
install additional RAM.
The amount of RAM in your computer has a significant effect on perfor-
mance. If you have plenty of RAM, the operating system can manage memory 
easily and provide RAM as the CPU and applications request it. If you do not have 
enough RAM, the operating system must move data in and out of RAM frequently, 
which slows performance. The operating system can even spend more time swap-
ping data between RAM and virtual memory than running software, a condition 
called thrashing. A computer with a thrashing operating system is sluggish or 
completely unresponsive.

ROM
In contrast to RAM is read-only memory (ROM), which is stored on single chips 
on the motherboard, as shown in Figure 2–6. The operating system retrieves the 
data or programs stored in ROM when it needs them, such as when the com-
puter starts up. Unlike RAM, however, the operating system does not regularly 
write over the contents of ROM, which is why this type of memory is called 
read-only memory.
◗  Vocabulary
read-only memory (ROM)
electrically erasable 
programmable read-only memory 
(EEPROM)
flash memory
firmware
Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) is a type 
of ROM that is nonvolatile, but can be modified. Flash memory is a type of ROM 
that can be updated much more quickly than EEPROM and has largely replaced 
standard ROM in current computers, though all are sometimes called ROM. 
Because flash memory is so much faster than ROM or EEPROM, it is now being 
used on mobile computers and peripheral devices to store data such as songs and 
phone numbers. 
Recall from Lesson 1 that the BIOS is stored on a ROM chip, and it con-
tains instructions for starting the computer before the operating system is loaded. 
Because the ROM chip stores these instructions permanently, the chip is often called 
­firmware, a hybrid of hardware and software. 
If you change system components on your computer, by adding RAM, for exam-
ple, the BIOS must be updated to take the configuration changes into account. Some 
operating systems update the BIOS on the ROM chip automatically when you install 
the new hardware. In other cases, you or a computer technician can use the BIOS 
setup utility to make the changes, though you should do so cautiously. Selecting an 
incorrect setting could mean that your computer can no longer start.

Mod1-41
Caches
In addition to RAM, the CPU accesses memory caches (pronounced cashes) to 
speed processing. Because it takes longer to transfer data stored in RAM to the CPU 
than it takes the CPU to actually process the data, the CPU bypasses this bottleneck 
by storing a small amount of memory on the CPU itself, apart from the registers, 
where it is almost instantly available. This small amount of memory is called level 1 
cache memory.
Instead of waiting for data from RAM, the CPU also uses a larger amount of 
memory called level 2 cache memory. This memory can reside on the CPU itself or 
on a chip that has a direct connection to the CPU.
So far, you’ve learned about RAM, ROM, registers, and caches, which are types 
of memory for storing data. All of these elements fit together in a hierarchy, as shown 
in Figure 2–7. The closer instructions and data are to the CPU, the faster the CPU 
can process them.

Heat Sinks and Fans
Other hardware that indirectly affects computer performance are those that keep 
a computer cool. As components in the system unit receive power, they heat 
up. Processors in laptops, desktops, and servers generate a lot of heat. If these 
electronic components get too hot, they can cause damage to the component and 
instability to the system. As the temperature increases, the system slows down to 
avoid overheating, which severely impairs performance. To prevent overheating, 
one or more fans in the system unit draw cooler air into the case from the outside 
and expel warm air from the inside to keep the temperature within an ideal range. 
In many instances, such as the motherboard shown in Figure 2–1, the fan moves 
air across a heat sink, which collects heat from an electronic component so the 
fan can cool it quickly.
Quick Tip
Most tablets do not include fans 
because they have ­low-voltage 
components and no moving parts 
that are designed to remain cool 
as the computer runs.

Performance Indicators
You can tell how efficiently a computer is working by tracking its CPU and RAM 
usage. The lower the usage, the more efficiently the operating system is performing 
tasks. You can track CPU and RAM usage in Windows by using Task Manager, which 
is a tool that advanced Windows users work with to diagnose computer problems. 
Much of the information it provides is very technical and useful only to computer 
technicians. However, Task Manager also gives you a behind-the-scenes glimpse at 
how Windows is interacting with hardware resources and other software. In Task 
Manager, the tasks the processor handles are called processes. In Step-by-Step 2.1, 
you start Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer (the Web browser provided with 
Windows), and then open Task Manager to display the current processes and deter-
mine how many CPU and RAM resources Word and Internet Explorer are using. 
Make sure the computer is turned on and you are signed in to Windows (if 
­necessary) before you complete any of the Step-by-Steps in this lesson. In the fol-
lowing steps, you right-click the taskbar to display a shortcut menu. If you are 
using a mouse, point to the taskbar and then press the right mouse button to right-
click. If you are using a touchscreen, press and hold the taskbar until the shortcut 
menu appears.

The columns on the right show usage information for the CPU, memory, 
disk, and network. The CPU column shows the percentage of process-
ing resources each application and background process requires from 
the CPU to run, with the total percentage at the top of the column. For 
example, on the computer shown in Figure 2–10, the CPU is expend-
ing 3.3 percent of its resources to run Internet Explorer. All of the run-
ning processes combined require only 6 percent of the CPU’s resources, 
which means the CPU can handle many more tasks efficiently.
	
	
The Memory column shows the amount of RAM each item is using as it 
runs, with the total percentage at the top of the column. For example, 
on the computer shown in Figure 2–10, Internet Explorer requires the

Understanding System Requirements
When you purchase a computer, it comes with system software and application 
software. You add other applications to perform tasks and get the most out of the 
computer. If you can identify the characteristics and functions of the hardware com-
ponents in your computer, you can select the right software for your system. To 
do that, you need to compare an application’s system requirements to the computer 
system you are using. System requirements are hardware characteristics such as 
the amount of memory and speed of the processor. An application lists these hard-
ware specifications on the product’s box or Web site. Consider the specifications 
as minimum requirements. In other words, your computer should have the same or 
better characteristics as those listed in the system requirements. Figure 2–13 shows 
the system requirements for Microsoft Office, a group of applications that works 
­similarly and provides a variety of capabilities that allows you to create and work 
with documents, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations.

If your computer does not meet the application’s system requirements, the 
application will not be able to run or will run ineffectively. For example, one sys-
tem requirement is the version of the operating system. If the application requires 
Windows 7 or 8, you might not be able to run it on a computer with an earlier version 
of Windows, such as Windows XP. Another requirement is RAM. If your computer 
has less than the specified amount of RAM, you most likely cannot run the applica-
tion at all.
Above and Beyond
If you want to use the same 
applications or external devices 
on different computers, you need 
to make sure the ­computers 
are compatible, which means 
that they operate in the same 
way and run the same software. 
If ­computers have the same 
­platform, they are compatible.

Optional Hardware Requirements
Some applications include features designed for particular hardware. For exam-
ple, word-processing software might include a feature that accepts voice input 
from a microphone so you can speak commands instead of clicking buttons or 
narrate text instead of typing it. Many popular applications now include features 
that accept input from touchscreens so you can use a fingertip to select commands 
or handwrite text input. These are optional hardware requirements. You can use 
the software without the hardware, but having the hardware extends the features 
of the software.
In Step-by-Step 2.1, you started Microsoft Word, which provides most of its 
buttons on the Ribbon, a banner that stretches across the top of the Word window. 
(You thoroughly explore the Ribbon in Module 2.) You can display the Ribbon in 
one of two modes. The default Mouse Mode places the buttons close together on the 
Ribbon because you can move the pointer to a precise location and click a button 
when you use a mouse. The other mode is Touch Mode, which adapts the Ribbon for 
users of touchscreens. In Touch Mode, Word expands the space between buttons so 
you can use a fingertip to tap one button without touching another. To switch from 
one mode to another, you use the Quick Access Toolbar, a bar of buttons providing 
easy access to commands you use frequently.
In Step-by-Step 2.2, you turn Touch Mode on and off to see how application 
software can change depending on hardware settings.

Lesson 2  Software and Hardware Interaction	
Mod1-49
Software developers use version numbers to keep track of the software they 
release. The original software is assigned version 1.0. In general, the first ver-
sion of the software revised to include a patch or update is version 1.1, the next is 
­version 1.2, and so on. When developers make major improvements, add new fea-
tures, or change the software design, the new version is called an upgrade. The first 
upgrade is assigned version number 2.0, the next is version 3.0, and so on, with each 
subsequent upgrade numbered in sequence. Although developers provide software 
updates free of charge, you need to purchase a software upgrade. If you own a ver-
sion of the software, you can usually purchase the upgrade for less than the price 
charged to new users.
You can download most software—whether the original version, an update, 
or an upgrade—from the software developer’s Web site. Instructions for installing 
the software are provided on the Web site or included with the files you download. 
Installing means to move a copy of the software from its distribution location (such 
as a Web site) to your computer. As you install software, it sends requests to the 
operating system to change system settings as necessary to make sure the new soft-
ware runs with the current hardware and software on your computer.
System and application software often include tools for managing updates. 
Most provide an automatic update feature, which automatically checks for software 
updates and then downloads them when they are available. For operating system 
updates, Microsoft, Apple, and other developers recommend that you use the auto-
matic update feature to ensure that your computer has the software it needs to run 
smoothly and reliably.
Above and Beyond
A Web application, also called a 
Web app, is an application stored 
on a server connected to the 
Internet that you access using 
a browser. Web apps designed 
for business are also called 
Software as a Service (SaaS). 
Because you work with Web apps 
directly on a Web site, you do 
not need to update them; the 
software developers keep them 
up to date. In addition, you do 
not need to check the platform 
or system requirements or install 
the software. If your browser can 
access the Web site, and you 
pay a ­subscription fee or sign 
in, you can use the application. 
You can find Web apps for word 
processing, creating and ­editing 
­graphics, sharing photos and 
videos, and much more.

Updating Software
The software development organizations that create and distribute system and 
application software are constantly changing their software to keep up with hard-
ware developments and user requests. For example, if the manufacturer of a digital 
media device such as an iPod upgrades the device or releases a new model, the 
operating system needs a new copy of the driver so it can properly control the 
device. In addition, software users might report problems, or bugs, when using 
the software with a certain type of hardware or under certain conditions. Users 
or developers might also discover problems with security that could allow unau-
thorized users to access your computer and its data. In these cases, the software 
is revised to address the problems. If you purchased the original version of the 
software, or if it came preinstalled on your computer, you can download a patch, 
update, or service pack from the Internet to include the latest revisions in your 
copy of the software. Table 2–1 describes each of these, which are collectively 
called software updates.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Most automatic updates take place in the background, so you can continue 
working on the computer without interruption as the update is downloaded and 
installed. However, many updates, especially those to the operating system, 
require you to restart the computer after installing the update. To avoid restart-
ing, you can turn off the automatic installation feature for noncritical updates 
and install them yourself. (You’ll learn how to turn off this feature in Windows in 
Step-by-Step 2.3.) Windows and other operating systems remind you to install the 
updates you’ve downloaded. For software other than operating systems, you can 
turn off automatic updating altogether and use the manual update feature instead. 
When performing a manual update, you download and install the updates your-
self. In some cases, you must visit the software developer’s Web site, and then 
search for the update. More common is to set the update feature to notify you 
when updates are available so you don’t miss any important updates. Figure 2–17 
shows part of an iPhone screen with applications ready to be updated. The red 
circle on the App Store icon represents eight software updates that are ready to be 
downloaded.
Above and Beyond
Operating system updates 
often include updates to device 
­drivers. However, if you are 
having trouble with a piece of 
hardware, you can update the 
driver on your own. To do so, visit 
the device manufacturer’s Web 
site. Typically, you can enter the 
model number of the device in a 
Search box to display ­technical 
support information about the 
device, including information 
about updates. Look for an 
update created for your operating 
system, and then click a button 
to download the software and 
installation instructions to your 
computer. Follow the ­instructions 
to install the driver on your 
system.

Updating Operating Systems
Personal and mobile operating systems provide tools to keep the operating system 
up to date by contacting a server and then downloading the files containing the 
updates. The tools let you select settings for how and when to update the operating 
system. After configuring the update tool, you update the operating system in one of 
the following ways depending on the settings you selected:
n 
If you choose to download and install updates automatically, your updating 
tasks are complete—the operating system takes care of updates as they become 
available.
n	
If you choose to download the updates automatically, but install them yourself, 
the operating system notifies you that it downloaded updates and reminds you to 
install them.

As it installs an update, a personal operating system provides tools to reverse 
the update in case it causes unforeseen problems. In Windows, this tool is called a 
system restore point; in Mac OS X, it is called the Time Machine.
In Windows, you use Windows Update to check for the latest updates to 
Windows and to review your update settings. Windows Update can download three 
types of updates, which are described in Table 2–2.

Windows Update
You can set Windows to download and install important and recommended 
updates automatically. (You can only download and install optional updates manu-
ally.) You can also indicate when Windows should install the updates. To let you 
know that updates are available or that Windows is ready to download or install 
updates, a message appears on the Welcome screen indicating that updates are avail-
able or will be installed within a set timeframe. If you’ve set up automatic updating, 
Windows will download and install the update as you work on your computer. If 
restarting your computer is necessary to complete the update, Windows waits until 
you’re finished with your work before restarting your computer. If your computer 
task takes up the entire screen, such as when you’re watching a movie, Windows 
waits until you are finished with that task.
In Step-by-Step 2.3, you open Windows Update and review its options without 
changing any settings. Windows Update is a tool provided in the Control Panel, a 
window containing specialized tools you use to change the way Windows looks and 
behaves. If you are working in a computer lab and are not allowed to use the Control 
Panel, read but do not perform the following steps.

Malware
One of the most important reasons to keep an operating system up to date is to protect it from malicious 
software, or malware. Especially when you connect to the Internet, your computer is vulnerable to harm 
from people who might try to steal your personal information, damage your data, or interrupt your work. 
Malware includes viruses, programs that copy themselves onto your computer, typically from a Web site, 
and then run to infect your computer. The damage a virus can cause ranges from changing your settings 
to corrupting your operating system. In addition to keeping your operating system up to date, you should 
install an antivirus application, software designed to block and remove viruses from your computer before 
it can become infected, and keep it up to date.
People who create and send malware are called hackers, and includes anyone who intends to access a 
computer system without permission. Hackers with illegal intent are called crackers or black-hat hackers. 
Others are actually hired by organizations who want to protect their systems from malware and data theft. 
These types of hackers are called white-hat or ethical hackers, and their aim is to find and fix security 
vulnerabilities before black-hat hackers can exploit them.

Lesson 2  Software and Hardware Interaction	
Mod1-55
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
The characteristics and capabilities of a computer’s internal 
hardware components directly influence computer performance.
n 
The system unit is the case that contains a computer’s main 
system components, including the motherboard, the processor, 
and memory. All of the essential chips and the circuitry that 
connects them are on the motherboard.
n 
The internal hardware that processes data is the processor, 
also called the microprocessor and the central processing unit 
(CPU), a single computer chip that contains all the electronic 
circuitry for performing a personal computer’s processing 
tasks. The processor has a significant effect on a computer’s 
performance and computing power.
n 
The CPU has two primary sections: the arithmetic/logic unit 
(ALU) and the control unit. The ALU performs arithmetic cal-
culations and logical operations. The control unit coordinates 
all of the processor’s activities and manages the flow of infor-
mation through the processor.
n 
The CPU carries out each instruction it receives from software 
by repeating four basic operations, which comprise the machine 
cycle: fetching, decoding, executing, and storing. The fetching 
and decoding operations make up the instruction cycle. The 
executing and storing operations make up the execution cycle.
n 
The clock speed indicates the number of instructions the CPU 
can process per second. The clock speed directly influences the 
speed of the machine cycle, and therefore, the overall perfor-
mance of the computer. 
n 
The type of processor in a computer affects how quickly the 
computer can accept and carry out instructions from software. 
A multicore processor is a single chip that contains more than 
one processor, such as dual-core processors and quad-core 
processors. 
n 
If a computer has a multicore processor, the operating system 
can use multiprocessing to split tasks among the processors. 
With multiprocessing, each processor can work on a different 
task at the same time.
n 
On a computer with a single-core processor, the operating sys-
tem can use multitasking and multithreading. A multitasking 
operating system can run more than one program at the same 
time. A multithreading operating system handles many parts, 
or threads, of a single program.
n 
To store data and instructions, the CPU, operating system, and 
applications use memory, which consists of chips inside the 
system unit. A computer has two major types of memory: vola-
tile memory such as RAM and nonvolatile memory such as 
ROM. Volatile memory loses its contents when you turn off the 
power to the computer, while nonvolatile memory is perma-
nent and does not lose its contents when you turn off the power 
to the computer.
n 
The amount of RAM in your computer has a significant effect 
on performance. If you do not have enough RAM, the oper-
ating system must move data in and out of RAM frequently, 
which slows performance. If the operating system spends more 
time swapping data between RAM and virtual memory than 
running software, it is said to be thrashing, which makes the 
computer sluggish or completely unresponsive.
n 
ROM is stored on single chips attached to the motherboard. 
The operating system retrieves the data or programs stored in 
ROM when it needs them, such as when the computer starts 
up. ROM is read-only memory because the operating system 
does not regularly write over its contents.
n 
EEPROM and flash memory are types of ROM that are non-
volatile, but can be modified. 
n 
If you change system components on your computer, by 
adding RAM, for example, the BIOS stored on a ROM chip 
must be updated to take these configuration changes into 
account.
n 
In addition to RAM, the CPU accesses memory caches to 
speed processing. The small amount of memory stored on the 
CPU itself, apart from the registers, is called level 1 cache 
memory. Level 2 cache memory is a larger amount of memory 
that can reside on the CPU or on a chip that has a direct con-
nection to the CPU.
n 
You can tell how efficiently a computer is working by track-
ing its CPU and RAM usage. The lower the usage, the more 
efficiently the operating system is performing tasks. In 
Windows, you use Task Manager to track CPU and RAM 
usage.
n 
Applications have system requirements, which are hardware 
specifications such as the amount of memory and speed of the 
processor. If your computer does not meet the application’s 
system requirements, the application will not be able to run or 
will run ineffectively.
n 
Some applications include features designed for special hard-
ware such as touchscreens, which allow you to use a fingertip 
to select commands or handwrite text input. Microsoft Word 
includes a button that lets you switch to Touch Mode, which 
adapts the Ribbon for users of touchscreens.
n 
Software developers are constantly updating system and 
application software to keep up with hardware innovations 
and changes, user requests, and security threats. They release 
updated software as a patch, update, or service pack.
n 
When developers make major improvements to software, add 
new features, or change the design, the new version is called an 
upgrade. The first upgrade is assigned version number 2.0, the 
next is version 3.0, and so on.

Mod1-62	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
To work productively with a computer, you need to know how to organize and find 
files. Because Windows is the most popular operating system on personal computers,  
this lesson explains how to use Windows tools to manage files. You’ll learn how 
to navigate the Windows file structure and change settings for viewing files. You’ll 
also learn how to copy, move, delete, and rename files. To make sure you can find 
the files you need, you’ll also create shortcuts and search for files. Finally, you’ll 
­identify file types so you are prepared for what happens when you open a file.
Understanding How Windows Stores Files
A file is a collection of data stored together. A report document, a photo of your pet, 
a recording of your favorite band singing “Happy Birthday,” and a video demonstrat-
ing how to bake a cake from scratch—all of these are files. You store files in folders, 
which are containers for related files, and on drives, which are storage devices. You 
use folders to organize your files on a drive.
Drives contain certain types of disks, which are storage media, including remov-
able media and hard disks. Removable media are disks that you insert or attach to a 
computer, such as USB drives (also called flash drives and thumb drives) and digital 
video discs (DVDs). The term hard disk refers to a disk installed in the system unit 
that can store many gigabytes of data economically. 
Before your computer can access a removable disk, you must insert the disk into 
a drive. A hard disk is housed in a drive inside the computer, so you don’t need to 
insert a hard disk before a computer can access it. An external hard disk, however, is 
contained in a removable drive that you can attach to your computer.
Windows names the drives on the computer by assigning each a drive letter. The 
hard drive containing the operating system is named drive C by default. The remain-
ing drives can have any other letter from D to Z, but are usually assigned in the order 
that the drives were installed on the computer. For example, the DVD drive might 
be drive D and USB drives might be drive E, drive F, and drive G. See Figure 3–1.
Quick Tip
You learn more about storage 
devices and media in Lesson 5.

Above and Beyond
Why does Windows start assigning 
drive letters with drive C? Early 
PCs had a drive A and a drive B, 
both for floppy disks, which 
originally were 5.25-inch remov-
able disks in a coated paper 
sleeve that were actually flexible, 
hence the name “floppy disks.” 
They were replaced by 3.5-inch 
removable disks encased in hard 
plastic, but they still were called 
floppy disks. Although computers 
no longer have floppy disk drives, 
Windows continues to follow the 
convention of assigning the first 
hard disk to drive C.

lesson 3  Windows File Management	
Mod1-63 
By convention, Windows includes a colon (:) after each drive letter. For exam-
ple, your hard drive might be named Local Disk (C:).
Windows stores thousands of files in many folders on the hard disk of your 
computer. These are system files that Windows needs to display the Start screen and 
desktop, access drives, and perform other operating system tasks. To keep the system 
stable and to find files quickly, Windows organizes the folders and files in a structure, 
or hierarchy, called a file system. At the top of the file system is the root ­directory, 
which is where Windows stores folders and important files that it needs when you 
turn on the computer. These folders contain other folders, also called ­subfolders, in 
which you can store your own files. See Figure 3–2.
Although you can access almost any folder on your computer, including the 
root directory, you should store your documents, music, videos, and other files 
in subfolders, not in the root directory or other folder containing system files. 
In fact, most operating systems, including Windows, limit your access to criti-
cal files and folders in the root directory so you cannot inadvertently corrupt the 
file system.

Using File Explorer
Most operating systems include a file management tool that you use to organize your 
files. In Windows 8, this tool is File Explorer. (In previous versions of Windows, 
this tool was called Windows Explorer.) As shown in Figure 3–3, File Explorer dis-
plays the contents of your computer, using icons to represent drives, folders, and 
files. You use File Explorer to display files and folders, navigate the Windows file 
system, and perform other file management tasks.

lesson 3  Windows File Management	
Mod1-65 
Above and Beyond
The file management tool in 
Mac OS X is named Finder. Each 
distribution of Linux comes with 
a file manager, such as Nautilus 
for Ubuntu and Dolphin for KDE. 
All are similar to File Explorer.
When you start File Explorer, it opens to show folders, devices, and drives on 
your computer as in Figure 3–3. Windows provides four of these folders for your per-
sonal files: the Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders. The Desktop folder 
provides access to system resources such as the Recycle Bin, which you use later in 
this lesson when deleting files. The Downloads folder is for files you download, or 
copy, from the Internet and other networks. Devices and drives include the drives 
installed in your computer and any devices or drives attached to your computer. 
Folder Navigation
To work with files and folders, you must first display them in the File Explorer win-
dow. An easy way to do so is to use the Navigation pane. When you select an icon 
in the Navigation pane, its contents are displayed in the right pane. For example, 
when you select the This PC icon in the Navigation pane, the right pane displays 
the folders, devices, and drives on your computer. When you select a folder in the 
Navigation pane, the contents of that folder appear in the right pane.
The Navigation pane does not have enough space to show all the folders and 
subfolders on your computer at the same time. Instead, you open drives and ­folders 
only when you want to see what they contain. If a folder contains undisplayed sub-
folders, an expand icon appears to the left of the folder icon. The same is true for 
drives. To view the subfolders contained in a folder, you click the expand icon. 
A collapse icon then appears next to the folder icon; click the collapse icon to hide 
the folder’s subfolders. To view the files contained in a folder, you click the folder  
icon, and the files appear in the right pane. You can also double-click any device, 
drive, or folder in the right pane to display its contents.
In addition to the Navigation pane, the Address bar in File Explorer provides the 
following shortcuts for navigating to locations on your computer:
n 
Back button—After you navigate to a folder, click the Back button to return to 
your previous location.
n 
Forward button—The Forward button becomes available only after you click the 
Back button. If you navigate first to the Pictures folder, for example, and then 
to a folder named Grand Canyon, you can click the Back button to return to the 
Pictures folder. When you do, you can click the Forward button to open the next 
location in the sequence of folders, which is the Grand Canyon folder.
n 
Recent locations button—Click the Recent locations button to navigate to a 
location you’ve visited since you opened File Explorer.
n 
Up one level button—Click the Up one level button to navigate up to the folder 
containing the current folder. The ScreenTip for this button changes to reflect 
the folder to which you can navigate. For example, when you are working in the 
Pictures folder, the ScreenTip is Up to “This PC”.
n 
Address box—The Address box displays your current folder as a series of loca-
tions separated by arrow buttons. Click a folder name such as Pictures or an 
arrow button to quickly navigate to a different location.
You use the Navigation pane and the Address bar in Step-by-Step 3.1 to explore 
your computer. First, you open File Explorer on the Windows desktop, and then dis-
play the contents of the Pictures folder, which is designed to contain your photos and 
other pictures. You compare that location to the Pictures library. A library displays 
similar types of files together, no matter where they are stored, so you can access 
them easily. In contrast, a folder stores files in a specific location. In the case of the 
Pictures folder, this location is usually a folder on Local Disk (C:).

Like the Pictures folder, the Pictures library displays various folders and files 
containing images, such as photos. In addition, the Pictures library always provides 
special tools for working with pictures. When you navigate to the Pictures library, 
the Picture Tools Manage tab and the Library Tools Manage tab appear to the right 
of the standard Ribbon tabs (named File, Home, Share, and View). This type of tab 
is called a contextual tab, and it contains options related to your current task or loca-
tion. The Pictures Tools Manage tab also appears when you select an image file in 
the Pictures folder.

Navigating to Your Data Files
Many of the lessons in this book involve data files, which are files you use in the 
Step-by-Steps and the exercises at the end of each lesson. Typically, your instructor 
gives you the data files, often on a USB drive, or asks you to obtain the data files 
on your own from a location such as a drive on the school’s network. The data files 
for this lesson are provided in a subfolder named Lesson 3, which is contained in a 
folder named Module 1. One of the files in the Lesson 3 folder is named Basics.docx. 
If the Module 1 folder is stored on a USB drive named Removable Disk E:, you 
could refer to the Basics.docx data file using the following notation:
Removable Disk (E:) ▶ Module 1 ▶ Lesson 3 ▶ Basics.docx

This notation is called the file path, and it indicates where a file is stored on 
your computer by leading you through the folder and file organization to your file. 
This file path has the following parts:
n 
Removable Disk E:—The drive name followed by a colon, which indicates a 
drive rather than a folder
n 
Module 1—A top-level folder on drive E
n 
Lesson 3—A subfolder in the Module 1 folder
n 
Basics.docx—The full filename of the file
A full filename includes three parts: the main part of the filename, which is 
­provided by the creator of the file; the dot, or period, which separates the main part 
from the file extension; and the file extension, which is usually three or four char-
acters that identify the file type. In the Basics.docx filename, the .docx extension 
identifies the file as one created in Microsoft Word.
In Step-by-Step 3.2, you use your folder navigation skills to navigate to the data 
files for this lesson. The following steps assume these files are stored on a USB drive 
named Removable Disk E:. If your files are stored in another location or on a drive 
with a different name, substitute that location or name for “Removable Disk E:” in 
the steps.

Changing View Settings
Using File Explorer, you can view the contents of a folder in eight ways: Extra large 
icons, Large icons, Medium icons, Small icons, List, Details, Tiles, and Content. The 
default view for the Pictures folder is Large icons view, which provides a thumbnail 
image of the file contents for files containing graphics. When you display files con-
taining graphics in Medium icons view or larger, the icon displays a preview of the 
file’s content. For other folders, the default view is Details view, which displays a 
small icon instead of a thumbnail and lists details about each file. 
Windows and other operating systems keep track of file details, which typically 
include the filename, file type, size, and date the file was created or modified. These 
file details can be seen in different views in File Explorer. In addition to the filename, 
the file type, or file format, indicates the type of data in the file. For example, a file 
with a PNG (for Portable Network Graphics) or JPG (for Joint Photographic Expert 
Graphics) file type contains graphics such as an illustration or photo. Some file types 
reflect the application used to create the file. For example, a file with a Microsoft 
Word Document file type was created using Microsoft Word. The file size indicates 
how much data the file contains. The data is measured in kilobytes (KB). One KB 
contains 1,024 characters, which is fairly small. For example, this paragraph con-
tains about 1,000 characters. Graphics files usually contain much more data than a 
text file.
To change the File Explorer view setting to any of the eight views, you use the 
View tab on the Ribbon. To switch to Details view or Large icons view, you can use 
the view buttons on the status bar. You’ll use both methods in Step-by-Step 3.3.

Managing Files
Managing files involves tasks that help you find files when you need them. These tasks 
include organizing the files into folders, deleting unnecessary files, and naming or 
renaming files so you can easily recognize their contents. To organize files, you group 
similar files together in a folder, preferably a subfolder in one of the Windows default 
folders, such as Pictures for graphics and Documents for text files. You should sepa-
rate the files into subfolders depending on the purpose or subject matter of the files, 
and organize the subfolders from the top down. For example, a Courses folder might 
be a subfolder in the Documents folder. Within the Courses folder is a subfolder for 
each course you are taking, similar to the organization in Figure 3–9.

Mod1-72	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Windows creates default folders only on the hard drive, not on removable media. 
If you are working with files on removable media, such as a USB drive, you can use 
folders stored in the root directory of the removable drive. For example, instead of 
using the Courses folder stored in the Documents folder on Local Disk (C:), you 
could use the Courses folder stored on Removable Disk (E:).
Do not store your files in the root directory of the hard disk, a folder containing 
system files (usually named Windows), or a folder containing software files (any 
folder in the Program Files or Program Files (x86) folder). Windows expects to 
find system files and the files for specific applications within certain folders. If you 
reorganize or change these folders, Windows can’t locate and start the applications 
stored in those folders. 
Creating Folders
Before you organize files, you must create folders to contain the files. You use 
File Explorer to create folders. (You use applications to create files.) Consider 
the data files for this lesson that are stored in the Lesson 3 folder. Basics and 
Notes are Microsoft Word files containing information about managing files. 
Earth, Flower, and Harmony are graphics files displaying Windows desktop 
backgrounds. Welcome and Sample are Microsoft PowerPoint files that show how 
to use some features of PowerPoint, an application you use to create presentations 
and slide shows. Organize is a PowerPoint file that explains how to organize files 
and folders in Windows.
One way to organize these files is to create three folders—one for file manage-
ment, one for desktop background graphics, and another for learning PowerPoint. 
When you create a folder, you give it a name, preferably one that describes its 
contents. A folder name can have up to 255 characters. Any character is allowed, 
except / \ : * ? “ < > and |. Considering these rules, you could create three folders 
containing files as follows:
n	
Backgrounds folder—Earth, Flower, and Harmony files
n	
File Management folder—Basics, Notes, and Organize files
n	
Learning PowerPoint folder—Sample and Welcome files
If you were organizing these files on a hard disk, you could create the 
Backgrounds subfolder in the Pictures folder. However, in Step-by-Step 3.4, you 
create folders on a removable disk, so you will create the three folders in the 
Lesson 3 folder. You will use File Explorer to create these folders using three 
methods: the Home tab on the Ribbon, a shortcut menu, and the Quick Access 
Toolbar. A shortcut menu is a menu that appears when you right-click an object 
on the screen. Shortcut menus list commands you can use with the object you 
right-clicked. For example, when you right-click the File Explorer window, the 
shortcut menu includes commands for working with files, such as changing the 
view of the window and creating a folder.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
To organize files into folders, you can copy or move the files. Copying places a 
duplicate of a file in a new location that you specify, which is the destination folder. 
Moving removes a file from its current location and places it in the destination folder. 
As with creating folders, File Explorer provides several methods for copy-
ing and moving files and folders. Some methods use the Clipboard, a temporary 
­storage area for files and information that you copy or move from one place and 
plan to use somewhere else. Table 3–2 summarizes the methods for copying and 
moving files and folders.

Deleting Files and Folders
You should periodically delete files and folders you no longer need to stay organized and 
reduce the clutter on your disks. You delete a file or folder in File Explorer by deleting 
its icon. When you delete a file from a hard disk, Windows removes the file from the 
folder but stores the file contents in the Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin is an area on your 
hard disk that holds deleted files until you remove them permanently. When you delete a 
folder from the hard disk, the folder and all of its files are stored in the Recycle Bin. If you 
change your mind and want to retrieve a deleted file or folder, you can double-click the 
Recycle Bin icon on the desktop to display deleted files in File Explorer, right-click the 
file or folder you want to retrieve, and then click Restore on the shortcut menu. However, 
after you empty the Recycle Bin, you can no longer recover the files it contained.
In Step-by-Step 3.6, you delete the extra copies of the Organize file from the 
Learning PowerPoint folder and the Lesson 3 folder. (The File Management folder 
also contains a copy of the Organize file.) You’ll delete the file using a shortcut menu 
and using the Delete key. At this point, File Explorer should display the contents of 
the Learning PowerPoint folder. If it does not, navigate to the Learning PowerPoint 
folder before performing the following steps.

Quick Tip
Some removable disks have 
Recycle Bins, but many do not. 
In most cases, a file you delete 
on a USB drive does not go into 
a Recycle Bin. Instead, Windows 
deletes the file when it removes 
the file icon, and you cannot 
recover the file.
Step-by-Step 3.6
	 1.	 In File Explorer, click the Organize file to select it, right-click the 
Organize file, and then click Delete on the shortcut menu to delete 
the file. If a dialog box appears asking if you’re sure you want to delete 
the file, click the Yes button.
	 2.	 Navigate to the Lesson 3 folder, and then click the Organize file to select it. 
	 3.	 Press the Delete key to delete the file, and then click the Yes button, if 
necessary, to confirm you want to delete the file.

Mod1-77 
Renaming Files
Like folder names, filenames should reflect the contents of the file. The main part of 
a filename can have up to 255 characters, which is plenty of characters for a descrip-
tive filename. You should be able to recognize the contents of a file by looking at the 
filename. You can use spaces and certain punctuation symbols in your filenames, but 
not the symbols / \ : * ? “ < > or | because these characters have special meanings 
in Windows.
Keep the following guidelines in mind as you name files:
n	
Use descriptive names—Avoid names that might make sense now but could 
cause confusion later, such as MyFile or Info. Use filenames that are long 
enough to be meaningful, but short enough to be read easily on the screen.
n	
Do not change the file extension—If you change the file extension when naming 
a file, Windows might not be able to find a program that can open it.
n	
Follow a pattern—If possible, use a consistent naming scheme that is clear to you. 
For example, if you store many assignments in the same folder, the first assign-
ment file could be named Assignment01, the next Assignment02, and so on.
Be sure to give your files meaningful names that will help you remember 
their purpose and contents. The easiest way to rename a file is to use the Rename 
command on the file’s shortcut menu. You can also use the Rename button in the 
Organize group on the Home tab. In Step-by-Step 3.7, you rename the files in 
the File Management folder so the filenames are more descriptive.
1-1.2.2
Step-by-Step 3.7
	 1.	 Open the File Management folder to display its contents, and make sure 
you are in Large icons view so you have more room for renaming files.
	 2.	 Right-click the Basics file, and then click Rename on the shortcut 
menu. The filename is selected in a text box as shown in Figure 3–13 so 
you can type to enter a new name.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Creating Shortcuts
In Windows, a shortcut is an icon or tile that provides a quick way to perform an 
action such as opening a folder or a file. You can create shortcuts in two places: on 
the Start screen and on the desktop. If you often use a folder soon after you sign in to 
Windows, you can add, or pin, the folder to the Start screen, where it appears as a 
tile. Instead of displaying the desktop, starting File Explorer, and then navigating to 
the folder you want, you can click the folder’s tile on the Start screen to immediately 
open the folder on the desktop.
In Step-by-Step 3.8, you pin the Backgrounds folder to the Start screen. You can 
pin folders located on the hard disk to the Start screen, but not folders on removable 
media such as a USB drive. Before you can pin the Backgrounds folder to the Start 
screen, you’ll copy it to the Pictures folder on your hard disk. If you are working 
in a computer lab and are not allowed to access the Pictures folder, read but do not 
perform the following steps.

Mod1-79 
In addition to creating shortcuts on the Start screen by pinning folders, you can 
create shortcuts on the desktop to access drives, folders, files, Web pages, applica-
tions, or other computer resources, such as a network location. For example, you can 
open a folder directly from the desktop by creating a shortcut icon for the folder. You 
can double-click the shortcut icon on the desktop to open the folder, the same way 
that you double-click a folder icon in File Explorer. However, a shortcut icon is only 
a link to the actual folder. If you move the icon, you move only the shortcut, not the 
folder itself. If your desktop becomes cluttered, you can delete the shortcut icons 
without affecting the original folders, files, or other items. You can tell the differ-
ence between shortcut icons and other icons because shortcut icons include a curved 
arrow in the lower-left part of the icon.
An easy way to create a shortcut is to use the Send to command on the shortcut 
menu for a file, folder, or drive. In Step-by-Step 3.9, you use this technique to create 
a shortcut to the Learning PowerPoint folder on the desktop.
Step-by-Step 3.9
	 1.	 Open the Lesson 3 folder to display its contents.
	 2.	 Right-click the Learning PowerPoint folder, point to Send to, and then 
click Desktop (create shortcut). 
	 3.	 If necessary, click the Minimize button 
 in any open window to dis-
play the shortcut on the desktop. See Figure 3–15.

Searching for Files
Now that you’ve learned basic folder organization and navigation, you can easily find 
files if you know where they are stored. After navigating to that location, you can scan 
the file list to find a file. However, if your folders contain many files or you’re not 
sure where a file is stored, you can use the Search box in File Explorer to find a file.

Mod1-80	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
The Search box appears next to the Address bar in the File Explorer window. To 
find a file in the current folder or any of its subfolders, you start typing text associ-
ated with the file into the Search box. Usually, this search text is part of the filename, 
though you can also search using tags, which are keywords you associate with a file. 
As you enter the search text, Windows searches for files by examining the names of 
the files displayed in the current folder and files in its subfolders. If Windows finds 
a file whose filename contains a word starting with the search text you specify, it 
displays that file in the File Explorer window. For example, you might use the search 
text “note” to find the File Management Notes file.
If you are searching a hard drive, Windows also looks for files containing a word 
starting with your search text. For example, using “note” as the search text also finds 
the File Explorer Basics file on a hard drive because it contains the text “Take note 
of common file management problems.” If you are searching a removable drive, by 
default Windows searches filenames only. 
In Step-by-Step 3.10, you search the Lesson 3 folder for a file containing “flow” 
in its filename. The following steps assume you are searching a folder stored on a 
removable disk.
Quick Tip
The name of the Search box 
reflects the folder or drive you 
are searching. If you open the 
Pictures folder, for example, 
the Search box name is Search 
Pictures.
Step-by-Step 3.10
	 1.	 Navigate to the Lesson 3 folder to display its contents.
	 2.	 Click in the Search Lesson 3 box, and then type f. Windows exam-
ines the files in the subfolders of the Lesson 3 folder, searching for 
a filename that includes a word starting with “f.” The one folder and 
four files in the Lesson 3 folder that do so are displayed in the search 
results. You can continue typing to narrow the selection.
	 3.	 Type low after the “f” so that the search text is now “flow.” Windows 
displays the Flower file in the search results. See Figure 3–16.
Quick Tip
If you are searching a hard drive, 
more than four files appear in the 
search results because Windows 
is searching the contents of the 
files in addition to filenames.

Understanding File Types
A computer can contain three categories of files: system files, application files, and data 
files. System files are those necessary for running the operating system. They usually are 
found in the root directory of a personal computer and in the Windows folder of a Windows 
computer. On a Mac, system files are stored in the System folder. Linux computers keep 
system files in a folder named sys. An application file is part of an application, such as a 
word-processing application, and is a necessary file for running the software. These files 
are transferred to your computer when you install the application. A data file is one you 
create when working with an application, such as a document you write and format when 
working with Microsoft Word. Many system and application files are executable files, 
which means they can perform tasks automatically when you open them. In contrast, data 
files display data such as text or images, or play a sound, music, or a video.
Recall that a file extension identifies the file type. It also identifies the broader 
category to which the file belongs. The system file category has the fewest file types. 
System files often have attributes set so they cannot be edited or deleted because 
those files are critical to computer operation. (A file attribute is a file detail or setting 
that can be turned on or off.) System files come only as part of the operating system 
or other system software. In a similar way, application files come only as part of 
software. Do not move, edit, or delete system or application files unless a computer 
expert gives you specific instructions to do so. 
On the other hand, data files are designed for you to create, edit, and manage. 
You can learn valuable information about a file from the information listed in the 
Type column of File Explorer in Details view or from its file extension. For example, 
suppose you have two files named Get Organized, as shown in Figure 3–17.

WARNING
Unless you receive an executable  
file (one with an extension 
such as .exe) from a source 
you trust, do not open the file 
by double-clicking it. Doing so 
could trigger a virus or other 
malware to run on your computer 
with harmful results.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
File Explorer identifies one of the files as a Microsoft Word Document; this file 
type has a .docx extension. File Explorer identifies the other file as a PNG file, which 
is a graphics file; this file type has a .png extension. Though the main parts of these 
filenames are identical, the file types distinguish them as different files. 
The file extension also helps Windows identify what application should open the 
file. For example, if you double-click a file named Class Notes.docx in File Explorer, 
Microsoft Word opens the file so you can edit it. If the Type column in File Explorer 
includes the name of an application, that indicates the application is installed on your 
computer and is available to open the file. (If something is wrong with the file—if you 
change the file extension, for example—the application probably cannot open the file.) 
For some file types, especially media files such as graphics, audio, and video, 
Windows does not identify an application, but lists the file extension in the Type col-
umn of File Explorer. These file types are not associated with a specific application, 
which can make it difficult to predict what happens when you double-click the files. 
Double-clicking a png file, for example, might open an application that only lets 
you view the picture or one that lets you edit it. When you need to specify an appli-
cation to open a file, you can right-click the file, point to Open with on the shortcut 
menu, and then click the name of the application that you want to use.
You should be able to recognize common file types and their file extensions so 
you know which files to avoid (system and application files) and to identify appli-
cations you can use to open files. Table 3–3 lists typical file types by category and 
identifies their file extensions and associated operating system or application.
Above and Beyond
When you create and save a file, 
the application you are using 
adds the extension automatically. 
However, although Windows keeps 
track of extensions, by default, 
it is not set to display them. To 
display file extensions in File 
Explorer, click the View tab, and 
then click the File name exten-
sions check box in the Show/hide 
group to insert a check mark. 
When you select this check box, 
Windows includes file extensions 
for any file listed in File Explorer. 
Above and Beyond
The file type created by an appli-
cation is called its native file 
format. When you save a file, the 
application uses its native file 
format by default to save the file. 
An application can always open 
a file in its native file format. 
In addition, it can open several 
other types of files. You can 
identify these file types in the 
application’s Open dialog box, 
which usually includes a button 
or other control you can click to 
list the file types.

lesson 3  Windows File Management	
Mod1-83 
Computer Support Specialist
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, careers in the technology field are among the fastest growing 
in the nation. If you like to work with people and have an affinity for technology (an unusual combination), 
you can enter the technology field as a computer support specialist. 
Also called technical support specialists or help desk technicians, computer support specialists assist 
computer users by offering advice on using computers and software and by troubleshooting computer 
problems. Much of the advice is basic file management knowledge. As a computer support specialist, you 
might work within an organization and provide help to other employees, or you might work for a technology 
organization and assist general computer users on the phone.
Some organizations require a bachelor’s degree for their computer support specialists, while others 
require only an associate’s degree or post-secondary school classes. Most organizations expect workers in this 
position to keep up with technology by attending training programs and enrolling in professional courses.
 TECHNOLOGY CAREERS
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
You store files in folders, which are containers for related files, 
and on drives, which are storage devices. You use folders to 
organize your files on a drive.
n 
A computer can store folders and files on different types of 
disks, including removable media and hard disks. Before your 
computer can access a removable disk, you must insert the 
disk into a drive, which Windows names by assigning it a 
drive letter.
n 
Windows organizes the folders and files in a computer in a 
hierarchy called a file system. At the top of the file system is 
the root directory, which is where Windows stores system files 
and folders.
n 
The file management tool in Windows 8 is called File Explorer. 
You use File Explorer to display files and folders, navigate the 
Windows file system, and perform other file management tasks.
n 
To navigate a computer with File Explorer, you click expand 
icons in the Navigation pane until you find the folder that you 
want. Then, you click the folder icon in the Navigation pane to 
view the folders and files it contains, which are displayed in 
the right pane. 
n 
A file path is a notation that indicates where a file is stored. A 
file path includes the drive name and letter, folder and subfold-
ers, and the full filename. 
n 
A full filename includes the main part of the filename, a dot, 
and the file extension, which is usually three or four characters 
that identify the file type.
n 
Using File Explorer, you can view the contents of a folder in 
eight ways, including Details view, which lists details about 
each file, and Large icons view, which displays a preview of 
the file’s content if the file includes graphics. 
Summary
n 
To organize files, you group similar files together in a folder, pref-
erably a subfolder in one of the Windows default folders. Separate 
the files into subfolders depending on the purpose or subject mat-
ter of the files, and organize the subfolders from the top down.
n 
After creating folders and subfolders according to your file 
organization, you can copy and move files into the folders 
using several methods. Some methods use the Clipboard, a 
temporary storage area for files and information that you copy 
or move from one place and plan to use somewhere else.
n 
You should delete files and folders you no longer need to stay 
organized. When you delete a file from a hard disk, Windows 
removes the file from the folder but stores the file contents in 
the Recycle Bin until you remove them permanently.
n 
The names of folders and files should reflect their contents, 
and can contain up to 255 characters, except for certain charac-
ters that have special meanings in Windows.
n 
In Windows, a shortcut is a quick way to perform an action 
such as opening a folder or a file. You can create shortcuts on 
the Start screen and on the desktop.
n 
To find a file using File Explorer, you click the Search box and 
then start typing text associated with the file, such as a word 
in the filename.
n 
The three categories of files on a computer are system files, 
application files, and data files. A system file is one necessary 
for running the operating system. An application file is a nec-
essary file for running the application. A data file is one you 
create when working with an application.
n 
You should be able to recognize common file types and their file 
extensions so you know which files to avoid (system and applica-
tion files) and to identify applications you can use to open files.

Mod1-90	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
After using a computer for a short while, most people want to customize parts of 
the user interface to suit their preferences. In this chapter, you explore three tools 
Windows provides for customizing the operating system: the Personalize menu, the 
PC settings screen, and the Control Panel. You start by changing the appearance of 
the Start screen, the desktop, folder icons, and window elements. You’ll also learn 
how to set the date and time and select options to make Windows more accessible to 
all users. To conserve energy, you’ll learn how to change power options and select 
power plans. Finally, you’ll work with user accounts to determine what types of 
tasks users can perform.
Changing the Start Screen Background
One of the first preferences that users set in Windows 8 is the appearance of the Start 
screen. You can do so by changing the background design and selecting different 
background and accent colors. Especially if you use a computer for many hours a 
day, you should set appearance preferences so the interface is appealing to you.
To change the Start screen background, you use the Personalize menu, which 
opens on the right side of the Start screen. As you make selections on the Personalize 
menu, you can observe the changes on the Start screen.
In Step-by-Step 4.1, you change the Start screen background by selecting a 
background design, background color, and accent color. Note your current settings 
so you can restore them at the end of these steps.

Using the PC Settings Screen
Now that you’ve worked a bit with Windows 8, you’ve probably noticed that the 
operating system uses two main interfaces: the one that displays the Start screen 
and Windows 8 apps, and the other that displays the desktop, its windows, and 
­applications. Consequently, you use different tools to customize these interfaces. 
The PC settings screen provides access to nine categories of settings you can adjust 
when using the Start screen and Windows 8 apps. Each of these categories includes 
settings that apply only to the Start screen environment. The other settings are 
system-wide settings that also apply to the desktop. Table 4–1 describes each cat-
egory on the PC settings screen.

Using the Control Panel
Recall that the Control Panel is a window that contains specialized tools you use to 
change the way Windows looks and behaves. All of the Control Panel tools provide 
access to dialog boxes that let you select or change the properties, or characteristics, 
of an object or group of related objects. Most Control Panel tools affect the entire 
system. For example, you can set options to conserve power, which apply to the 
desktop and the Start screen environments. Some tools apply to the desktop only. 
For example, you use the Personalize tool to change the theme, which is a ­desktop 
­background and a set of colors, sounds, and other elements that appear by default in 
the desktop environment only.
Many Control Panel categories are similar to the ones on the PC settings screen. 
For example, both the Control Panel and PC settings screen have an Ease of Access 
category. The options you can set in each category differ, however. If an option 
affects only the Start screen or Windows apps, it appears on the PC settings screen. If 
an option affects only the desktop, it appears in the Control Panel. Some options that 
affect both the Start screen and the Control Panel environments appear in both the 
PC settings screen and the Control Panel.
You worked with the Control Panel in Lesson 2 when you explored Windows 
Update. The Home page of the Control Panel is shown again in Figure 4–5 to illus-
trate the tools available for customizing Windows and the desktop.

Mod1-96	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Personalizing the Desktop Appearance
The easiest way to personalize the desktop in Windows is to select a theme. When 
you do, your selections affect four elements: the desktop background image; the 
­colors for window borders and the taskbar (called a color scheme); the collection 
of sounds that play to signal system tasks, such as shutting down Windows; and 
the screen saver. Some themes are classified as Windows themes, which contain 
high-resolution photographic images. Windows also provides a few high-contrast 
themes, which make the items on your screen easier to see, especially if you have 
impaired vision.
You can select one of the images in a Windows theme to display as the desktop  
background, or you can play a slide show of the images displayed at specified  
intervals. To create a cohesive look, you can select a color scheme and set a screen 
saver, an animated design or image that appears after the computer has been idle for 
a specified amount of time.
In Step-by-Step 4.3, you change the desktop theme using the Control Panel. 
First, you make sure the Control Panel is displayed in Category view to match 
Figure 4–5. You can also display the Control Panel in Large icons view or Small 
icons view, which both list the Control Panel tools in alphabetical order. Large icons 
view shows larger icons for the tools, while Small icons view shows smaller icons but 
more tools to minimize scrolling. In Category view, changing the theme is included 
in the Appearance and Personalization category, which provides tools for custom-
izing the appearance of the desktop. Keep in mind that changing the desktop theme 
does not affect the appearance of the Start screen or Windows 8 apps.

Customizing Desktop and Folder Icons
Besides changing the desktop theme, you can change the appearance of the icons on 
the desktop. By default, only the Recycle Bin icon appears on the desktop. You can 
use the Desktop Icon Settings dialog box to add other icons for tools you use often, 
such as the Control Panel, to the desktop. From this dialog box, you can open the 
Change Icon dialog box to change the appearance of the desktop icons. For example, 
you could change the appearance of the Recycle Bin icon to an image that reminds 
you it contains deleted files. You can also use the Change Icon dialog box to change 
the appearance of a folder icon. For example, you can select an icon that reflects 
the folder’s contents, such as music files. To change a folder icon’s appearance, you 
must select a folder in its physical storage location, not in a library. Changing icons 
can enhance the appeal of your computing environment in general and make the 
icons more meaningful and useful to you.
In Step-by-Step 4.4, you change the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop. The 
Recycle Bin icon has two images: one that appears when the Recycle Bin is in 
an empty state, and another that appears when it is in a full state, meaning there 
are deleted items in it. You’ll change the icon that matches the current state of the 
Recycle Bin on your desktop. You also change the icon for a folder stored on a 
USB drive. Insert the USB drive containing the data files for this book before you 
­perform the following steps.
Above and Beyond
Another way to customize folder 
icons is to show a picture of your 
choice as part of the icon. To do 
so, right-click the folder icon, and 
then click Properties on the short-
cut menu. Click the Customize 
tab in the folder’s Properties dia-
log box, and then click the Choose 
File button. Navigate to a picture 
file stored on your computer, and 
then select it to add the picture to 
the default folder icon.

Working with Regional Settings
The time displayed in the notification area of the taskbar, which is called the ­system 
time, should reflect the time zone for your location. Operating systems use the 
­system time to mark when files and folders are created and modified. In Windows, 
you can change the regional settings and localize your computer, which means it 
uses settings appropriate for a particular location.
In the Time and language category of the PC settings screen and in the Clock, 
Language, and Region category of the Control Panel, you can change time zone 
­settings, the date, your location, and the format Windows uses to display dates and 
times. Some apps, such as Maps and Weather, provide you with local information 
based on the location you select. You can also change the display language, which is 
the language that Windows uses in wizards, dialog boxes, menus, Help and Support 
topics, and other items in the user interface. Windows installs some display languages 
by default; you might need to install additional files for other languages. The Control 
Panel includes a few additional settings, which you identify in Step-by-Step 4.5.
In the following steps, you review the options for selecting a time zone, a lan-
guage, and a region. You start working in the PC settings screen to change the time 
zone. You also use the Control Panel to review the available date, time, and language 
settings. Note your original settings so you can restore them at the end of this Step-
by-Step. Many computer labs do not allow access to these settings. If you are not 
allowed to access them, read but do not perform the following steps.

Setting Accessibility Options
Accessibility refers to features that make a computer easier to use for people who 
might otherwise have trouble viewing the screen, hearing system sounds, or using 
a mouse and keyboard. Devices with touchscreens are easier to use for most people 
because you can interact with them directly by touch, rather than manipulating a 
mouse or other pointing device. Personal operating systems include accessibility 
features that can heighten the contrast between colors on the screen, making objects 
easier to see. Personal and mobile operating systems provide tools that narrate text 
displayed on the screen and provide text or visual alternatives to sound, such as 
captions for speech in videos.
Windows calls its accessibility features Ease of Access options. Although these 
options are designed for users with special vision, hearing, and mobility needs, 
any user might find it helpful to adjust Ease of Access settings when performing 
tasks such as creating illustrations that require more control over mouse and key-
board settings or when working in a poorly lit or noisy room. The Ease of Access 
category on the PC settings screen includes accessibility features that apply to the 
Start screen and apps as well as the desktop, including high contrast and Narrator, 
which reads onscreen text aloud. You use the Ease of Access category in the Control 
Panel to open the Ease of Access Center, which includes all of the accessibility 
features in Windows.
In Step-by-Step 4.6, you explore the Ease of Access category in the PC settings 
screen, and then switch to the desktop to open the Ease of Access Center, which 
includes the following three sections:
n	
Quick access to common tools box—This section provides tools that make your 
computer easier to use: Magnifier, Narrator, On-Screen Keyboard, and High 
Contrast. When you turn on a tool, it stays on until you sign out of Windows or 
shut down.
n	
Get recommendations to make your computer easier to use—Click this link to 
display a questionnaire about how you want to use your computer. When you 
submit the questionnaire, Windows provides a list of settings that can make your 
computer easier to use. You can then select the settings you want.
n	
Explore all settings—This section lists eight categories of accessibility tools, 
such as those that make the computer easier to see or use. When you select a tool 
and set its options, it starts immediately and each time you sign in to Windows.
In the following steps, you explore the options in the Ease of Access category 
of the PC settings screen, and then change the size and color of the mouse pointer 
to make it easier to see. Next, you display the Ease of Access Center on the desk-
top, select the Magnifier in the Quick access to common tools box, and then use 
the Magnifier to enlarge the area of the screen around the pointer. Some Ease of 
Access tools require hardware that can adapt to the changes the tools require. For 
example, to use the Magnifier, your monitor must be able to display magnified parts 
of the screen. If your computer does not have the required hardware, the tool will 
not work.

Customizing Power Options
Computers consume power when you run them and even when they’re idle. You 
should use only the power your computer needs to complete your current task so you 
can conserve energy in general. If you use a mobile computer, such as a laptop, tab-
let, or smartphone, power is a greater concern. Although mobile devices use far less 
electricity than desktop computers, mobile computers get the power they need from 
a battery, and you can draw power from the battery only for a limited time before 
you need to recharge it. For this reason, mobile computers display a battery icon that 
shows how much charge is left in the battery.
According to energy.gov (a Web site provided as a service by the U.S. 
Department of Energy), you can save energy by reducing the power consumption of 
your computer in the following ways:
n 
Monitors use a significant amount of electricity, so you can save energy by turn-
ing off the monitor if you don’t plan to use the computer for 15–20 minutes.
n 
Turn off the CPU by shutting down or using a power-saving feature such as sleep.
n 
Use the power management features in your operating system to select settings 
appropriate for how you use the computer.
You use the power management features in the operating system to change 
the power state of a computer. A power state is a set of conditions that determines 
how much power the computer is using. Common power states range from fully 
awake (­consuming the most power), to sleep or standby, hibernation, and shut down 
(­consuming no power). Windows provides the following power states (Lesson 1 
introduced sleep and shut down):
n	
Sleep—In this power state, Windows saves your data and system settings in tem-
porary memory, blanks the screen, and does not perform any activities, which 
conserves power. When you’re ready to use your computer again, Windows 
quickly wakes up and resumes operations. Because your data is saved in tempo-
rary memory, you could lose it if the power fails completely, so it’s best to save 
your work before letting your computer go to sleep.
n	
Hibernation—Ideal for mobile computers, hibernation saves your work to your 
hard disk, reduces the power for a specified amount of time, and then turns 
off your computer. Windows puts a mobile computer into hibernation when the 
­battery charge is critically low.

n	
Hybrid sleep—As an alternative to sleep designed for desktop computers, Windows 
includes a power state called hybrid sleep, which saves your data on the hard disk 
(not temporary memory) before putting your computer to sleep. Using hybrid 
sleep, your computer quickly resumes running and avoids the risk of losing data.
n 
Shut down—This power state turns off the power completely to save wear and 
tear on your electronic components and conserve energy.
Setting Basic Power Options
To work with the full set of power options in Windows 8, you open the Power 
Options window in the Control Panel. You can use the Power Options window to set 
what Windows does in certain conditions. These basic power options vary depending 
on whether you are using a desktop or a mobile computer. For example, you can set 
a mobile computer to hibernate when you press the power button rather than sleep, 
which is the default. You can set the following basic power options:
n 
Require a password on wakeup—Select this setting if you want to protect your data 
by requiring users to enter a password when the computer wakes up from sleep.
n 
Choose what the power buttons do—Specify what happens when you press the 
hardware power button and your computer is running on battery power or is 
plugged into a power outlet. Options include do nothing, sleep, hibernate, and 
shut down. If your computer has a sleep button, you can also specify whether the 
computer does nothing, goes to sleep, or hibernates when you press that button. 
If your computer does not have a sleep button, this option is called Choose what 
the power button does.
n 
Choose what closing the lid does—Specify what happens when you close the 
lid on a laptop computer and your computer is running on battery power or is 
plugged into a power outlet. (This option is not available for desktop ­computers.) 
Options include do nothing, sleep, hibernate, and shut down.
n 
Create a power plan— A power plan is a collection of hardware and system set-
tings that manages how your computer uses and conserves power. If none of the 
default Windows power plans is right for your needs, select this option to create 
your own power plan.
n 
Choose when to turn off the display—Specify how long to wait before dim-
ming the display and turning off the display when your computer is running 
on ­battery power or is plugged into a power outlet. You can also set the screen 
brightness to use on battery power and when plugged in, if your monitor sup-
ports this feature.
n 
Change when the computer sleeps—Specify how long to wait before letting the 
computer go to sleep when running on battery power or when plugged into a 
power outlet.
Quick Tip
You can also use the Power 
and sleep options in the PC 
and devices category of the PC 
settings screen to set when the 
screen is turned off and when the 
computer goes to sleep.

Selecting Power Plans
You can choose from one of three ­built-in power plans that let you save energy, 
maximize system performance, or balance energy conservation with system perfor-
mance. Some computer manufacturers set up other power plans in addition to or 
as an alternative to the built-in plans. The three built-in plans are called Balanced, 
Power saver, and High performance, and are described in Table 4–3.

For each power plan, you can specify how long the computer can be idle before 
Windows dims the display, turns off the display, and puts the computer to sleep when 
you are using battery power or a wall outlet. Depending on your monitor, you might 
also be able to set the intensity of the screen brightness.
In Step-by-Step 4.7, you use the Power Options tool in the Hardware and Sound 
category of the Control Panel to examine the Windows power plans and display the 
basic and advanced settings for one of the built-in plans.

Understanding User Accounts
In Windows and other operating systems, a user account is a collection of informa-
tion that indicates the files and folders you can access, the types of changes you can 
make to the computer, and your preferred appearance settings (such as your desktop 
theme and Start screen background). If you have a user account on a computer that 
you share with other people, you can maintain your own files and settings separate 
from the other users.
You can create two types of accounts in Windows 8:
n 
Microsoft account—With a Microsoft account, you can access resources on 
your computer and Microsoft cloud computing services, which are services 
stored online, similar to Web applications. With a Microsoft account, you can 
store files and folders on your SkyDrive. The advantage of a Microsoft account 
is that you provide one user name and one password to sign into your computer 
and to connect to your cloud computing services.
n 
Local-only user account—With a local-only user account, you can access only 
resources on your computer.
In addition, a Microsoft account or a local-only user account is a Standard 
account or an Administrator account, which determines how much control the user 
has over the computer:
n 
Standard—A Standard account is designed for everyday computing and can 
protect your computer and data by preventing users from changing settings that 
affect all users. You can access the files and folders in your account, but not the 
files and folders of other users. To make changes such as installing software 
or changing system settings, Windows requests permission or a password for 
an Administrator account. Microsoft recommends that every regular user on a 
computer have a Standard account.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
n 
Administrator—An Administrator account is created when Windows 8 is 
installed and provides full access to the computer. The Administrator account 
can access the files of any user, install and uninstall software, and change any 
settings.
If someone needs temporary access to a computer, the Administrator can turn on 
the Guest account, which is a built-in account that is inactive by default. The Guest 
account user cannot make any changes to settings or software.
When you install Windows 8, the setup program guides you through the steps 
of creating an Administrator account. During that process, you select whether you 
want to use your Microsoft account or a local-only user account as the Administrator 
account. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, you can create one as you install 
Windows. After completing the installation, you can set up a Standard account for 
yourself and one for each person who will use the computer. Any accounts you cre-
ate after the initial Administrator account are Standard accounts by default. Standard 
accounts can be Microsoft or local-only user accounts.
Setting Up a New User Account
When you create an Administrator account or a Standard account in Windows, you 
must provide your user credentials, which consist of at least a username and an 
optional password. A password is a series of letters, numbers, spaces, and sym-
bols that you provide to access your files, applications, and other resources on the 
computer. Windows passwords are case sensitive, so ALincoln212 is different from 
alincoln212. If you have a Microsoft account, you can provide the username and 
password you use for that account. If you don’t have a Microsoft account, you can 
create one as you set up a new Administrator or Standard account. To use a Microsoft 
account, you provide your e-mail address and a password as your user credentials.
If you set up a new Administrator or Standard account as a local-only user 
account, you must provide a username, but the password is optional. However, 
Microsoft strongly recommends that you use a password for all accounts, which 
is one of the most effective ways you can keep your computer and the information 
stored on it secure. When your computer is protected with a password, only someone 
who knows the password can sign in to Windows. Therefore, you should not give 
your password to others or write it in a place where others can see it.
In Step-by-Step 4.8, you create a text document in the Documents folder, and 
then set up a new user account as a Standard, local-user only account. You do so 
using the Users category on the PC settings screen. You must sign in to Windows 
using an Administrator account to add users to the computer. If you are not allowed to 
sign in using an Administrator account, read but do not perform the following steps.

Above and Beyond
For any Windows account with 
a text password, you can also 
set up a personal information 
number (PIN) and a picture 
password. A PIN is a four-digit 
number you can use as a fast way 
to sign in to Windows. Picture 
passwords are designed for users 
of touchscreen devices. On a 
photo on your computer, you 
draw three shapes that Windows 
remembers and requires you to 
repeat to access your account.

Windows signs out of your account and ­displays a screen where you can 
enter your password.
	 2.	 Type the password for the account in the text box that appears 
under the account’s user name, and then press the Enter key. Windows 
takes a few moments to set up the account, and then displays the Start 
screen for the new account. The Start screen settings in the new account 
use the Windows default settings for the background and color scheme.
	 3.	 Click the Desktop tile to display the desktop, and then click the 
File Explorer button 
 on the taskbar to open File Explorer.
	 4.	 Navigate to the Documents folder to display its contents in the right 
pane. The Account Test document you created does not appear in the 
Documents folder because this new user account is a Standard account, 
which means it cannot access files created in another user account.
Rights and Permissions
Microsoft recommends that you use a Standard account for your normal computing 
tasks and the Administrator account only for installing and uninstalling software, 
changing system settings, and any activity that affects other users on the computer. 
It does so because the Administrator account can access settings that change the way 
Windows works. If the person using the Administrator account is careless or mali-
cious, Windows can become corrupted or difficult to use.
One tool that Windows provides for expert users is called the Local Group 
Policy Editor. Group policies are settings that affect how Windows works and 
what rights and permissions user accounts have. In this context, a right is some-
thing a user account is allowed to do. For example, the Administrator account 
has full rights to install software. A permission allows a user account to access a 
file, folder, or other object. In Step-by-Step 4.9, you could not access the Account 
Test document from the newly created Standard user account because that account 
did not have permission to access it. By using group policies, the Administrator 
account can set rights and permissions for other user accounts, especially to 
restrict access to certain locations, such as folders containing ­system files.
If more than one person uses your computer, you can also set permissions so 
you can share files with other users. These sharing permissions determine who can 
change your files and what kinds of changes they can make. In this way, you can 
allow only some users on your computer to view, change, or create files in your 
­folders. You can set two types of permissions: Read permission allows another 
user to only read the files in the shared folder, while Read/Write permission allows 
another user to read, change, add, or delete any file in the shared folder.
In Step-by-Step 4.10, you explore how to share the Documents folder for your 
account with other users. Most likely, you are not allowed to set sharing permissions 
in a computer lab, but you can examine the settings and dialog box you use to do so.

Above and Beyond
On mobile computers used in 
business, the Administrator 
account often sets group 
policies that ensure the power 
­management options are adhered 
to, for example, to conserve  
battery power, and that security 
settings are used, such as requir-
ing a password after sleep, to 
protect the ­computer and its data 
from unauthorized access.

Deleting User Accounts
If an account is no longer being used on a computer, the Administrator account 
can delete it. If you are using an Administrator account, take care before deleting 
other user accounts. Doing so deletes all of the settings and files associated 
with the account. You can use the Accounts category on the PC settings screen 
or the User Accounts and Family Safety category in the Control Panel to delete 
an account.
In Step-by-Step 4.11, you use the PC settings screen to delete the user account 
you created in Step-by-Step 4.8. First, you must sign out of the new account and 
switch to your original one. You must sign in to Windows using an Administrator 
account to delete a user account. If you are not allowed to sign in using an 
Administrator account, read but do not perform the following steps.
Step-by-Step 4.11
	 1.	 Click the Start button 
 to display the Start screen. Click the user icon 
and then click Sign out. Windows signs out of your new account and 
displays the lock screen or the screen where you enter your password.
	 2.	 If necessary, press the Enter key to close the lock screen, click the icon 
for your original account, enter the password for the account, and then 
press the Enter key.
	 3.	 Point to the upper-left corner of the screen, and then click the 
­thumbnail to display the PC settings screen, which should display the 
Other accounts options in the Accounts category.
Quick Tip
You must sign out of your new 
account so you can delete it 
later. Windows cannot delete an 
active account.

Network and System Administrators
Just as you use an Administrator account to manage access to a single computer, a network uses admin-
istrators to manage access to networks. In addition, network or systems administrators are responsible for 
running an organization’s network from day to day. They also install hardware and software and manage 
security so that the network and its computers run smoothly.
Part of a network or system administrator’s responsibilities include managing an organization’s serv-
ers. The administrators customize the server operating system to set up and oversee user accounts and 
work with group policies to set rights and permissions. If you enjoy behind-the-scenes work with operating 
systems and hardware, you might consider a career as a network or systems administrator. Most adminis-
trators work for organizations outside of the technology field, including those in the health care, education, 
finance, and manufacturing industries.
Most organizations require at least a bachelor’s degree in a field related to computer science or 
information technology. Because administrators work with computer hardware and equipment, many 
organizations look for candidates with a degree in computer engineering or electrical engineering. An ideal 
educational program includes classes in computer programming, networking, and systems design.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
The Personalization menu lists options for changing the back-
ground design and the colors used on the Start screen, while 
the PC settings screen includes preferences for using the Start 
screen environment and Windows 8 apps.
n 
Use the Personalization Control Panel tool to customize the 
appearance of the desktop. Most of the other Control Panel 
tools affect the entire system. All of the Control Panel tools 
provide access to dialog boxes that let you select or change the 
properties of an object.
n 
Many Control Panel categories are similar to the ones on the 
PC settings screen. If an option affects only the Start screen 
or Windows apps, it appears on the PC settings screen. If an 
option affects only the desktop, it appears in the Control Panel. 
Some options that affect both the Start screen and the Control 
Panel environments appear in both the PC settings screen and 
the Control Panel.
n 
When you personalize the desktop by selecting a theme, 
you are customizing four elements: the desktop background 
image; the color for window borders and the taskbar; the col-
lection of sounds that play to signal system tasks; and the 
screen saver.
n 
Use the Change Icon dialog box to change the appearance of 
the desktop icons and folder icons.
n 
Use the tools in the Time and language category of the PC set-
tings screen and the Clock, Language, and Region category of 
the Control Panel to localize your computer so it uses settings 
appropriate for a particular location. You can set your location, 
change the date and time, and select the format Windows uses 
to display dates and times.
n 
Accessibility refers to features that make a computer eas-
ier to use for people who might have trouble viewing the 
screen, hearing system sounds, or using a mouse and key-
board. Windows calls its accessibility features Ease of Access 
options, and makes these features available on the PC settings 
screen and in the Control Panel.
n 
Use the power management features in an operating system to 
change the power state of a computer, which is a set of condi-
tions that determines how much power the computer is using. 
Common power states range from fully awake (consuming the 
most power), to sleep or standby, hibernation, and shut down 
(consuming no power).
n 
Windows includes an alternative to sleep called hybrid sleep, 
which saves your data on the hard disk before putting your 
computer to sleep. Standard sleep saves your data in tempo-
rary memory, which is not retained when your computer loses 
power.
n 
You can use the Power Options window to set what Windows 
does in certain conditions, such as having a mobile computer 
hibernate when you press the power button rather than sleep. 
These basic power options are listed in the left pane of the 
Power Options window and vary depending on whether you 
are using a desktop or a mobile computer.
n 
A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings 
that manages how your computer uses and conserves power. 
You can choose from one of three built-in plans that let you 
save energy, maximize system performance, or balance energy 
conservation with system performance.
n 
You can select advanced settings for a particular power plan 
that apply when your computer is running on battery power 
and when your computer is plugged into a power outlet. These 
advanced settings are available in the Power Options dialog 
box, which you open from the Edit Plan Settings window. For 
example, you can specify that you want to use hybrid sleep 
instead of standard sleep.
n 
In Windows and other operating systems, a user account is a 
collection of information that indicates the files and folders 
you can access, the types of changes you can make to the com-
puter, and your preferred appearance settings. If you have a 
user account on a computer that you share with other people, 
you can maintain your own files and settings separate from the 
other users.
n 
In Windows 8, you can set up a local-only user account or a 
Microsoft account, which can access Microsoft cloud com-
puting services such as SkyDrive. In addition, a Microsoft 
account or a local-only user account is a Standard account or 
an Administrator account, which determines how much control 
the user has over the computer.
n 
Only the Administrator account can install and uninstall soft-
ware, change system settings, and perform tasks that affect 
other users on the computer.
n 
When you create an account in Windows, you must provide 
your user credentials, which consist of at least a username 
and an optional password. A password is a series of letters, 
numbers, spaces, and symbols that you provide to access 
your files, applications, and other resources on the computer.
n 
Every user account has certain rights and permissions. A right 
is something a user account is allowed to do. For example, the 
Administrator account has full rights to install software. A per-
mission allows a user account to access a file, folder, or other 
object.
n 
If more than one person uses your computer, you can set 
permissions to share files with other users. These sharing 
permissions determine who can change your files and what 
kinds of changes they can make. In this way, you can allow only 
some users on your computer to view, change, or create files in 
your folders.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
This lesson discusses the computer hardware you need to enter, display, and save 
data. Because the purpose of this hardware is to transfer or store data, you begin by 
learning how a computer represents data. Next, you learn to identify the components 
inside the computer case designed for input and output, and then explore the periph-
eral devices that can connect to these components. Finally, you will compare types 
of devices and media for storing data.
Understanding How a Computer  
Represents Data
Modern computers perform an incredible array of complex tasks, including 
controlling satellites that monitor the weather, rendering 3D special effects in 
blockbuster movies, and putting you in touch instantly with people around the 
world. At their most fundamental level, however, computers are binary machines, 
meaning they understand only two states—on and off, represented by 0 and 1, 
reflecting whether a circuit is receiving electricity (on or 1) or is not receiving 
electricity (off or 0).
Each of these digits is called a bit, short for binary digit, which is the smallest 
unit of data a computer can process. Eight bits grouped together are called a byte, 
which is roughly equivalent to one character.
When you press a key on a computer keyboard, you are actually sending an 
electronic signal to the circuitry in the computer. The circuitry converts the signal 
into binary form and stores it as a byte in memory for processing. For example, if 
you press the lowercase “a” key, the computer stores the binary code 01100001 in 
memory. When the CPU processes that byte of data, it converts it to the letter “a” so 
it can be displayed on a screen in a form users understand. See Figure 5–1.

Naturally, computer users work with much more than a byte of data at a 
time. Terms for measuring data combine “byte” with a meaningful prefix. For 
example, “giga” means “billion,” so the term “gigabyte” means one billion bytes, 
which is equivalent to about 450 digital songs. Table 5–1 lists common terms for 
measuring data.

Identifying System Components for Input 
and Output
As you learned in Lesson 2, the system unit houses a computer’s processing hard-
ware, including the motherboard. In addition to the processor and memory chips, 
components for connecting peripheral devices are attached to the motherboard. See

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Peripheral devices include keyboards, mice, printers, monitors, and other dis-
play screens. To use peripheral devices with your computer, they must be connected 
to the computer in some way, which is the purpose of ports and expansion cards on 
the motherboard.
Ports and Buses
A port is a connecter located on the system case that you use to plug peripheral 
devices into the computer. Inside the system unit, a port is attached to a bus on 
the motherboard. A bus is a sequence of electronic circuitry used to transfer data 
among computer components. For example, the CPU has buses to move data 
between CPU components, such as the control unit and the ALU. Peripheral 
devices use a bus, sometimes called an expansion bus, to exchange data with the 
motherboard. 
A computer has different types of ports to accommodate a variety of device 
plugs. So that the device can communicate with the CPU and other components 
when it is plugged into a computer, each port must be connected to an appropriate 
bus on the motherboard. One of the most common types of buses is the Universal 
Serial Bus (USB), which you can use to connect 127 different devices to a single 
USB port. Personal computers typically have four to eight USB ports on the back, 
front, or side of the system unit. If you run out of ports on a computer, you can attach 
a USB hub to increase the number of ports you can use. A USB hub is a device that 
contains a number of USB ports itself, and plugs into a single USB port on a com-
puter. Figure 5–3 shows a USB port and plug, which are probably familiar to you.

Another type of bus is called FireWire, or IEEE 1394, which was developed 
by Apple as a high-speed method for connecting multimedia devices such as video 
cameras to a computer. Like USB, a single FireWire port can accommodate many 
external devices.
In addition to USB and FireWire ports, you might find the following types of 
ports on computing devices. Some of these ports are identified in Figure 5–4, which 
shows the side and front of a laptop computer.

Standards for connecting display monitors
Above and Beyond
Just as software is continually 
improved and updated, hardware 
for computers is also continually 
improved with the goal of larger 
and faster data transfer. These 
improvements are measured in 
standards. (A standard is a set 
of specifications that define a 
technology.) For USB ports, the 
original USB 1.0 standard was 
fairly slow, transferring about 
12 million bits per second 
(Mbps). USB 2.0 transfers data 
at speeds between 480 Mbps and 
4.8 gigabits per second (Gbps). 
USB 3.0 is a recent and more 
advanced version of USB technol-
ogy, with speeds about 10 times 
faster than USB 2.0. The cur-
rent USB standard provides a 
fast, convenient way to connect 
peripheral devices to a computer. 
The IEEE 1394 bus standard 
supports data transfer rates of 
up to 400 Mbps; IEEE 1394b 
provides speeds up to 3.2 Gbps.

Expansion Cards
Circuit boards called expansion cards or adapter cards can be plugged into expan-
sion slots on the motherboard of a desktop or server computer. As their name sug-
gests, expansion cards expand the capabilities of the computer or let you attach a 
peripheral device to the computer. For example, most desktop computers include 
a sound card to connect a microphone, headphones, and speakers to the computer. 
Most computers also include video cards, sometimes called graphics cards, to attach 
a monitor to the computer. These cards are installed so they provide audio and video 
ports on the outside of the computer case. The motherboard usually provides extra 
expansion slots so you can install expansion cards for new hardware, such as a high-
definition TV tuner that makes it possible to watch television shows on your com-
puter. Figure 5–5 shows an expansion card being installed in a desktop computer.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Instead of expansion cards, a mobile computer uses ExpressCard modules and 
USB adapters, which are smaller than expansion cards (about 3 inches long) and 
are plugged into slots or ports that you can access outside of the system unit. For 
example, you could use an ExpressCard module to connect a laptop to a TV tuner. 
See Figure 5–6.

A USB adapter connects a computer with a USB port to a device that doesn’t 
have a USB plug, such as an older printer. You can also use USB adapters to connect 
wireless devices, including mice and keyboards. In this case, the mouse or keyboard 
doesn’t have a USB plug, but still needs to send data to the computer. The USB 
adapter is plugged into the computer and receives infrared waves from the wireless 
mouse; the adapter converts the waves into signals that move the onscreen pointer.
Because you don’t have to open the system unit to install an ExpressCard module 
or USB adapter, they are much easier to work with than expansion cards. USB adapt-
ers also work with desktop computers, though ExpressCard modules do not. 
Using Input Devices
An input device is a peripheral device you use to enter data and commands into 
the computer. An input device can be as simple as a keyboard or as sophisticated 
as equipment used for voice recognition. The type of input device you use is deter-
mined by the task you need to perform. For example, in your work in earlier lessons, 
you had to type, point, and click to enter data and commands into a computer.

Keyboards
The keyboard is the most common input device for entering text and numbers 
into a computer. Keyboards can be built into the computer, as they are in mobile 
computers, attached using a cable plugged into a USB port, or connected using 
a wireless connection. Figure 5–7 shows a typical keyboard for a desktop com-
puter, which includes special-purpose keys in addition to those for typing text and 
numbers. 
Above and Beyond
The computer keyboard is derived 
from the manual typewriter, 
which arranged the keys in an 
inconvenient QWERTY layout so 
that people would type slowly and 
avoid jamming the keys. QWERTY 
refers to the first six keys in the 
upper-left part of a typewriter. 
Operating systems do provide sim-
plified, more convenient layouts, 
especially for onscreen keyboards. 
For example, all PC operating 
systems let you use a Dvorak key-
board, which arranges the keys for 
speed and efficiency when typing 
in English. The most common 
letters are on the home row, the 
row where your fingers rest, and 
the least common keys are on the 
bottom row, which is the hardest 
to reach. Alternate keyboard lay-
outs such as the Dvorak keyboard 
have been slow to catch on with 
computer users because QWERTY 
keyboards are so widespread, they 
are the type of keyboard most 
users are initially trained to use. 
Media keys 
Function keys
Numeric keypad

Like most keyboards, the one shown in Figure 5–7 arranges keys into groups. 
In the center are the standard alphabetic and numeric keys. Along the top are media 
keys, which you use to control media settings such as speaker volume. Below the 
media keys are function keys, which software uses for special purposes. For exam-
ple, most applications display Help information when you press the F1 key. To the 
right is the numeric keypad, which arranges keys so you can enter numbers quickly. 
In addition, the keyboard has modifier keys, such as the Alt key, which you hold as 
you press other keys to perform a task; navigation keys, which move the insertion 
point on the screen; and toggle keys, which can be on or off. For example, the Caps 
Lock key is a toggle key—you press it to type in all uppercase letters, and then press 
it again to return to lowercase typing.

Mod1-134	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Mobile computers have more limited keyboards that provide only essential keys 
needed for input tasks. This is because the keyboards on mobile computers are built 
into the system unit, and therefore need to be compact. For example, the keyboard 
shown in Figure 5–8 does not include media keys or a numeric keypad. Mobile 
computer users who want these extra keys can attach a desktop computer keyboard 
through a wireless or wired USB connection.
While laptop keyboards are built into the computer, other mobile devices 
use clip-on keyboards or onscreen keyboards, which are also called virtual key-
boards. If the device has a touchscreen, you can touch the screen directly to use 
the onscreen keyboard. Other innovative types of keyboards include the following:
n	
Ergonomic—An ergonomic keyboard is designed to provide comfort and avoid 
stress or fatigue to your hands, wrists, and arms.
n	
Specialized—Some keyboards include specialized keys that represent specific 
items for input such as food orders and are used in fast-food restaurants and 
other workplaces.
n	
Foldable or flexible—An easily transported keyboard primarily used with 
mobile devices, this type of keyboard is soft to the touch and is water resistant.

Pointing Devices
A pointing device is an input device you use to position the pointer on the screen. 
The pointer appears as an arrow, I-beam, or other shape as you work with software. 
You use the pointer to select onscreen objects such as text, graphics, buttons, icons, 
and links. The following sections discuss various pointing devices.
Mice
The mouse is a pointing device that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. You 
move a mouse on a smooth horizontal surface to control the pointer on the screen. 
The bottom of the mouse is flat and contains a mechanism that detects movement. 
Most mice have left and right buttons or touch-sensitive areas with a wheel in the 
middle that you can roll with a fingertip to scroll the screen. Popular types of mice 
include the following and are shown in Figure 5–10:
n	
Optical—An optical mouse uses a laser to detect movement. 
n	
Wireless—A wireless mouse is a battery-powered device that relies on infrared 
waves to communicate with the computer. 
n	
Touch mouse—A touch-sensitive mouse recognizes gestures in addition to standard 
clicks. For example, you can sweep your thumb on the mouse to scroll the screen.

Touchpads
A touchpad (also called a trackpad) is a touch-sensitive surface that can convert the 
motion and position of your fingers to a relative position on screen. Touchpads are 
usually rectangular and include left and right buttons that serve the same function 
as mouse buttons. Most laptop computers include a touchpad so you can use the 
computer without attaching a mouse. Portable media players such as iPods include 
­circular touchpads for selecting songs and other media. Touchpads are also avail-
able as separate devices for desktop computer users. Some touchpads accept the 
same types of motions you make on a touchscreen, such as sliding a finger to drag 
an onscreen object. Figure 5–11 shows a variety of touchpads.

Pointing Sticks
Some mobile computers contain a pointing stick, a pressure-sensitive device that 
resembles a pencil eraser. It is located on the keyboard, generally between the G, H, 
and B keys. See Figure 5–12. You move a pointing stick with your forefinger, while 
using your thumb to press related keys. In a confined space, many people find a 
pointing stick more convenient than a mouse. IBM popularized this device by intro-
ducing the TrackPoint on its ThinkPad notebooks.

Trackballs
A trackball is a pointing device that works like a mouse with a ball on top of the device. 
You use your thumb and fingers to manipulate the ball, which controls the pointer on 
the screen. A trackball is stationary, making it a good alternative to the mouse when 
you have limited workspace. Trackballs are also easier to use if you have limited hand 
or finger mobility. As shown in Figure 5–13, some trackballs are separate devices you 
connect to the computer as you do a mouse; others are built into the keyboard.

Touchscreens
Many mobile computers, especially tablets and smartphones, use touchscreens, 
which have a touch-sensitive surface that overlays the screen display and responds 
to the electrical impulses in your fingertips. In addition, computers provided at 
kiosks in public places, such as an airport, have touchscreens to make it easy for 
users to enter data and select options. See Figure 5–16. Touchscreens are popu-
lar because they let you interact with a computer without using an external input 
device.

Above and Beyond
Touchscreens have been around 
longer than you might think. 
The first screen to use touch 
technology was an air traffic 
display screen, developed by E.A. 
Johnson in 1965. In 1993, IBM 
and telephone company BellSouth 
released Simon, the first prod-
uct to use a touchscreen with 
a phone. Touchscreens became 
commonplace when Apple intro-
duced the iPhone in 2007.
Touchscreens are not technically pointing devices because they allow you 
to interact with a GUI without moving an onscreen pointer. Instead, you move 
your hand to a location on the screen and then tap your finger on an object or 
make a gesture, which involves moving one or more fingers on the touchscreen. 
For example, on many touchscreens, you touch the right side of the screen and 
then swipe your finger to the left to scroll and display information out of view. 
Touchscreens that accept input from more than one finger are called multitouch 
displays.
Digital Pens
Many mobile computers and some desktop computers accept input from a stylus, 
which is a pen-like writing instrument that works with touchscreens. See Figure 5–17. 
You use a stylus for precise touch input by writing, drawing, or tapping on a screen. 
You often use a stylus to provide an electronic signature on a touch-sensitive pad in 
a retail location.

Audio Input Devices
Audio input is sound entered into a computer, and includes speech, sound effects, 
and music. Examples of audio input devices are microphones, portable music 
players, radios, and other hardware such as electronic piano keyboards. Voice or 
speech input is a category of audio input. With the appropriate kind of software, 
you can use voice-recognition devices such as built-in or external microphones to 
speak commands into the computer and to enter text. External microphones are 
typically part of a headset, which includes one or two headphones for audio output 
and a microphone for audio input. See Figure 5–18. Mobile phones and hands-
free navigation systems in motor vehicles use voice-recognition systems, as do 
devices that accept voice commands to control wheelchairs and other objects that 
increase mobility.

Video Input Devices
When you capture still or moving images with a digital camera, they are stored digi-
tally in the camera as video input to the device. The images can also be used as video 
input to a computer. After transferring the images to the computer, you can view 
and edit them with photo-editing or video-editing software. Most tablets and smart-
phones include digital cameras so you can skip the transferring step and take photos 
directly with your mobile device.
A PC video camera or Webcam is a type of digital video (DV) camera you 
can use to send live images over the Internet, participate in video telephone calls, 
and send e-mail messages with video attachments. Most computers include built-in 
Webcams, though they are also available separately.
Besides capturing images, you can use the cameras built into mobile devices to 
conduct video phone calls that allow you and your contact to see each other while 
you speak. See Figure 5–19.

Specialized Input Devices
Other input devices are used for specialized applications. These include game con-
trollers, which you use when playing games, especially those that simulate driving a 
car or flying a plane, and many types of scanners and security devices. The following 
sections describe these input devices.
Game Controllers
The joystick and wheel are types of pointing devices you use when playing games

expert fine-motor skills. A joystick consists of a plastic or metal rod mounted on a 
base. You can move the rod in any direction. Some joysticks have switches or buttons 
that you can manipulate to enter data or select options. A wheel is similar to a steer-
ing wheel; you use it to simulate driving a vehicle. See Figure 5–20. Most wheels 
also include foot pedals for braking and acceleration actions.

Scanners
Scanners are devices that can change images into codes that the computer accepts 
as input. The quality of a scanner is measured by pixels per inch (ppi). The higher 
the ppi number, the better the input image. Scanners are available in various 
sizes and types, including the following. Some of these scanners are shown in

Flat-bed scanners—These devices convert printed documents and images 
into an electronic object that you can store in a computer’s memory. You can 
then manipulate the documents and images. Flat-bed scanners resemble copy 
machines, with a glass surface where you place the material you want to scan. 
Text you scan is stored as a single object, which means you cannot edit it.
n	
Bar code scanners—A bar code is a matrix or series of lines with varying 
widths and heights that represents letters and numbers. Figure 5–21 shows 
the type of scanner that reads bar codes printed on products, such as at a gro-
cery store. Many mobile phones can also scan and read bar codes, especially 
Quick Response (QR) codes, which are configured as squares rather than lines. 
You might scan a QR code in a print ad with your mobile phone to display a 
product’s Web site.
n	
Radio frequency identification (RFID) readers—RFID readers scan the codes 
stored in an RFID tag, a tiny chip with a radio antenna that can be attached 
to almost anything, including products, price tags, and shipping labels. RFID 
readers can scan many tags at once, which is an advantage over bar code 
scanners.
n	
Magnetic scanners—These devices read encoded information on credit cards. 
The magnetic strip on the back of each card contains the user’s encoded account 
number.
n	
Wireless scanners—These scanners use Bluetooth wireless technology to scan 
bar code data, such as from a hospital bracelet, and transmit it to a computer. 
n	
Optical character recognition (OCR) and optical mark recognition (OMR) 
scanners—These devices use a light source to read characters, marks, and codes; 
the data is then converted into a digital format. Banks use OCR technology to 
scan checks. Commonly known as Scantrons, schools and other organizations 
use OMR for testing purposes.

Biometric Devices
Consider the following scenario: You are going on a two-week vacation overseas—
you are packed and ready to go, but you don’t need a wallet or credit cards. You use 
your fingerprint as an input device to pay for all of your expenses. Such technology 
is called biometrics.
Biometrics is a security technique using automated methods of recognizing a 
person based on a physical characteristic. Biometric devices consist of scanning 
hardware and software that converts the scanned physical information into a digital 
format. Additional software compares the scanned information to a collection of 
stored biometric data. For example, if your fingerprint matches a stored image, you 
are authorized to use a computer or complete a transaction. 
Figure 5–22 shows a keyboard with a built-in fingerprint scanner, which you 
can use to identify yourself by swiping a fingertip over the scanner instead of enter-
ing a password, for example.

Ethics of Biometrics
Biometric security devices provide an easy way to protect personal property, but they are controversial 
when used in business and government. For example, law enforcement at all levels of government can 
use facial recognition technology to identify criminals in large public areas, where it can be difficult 
to maintain security. However, facial recognition technology currently has a high rate of error—using 
it means some people could be accused of crimes they did not commit. In addition, biometric meth-
ods work by comparing a physical feature, such as a person’s face, with stored data, such as a high-
resolution image. Privacy advocates want to know how this data is being obtained and how secure it 
is. Could a hacker steal the biometric data and use it to pose as someone else? The ethical question 
is whether the loss of privacy is worth the added security, especially if biometric data is vulnerable to 
fraud or identity theft.

In addition to identifying people based on their fingerprints, biometric technology 
can identify people based on face, handwriting, or voice recognition. Other less com-
mon techniques use the retina (analysis of the capillary vessels located at the back of 
the eye), iris (analysis of the colored ring surrounding the eye’s pupil), hand geometry 
(analysis of the shape of the hand and length of the fingers), or vein (analysis of the 
pattern of veins on the back of the hand and the wrist). See Figure 5–23.
Using Output Devices
As you learned in Lesson 1, output is data processed into a useful format. Examples 
of output are printed text, spoken words, music, pictures, video, and graphics. Output 
devices display information, and include monitors, projectors, printers, and speakers. 
This section discusses the various output devices in more detail.
Display Devices
Desktop computers typically use a monitor as their display device. The screen is part 
of the monitor, which also includes the housing for its electrical components. Mobile 
computers use integrated flat-panel screens usually called display screens. 
The most popular technology for computer monitors is the liquid crystal display 
(LCD) technology, which manipulates light within a layer of liquid crystal cells to 
produce an image. LCD screens are compact and lightweight, display images clearly, 
and use energy efficiently. See Figure 5–24.

LCD screens are illuminated from the back of the screen, which is called back-
lighting. Standard LCD screens use fluorescent backlighting, which is not environ-
mentally friendly. That technology is being replaced by light-emitting diode (LED) 
technology, which creates higher contrasts and consumes less energy than fluores-
cent backlighting.
Screen Resolution and Size
Display screens form images by combining pixels of color. A pixel (short for picture 
element) is the smallest surface area that can contain color on a display device. The 
number of pixels displayed on a screen is called the screen resolution, which deter-
mines the amount of information that can be displayed at one time. Screen resolution 
is expressed as the number of horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels, 
as in 1366  768 screen resolution. At higher resolutions such as 1600  900, your 
screen can display more information, with text and objects smaller and sharper than 
at lower resolutions, such as 1024  768, which display less information using larger 
objects that are not as sharply defined. 
The video card installed in your computer determines the resolutions available 
for your display screen. The video card also determines at what resolution an LCD 
monitor displays the sharpest images and clearest text, which is called its native 
resolution. When you purchase a computer, the display screen is almost always set 
to the native resolution. You can usually change the resolution to a lower setting to 
make the onscreen objects larger, though the text might not be as clear as text dis-
played at the native resolution.
If you shop for a monitor or mobile computer, be aware that display screens are 
measured diagonally from corner to corner. Desktop computer monitors range from 
17 to 30 inches, though larger ones are available for special purposes. Laptop com-
puter screens are usually between 14 and 17 inches, while tablet screens are between 
7 and 10 inches. Most current displays are widescreen, which means they use a 16:9 
or 16:10 aspect ratio similar to widescreen televisions. The aspect ratio is the ratio 
of the width to the height.
To change the screen resolution in Windows, you use the Screen Resolution 
window, which is a Control Panel tool. In Step-by-Step 5.2, you change the screen 
resolution on your computer, and then return to your original resolution.

Projectors
Another type of display device is a projector, also called a data projector, which 
connects to a computer and projects images onto a wall screen or other large, flat 
surface. Projectors can be small, freestanding devices designed for use with mobile 
computers, or large units mounted onto a ceiling. See Figure 5–27. Small computer 
projectors use LCD or digital light processing (DLP) technology, which bounces 
light off microscopic mirrors on a computer chip. Each mirror corresponds to a small 
dot of color on the projected image. DLP projectors produce sharp, bright images 
that are easy to see even in a well-lit room.

Printers
As you know, printers produce a paper copy, or hard copy, of processing results. 
Printer output is called hard copy because it is tangible—you can touch it—and more 
permanent than other forms of computer output. (In contrast, output on a display 
screen is called soft copy because it is temporary.) Printers are classified as nonim-
pact or impact printers. Nonimpact technology is more recent, and produces text and 
graphics without the printer components directly contacting paper. Impact printers 
have pins or other mechanisms that physically strike paper to print text and images. 
Most home and office computer users have nonimpact printers because they print 
faster and more quietly than impact printers and produce higher quality output. 
If you are selecting a printer to purchase, consider the following features:
n	
Speed—Printer speed is measured in pages per minute (ppm). The number of 
pages a printer can print per minute varies for text and for graphics. Graphics 
print more slowly than regular text.
n	
Print quality—Print quality is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The higher the 
dpi, the better the resolution or print quality.

Figure 5–28  Inkjet printer and cartridges
n	
Price—The price includes the original cost of the printer and what it costs for 
the ink or toner, which is a black or colored powdered ink that binds to paper 
when heated. You can purchase a good-quality printer inexpensively for your 
home use, whereas a high-output system for business can cost thousands of 
dollars. 
The most popular types of printers used today are inkjet and laser printers. When 
a printer combines output options such as printing, scanning, copying, and faxing, it 
is called a multifunction printer. 
Inkjet Printers
An inkjet printer is a nonimpact printer that creates text and images by spraying ink 
onto paper. The ink is contained in cartridges, typically one for black ink and oth-
ers for color. The color inks are sometimes included in one cartridge. Inkjet printers 
use CMYK color, which creates many shades of color by combining cyan (blue), 
magenta (pink), yellow, and black. Some high-end inkjet printers use six colors to 
create richer, more varied output. See Figure 5–28.
Each ink cartridge has from fifty to several hundred small holes, or nozzles, and 
the ink is forced through a nozzle to release a dot of color on the paper.
Inkjet printers are the most popular type of printer for home users because they 
are affordable, compact, and produce good-quality color output. Photo printers, 
which can print high-quality photos, use inkjet technology. 
Laser Printers
A laser printer is a nonimpact printer that produces text and images using the same 
technology as copier machines. As a light-sensitive drum revolves in the printer, a 
laser beam etches text and images on the drum as a pattern of electrical charges. The 
printer then coats the drum with toner, which is contained in a cartridge. Using static 
electricity, the toner clings to the areas containing text and images. As the drum con-
tinues to revolve, it heats up and rolls over a sheet of paper to transfer the toner to the 
page. See Figure 5–29.

Laser printers produce high-quality output faster than inkjet printers, but are 
slightly more expensive, even those that produce only black-and-white output. Color 
laser printers cost much more than color inkjet printers. Because of their speed and 
quality, laser printers are popular with business users and anyone else who needs to 
produce a high volume of printed material. 
Specialized Printers
Impact printers, which include the dot matrix and line printer, were the first type of 
printer developed for personal computing. Dot matrix printers transfer ink to the paper 
by striking a ribbon with pins contained in a printhead. The higher the number of pins, 
the better the resolution of the output. The speed of a dot matrix printer is measured in 
characters per second (cps). With the reduction in cost of laser and ink jet printers, dot 
matrix printers are seldom used today. The line printer is a high-speed variation of the 
dot matrix printer used with large computers such as servers.
Several other types of specialty printers are available, including the following:
n	
Thermal—A thermal printer forms characters by heating special heat-sensitive 
paper. Retail stores, including gas stations, often print receipts using thermal 
printers.
n	
Mobile—A mobile printer is a small, battery-powered printer, primarily used to 
print from a mobile computer, including tablets and smartphones. Mobile print-
ers use inkjet or thermal print technology.
n	
Label and postage—A label printer prints labels of various types and sizes on 
paper that contains an adhesive on one side. A postage printer is a special type 
of label printer that contains a built-in digital scale and prints postage stamps.
n	
Plotters and large-format—Engineers, architects, and graphic artists use plot-
ters and large-format printers for drawings and drafting output.

According to Evolve Recycling 
(www.evolverecycling.com), it 
takes about one gallon of oil to 
produce a toner cartridge, and up 
to 450 years for a toner cartridge 
to decompose in a landfill. Every 
year, more than 300 million 
inkjet and toner cartridges are 
buried in landfills, which creates 
150 million pounds of waste. 
To reduce the amount of waste, 
you can recycle inkjet and toner 
cartridges. Recycling companies 
refill and repair the cartridges, 
and then sell them as remanu-
factured products.

Audio Output Devices
Speakers are another type of output device. Speakers, headphones, and ear-
buds generate sound, such as music or speech. Most computers have an internal 
speaker that produces low-quality sound, which is adequate for the beeps, chimes, 
and other sounds software uses to alert you to software events, such as the appear-
ance of a warning dialog box. You can attach speakers to a computer to produce 
high-quality sound, especially if you are playing games or watching movies. See 
Figure 5–30.
You use headphones or earbuds to hear music, voice, and other audio output 
privately. Headphones cover the ear, while earbuds rest inside the ear canal. When 
you plug a pair of headphones or earbuds into the computer, the internal or attached 
speakers are muted automatically.
In Step-by-Step 5.3, you use the Control Panel to open the Device Manager 
window, which lists all of the hardware components in your computer as well as 
the input and output devices attached to it. Besides displaying a comprehensive 
list of your computer hardware, the Device Manager window shows their status 
(working properly or experiencing problems), and helps you troubleshoot hard-
ware problems. For example, if a peripheral device doesn’t work when you attach 
it to your computer, you can use Device Manager to solve the problem in the 
following ways:
n	
Look for yellow or red problem icon—If the device is listed with a yellow warn-
ing icon, that means something is wrong with the device or its settings. You can 
click the icon to learn more about the problem. A red check mark means the 
device is not working at all.
n	
Open the Properties dialog box for the device—Select the device in the Device 
Manager window and then use the Properties tool to open the Properties dia-
log box, which displays many details about a device, including its status, loca-
tion, and driver information. If the device has a problem, the Status area often 
describes it. For example, the status for a device might be “This device cannot 
work properly until you restart your computer.” In this case, you can solve the 
problem by restarting the computer.
n	
Check for an updated driver—Select the device in the Device Manager window 
and then use the Update Driver Software tool or the Properties dialog box to 
check a Web site for an updated driver. If one is available, you can download and 
install the driver, which can solve many hardware problems.

Scan for hardware changes—If the device is not listed in the Device Manager 
window at all, you can use the Scan for Hardware Changes tool to scan your 
system for hardware changes, which usually detects and enables the device.
n	
Disable and enable the device—If Device Manager indicates a problem with 
the device, you can try to solve it by first disabling the device, which means 
that Windows is not using it. Then you can enable the device, which sometimes 
resolves conflicts the device might be having with other hardware. Device 
conflicts can occur when two or more devices are trying to access the same 
resource, such as memory.
In the following steps, you open the Device Manager window to display the 
hardware on your computer, and then you examine the properties for your display

Using Storage Media and Devices
When you enter data using an input device, the data is stored in RAM, which is 
temporary memory. If you want to keep a permanent copy of the data, you must save 
it on some type of storage media. Storage media are the physical materials used 
to store data, such as disks and DVDs. Storage media are contained in a storage 
device, which is the equipment that records and retrieves data from storage media. 
Storage devices include hard drives, CD/DVD drives, and USB flash drives. The 
term storage technology refers to a storage device and the media it uses. Storage 
technologies include magnetic, optical, and solid-state technologies.
Each storage technology has benefits and limitations. You can compare them 
based on the following characteristics:
n 
Capacity—Capacity is the maximum amount of data a media can store, and is 
usually indicated in gigabytes or terabtyes.
n 
Speed—Speed is measured by access time and the data transfer rate. Access 
time is the average number of milliseconds (ms) it takes a computer to 
retrieve data from the storage device. A millisecond is one-thousandth of a 
second. The data transfer rate determines how much data the storage device 
can move per second from the storage media to the computer. Data transfer 
rates are measured in bytes per second (bps), such as 10 Mbps, which is  
10 megabytes per second.

Hard Drives
A hard drive, also called a hard disk drive, is the main storage device in a computer. 
Although the terms are often interchanged, a hard drive is a storage device, and a 
hard disk is a type of storage media. Most hard drives use magnetic storage technol-
ogy to retain data, which involves magnetizing particles on the surface of a disk or 
tape. Hard drives contain a stack of disks, or platters, made of aluminum or glass 
that are coated with magnetic iron oxide particles and sealed permanently in the hard 
drive case. As a platter rotates in the drive, a read/write head retrieves or stores data 
in concentric rings called tracks. This arrangement allows the mounting shaft in the 
hard drive to spin a platter to a storage location so the read/write head can save or 
retrieve data quickly, a method called direct-access storage. See Figure 5–34. In 
contrast, magnetic tape is sequential—it must fast forward or rewind to allow access 
to a specific storage location.
◗  Vocabulary
hard drive
direct-access storage
The read/write heads in a hard drive use magnetic charges to retrieve and store 
data, not direct contact. If the read/write heads do touch the surface of a platter, they 
can damage data, a condition called a head crash. Although sealed hard drives are 
rugged, jarring a desktop computer while the hard drive is spinning or somehow 
allowing dust into the hard drive case can cause a head crash. Because a hard drive 
contains moving parts—mechanisms to make the platters rotate and the read/write 
head move—it is also considered a mechanical storage device.
Of all types of computer storage devices, hard drives are the most popular for 
storing data because of their speed, capacity, and cost. Access times range from 
6–11 ms, whereas a CD takes up to 500 ms to retrieve data. Computer ads often 
note the hard drive speed as revolutions per minute (rpm), which refers to how fast 
the platters spin when the read/write head is accessing data. The higher the rpm, 
the faster the read/write heads can locate specific data. Ads always mention the 
storage capacity of a hard drive as this factor directly affects the computer’s price. 
Hard drives typically range from hundreds of gigabytes to a few terabtyes of storage 
capacity. Current hard drives store data for pennies per gigabyte.

Solid-State Drives
A recently developed type of hard drive is called the solid-state drive (SSD), which 
uses flash memory technology to store data as electrical rather than magnetic charges. 
The advantage that SSDs offer is that they have no moving parts, so they are more 
durable and reliable than mechanical hard drives. Though they are also more expen-
sive, they consume less power, generate less heat, and retrieve data more quickly, 
making them a good alternative for tablets and other mobile devices. Figure 5–35  
compares a mechanical hard drive and an SSD, both with their cases removed.

External Hard Drives
To increase the storage capacity of your computer, you can use an external hard 
drive, a separate, freestanding high-capacity storage device that you attach to a com-
puter, usually using a USB port. Physical sizes and storage capacities vary, ranging 
from small portable devices designed to hold songs, photos, and other personal 
files, to larger desktop units designed to store copies of an entire computer system. 
External hard drives can use magnetic or solid-state technology. Figure 5–36 shows 
two external hard drives, a small one attached to a laptop, and a larger desktop unit 
standing on its own.

Portable Drives
In addition to external hard drives, you can attach other types of drives to a computer 
and use them to store data. These removable drives are ideal for transporting data 
from one computer to another, adding storage capacity to a computer, and secur-
ing data away from a computer. Removable drives use the same solid-state technol-
ogy as internal SSDs do. The smallest types are collectively called memory cards, 
which are frequently used with cameras, smartphones, portable media players, and 
other similar electronics. Figure 5–37 shows three types of memory cards, includ-
ing a microSD card, which you insert into an adapter and then plug into a USB port 
or memory card slot. You insert larger memory cards into a slot on a computer or 
mobile device, which usually accepts more than one type of memory card.
Popular USB flash drives are another type of solid-state storage media. This 
small removable data storage device uses a USB connector to plug into your comput-
er’s USB port or other electronic device. USB flash drives are also known as thumb 
drives, jump drives, flash drives, and USB sticks.
Storage capacities of solid-state removable drives vary from a few to many giga-
bytes, which is usually enough to transfer documents, photos, music, and video files.
If you use a USB flash drive with your computer, you should not remove it 
while the drive is in use. Disconnecting a USB flash drive while it is storing data 
can damage the files on the device. Windows and other operating systems provide an 
option to safely remove or eject removable storage devices. In Step-by-Step 5.4, you 
attach a USB flash drive to your computer, if necessary, and then safely remove it.

An alternative to storing data 
on your computer or removable 
media is to use cloud storage, 
an Internet service that provides 
storage space on a server. The 
advantage of cloud storage is that 
you can access the data from any 
computer that has an Internet 
connection. Cloud storage sites 
such as SkyDrive, Dropbox, 
Google Drive, and iCloud often 
allow you to store a certain 
amount of data for no charge.  
If you want to store more than 
the limit, you can subscribe to 
the service for an annual fee.

Optical Storage Devices
Optical storage devices use lasers to read and write data on plastic platters that con-
tain a metal layer, which reflects the laser light back to a sensor in an optical drive. 
Desktop and laptop computers often have optical drives. See Figure 5–39.

Optical media such as compact discs (CDs) and DVDs are called discs. The 
technology for storing data on CDs and DVDs is similar, though DVDs have much 
higher storage capacities. CDs were popularized as media for sound recordings, 
whereas DVDs are often used for software, video games, and movies. A more recent 
type of optical storage media is the Blu-ray disc (BD), which provides more than five 
times the storage capacity of a traditional DVD. 
CDs, DVDs, and BDs are available in read-only memory (ROM), record-
able (R), and rewritable (RW) formats. For example, a rewritable CD is noted as a 
CD-RW. In addition, CDs are produced in a digital audio (DA) format, also known 
as audio CDs, which is used for music publishing and distribution. You can only use 
optical discs in the RW format to store (or write) data multiple times. After informa-
tion is written on an audio CD or any optical disc in the ROM or R format, it cannot 
be changed.

Table 5–2 shows the storage capacities of different types of optical discs. DVDs 
that can store data on one side only are called single-sided DVDs, whereas those that 
store data on both sides are called double-sided DVDs. Instead of using sides, Blu-
ray discs use one or two layers of media on a single side of the disc.

Blu-ray disc drives use a blue-
violet laser to read and write 
data, unlike earlier optical disc 
drives such as those for DVDs, 
which use a red laser. The blue 
laser makes it possible for the 
disc to store data at a greater 
density than a red laser, which 
is why Blu-ray discs have higher 
storage capacities though they 
are the same size as CDs and 
DVDs. Although they use different 
lasers, Blu-ray disc drives can 
generally read standard CDs  
and DVDs.
Optical discs are more durable and less susceptible to damage than magnetic stor-
age media. However, although optical drives are fast enough to play movies, videos, 
and other data-intensive content, they are not fast enough to access data the way that 
hard drives do. Most optical drives can read and write data to both CDs and DVDs.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Computers are binary machines, which means they under-
stand two states: off (0) and on (1). The digits 0 and 1 are each 
called a bit. Eight bits grouped together make a byte. Data-
measurement terms add a prefix to byte to indicate amounts. 
For example, “giga” means one billion, so a gigabyte is a 
billion bytes.
n 
To use peripheral devices with your computer, they must be 
connected to the computer in some way, which is the purpose 
of ports and expansion cards on the motherboard.
n 
A port is a connecter located on the system case that you use 
to plug peripheral devices into the computer. Inside the sys-
tem unit, a port is attached to a bus, a sequence of electronic 
circuitry on the motherboard used to transfer data among com-
puter components. 
n 
Expansion cards can be plugged into expansion slots on the 
motherboard of a desktop or server computer. These cards 
expand the capabilities of the computer or let you attach a 
peripheral device. For the same purpose, mobile computers use 
ExpressCard modules and USB adapters, which are smaller 
than expansion cards and are plugged into slots or ports that 
you can access outside of the system unit. 
n 
An input device is a peripheral device you use to enter data and 
commands into the computer. Typical input devices include 
keyboards, mice and other pointing devices, touchscreens, and 
microphones.
n 
The keyboard is the most common input device for entering 
text and numbers into a computer. Keyboards can be built into 
the computer, as they are in mobile computers, attached using 
a cable plugged into a USB port, or connected using a wire-
less connection. In addition, computers can use onscreen key-
boards as input devices.
n 
The mouse is the most common type of pointing device, which 
is an input device you use to position the pointer on the screen. 
Popular types of mice include optical, wireless, and touch mice.
n 
Other types of pointing devices include touchpads, pointing 
sticks, and trackballs.
n 
Touchscreens have a touch-sensitive surface that overlays the 
screen display and responds to the electrical impulses in your 
fingertips. Touchscreens are popular because they let you inter-
act with a computer without using an external input device.
n 
Many computers with touchscreens accept input from a stylus, 
which is a pen-like writing instrument. Other types of digital 
pens capture data as you write or draw on any surface.
n 
Audio input is speech, sound effects, and music entered into a 
computer. Audio input devices include microphones, portable 
music players, radios, and other hardware such as electronic 
piano keyboards.
n 
You use video input devices to enter still and moving images 
into a computer, often through a camera built into the computer.

n 
Specialized input devices include game controllers, scanners, 
and biometric security devices.
n 
Output is data processed into a useful format, such as printed 
text, spoken words, music, pictures, video, and graphics. Output 
devices include monitors, projectors, printers, and speakers.
n 
Desktop computers typically use a monitor as their display 
device. Mobile computers use integrated flat-panel screens 
usually called display screens. 
n 
The amount of information a screen can display at one time is 
determined by its screen resolution, which is expressed as the 
number of horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels, 
as in 1366 3 768 screen resolution. The video card installed 
in your computer determines the resolutions available for your 
display screen.
n 
Display screens are measured diagonally from corner to cor-
ner. Size ranges include 17 to 30 inches for desktop computer 
monitors, 14 to 17 inches for laptop computer screens, and 7 to 
10 inches for tablets.
n 
A projector, also called a data projector, is an output device 
that connects to a computer and projects images onto a wall 
screen or other large, flat surface.
n 
Printers produce a paper copy, or hard copy, of processing 
results, and are classified as nonimpact or impact printers. 
Most home and office computer users have nonimpact printers 
because they print faster and more quietly than impact printers 
and produce higher quality output.
n 
The two most popular types of printers are inkjet and laser 
printers, both types of nonimpact printers. An inkjet printer 
creates text and images by spraying ink onto paper. A laser 
printer produces text and images using the same technology as 
copier machines.
n 
Impact printers, which include the dot matrix and line printer, 
were the first type of printer developed for personal comput-
ing. Other types include thermal, mobile, label and postage, 
and plotters and large-format printers.
n 
Speakers, headphones, and earbuds are output devices that 
generate sound, such as music or speech. 
n 
If you want to keep a permanent copy of the data you enter as 
input, you must save it on a storage medium, such as a disk 
or DVD. 
n 
Storage media are contained in a storage device, which is the 
equipment that records and retrieves data from the storage 
medium. Storage devices include hard drives, CD/DVD drives, 
and USB flash drives.
n 
Storage technology refers to a storage device and the media 
it uses. Storage technologies include magnetic, optical, and 
solid-state technologies.
n 
Hard drives are the main storage devices in a computer. Most 
use magnetic storage technology to retain data. Because hard 
drives consist of platters that rotate as a read/write head moves 
to save or retrieve data, they are also considered mechanical 
storage devices.
n 
Solid-state drives use flash memory technology to store data as 
electrical rather than magnetic charges. Though they are more 
expensive, they offer advantages over hard drives because they 
have no moving parts, consume less power, generate less heat, 
and retrieve data more quickly. 
n 
An external hard drive is a separate, freestanding high-capacity 
device that you attach to a computer, usually using a USB port.
n 
Removable drives such as memory cards and USB flash drives 
are ideal for transporting data from one computer to another, 
adding storage capacity to a computer, and securing data away 
from a computer.
n 
Optical storage devices use lasers to read and write data on 
plastic platters that contain a metal layer, which reflects the 
laser light back to a sensor in an optical drive. Optical media 
such as CDs and DVDs are called discs.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
At some point, you will likely find yourself in the market for a new computer. What 
type of computer should you buy? What features are the most important? Which 
performance measures matter the most? This lesson helps to answer those ­questions. 
It begins by surveying types of personal computers, which is the type you are most 
likely to buy. It also compares tablets and laptops in depth, and explains how to 
­evaluate smartphones. It also discusses embedded computers, and explains the 
difference among servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
Preparing to Purchase a Computer
Although thousands of models of computers are available today, they can all be 
organized into three categories: personal computers, embedded computers that 
are built into other machines (such as an ATM), and large computers such as 
­servers. Unless you are building a network for a company or performing intensive 
physics calculations, you will be considering a personal computer for purchase. 
A ­personal computer (PC) is a computing device that can perform input, process-
ing, output, and storage activities on its own and is designed to be used by one 
person at a time.
The personal computer you decide to buy depends on how you plan to use it, 
your budget, and its value, which is the quality of the computer’s features, construc-
tion, and components compared to the price. Computer usage is one of the most 
important factors in a decision to purchase a computer, and typically falls into the 
following ranges:
n 
Basic—You plan to use the computer occasionally to perform tasks such as vis-
iting Web sites, exchanging e-mail, and creating word-processing documents.
n 
Intermediate—You plan to use the computer frequently to perform a ­variety 
of tasks, including playing games, watching videos, shopping online, and 
using productivity software for word processing, financial tracking, personal 
information management, graphic design, and other work-oriented or creative 
endeavors.
n 
Advanced—You plan to use the computer to perform tasks that require the 
maximum (or near maximum) amounts available in processing speed, mem-
ory usage, or storage capacity, such as playing graphics-intensive games that 
demand a lot of processing power, watching high-definition movies online, or 
producing many large files, such as those containing photos or videos.
The quality of a computer is determined primarily by the performance of its 
system components. As you shop for computers online or in a retail store, com-
pare the system component features described in Table 6–1. These components are 
most often noted in computer ads and in-store labeling of the computer products. 
Processors and RAM are discussed in detail in Lesson 2. Storage devices are dis-
cussed in Lesson 5. Recall that the processor and RAM affect computer performance 
the most, with the processor determining how fast a computer can work and RAM 
determining how efficiently the computer can provide data to the processor.

When considering a personal computer to purchase, you can select from four 
major types. In largest to smallest order, these are desktop computers, laptops, 
­tablets, and smartphones, and they are discussed in detail in the following sections.

Desktop Computers
A desktop computer is a computer that fits on or next to a desk, is designed to be sta-
tionary, and runs on power from a wall outlet. With a traditional desktop computer, 
the system unit, monitor, keyboard, and pointing devices are separate pieces of hard-
ware. The system unit containing the processing components is called a tower, which 
usually stands vertically on the floor. Some cases are designed to sit horizontally on 
a desktop, under the monitor. See Figure 6–1.

The traditional desktop computer has been popular in offices, schools, and 
homes because it is economical and durable. A typical price for a basic desktop com-
puter adequate for basic computing tasks is around $400. As you increase processing 
power, RAM, and hard drive capacity, the price also increases to as much as $1,200.
A recently developed type of desktop computer is called an all-in-one ­desktop, 
which houses the processing components in the same case that holds the monitor; 
there is no tower. As shown in Figure 6–2, the Apple iMac is an all-in-one desktop.

Because they take up less space than a traditional desktop computer, all-
in-one desktops are a good choice for home computers. They also start around 
$400, and will increase in price with increased processing and storage capacity 
or advanced peripherals. For example, an all-in-one desktop with a touchscreen 
is around $600.
Computer enthusiasts who plan to expand or upgrade their systems often choose 
traditional desktop computers rather than all-in-one desktops. It is easier to remove 
part of a tower’s system case to get inside and install additional RAM, swap an older 
video card for a new one, or set up an extra hard drive than it is to upgrade an all-
in-one desktop. In fact, all-in-one desktops typically have little room for hardware 
expansion.
Traditional desktop computers can also perform more quickly and reliably than 
all-in-one desktops. Because all-in-one desktops have a limited amount of space for 
system components, they must use components that are small and generate little 
heat, which are usually less powerful than traditional desktop components.
On the other hand, all-in-one desktops are more compact than traditional desk-
top computers, can be moved more easily, often include touchscreens, and have a 
sleek, attractive style.
In summary, if you are looking for a powerful, inexpensive desktop computer 
you can upgrade easily, consider a traditional desktop computer. If you are willing 
to pay slightly more for style and compactness, and plan to do average types of 
­computing tasks, consider an all-in-one computer.
Laptop Computers
A laptop computer (sometimes called a notebook) is a lightweight mobile ­computer 
about the size of a paper notebook that includes the system components, keyboard, 
pointing device, and display screen in a single unit. Laptops use a battery as a 
power source, though you can also plug them into a wall output to recharge the 
battery and to power the computer. Many personal computer users prefer laptops 
to desktop computers because laptops are easy to carry and move, use less energy, 
and can fit almost anywhere, including on a user’s lap. In addition, you can use lap-
tops without cables for power or peripheral devices, which reduces clutter. Laptops 
are ­especially popular with students and mobile workers such as salespeople who 
can take their computers with them to classes, the library, meetings, and other 
out-of-office activities. See Figure 6–3.

Most computer historians con-
sider the Osborne 1 to be the 
first truly portable computer. 
Developed by Adam Osborne and 
released in 1981, the Osborne 1 
weighed 24 pounds, cost around 
$1800, and was about the size 
of a sewing machine with a 
5-inch screen. The term “laptop” 
was not applied to computers 
until a few years later, when 
manufacturers designed and 
released smaller machines that 
opened like a clamshell to reveal 
larger screens with resolutions 
similar to desktop computers 
of the time. By the mid-1990s, 
­laptops were common in work-
places and homes.
Above and Beyond
According to Gartner Research, 
sales of standard laptop com-
puters more than quadrupled 
from 2003 to 2013, indicating 
their popularity, while sales of 
desktop computers declined by 
almost 50 percent. However, 
sales of netbook computers also 
decreased while sales of tablet 
computers increased, which 
seems to indicate a general trend 
toward tablet computers.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Comparing Tablets and Laptops
For many people considering a new computer, the choice is between a tablet 
and a laptop. Both are mobile computers developed by a number of computer 
manufacturers, making it likely that you can find one with a combination of features 
and price that suits your needs. To compare tablets and laptops in general, consider 
their input devices, battery life, storage capacity, performance, physical factors, and 
price as well as your computer usage:
n 
Input devices—A laptop provides a physical keyboard and pointing device, 
whereas a tablet using a slate design has a virtual keyboard and touchscreen. See 
Figure 6–5. Many people find virtual keyboards that are controlled by touch less 
responsive than physical ones and more awkward to use for extended ­typing. On 
the other hand, touchscreens are a natural interface, especially for new users and 
for tasks that don’t involve typing or working with small, detailed objects.
Today’s laptops have as much computing power and perform as well as most 
desktop computers because laptops can include top-notch processors and large 
amounts of RAM and hard disk storage capacity. As with desktop computers, prices 
for laptops start around $400 and increase as you add processing power, memory, 
and storage space. However, because it costs more to produce components that fit a 
laptop’s compact design, laptops are slightly more expensive than desktop comput-
ers with the same power, speed, and storage capacity.
Netbook computers (also called ultrabooks) look like laptops but are smaller 
(about 11  8.5 inches rather than 15  10 inches) and lighter (about 3 pounds 
rather than 5 pounds). Netbook computers have less power and storage capacity, lack 
a CD/DVD drive, and provide a smaller keyboard and display screen than laptops, 
but include batteries that hold a charge longer. Netbooks are suitable for mobile 
users who access the Internet frequently or for long periods and don’t need to store a 
lot of data or software on a hard drive.
If mobility is important to you and you use a computer to perform basic to 
advanced productivity tasks (those where you produce a report or presentation, for 
example), you should choose a standard laptop as your computing device.
Tablet Computers
Recall that a tablet computer is a one-piece handheld computer that typically includes 
a touchscreen. Like laptops, tablets run on battery power and can be plugged into a 
wall outlet as necessary. True tablets use a slate design; they are rigid and do not 
fold. Convertible tablets use a hybrid design that includes a swivel screen or remov-
able keyboard so you can use the computer as a laptop or tablet. See Figure 6–4.

Mod1-171 
n 
Battery life—You can be on the move with a mobile computer only as long 
as your battery holds out. Because tablet hardware requires less power than 
laptops, tablets can run on battery power much longer than laptops can. For 
example, the average tablet can run at least 8 hours on battery power, while the 
average laptop can run only for 3–4 hours.
n 
Storage capacity—Tablets use solid-state drives to store data, with capacities of 
16 to 64 GB. In addition, some tablets include slots for microSD cards that can 
hold up to 64 GB of data. Most laptops have mechanical hard drives that can store 
hundreds of gigabytes, with some laptops providing 1 TB of storage. Overall, 
although tablet storage devices can access data quickly and require less power 
than laptops, they offer limited storage capacities.
n 
Performance—Most tablets use low-power dual-core processors, so their per-
formance lags behind that of a laptop, which can use quad-core processors. In 
addition, tablets typically have 1–2 GB of RAM, whereas laptops often have 
much more. If you use a computer only for basic tasks, however, you are not 
likely to notice a difference in performance between a laptop and a tablet.
n 
Physical factors—If you plan to carry the computer for a long time or over 
great distances, size and weight are important factors. Tablets are smaller than 
­laptops, ranging from about 7 to 10 inches diagonally. They also weigh less, 
around 1 pound on average, while laptops range from 2 to 5 pounds. Keep in 
mind that tablets are smaller and lighter than laptops because they have less 
hardware, such as no CD/DVD drive or physical keyboard, which might affect 
how you use the computer.
n 
Price—As a relatively new technology, entry-level tablet computers are more 
expensive (about $500) than entry-level laptops. Considering that the processor 
and main storage device are two of the most expensive components in a com-
puter, a laptop computer is the best value, since it provides better components at 
a lower price.
n 
Computer usage—Computer usage is probably the deciding factor for most peo-
ple choosing between a tablet and a laptop. Because of their physical keyboards, 
storage capacities, and processors, laptops are well-suited to productivity tasks. 
Because of their size, weight, and battery life, tablets are ideal for consumption 
tasks, such as watching videos, visiting Web sites, checking e-mail, and playing 
games, especially on the go.

Smartphones
Recall that a smartphone is a cell phone that includes many features of a computer, 
allowing it to run general-purpose computing applications. Smartphones connect 
wirelessly to the Internet; include built-in cameras, music players, and global 
­positioning systems (GPSs); and let you send and receive phone calls, e-mail 
messages, and text messages.
Many smartphones have touchscreens, though some include a small keyboard 
below the display screen or one that slides out from behind the display screen. See 
Figure 6–6.
The main advantage smartphones offer over other mobile computing devices is 
communication. As a type of cell phone, the smartphone was originally designed for 
making and receiving voice calls. Tools and features on a smartphone support phone 
calls. For example, smartphones include a small microphone and speaker for voice 
calls and a camera for video calls.
Evaluating Smartphones
To evaluate smartphones, you can use the same set of criteria you used to compare 
laptops and tablets—input devices, battery life, storage capacity, performance, phys-
ical factors, price, and computer usage:
n 
Input devices—The physical keyboards provided with some smartphones are 
small, designed for typing short phrases used in Internet search text and elec-
tronic messages. Touchscreens are more common and easier to use.
n 
Battery life—Battery usage on smartphones varies significantly depending on your 
activities. Accessing the Internet, for example, uses more battery power than having 
a phone conversation. When you’re evaluating smartphones, look for information 
about the call time or talk time battery capacity, which ranges from 7 to 17 hours 
in current smartphones; Internet use battery capacity, which ranges from about 4 to 
almost 7 hours; and charging time, which ranges from around 2 to 4 hours.
n 
Storage capacity—Similar to tablets, smartphones use solid-state drives to store 
data, with capacities of 16–64 GB. In addition, smartphones from some manu-
facturers such as Samsung and BlackBerry include slots for microSD cards that 
can hold up to 64 GB of data.
n 
Performance—Smartphones pack a lot of processing power into small space, 
with most models boasting multicore processors and 2 GB of RAM that can 
handle most smartphone tasks with efficiency. These performance features let 
you multitask as much as the operating system allows. On many smartphones, 
for example, you can use a mapping application to display directions to a restau-
rant as you call to make a dinner reservation.

Mod1-173 
n 
Physical factors—Smartphones are designed to be carried for long periods, so 
they are lightweight, about 4–6 oz. Their screens are much smaller than tablet 
screens, usually around 5 inches measured diagonally, though some approach 
7  inches. To compensate for small screens, smartphones increase the screen 
resolution, which is measured in pixels per inch (ppi). Resolutions higher than 
300 ppi produce sharp, crisp images and easy-to-read text.
n 
Price—Prices for smartphones have been falling recently, with an average price 
of around $300 expected in 2017, according to technology market-research firm 
International Data Corp. Because most Americans now own smartphones (56% 
overall, and 80% of people ages 18–24, according to a recent Pew Research 
Center report), smartphone manufacturers must compete on price as well as 
other factors to win new customers and retain current ones.
n 
Computer usage—If you use a computer only to access the Internet and com-
municate with others, a smartphone might be the only computing device you 
need. Software for smartphones is limited by screen size and RAM, and includes 
accessory applications such as a calendar and contact manager. If you need to 
use more productive or full-featured software, purchase a smartphone as a sup-
plement to another personal computer.
Other Mobile Devices
Mobile devices besides laptops, tablets, and smartphones include electronic book 
(e-book) readers, portable media players, and handheld game devices. See Figure 6–7.

Many of these mobile devices provide wireless connections to the Internet, but 
do not include other features or capabilities that mobile computers have. For exam-
ple, you cannot install productivity applications or other software on a handheld 
game device. Instead, each of these devices is dedicated to a particular purpose, and 
only lets you perform tasks related to that purpose. Features of these other mobile 
devices include the following:
n 
E-book readers—You use an e-book reader (also called an e-reader) to down-
load and read electronic versions of printed books, magazines, and newspapers. 
Most e-book readers have touchscreens, though some have buttons and a small 
touchpad you use to navigate digital media. E-book readers are usually smaller 
than a tablet, but larger than a smartphone, and include a hard drive with up 
to 4 GB of storage. Another notable difference is that instead of using LCD 
screens, e-book readers use electronic paper displays, which consume less 
power and provide higher contrast in bright lighting than LCDs. Many e-book 
readers also offer backlights to improve readability when the light is low.

n 
Portable media players—A portable media player is a mobile device that can 
store digital media such as songs, videos, and photos, typically on a small hard 
drive. Portable media players are also called MP3 players, a term that refers to 
the MP3 file format used for many digital audio files. However, some portable 
media players, such as the iPod, also play audio files in other formats.
 
Most portable media players are smaller than a smartphone, though one, the 
iPod Touch, is the same size as the iPhone. Many portable media players 
include wireless connections to the Internet so you can download audio, video, 
and other files easily; otherwise, you transfer digital media from a computer to 
the device, which includes a hard drive or flash drive for storage (typically up 
to 64 GB).
n 
Handheld game device—A handheld game device is a mobile device designed 
for a single video game player to use at one time. Many handheld game devices 
can connect to the Internet and to other game devices so that the user can play 
against others who are using their game device at the same time. About the size 
of a smartphone, these devices include built-in screens, speakers, batteries, and 
controls in one unit. The screens are smaller than those on a smartphone to pro-
vide room for the game controls. Recent models provide touchscreens and up to 
16 GB of data storage.
To prepare for purchasing a personal computer and to learn about the capabili-
ties of computing devices available today, your best resource is the Internet. In Step-
by-Step 6.1, you use a Web browser to visit the Apple Web site, and then review 
the desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices that 
Apple offers. You also compare the features and specifications of each device. If you 
were reviewing these computers for purchase, you would need to consider your com-
puter usage and budget to determine whether any of the devices were right for you. 
As you perform the steps, keep in mind that Web pages change frequently, so the 
images and information you see on the Apple Web site might differ from the figures 
shown in this Step-by-Step.

Understanding Embedded Computers
An embedded computer is a processor built into a household appliance or other 
device such as an ATM, navigation system, refrigerator, television, or other con-
sumer electronics. The appeal and strength of an embedded computer are that it 
adds computing power to a device without needing intervention from a user. For 
example, a washing machine with an embedded computer can use power and water 
more efficiently than one without an embedded computer. Cars use many embedded 
computers. Features such as sensing when your car moves out of its lane or when a 
person or object is blocking your path as you back up are controlled by embedded 
computers. See Figure 6–14.

Recall from Lesson 1 that embedded computers have embedded operating sys-
tems. In some cases, such as a cell phone, the embedded operating system evolved 
into a mobile operating system as developers added features that allowed the oper-
ating system to perform more tasks. In a similar way, embedded computers have 
evolved into mobile computing devices. For example, early portable media play-
ers used embedded computers to manage songs. They accepted input from users 
regarding which songs to play and in what order. The embedded computer stored 
the selections in memory. When a song finished playing, the embedded computer 
sent a signal to play the next song in the playlist and displayed the name and length 
of the song. As developers added features to portable media players that allow users 
to perform multipurpose tasks such as connecting to the Internet and capturing and 
playing videos, they became mobile computing devices.
Understanding Servers and Other Large 
Computers
Although you would not buy a server for personal use, you should know about their 
capabilities because they play a role in everyday life, allowing you to access the 
Internet, exchange e-mail, and download and store files, for example. See Figure 6–15.
Above and Beyond
A video game console is an elec-
tronic device about the size of a 
dictionary that you attach to a TV 
or monitor to play games. Xbox 
and PlayStation are examples 
of video game consoles, which 
contain embedded computers 
and are dedicated to running 
game software. Video game 
consoles are larger versions of 
handheld game devices and eas-
ily allow more than one person to 
play at the same time. Although 
many video game consoles have 
midrange CPUs, can connect 
to the Internet, and use optical 
media such as DVDs, they are 
not a substitute for a personal 
computer, which you can use to 
perform a wide range of tasks.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
You indirectly encounter other types of large computers, including mainframes 
and supercomputers, in your daily life. For example, people who work for banks use 
mainframe computers to process financial transactions, including those for credit 
card purchases you make at stores and online. To bring you up-to-date weather fore-
casts, meteorologists access information provided by supercomputers.
Servers, mainframes, and supercomputers are large computers because they are 
designed for use by more than one person, up to tens of thousands of people in 
many cases. To support that many users, large computers need much more process-
ing power, memory, and storage capacity than personal computers.
Servers
Recall from Lesson 2 that a server is a computer that provides network services 
such as e-mail to client computers. Some servers look similar to the tower used with 
desktop computers, while others look like racks containing cases of storage media. 
See Figure 6–16.

Figure 6–16  Types of servers
Servers are dedicated to handling data with minimal user interaction. They do not 
include optical storage drives, speakers, high-end graphics displays, or other periph-
erals that make computers entertaining to use. Most include system components 
only—no monitor, keyboard, or other peripherals for users to provide input with.
A server is usually dedicated to a single type of task. A Web server handles 
the exchange of information across the Internet. For example, an Internet service 
provider (ISP) is a company that uses Web servers to provide Internet access to sub-
scribers for activities such as viewing Web pages, sending and receiving e-mail, and 
transferring files. Large corporations use enterprise servers to provide employees 
access to special software used to run the company’s business. Smaller businesses 
use file servers to share files and programs among employees.
A basic server can have processing, memory, and storage capabilities similar 
to a powerful desktop computer. As the number of server users increases, servers 
must be able to increase their processing capacity to handle the additional data, a 
feature called scalability. The people who manage servers boost processing capacity 
by installing additional processors, typically similar to those in a personal computer.
Servers with thousands of users also need expanded memory, often ranging 
from 12 to 32 GB of RAM, and additional high-capacity storage devices for backups 
of data. All servers also need a reliable network adapter, which is a card installed on 
the motherboard that connects the server to a larger network or the Internet.

Servers and the Environment
As the popularity of the Internet and the Web has increased, server usage has skyrocketed. The high-­
performance components in a server use a lot of power to respond to users’ requests. Servers that provide 
access to online games, for example, or social networking sites such as Facebook, are grouped together in 
vast facilities called data centers or server farms. Companies often run the data centers around the clock 
and keep backup generators on standby so users don’t experience interruptions in service. The New York 
Times estimates that data centers around the world use about 30 billion watts of available electricity, 
which is equivalent to the electricity provided by 30 nuclear power plants. Most data centers use this 
power inefficiently, releasing the excess as air and water pollution. Eventually, this drain on power will 
affect other essential industries, and the increase in pollution will affect everyone. Data centers are not 
alone in their responsibility for reducing their power consumption. Anyone who accesses the Internet is 
contributing to the problem and can raise awareness to develop solutions.
ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY
Mainframes
A mainframe computer is a powerful computer designed for processing huge 
amounts of data for hundreds or thousands of users at the same time. Mainframe 
computers are larger and more expensive than servers, and are typically located in 
climate-controlled, secure data centers to keep the processing components cool and 
the data safe. See Figure 6–17.
◗  Vocabulary
mainframe computer
Figure 6–17  Mainframe computers in a data center

Typical tasks for a mainframe computer include processing payroll and billing 
operations for a large corporation, handling millions of credit card transactions for 
a bank, gathering and tabulating census information for the U.S. government, and 
scheduling flights for an airline.

Mod1-182	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Although both servers and mainframes can process data for thousands of users, 
these types of computers are different in terms of their design and usage. Mainframes 
are designed to handle extremely large volumes of data on their own, while serv-
ers transfer data around a network, responding to requests from client computers to 
retrieve, send, and store data. In fact, mainframes can store hundreds to thousands of 
times as much data as a server and access it much more quickly. Large organizations 
rely on mainframes to process and store records of data that are too large for other 
computers. In contrast, organizations use servers to share data and provide services 
to other computers, especially for communication.
Data storage capacity is one reason that mainframes are much more expen-
sive than servers, starting around $75,000 for a mainframe computer compared to 
$500 for a server. Another reason is that mainframes use many processors power-
ful enough to provide the stability, reliability, and accuracy that businesses such as 
financial institutions, insurance companies, and utilities need, where a disruption in 
computer service would be very costly or dangerous. Recently manufactured main-
frames use processors with six cores that each run at processing speeds of 5.5 GHz 
and can be increased to 120 cores with 3 terabytes of memory. Because of these 
powerful components, most mainframe computers can run without interruption for 
decades, which is why they are worth the investment to large organizations.
Supercomputers
A supercomputer is also a very powerful computer distinguished by its processing 
capacity, especially its speed of calculation. To be classified as a supercomputer, 
a computer must be one of the fastest computers in the world. See Figure 6–18.
◗  Vocabulary
supercomputer
Above and Beyond
As of June 2013, the fastest 
supercomputer in the world was 
the Tianhe-2, which was built in 
China for around $3 billion. It 
can process data for a sustained 
period at a rate of more than 2.5 
petaflops per second, which is 
the equivalent of 2,500 trillion 
calculations per second.
Figure 6–18  Supercomputer
Rather than using the quad-core processors that personal computers use, super-
computers have processors with a million or more cores. The extraordinary power 
of supercomputers is used primarily for scientific applications that need to perform 
complex calculations very rapidly, such as launching astronauts or robots into space.

lesson 6  Classifying and Evaluating Computers	
Mod1-183 
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
A personal computer is a computing device that can perform 
input, processing, output, and storage activities on its own and 
is designed to be used by one person at a time.
n 
The personal computer you decide to buy depends on how you 
plan to use it, your budget, and its value, which is the quality 
of the computer’s features, construction, and components com-
pared to the price.
n 
Computer use can be basic, intermediate, or advanced. Basic 
usage involves occasionally visiting Web pages and creat-
ing word-processing documents. Intermediate usage involves 
more frequent work on the computer to access the Internet 
and productivity software. Advanced usage involves tasks that 
require the maximum or near the maximum amounts available 
in processing speed, memory usage, or storage capacity.
n 
The quality of a computer is determined primarily by the per-
formance of its system components, including the capacities 
and speeds of the processor, RAM, and storage devices.
n 
When considering a personal computer to purchase, you can 
select from four major types: desktop computers, laptops, tab-
lets, and smartphones.
n 
A desktop computer fits on or next to a desk, is designed to be 
stationary, and runs on power from a wall outlet. With a tradi-
tional desktop computer, the system unit, monitor, keyboard, 
and pointing devices are separate pieces of equipment. The 
computer case containing the processing components is called 
a tower.
n 
A recently developed type of desktop computer is called an 
all-in-one desktop, which houses the processing components 
in the same case that holds the screen, not in a tower.
n 
Traditional desktop computers are preferred by computer 
enthusiasts who plan to upgrade their systems. People who 
want a desktop computer but lack enough physical space can 
consider an all-in-one desktop, which is more compact than a 
traditional desktop computer, can be moved more easily, often 
includes a touchscreen, and has a sleek, attractive style.
n 
A laptop computer (sometimes called a notebook) is a light-
weight mobile computer about the size of a paper notebook 
that includes the system components, keyboard, pointing 
device, and display monitor in a single unit.
n 
Today’s laptops have as much computing power and perform 
as well as most desktop computers because laptops can include 
top-notch processors and large amounts of RAM and hard disk 
storage capacity. However, because it costs more to produce 
components that fit a laptop’s compact design, laptops are 
slightly more expensive than desktop computers with the same 
power, speed, and storage capacity.
n 
Netbook computers (also called ultrabooks) look like lap-
tops but are smaller and lighter, have less power and storage 
Summary
capacity, lack a CD/DVD drive, and provide a smaller key-
board and display screen, but include batteries that hold a 
charge longer.
n 
Like laptops, tablets run on battery power and can be plugged 
into a wall outlet as necessary. True tablets use a slate design; 
they are rigid and do not fold. Convertible tablets use a hybrid 
design that includes a swivel screen or removable keyboard so 
you can use the computer as a laptop or tablet.
n 
To compare tablets and laptops in general, consider their input 
devices, battery life, storage capacity, performance, physical 
factors, and price as well as your computer usage.
n 
Smartphones connect wirelessly to the Internet, include built-
in cameras, music players, and global positioning systems, and 
let you send and receive phone calls, e-mail messages, and text 
messages.
n 
To evaluate smartphones, you can use the same set of criteria 
for comparing laptops and tablets: input devices, battery life, 
storage capacity, performance, physical factors, price, and 
computer usage.
n 
Mobile devices besides laptops, tablets, and smartphones 
include electronic book (e-book) readers, portable media play-
ers, and handheld game devices.
n 
An embedded computer is a processor built into a household 
appliance or other device. Its appeal and strength are that it 
adds computing power to a device without needing interven-
tion from a user.
n 
Servers, mainframes, and supercomputers are large computers 
because they are designed for use by up to tens of thousands of 
people in many cases. To support that many users, large com-
puters need much more processing power, memory, and stor-
age capacity than personal computers.
n 
Servers are dedicated to handling data with minimal user inter-
action. Most include system components only—no monitor, 
keyboard, or other peripherals. Types of servers include Web 
servers, enterprise servers, and file servers.
n 
A basic server can have processing, memory, and storage capa-
bilities similar to a powerful desktop computer. As the number 
of server users increases, servers must be able to increase their 
processing capacity to handle the additional data, a feature 
called scalability.
n 
A mainframe computer is a powerful computer that is larger 
and more expensive than a server and is designed for pro-
cessing huge amounts of data with stability, reliability, and 
accuracy.
n 
To be classified as a supercomputer, a computer must be one 
of the fastest computers in the world. Supercomputers are used 
primarily for scientific applications that need to perform com-
plex calculations very rapidly.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
In this lesson, you learn about installing application software, utility programs, and 
operating systems on various types of computing devices, including desktop com-
puters and mobile computers. The steps for installing software varies depending on 
how the software is distributed, such as on a DVD or on a Web site. You also learn 
how to uninstall software, which you might do when you no longer use the software 
or when the software is causing system problems, and then reinstall it. Finally, you 
survey the licenses and terms users agree to when installing and using software.
Installing Software
When you purchase a personal computer, it already contains software such as the 
operating system, utility programs, and some basic applications so you can use the 
computer as soon as you turn it on. Eventually, you will probably want to install 
other software to perform productivity tasks, enjoy games and other entertainments, 
and add tools that enhance the operating system or improve system performance. 
Recall from Lesson 2 that when you install software, you move a copy of the soft-
ware from its distribution location to your computer. A setup program is included 
with the software to guide you through the installation steps and prepare the software 
so you can use it on your computer.
The method you use to install software varies depending on the type of personal 
computer you are using, the type of software you are installing, and how it is distrib-
uted. You typically install four types of software: desktop applications, Windows 8 
apps, mobile apps, and utility programs such as drivers and system tools. Recall that 
a desktop application is a program that opens and runs in a window on the desktop. 
The term usually applies to Windows applications, but includes those for Mac and 
Linux applications as well. You install desktop applications on desktop computers 
and laptops.
As you know, a Windows 8 app is one you start from the Start screen; it then 
takes up the entire screen instead of opening in a window on the desktop. You 
can install and run Windows 8 apps on a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet with 
Windows 8 installed.
A mobile app is specifically designed for a handheld computer, such as a tablet 
or smartphone. For example, applications developed for Windows RT are mobile 
apps, as are those created for the Apple iPad and Android phones.
Table 7–1 provides an overview of the types of software you can install on a 
personal computer.

Quick Tip
Besides application software and 
utility programs, you can also 
install an operating system on 
a computer, though you might 
only do so if you were ­upgrading 
from one major release of the 
­operating system to another, 
such as from Windows 7 to 
Windows 8.

Overview of Installation Steps
You can install software using one of three distribution methods: CD or DVD, a 
compressed file on a Web site, or a store app, such as an Apple App Store app or a 
Windows Store app. If you receive software on a CD or DVD, you insert the disc 
in a CD/DVD drive on your computer and wait for the setup program to start. If the 
setup program does not start automatically, display the files on the disc using a file 
manager such as File Explorer, and then double-click the setup program file, which 
usually has a name similar to setup.exe. See Figure 7–1.
The setup program guides you through the steps to install the software, ­including 
choosing the components you want to install and selecting a folder for the software. 
See Figure 7–2.

Mod1-192	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Another way to install software is from a Web site, such as one provided by 
a software developer or publisher. In this case, the software and a setup program 
are contained in a single compressed file available on the Web site. To install soft-
ware using this distribution method, you select options on a Web page such as the 
operating system you are using and the language for the software, and then click 
a link or button to download and save the compressed file on your hard disk. See 
Figure 7–3.
Quick Tip
Compressed files containing 
Windows software can have an 
.exe, .msi, or.zip extension, while 
those for Mac software usually 
have a .dmg extension.

Usually, the setup program starts as soon as the file is downloaded. If it does 
not, you use a file manager to extract the files from the compressed file, and then 
double-click the setup.exe file to start the setup program. If the compressed file is 
not too large, you can bypass saving and extracting the files by choosing to run the 
setup program immediately instead. Figure 7–4 illustrates the process of install-
ing a mouse driver from a compressed file on a Web site to a computer running 
Windows 8.

When you find an app you want to install, you use a button or link to purchase 
the app, if necessary, and then download and install it automatically. See Figure 7–6.
Quick Tip
You install software upgrades 
the same way you install new 
­software: using a CD or DVD, 
Web site, or store app.
Installation Tasks
Depending on the size of the files, installation can take from a few seconds to several 
minutes if you are installing a desktop application, mobile app, or utility program. 
Installing an operating system takes longer, sometimes up to an hour, and requires 
you to restart your computer one or more times.
If you are installing software on a personal computer, the setup program typi-
cally performs the following tasks:
n	
Copies files—The setup program copies files from the distribution location to 
your hard disk, and then creates a log to indicate where it stores files during 
installation.
n 
Extracts files—If the files are stored in a compressed file, the setup program 
extracts them so they can all be used in the installation. The setup program 
might also create folders and subfolders for the files, usually in a folder in 
the root directory named Program Files or Program Files (x86). For example, 
Microsoft Office is stored in subfolders of the Program Files ▶ Microsoft Office 
folder. This program folder contains most of the files the application needs to 
run. (The setup program also stores a few files in system folders.) The program 
folder is different from the folder where you download the files and where the 
setup program extracts them. If the files in the program folder are corrupted, you 
can use the extracted files to reinstall the software.

lesson 7  Software Management	
Mod1-195 
n 
Checks for existing versions of the software—The setup program scans for 
other versions of the software. If it finds an earlier version, it might need to 
uninstall it first or it might be able to use files already installed on your com-
puter. If it finds the current version of the software and all the files are up to 
date, the setup program stops and displays a message indicating the software is 
already installed.
n 
Verifies system requirements—The setup program checks system components, 
such as RAM and the hard drive, to make sure they have enough capacity to run 
and store the software. If your computer does not meet the minimum system 
requirements, the setup program stops and displays a message describing the 
problem.
n 
Finds drivers and other system files—If you are installing application software, 
the setup program looks for and activates drivers the software uses, such as 
printer drivers. It also looks for system files it might need to provide services 
such as Internet access.
n 
Updates system files—The setup program provides configuration data to the 
operating system so it can run the software. On a Windows computer, this infor-
mation is stored in the Windows registry, a database of information about your 
computer’s configuration.
n 
Provides a way to start the software—The setup program adds a button, icon, or 
tile to the graphical user interface so you can start the software. For example, it 
adds a tile to the Windows 8 Start screen or an icon to the iPad home screen.
In Step-by-Step 7.1, you download and install Free Alarm Clock, a Windows 
desktop application you can use to set alarms as reminders for events and other activ-
ities. The software and setup program are available on the developer’s Web site in 
a compressed file. In the following steps, you download and install the Free Alarm 
Clock software. In Step-by-Step 7.2, you uninstall it.
To install software on a Windows computer, you need to be signed in using an 
Administrator account or you must know the Administrator’s password. If you are not 
allowed to use an Administrator account or if you do not know the Administrator’s 
password, read but do not perform the following steps.
Because you are installing a desktop application, it is more convenient to use 
the version of Internet Explorer available on the desktop to download and install the 
Free Alarm Clock software.
Above and Beyond
The Windows registry stores con-
figuration settings and options 
about the hardware and software 
on your computer. For example, 
to indicate an application’s 
default settings, the setup pro-
gram enters them in the registry. 
Windows refers to the registry 
settings constantly as it runs 
software, accesses hardware, and 
performs other operating system 
tasks. You should not change 
the registry yourself—Windows 
and applications make necessary 
changes automatically—because 
an incorrect setting could disable 
your entire system. However, 
occasionally a technical expert 
will instruct you to change a set-
ting in the registry, usually after 
explaining how to back it up. 
If you trust the expert, you can 
follow the instructions to back up 
and then change the registry.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Uninstalling Software
You can uninstall almost any software installed on your computer, including applica-
tions, utility programs, and operating systems. You typically uninstall an application 
if you no longer use it. Doing so frees up space on your hard disk, sometimes a signif-
icant amount of space, depending on the software. To uninstall a desktop application 
from a Windows computer, you use an uninstaller, which is a tool similar to a setup 
program. Uninstallers are provided with installed software so you can completely 
remove the software from your computer. If you simply delete the program folder of 
a Windows desktop application, system files still contain configuration settings and 
other data that can slow system performance or prevent the operating system from 
loading correctly. In addition, most Windows applications store files in more than 
one folder, and you need the uninstaller to track them down. You use a Control Panel 
tool called Programs and Features to start an uninstaller that ­completely removes a 
desktop application from your computer.
In most cases, you can uninstall a desktop application from a Mac by dragging 
the application’s icon to the Trash, a Mac OS X tool similar to the Windows Recycle 
Bin. Mac OS X performs a few clean-up tasks behind the scenes. Larger applications 
or those that interact with other applications, such as Microsoft Office for Mac, pro-
vide an uninstaller that you use to thoroughly remove an application.
To uninstall a Windows 8 app, you right-click the app’s tile on the Start screen or 
Apps screen, and then click the Uninstall button on the Apps bar. See Figure 7–10. 
The app’s uninstaller takes care of completely removing the software from your 
computer.

To uninstall a mobile app from an Android tablet or smartphone, you use the 
Application manager on the Settings menu. The Application manager lists all the 
apps installed on the device. You select the app you want to uninstall, and then tap 
the Uninstall button. Uninstalling is even more straightforward on an iPhone, iPad, 
or iPod Touch: you press and hold the app’s icon until the icon begins to shake and 
a circled X appears on the icon, and then you tap the X to uninstall the app. See

You can also uninstall a driver or utility program if you are having trouble with 
a device or no longer use the program. In addition, a hardware manufacturer might 
instruct you to uninstall a driver if you upgrade to new hardware such as a moni-
tor or video card. In all cases, you should use an uninstaller to uninstall the driver 
or utility program from your computer so you can remove the files as safely as 
­possible. Uninstallers for some system tools are listed in the Programs and Features 
window that you access from the Control Panel. Others are included with the tool 
itself. For example, as you learned in Lesson 5, you can open the Properties dialog 
box for a device, click the Driver tab, and then click the Uninstall button to uninstall 
the driver.
Uninstalling an operating system means deleting it from your computer. If you 
don’t immediately replace the deleted operating system with a new one, your com-
puter won’t run. You might want to uninstall the operating system when you are 
preparing to recycle a computer and need to remove any personal information such 
as passwords stored in system files. In that case, you should first back up and then 
thoroughly remove all of your data. You can use a system tool called a disk wiper or 
disk eraser to uninstall the operating system and remove your data at the same time. 
If you are selling or donating your computer, you can wipe the disk and then reinstall 
an operating system from CDs or a DVD so the new owner has an operating system 
to work with.
Above and Beyond
It is possible to install more 
than one operating system on 
a ­computer, which is called a 
­dual-boot or multiboot system. 
Each operating system resides 
on its own hard drive or ­partition, 
which is a separate part of a 
hard drive. For example, for 
one ­computer you could install 
Windows on one hard drive or 
partition, and Linux on another. 
You could uninstall the operating 
system from one drive or parti-
tion and still be able to run the 
computer using the remaining 
operating system.

Uninstalling Tasks
If you are uninstalling software other than an operating system on a personal com-
puter, the uninstaller typically performs the following tasks:
n 
Deletes files—The uninstaller refers to the log created by the setup program to 
locate and then delete the software’s files.
n 
Restores system settings—If the setup program changed system settings, the 
uninstaller restores them to their original settings. On a Windows computer, 
this includes registry entries. The uninstaller refers to the setup log again and 
reverses the changes to the registry.
n 
Restores the graphical user interface—The uninstaller removes the button, icon, 
or tile for starting the software from the graphical user interface.
In Step-by-Step 7.2, you uninstall the Free Alarm Clock software using the

Reinstalling Software
If you’ve installed software but it’s not running properly, you can reinstall it. For 
example, if you install a desktop application, Windows 8 app, or mobile app, try 
to start the software as usual, and then discover that the application doesn’t start, 
you can uninstall the software and try installing it again on the same computer. 
Reinstalling can replace files that might have become corrupted during or shortly 
after installation. In fact, corrupt or missing files is the most common cause of soft-
ware problems, and uninstalling then reinstalling is the easiest way to solve it.
To reinstall a desktop application, Windows 8 app, or mobile app on the same 
device as the original software, you can complete the following general steps:
	 1.	 Uninstall the software as described in the “Uninstalling Software” section of 
this lesson.
	 2.	 Restart the computer. This resets the computer and frees system resources, 
greatly reducing the possibility of corrupting a file.
Quick Tip
The buttons on the toolbar vary 
depending on the uninstaller for 
the selected software. You might 
see the Uninstall/Change button, 
or the Repair button, which you 
can use to replace damaged 
­application or system files with 
original files.

	 3.	 Install the software as described in the “Installing Software” section of this les-
son. If possible, select a Web site or store app as the distribution location so you 
can install a recent version of the software.
	 4.	 If the setup program prompts you to check for and install updates, choose 
the option to do so. In most cases, it’s best to install the most recent version 
available.
Developers of system software don’t usually require you to uninstall programs 
such as drivers before reinstalling the software. If you received the software on a 
CD or DVD, which might be the case with drivers for hardware you purchased, you 
can insert the disc in a CD/DVD drive and wait for the setup program to start or 
double-click the setup.exe file in File Explorer to start it yourself. If updates have 
been installed for the drivers, the software on the disc is probably older than the 
software currently installed on your computer. In this case, reinstalling the soft-
ware replaces the most current drivers with older drivers that might not be compat-
ible with new hardware.
Reinstalling an Operating System
If an electrical storm, power surge, virus, or another threat causes system problems 
severe enough to prevent your operating system from running normally, you can 
reinstall it. Most setup programs or the operating systems themselves provide an 
option to install a fresh copy of the operating system while retaining your data and 
settings. Some also retain your application software. For example, you can reinstall 
Windows 8 using a Refresh option that retains your original Windows 8 apps, though 
not your desktop applications. You’ll learn how to refresh Windows 8 in Step-by-
Step 7.3. You can reinstall other operating systems as follows:
n 
Mac OS X—You can reinstall Mac OS X by choosing the Restart command on 
the Apple menu, and then holding down the Command+R keys as the computer 
restarts. When an option to reinstall Mac OS X appears on the screen, click it 
to download and install the software from an Apple server. (You must be con-
nected to the Internet to reinstall.) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete 
the reinstallation. Reinstalling keeps your data files and settings intact.
n 
Linux—The method to reinstall varies depending on the Linux distribution. For 
most distributions, you reinstall using your original installation media, which 
overwrites all the files except your data files. However, you can back up the 
files containing your settings and then restore the files to your fresh installation 
of Linux.
n 
iOS—You can reinstall or update iOS by connecting your smartphone or ­tablet 
to the Internet or to a computer where iTunes software is installed. (iTunes 
is software you use to play, download, and organize digital media files on a 
­personal computer.) With the first method, you use the General category in 
the Settings app to select the Software Update command, and then follow the 
­on-screen instructions. To use iTunes, you connect your smartphone or tablet to 
a desktop or laptop computer running iTunes. On the iTunes menu, click Check 
for Updates and then follow the on-screen instructions to reinstall iOS.
n 
Android—You can reinstall or update Android by using the Settings app. Select 
a command called About Tablet or something similar, and then choose System 
Updates to check for an update or reinstall Android. Manufacturers of Android 
smartphones and tablets also send notices about updates to their firmware when 
it’s available. (Recall that firmware consists of instructions stored on a ROM 
chip, so it is a combination of hardware and software.) To reinstall firmware on 
your own, however, you need to contact the manufacturer directly and then send 
the device to them for reinstallation.
Quick Tip
Before you reinstall an operating 
system, you must back up your 
data files. Lesson 10 provides 
detailed instructions for creating 
backups.
Above and Beyond
Desktop operating systems allow 
you to make a system ­recovery 
disk (typically a CD or DVD) to 
make sure you can start the 
computer and access recovery 
tools if something goes wrong 
with your operating system. 
Experts recommend that you 
create a system recovery disk 
right after you install or upgrade 
an operating system or purchase 
a new computer. The system 
recovery disk contains only files 
the operating system needs to 
start and the files to provide you 
with troubleshooting and system 
repair tools.

	 1.	 On the desktop, display the Charms bar, and then click the Settings charm.
	 2.	 Click Change PC settings on the Settings menu to display the PC set-
tings screen.
	 3.	 Click Update and recovery in the left pane to display the Update and 
recovery options.
	 4.	 Click Recovery in the left pane to display the Refresh tool, which is 
titled “Refresh your PC without affecting your files,” in the right pane. 
See Figure 7–13. (You will not refresh your computer at this time.)
Windows 8 includes the Refresh tool, which installs a fresh copy of Windows 
on your computer and retains your data, settings, and original Windows 8 apps, 
but not desktop applications. The Refresh tool is designed to reinstall Windows 8 
if your system is unstable; that is, you can start the computer and run applications, 
but receive error messages or have trouble opening and using system tools. If you 
are having problems even starting Windows, you can use the Reset tool to remove 
all of your files and applications, reinstall Windows, and then change all of your 
system settings to their defaults. The Reset tool is also ideal if you are disposing of 
your computer or giving it away because it removes all of your data and personal 
information.
While using the Refresh or Reset tool, Windows needs to access setup files 
stored on its installation or recovery medium. You can use the original installation 
medium (such as the USB drive or DVD containing the setup program and files) 
or a system recovery disk if you made one during the original installation of the 
operating system.
In Step-by-Step 7.3, you learn about the Refresh and Reset tools in Windows 8, 
which you can access on the PC settings screen. If you are in a computer lab, you 
probably cannot access the Refresh and Reset tools. In that case, read but do not 
perform the following steps.

Understanding Software Licenses
When you purchase software, you do not actually own the software. Instead, you are 
purchasing a software license, a legal agreement that specifies how you can install 
and use the software. Most software is distributed using a single-user license (also 
called a single-seat license), which gives only one person the right to install and use 
the software.
Instead of a single-user license, some software is distributed using a site 
license (also called a network license or volume license), usually to organizations 
including businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies. With a 
site license, multiple users can access the software at the same time. The organi-
zation might install copies of the software on many computers or one copy on a 
server that can be accessed by many computers. A site license offers advantages to 
the organization and the software company. For example, if a single-user license 
for software costs $200, the software company might offer a site license for 
$100 per user. An organization with 10 employees pays $1,000 instead of $2,000, 
and the software company receives a large payment for the initial purchase and 
another for upgrades.
The software license is summarized in the end user license agreement 
(EULA), which is usually displayed as you install software, and outlines the terms 
and guidelines for your legal use of the software. It gives you the option to accept 
or reject the terms of the agreement. If you accept, you can continue to install the 
software. If you reject the terms, the installation does not continue. Figure 7–14 
shows a typical EULA.

Above and Beyond
Even if the software license 
does not include a notice such 
as © 2017, almost all software 
is protected by copyright, which 
gives authors, artists, and other 
creators of original work exclusive 
rights to duplicate, publish, and 
sell their material. Copyright law 
allows you to copy the software 
from its distribution location to 
your computer when you install 
it and to make a backup copy of 
the software. It is illegal to copy 
and distribute the software to 
other users unless the software 
license specifically allows you 
to do so.

lesson 7  Software Management	
Mod1-205 
Be sure to read the EULA carefully so you understand your legal obligations. 
For example, some EULAs state that you can install the software on up to two com-
puters that belong to the same person. Some might indicate that you are installing a 
student or academic edition and cannot use it for commercial or revenue-generating 
activities.
In addition to accepting the EULA during installation, you might also need to 
register or activate software after installing it. Software registration involves identi-
fying yourself to the software manufacturer as the person who purchased a copy of 
the software. You usually complete an online form at the software company’s Web 
site and provide your name and other personal information so you can receive prod-
uct support and notices about upgrades. Software registration is optional. However, 
some software companies require you to activate your copy of the software, which 
often involves entering a serial number or activation key provided with the prod-
uct packaging or electronic confirmation notice. Activation is a way that software 
developers can ensure you install the software only on the number of computers 
specified in the license. Many software developers let you use their software for a 
trial period, such as 30 days, to determine whether you want to purchase it. After 
the trial period, you must pay to activate the software or it will stop working. See 
Figure 7–15. Other types of trial software disable some features, such as the ability 
to save or print documents.
Quick Tip
You can read the EULA for most 
software even after you install it. 
In Microsoft Office applications, 
for example, you can click the 
FILE tab, click Account, click 
About application, such as About 
Word, and then click View the 
Microsoft Software License Terms.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Software Piracy
Illegally copying and distributing software is called software piracy. According to the Business Software 
Alliance (BSA), more than $11 billion is lost to software piracy each year. Types of software piracy include 
copying a game on removable media and giving it to a friend; sharing license or activation codes; down-
loading software posted online by another user without authorization; and counterfeiting software (dupli-
cating and reselling software as if it were original). Besides violating copyright law, software piracy harms 
the software developer through the loss of revenue and the incentive to create new software or improve 
an application. In addition, counterfeit software typically contains flaws that affect the reliability of the 
software. Some flaws are actually malware intended to surreptitiously access computer data such as pass-
words and credit card numbers. On the other hand, respecting copyright and the terms of software licenses 
rewards people and companies that produce quality software and stimulates technological innovation.
ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY
The people and organizations that develop software determine how to make it 
available to users, such as selling it through retail stores and Web sites, so it earns 
a profit, or providing it free or for a nominal fee that covers distribution expenses. 
Developers can make software available to users in the following forms, and each of 
these forms has a specific software license:
n 
Commercial software—Commercial software is developed and sold for profit 
usually through retail stores and Web sites. Operating systems such as Windows 
and Mac OS X are commercial software, though they come preinstalled when 
you purchase a computer. Some commercial software, such as a Web app, is 
provided on a subscription basis so you pay a monthly fee to use the software 
under the terms of the software license.
 
Custom software is a type of commercial software that is not sold in retail 
outlets. Instead, an organization contracts with one or more programmers or a 
programming company to develop software that fits the organization’s unique 
needs. Custom software is sold only to the organization that contracted for it, 
and has a license that indicates the organization cannot resell the software or 
distribute it outside of the organization.
n 
Shareware—Shareware is distributed free of charge as a download on the Web, 
often by single programmers who want to distribute their software indepen-
dently without packaging or advertising expenses. After using shareware for a 
trial period, you pay the developer a small fee to continue using it. For this 
reason, shareware is sometimes called try-and-buy software. In most cases, pay-
ment is on the honor system; the software continues to run if you do not pay. 
Some developers let you set the price of the shareware depending on how valu-
able it is to you. Shareware licenses usually let you share the software by copy-
ing it and giving it to others to evaluate. Those users are also expected to pay the 
developer if they decide to continue using the software.
◗  Vocabulary
shareware
Above and Beyond
When visiting any type of Web 
site, be wary of ads that include 
a software Download button. 
The software in these ads might 
contain malware. You should only 
download software from an estab-
lished software download site, or 
from the software manufacturer’s 
Web site. Research software and 
download sites before you use 
them to learn what experts and 
other users report or recommend.

lesson 7  Software Management	
Mod1-207 
n 
Freeware—As the name suggests, freeware is software the developer makes 
available to users free of charge. As with shareware, the developer is usually a 
single programmer who provides the software as a download on the Web. The 
developer still owns the rights to the software, which means you cannot sell or 
modify it unless the license expressly permits you to do so.
n 
Open-source software—As mentioned in Lesson 1, open-source software is cre-
ated in a collaborative programming effort and released under a license that 
allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software. Linux and Android 
are examples of open-source operating systems. Open-source applications 
include Thunderbird (for e-mail) and Firefox (for Web browsing).
n 
Public domain software—Public domain software is the only type of software 
that is not copyright-protected. The software developer has either donated it 
for public use or the copyright has expired. You can freely copy, distribute, 
and even resell public domain software, though you cannot apply for a copy-
right on it.
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
When you install software, you use a setup program to guide 
you through the steps of copying the software from its distribu-
tion location to your computer, and then preparing the software 
so you can use it.
n 
The method you use to install software varies depending on the 
type of personal computer you are using, the type of software 
you are installing, and how you access it. You typically install 
four types of software: desktop applications, Windows 8 apps, 
mobile apps, and utility programs such as drivers. You obtain 
the software one of three ways: CD or DVD, a compressed file 
on a Web site, or a store app.
n 
To install software, a setup program copies and extracts files, 
checks for existing versions of the software, verifies system 
requirements, finds drivers and other system files, updates sys-
tem files, and provides a way to start the software.
n 
To uninstall a desktop application from a Windows computer, 
you use an uninstaller, which is a tool similar to a setup pro-
gram that completely removes software from your system. To 
uninstall a Windows 8 app or mobile app, you use an Uninstall 
command.
n 
You might need to uninstall a driver if a hardware manufacturer 
instructs you to do so. You can also uninstall utility programs if 
you no longer use them. In these cases, you should use an unin-
staller provided by the software to uninstall the software from 
your computer so you can remove the files as safely as possible.
n 
You rarely need to uninstall an operating system, though you 
might want to uninstall one when you are preparing to recycle 
a computer and need to remove any personal information such 
as passwords stored in system files.
n 
When you use an uninstaller, it deletes the software’s files, 
restores system settings, and restores the graphical user interface.
Summary
n 
If you’ve installed software but it’s not running properly, you 
can reinstall it. Reinstalling can replace files that might have 
become corrupted during or shortly after installation.
n 
If a threat such as an electrical storm causes problems severe 
enough to prevent your operating system from running nor-
mally, you can reinstall the operating system. In most cases, 
you can use an option to install a fresh copy of the operating 
system while retaining your data and settings.
n 
To reinstall an operating system, the computer needs to access 
setup files stored on the installation or recovery medium. Most 
desktop operating systems let you create a system recovery 
disk, which contains tools and files to help restore a computer 
if a serious system error occurs.
n 
When you purchase software, you do not actually own the soft-
ware. Instead, you are purchasing a software license, a legal 
agreement that specifies how you can install and use the soft-
ware. Most software is distributed using a single-user license, 
which gives only one person the right to install and use the 
software.
n 
Some software is distributed using a site license, which allows 
multiple users to work with the software at the same time. An 
organization might purchase a site license to install copies of 
the software on many computers or one copy on a server that 
can be accessed by many computers.
n 
The software license is summarized in the end user license 
agreement (EULA), which is displayed as you install software. 
If you accept the terms of the agreement, you can continue 
to install the software. If you reject the terms, the installation 
does not continue. You should read the EULA carefully so you 
understand your obligations as a user of the software you are 
installing.

Mod1-216	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
In this lesson, you learn about the purpose and use of application software, including 
word-processing applications, presentation software, spreadsheets, and databases. 
You also examine applications for desktop publishing, entertainment, and media 
editing. Finally, you explore typical utility programs, including those that compress 
files, manage disks, and scan for malware.
Using Application Software
The range of application software covers nearly every task you might need to 
perform, including producing documents and other types of work, exchanging 
electronic messages, accessing Web pages, watching movies, and playing games. 
In this lesson, you explore three types of applications: productivity, entertainment, 
and media-editing applications. You use productivity applications to perform work 
and other activities effectively. Productivity applications include word ­processing, 
spreadsheet, database, desktop publishing, and presentation software. Entertainment 
software is designed for viewing or playing music, videos, and photos, while media-
editing software is designed for creating and modifying graphics, animations, video, 
music, and other media.
Related applications are often packaged together and distributed in a 
software suite. For example, Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, Google Docs, and 
Apache OpenOffice are considered office suites because they typically include 
word-processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications that are useful in a 
professional or business setting. Many office suites also include a database or an 
e-mail application. Media-editing applications can also be provided in suites such 
as Adobe Creative Suite and CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, which include software 
for editing photos, creating graphics, and developing animations.
Software suites offer some advantages over installing individual applications. 
The cost of a software suite is usually less than the cost of buying each application 
separately. The software in a suite uses the same interface, so you can apply the skills 
you learn in one application to the other ­applications. Suite software is also designed 
to work together, often by sharing content. For example, in an office suite, you can 
copy a chart created in a spreadsheet and paste it in a word-processing document. A 
disadvantage is that many people use one or two suite applications most of the time, 
while rarely using the ­others, so the disk space consumed by the suite overall is not 
used efficiently.

Writing and Editing Features
Word-processing software is popular because it lets you enter and change your 
­written words easily. A feature called word wrap keeps text within the document 
margins. When the text you are typing fills a line, word wrap moves the text to 
the next line, without requiring you to press the Enter key. If you add text to a 
paragraph, word wrap reflows the paragraph to accommodate the new text. If 
you change the margins, word wrap also adjusts the paragraph so that all the text 
remains within the new margins.
Quick Tip
This lesson presents an overview 
of application software; you work 
extensively with Microsoft Office 
applications such as Microsoft 
Word in Module 2.

Word-Processing Software
You use word-processing software such as Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Google 
Document, and Corel WordPerfect to produce written documents such as reports, 
letters, memos, research papers, and flyers. As you are working on a document, you 
can enter and reorganize text, correct errors, insert graphics, and format the docu-
ment before producing a final version.
A typical word-processing application such as Microsoft Word, shown in 
Figure 8–1, displays a work area where you create and edit a document along with 
controls for viewing, formatting, and managing the document.

Mod1-218	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
To reduce the number of errors in a document, you can use a spelling checker, 
which is a feature of a word-processing application that compares the spelling of 
one or more words to the words in its electronic dictionary, flags the ones that 
might be misspelled, and offers possible corrections. Figure 8–2 shows the spell-
ing checker in Google Document. Many word-processing applications also include 
a grammar checker, which marks common grammar errors such as incomplete 
sentences and suggests corrections. A similar feature available in some word- 
processing applications is a thesaurus, which provides one or more synonyms 
(words with the same meaning) and sometimes antonyms (words with the opposite 
meaning) for a selected word.

The Search or Find feature in word-processing applications is especially useful 
if you are working with a long document and you need to locate a specific word or 
phrase. You can use the Replace feature with the Search or Find feature to quickly 
locate an individual instance or all instances of a word or phrase and then replace 
it with another one. For example, if you are writing a report for your company, and 
you want to use the acronym for the company instead of the company’s full name 
throughout the report, you can use the Search and Replace features to locate all 
instances of the full company name, and replace those with the company’s acronym 
all at once.
Formatting Features
Word-processing applications provide formatting features so you can make docu-
ments look professional and appealing. Formatting refers to the appearance and 
arrangement of elements on a page. For example, basic formatting features allow 
you to make headings larger than other text, insert bulleted lists, apply color to text 
and other elements, and change the margins of the page. You use more advanced for-
matting features to place text and graphics side by side, arrange text into newspaper-
style columns, and add shadows to words and shapes.

Collaboration Features
Because groups of people work together to produce many of the documents in profes-
sional and academic settings, word-processing software provides features that make 
it possible to collaborate. For example, one or more people can review a Microsoft 
Word document and insert personalized comments or mark their changes so the 
author can track them. Using Google Document, you can post a document online and 
invite others to edit it in real time. Most word-processing applications include tools 
to easily share documents via e-mail, a cloud storage location such as SkyDrive or 
iCloud, or a blog. (A blog, short for web log, is a Web site where one or more authors 
regularly post commentaries, opinions, and other personal information.)
Desktop Publishing Software
Desktop publishing (DTP) software is similar to word-processing software because 
you use it to create documents containing text and graphics. However, DTP soft-
ware includes more sophisticated features that enable you to use a personal computer 
to arrange text and graphics on a page to create and print high-quality documents 
such as brochures, magazines, newspapers, and books that would typically be pro-
duced by professional typographers. Adobe InDesign, QuarkXPress, and Microsoft 
Publisher are examples of DTP software.
Layout Features
When you work with DTP software, you use frames, which are movable rectangu-
lar areas on a page in which you enter text or graphics. One page usually has many 
frames, such as a frame for the title, one or more for the body text, additional frames 
for photos and graphics, and others for captions or sidebars. (A sidebar is a short 
article, often appearing in a box, that appears alongside a main article or other con-
tent to provide additional explanation or supporting material.) To lay out a page, you 
move the frames to specific locations. See Figure 8–3.

Mod1-220	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
As you move a frame, you can use layout grids, guides, and snapping to place 
the frame precisely. These tools appear on-screen only, not on the printed page. A 
layout grid divides the page into columns and rows and looks like graph paper. You 
can use a layout grid to place a frame precisely and to balance the text and graphics 
on the page. A guide is usually a colored line or shape that appears to help you align 
an object to the layout grid or to other objects. If you drag a frame close to a guide 
and then release the mouse button, the snapping feature aligns the frame to the grid 
or the other object.
Text Features
Besides basic text-editing features, DTP software lets you thread, or link, frames that 
contain text. Using this feature, you can display part of an article on one page, for 
example, and then continue the article on the next page, an arrangement that’s not 
possible without linking the frames. As you edit content, the frames adjust their text 
so it flows between frames without interruption.
Publications often need to control the amount of text that fits on a line or column 
to avoid errors such as printing the last two lines of an article on an otherwise blank 
page. They do so by controlling the word spacing, letter spacing, text alignment, 
and hyphenation, which is called text composition. DTP software includes tools that 
track text composition, highlight problems, and then let you fine-tune letter spacing, 
for example, to solve the problems.
Graphics Features
In addition to manipulating graphics by resizing shapes or cropping photos, for 
example, DTP software includes tools for creating, editing, and enhancing graphics. 
You use these tools to draw lines and shapes, add color to some or all parts of 
an ­illustration, specify colors for professional printing, and apply effects such as 
transparency, shadows, and spot lighting. Many DTP applications also provide a 
­collection of graphics you can use in your publications.
Presentation Software
You use presentation software, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, iWork Keynote, 
LibreOffice Impress, and Prezi, to organize and present text, graphics, and other 
media as a slide show. To guide you to create a slide show with visual appeal, presen-
tation software provides layouts, which are pre-set arrangements for slide content, 
including text and graphics. Layouts provide placeholders in which you can enter 
and edit text in formats that audiences can view and read easily, including head-
ings and bulleted and numbered lists. You can also use placeholders to insert tables, 
charts, pictures, and videos. Figure 8–4 shows an example of a slide show created in 
presentation software.

The original presentation appli-
cations were designed to create 
physical 35-mm slides that you 
inserted in a slide projector. One 
of the first presentation applica-
tions for Windows was Harvard 
Graphics, initially released in 
1986. At the same time, an appli-
cation called Presenter was devel-
oped for the Mac. It was renamed 
PowerPoint, sold to Microsoft, and 
converted into a Windows desktop 
application. PowerPoint quickly 
became more popular than 
Harvard Graphics, and now claims 
about 95 percent of the presenta-
tion software market.
In addition to layouts, presentation software often includes premade designs, 
which are called themes in PowerPoint, and provide a coordinated set of col-
ors, fonts, backgrounds, and effects. You can apply a theme to new and existing 
presentations.
While you are creating or editing a presentation, you can include transitions 
between slides, such as an effect that fades from one slide to the next. You can also 
animate text, shapes, photos, and other objects to draw attention to a topic or to dem-
onstrate an action.
You can usually present a slide show online or in person to a live audience. 
During the slide show, you can change the display of the pointer so it appears as a 
laser pen or highlighter, for example, control the timing of the presentation, and play 
music or sound effects.
In Step-by-Step 8.1, you start PowerPoint and then view a presentation to 
become familiar with presentation software and the presentation elements you 
can create.

Spreadsheet Software
A spreadsheet is an arrangement of text and numbers in a rectangular grid or table. 
You use spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, or LibreOffice 
Calc to organize numeric data in such a way that you can calculate, analyze, 
­interpret, and present it. This type of software is ideal for tasks such as prepar-
ing budgets, balancing checkbooks, forecasting loan payments, and maintaining  
grade books.
A typical spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel, shown in Figure 8–8, 
displays a grid of columns and rows that can contain text, numbers, and formulas. 
Excel calls this grid a worksheet, or a sheet for short.

Figure 8–8  Spreadsheet application
When you start Excel, you create a file called a workbook. By default each new 
workbook contains a worksheet named Sheet1. You can rename this worksheet and 
add new ones as you need them.
As shown in Figure 8–8, the columns in a worksheet are identified by letters and 
the rows are identified by numbers. The point where a column and a row intersect is 
called a cell. Each cell has a name, called the cell reference (or cell address), which 
is represented by its column letter and row number. For example, the first cell in a 
worksheet is cell A1, which is located in column A and row 1. The active cell is the 
currently selected cell. To identify the active cell, look for the cell surrounded by a 
thick border. The Name box also displays the cell reference of the active cell, which 
is cell A1 in Figure 8–8.

Mod1-226	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Calculation Features
The main purpose of spreadsheet software is to perform calculations. You can 
enter a column of numbers, for example, and then insert a formula to display the 
total at the bottom. A formula is a mathematical expression that provides a result. 
To aid in recalculation, you use cell references in a formula whenever possible 
instead of numbers. That way, if you change one of the numbers in the column, 
the formula recalculates the result automatically and displays an updated total. 
See Figure 8–9.

◗  Vocabulary
formula
Because of this ability to update automatically, spreadsheets are especially 
useful when you need to perform what-if analysis, which is a way to explore how 
changing numbers and other input values such as dates affect calculated results. For 
example, if you are saving money to take a vacation, you might use a spreadsheet 
like the one shown in Figure 8–9. You could use what-if analysis to answer questions 
such as “What if I saved $50 more per week? How soon would I save enough to take 
the vacation?”
Besides entering simple formulas, you can use functions, which are pre-
defined formulas that perform common calculations. For example, instead of 
entering a formula that adds five numbers in a column, such as =E7 + E8 + E9 + 
E10 + E11, you can use the SUM function =SUM(E7:E11), which is simpler and 
less prone to error. In the SUM function, “E7:E11” refers to the range of five cells 
from E7 to E11.
Charting Features
To help you analyze and present numeric data visually, spreadsheet software includes 
tools for creating charts (also called graphs). Charts show trends or relationships in 
data that you might not notice when examining columns or rows of numbers. For 
example, Figure 8–10 displays a column chart of a student’s grades in a Computer 
Literacy class. The chart clearly shows that the student is doing well on homework, 
but not on quizzes.

Database Software
A database is a collection of data organized into tables, such as a collection of base-
ball cards, an inventory of movie and TV show DVDs, or an address book of contacts. 
You use database software such as Microsoft Access, FileMaker Pro, or MySQL 
(pronounced “my sequel”) to enter, organize, update, retrieve, and produce reports 
on the electronic data in a database.
All of the data in a database is stored in one or more tables, which are composed 
of rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets. Each column in the table is a field, 
which is a single characteristic of a person, place, thing, or event. For example, 
in the Movies table shown in Figure 8–11, Title is a field containing the name of 
each movie.

Mod1-228	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
A row in a database table represents a record. Each record is a group of related 
fields. For example, a record in the Movies table contains nine fields: Movie ID, 
Title, Movie Type, Length, Director, Star, Year Released, Date Acquired, and Price.
Every table must include a primary key field, which is a field that uniquely iden-
tifies each record in the table. For example, Movie ID is the primary key field in the 
Movies table. One purpose of the primary key is to prevent duplicate entries, so no 
two records can contain the same primary key value.
Database software that works with related tables, such as Microsoft Access, is 
called relational database software. For example, the Movies database stores movie 
data in one table, and it stores information about movie types in another table. The 
Movies table contains the fields shown in Figure 8–11. The Movie Type table has 
two fields: Movie Type ID and Movie Type. Because the Movie table also contains 
the Movie Type field, you can relate, or link, the two tables through their common 
field—the Movie Type field.
By linking, or relating the two tables, you can save time and make the database 
more consistent. When you enter data for a new movie, you can choose the movie 
type from a list to specify Science Fiction, for example. Without the list from 
the related table, you might enter Sci Fi or Fantasy instead, which would make 
the database inconsistent and create problems when you retrieve data.
Data-Entry Features
When you enter records of data directly into a table, you use a table datasheet, which 
is similar to a spreadsheet. Besides tables, a database file can contain other objects, 
which are containers for data. Instead of entering data directly into a table, you can 
use an object called a form. You can design forms so they are visually attractive and 
easy to use, which makes data entry more efficient. Forms can also display records 
from different tables. See Figure 8–12.

Mod1-229 
Data-Retrieval Features
To extract meaningful data from a database, you can create a query, which is a 
request for specific data that meets set criteria. For example, you could create a query 
displaying all the movies in your database that star Woody Allen or those classified 
as comedies. Queries often provide the basis for reports, which are formatted print-
outs or displays of data. Both queries and reports can include calculations such as 
subtotals and totals.
Comparing Spreadsheets and Databases
Now that you have learned about spreadsheet and database software, you might 
be noticing their similarities. Both types of software are designed for organiz-
ing, managing, and tracking data that is initially entered and stored in columns 
and rows. How do you know when to create a spreadsheet and when to create 
a database?
Many people prefer working with spreadsheets because they let you enter data 
and see results after a short amount of setup time. Spreadsheet software is also easier 
to learn, especially for novices, and provides formatting features that databases usu-
ally do not. Most importantly, although both spreadsheets and databases perform 
calculations, spreadsheets typically offer more sophisticated mathematical functions 
than databases. If your focus is on using numerical data to make calculations or a 
quick analysis, create a spreadsheet.
However, if your focus is on storing other types of data for the long term and 
manipulating it efficiently, create a database. The advantages databases offer are the 
result of being able to relate tables to each other. For example, suppose you earn 
extra money providing pet care services. You want to keep track of owners, pets, the 
type of care they need, and so on. You could create a spreadsheet listing all of this 
information, as shown in Figure 8–13.

Duplicate data
Figure 8–13  Data in a spreadsheet
Dale Franklin has two pets, so you must enter his name, address, and phone 
number twice. If Dale moves or changes his phone number, you must remember to 
make that change in two places. You can avoid this data duplication by creating and 
relating two tables in a relational database, one for owner data and another for pet 
data. See Figure 8–14.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
So in the database, you only need to enter Dale Franklin’s information once. 
If he moves or changes his phone number, you modify the data in the Owner table 
only. Any forms, reports, or queries that use data from the Owner table are updated 
automatically. If he adopts a new pet, you add that data only to the Pet table ­without 
needing to change or reenter any owner data. You could also track how much you 
charge for each service in a separate table, and then perform calculations on that 
data. Because the focus is still on manipulating data and not on performing the 
­calculations, a database is a better choice for this task.
Entertainment Software
Entertainment software includes applications that let you download and listen to 
music or the radio, watch movies and television shows, and play games. Some 
applications, such as Apple iTunes, provide access to more than one type of digital 
media, including songs, movies, TV shows, and radio stations. Other software such 
as music players, radio applications, and video players concentrate on a single type 
of media.
Music and Video Applications
You use music applications such as Windows Media Player and iTunes to build a 
collection of digital music and arrange it into playlists, which are lists of songs or 
pieces of music organized in sequence, though you can also shuffle the order. You 
can play the music files on a computer or transfer them to a handheld device such as 
a portable media player. Mobile music apps such as Google Play Music and iTunes 
for iOS are especially popular because they are designed for listening to music on 
the go. Video player software includes QuickTime, RealPlayer, and the VLC media 
player; all of these applications also play music. You use the applications to play 
videos in a variety of file formats, organize videos into playlists, and set preferences 
such as displaying or hiding subtitles.
Radio applications such as Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio work like online 
radio stations. You connect to a server providing a radio service, create an account, and 
then select music to play immediately on your desktop or mobile device. Some appli-
cations such as Pandora suggest songs and other music based on your selections and 
let you create your own stations. For example, you could create one station that plays 
music from a particular artist and another that plays only a particular genre of music.
Game Software
Game software for personal computers is one of the most popular types of software 
that people use today. Some game applications are electronic versions of physical 
games, such as Solitaire or Scrabble, have rules that are familiar or easy to grasp, 
and can be played for short periods of time. In fact, they are sometimes called casual 
games because they require little time commitment to learn and play.

Mod1-231 
Other games are more involved, requiring users to devote time to learn the intri-
cacies of the rules and options and to complete a game, which can often take many 
hours. These types of games are often referred to as long-play games. Genres of 
long-play games change frequently as technology changes, but typically include 
adventure games, in which you solve puzzles and gain information and skills to meet 
an objective. Role-playing games work in a similar way, except you play the role 
of a character, such as a knight or wizard, as you journey on an adventure. Another 
genre of long-play games includes simulators, such as those where you build a city 
and manage a complex set of urban factors. Strategy games focus on critical think-
ing to solve problems, often using military tactics. Sports games also fall into the 
­category of long-play games because they can involve sophisticated rules. These 
games emulate a sport such as football or soccer, including teams and strategy.
Media-Editing Software
If you acquire digital media such as music, video, and image files, you often need 
to edit it to suit your purposes. For example, suppose you want to make a short 
video demonstrating how to make sushi. You could use a digital video camera to 
record yourself making the sushi, select a music file to play at the beginning of the 
video, and take photos of the finished product to display at end of the video. To fine-
tune each component, you use graphics software to correct any flaws in the photos, 
music-editing software to play only a short segment of a song, and video-editing 
software to edit the video recording and produce it with the photos and music.
Graphics Software
You use graphics software such as Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop, and 
CorelDRAW to create, edit, and print graphics, including pictures, drawings, pho-
tographs, icons, and other images. The three major types of graphics software are 
paint, photo-editing, and drawing software. Paint software such as Microsoft Paint 
provides tools for painting the screen, which involves manipulating pixels by filling 
them with color. If you need to create a graphic on a Web page, for example, or any 
other object displayed on a computer screen, you can use paint software.
Video Game Industry
If you like to play video games, you have probably already considered a career in the video game industry, 
which continues to grow and lead to other types of technology fields in its application of cutting-edge 
research and software design techniques. A highly desirable job in the video game industry is that of game 
designer, the person who conceives of a game concept and then manages a development team to create 
the game according to the designer’s vision. You generally need to work up to the position of game designer 
by performing well in other industry jobs. These jobs include video game programmer, who writes the code 
that makes games run; animator, who designs and creates the animated graphics that make video games 
so engaging; and writer, who writes the story of the game, scripts to manage the action, and dialog for the 
characters. Besides technical and creative skills, you also need to work well in teams, stay informed about 
changes in a fast-moving field, and motivate yourself to learn about the software tools other video game 
professionals use to develop games and other entertainment software.

Basic photo-editing software includes features for improving digital photos by 
adjusting brightness and contrast and cropping out parts of the photo. Photo Gallery,

The easiest way to edit a photo in Photo Gallery is to display the photo and then 
click the Auto adjust button on the Edit tab. The Auto adjust tool selects the best set-
tings for the photo, including brightness, contrast, and color. If the photo includes 
one or more people with red eye, where they appear to have red eyes due to an effect 
caused by flash photography, you can click the Red eye button to remove this flaw. 
You can also select an option in the Effects group to apply color effects, such as 
brown tones that make a photo look antique.
More sophisticated photo-editing applications such as Adobe Photoshop apply 
advanced effects to photos, give you precise control over color, and let you crop 
irregularly shaped objects, such as those with curves and waves.
Unlike paint software, drawing software approaches a graphic as a set of geo-
metric objects, including lines and closed shapes. Because of this approach, graphics 
created with drawing software can be resized without reducing the quality of the 
image, which is not the case with paint software. 3-D graphics software also uses 
mathematics to represent 3-D objects and allows users to rotate and view them from 
many angles. A special type of 3-D graphics software is computer-aided design 
(CAD) software, which professional designers use to create models of products, 
buildings, and other objects; engineering and technical drawings; and blueprints for 
architectural projects.
Music-Editing Software
Music-editing applications such as Apple Garage Band, Music Maker Jam, and 
Finale are designed for people who want to record and edit their own music. You 
can use these applications to compose and record songs; change the volume, speed, 
and sound quality of recordings; add sound effects; and mix voices and instruments.

Some music-editing applications, including Music Maker Jam, provide parts of 
songs, called loops, from various genres. To compose a song, you would complete 
the following steps:
	 1.	 Select a loop from a genre such as Rock or Jazz.
	 2.	 Add instruments, other loops, and sound effects to create a more complete 
sound.
	 3.	 Adjust the volume levels of individual instruments to emphasize the guitar or 
the vocals, for example.
	 4.	 Save the composition to play on your computer.
Video-Editing Software
When you use video-editing software such as Windows Movie Maker, Apple iMovie, 
or Camtasia Studio, you work with video segments called clips. You arrange the 
clips in sequence on a timeline or storyboard, add transitions between clips, insert 
titles, and zoom in and out to direct the viewer’s attention. Figure 8–16 shows a 
video being created in Windows Movie Maker, which is a basic video editor you can

Using Software Tools
Utility programs are tools you use to maintain your data files, software, and hard-
ware. File utilities include software that helps you manage files, convert files from 
one format to another, and thoroughly delete files. Disk management utilities 
include software that helps the operating system store files efficiently on a disk and 
removes unnecessary files. Software utilities include software updating tools, virus 
and other malware scanners, and system monitors.
File Compression Software
File compression software is a type of file utility that reduces the size of a file by 
removing redundant data. You compress files before attaching them to an e-mail 
message, for example, so they can be transferred more quickly. When you receive 
a compressed file, you use the file compression software again to expand the file to 
its original size. Although operating systems provide file compression software, you 
can install separate utilities that perform the same tasks and include additional fea-
tures such as encrypting the compressed files for extra security. Figure 8–17 shows 
WinZip, a popular file compression utility, for iOS.

lesson 8  Software Usage 	
Mod1-235 
File compression software determines which redundant data to remove accord-
ing to sophisticated algorithms, which are sets of rules a program follows in cal-
culations or other problem-solving steps. The algorithm for compressing a text file 
identifies patterns in the text, including certain characters or words that often appear 
together, such as “th” or “is the.” The file compression software keeps track of this 
pattern in a log, and substitutes the text for a code. For example, instead of storing 
the words “is the” 25 times in a file, the software uses “1” as the code for “is the,” 
which stores only one character instead of six. When the file is extracted, the soft-
ware reverses the operation and substitutes “is the” for each code of “1.” This type of 
compression is called lossless compression because it reconstructs the original file 
without losing any data. Lossless file compression methods can reduce text files by 
50 percent or more.
Files containing graphics or music do not include much redundant data, so file 
compression software does not use this kind of algorithm for compressing media 
files. Instead, it uses a lossy compression method, which removes data identified as 
unnecessary in the file. For example, suppose you want to compress a graphic with a 
white background. Although the background seems to be the same shade of white at 
normal size, when you use graphics-editing software to zoom into the background, 
you’ll see that each pixel is a slightly different shade of white. Instead of retaining 
thousands of shades of white, file compression software changes the color value of 
some pixels so the background is composed of only hundreds or dozens of shades, 
reducing the size of the file significantly. However, when you extract the graphic, 
the lost colors are not restored, meaning the graphic is not exactly the same as the 
original file because some data has been lost. You are unlikely to notice the differ-
ence in a graphics file, which is why these programs use lossy compression methods 
for graphics.
Disk Management Software
You use disk management software to maintain your hard disk by keeping it free 
of problems that could prevent you from accessing your data. The failure of a hard 
disk can be an inconvenience if you have backups of your data, and a disaster if you 
don’t. Disk management software helps you prevent disk failure from occurring in 
the first place by removing corrupted files and unnecessary files, blocking access to 
damaged parts of the disk, and arranging data for efficient retrieval.
You should use three disk management utilities regularly. One is a disk cleaner, 
which identifies files you can safely delete to free up disk space. Another is a 
disk scanner, or error-checking tool, which scans for disk errors, such as parts of 
corrupted files and damaged sections on the disk, and then repairs them. The third 
tool is a defragmenter, which can optimize the way files are stored on the disk. 
Desktop operating systems provide these utilities by default; you can download and 
install apps that perform these tasks on mobile operating systems.
In addition to cleaning, scanning, and defragmenting a disk, you can com-
press it, which is similar to compressing files. A disk compression utility increases 
the amount of data you can store on a hard disk by compressing all of its files. 
Instead of selecting files to compress, as you do with a file compression utility, a 
disk compression utility works in the background whenever you store files on the 
hard disk.
In Windows 8, the disk cleaner utility is called Disk Cleanup, which you use 
in Step-by-Step 8.2. When you start Disk Cleanup, it searches your hard disk 
for unnecessary files, such as temporary Internet files and those in your Recycle 
Bin, and then lists the types of files. You can select each type of file to learn its 
purpose and determine whether you want to permanently delete those files from 
your hard disk.
Quick Tip
Recall from Lesson 2 that you 
maintain system and application 
software through software 
updates, preferably those that 
are set to update automatically.

To understand how an error-checking tool and a defragmenter work, recall that 
the surface of a hard disk contains concentric circles called tracks. Tracks are divided 
into blocks of 512 bytes, and each block is called a sector of the disk. To save a file 
on a disk, the operating system assigns the file to one or more sectors. Each part of 
a file stored in a sector is called a cluster of data. Because most files are larger than 
512 bytes (the size of one sector), the data in a file is usually divided among several 
clusters. A file system error known as a lost cluster occurs if the operating system 
loses track of which clusters contain the data that belong to a particular file. An 
error-checking tool identifies file system errors and can repair them if necessary. In 
addition, it can scan for and repair physical errors on the hard disk itself, including 
bad sectors, which are areas of the disk that do not record data reliably.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Contiguous ﬁle
Hard disk sector
Fragmented ﬁle
After correcting any errors on your hard disk, you can run a defragmenter 
to improve the disk’s performance so that applications start and files open more 
quickly. (Most operating systems run a defragmenter according to a schedule, so 
you can also wait and let the operating system start the defragmenter for you.) 
When an operating system breaks a file into clusters, it attempts to place the data 
in adjoining sectors, and usually does so successfully on a relatively new hard 
disk. When you delete a file, the operating system frees the sectors that contained 
the file’s data. The next time you save a file, the operating system searches for the 
first available sector, stores a cluster of data, and then searches for the next avail-
able sector, which might not be next to the first one. The more files you save and 
delete, the more scattered the clusters for a file become. A disk that contains files 
whose clusters are not contiguous, or next to each other, is said to be fragmented. 
See Figure 8–20.
Figure 8–20  Fragmented disk
The more fragmented the disk, the longer the operating system takes to 
retrieve the file, and the more likely you are to have problems with the file. When 
an application tries to access a file on a fragmented disk, file retrieval takes lon-
ger than necessary because the application must locate clusters that aren’t adjacent. 
Defragmenting rearranges the clusters on the disk so each file’s clusters are adjacent 
to one another. When a disk is in this state, it is said to be optimized.
In Step-by-Step 8.3, you use the Windows 8 disk scanner utility, called the Error-
checking tool, to scan your disk for errors. You also learn how to start the Optimize 
Drives tool, the defragmenter in Windows 8, and examine its schedule. By default, 
Optimize Drives is set to check your hard disk once a week and then defragment it 
if it’s fragmented. Because defragmenting a hard disk can take a long time and you 
must close all applications, including those in the background, before defragment-
ing, you won’t defragment in the following steps. To perform the following steps, 
you must be using an Administrator account. If you are not using an Administrator 
account, read but do not perform the steps.

Malware and Antivirus Software
When you connect to the Internet, receive an e-mail message, or share your com-
puter or files with others, your computer is vulnerable to harm from people who 
might attempt to access confidential information or damage your files. They can 
do so through malware, which is short for malicious software. Malware includes 
computer viruses, worms, Trojans, bots, and spyware. By copying itself and trig-
gering computer code, a virus can infect your computer and damage your files 
and system settings. Viruses are often transmitted through e-mail attachments or 
downloaded files, but they don’t spread until you open the infected attachment 
or file.
In contrast, a worm is harmful computer code that spreads without your inter-
action. A worm slips from one network connection to another, replicating itself on 
computers. As it does, a worm consumes network resources, overwhelming comput-
ers until they become slow or unresponsive.
Another type of malware is a Trojan, also called a Trojan horse, which is 
malware that hides inside another program, such as a browser toolbar you down-
load from the Web. When you install the toolbar, the Trojan infects the operating 
system, allowing a hacker to access your computer. If attackers access your sys-
tem through a Trojan, they might install a bot, short for robot, which is a program 
that runs repetitive tasks. Bots can control your computer without your knowledge 
to perform illegal activities such as sending massive amounts of spam (electronic 
junk mail).
Spyware can also install itself or run on your computer without your consent 
or control. As its name suggests, spyware monitors your computing actions, usually 
while you are online, to collect information about you. Sometimes, spyware passes 
information about your Web browsing habits to advertisers, who use it to improve 
their products or Web sites. Other times, a special type of spyware called adware 
changes your browser settings to open pop-up ads, which are windows that appear 
while you are viewing a Web page and advertise a product or service. Pop-up ads 
interrupt your online activities and can be difficult to close; they can also be vehicles 
for additional spyware or other types of malware.
Common symptoms of malware are when your computer runs much slower than 
normal, messages appear unexpectedly, programs start or close on their own, or the 
operating system shuts down suddenly.
To defend against malware, you should install and run antivirus software on 
your computer, and then keep it up to date because new malware is released fre-
quently. Antivirus software blocks potential malware, scans your computer, and 
safely removes viruses, worms, Trojans, and bots. Some antivirus software also 
scans for spyware. Table 8–1 lists some popular antivirus software for Windows, 
Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. Mobile operating systems are well protected against 
malware because they exclusively use online stores to distribute apps, and developers  
can tightly control the software offered at online stores.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
You use productivity applications to perform work and other 
activities effectively. Productivity applications are often bun-
dled together in a software suite.
n 
You use word-processing software to produce written docu-
ments such as reports, letters, memos, research papers, and 
flyers. Features in word-processing software help you reduce 
the number of errors in a document and improve the quality of 
your writing. They also provide formatting features so you can 
make documents look professional and appealing and include 
collaboration features for working with other users.
n 
Desktop publishing software is similar to word-processing 
software because you use it to arrange text and graphics on a 
page. In addition, it includes tools for producing and printing 
typographic-quality documents and for sending files to a com-
mercial printer.
n 
You use presentation software to organize and present text, 
graphics, and other media as a slide show. Layouts in presen-
tation software guide you to arrange text and graphics on a 
slide. Presentation software also includes features to engage 
the audience and clarify ideas during a slide show, such as slide 
transitions and animations.
n 
You use spreadsheet software to organize numeric data so that 
you can calculate, analyze, interpret, and present it. You insert 
a formula to display the results of a calculation. If you use cell 
references in a formula, recalculation is automatic when data 
changes. The ability to update automatically makes spreadsheets 
especially useful when you need to perform what-if analysis.
n 
To help you visualize numeric data, spreadsheet software 
includes tools for creating charts (also called graphs). Charts 
show trends or relationships in data that you might not notice 
when examining columns or rows of numbers.
n 
You use database software to enter, organize, update, retrieve, 
and produce reports on the electronic data in a database. All of 
the data in a database is stored in one or more tables, which are 
composed of rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets. Each 
column in the table represents a field and each row represents 
a record.
n 
A database file can contain objects including tables, forms, 
queries, and reports. You use a form to enter data into a table. 
You use a query to request specific information that meets set 
criteria from the database. A report provides data as a format-
ted printout or display.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
n 
Both spreadsheets and databases are designed for organiz-
ing, managing, and tracking data that is stored in columns and 
rows. If your focus is on using numerical data to make calcula-
tions or a quick analysis, create a spreadsheet. If your focus is 
on storing other types of data for the long term and manipulat-
ing it efficiently, create a database.
n 
Entertainment software includes applications that let you 
download and listen to music or the radio, watch movies and 
television shows, and play games.
n 
You use media-editing software to edit digital media such as 
photos and other pictures, music, and videos.
n 
You use graphics software to create, edit, and print graphics, 
including pictures, drawings, photographs, clip art, icons, and 
other images. The three major types of graphics software are 
paint, photo-editing, and drawing software.
n 
Music-editing applications are designed for people who want 
to record and edit their own music. Video-editing applications 
are designed for people who want to create and edit videos. You 
import and then organize video clips, music clips, and other 
media clips, and then publish them together in one video file.
n 
Utility programs are tools you use to maintain your data 
files, software, and hardware. File utilities include software 
that helps you manage files, convert files from one format to 
another, and thoroughly delete files. Disk management utili-
ties include software that helps the operating system store files 
efficiently on a disk and removes unnecessary files.
n 
To defend against malware, you should install and run antivirus 
software on your computer, and then keep it up to date because 
new malware is released frequently. Antivirus software blocks 
potential malware, scans your computer, and safely removes 
viruses, worms, Trojans, and bots. Some antivirus software 
also scans for spyware.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
In this lesson, you learn how to solve computer problems by following common 
troubleshooting steps, and then apply those steps to software and hardware prob-
lems. You use troubleshooting tools to identify and solve operating system and appli-
cation software problems, and learn about resources for troubleshooting problems 
with computer components and peripheral devices.
Approaches to Troubleshooting
Suppose you are using your computer to complete a major project and the deadline 
is fast approaching. As you work on the project, you’re creating content in word-
processing, spreadsheet, and graphics applications, and then combining the content 
into a presentation. As you copy and paste a chart onto the last slide, the presenta-
tion application closes suddenly. When you open the application again, a message 
appears indicating that the presentation you were working on is corrupt and cannot 
be recovered. Now what do you do?
If you are experiencing a computer problem like this example, you need to trou-
bleshoot to solve the problem. Troubleshooting means to take a logical, systematic 
approach to identify the source or cause of the problem, and then apply a solution so 
that the computer is working normally again. Troubleshooting typically involves the 
following four steps:
	 1.	 Define the problem: Describe the trouble that you are having, being as specific 
as possible. For example, to define the presentation problem, you should note 
the name and version of the presentation application, the type of content you 
were trying to paste onto a slide, and the source of that content. Also note the 
other applications you were running at the time the problem occurred, and any 
system tasks the computer might have been running in the background.
	 2.	 Identify possible causes: Consider obvious causes first, such as the original 
presentation file being damaged. Next, determine the last time you successfully 
performed the same steps with the software. Have you installed or uninstalled 
any software since then? If so, those actions are also possible causes.
	 3.	 Determine the most likely cause: Work through a process of elimination to 
determine the most likely cause. Test each cause. For example, does the pre-
sentation software close unexpectedly each time you try to paste a chart from 
the spreadsheet software? If not, eliminate pasting a chart as the cause of the 
problem. If the presentation software does close each time, however, you have 
found the most likely cause.
	 4.	 Apply solutions: As you test causes, keep track of possible solutions, and then 
apply each solution systematically. If pasting a chart from a spreadsheet appli-
cation caused the problem, does updating one of the applications solve the 
problem? What about updating both applications? Try your task again to con-
firm that the solution restores the software to a reliable working state.
When you define the problem in Step 1 of the troubleshooting steps, you deter-
mine whether you are trying to solve a software or hardware problem. If the problem 
seems to involve only applications or the operating system, troubleshoot the soft-
ware. If the problem occurs as the computer starts, troubleshoot the operating system 
first. For other computer problems and those where software troubleshooting does 
not solve the problem, troubleshoot the hardware and peripheral devices.

Mod1-249 
Getting Help from Online Resources
When you have any type of computer problem, you can find valuable troubleshooting 
information on the Web. The best sources are knowledge bases and online forums. 
A knowledge base is a collection of articles, videos, and other sources containing 
information about a product or topic. Software developers and hardware manufactur-
ers provide knowledge bases to their users to help them solve problems. Typically, 
a technical support professional writes a knowledge base article to answer common 
questions or to explain how to work around a known flaw in the software. Knowledge 
base articles are often part of or linked to software Help topics. They are also ­available 
online at the support Web site of a software developer or hardware manufacturer. For 
example, to access the Microsoft knowledge base, you visit support.microsoft.com/kb. 
To access the Apple knowledge base, you visit kbase.info.apple.com. On the knowl-
edge base Web site, you search for a topic by keyword the same way you search for 
any information on the Internet. Operating system knowledge bases include informa-
tion about third-party software as well as their own software.
An online forum is a Web site where people conduct conversations by posting 
messages about a specific topic. Software developers and hardware manufacturers 
often host online forums where users can post questions or report problems they are 
having with the product. Other users or technical support people working for the 
software developer or hardware manufacturer answer the questions or help to trou-
bleshoot the problem. The original message and all the responses to it are grouped 
together sequentially by topic. This group of related messages is called a thread. 
Threads are saved in an archive that you can search to determine if your problem has 
already been solved before you post a new message.
The Apple online forum is called the Apple Support Communities, which you 
can access from the Apple Web site. In Windows Help and Support, you can click 
the Microsoft Community website link to display the online forum for Microsoft 
software. See Figure 9–1.

The following sections describe other solutions you can try when you are trou-
bleshooting more specific software problems.
Using Troubleshooting Tools
Operating systems include diagnostic tools that help you troubleshoot software 
problems, including those with the operating system itself. If a Windows application 
starts, but runs slowly or fails to respond to your commands, you can troubleshoot 
the problem with Task Manager, which you used in Lesson 2. Mac OS X includes 
a similar tool called Activity Monitor. You can also troubleshoot Windows software 
problems using the Action Center, a Control Panel tool that helps you manage secu-
rity and maintenance settings.
Managing Application Resources
You have already learned to use Task Manager to track the system resources 
(­including CPU and memory) that applications, background processes, and Windows 
processes consume. You can also use this information to troubleshoot application 
problems. For example, suppose five applications are open and running on your 
computer, including Internet Explorer, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, 
Microsoft Word, and File Explorer (shown as “Windows Explorer”). As you edit 
and format text in Word, the changes are very slow to appear in the document. To 
find the possible cause of this problem, open Task Manager, which might appear as 
in Figure 9–2, which shows the resource usage of the running applications on the 
Processes tab.

Five applications plus

currently running
Figure 9–2  Task Manager showing six running applications
Total memory is 96%, which is very high, indicating that the open applications 
are using almost all of the available RAM. To free RAM for Word, close the appli-
cation using the most RAM, which is Internet Explorer in this case. If Word is still 
running slowly, close the other applications until Word can access the RAM it needs 
to work more efficiently.
On a computer running Mac OS X, you use Activity Monitor to manage appli-
cation resources. Open the Applications folder, open the Utilities folder, and then 
double-click Activity Monitor to display the Activity Monitor window, which is 
similar to the Task Manager window. Troubleshoot a slow application the same way: 
determine how much total memory is being used, and then close applications if the 
total memory is close to 100 percent.
In Windows, you also use Task Manager to close an application that does not 
respond to any of your actions, including clicking the Close button (or an equiva-
lent command) to close the application. In such a case, you can open Task Manager 
and then check the Status column, which might display a status of “Not respond-
ing.” Select the unresponsive application, and then click the End task button to close 
the application. Unfortunately, with this method, you lose any work you completed 
since the last time you saved the open files in the application.
Using Problem-Reporting Tools
Operating systems also keep track of software errors, often in logs, which are text 
files stored in a system folder. When you have a serious software problem, such 
as an application closing without warning, Mac OS X, iOS, and Windows display 
a dialog box asking if you want to send a problem report to Apple or Microsoft. 
A problem report is a copy of the error data, which includes details about the prob-
lem, such as the name and version of the application, when the error occurred, and 
technical information about the state of the system at that time. If you agree to send 
a problem report, the operating system submits the information to help diagnose or 
solve the problem. These solutions are often provided to you in software updates 
or patches.

Windows also checks for solutions when an application fails to respond or 
closes unexpectedly. In those situations, a dialog box might open, similar to the one 
in Figure 9–3, indicating that Windows is checking for a solution to the problem.

If your computer is connected to the Internet, Windows can search a secure part 
of the Microsoft Web site for similar problems that other users have reported, and then 
check for a solution. Solutions that Microsoft checks for include a link to a Help article, 
a file to download, or steps to perform. When a solution is available, Microsoft sends 
a message to the Action Center and displays a Solve PC issues ScreenTip when you 
point to the Action Center icon in the notification area of the taskbar. See Figure 9–4.

You can click the Action Center icon and then click Open Action Center to open 
the Action Center window and access the solution Windows found, which you do 
in Step-by-Step 9.1. In addition to checking for solutions, you can use the Action 
Center to review messages regarding problem reports, which Windows archives by 
default, and to determine whether the solution applies to other problems.

Using Automated Troubleshooters
For some software and hardware problems, operating systems offer automated 
troubleshooters, which are dialog boxes or wizards that check settings and then 
change them as necessary so you can perform certain tasks. For example, you can 
use the Connection Doctor on a Mac to have Mac OS X check your Internet and 
e-mail ­connection settings and then repair them if necessary. Windows includes simi-
lar troubleshooters. These tools are often the best way to solve specific problems such 
as complications from a software updating tool and program compatibility issues.
To understand how an automated troubleshooter resolves complications from 
software updates, you need to know how a software updating tool works. It commu-
nicates with a server according to a schedule to see if the server has updates for the 
software. If it does, the updating tool downloads the necessary files, and then refers 
to a script to install the files in the correct locations on the computer. Sometimes, the 
update files or the script are lost or damaged before the download or update is com-
pleted. A running process or other obstacle might also prevent the updating tool from 
installing the files in the correct locations. The easiest way to solve these problems 
is to repeat the update manually. However, if the update is still unsuccessful, you can 
often run an automated troubleshooter, which checks for problems at each step of the 
updating process and then repairs them.
Another problem automated troubleshooters can solve involves software com-
patibility. Software is developed to run under specific versions of an operating ­system 
so that it follows the rules of the file system, knows how to request services from the 
operating system, and can find drivers and other resources it needs to operate cor-
rectly. If your computer is running the most recent version of Windows, for example, 
and you install an application written for an earlier version, such as Windows Vista 
or Windows XP, the application might run poorly or not run at all. The same is true 
for software written for Mac OS X. In both operating systems, the older software is 
considered incompatible with the up-to-date operating system.
Because incompatible applications can actually damage files on a Mac, 
Mac OS X moves incompatible software to a restricted folder when you upgrade the 
operating system. It also prevents the application from opening, and advises you to 
visit the Apple App Store for a more recent compatible version.
Above and Beyond
If you are having trouble com-
pleting a task in Windows, you 
can use a troubleshooter called 
the Problem Steps Recorder to 
record the steps you perform 
on a computer. The Problem 
Steps Recorder captures and 
saves the screen image each 
time you click, and includes a 
text description of where you 
clicked. As part of the process, 
you can save the captured 
images and text in a zipped file 
and send it to a support profes-
sional or someone else helping 
you troubleshoot a computer 
problem. To start the Problem 
Steps Recorder troubleshooter, 
open the Control Panel, search 
for “problem steps,” and then 
click Record steps to reproduce 
a problem in the search results.

For most applications, Windows takes a different approach and provides a trou-
bleshooter you can use to select and test compatibility settings that might fix the 
problems in the older application. However, you should not use the troubleshooter 
with older antivirus applications, disk utilities, or other system software because the 
troubleshooter might remove data or create a security risk. In those cases, you should 
contact the software developer or visit the Windows Store for the most recent version 
of the software.
In Step-by-Step 9.2, you use two troubleshooting wizards designed to resolve 
problems with potentially incompatible applications and with Windows Update.

Removing Malware
Recall from Lesson 8 that malware such as viruses and spyware can infect your com-
puter any time you visit a Web site or open an e-mail attachment. Because malware 
can download, install, and run on your computer without your knowledge or consent, 
it’s often difficult to know if it is infecting your computer.
Your best protection against malware is to use the current version of your anti-
virus and antispyware software to scan e-mail messages, attachments, and other files 
on your computer for viruses, worms, and other types of malware. Antivirus software 
locates a virus by comparing identifying characteristics of the files on your computer 
to the characteristics of a list of known viruses, which are called virus ­definitions. 
When it finds malware, antivirus software notifies you and takes action to protect 
your computer from harm. Because new malware is being released daily, you need to 
keep the virus definitions up to date through the antivirus software’s update feature. 
The same is true of antispyware software, though it refers to a list of known spyware 
as spyware definitions.

Windows and Mac OS X include antivirus software among their operating sys-
tem tools, though you can install antivirus software from other developers (called 
third-party applications) such as Norton Antivirus and McAfee Antivirus. The antivi-
rus software built into Mac OS X is called XProtect, which scans downloaded files for 
malware. As added protection, Mac OS X includes Gatekeeper, which allows you to 
restrict your Mac to running apps only from the Apple App Store. Using apps exclu-
sively from the App Store is the primary way Mac OS X protects a computer from 
malware. Windows computers come with Windows Defender, which was introduced 
in Project 3 of Lesson 8. On either type of computer, if you install a third-party anti-
virus application, you should disable XProtect or Windows Defender because mul-
tiple antivirus applications running simultaneously can conflict with each other. Only 
one antivirus application should be running on your computer at any time.
In Step-by-Step 9.3, you use the Action Center to check whether antivirus soft-
ware other than Windows Defender is running on your computer. If it’s not, you can 
use Windows Defender to scan for both viruses and spyware. (If an application scans 
for both viruses and spyware, it is sometimes called an antimalware application.) 
You can run a quick scan, a full-system scan, or a custom scan. A quick scan checks 
the locations on your computer that viruses and spyware are most likely to infect. 
With a custom scan, you select the locations you want Windows Defender to check. 
In the following steps, you perform a quick scan.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
If antivirus or antispyware software finds suspicious files when it scans your 
computer, it usually places them in quarantine, which means it moves the files 
to another location on your computer to safely segregate them from other files. 
Quarantined files cannot run, so they cannot harm your computer. Most antivirus and 
antispyware software gives you the option of deleting or restoring quarantined files. 
In case the quarantined files are safe files your computer needs, keep the files in 
quarantine for a few days. If you don’t have any computer problems since the files 
were quarantined, you can remove them to free disk space. If you continue to have 
computer problems, research the filenames of the quarantined files online to deter-
mine whether they are safe to restore.
Using Safe Mode
If the operating system doesn’t start normally when you turn on your computer, it 
might restart in Safe mode so you can resolve or troubleshoot the startup problem. 
Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for operating systems that starts your com-
puter with only basic services and functionality. If the computer doesn’t automati-
cally restart in Safe mode, you can start in Safe mode manually. On a Mac, you start 
in Safe mode by performing the following steps:
	 1.	 Turn on or restart the computer while you are pressing and holding the Shift key.
	 2.	 Hold the Shift key until the Finder loads completely.
On a Windows computer, you start in Safe mode by performing the following 
steps:
	 1.	 Display the Charms bar, click the Settings charm, and then click Change PC 
settings to display the PC settings screen.
	 2.	 Click Update and recovery in the left pane to display options for updating and 
recovering the operating system, and then click the Recovery category in the 
left pane.
	 3.	 In the Advanced startup section in the right pane, click the Restart now button 
to display the Choose an option screen.
	 4.	 Click the Troubleshoot button to display the Troubleshoot screen, and then 
click Advanced options to display the Advanced options screen.
	 5.	 Click the Startup Settings button to display the Startup Settings screen.
	 6.	 Click the Restart button to restart the computer and display the Startup Settings 
screen instead of the usual screen that appears when you start the computer.
	 7.	 Press the 4 key to select Enable Safe Mode, and then enter your password if 
prompted to display the desktop in Safe mode, shown in Figure 9–13. Windows 
Help and Support opens to display the Safe mode Help topic in case you need 
help with Safe mode.

Because Safe mode uses only the most basic settings and drivers, the screen 
appears in its lowest resolution with no background image, the computer is not con-
nected to the Internet, and peripheral devices such as speakers are disabled. “Safe 
Mode” also appears in the four corners of the screen to indicate that Windows is in 
Safe mode. Mac OS X displays a similar basic screen when in Safe mode.
Often, starting in Safe mode alone resolves a startup problem, which might be 
the result of a background program not loading correctly. Try restarting the computer 
immediately after starting in Safe mode to see if the problem recurs.
If the problem recurs in normal mode but not in Safe mode, you can elimi-
nate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. Next, start each 
application you normally use to see if it opens in Safe mode. On a Windows com-
puter, start Task Manager and then click the Startup tab to display a list of software 
that starts and runs in the background after Windows loads. Start as many of these 
programs as possible. If an application does not open in Safe mode, reinstall it to 
see if that solves the problem.
If you have recently installed software on a Windows computer, the software 
might not be compatible with your version of Windows or might introduce other 
problems that are difficult to track. You can restore your computer to an earlier point 
using the System Restore feature, a system utility that helps you restore system files 
to an earlier state, usually one during which the startup problem did not occur. You 
use System Restore to undo system changes without affecting your data files.
If you have recently installed new hardware, the driver might be incompat-
ible with the operating system on your computer. Try uninstalling the hardware 
and restarting the computer. If it starts normally, the new hardware was most likely 
the cause of the problem. Check the device manufacturer’s Web site to make sure 
the device is compatible with your version of your operating system. If it is, rein-
stall the device, and then use the operating system’s update tool, such as Windows 
Update, to check for and install the most recent driver.
On a Mac, a startup problem is often caused by a damaged file Mac OS X needs 
to start properly. Run the Disk Utility to find and repair file problems.
After resolving a problem in Safe mode, you must restart your computer to 
return to normal operations.

Firefox is a popular browser that 
you can start in Safe mode to 
troubleshoot problems ­visiting

iTunes is running erratically, 
you can start it in Safe mode to

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Troubleshooting Hardware
Problems with a computer’s internal hardware affect the computer’s ability to start 
and run, so they are major problems that need to be addressed as soon as you notice 
them. Symptoms of internal hardware trouble include the following:
n 
Beeps during POST—Recall that when you start a computer, it performs the 
power-on self test (POST) to check critical system components and make sure 
they are running properly. These components include the processor, RAM, and 
the video card. Some computers beep if these components are working normally 
or do not beep at all. Other computers flash lights on the keyboard instead of 
using beeps. Search the computer manufacturer’s Web site to learn what these 
codes or their absence signal. An error during POST usually means one of the 
critical system components is damaged or failing and needs to be replaced. After 
a POST error, the operating system might start in Safe mode or display a message 
indicating you should start in Safe mode so you can troubleshoot the problem.
n 
Hard drive makes unusual sounds—If you use your computer often, you 
are  probably aware of the normal sounds it makes as it saves files on the 
hard  drive, which might include whirring or spinning sounds. If a mechani-
cal hard drive makes an unusual sound, such as grinding, clicking, or prolonged 
spinning, it might have a problem that will eventually cause it to fail. If it sud-
denly takes a long time to save files, your hard drive is on the brink of failure. 
Back up your data (see Lesson 10 for instructions), use a disk-checking utility to 
scan the drive for errors, and plan to replace the drive soon.
n 
Display screen is blank, garbled, or includes blank areas—These are all symp-
toms of a damaged video card, which can be affected by power surges. A power 
surge or spike is a boost to the electrical charge that powers the computer, and 
can occur during lightning storms, power outages, short circuits, and other dis-
ruptions to a computer’s power source. Power surges can also damage hard 
drives and RAM. You can test for video card failure by attaching a different 
monitor to your computer. If the new monitor does not display information cor-
rectly, replace the video card.
n 
Frequent software crashes, unusual messages, or deteriorating performance—If 
the operating system crashes or displays messages that don’t seem to relate to 
your current activities, suspect a problem with RAM. Also suspect RAM failure if 
the computer performs a task normally shortly after starting, but takes much more 
time to perform the same task later in the session. Use tools such as Task Manager 
to track how much memory is installed on the computer. If the tool reports less 
RAM than was originally installed, you need to replace a memory module.
n 
Computer does not start at all—If the computer does not even complete POST 
or fails shortly after POST, the power supply, processor, or motherboard might 
need to be replaced. Considering that the processor is the most expensive com-
ponent in your computer, you might consider replacing the entire computer in 
this case.
All of the troubleshooting methods you can use with software also apply to 
hardware, including operating system options such as troubleshooters, Safe mode, 
knowledge base articles, and online forums. In addition, on a Windows computer, 
you can use Device Manager to check the status of hardware, uninstall and reinstall 
drivers, disable and enable the device, and scan for hardware changes. Lesson 5 
includes a complete list of troubleshooting steps to use with Device Manager.
On a Mac, you troubleshoot hardware problems using the Apple Hardware Test, 
which automatically tests system components and then displays the test results. You 
can look up the error codes and messages displayed in the results by accessing the 
Apple knowledge base. To start the Apple Hardware Test, press and hold the D key 
as the Mac starts.

Troubleshooting Firmware
Computer hardware manufacturers occasionally release updates to firmware, the 
software that permanently resides on a chip or other hardware component to control 
a device. Updates to firmware usually enhance features or fix bugs, so you should 
consider firmware updates when troubleshooting hardware problems, especially 
those involving smartphones and tablets, which receive firmware updates more fre-
quently than other types of computers.
To find out about firmware updates, register a computer or device with the 
manufacturer, who will alert you, usually by e-mail, when the firmware needs to be 
updated. You can also find out about firmware updates by visiting the manufacturer’s 
Web site and online forums.
You update the firmware for a computer or device by connecting to the 
Internet and then selecting an option on the device itself for updating the firmware. 
Before applying a firmware update, make sure the update is for the exact model 
of your computer or device. Check the model number on the device itself or in its 
documentation and apply a firmware update only if it is intended for your model. 
When you update firmware, the old firmware is removed completely. If the new 
firmware is not compatible with your computer or device, it will not work at all 
with the new firmware.
Checking Cables and Connections
Before replacing any internal components or the computer itself, follow the trouble-
shooting steps to try the easiest fixes on your own. For example, if your computer 
doesn’t start or stops running suddenly, check the power cords leading to your com-
puter, especially if you recently moved the computer or bumped it, which could have 
loosened connections. If the display screen is blank on a desktop computer, first 
make sure the cable from the monitor is securely attached to the system unit. If you 
are using a mobile computer, make sure the battery has enough charge to run the 
computer. As you are recharging the battery, check the power adapter cable and its 
connection to the device to make sure it is securely connected to the device and to 
the power outlet.
If you decide to work with a PC specialist to repair a computer, ask the specialist 
to check the internal cables and connections before replacing components. Because 
system components are connected to the internal circuitry and depend on each other 
for basic operations, reseating or reconnecting a component such as the CPU, ROM, 
or a memory module might solve a seemingly serious problem. See Figure 9–14.
1-4.2.1
Quick Tip
Applying a firmware update 
that makes it impossible to use 
a device is called bricking the 
device.

Troubleshooting Peripheral Devices
In some ways, problems with peripheral devices are easier to troubleshoot than 
problems with internal computer hardware because you can access the devices more 
easily. However, peripheral devices can experience a wider range of problems than 
internal components, so it can take longer to find the right solution. In general, check 
the following information as you troubleshoot any peripheral device:
n 
Cables and connections—As with internal components, make sure peripheral 
devices are properly and securely connected to your computer. The operating 
system might not recognize a device if it is loosely connected to a port on the 
computer.
n 
Compatibility—Determine whether the device is designed to run with the 
­version and operating system installed on your computer. Compatibility infor-
mation is included on the packaging of a device and on the Web site of a device 
manufacturer. If you are using the most recent version of Windows and try to 
install a device designed only for Windows XP and earlier, the device probably 
will not work correctly.
n 
Drivers—The operating system needs a compatible driver to interact with a 
peripheral device. Recall that in most cases, drivers are provided with operat-
ing systems and are updated as necessary. If a peripheral device is not working 
correctly, you can try updating the driver yourself from an optical disc provided 
with the device or from the manufacturer’s Web site.
n 
Firmware—To update firmware for a peripheral device, you typically connect 
the device to your computer, and then connect the computer to the Internet, if 
necessary. Visit the Web site of the device manufacturer, navigate to the support 
page for your device, check the model number, and then follow the instructions 
for updating the firmware.

Troubleshooting on the Job
Some of the most challenging and rewarding experiences in a career come from solving problems. You also 
increase your value to an employer if you have excellent troubleshooting skills. Defining a problem and 
gathering information about it can be effective, even for complex problems. Finding and applying possible 
solutions can demand a combination of technical knowledge and imagination. If you are running out of 
obvious solutions to a problem, try thinking creatively. Reconsider your definition of the ­problem—what 
seems like a hardware problem, for example, might actually be a software glitch. For critical ­problems, 
work with a group to brainstorm ideas. When you brainstorm, you generate as many ideas as you can 
­without pausing to critique or edit them. After you run out of ideas, you can narrow the ideas to only 
­practical ones. Continue to work with others to solve problems. Each person in the group can contribute 
knowledge and experience, which often leads to new and valuable insights.

Mod1-265 
Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Troubleshooting means to take a logical, systematic approach 
to identify the source or cause of the problem, and then apply a 
solution so that the computer is working normally again.
n 
Troubleshooting typically involves the following four steps: 
define the problem, identify possible causes, determine the 
most likely cause, and apply solutions.
n 
When you have any type of computer problem, you can find 
valuable troubleshooting information in knowledge bases and 
online forums. A knowledge base is a collection of articles, 
videos, and other sources containing information about a prod-
uct or topic. At an online forum, users and technical experts 
conduct conversations to solve computer problems.
n 
Common problems with software include not starting, not run-
ning, and causing problems with other software. These prob-
lems can be solved by reinstalling the software, restarting the 
computer, and updating the software.
n 
Operating systems include diagnostic tools that help you trou-
bleshoot software problems, including those with the operat-
ing system itself. These tools include Task Manager or Activity 
Monitor, problem reports, and automated troubleshooters.
n 
Operating systems keep track of software errors in logs, which 
are text files stored in a system folder. When you have a seri-
ous software problem, you can send a problem report to Apple 
or Microsoft. The problem report contains a copy of the error 
data, including details about the problem, such as the name and 
version of the application, when the error occurred, and techni-
cal information about the state of the system at that time.
n 
Solutions to Windows and application problems include links 
to Help articles, files to download, and steps to perform. When 
a solution is available, Microsoft sends a message to the Action 
Center on your computer so you can access the information.
n 
For some software and hardware problems, operating systems 
offer automated troubleshooters, which are tools that take you 
through a series of dialog boxes to check settings and then 
change them as necessary so you can perform certain tasks.
n 
Your best protection against malware is to use updated ver-
sions of antivirus and antispyware software to scan your com-
puter for malware and then remove it or quarantine it. This 
type of software locates malware by comparing identifying 
characteristics of the files on your computer to the characteris-
tics of known malware, which are called virus definitions and 
spyware definitions.
n 
If antivirus or antispyware software finds suspicious files when 
it scans your computer, it usually places them in quarantine, 
which means segregating the suspicious files from the rest of 
your file system. Quarantined files cannot run, so they cannot 
harm your computer.
n 
Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for operating systems 
that starts your computer with only basic services and func-
tionality. If the operating system doesn’t start normally when 
you turn on or restart your computer, it might start in Safe 
mode automatically. You can also start in Safe mode manually 
to resolve or troubleshoot the startup problem.
n 
Problems with a computer’s internal hardware affect the com-
puter’s ability to start and run, so they are major problems that 
need to be addressed as soon as you notice them. Symptoms of 
internal hardware trouble include beeps and flashing lights dur-
ing POST, unusual sounds from the hard drive, blank areas on 
the display screen, frequent crashes, and failure to start.
n 
For hardware problems involving smartphones and tablets, 
check the manufacturer’s Web site for firmware updates, which 
are often issued to fix bugs. The firmware in peripheral devices 
might also need to be updated to resolve compatibility errors.
n 
To troubleshoot problems with peripheral devices, start by 
checking cables and connections to make sure the device is 
properly and securely connected to your computer. Determine 
whether the driver is compatible with your operating system 
and that you have the most recent driver installed.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
In this lesson, you learn about backing up and restoring files. You examine the types 
of backups and explore your options for how to create and where to store backups. 
You investigate two methods for backing up files, and learn the importance of fol-
lowing a backup plan. Besides using backups to protect data, you also learn about 
ways to protect computer hardware.
Backing Up and Restoring Files
If you have ever inadvertently deleted a file or folder, overwritten a version of a 
file you meant to save, or lost data after a hard drive crashed or a virus corrupted 
files, you know how important it is to back up your computer files. A backup is a 
duplicate copy of a file that you use if the original file is lost, damaged, or destroyed. 
(When written as two words, back up means to create a copy of a file.) To use a 
backup copy of a file, you first need to restore it, which means to copy the file to its 
original location on your computer.
Before you back up files, you need to make two major decisions: the type of 
backup to create and which backup method to use. Depending on which backup 
method you choose, you might also need to determine where to create and store 
the backup, and how often to back up. Each of these decisions is discussed in the 
following sections.
Understanding Types of Backups
The four most common types of backups for individual computer users are full 
system backups, differential backups, incremental backups, and selective backups. 
As shown in Figure 10–1, a full system backup (also called a system image or a 
disk mirror) is an exact duplication of the hard drive, including data files, system 
files and settings, application files, and the operating system. If your hard drive is 
destroyed, you could remove it, install a new hard drive, and then restore your files 
from the full system backup to have the same setup on the new hard drive as you had 
when you created the backup.

As you add and modify files on the hard drive, you also need to back them 
up. Instead of creating another full system backup to include those files, you can 
perform a differential backup or an incremental backup. A differential backup 
contains copies of the files that have changed since the last full system backup. An  
incremental backup contains copies of the files that have changed since the last full 
system backup or the last incremental backup. See Figure 10–2.

When you perform a selective backup (also called a partial backup), you select 
the folders and files you want to back up. Typically, these include the folders con-
taining the documents, pictures, financial records, and other data files you have cre-
ated or saved. You can also back up data that would be difficult or time-consuming to 
restore, such as contact records, which might be stored in an e-mail application, and 
browser favorites or bookmarks. Figure 10–3 shows a selective backup.

You can perform incremental backups to keep a selective backup current. For 
example, if you create a selective backup of your Documents folder on Monday, you 
can perform an incremental backup on Tuesday to include any new or modified files 
from the Documents folder in the backup.

As Table 10–1 indicates, incremental backups require careful organization so 
you can use them to restore a computer. Creating a full system backup and updat-
ing it with incremental backups means you need the full system backup and all the 
incremental backups to restore a computer. In addition, you must restore the incre-
mental backups in the same order they were created, so you need to identify the 
incremental backups correctly to keep track of their sequence. If you create only 
one full system backup and update it indefinitely with incremental backups, restor-
ing could take a very long time. To make it easier to restore a computer, you can 
­create full system backups periodically, such as every Friday evening, and then per-
form incremental backups from Saturday to Thursday. To restore the computer, you 
would need the most recent full system backup and only six incremental backups.
Selecting a Backup Method
To create a backup, you can use software installed on your computer, or you can use 
an online backup service provider. Most experienced computer users employ a com-
bination of these methods to make sure they have backups that can reliably restore 
their files. 
Using Backup Software
To create any type of backup, you can use backup software, which is a set of system 
utilities for creating and updating backups and for restoring files from a backup. 
Operating systems, third-party software developers, and manufacturers of backup 
media such as external hard drives provide backup software. Backup software

Above and Beyond
For Windows computers, the 
terms “system recovery disk,” 
“system repair disk,” and 
“­system image” are often con-
fused. You use a system recovery 
disk to restore the computer to 
its factory settings—the state it 
was in when you purchased it. 
A system image produces a simi-
lar result, except that you can 
use it to restore the computer 
to the state it was in when you 
created the system image. If the 
computer doesn’t start, you can 
use a system repair disk to load 
the essential files Windows needs 
to start, and then use the system 
recovery disk or the system image 
to restore your computer.

Mod1-275
compresses all the files selected for a backup into a single large file. Along with 
the compressed files, backup software stores an index of file details, including their 
original locations, to restore the files when necessary.
Windows 8 provides the following backup and restore software:
n 
File History—Makes incremental backups of files that have changed in speci-
fied folders. Instead of writing over versions of the same file, File History keeps 
copies of each saved version of a file, so if you need a chart you painstakingly 
created in a document two hours ago, but accidentally deleted the last time you 
saved and closed the document, you can restore the earlier version of the docu-
ment containing the chart. File History does not create full system backups.
n 
System Image Backup—Creates a full system backup. 
n 
Recovery—Restores files from a system image backup.
Mac OS X computers provide backup software similar to the software for 
Windows computers. Like File History, Time Machine makes incremental backups 
of files that have changed on a Mac, and keeps copies of each saved version of a file. 
Unlike File History, Time Machine does create full system backups.
Data you store on a smartphone or tablet is just as valuable as the data on a 
desktop or laptop computer. To protect your data and system files, mobile operating 
systems such as iOS, Android, and Windows RT also include backup software you 
use to create full system and incremental backups.
You can also install other backup software in addition to or as a replacement for 
backup software provided by operating systems. Table 10–2 lists popular backup 
software for desktop and mobile operating systems.

After installing backup software, you set a schedule and select a location for 
the backups. To set a schedule, you might need to first turn on automatic back-
ups. The backup software will then follow the default schedule to create backups 
in the background while you are performing other tasks or while the computer is 
turned on but idle. The default schedule is designed for average computer usage, so 
you should change it if you create or modify files on your computer more or less 
frequently.
Quick Tip
To back up a smartphone or tablet 
running iOS, you can use iCloud 
or iTunes. Backing up to iCloud 
happens automatically when 
your device is connected to the 
Internet. To back up using iTunes, 
you connect your Apple smart-
phone or tablet to a computer on 
which iTunes is installed. You can 
also automatically back up an 
Android device to Google Drive.

Mod1-276	
Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
When you select a location for backups, be sure to select one other than your 
hard drive so you can access the backup files in case of hard drive failure or other 
major computer problems. You typically can choose one of the following locations 
for creating backup files:
n 
External hard drive—Because of its portability, capacity, and ease of use, an 
external hard drive is where most experienced computer users create backups. 
Small external hard drives have a few hundred gigabytes of storage capacity, 
making them suitable for selective backups, while larger external hard drives 
with at least 1 TB of storage space are ideal for maintaining full system backups.
n 
USB flash drive—If you are creating a selective backup of a limited amount of 
data, you can use a USB flash drive, which is inexpensive and convenient for 
backing up documents and other personal files. However, a single USB flash 
drive does not have enough capacity to store a full system backup and its updates.
n 
Optical disc—You can use recordable CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs as backup 
media. Selecting a type of disc that can be read many times but recorded only 
once is an advantage because it does not allow the data to be changed after it is 
backed up. However, that means you need a new optical disc for each backup 
you create. If you want to back up more data than a single optical disc can hold, 
as you would for a full system backup, most backup software can extend the 
backup across multiple optical discs. The disadvantage of optical discs is that 
they are slow to save and access data, so backing up and restoring large files 
from optical discs takes longer than using an external hard drive. 
n 
Network folder—If your computer is on a network, you can create backups to 
a network folder. You need to have permission to save files in the folder and set 
sharing options so that unauthorized users cannot access the backup. The net-
work administrator also needs to provide enough storage space for the backups, 
which might not be practical for large full system backups.
After creating backups using media attached to your computer—one of the first three 
options—you can store the medium close to the computer, which is considered a local 
backup, or take it to an off-site location for safekeeping. Creating and storing a backup on 
a network folder is also considered a local backup if you are using a local area network, 
which is a network that links computers within a building or group of adjacent buildings.
In addition to setting schedules and selecting locations, backup software usually 
allows you to select the following options:
n 
Backup type—You can choose whether to perform a full system, differential, or 
incremental backup. If you want to create a selective backup, you can select the 
folders and files to store in a new backup file.
n 
Encryption—Encryption is a security method that encodes data so that only 
authorized people can access it. Some backup software can encrypt the files in a 
backup, and then decrypt, or reverse the encryption when it restores the files.
n 
Media spanning—If the backup file grows very large, this feature allows you 
to use more than one drive to store the backup file. The backup software keeps 
track of the files stored on each drive and requests the correct drive when you 
restore selected folders and files.
n 
Verification—After backing up the files, backup software compares every file in 
the backup location to the corresponding file on your hard drive to make sure it 
did not skip a file. In addition, you should restore a file or two after creating a 
full system backup to make sure the restore process works correctly.
In Step-by-Step 10.1, you open the File History window and examine its 
settings. Although you will not create a backup in the following steps, you need a 
USB flash drive or other external drive to access all of the File History settings. In 
the following figures, this drive is shown as Removable Disk (E:).
Quick Tip
To be safe, you should create 
more than one backup and keep 
each one up to date. Store at 
least one copy in a safe place 
near your computer for conve-
nience in restoring files. Store at 
least one other copy in an off-site 
location, such as a safe deposit 
box, a locked file cabinet at home 
or work, or a network folder. If 
you store all your backups near 
your computer, and the computer 
is damaged from a calamity such 
as a fire, flood, or intruder, the 
backups could also be damaged 
or destroyed at the same time.

You can use File Explorer to restore any version of a file that File History saved. 
For example, suppose you set up File History to create backups on a network folder. 
You created and saved a report named “Computer Recycling” in a Documents sub-
folder named “Reports.” As you continue to work on and modify the file, File History 
backs it up every hour by default. The report originally included a cover page with 
an illustration representing computer recycling, but during your work, you removed 
the cover page and subsequently saved the file. Now you want to restore the version 
of the Computer Recycling report that included the cover page. To do so, you could 
perform the following steps:
	 1.	 Open File Explorer, and then navigate to the Reports folder in the Documents 
folder, which contains only the latest saved copy of the Computer Recycling 
report.
	 2.	 In the Open group on the Home tab, click the History button. File History 
displays the total number of copies it saved of the files in this folder. 
See Figure 10–7. In this case, File History saved five versions: the most recent 
­version and four earlier versions in the Reports folder.

File History lets you choose to replace the current file with the backup or to skip 
the replacement. If you want to save both the older version and the current one, you 
can move the current version to a different folder or rename it before restoring the 
older version.
You can also use the File History window to restore files, which is a better 
choice if you want to restore many files or folders. In the left pane of the File History 
window, click the Restore personal files link. Select the folders or files to restore, 
and then click the Restore button.
Using Online Backup Service Providers
A popular alternative to installing and using backup software is subscribing to an 
online backup service, which automatically creates backups on a secure server. 
When you create a backup on a server, you are creating an online backup or a 
remote backup.
To use an online backup service, you typically pay a fee to the service pro-
vider. This subscription fee varies depending on how often you want the service 
to create backups, how long you want to retain them, and how much storage space 
you want to reserve. The services let you set the same types of options you can set 
with backup software installed on your computer. For example, you can perform a 
full system, selective, incremental, or differential backup according to a schedule, 
such as once a day when you are not using your computer. After compressing the 
data into a single encrypted file, online backup services store the file on a server. 
To access the backup file, you must enter the correct username and password. 
Most online backup service providers validate the backups periodically, which 
means they check the backup files to make sure you can recover the data they 
contain.

Should you use backup software to create local backups or use online backup 
services to create online backups? Recall that experienced computer users often 
use both methods because each has advantages and disadvantages. To create a local 
backup, you need backup software and removable media with enough capacity to 
hold your backup files. As long as you store the media in a secure place, you always 
have access to the files. If they are not in a secure location, however, they are vulner-
able to theft and damage. Online backups are stored on a secure server, so you don’t 
need to purchase removable media, but you do pay a fee to use the online backup 
service. You must also depend on the backup service to stay in business and protect 
against hackers so you can access your files.

Synchronizing Files
Recall from Lesson 4 that cloud computing provides online software and services 
for you to use to create and store files online. You can use software and online 
services to synchronize your files stored in the cloud with the version of those 
files stored on your computer’s hard drive by comparing files on the two drives, 
and then updating files as necessary so the drives contain the same versions of the 
files. Some cloud storage services such as Dropbox synchronize more than one 
computer with the files you store in a cloud folder. For example, suppose you work 
on a project on your home computer, and then save the project files in your cloud 
folder. You use a school computer to download the files and continue working 
on the project, and then save the updated project files in your cloud folder. Now 
the files in the cloud folder contain more recent data than the files on your home 
computer. When you arrive at home and connect to the Internet, the cloud storage 
service provider synchronizes the files so that you have the most recent versions 
on your home computer.
Although synchronizing is a convenient way to keep copies of files in various 
locations up to date, it is not the same as backing up files, and is not recommended 
as an alternative to creating backups. You can perform both actions—synchronizing 
and backing up—on the same files, though you do so for different reasons. If you 
want to use files in two locations, such as a laptop and a handheld device, you syn-
chronize the files. For example, you synchronize the music files on a laptop and por-
table music player so you can listen to the same music on either device. On the other 
hand, you back up files when you want to store a copy of the files as a safeguard in 
case something goes wrong. You usually access the backup files only if you need to 
restore them to their original location.

Ethical Questions for Cloud Storage
Storing backups and other data in the cloud is easy and convenient, especially if you use more than one 
computer. However, when you share your data with a cloud service provider, you need to consider how 
much control they have over the data. For example, suppose you store backups of your financial records 
in the cloud. To access the cloud folder, you pay a monthly fee for a two-year subscription. Suppose after 
your subscription runs out, the IRS wants to examine your financial records for the last five years. The 
only copy you have of the oldest data is in your cloud folder. In this case, you probably hope that the cloud 
service provider has retained your financial data after your subscription ends. However, is it right that the 
cloud service provider is holding onto your data even when you are no longer using the service? The ethical 
and legal question is who owns the rights to the digital property stored in the cloud? The answer is being 
worked out by users, cloud service providers, and legal professionals.
ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY
Above and Beyond
Online backup services such as 
Carbonite and Mozy are different 
from cloud storage services such 
as SkyDrive and Google Drive. An 
online backup service automati-
cally backs up data to com-
pressed and encrypted backup 
files on a secure server and pro-
vides tools for restoring the data 
to your computer. A cloud storage 
service provides a certain amount 
of space on a secure server where 
you can keep files.

Module 1  Computing Fundamentals
Following a Backup Plan
A backup plan follows a regular schedule for creating different types of backups. 
The ideal plan uses more than one backup method to take advantage of their ben-
efits, provides for storing on-site and off-site backups, and includes redundancy, 
which means you create more than one copy of a backup, so that at least one backup 
survives a destructive event. To do so, you can follow what some experts call the 
Backup 3-2-1 rule:
n 
3 backups—Maintain two full system backups, one labeled Backup A and 
the other labeled Backup B. Each week, create an incremental or differential 
backup, the first week using Backup A and the next week using Backup B. 
Rotating backups keeps your data secure without requiring you to purchase lots 
of backup media. The third backup to create is a selective backup of important 
files you modify, either at the end of the day or more frequently. 
n 
2 types of media—In case a drive or port fails, create the full system backups on 
two types of media, such as an external hard drive and DVDs or a cloud folder.
n 
1 off-site backup—Store one of the full system backups off-site and store the 
other in a safe place in your home or office. When you create an incremental or 
differential backup each week, swap the on-site copy with the off-site copy. In 
this scheme, you always store the most recent full system backup off-site.
Protecting Hardware
Backups are the best protection for digital data, and software tools such as antivirus 
software are designed to protect your operating system and other files. You also need 
to consider protecting your hardware—the computer and its peripherals—from theft 
and physical harm. Protecting computer data, software, and hardware is part of your 
responsibility as a computer owner.
Protecting Against Environmental Damage
Computers and peripheral devices can be harmed by environmental hazards, includ-
ing temperature extremes, humidity, electrical fields, and power fluctuations. Apply 
the following guidelines to protect your computer against environmental hazards 
in the places where you use the computer:
n 
Temperature—Computer components work best in a temperature range of 68 to 
75 degrees (F). If the temperature in a room exceeds 85 degrees, internal com-
puter components can overheat, which can make a computer unstable. Set the 
heating and cooling system to maintain a temperature in the optimal range for 
computers.
n 
Humidity—High humidity can damage internal computer components. If water 
vapor penetrates a system unit, it can collect and eventually cause a short circuit, 
which could destroy electronic components. Extreme dryness can also cause 
problems, especially those related to static electricity. A static charge to an open 
system unit can zap an entire motherboard. Take precautions to keep the humid-
ity between 30 and 50 percent.
◗  Vocabulary

redundancy
Above and Beyond
In addition to a backup plan, 
businesses often create a disas-
ter recovery plan, a set of written 
guidelines that specifies how 
to restore a computer in case 
a disaster such as a hurricane 
or flood, a technical problem, 
such as a computer failure, or a 
catastrophe created by a person, 
such as a virus or theft. A disas-
ter recovery plan should indicate 
how to return to normal opera-
tions, such as where to acquire 
replacement computers, where 
backup files are stored, and 
how to restore them. Individual 
computer users can create such 
a plan too, especially if they 
depend on their computer for 
work or essential services.

n 
Water and other liquids—Water or other liquids in the system unit or any other 
hardware receiving power can cause a short circuit, which is why you should not 
keep beverages near your computer. If a computer is turned off and water seeps 
into the system, such as during a flood, you have a good chance of salvaging the 
computer by taking it to a repair professional who can open the case and dry 
everything before restoring power. 
n 
Physical damage—Current mobile computers are designed to withstand shock 
from moderate drops and bumps. (A desktop computer has less shock-absorbing 
material.) The most likely component to be affected by physical jarring is the 
hard drive, and recovering a hard drive is time consuming even if you have a full 
system backup. Transport mobile computers with care, such as in padded cases.
 
Display screens, especially on smartphones and tablets, can also be cracked 
from physical impact. See Figure 10–11. Even minor damage to a touchscreen 
means the screen needs to be replaced, though it is often more expensive to 
repair the screen than to buy a new device.

Power fluctuations—Lesson 9 described the hazards of power surges and power 
failures. To protect against fluctuations in power, you can plug a computer into 
a surge protector (also called a surge suppressor) when the computer is run-
ning on power from a wall outlet. A surge suppressor traps short, fast bursts of 
power before it can harm a computer. To protect against loss of power to a desk-
top computer or a recharging mobile computer, you can use an uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS), which contains a battery that provides power if the normal 
current is interrupted. As with a surge protector, you plug a computer’s power 
cord or a power adapter cord into the UPS and plug the UPS into a power outlet. 
Figure 10–12 shows a surge protector and a UPS.

Protecting Against Theft
Because computer equipment and the data stored on it are valuable, they are 
vulnerable to theft. Basic precautions such as locking doors, especially to 
rooms containing computers, can be a deterrent. You can also use a cable lock 
to secure a mobile computer to a desk or table, as shown in Figure 10–13, or 
attach an alarm that sounds when a computer or drive is unplugged.

Installing tracking software increases the chances of recovering a stolen com-
puter. You can trigger the tracking software remotely so it sends its location and 
identifying information to another specified computer. For example, Apple pro-
vides tracking software for its mobile computers; the one for the iPhone is called 
Find My iPhone. If the iPhone is turned on and connected to the Internet, you can 
use another computer to track the location of the iPhone using GPS technology. If 
you’ve lost your iPhone, you can use Find My iPhone to beep and display a phone 
number where you can be reached along with a message such as “This iPhone has 
been lost. Please call me.” Find My iPhone also locks the device so no one can 
access your data. Other features to look for in computer tracking software include 
the following:
n 
Alarm—An alarm feature repeatedly plays an urgent sound to help you locate a 
device or to alert others that an unauthorized person has your device.
n 
Data removal—Besides locking the device, this feature lets you erase your data 
remotely. This option is the most useful if you have backed up your data first.
n 
Unauthorized user notification—If your computer includes a camera, this fea-
ture lets you set the camera to take a photo of anyone who enters an incorrect 
password three times. You can also have the computer send you an e-mail 
message displaying the photo and location of the unauthorized user.
n 
Battery control—After using GPS to find a lost mobile device, you can use the 
battery control feature to turn off GPS to conserve battery power.
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
A backup is a duplicate copy of a file that you use if the origi-
nal file is lost, damaged, or destroyed. To use a backup copy of 
a file, you first need to restore it, which means to copy the file 
to its original location on your computer.
n 
The four most common types of backups for individual com-
puter users are full system backups, differential backups, incre-
mental backups, and selective backups. Each of these types has 
advantages and disadvantages.
n 
A full system backup (also called a system image or a disk 
mirror) is an exact duplication of the hard drive, including 
data files, system files and settings, application files, and the 
operating system. 
n 
A differential backup contains copies of the files that have 
changed since the last full system backup, while an incremen-
tal backup contains copies of the files that have changed since 
the last full system backup or the last incremental backup.
n 
When you perform a selective backup, you select the folders 
and files you want to back up. 
n 
To create a backup, you can use backup software installed on 
your computer, or you can use an online backup service provider. 
Summary
n 
Backup software is a set of system utilities for creating and 
updating backups and for restoring files from a backup. 
Operating systems, third-party software developers, and manu-
facturers of backup media provide backup software. Backup 
software compresses all the files selected for a backup into a 
single large file, and stores an index of file details, including 
their original locations, to restore the files.
n 
After installing backup software, you set a schedule and select 
a location for the backups. The backup software follows the 
schedule to create backups in the background. Backup loca-
tions typically include an external hard drive, USB flash drive, 
optical disc, or network folder.
n 
Backup software features include backup type options, encryp-
tion, media spanning, and data verification.
n 
An online backup service automatically creates backups on a 
secure server. When you create a backup on a server, you are 
creating an online backup or a remote backup.
n 
To use an online backup service, you typically pay a fee to the 
service provider, and then set the same types of options you 
can set with backup software installed on your computer.

Module 2  Key Applications
Microsoft Office 2013 is an integrated software package that enables you to share 
information between several applications. The applications (also referred to as apps) 
available in Office are Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, 
InfoPath, Lync, Project, SharePoint Workspace, and Visio. The applications available 
on your computer depend on which Office suite is installed and the options that were 
selected during the installation. Microsoft offers several different Office suites, such as 
Office Professional 2013, Office 365, and Office Home and Student 2013. Each suite 
offers a different combination of applications. Each Office application performs specific 
tasks. Table 11–1 provides a brief description of the Office 2013 applications available.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions in this module generally provide directions for using a mouse to 
access commands and features. For example, the instructions may refer to actions 
such as point, click, double-click, or right-click. If you are using a touchscreen, you 
can use gestures such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead of following the 
directions for using the mouse.
Starting and Closing Applications
Starting applications, launching applications, and opening applications all have the 
same meaning. Closing applications and exiting applications also have the same 
meaning. Not only are the steps for starting and closing all Office applications 
the same, but the steps will also apply to most other applications, such as Internet 
Explorer 11 and Windows Media Player.
Starting Applications and Switching Between 
Applications
When you log on to a computer, the Start screen displays. You can start an ­application 
by selecting the application tile on the Start screen. When you select an application, 
you can choose to open an existing file or use a template to create a new file.

Step-by-Step 11.1
A template provides the basic structure and document settings such as text formats 
and page layout. An application window then opens and serves as the primary inter-
face between the user and the application.
You can also open an application using the File Explorer. When you double-
click a filename, the selected file automatically opens in the correct application. A 
shortcut, which is often a button that sits on your desktop, is a pointer to an applica-
tion or document file to the program. When you double-click the shortcut button, the 
application and/or the file opens.
Multiple applications can be open at the same time. A button for each open appli-
cation appears on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. To switch from one open 
application to another, click the application button on the taskbar. Buttons for com-
monly used applications, such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, may 
also appear on the taskbar, even if they are not running. To rearrange the order of the 
buttons on the taskbar, you can drag and drop the application buttons to reposition them.
You can display the desktop without closing any of the applications by right-
clicking the taskbar and then choosing a command in a shortcut menu, a list of 
commonly performed commands from the current window. When you display the 
desktop, all the open applications are minimized, which means the applications are 
still running, but the application windows no longer appear on the screen. However, 
the application button(s) still appear on the taskbar, and you can click those buttons 
to reopen the applications.
You can view multiple application windows at the same time by changing the 
layout of the windows on the screen. To access the different window layout options, 
right-click the taskbar and select an option from the shortcut menu.

Navigating Application Windows
The application window includes many of the elements of all Windows screens, 
including the title bar, scroll bars, and the status bar. These elements are labeled in 
Figure 11–10. The document window is the area where you type new text and data 
or change existing text and data. The application windows can be resized on your 
screen by using the Minimize, Maximize, and Restore Down buttons.

The insertion point (often referred to as the cursor) is a blinking vertical line that 
indicates the location in the document where the new text and data will be entered. 
The arrow keys on the keyboard move the insertion point up, down, left, and right 
in the document. The Page Up and Page Down keys move the insertion point in big-
ger increments. To use the mouse to reposition the insertion point, simply move the 
mouse pointer to the desired location within the document. When positioned within 
the document window, the pointer changes from an arrow to an I-beam, which looks 
like a capital letter I. Position the I-beam over the text in the document where you 
would like to reposition the insertion point, and then click.
When you scroll through a document, you move through the document window 
on the screen without changing the location of the insertion point. The display on 
the screen adjusts as you scroll. To scroll, use the horizontal or vertical scroll bars. 
Other convenient ways to scroll, if available, are to use the wheel on the mouse or the 
trackpad or to swipe the touchscreen.

Using the Office User Interface
The Office applications use a visual design referred to as the Microsoft Office Fluent 
user interface. There are many features in this new design that make the software 
more intuitive and easier to use.
Using the Office Ribbon
The Ribbon is the banner that stretches across the top of the screen, just below 
the title bar. The Ribbon user interface displays several tabs, including the 
HOME tab, shown in Figure 11–12. The Ribbon makes it easy to find commands 
because related commands and options are organized in groups on each tab. For 
example, all of the commands for formatting characters appear in the Font group. 
A dialog box launcher (a small arrow) appears in the lower-right corner of some 
groups, and when clicked, a dialog box opens with even more options related to 
the group.

Figure 11–12  Ribbon user interface
What makes the Ribbon so unique is that it changes to meet your needs. As you 
work in a document, the Ribbon adapts by providing appropriate commands and 
options. For example, if you insert a picture in your document, the Ribbon changes 
to display tabs related to formatting pictures—hence, the word fluent in Office 
Fluent user interface.
If you do not know the function of a button in any of the groups, position the 
mouse pointer over the button, but do not click. After a second or two, the name and 
a description of the command are displayed in a window called a ScreenTip.
If you prefer to use the keyboard instead of the mouse, you can access the tabs 
on the Ribbon by using keyboard shortcuts that you can display on the Ribbon. 
Commands can also be accessed with legacy keyboard shortcuts, which have been 
around for many versions of the application. When a keyboard shortcut is available 
for the command, the shortcut is included in the ScreenTip.
To maximize the screen space for your document, you can easily minimize the 
Ribbon by double-clicking one of the tabs. To restore the Ribbon to its original size, 
you simply double-click one of the tabs.

Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
By default, the Quick Access Toolbar is positioned above the Ribbon in the upper-
left corner of the application window. This toolbar offers quick access to commands 
you use frequently. The default settings, as shown in Figure 11–16, include only 
four options—the Save, Undo, Redo or Repeat, and Touch/Mouse Mode commands. 
However, you can customize the toolbar to include the commands you use most 
often. Keep in mind that the intent of the toolbar is for quick access. If you add too 
many commands and the toolbar becomes cluttered, it may slow you down.

Opening, Saving, and Closing Documents
You use similar procedures to open and save documents in all Office applications. 
To open a document means to load a file into an application. A file is a collection of 
information saved as a unit. Each file is identified by a filename. Remember that the 
terms document and file are used interchangeably.
Opening a Document
The Open command in Backstage view, which is accessed using the FILE tab, enables 
you to open a file from any available disk and folder. You can also open a document 
by navigating to the document on the desktop or by using File Explorer. Once you 
locate the file, double-click the filename. If necessary, your computer will start the 
associated application (such as Word or Excel), and then the document will open.
A file extension identifies the type of file. A period separates the filename and the 
extension. The extension is usually three or four characters and varies depending on 
the application used to create the document. For example, Word automatically assigns 
the extension .docx, PowerPoint assigns the extension .pptx, and Excel assigns the 
extension .xlsx. The x in the extensions indicates the XML format. You can quickly 
identify documents created in versions of these applications prior to Office 2007 
because the file extensions created in those applications are .doc, .ppt, and .xls.
A folder is a means for organizing files into manageable groups on a designated 
storage device. All computer files are saved in folders. Subfolders, folders within 
folders, can also be created. The path is the route the operating system uses to locate 
a document. The path identifies the disk and any folders relative to the location of 
the document. Figure 11–18 shows two typical paths and identifies the items in 
the paths. The first example shows a document named Recycled Automobiles.docx 
saved in a subfolder titled Lesson 11. The Lesson 11 folder is, in turn, stored in a 
folder titled Data Files for Students, which can be found on the local (this com-
puter’s) hard drive—drive C. In the second example, the Word document named 
Revised Recycled Automobiles.docx is saved in a subfolder called Lesson 11, which 
is in turn stored in a folder titled Solutions, which can be found on a Flash/USB 
removable memory, which in this example is identified as Removable Disk E.

cation, the taskbar displays the documents stacked behind the application button. 
Point to the application button on the taskbar to display thumbnails of each of the 
open documents for that application. Then to make a document active, click the doc-
ument thumbnail. When you right-click the application button on the taskbar, a Jump 
List is displayed above the button. A Jump List is a collection of links that provides 
quick access to files and data. The links displayed in a Jump List vary depending on 
the application. For example, a Jump List for an Office application provides short-
cuts to recently accessed documents. A Jump List for Internet Explorer provides 
shortcuts to frequently accessed Web sites.

Solving Problems with Opening Documents
You may encounter some problems when opening files. The following are descrip-
tions of common problems:
n	
There is a problem with file compatibility. File compatibility refers to the ability 
to open and work with files without a format conflict. In most cases, files that 
were created with an older version of an application can be opened in the newer 
version of the application. But sometimes, files created in newer applications 
are not backwards compatible, meaning that they cannot be opened in older ver-
sions of the application. Office 2013 files are saved in a new format, and they 
will not normally open in versions of Office applications prior to Office 2007. 
Microsoft does, however, provide a free download of compatibility software to 
enable users with older versions of Office to open, edit, and save files created 
and saved in the new Office 2013 format.
n	
You may also encounter compatibility problems if you are working in a different 
operating system than the one in which the file was created. For example, if a file 
was created in PowerPoint on a Macintosh, it may not open in PowerPoint on a 
PC. This problem generally occurs if you are working with different versions of 
the software across the different platforms. With a little effort, however, you can 
usually find a way to open and use almost any file from an Office application.
n	
If when you use the Open command from the FILE tab you do not see the file 
you are looking for, the recent documents list, it could be caused by a number of 
reasons. First, you need to verify the document was saved before it was closed. 
Second, you need to verify you are looking in the correct disk and the correct 
folder, as the file you are looking for may be stored in a different location. If the 
file is stored in a remote storage area or on a network, you must make sure you

of the file, you can use the Search command, available in the upper-right corner

The file is in a format that cannot be read by the application you are using. For 
example, if you attempt to open an Access file using the Open command in 
Word, you will not see the file listed. You can switch the file type setting within 
the Open dialog box to display All Files, but that does not necessarily mean that 
the application you are using will be able to open the file.
n	
You encounter a corrupted file or a file that will not open. When you attempt to 
open a file, the application may display an error message as you try to open the file. 
For example, a virus checker may be stopping you from opening the file. Often a 
corrupted file may just not open, or it may cause the application to shut down. In 
these cases, you can try to open the file on a different computer to verify that the 
file is indeed corrupt and that there is not something wrong with your computer.
Saving a Document
To save a document means to store it on a disk or other storage medium. You can 
save a document to the hard drive on your computer, to an auxiliary drive or a net-
work location, or to portable media such as Flash/USB removable memory or a writ-
able CD or DVD. A file extension is automatically added to the filename when the 
document is saved.
To make it easier to find documents, choose filenames with words that help 
describe the document. The complete path to the file can include up to 255 charac-
ters. Filenames cannot include any of the following characters: \ / : * ? “ < > |.
You should make a habit of saving frequently and also after making any major 
changes to your document. The quickest and easiest way to save a document is to 
click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar. When you click the Save button on 
the toolbar, the document is saved with the same filename and in the same location.  
If the file does not already have a name, the Save As dialog box will open and you can 
type a name for the file. Unless you specify a disk and a folder, the file will be saved 
to the default location, which is usually in the Documents folder on drive C. When you 
change the filename or the location where the file is stored, the original document, with 
the original name, remains unchanged. When you use the Save As command, you also 
have the opportunity to change the document format. Each application offers a number 
of choices for formats to save files in.
There are several options for closing a document. When you open Backstage 
view, you can access the Close command, which will close the active document. If 
you attempt to close a document without saving changes to a document, you will be 
prompted to save the changes before closing. You can also close the active document 
and exit the application by clicking the Close button in the upper-right corner of the 
application window. If multiple documents are open, clicking the Close button will 
close only the active document. When only one document is open, clicking the Close 
button will close the document and exit the application.
When you point to an application button on the taskbar, thumbnails of the open 
documents are displayed above the button. You can close a document by clicking the 
Close button on the thumbnail. Whether you click the Close button in the application 
window or the Close button on the thumbnail, when you close the last open docu-
ment, the application closes too.

Module 2  Key Applications
Getting Help
Whenever you encounter a problem, your first source of help should be the Help 
features found in each Office application. If you have an Internet connection, help 
is always readily available and is just a few mouse clicks away. You simply click the 
Help button, which looks like a question mark, on the title bar of the dialog box. This 
button opens a Help window that provides information about the application.
Navigating around the Help screens is much like navigating through a Web 
page. You can browse the categories presented and click on links to get information 
about a topic. You can also enter keywords (specific words or phrases) in the Search 
box. The results for your search will be listed, with links for the most relevant results 
at the top of the list. Achieving successful search results depends on your ability 
to identify the keywords that relate to your query. The more search experience you 
have, the better you will be at recognizing keywords for your searches. To access 
previous searches, click the Search list arrow.
If you have an Internet connection, you will also have access to all the current 
Help information available from the Microsoft Office.com Web site or other support 
specialists. At the Office.com Web site you will find a variety of resources, includ-
ing tours, slide shows, tutorials, training videos, articles, product user groups, blogs, 
and the opportunity to chat with Microsoft support personnel. If the word Offline 
appears at the bottom of the Help dialog box, your computer is not currently con-
nected to the Internet, but you can still access Help information from files stored on 
your computer. You may need to check with your instructor about how to connect to 
the Internet from your computer.
Do not overlook another vital source of help: assistance from others. There may 
be classmates, instructors, or coworkers who are familiar with the application you 
are using. Or perhaps your workplace has a help desk. You can communicate with 
support personnel via phone, e-mail, online chat sessions, user groups, and blogs. 
The key to using these various sources of help is determining what sort of help you 
need and the quickest or most efficient way to access that help. The idea is to find the 
assistance you need without interrupting or delaying your work.
Office Web Apps
Microsoft Office Web Apps are online companions to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote that enable you to 
access documents anytime and anywhere. Regardless of where you are, you can create, edit, save, and share your 
documents. All you need is a connection to the Web. Office Web Apps provide browser-based viewing in which 
your document appears similar to how it would appear in the application on your computer, with many of the same 
editing features available. You can access Office Web Apps through Windows Live, and you can store documents to 
SkyDrive, a free online storage service from Windows Live. With permission, others can also access your documents 
at SkyDrive, even if they do not have the Office application installed on their computers.

ticular application often, instead of using the Start screen or Start 
menu to open the application, it would be convenient to be able to 
open the application from the taskbar. Explore the options to pin an 
application to the taskbar. Also explore how to remove the applica-
tion from the taskbar. If you practice pinning the application to the 
task bar, make sure you remove it from the taskbar.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document and save the docu-
ment as ES 11–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Write a brief paragraph describing how to add an 
application to the taskbar.
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document, and then 
close the document.

Module 2  Key Applications
Word is a powerful, full-featured word-processing application. You can use Word 
to create letters, reports, tables, memos, faxes, blogs, and much more. The Word 
lessons in this course will introduce you to the commonly used features that enable 
you to prepare documents efficiently. You will also learn how to change the way the 
document looks on the screen and how to navigate through a document.
Creating a New Document
When you first start the Word application and create a new blank document, the new 
document is automatically titled Document1. The blank document is formatted with 
default settings, which are the preset options or variables automatically in effect when 
the document is created. The default settings for Word documents are stored in the 
Normal.dotm template, a file containing default styles and customizations that deter-
mine the structure and page layout of a document. Using the Normal.dotm template 
greatly increases the speed and efficiency of your work as you do not need to spend 
time setting up the details of the document formats. Information about overriding the 
default settings and changing document formats is provided in Lessons 13 and 16.
You can open additional documents on top of Document1. All new blank 
­document filenames will be numbered sequentially during the session when Word 
is open. The filenames for each open document stay the same until you assign a new 
filename. When the Word application is closed and then restarted, the new blank 
document filenames begin again with Document1.
Step-by-Step 12.1
	 1.	 Start Word and create a new blank document. The new document is 
based on the Normal.dotm template. Notice that the document title bar 
shows Document1. (If Word was already started when you began this 
exercise, the document number might be higher than the number 1.)
	 2.	 Click the FILE tab to display the Backstage view options, and then click 
the New command. The Template gallery options may vary, but the 
Blank document thumbnail should appear first in the gallery as shown 
in Figure 12–1.

	 3.	 Click the Blank document thumbnail. A new document based on the 
Normal.dotm template opens. Notice that the document title bar shows 
Document2. (The number in the filename will be one number higher 
than the number in the previous filename.)
	 4.	 In the upper-right corner of the application window, click the Close 
­button to close the current document, which is Document2.
	 5.	 Leave the other blank document (Document1) open for the next 
Step-by-Step.
Changing Word Settings
As you work with Word, you will begin to recognize “behind the scenes” ­application 
settings that are designed to protect your work and improve your efficiency. For 
example, the default format for saving a document is the XML format that 
­compresses the file size and allows you to open files, even if a component within the 
file is damaged or corrupted. If desired, you can change the setting and save the file 
in a different format.
If you have ever experienced your computer locking up or shutting down while 
you are working with a document, you may have had the opportunity to recover one 
or more of your documents upon restarting the application. This is because there is a 
setting to schedule an automatic save of the document information as you work with 
the document. You can easily customize a setting like this to fit your preferences and 
meet your needs.
Initiative Is Essential to Success
Are you optimistic and upbeat? Do you generate good energy and good will? Do you perform tasks that 
need to be completed without being asked? Demonstrating initiative is essential for success. Individuals 
with strong initiative do not just accept the status quo. They adapt to new situations, and they seek new 
and challenging work. You can confirm your commitment by taking ownership of your tasks and handling 
responsibilities with minimum direction and supervision.

Inserting Text and Numbers into a Document
As you enter text in a Word document, the insertion point moves to the right, and the 
information on the left side of the status bar at the bottom of the document window 
changes to reflect the page number for the current position of the insertion point. The 
information on the status bar is continually updated to show the current total number 
of words in the document.

Users of previous versions of Word 
prior to Word 2010 are unable 
to open files saved in the new 
format, unless they have installed 
compatibility software. If you often 
share your documents with users 
working with previous versions of 
Word, you should consider chang-
ing the file format setting so all 
documents are saved in the Word 
97–2003 (*.doc) format. The 
drawback to this is that some of 
the new Word 2013 features are 
inaccessible in such a document.

Module 2  Key Applications
Entering Text in a Document
As you add text to the document, you may see a red or green wavy line under some of 
the words. Using the default settings, Word automatically checks the spelling and gram-
mar in a document as you are entering the text, and the wavy lines suggest there may be 
spelling or grammar errors. If you see any wavy lines while entering text in this lesson, 
ignore them. You will learn more about the spelling and grammar features in Lesson 13.
If the text you are entering extends beyond the right margin, Word will auto-
matically wrap the text to the next line. This feature is called word wrap. When you 
press Enter to start a new line in the document, you create a new paragraph. In a 
document based on the Normal.dotm template, Word automatically adds extra space 
after each paragraph, so you do not need to press Enter a second time to create a 
blank space between paragraphs. The extra space after a paragraph makes the docu-
ment easier to read. Extra space is also added between the lines within a paragraph. 
You can use the Tab key to indent the first line of a paragraph. 
Step-by-Step 12.3
	 1.	 If necessary, start Word and create a new blank document.
	 2.	 Press Tab and then type the sentence below shown in bold. Notice as you 
enter the text that the insertion point moves in the document ­window, and 
when the text expands to the right side of the screen, the text automati-
cally wraps to the next line and blank space is created between the lines.
	
	
Today, the majority of the American ­population lives in cities and 
­suburbs. For both ­recreation and contact with nature, people who live 
in ­metropolitan areas depend on parks and recreational paths close to 
their homes.
	 3.	 Note that the status bar reflects the number of words in the document, 
as shown in Figure 12–4. Also, if the proofing icon shows a checkmark, 
there are no potential errors cited.
No prooﬁng
errors
	 4.	 Press Enter to start a new paragraph. Note that extra space is added 
between the existing paragraph and the new location of the insertion point.
	 5.	 Press Tab and then type the sentence below.
	
	
Greenways connect parks surrounding and ­running through 
­metropolitan areas. Sometimes these ­greenways even link cities 
together.

the folder structure at the top of the dialog box to the default file loca-
tion setting that you noted in Step 6 in Step-by-Step 12.2. The path 
displayed at the top of the Save As dialog box may not be the default

Showing Characters and Using Click and Type
As you have learned, changing the way a document looks on the screen can make 
tasks easier. To make editing a document easier, you can also show some special 
characters. These characters are known as nonprinting characters because, although 
you can show these symbols on the screen, they do not print.

Module 2  Key Applications
On the HOME tab in the Paragraph group, the Show/Hide ¶ button enables 
you to toggle the option to show these nonprinting characters. When you toggle 
an option, you alternate between the off and on states by repeating a procedure, 
such as clicking a button. Nonprinting characters include paragraph markers, blank 
spaces, page or section breaks, and tab markers. Initially, you may not like showing 
­nonprinting characters while you work with a document, but give it a try. Once you 
get used to seeing the nonprinting characters on the screen, you will find them very 
useful as you create and edit the document.
Click and type is a Word setting that enables you to quickly position the ­insertion 
point within a blank area of a document. When you double-click in a blank space in 
the document, Word automatically adds the necessary blank paragraphs or tabs to 
position the insertion point where you click. Showing the nonprinting characters can 
be very helpful when using click and type. When you reposition the insertion point 
in a blank area of the document, new nonprinting paragraph markers and tab markers 
indicate how many blank paragraphs or tabs were created to move the insertion point 
to the new location.
Step-by-Step 12.4
	 1.	 If necessary, open the Greenways 1 document from your solution files. 
Save the Greenways 1 document as Greenways 2, followed by your 
initials.
	 2.	 On the HOME tab, in the Paragraph group, click the Show/Hide ¶ ­button 
 to toggle the feature on. When toggled on, the button will have a blue 
background.
	 3.	 Compare your document to Figure 12–6. The nonprinting symbols are 
identified in the figure. If necessary, scroll up in the document to see 
the symbols. If you do not see the nonprinting characters on your screen, 
click the Show/Hide ¶ button again.
	 4.	 Make sure that the click-and-type setting is enabled:
	 a.	 Click the FILE tab to open Backstage view.
	 b.	 Click the Options command to open the Word Options dialog box.
	 c.	 In the left pane, click Advanced.
	 d.	 In the right pane, below Editing options, make sure there is a check 
mark in the Enable click and type box. The option is turned on when 
there is a check mark in the check box, as shown in Figure 12–7.

Changing Views and Magnification
Changing the way the document looks on your screen can make working with the 
document much easier. You can change the way you view your document, and you 
can also change the magnification to control how much of the document is shown on 
the screen. The appearance of the document on the screen should be appropriate for 
the current task.
Changing the Document View
Word offers different options for viewing a document. Each view provides a dif-
ferent way to look at and work with a document. Table 12–1 describes each of the 
views. As you work with documents in the different views, you may find that you 
prefer one view for certain tasks and another view for other tasks.
When you create a new document, the document opens in Print Layout view. 
You can change the view by selecting options from the Views group on the VIEW 
tab. You can also change the view by clicking one of the view buttons in the status 
bar in the lower- right corner of the application window. Saved documents will open 
in Read Mode, Print Layout, or Web Layout view, whichever view was most recently 
displayed.
QUICK TIP
When entering numbers in a doc-
ument, you can use the numbers 
in the top row on the keyboard or 
you can use the numbers on the 
number keypad. If the numbers 
are not displayed on the screen 
when you use the keypad, press 
the Num Lock key on the keypad.

Read Mode
The screen space is maximized for reading the document. Using the default ­settings, 
two pages are shown side by side as though you are reading a book. You can change 
the settings to change the column width, page color, and layout. Read Mode is 
often referred to as Protected mode because most editing functions are disabled to 
provide protection from potentially malicious software.
Print Layout
The document is displayed on the screen as it will appear when printed. This is the 
default view setting.
Web Layout
The document is shown on the screen as it will appear in a Web browser.
Outline
The document content is shown on the screen in an outline format, which makes it 
easy to see the structure of the document and to quickly and easily reorganize the 
content.
Draft
Only the basic document, without elements such as headers and footers, is shown on 
the screen. The purpose of Draft view is to make the editing process quicker.

Changing the Zoom Settings
Zoom options enable you to increase and decrease the size of text and graphics on 
the screen. You can also show an entire page or multiple pages at the same time. 
When you open a new document or a saved document, the document window is 
displayed with the default zoom setting for the current document view. The default 
settings vary because of the screen size, the screen resolution settings, and the panes 
displayed on the screen. 
You can easily change the zoom settings using options in the Zoom group on the 
VIEW tab, which is shown in Figure 12–14. You will also find zoom controls on the 
right side of the status bar at the bottom of the document window. If your mouse has 
a scroll wheel, you can use the mouse to zoom in and out.
View and zoom settings are saved with a document, and usually when you open 
a document, it is displayed in the view and zoom setting in which it was last viewed, 
with two exceptions. If the document was last viewed in either Outline or Draft view, 
the document will reopen in Print Layout view.

Navigating Through the Document
There are many ways to save time moving through both long and short Word docu-
ments, including using the Navigation Pane, scrolling, and using the Go To command 
and keyboard shortcuts.
Using the Navigation Pane
When working with long documents, you can easily move through a document by 
using the Navigation Pane. In the Navigation Pane, you can search for specific text 
in the document. You can also choose the option to view thumbnails for each page in 
the document. Each thumbnail is identified with a page number, and the current page 
is also identified in the status bar. Although most words may be too small to read 
on a thumbnail, usually graphics or headings will help you identify the page. To go 
directly to a specific page, click the thumbnail for that page.

	 4.	 Click the third result for the search beginning with but I learned from.... 
The insertion point moves to the third occurrence of the word ruts at the 
end of the document.
	 5.	 Delete the text in the Search document box.
	 6.	 Under the Search document box, click the PAGES option. Four thumb-
nails are displayed in the Navigation Pane. The page number is shown 
below the thumbnail.

in the document window.
	 8.	 In the Navigation Pane, click the Page 4 thumbnail. Page 4 is displayed 
in the document window.
	 9.	 Leave the document open for the next Step-by-Step.
Scrolling and Using the Go To Command
If the location you want to navigate to is currently on the screen, you can simply 
position the mouse pointer and click. If the part of the document you want to view 
is currently not visible, you can use the scroll bars to navigate to that part of the 
document. The scroll bars enable you to quickly move to other areas of the docu-
ment. If the zoom settings are set for page width (the default setting) or a smaller 
percentage, the horizontal scroll bar will not appear because the entire width of the 
document is already visible.
The position of the scroll box on the scroll bar helps you identify what part of 
the document you are viewing. As you drag the scroll box, a ScreenTip tells you 
what page you are viewing. As you learned in Lesson 11, when you scroll through 
a document, the insertion point does not move. If you scroll to a new part of the 
document and want to reposition the insertion point on that page, then you just click 
where you want the insertion point.
When navigating through a multipage document, the Go To command can 
be very useful, because you can go directly to a specific page, a specific line, or a 
­specific type of content in the document.
When you reopen a document, either in Read Mode or in Print Layout view, 
Word remembers where you last were in the document when you closed it. To 
quickly navigate to that location, you can click the Resume Reading callout. Resume 
Reading works even when you reopen the document from a different computer or 
other device.

Using the Keyboard
If you have good keyboarding skills, using the keyboard to move the insertion point 
can speed up your navigation. Using the keyboard eliminates the need to move your 
hand back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse. You can use the arrow 
keys on the keyboard to move the insertion point one character at a time or one line 
at a time. If you need to move across several characters or lines, however, using a 
combination of keys will make the task easier and quicker. Table 12–2 provides 
a list of keys and key combinations for moving the insertion point throughout the 
document.

United States. In the ­nineteenth century, the New Madrid 
Fault caused three of the most powerful earthquakes in U.S. 
­history. Damage from the earthquake was reported as far 
away as Charleston, South Carolina, and Washington, DC. 
One earthquake along this fault line was so powerful that it 
caused the Mississippi River to change course.

Microsoft released the first version of Word for an IBM PC in 
1983. The early versions of Word were created for MS-DOS, not 
Windows. Word made full use of the mouse, but few people used 
the mouse at this time. They usually accessed the commands by 
keystrokes, and users often memorized the necessary keystrokes. 
So, keyboard shortcuts have been around for a long time. You 
learned several keyboard shortcuts in this lesson, but there are 
many more.
Choose a partner to help you find keyboard shortcuts for com-
mands related to the following:
n 
Displaying and using windows
n 
Using dialog boxes
n 
Using the Open and Save As dialog boxes
	 1.	 Use the Word Help system to learn about keyboard 
shortcuts for commands related to the above topics.
	 2.	 Try some of the shortcuts described in your list to 
see if the shortcuts work on your computer.
	 3.	 Create a new Word document, and save the docu-
ment as TP 12–1, followed by your initials.
	 4.	 List three or four shortcuts that you and your partner will most 
likely use.
	 5.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.
	 6.	 Demonstrate those shortcuts to others in the class, providing 
an explanation as to why you and your partner think the short-
cuts are helpful.

The arrangement of a standard keyboard on a com-
puter (or a typewriter) is called QWERTY, referring 
to the first six characters in the top row of letters. But 
why are the letters on the keyboard not arranged in 
alphabetical order, or some other logical order? Why QWERTY?
	 1.	 Search the Internet to learn the history of the QWERTY 
­keyboard and the Dvorak keyboard.
	 2.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as  
OD 12–2, followed by your initials.
	 3.	 Write a brief summary of your findings. Cite your sources by 
copying the Web page URL and pasting the information at the 
bottom of the summary.

Module 2  Key Applications
Editing Documents
When you edit a document, you modify or adapt the document and make revisions  
or corrections. Editing a document involves adding, deleting, changing, or moving 
text.
Selecting Text
When you select text, you identify a block of text you want to edit. The text can be 
a single character, several characters, a word, a sentence, one or more paragraphs, or 
even the entire document. Once you select text, you can delete it, replace it, change 
its appearance, move it, copy it, and so on. You can use the mouse, the keyboard, or 
the touch screen to select text. The quickest way to select text using the mouse is to 
click and hold the mouse button, drag the mouse pointer over the desired text, and 
then release the mouse button.
Sometimes it is difficult to select precisely when you are dragging the mouse. 
Table 13–1 lists several options for selecting text using the mouse and the keyboard. 
To deselect the text (remove the highlighting that indicates selection), click any-
where in the document window or press an arrow key. If you accidentally delete or 
replace selected text, or if you just change your mind, click the Undo button.
Editing and formatting features give you the ability to refine your documents and 
determine how they will look on the screen, on the Web, or as printed pages. Word 
provides many features that enable you to make changes, correct errors, and check 
the spelling and the grammar in your document.

Deleting and Inserting Characters
Editing often involves deleting and replacing existing text. You can quickly delete 
characters one at a time by using either the Backspace or Delete key. Backspace 
deletes the character to the left of the insertion point. Delete removes the character 
to the right of the insertion point. When you hold down either of these keys, the 
characters will continue to be deleted until you release the key. You can also select 
characters, words, sentences, or paragraphs and then press Delete or Backspace to 
delete the selected text.
By default, Word enters text in a document using Insert mode. In Insert mode, 
when you enter new text in front of existing text, the existing text shifts to the right 
to make room for the new text. In Overtype mode, new text replaces the existing 
text. When Overtype mode is activated, Insert mode is turned off. You can activate 
Overtype mode in the Word Options dialog box, and you can use the Insert key to 
toggle Overtype mode on and off.

Undoing, Redoing, and Repeating
Sometimes you may delete or replace text unintentionally. Whenever you perform 
an action that you want to reverse, you can use the Undo command. If you undo 
an action and then change your mind, you can reverse the undo action by using the 
Redo command. You can even undo and redo multiple actions at one time.
There may be times when you want to repeat your last action. For example, you 
may enter new text in a document and then want to add the same text in other loca-
tions in the document. You can use the Repeat command to repeat your last action. 
The Undo, Redo, and Repeat buttons can be accessed on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
When you undo an action, the Redo button exchanges with the Repeat button on the 
Quick Access Toolbar.
ScreenTips for the Undo, Redo, and Repeat buttons are conditional and 
will reflect your recent action. Sometimes an action cannot be reversed, and the 
ScreenTip for the Undo button displays Can’t Undo. If you cannot repeat the 
last action, the Repeat button is dimmed and the ScreenTip for the Repeat button  
displays Can’t Repeat.

Copying and Moving Text
Selected text can be copied or moved within a document and between documents. 
For example, you can copy text from an e-mail message to a Word document. There 
are several ways to copy and move text.
When you use the mouse to drag selected text from the existing location and 
then drop the selected text in a new location, it is called drag-and-drop editing. 
Drag-and-drop editing makes moving text quick and easy, especially when you are 
moving the text short distances. You simply drag selected text to the new location and 
then release the mouse button. You can also copy text using drag-and-drop editing. 
Hold down Ctrl as you drag, and the selected text will be copied instead of moved.
You can also use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to move and copy selected 
text. When you use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, Word uses a feature called 
the Clipboard. The Clipboard is a temporary storage place in your computer’s 
­memory. The Clipboard can store data of all Office types, and that data can be 
inserted into the same document, into other documents in the same application, or 
into files in other Office applications.
You send selected contents of your document to the Clipboard by using the Cut 
or Copy commands. When the Clipboard task pane is open, the Clipboard stores up 
to 24 items, which you can view by showing the Clipboard task pane. If you prefer, 
you can work with the Clipboard task pane open.
You can retrieve the contents of the Clipboard by using the Paste command. You 
can select any one of the items on the Clipboard and paste it, or you can paste all of 
the items at once. Pasting the contents of the Clipboard does not delete the contents 
from the Clipboard. Therefore, you can paste Clipboard items as many times as you 
want. However, when you turn off the computer, the Clipboard contents are erased.

Finding Text
Scrolling through a long document to locate a specific section of text is time con-
suming. The Find command makes locating text or formats easier and more efficient. 
The Find command can be accessed in the Navigation Pane to quickly identify all 
occurrences of the search words. By default, Word completes an incremental search. 
In an incremental search, as you begin typing the string of characters for which you 
want to search, Word highlights the matches for the character string in the document. 
As the search text is augmented, the matches in the document change.
You can further define the search to find matches for whole words only, or you 
can search for all occurrences of a specific format in the document, such as all text 
formatted bold and italic. If you are looking for variations of text, you can use a 
wildcard character, a keyboard character used to represent one or more characters 
in a search. The question mark (?) searches for a single character; the asterisk (*) 
searches for a string of characters. For example, when the search text is b?rn, matches  
could include barn, born, and burn. When the search text is ben*, the matches could 
include bend, bench, Benny, and bent.
Quick Tip
You can also access the Cut, 
Copy, and Paste commands by 
right-clicking the selected text 
and choosing the desired com-
mand in the shortcut menu that 
appears. The keyboard shortcut 
for Cut is Ctrl+X, for Copy it is 
Ctrl+C, and for Paste it is Ctrl+V.

Using the Proofing Tools
An accurate document makes a good impression. Word provides several proofing 
tools that can help you prepare an error-free document.
Automatically checking the spelling in a document can significantly reduce the 
amount of time you spend proofreading. When the Proofing option is enabled, as 
you enter text, Word checks the spelling of each word against its standard dictionary. 
If Word cannot find the word in its dictionary, it will underline the word with a wavy 
red line. This does not necessarily mean the word is misspelled. It simply means 
the word is not listed in Word’s dictionary. You can right-click the flagged words to 
access a shortcut menu to view suggestions for other spellings.
Good proofreading skills also include checking grammar. When you check the 
grammar in a document, you read for content and make sure each sentence makes 
sense. Options are also available to automatically check for grammar errors such as 
incomplete sentences, the wrong use of words, and capitalization and punctuation 
errors. Possible grammar errors are identified with a wavy blue line below a word, 
phrase, or sentence. Just like the spell checker, you can right-click the flagged words 
to access a shortcut menu to view suggestions for changes.
Quick Tip
The spelling and grammar 
­checkers are helpful tools, but 
you still need to have a good 
working knowledge of English 
grammar and spelling. The 
spelling and grammar checkers 
can identify a possible problem, 
but it is up to you to decide if a 
change is necessary.

that you chose to ignore, you can recheck the document.
It is common for people to make the same spelling or typing error over and 
over. For example, you may often enter hte instead of the. The AutoCorrect ­feature 
automatically corrects errors as you enter text, which saves editing time. The 
AutoComplete feature suggests the spelling for frequently used words and phrases. 
For example, as you begin to enter the day of the week or the month, AutoComplete 
provides an option for completing the word for you.

Formatting Documents
When you format a document, you change the appearance of the text or of the whole 
document. The formats and design elements used in a document should reflect the 
purpose of the document and the needs of the reader. Formats can be applied either 
before or after you enter text in a document.
Word offers a number of formats, including character formats, paragraph formats, 
and document formats:
n 
Font styles, text color, and underline are examples of character formats. You 
can apply more than one character format at a time. For example, you can apply 
both color and underline formats to characters.
n 
A paragraph format is applied to an entire paragraph and cannot be applied to 
only a portion of a paragraph. For example, you cannot single space part of a 
paragraph and double space the rest. Word defines a paragraph as any amount of 
text that ends with a paragraph marker. A paragraph marker is inserted by press-
ing Enter, which creates a manual line break. When you create a manual line 
break, the new paragraph will include the same paragraph formats as the previ-
ous paragraph. Paragraph formats include alignment (how the text is positioned 
between the left and right margins), tabs, and line spacing.
n 
Document formats apply to an entire document. For example, paper size and 
margins, the blank spaces around the edges of the page, are document formats. 
You can position the insertion point anywhere in a document to change the 
entire document format.

Module 2  Key Applications
Applying Character Formats
Changing the character format can actually make a document easier to read. A font 
is the design of the typeface in your document. Fonts are available in a variety of 
styles and sizes, and you can use multiple fonts in one document. The size of the font 
is measured in points. The larger the point number, the larger the font size. You can 
quickly change the appearance of the font by using the command buttons in the Font 
group on the HOME tab. When you open the Font dialog box, more font options are 
available, and you can make several font changes at one time.
Changing the character format can also set the tone for a document. Consider 
the purpose of the document when you apply character design elements. While for-
matting text in all caps can draw the reader’s attention, it can also send the wrong 
message. Some readers may feel text in all caps means that you are yelling at them. 
Although some font styles and font colors may make the text look pretty or cool, 
they may also make it harder to read the text.

Applying Paragraph Formats
Changing the paragraph formats can also make the document more attractive and 
easier to read. Paragraph formats include adjusting the blank space between lines of 
text, aligning text, setting tabs and indents, and adding bullets and numbering. Most 
of the paragraph formats can be applied using the command buttons in the Paragraph 
group on the HOME tab.
The default line spacing in Word is single spacing. When text is double-spaced, 
there is a blank line between each line of text, which makes it easier to read. Many 
reports are formatted with double line spacing. You can also adjust the spacing both 
before and after the paragraph, which is common in newsletters to help to save space 
on a page or to make a headline stand out.
Alignment refers to how text is positioned between the left and right margins. 
Text can be aligned in four different ways: left, center, right, or justified. When the 
justified alignment is applied, the text is aligned at both the left and right margins and

Setting Tabs and Indents
Tabs are useful for indenting paragraphs and lining up columns of text. Word’s 
default tabs are set at every half inch. You can, however, set custom tabs at other 
locations. There are four alignment options and a vertical bar for tabs. Table 13–2 
describes each of the options.
Table 13–2  Options for tab settings
TAB SETTING
DESCRIPTION
 Left tab
This is the default tab style. When you begin to 
enter text at the tab, the text is aligned on the left 
and extends to the right.
 Center tab
Text is aligned evenly on either side of the tab 
position.
 Right tab
Text is aligned on the right and extends to the left.
 Decimal tab
Numbers with decimals are all aligned at the decimal  
point, and text aligns on either side of the tab. A 
decimal tab can be used to align numbers or text.
 Bar tab
This setting does not position the text, but a 
vertical bar is displayed in the paragraph at the 
tab position. If the tab is formatted for multiple 
paragraphs, the vertical bar is displayed in all 
the paragraphs to create a vertical line along the 
column of text or numbers.

An indent is a space inserted between the margin and where the line of text 
appears. You can indent text from the left margin, from the right margin, or from 
both the left and right margins. For example, to draw attention to specific paragraphs 
in a document, you can indent all the lines of the paragraph from the left and right 
margins. To make a long document with several paragraphs easier to read, you can 
format a first line indent. In a first line indent, the first line of each paragraph is 
indented, making it easy for the reader to tell where a new paragraph begins. When 
creating a bibliography for a report, you need to format a hanging indent, where the 
first line of text begins at the left margin, and all other lines of the paragraph hang, or 
are indented, to the right of the first line.
The ruler, which is available from the Show group on the VIEW tab, can be used 
to quickly set tabs, indents, and margins in your document. The ruler is also a handy 
reference to see the “true” size of your text and document.

Formatting Bullets and Numbers
Bullets are used to list items when order does not matter—an unordered list. 
Numbered lists are used to identify steps that should be completed in a specific order, 
which are often referred to as an ordered list. Bulleted and numbered lists are auto-
matically formatted with a hanging indent. Word automatically calculates the best 
distance for the hanging indent. You can change the bullet symbol, the number style, 
or the distance for the hanging indent in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
When you press Enter to create a new paragraph, the new paragraph will include the 
same paragraph formats as the previous paragraph.

Applying Document Formats
Document formats are applied to an entire document. These formats include layout 
settings such as margins, page orientation, paper size, and page breaks; you will look 
at adjusting these settings in this lesson. More document formats will be covered in 
Lesson 16. Most of the document formats can be accessed in the Page Setup group 
on the PAGE LAYOUT tab.
The margin and page orientation formats you choose should be based on the 
purpose and content of the document and also on the paper size. If you want more or 
less content to fit on a page, you can modify the margin settings. The default ­margin 
settings are one inch for top, bottom, left, and right margins, but you can easily 
change those settings.

Portrait orientation formats the content of the document with the short edge of the 
page at the top. This is the default setting. You can change to landscape ­orientation, 
which formats the content of the document with the long edge of the page at the top. 
Your on-screen document accurately reflects the page orientation you choose.
When you fill a page with text or graphics, Word automatically begins a new 
page by inserting a soft page break. You can also break pages manually by inserting 
a manual page break, which forces a page break at a specific location, regardless of 
how much text or how many graphics are on the page. The location of a soft page 
break will change when you add or delete text so that each page remains completely 
filled with text. A manual page break will remain where you insert it until it is deleted.
In Print Layout, Outline, and Draft views, the page break is indicated with a dot-
ted line across the page. In Read Mode view the dotted line does not appear, but the 
pages actually look like separate sheets of paper, so you will clearly see where page 
breaks are located. In Web Layout view, the document is usually displayed as one 
long page without page breaks.

Lesson 13  Editing and Formatting Documents	
Mod2-99
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
When you add text while in Insert mode, the new characters 
are inserted between existing text. When text is entered in 
Overtype mode, the new text replaces existing text.
n 
The Undo, Redo, and Repeat commands make editing easy 
when you make mistakes, change your mind, or repeat actions.
n 
Selected text can be copied or moved from one location in a 
Word document to a new location in the same document, to a 
different Word document, or to another application.
n 
When you use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, Word 
stores the selected text on the Clipboard.
n 
The Find command and the Navigation Pane make searching 
for text easy and efficient. The Replace command can replace 
multiple occurrences of search text automatically.
n 
Options can be enabled so that Word checks spelling and gram-
mar as you enter text.
n 
Font styles, text color, and underline are examples of character 
formats, and you can apply multiple character formats at the 
same time.
n 
Formatting a paragraph for left, center, right, or justified align-
ment positions the text appropriately between the left and right 
margins.
n 
You can use the ruler to format tabs and indents.
n 
The Bullets and Numbering feature automatically adds and 
formats bullets and numbers in lists.
n 
The page orientation determines how the document is printed 
on the page. Adjusting the margins affects the blank space 
around the edges of the page.

Lesson 13  Editing and Formatting Documents	
Mod2-103
  Teamwork Project
The fonts you use to format a document can be divided into two 
types: serif and sans serif. Research these two types of fonts to learn 
more about them.
	 1.	 Choose a partner and together research serif typefaces and sans 
serif typefaces. Use the Web or other references to read about 
typography, the art of designing typefaces.
	 2.	 When you and your partner have completed your research, 
work with your partner to create a summary of your findings.
	 3.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as  
TP 13–1, followed by your initials.
	 4.	 Type your answers to the following questions in separate 
paragraphs:
	a.	
What is a serif?
	b.	
What is the main difference between a serif font and a 
sans serif font?
	c.	
What type of typeface is recommended for body text? 
Why?
	 5.	 After answering each of the questions, select two 
different portions of the text in the document 
(such as the title or a paragraph with the answer to 
a question) and apply a serif font to one portion and a sans serif 
font to the other selected text.
	 6.	 With your partner, compare the different fonts that you have 
applied and decide which of the fonts is most readable and 
appropriate for each section of text.
	 7.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.

You have been copying multiple items to the Clipboard. 
You learned in this lesson that after you open the 
Clipboard pane, it stores multiple items. You can 
automatically copy items to the Clipboard without displaying the 
Clipboard task pane. Use the Help feature to learn how to do this.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as  
CT 13–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Write a paragraph describing how you can automatically  
copy items to the Clipboard without opening the Clipboard 
task pane.
	 3.	 Write a second paragraph explaining whether you would use 
this feature and why.
	 4.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.
Critical Thinking 13–2
If you completed Project 13–4, you had to add blank 
lines to center the text vertically on the first page of the 
Recreation Programs document. There is another way 
to center text vertically. Use Word’s Help feature to find out how to 
do this.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as  
CT 13–2, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Write a brief explanation of the steps you need to take. 
Explain what would happen to the second page of the Revised 
Recreation Programs Guide document if you followed  
these steps.
	 3.	 Describe at least two other types of documents in which you 
could use this feature.

Module 2  Key Applications
  Online Discovery
Selecting and copying text on a Web page is often similar to select-
ing and copying text in a Word document. Depending on the 
browser, you can usually select, copy, and paste Web page content 
just as you do in Word.
	 1.	 In your browser of choice, open a Web page that shows an arti-
cle with several paragraphs of text.
	 2.	 Refer to Table 13–1, and test all the select text options listed 
in the table, noting whether or not each option works to select 
text in the Web page.
	 3.	 Create a new Word document, and save the docu-
ment as OD 13–1, followed by your initials.
	 4.	 Test copying text from the Web page and then 
pasting the copied text into the Word document. 
Delete the pasted content.
	 5.	 Write a brief summary describing what is similar when select-
ing and copying text in Word and in a browser.
	 6.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.

  Job Skills
In this lesson you learned to use the proofing tools to help you avoid 
spelling and grammar errors. Although these features are very help-
ful, you cannot rely on them to find all errors. You have just pre-
pared a news release for your manager, but before you give your 
manager access to the document, you want to make sure there are no 
errors in the document.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as  
JS 13–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Create a list of steps you will take to proofread the document.
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.
  explore and solve
In this lesson you learned to use tab stops to format the text align-
ment. Explore the options for formatting the space between tabs with 
“leader” characters (dots and dashes) to help line up information.
	 1.	 Open Revised Recreation Programs from your solution files. 
Save the Revised Recreation Programs document as ES 13–1, 
followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Toggle off the underline format for the three age 
group headings.
	 3.	 Change the format of the tabs so that leader char-
acters appear between the tabs. Be creative and use 
different leaders for the tabs.
	 4.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.

Module 2  Key Applications
The development of a document may involve multiple team members. If you 
­collaborate with others to create or edit a document, you can take advantage of many 
features in Word that help individuals contribute more effectively to the development 
of the document.
Revising Documents
In a team effort to create a document, it is common to allow team members to review 
and edit the document. Tracking changes with revision marks makes it easy to find 
edits and identify the source of the edits. Adding comments is another useful feature 
that allows reviewers to provide feedback and express opinions without changing 
the content of the document. The revision marks and annotations that appear in a 
document are referred to as markup.
Tracking Changes
When the Track Changes feature is toggled on, all insertions, deletions, and for-
mat changes are indicated with revision marks such as a change in font color, 
­underlines, strikethrough formats, and balloons in the margins. These revision 
marks are easy to recognize, and they even identify who made the changes and 
when the changes were made.
Step-by-Step 14.1
	 1.	 Start Word. Open the Workstations file from the drive and folder where 
your Data Files folder is stored. Save the Workstations document as 
Revised Workstations 1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Confirm that the document is displayed in Print Layout view. Click the 
REVIEW tab. If necessary, in the Tracking group, click the Display for 
Review list arrow and then select Simple Markup. Also, if necessary,

Showing and Hiding Markup
Multiple comments and revisions often clutter the document and make it difficult 
to read the content. Moreover, if there are multiple users, the revisions may be 
even more complex to review. As you have already learned, in addition to choosing 
Simple Markup or All Markup settings, you can further customize the markup view 
by choosing from several options to show the markup. For example, you can choose 
to show only the edits from a specific reviewer, or you can choose to view only the 
comments added to the document. To see what the final document will look like, you 
can hide the entire markup.
There is no limit on the number of reviewers for a document. Word will assign 
a different color for each of the first eight reviewers. The colors will be reused for 
additional reviewers beyond the first eight. You can still easily identify reviewers by 
their user names in the markup ScreenTips.
Step-by-Step 14.3
	 1.	 If necessary, open the Revised Workstations 2 file from your solution 
files. If necessary, click the REVIEW tab.
	 2.	 In the Tracking group, click the Show Markup button. A menu appears, 
and you can choose the type of revisions you want to review. All types 
of markup with a check mark will be displayed in the document. Point 
to Specific People to show the names of the reviewers, as shown in 
Figure 14–11.
	 3.	 Click Reviewer A to uncheck that reviewer name. Scroll through the 
document. Now only the changes and comments from the first reviewer 
are displayed in the document.

	 5.	 In the Tracking group click the Display for Review list arrow, and then 
click No Markup. The document is displayed on the screen exactly as 
it will print, with all the revisions accepted and the comments hidden. 
The markup has not been accepted or removed from the document; it

	 7.	 Leave the document open for the next Step-by-Step.
Accepting and Rejecting Changes and Responding to 
Comments
After changes and comments are added to a document, the edited document is 
­usually passed on to another person, either the original author or another reviewer, to 
make a decision about the revisions and comments. That person can decide whether 
to accept or reject the changes, and he or she can also remove the comments from 
the document. The Next and Previous buttons in the Comments group help you 
quickly navigate through the comments in the document. You can mark a comment 
as “Done,” reply to the comment, or delete the comment.
When the edits are complete, you can apply a Marked as Final status. Then 
when you share the document, those who review the document will know they are 
viewing the final version. When a document is marked as final, editing is disabled 
and markup is not visible. The file becomes a read-only document, which permits 
others to open and view the document, but they are unable to make any changes to 
the document. Be aware, however, that it is possible for anyone to easily remove the 
Marked as Final status.
Step-by-Step 14.4
	 1.	 If necessary, open the Revised Workstations 2 file from your ­solution files. 
Save the Revised Workstations 2 document as Revised Workstations 3,

ment remains in the document but now appears in a dim grey font.

Preparing a Document for Printing
After the document is finalized, you can prepare a hard copy—a printed copy— 
of the document to share the information. Often, multiple copies are prepared and 
distributed. Your system may have two or more printers available, including inkjet 
printers, laser printers, fax programs that also serve as a type of printer, and others. 
The benefit of having more than one printer to choose from is that different printers 
offer different features.
Printing a Document
When you click the FILE tab and then click Print, the print settings are displayed in 
Backstage view. When you click the Print command at the top of the middle pane, 
the content in the active window or document is sent directly to the printer, and 
you will not have the opportunity to change the printing options or printer settings. 
The default printer options will be applied. If your computer accesses more than 
one printer, you will want to select the printer you want to use. You can specify the 
number of copies and the range of pages to print. You can also change the printer 
settings (such as print quality or the color settings using the Printer Properties link). 
The options will vary, but most of the print options are similar for all applications. 
In addition to the print settings, a preview of the print layout is displayed in a pane 
on the right. If the document has multiple pages, you can use the Previous Page and 
Next Page buttons to preview each page.

Customizing Print Settings and Properties and 
Showing the Print Queue
Many people use their default printer settings, and they are not aware of all the 
additional features and options that are available. Most printers have settings for 
adjusting the printing speed and the print quality. When working with multipage 
documents, special features such as reverse printing, collating, and duplex printing 
are very useful. Reverse printing reverses the order of the pages so the last page 
prints first. When enabled, the collating setting prints all of the pages in one copy 
of the document before printing the next copy so that the printed pages are auto-
matically arranged in the proper order. Duplex printing is printing on both sides of 
the page. Of course, you can manually feed the paper back into the printer to print 
the back side of the page, but it is very convenient when the printer will do that 
automatically.
The print queue shows information about print jobs that are waiting to print. 
When you open the print queue, you can see the sequence of the active documents, 
the document owner, and the number of pages to print. In addition to viewing the 
status and information about the waiting print jobs, you can also use the print queue 
to pause, resume, restart, or cancel print jobs.

Maintain Integrity when Sharing Documents
Computer use is a privilege, and it imposes certain obligations and responsibilities. The behavior, courtesy, 
and etiquette expected in verbal and written communications is extended to electronic communications. 
When sharing documents, users must maintain integrity and discipline themselves to do what is right. It is 
important that shared documents are maintained in a manner that is accurate and honest.
Only view and edit the files you are authorized to access. Do not move, alter, or delete documents 
without permission. Respect the property of others. The use of the documents should be limited to the 
intended objectives, and release of information without permission is unethical. Passwords are used 
to restrict access, so do not share passwords with those who are not authorized to access the files. 
To ­protect confidential information, remove metadata, and follow the correct procedures to keep the 
information secure.

Troubleshooting Common Printing Problems
Even when you preview the pages in Backstage view, there are times when the print 
results do not meet expectations. This could be for a variety of reasons, as shown in 
Table 14–2.
2-1.1.4
Table 14–2  Troubleshooting printer problems
PROBLEM
CAUSE/SOLUTION
The entire document does not print, or some of 
the document looks blurry and faded.
If the colors do not print correctly, the printer may be 
low on, or out of ink or toner.
The document does not look the same as what 
you see on the screen.
Sometimes the font in your document might not be 
available on the printer you are using. Change the font 
in your document to a TrueType font, which looks the 
same on the printed page as it does on the screen, or 
change the font to one that is available on your printer.
The layout looks wrong.
You may be printing a document that was created with 
a different version of Word or was formatted for differ-
ent printer settings, such as margins and paper size.
Some printers will not print documents with margins 
less than 0.5".
To have Word format the document to your printer’s 
paper size for this printing session only, open the Print 
dialog box and then show the printer properties. Choose 
the appropriate paper size, and scale the document to 
fit the paper size.
Nothing happens.
Check the print queue. Your document may be blocked 
by one or more documents waiting to be printed.
Make sure the printer is not out of paper.
Make sure the printer is connected to the computer, 
the printer power is turned on, and the printer is 
online.
Make sure the printer cable is connected to the right port.
Check for paper jams.
Open the Print dialog box and confirm that the correct 
printer is shown in the Printer name text box.
Run the Windows Printing Troubleshooter. Click the 
Start button, and then click Help and Support. In the 
Search box, enter the keywords printing troubleshooter, 
and then select the problem(s) you are having and 
­follow the instructions.
You do not get a printed document, and Microsoft 
Word itself stops responding.
It is likely that the printer driver is not installed or you do 
not have the correct printer driver. You can try installing 
an updated printer driver from the printer’s manufacturer.

Sharing Documents
The use of computers and telecommunications in the workplace has changed how 
we work. The majority of the information we work with is now generated by e-mail 
and electronic files. Instead of producing a hard copy of a document, it is now com-
mon practice to share a soft copy. A soft copy is a digital copy of data, such as a file 
viewed on a computer’s display or shared via an e-mail attachment.
Preparing Documents for Electronic Distribution
You may want to control what others can see in the document. For example, you 
may not want them to see the author of the document or the date the document was 
created. Information like this is referred to as metadata—data that describes other 
data—and it is still easy to find. Much of this information is automatically updated, 
and you can remove or manually change some of the information.

Saving the Document in a PDF or XPS Format
When sharing documents with others, you need to consider that not all users will be 
using Word 2013. Before distributing the soft copy of a document, you may need to 
save it in a format that enables those working with different applications, platforms, 
and operating systems to access the file.
The Portable Document Format (PDF), created by Adobe Systems in 1993, is 
commonly used. To open files in the PDF format, Adobe Reader software must be 
installed on the computer. Microsoft first included the XML Paper Specification 
(XPS) format in the Office 2007 applications. To open files in XPS format, you must 
use Microsoft’s XPS Viewer, which is installed by default in Office 2013 applica-
tions. Both PDF and XPS formats are designed to preserve the visual appearance 
and layout of each page, and they enable fast viewing and printing. These document 
formats are especially useful for resumes and newsletters because the appearance 
and printing of the document will be exactly as intended.

To edit a PDF document you must have a specific type of software. However, you 
can open a PDF file in Word and edit the contents. When Word converts the PDF 
file content into a Word document, the results may not look exactly like the original 
PDF document, and some formatting may be lost during the process, especially if 
the PDF document contains graphics.
After editing the contents, you can re-save the file in PDF format. To save 
the document in PDF format, you can use the Export command as you did in the 
­previous Step-by-Step, or you can change the file format in the Save As dialog box, 
as you will do in the following Step-by-Step.

Above and Beyond
SkyDrive Pro is a service available 
to business users who subscribe 
to Office 365 and Windows 
SharePoint Online accounts. 
SkyDrive Pro provides tools for 
sharing and updating files and 
keeping colleagues informed 
about document status. Users can 
publish the document at the Web 
site and keep the local document 
on your computer synchronized 
with the changes and updates. 
The organization administrator 
controls the access to documents 
and the rights of users.
Sharing and Publishing Documents
A convenient way to share a document is to upload the document to the Cloud, a 
network where files are uploaded to a library on the Internet. Office 2013 makes 
it easy to upload documents to the Cloud using your Microsoft account to access a 
SkyDrive account, a free, online library space for storing and sharing files. You can 
use SkyDrive to store files such as documents, photos, music, videos, and notes. 
When you upload a file to the Cloud, you can choose whether or not to share the file 
with others. You can e-mail the file, create a link to the file in a text message, post 
the file on a social network or a Web page, or publish the file to a blog. If you’re part 
of a group working on a document, group members can access the document at the 
same time. Then you and those with whom you choose to share the file can access 
the file from multiple devices, including your computer or table and phone, and edit 
and save changes to the document.
You can also share a document by attaching the document to an e-mail message. 
You can choose to save the attached document in either a PDF or an XPS file format. 
You can also send a link to the current document in an e-mail message. If you have 
a fax service provider, you can send the document as an Internet fax, without using 
a fax machine.
When signed into your Microsoft Account, you can share a document by pre-
senting the document online. This new feature in Word enables you to upload the 
document to the Cloud and then create a link and invite others so they can join the 
presentation and review the document.
A blog (an abbreviated version of the term Web log) is a journal maintained by 
an individual or a group and posted on a Web site for public viewing and comment. 
Blogs are often referred to as online diaries, and they may include graphics, photos, 
music, video, and links to Web sites. A typical blog Web site provides links and

Protecting Documents
If a document contains important or confidential information, you need secure ways 
to share the information. Word offers features that enable you to control sensitive 
information and collaborate in confidence.
Restricting Access
The most secure option is to encrypt the document. Encryption is a standard method 
for encoding data. During the process of encryption, a password is assigned, and 
then all users must enter the password to open the document. If you want to permit 
some users to modify the encrypted document, you can create a second password 
that will allow them to edit and save changes to the document. This option limits 
those who can edit the document.
It is recommended that passwords include a combination of text, numbers, and 
symbols and be at least eight characters in length—the more characters the better. 
Passwords are case sensitive, which means when entering a password, the upper- 
and lowercasing of the letters must be identical to the casing of the letters in the 
assigned password.
Quick Tip
People often choose to use 
nicknames or commonly used 
words for their passwords, such 
as wildcats because they are easy 
to remember. To create a stronger 
password with a combination 
of text, numbers, and symbols, 
replace the vowels with numbers 
and/or symbols. For example: 
W1ldc1ts!.

Warning
If you forget the password, the 
file cannot be reopened. When 
you assign a password to a 
document, write it down and 
keep the note in a secure place.

  Online Discovery 
For several months you have been researching your ancestry, and 
you would like to share your research data with family members. 
You plan to e-mail your summary document to all your family 
members, including grandparents and cousins. Before you send the 
document you decide to save it in the PDF format for platform neu-
trality. However, to open the file, the recipients must have either 
Word 2013 or Adobe Reader installed on their computer.
	 1.	 Search the Internet for the Adobe Web site and 
navigate to the Web page where you can find 
information about downloading the Adobe Reader 
application.
	 2.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as

  Job Skills 
You share a printer in your work environment and you sent a docu-
ment to the printer, but the document never printed. You check the 
print queue and you see that a document ahead of yours has been 
paused, which is why your document has not printed. You recognize 
the name of the owner of the document. You’re in a hurry to get the 
hard copy of the document. What would you do?
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the docu-
ment as JS 14–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Write a brief paragraph explaining how you 
would handle this issue.
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.
  Critical Thinking
Critical Thinking 14–1
If the colors fade or are inconsistent when you print a 
page, it is possible that the printer is low on ink or toner. 
The cartridges are an additional expense, however, so 
you do not want to replace them until they are empty. So, how do 
you know the amount of ink or toner available in the cartridge(s)? 
Printers vary, and there is no universal answer for this question.
	 1.	 Explore the properties (or preferences) for the printer con-
nected to your computer to locate the estimated levels of ink or 
toner for your printer.
	 2.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 14–1, followed by your initials.
	 3.	 List the steps that describe how you can check the level of ink 
or toner for your printer.
	 4.	 Save the changes, and then close the document.
Critical Thinking 14–2
Further explore the properties for a printer connected 
to your computer. Identify one of the special features 
that interests you the most, such as printing posters, 
adjusting the volume of ink for faster drying time, or printing in 
grayscale.
	 1.	 Examine the feature and options, and use the Help screens to 
aid you in learning the purpose of the feature.
	 2.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 14–2, followed by your initials.
	 3.	 Write a short description about the feature, and explain when 
you would use this feature.
	 4.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close the document.

Mod2-148	
Module 2  Key Applications
Suppose you have a document in Word that includes information you want to 
arrange in several lines across two or three columns. You create the columns you 
need in Word by setting tab stops. However, there is an easier and faster way. The 
table features in Word make the task of arranging text and numbers in columns both 
quick and easy. Borders and shading also help to organize information in a mean-
ingful way.
Creating a Table
A table consists of cells that you add content to, such as text, numbers, or graphics. 
A cell represents one intersection of a row and a column in a table. In a table, rows 
go across and columns go down. It is common to add headings at the top of columns 
to label the content in the columns. The first row in a table or data source with the 
column headings is referred to as the header row.
To create a table, you must first decide how many columns and rows you want 
in the table. You then create a table grid and enter the data in the cells. To move the 
insertion point from one cell to another, you can press the Tab key or the arrow keys. 
When you reach the end of a row and press Tab, the insertion point moves to the first 
cell in the next row.

Adjusting Column Width and Row Height
When you create a table grid, Word makes all the columns the same width, and the 
entire width of the table is based on the current settings for the margins and paper 
size. You can choose to automatically adjust the width of one or more columns to 
accommodate the contents within the cells, or you can automatically adjust all col-
umn widths at the same time. You can also choose to automatically resize the table 
to fit in the document window. This is useful because the table width then automati-
cally adjusts when the window size changes.
When the table is first inserted, the height of each row is the same, but when 
the text wraps to a second line within a cell, the height of all the cells in that row is 
automatically increased to accommodate the extra line of text.
Step-by-Step 15.4
	 1.	 If necessary, open the Calories 3 file from your solution files. Save the 
Calories 3 document as Calories 4, followed by your initials. If neces-
sary, switch to Print Layout view.

Merging and Splitting Table Cells
When you remove the boundary between two cells, it is called merging cells. You 
can merge cells horizontally or vertically. You can merge cells when you want to 
­create a heading to span across two or more columns.
When you convert a cell into multiple cells, it is called splitting cells. You can 
split a cell into two or more rows and/or two or more columns. You can also split a 
table into two separate tables.

Drawing a Table
There may be occasions when you need to create and customize a more complex 
table. For example, the table may require cells of different heights or a varying num-
ber of columns per row. The Draw Table tool is very useful for creating complex 
tables. The Draw Table tool enables you to use the mouse to draw the table grid on 
the screen, the same way you would use a pen to draw the grid on a sheet of paper. 
When you use the Draw Table tool, the document must be displayed in Print Layout 
view. The Table Eraser tool enables you to remove cell boundaries from a table.
Quick Tip
You can also use the Draw Table 
tool and the Eraser tool to add, 
delete, split, and merge cells in 
an existing table.

Formatting Tables
You can make a table easier to read by enhancing its appearance. For example, align-
ing numbers within a cell can make the data easier to read. Changing the border 
colors and adding shading to some of the cells can help the reader quickly identify 
different types of data.

Formatting Borders and Shading
As you worked with the Calories and Recycle tables you created in this lesson, 
the lines you saw on the screen were actually borders. By default, Word formats a 
½-point single-line border around all cells in a table. Generally, the default border 
is appropriate for the tables you create. However, there may be occasions when you 
want to customize the border and add shading or color to some of the table cells. You 
may even want to remove the border completely. When you remove the borders from 
table cells, the boundary lines for the cells still remain. These boundary lines in a 
table are called gridlines. Gridlines are used for layout purposes so you can see the 
cell boundaries as you work with the table. Gridlines are displayed on the screen, but 
they do not print.

to the default settings.
Applying Table Styles
As you can see, formatting borders and shading can take time. That is why Word 
provides several table designs that enable you to apply multiple table formats with 
a single click. These styles are referred to as built-in styles, and the styles include 
formats for fonts, shading, and borders.
Some table styles include shading formats for banded rows and/or banded 
­columns in which even-numbered rows are formatted differently than odd-numbered 
rows. The shading applied to alternate rows and/or columns enhances the readability 
of the table data.

Using Quick Tables
Word also provides built-in tables called Quick Tables that include a table grid with 
sample data and table formats. To save time creating a table, you insert a Quick Table 
in a document and then you replace the sample data with your own data. You can 
modify the table structure and styles as needed.
Editing text in the cells of a table is a similar process to entering text in a docu-
ment. You can enter and delete text, or select and replace the text. The Cut, Copy, and 
Paste commands are available, and you can also use drag-and-drop editing.
When you show nonprinting characters, you can see that every row ends with a 
marker. When copying, cutting and pasting, or moving entire rows, these end-of-row 
markers must be included in the selection for the entire row to be selected.

Sorting Data in a Table
Tables organize material to make it easier to read, and you have discovered how 
formatting the table and the characters in the table can add clarity to the information. 
You can also sort the information in a table on different search criteria to organize 
the table contents to change the emphasis of the data.
Sorting data in ascending order rearranges it into alphabetical order from 
A to Z, or numerical order from lowest number to highest number. Sorting data in 
descending order rearranges the data in alphabetical order from Z to A, or numerical 
order from highest number to lowest number. When using default settings, header 
rows are not included when the data is sorted.

Converting Text to a Table and 
a Table to Text
Assume that you have already created a multicolumn list using tab settings. You 
decide that you want to organize the data in a table because it will be easier to for-
mat. In Word, it is not necessary to enter all the data again. Word can quickly convert 
text separated by paragraph markers, commas, tabs, or other characters into a table 
with cells.
When converting text to a table, Word determines the number of columns needed 
based on paragraph markers, tabs, or commas, or other characters in the text. Word 
also provides a command to convert a table to text. When converting a table to text, 
Word inserts paragraph markers, tabs, commas, or other characters to indicate the 
column breaks, and you can choose which symbols or characters to use to indicate 
the column breaks.

Internet Fraud
Internet fraud refers to any type of scam or hoax that uses one or more components of the Internet, such 
as e-mail, blogs, or Web sites. The most common types of Internet fraud are auction and retail schemes, 
business opportunities and work-at-home schemes, identity theft, investment schemes, and credit or debit 
card fraud. Internet fraud is a federal crime. If you think you have been the victim of Internet fraud, you 
can file a complaint online at the FBI Web site, www.fbi.gov.
White-collar crime refers to a full range of frauds committed by business and government profes-
sionals, and Internet fraud is one of the white-collar crimes that the FBI investigates. The Internet Crime 
Complaint Center (or IC3) is a partnership of the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center.

Lesson 15  Working with Tables	
Mod2-175
SUMMARY
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
The table feature in Word enables you to organize and arrange 
text and numbers easily.
n 
To change the layout of information after you create a table, 
you can insert and delete rows and columns. The AutoFit fea-
ture automatically adjusts the width of a column based on the 
contents of the cells in a column.
n 
The Draw Table tool and the Eraser tool are especially useful 
when you need to create a complex table.
n 
You can format text alignment in table cells the same way you 
apply those formats in other Word documents.
n 
Borders and shading greatly enhance the appearance of a table 
and often make the table easier to read. Word provides several 
built-in styles to make it fast and easy to apply borders and 
shading to a table.
n 
Word provides Quick Tables that are already formatted and 
contain sample data, so you can quickly create a table.
n 
You can copy, cut, paste, and move contents within a table.
n 
You can use the Sort feature to reorganize the table contents to 
emphasize data in different ways.
n 
Word can convert text to a table and vice versa.

If you completed Project 15–2, you created a table to organize 
information about costly hurricanes because of property damage. 
The data shown in the Hurricane History table was compiled from 
several sources by the National Weather Service and is current only 
through 2008. You have probably heard about several powerful and 
costly hurricanes in the United States. With a partner, find data to 
update the table with more recent statistics.
	 1.	 Create a list of the years from 2008 to the last complete hur-
ricane season (hurricane season begins in June and ends in 
November, so if you are working on this project before the end 
of November, do not include the current year in your list).
	 2.	 Split the years with your partner so you each have half of them 
to research.
	 3.	 Using Web search tools or other research tools, try to locate a 
summary of hurricane damage for each year.
	 4.	 Open the Revised Historical Hurricanes file 
from your solution files, and save the document as 
TP 15–1, followed by your initials.
	 5.	 If any of the years you research total more dollar 
damage than the hurricanes already listed in the Revised 
Hurricane History table, insert new rows to add the data you 
have found.
	 6.	 When you have compiled the data, experiment with sorting 
the rows using different criteria and applying different for-
mats to the header row, borders, cells, and text.
	 7.	 With your partner, decide which format presents the data the 
way you prefer, and then add your names and the current date 
to the bottom of the document page.

If you have ever created a resume, you know how difficult it can be 
to fit all your work history, educational information, and accom-
plishments on one page in an appealing format. Have you ever con-
sidered using a table grid to organize your information?
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
JS 15–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Apply a format that will automatically reference 
the column data when the table wraps to the next 
page. 
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document, and then close 
the document.
If your table has a lot of data, or if the table is positioned at the 
bottom of a page, the table rows can span to a new page. When the 
table rows span to the next page, it is difficult to identify the data in 
each of the columns. Search the Table Tools features to find a way 
to automatically reference the column data when the table spans to 
another page.

Module 2  Key Applications
When developing a document, you must keep in mind its purpose and the needs of 
the reader. By using appropriate design elements, you can publish a professional-
looking, effective document. Word provides a number of features to help you easily 
apply formats to enhance the appearance of the document.
Working with Document Templates
Every Microsoft Word document is based on a template, a file that affects the basic 
structure of a document and contains document settings such as fonts, line spacing, 
margins, and page layout. Using templates increases the speed and efficiency of your 
work since you do not need to spend time formatting page layouts and font formats. 
Templates also help you maintain consistency in the documents you create.
Word has two types of templates. A document template contains document 
settings, content, and formats that are available only to documents based on that 
template. A global template contains document settings that are available to all 
documents.
Word’s default global template, the Normal template, is the file Normal.dotm. 
When you open a new blank document, by default the Normal template provides 
predefined formats that are already part of the document, such as default settings that 
affect the page layout, margin settings, paragraph spacing, and font styles. Of course, 
as you work with a document you often change those default settings.
Create a New Document Based on a 
Document Template
Creating documents such as fax cover sheets, resumes, and invoices can be time-­
consuming tasks. Fortunately, Word has predesigned document templates for almost 
any purpose you can imagine. The document templates available are based on 
whether or not you have an Internet connection. Some of the document templates are 
already installed on your computer and thousands more are available at the Microsoft 
Web site Office.com.
Document templates are formatted for a specific purpose, and many of them 
already contain boilerplate text, content that you frequently use in a document 
for that purpose. For example, if you want to create a letter, you can select a letter 
­document template and create a new document based on that template. When the 
new document opens, the letter layout is already created, and the document contains 
boilerplate text such as the sender’s company name and address. You can edit the 
boilerplate text, or you can replace it or delete it.
Document templates often include fields that indicate a location in the docu-
ment to enter variable data such as the date. Placeholder text is displayed in the 
field and provides guidance for adding text or data to the field. When you click 
the placeholder text, all the placeholder text is selected, and as you type, the text or 
data you enter replaces the placeholder text. The field includes codes that automati-
cally format the text or data you enter. Some fields provide a list arrow, and when 
you click the arrow you can select field content from a predefined list. If you choose 
not to enter text or data into a field, you can delete the placeholder text so it no longer 
appears in the document.
Depending on the fields used in the document template, your name or initials 
may automatically be added to the document. If your name or initials are incorrect, 
you can enter new text. You can easily save a document as a new document template, 
and you can create a new document based on an existing document.

Quick Tip
The user name or initials auto-

template are set in Word Options. 
To change these settings, 
click the FILE tab, click Options, 
and then if necessary, in the left 
pane click General. If you are 
using a classroom computer, do 
not change the Word Options 
­settings without permission.
Quick Tip
To run Word, you must have a 
Normal template. If the Normal 
template is deleted, Word will 
create a new one using the 
­factory defaults.

plates available. To access more templates available online, you would 
search for key words or click a link for frequently-used categories under 
the Search box at the top of the Templates gallery.
	 3.	 Normally, you would click a thumbnail in the Templates gallery and then 
click Create to create a new document based on the document template. 
Instead of using a document template in the Word Template gallery, you 
will create a new document based on a document ­template from your 
Data Files. In the Navigation pane, click Open Other Documents and 
then navigate to the drive and folder where your Data Files folder is 
stored. Open the Itinerary Letter Template.dotm file.

To access some of the ­templates, 
you must purchase and ­download 
the Docstock app for Office 
before you can access the 
­template and edit the content. 
Also, some of the available 
templates include a Gift Pass 
price tag. When you create a 
new document based on these 
­templates, you can add a Gift 
Pass to your document and 
then send the Gift Pass directly 
from your computer. Then the

Using a Document Template to Create a Blog
A blog (an abbreviated version of the term “Web log”) is a journal maintained by 
an individual or a group and posted on a Web site for public viewing and comment. 
Blogs are often referred to as online diaries, and they may include graphics, photos, 
music, and video. A typical blog Web site provides links to other Web sites and 
enables instant feedback or commenting, and many blog hosts offer free blog post-
ing services. The Blog post template provides the necessary file formats so the blog 
entry content can be published on the Web. The advantage to posting the blog from 
a Word document is that you can use Word’s photo-editing tools, font formats, and 
spelling checker.
Completing the process of posting a blog is beyond the scope of this lesson 
because to post a blog from Word you must have an established and registered blog 
account with a Microsoft-enabled blog service provider. The following Step-by-Step 
provides information for those who are using the Blog Post feature for the first time 
and need to register a blog account. Once the registration is completed, you can use 
the Publish Blog Post command to post entries directly from a Word document.

Module 2  Key Applications
Working with Styles
Another way to quickly and easily change the appearance of document elements is 
to apply a style. A style is a set of formatting characteristics you can apply to char-
acters, paragraphs, tables, and numbered and bulleted lists. When you apply a style, 
you apply a whole group of formats in one simple step. For example, instead of 
­taking multiple steps to format your title as Arial, 14 point, bold, and center-aligned, 
you can achieve the same result in one step by applying a title style.
Using styles ensures consistency across multiple documents. Another advantage to 
formatting your document using styles is that when text is formatted with Word’s built-in 
heading styles you can view, organize, and edit the document content in Outline view.
Applying Styles and Modifying Style Formats
Styles are included in templates. When a template is attached to the document, you 
can access all the styles saved in the template. The Normal template contains a set 
of predefined styles that you can quickly access from the Quick Style gallery in the 
Styles group on the HOME tab. You can apply these styles and modify them. The 
style changes are applied only to the current document.
The styles provided in the Normal template include character, paragraph, and 
linked styles. The character styles provide text formats such as font name, font size, 
font color, bold, italic, underline, borders, and shading. The paragraph styles ­provide 
both text formats and paragraph formats such as line spacing, text alignment, indenta-
tion, and tab stops. Linked styles provide either text or paragraph formats, depending 
on the content that is selected when the style is applied. For example, when you select 
a word or phrase and then apply a linked style, just the text formats of the style are 
applied. On the other hand, when you click in a paragraph or select an entire para-
graph and then apply a linked style, both the text and paragraph formats are applied.

Using Building Blocks and Data Elements
Building blocks are built-in document parts that are already designed and format-
ted, enabling you to quickly create a professional-looking document. Word provides 
several built-in building blocks for frequently used text and document parts, such as 
predesigned cover pages, headers, footers, and page number formats. Not only do 
building blocks save you time, but they also ensure consistency in content and for-
mats. The built-in building blocks are stored in the Quick Parts gallery, and you can 
add your own custom building blocks to the gallery. After inserting building blocks 
in a document, you can customize the text or document parts.
Creating an effective, professional document also often requires inserting spe-
cial data elements such as footnotes or endnotes, dates and times, hyperlinks, and 
copyright and trademark symbols. Word provides quick access to tools that simplify 
the tasks for adding these elements.
Inserting Page Numbers and Creating Headers 
and Footers
Page numbers are always helpful when your document has multiple pages. When 
you insert page numbers in a document, the page number is displayed in a header or 
a footer. A header is information and/or a graphic that is printed in the top margin of 
the page; a footer is information and/or a graphic that is printed in the bottom margin 
of the page. Your document can have a header, a footer, both, or neither. The advan-
tage of formatting a header or footer rather than just inserting page numbers is that 
you can include text with the page number.

Inserting Footnotes and Endnotes
Notes are most commonly seen as references in reports. However, you can also 
add footnotes to documents to provide additional information or comments for the 
reader. Footnotes are inserted at the bottom of the page on which the note is refer-
enced in the document, and endnotes are placed together at the end of the document. 
Both kinds of notes are linked to an in-text reference symbol—usually a letter or 
numeral formatted with the superscript effect.

Creating and Editing Hyperlinks
A helpful tool on the INSERT tab is the Hyperlink button. Usually when you think 
of a hyperlink, you think about links to Web pages and e-mails. When you type 
URLs for Web pages and e-mail addresses, Word automatically creates a hyperlink. 
However, you can also create links to another location in the same document, to 
another Word document, or to a file in another application. To create a link to another 
location in the same document, the document content must be formatted with default 
heading styles or bookmarks.

Creating Your Own Building Blocks
It is likely that you often enter the same content to commonly prepared documents. 
For example, if you often include a legal disclaimer in documents, you can select the 
content you want to include (text, formatted text, and/or images), and then save the 
selected content as a Quick Part. Not only does creating your own building blocks 
save you time, it also ensures consistency and accuracy.
By default, custom Quick Parts are stored in a special template named Building 
Blocks.dotx, where all the built-in building blocks are stored. Because you may 
share your computer with classmates, the Quick Parts that you create in this lesson 
will be removed from the Quick Part Gallery when you complete the Step-by-Step.

Dress for Success
Regardless of your employment level or career path, to be effective and project a professional and compe-
tent image at work, you need to dress for success. Dressing appropriately will help you gain respect and 
establish credibility on the job. Every business has its own style, each position has its own status, and 
workers dress differently for the activities involved in their work. If your employer provides a written dress 
code, be sure to follow the rules. Many employers, however, do not have established dress standards, so 
you have to get it right on your own. If in doubt, dress like your boss, or ask a superior for advice.

Module 2  Key Applications
Word provides a number of features to add visual interest to documents. The features 
help you emphasize the content and create an attractive and professional document.
Formatting Columns, Borders, and Shading
Desktop publishing is the process of creating a document using a computer to lay 
out text and graphics. One common example of desktop publishing is newsletters. 
Newsletter text is often formatted in multiple columns with headings, borders, shading, 
and pictures are often included. All of these enhancements make the articles more 
appealing and easier to read.
Formatting Text in Columns
A section is an area within a document that can have its own separate page formats 
such as the page orientation, margins, and the number of columns. When you create a 
new blank document in Word, the document consists of just one section. If you want 
to change the page formats for one portion of the document you must divide the 
document into multiple sections by creating a section break. A section break con-
trols the section formatting of the text that precedes it. After dividing the document 
into multiple sections, you can apply different formats in each section.
By default, all the text you enter in a Word document will be displayed in a 
single column, approximately six inches wide. Formatting text to display it in mul-
tiple columns sometimes saves space on a page, and because the width of the line of 
text is smaller, the text is often easier to read. Word provides several multicolumn 
formats, and you can modify these formats to meet your needs. Oftentimes, column 
headings are formatted as a single-column banner, which is a headline that spreads 
the full width of the page. When you format text in columns, the columns are usually 
balanced so the column heights are approximately equal. There may be occasions, 
however, when you want to control where text breaks from one column to the next. 
To adjust where a column ends, you can insert a manual column break.
Step-by-Step 17.1
	 1.	 Open the Newsletter file from the drive and folder where your Data Files 
folder is stored. Save the Newsletter document as Revised Newsletter 1, 
followed by your initials. If necessary, display nonprinting characters.
	 2.	 Triple-click in the paragraph of text under the heading BENEFITS OF 
OWNING A PET to select the entire paragraph.
	 3.	 Click the PAGE LAYOUT tab. In the Page Setup group, shown in Figure 17–1, 
click the Columns button 
, and then in the menu click Two. Deselect 
the text.

Adding Borders and Shading
Borders and shading also can help enhance the appearance of a document such as a 
newsletter or a flyer. Word offers many options for applying borders above, below, 
and around paragraphs of text. The borders can be customized by changing the line 
color, the line style, and the thickness of the line. You can also enhance the document 
content by adding shading behind the text.

Inserting and Formatting Graphics
To illustrate an idea presented in a document, or to make a document more func-
tional, you can include graphics, which are non-text items such as digital photos, 
scanned images, and pictures. You can also insert images created or modified in 
other applications, such as a drawing created in a graphics or drafting application. 
Graphics created in such an application are saved in a variety of formats, including 
JPEG (*.jpg), TIFF (*.tif), and bitmap (*.bmp).
Inserting Clip Art and Pictures
Clip art is a graphic that is ready to insert in a document. If you have an Internet 
connection open, Word has numerous illustrations and photographs you can access 
online. You can search for photos and clip art at the Microsoft Office.com Web site. 
This is called inserting an online picture.
You can access pictures that you have saved in the My Pictures folder or on 
SkyDrive. You can also connect to Facebook, Flickr, and other sites to get your 
pictures.

Quick Tip
You may find it easier to work 
with graphics in a document by 
reducing the magnification of the 
document. For example, you can 
change the zoom of the document 
view to 75 percent.
Resizing and Cropping a Graphic
Once you have inserted a graphic or picture in a document, there are many ways to 
manipulate the picture. To work with a graphic, you must select it. You will know 
it is selected when you see sizing handles, eight small circles and squares on the 
border of the graphic. When a graphic is selected, you can resize, cut, copy, paste, 
delete, and move it just as you would text.
Resizing stretches or shrinks the dimensions of a graphic. You can resize a 
graphic just vertically or just horizontally by using one of the square sizing handles 
on the side of the graphic, but this will distort the image. To change the size of a 
graphic without distorting the image, you must scale the graphic proportionally by 
dragging one of the circle corner sizing handles; these change both dimensions of the 
graphic (height and width) to maintain the proportions of the graphic.
When you crop a graphic, you cut off portions of the graphic that you do not want 
to show. When you outcrop a graphic, you add extra white space around the image.

Positioning a Graphic
By default, when you insert a graphic, Word positions the graphic in the line of 
text. This means that the graphic is positioned directly in the text at the insertion 
point. However, you can format the text in the document to wrap around the graphic. 
A text-wrapping format must be applied to the graphic before you can reposition the 
graphic in your document. You can then drag and drop the graphic anywhere within 
the printable area of the page.

Removing Backgrounds from Pictures
Sometimes the background colors do not fit the color scheme of the document, 
or you may just not want to include the background in a picture. When working 
with illustrations and photographs that have a solid color background, you can hide 
the background color by making the color transparent. When you enable the Set 
Transparent Color feature and click a color in the image, all the pixels of that color 
become transparent.
Word also provides a feature for automatically removing the background colors 
and images from a picture. When you apply the Remove Background feature, Word 
automatically suggests the elements to be removed from the image. If you are not 
satisfied with the results, you can identify the parts you want to keep or remove.
Even after a background has been removed from illustrations and photographs, 
you can still add effects such as shadows, glows, and reflections to the parts of the 
picture that are still visible. You can also clarify elements in a picture using contrast 
controls, and you can lighten or darken the picture by using the brightness controls.

Creating Your Own Graphics
Sometimes you may need to create your own graphics. For example, you may want 
to create a fancy title for a document, a map, or an organizational chart. Word offers 
several tools to simplify these tasks.
Creating WordArt Objects
WordArt is a feature that transforms text into a graphic. The WordArt graphic is 
created in a text box, a drawing object that displays text. Because the text box is 
a graphic, you can resize and position it like other graphics. Within the text box, 
you can change the font style, color, and size. To make the text decorative, you 
can fit the text within a preset shape, apply a gradient file, change the angle of the 
text, and apply special effects such as text borders and shadows. You can create 
your own styles, or you can choose from several predefined styles in the WordArt 
Gallery. Just like other objects, you can resize and reposition the WordArt object in 
the document.

Inserting Lines, Shapes, and Text Boxes
You can use drawing objects, which are shapes, curves, and lines, to create your 
own graphic. A shape is a predesigned drawing object, such as a star, an arrow, or a 
rectangle. You can resize and reposition drawing objects the same way you change 
the size and position of pictures and clip art, and the drawing objects can be changed 
and enhanced with color, patterns, and borders.
You can copy and paste lines, shapes, objects, and text boxes just like you copy and 
paste text and graphics. You can even change the direction of the text in the text boxes so 
the text is displayed vertically. When you are creating a drawing that requires multiple 
horizontal lines, begin by creating and formatting the first line. Then copy and paste 
multiple copies of the line in the document window and start building. Not only will 
you save time, but the objects will be more consistent. If you do not want all the objects 
to be exactly the same size, you can resize them after you paste them in the document.

Creating SmartArt Graphics
Now that you know how to create text boxes and use the drawing tools, consider 
how you would create an organizational chart. You would need to create multiple 
text boxes, arrange and align the boxes to show a hierarchy, connect the boxes with 
­horizontal and vertical lines, and then add text to the boxes. To create an effective 
illustration would be a tedious task, and you would likely spend a significant amount 
of time designing and creating the objects. But you can save yourself a lot of time 
and effort by using SmartArt graphics. SmartArt graphics are built-in, predesigned, 
and formatted layouts that you can use to illustrate concepts and ideas. The graph-
ics are organized in a gallery under eight different categories, and each category 
includes several layouts. You can see the Live Preview of the layouts to help you 
choose the graphic that best suits your needs. Once you choose a design, you can 
focus on the content and quickly produce a professional illustration.
Like the building blocks for headers, the objects in the SmartArt graphics 
include fields, and you can replace the field placeholder text. The field placeholder 
text does not print in SmartArt graphics, so if you do not enter data in a field, you 
do not need to delete the placeholder text. The designs are based on contemporary 
layouts, and the styles and formats used in the designs are easy to modify.
A SmartArt graphic is inserted in the document in a drawing canvas that pro-
vides a frame-like boundary between the graphic and the rest of the document. 
Using the drawing canvas is especially helpful if the graphic contains several shapes, 
because it keeps the shapes together as one object. You can easily add or remove 
objects, and you can reposition the graphic by dragging and dropping the object.

Someone Owns the Rights
Web pages often display photos, and computers make it easy to copy and download those images. 
However, just because information is published on the Internet does not mean that the information is in 
the public domain and is free. Someone owns the rights to those pictures, and intellectual property law 
ensures that the owner of the picture is entitled to copyright protection. Before you download or copy 
images from the Internet, consider how you will use the image. For example, you can copy or download any 
clip art or photo in the Microsoft Office Clip Art and Media Library without permission and free of charge 
when you use the images in your own work. However, there are restrictions that prohibit you from selling 
the image in a product. If you are not sure about how you can use the image, check with the owner.

  Online Discovery
In this lesson you worked with pictures saved in the JPEG format 
(*.jpg). Graphics such as photos and illustrations can be saved in 
several other formats including TIFF (*.tif), bitmap (*.bmp), and 
PNG (*.png). The resolution of the image and the size of the file

Module 2  Key Applications
For hundreds of years, accountants have used spreadsheets to gather, organize, and 
summarize text and numeric data. A spreadsheet is a grid of rows and columns into 
which you enter text data (e.g., surnames, cities, and states) and numerical data 
(e.g., dates, currency, and percentages). Each time one piece of data was changed, 
paper spreadsheets had to be manually recalculated, which was painstaking and time 
consuming.
Excel is an electronic application designed to replace the paper spreadsheet. 
Excel enables you to work with text, numbers, and formulas to create worksheets, 
tables, charts, and statistical analysis. When using an electronic spreadsheet, data 
changes are relatively easy and require far less time. Excel is especially useful when 
you need to organize and maintain large amounts of data.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions in the Excel lessons generally provide directions for using a mouse 
to access commands and features, such as point, click, double-click. If you are using 
a touch screen, you can use gestures, such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead 
of following the directions for using the mouse.
Identifying the Parts of the Excel Screen
Excel 2013 refers to a spreadsheet as a worksheet. The worksheet is always stored 
in a workbook that contains one or more worksheets. When working with large 
amounts of data, you can organize the data in multiple worksheets and still save all 
the data in one workbook. In addition, you can have multiple Excel workbooks open 
at the same time.
The Excel worksheet is divided into columns and rows. Columns of the work-
sheet appear vertically and are identified by letters at the top of the worksheet win-
dow. Rows appear horizontally and are identified by numbers on the left side of the 
worksheet window. Usually, the top row of a worksheet is used for explanatory text 
or headings that identify the type of data in each column.
Excel uses the Microsoft Office Fluent user interface you learned about in 
Lesson 11, with a Ribbon with contextual tabs that adapt to provide the tools and 
commands for specific tasks. To maximize the screen space for your worksheet win-
dow, you can easily minimize the Ribbon. You will also recognize the Quick Access 
Toolbar.

Module 2  Key Applications
Navigating a Workbook
A useful workbook has data organized logically in the cells. A cell is the intersec-
tion of a single row and a single column. The cell reference is the column letter fol-
lowed by the row number (for example, A1 or B4). Before you can enter data into a 
cell, you must first select the cell. When the cell is selected, a green border appears 
around the cell, and the column and row headings for the selected cell are shaded 
with a grey background. You can select a cell using either the mouse, the keyboard, 
or the touchscreen. When a cell is selected, it is called the active cell. The active cell 
is identified in the Name box at the top of the worksheet window.
To be useful, the rows and columns in the worksheets must be labeled effec-
tively so you can easily find and identify the data. To move around in a worksheet, 
you can use the mouse, the touchscreen, the scroll bar features, or the keyboard. 
Many of the keyboard shortcuts you learned to use in Word move the insertion point 
in Excel in similar ways. For example, the arrow keys move the insertion point to an 
adjacent cell in any direction, and Page Up or Page Down moves the insertion point 
up or down one screen at a time. Table 18–1 includes other keyboard shortcuts you 
can use to move the insertion point in an Excel worksheet.

Entering Data
You add data to the cells by entering text or a number in the active cell. The text or 
number is often referred to as a value.
Inserting Data
To enter data in a cell, the cell must be active. As you begin entering text, you see 
the insertion point indicating where the next character of text will appear. By default, 
Excel shows approximately eight characters in each cell. When text is too long for 
the width of a cell, it spills over into the next cell if the next cell is empty. If the next 
cell is not empty, the text that does not fit into the cell is not displayed, but it is still 
contained within the cell. When you enter more numbers than can fit in the cell, a 
series of number signs (####) is displayed in the cell.

Modifying the Worksheet Structure
Just as you can change a Word table structure, you can change the structure of a 
worksheet by adding or deleting rows and columns.
Selecting Multiple Cells in the Worksheet
To select an entire row in a worksheet, click the row heading, which is the number 
at the left of the row. To select an entire column, click the column heading, which 
is the letter at the top of the column. You can also select a row, column, or section 
of a worksheet by clicking and dragging the mouse to highlight the area you want 
to select. When you select a group of cells, the group is called a range. All cells in 
a range touch each other and form a rectangle. The range is identified by the cell 
references of the cell in the upper-left corner and the cell in the lower-right corner, 
separated by a colon (for example, A1:D4).

Inserting and Deleting Rows and Columns
When you insert or delete a row or a column in Excel, it affects the entire worksheet. 
All existing data is shifted in some direction. For example, when you add a new 
column, the existing data shifts to the right; when you add a new row, the data shifts 
down a row. To add or delete rows and columns, use the buttons in the Cells group 
on the HOME tab. To insert or delete multiple columns and rows in a single step, 
select the desired number of columns or rows before executing the command.

Changing Column Width and Row Height
As you already learned, sometimes the data you enter in a cell does not fit in the 
column. To accommodate the data, you can widen the column and change the height 
of a row. The default column width is 8.43 characters with the default text font. The 
default row height is 15.00.There are several options available for changing the cell 
width and height.

Editing the Worksheet Data
Sometimes after entering data in a worksheet, you need to reorganize it. You may 
even want to remove some of the data and not replace it. Or, you may want to move 
or copy existing data from one location to another.
Clearing, Replacing, and Copying Existing Data
You learned in Step-by-Step 18.4 that you can edit the data directly in the cell, or you 
can make the necessary changes to the cell contents in the formula bar. To replace 
cell contents, you can select the cell and enter the new data. The process for deleting 
data can be as simple as pressing Delete or Backspace. Using these keys, you can 
clear the cell contents.
Copying data saves you from having to enter the same data into another location. 
The process, as in all Office applications, is easy. Moving data is similar to copying 
data, except that you cut the data from one location and paste it in a new location. 
You can copy or move multiple cells of data at the same time. However, unlike copy-
ing or moving data in a Word table, when you paste data to a spreadsheet cell that 
already contains data, that existing data does not move to make room for the new 
data. Instead, the existing data in the destination cell is replaced with the pasted data. 
If you do not want to lose content, you need to copy or move data into empty cells.

Quick Tip
If you have a touch screen, you 
can enable the Touch mode 
command on the Quick Access 
Toolbar. The Ribbon will increase 
in height to allow you more space 
to touch the commands.
Using the AutoFill Feature to Copy Data
Filling data is another method for copying data in a worksheet. The AutoFill feature 
enables you to repeat the same data in a column or row. Using the AutoFill feature is 
faster than copying and pasting because filling requires only one step. However, the 
Fill command can only be used when the destination cells are adjacent to the original 
cell. You can use the mouse to automatically fill data up or down in the same column, 
or right or left in the same row.

Computer Software Engineers
Computer software engineers evaluate situations, analyze needs, develop software to perform functions, 
and then verify and test the software to ensure that the requirements are met. They develop many types of 
software, including business applications, computer games, operating systems, and technical applications 
used in a variety of industries. They also solve technical problems as they arise. The tasks evolve quickly, 
so computer software engineers must continually strive to acquire new skills to keep up with changing 
technology. They must pay attention to detail and have strong problem-solving and analytical skills. Much 
of the work is part of a team effort, so computer software engineers must be able to communicate effec-
tively with team members and other staff. Job prospects for computer software engineers are excellent. It 
is one of the fastest growing occupations.

  Teamwork Project
With a partner, explore voting statistics for your state in U.S. presi-
dential elections from 1980 through the most recent presidential 
election. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Using an almanac or Web research tools, find information on 
the popular vote for Republican, Democrat, and independent 
candidates for your state in each election. If there is more than 
one independent candidate, add together all the votes for all 
independent candidates. Collect data from 1980 through the 
most current presidential election. Divide the research assign-
ment evenly so both you and your partner gather the data. For 
example, you research the election results from 1980 to 1992, 
and your partner researches the results from 1996 to present.
	 2.	 Create a worksheet to compile your data. Save the document as 
TP 18–1, followed by your initials.
	 3.	 In column A, type 1980 in one cell, and then type 1984 in the 
cell below it. Use the AutoFill feature to add the remaining 
presidential election years up to and including the most recent 
presidential election.
	 4.	 Create columns for Republican, Democrat, and 
Independent candidates. Enter the data you have 
gathered and adjust the column widths as needed.
	 5.	 Add a column to your worksheet, and title it 
Winning Party. Insert the political party of the 
candidate who won each election nationally. Use 
the AutoComplete feature or the AutoFill feature 
to insert parties if the same party won two or more 
consecutive presidential elections.
	 6.	 Save the changes to the document.
	 7.	 Review the data in your completed worksheet, and determine 
which party won most often in the years you tracked. Close the 
document.

Module 2  Key Applications
Common uses of spreadsheets include reporting finances, managing expenses and 
budgets, and tracking student grades. A key feature of Microsoft Excel is how easy it 
is to organize the data in a worksheet. You can change the appearance of the spread-
sheet to emphasize specific data, and you can sort the information to highlight sig-
nificant data. You will also find it useful to print completed worksheets, and there are 
many options you can use to make your printed spreadsheets clear, informative, and 
professional looking.
Managing Worksheets
One of the advantages of working with electronic spreadsheets is that you can keep 
expanding the rows and columns, and then you can continue to add data. Eventually, 
though, as the spreadsheet grows in size, locating the data becomes more tedious. In 
this lesson you will learn how to manage worksheets so you can access data more 
efficiently.
Hiding and Showing Worksheet Data
A header row contains column headings or field names in a data source, such as 
a table or spreadsheet. In Excel, the header row provides labels that identify the 
­content in the worksheet columns. Effective column headings make it easy to iden-
tify information in a worksheet. When navigating through a large worksheet, though, 
the header row sometimes scrolls out of view, which makes it difficult to continue 
to identify the data in the cells or locate the correct cell so you can input data accu-
rately. One option to overcome this problem is to change the zoom setting. However, 
if you need to reduce the magnification significantly, you will not be able to read the 
data. Another option is to hide some of the rows and columns so you can focus on a 
particular range of data. When you hide rows and columns, the data remains intact; 
it is just not visible on the screen.
Step-by-Step 19.1
	 1.	 Start Excel and open the file Salaries from the drive and folder where 
your Data Files folder is stored. Save the Salaries workbook as Revised 
Salaries 1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Note that the headings in the header row identify the years from 1998 
to 2016. The labels in the first column provide employee numbers.
	 3.	 Press F5 to open the Go To dialog box. Type k44 and click OK to move to 
that cell. Note that you can no longer see the column headings at the top 
of the screen, so you cannot identify what year the money was earned.
	 4.	 Select the cell range K44:N47. Click the VIEW tab, and then in the 
Zoom group shown in Figure 19–1, click the Zoom button.

	 5.	 Note that the default Zoom setting is 100%. Click 50% to change the 
magnification setting, and then click OK. If necessary, scroll up to show 
the top row in the spreadsheet. The content in the cells is much smaller 
now, but you can see the labels for columns K, L, M, and N, as well 
as the employee numbers in column A. The row numbers and column 
letters are highlighted, which makes it easier to identify the employee 
numbers and years.
	 6.	 With the cell range selected, click the Zoom to Selection button. The 
selected cells are magnified and fill the entire worksheet window. Click 
the 100% button to reduce the magnification and return to the default 
settings.
	 7.	 Depending on the size of your screen, you may not see the first column 
that shows the employee numbers, in which case you cannot identify 
the employee. If necessary, drag the horizontal scroll bar to the left to 
view the data in column A.
	 8.	 You want to see the earnings for the years 2011 through 2016, so you 
can hide the columns for 1998–2010. Press and hold Ctrl, and then 
press Home to move back to cell A1. Select columns B through N.
	 9.	 Click the HOME tab, and then in the Cells group, click the Format button. 
Under Visibility, point to Hide & Unhide, and then in the submenu click 
Hide Columns as shown in Figure 19–2. Column O with the 2011 head-
ing is now the second column on the screen, but when you scroll down, 
you see that no cell contents appear in that column until row 49.

	10.	 You can also hide the rows above row 49. Select rows 2 through 48. Click 
the Format button, point to Hide & Unhide, and then click Hide Rows. 
Now you can quickly access the data for the years 2011 through 2016.
	11.	 Save the changes to the workbook. Then, save the workbook as Revised 
Salaries 2, followed by your initials.
	12.	 Select columns A and O. Click the Format button, point to Hide & Unhide, 
and then click Unhide Columns. All the columns in the worksheet are 
now visible again.
	13.	 Select rows 1 and 49. Click the Format button, point to Hide & Unhide, 
and then click Unhide Rows. Deselect the rows. All the cells in the 
worksheet are now visible.
	14.	 Save the changes, and leave the workbook open for the next Step-by-Step.
Freezing Rows and Columns
Another way to keep rows and columns visible as you navigate through a worksheet 
is to freeze them. When you freeze columns and/or rows, you lock them so you 
can keep an area visible as you scroll through the worksheet. By freezing rows and 
­columns, you do not have to hide any data.

workbook as Revised Salaries 3, followed by your initials.
	 8.	 Click the Freeze Panes button, and then click Unfreeze Panes.
	 9.	 Save the changes and leave the workbook open for the next Step-by-Step.
Splitting Rows and Columns
An alternative way to display data is to split a worksheet, which divides the work-
sheet into either two or four panes. Splitting the worksheet enables you to show dif-
ferent data in each pane. To split the window into two horizontal panes (one above the 
other), you must first select a cell anywhere within Column A. To split the window  
into two vertical panes (side by side), you must first select a cell anywhere within 
row 1. To split the window into four panes, you must first select a cell outside of 
column A and row 1. After splitting the worksheet into panes, you can increase or 
decrease the size of the panes by dragging the split bar.

Above and Beyond
By default, new blank workbooks 
include only one worksheet. The 
maximum number of worksheets 
per workbook is limited by the 
available memory.
Working with Multiple Worksheets
Excel is useful for organizing data into categories, such as time frames, sales regions, 
or account names. A workbook can be three dimensional because you have the length, 
width, and depth. When a single worksheet grows to a large size in length or width, 
you can organize related information in multiple worksheets, which adds depth.
Compare the workbook to a three-ring binder with tabs. When you need to add 
a new topic to the binder, you add a new tab to the binder. When you need to add a 
new category to an Excel workbook, you add a new worksheet to the workbook. At 
the bottom of the workbook window, a worksheet tab is displayed for quick and easy

Formatting the Page Layout
A well-organized worksheet must also have an effective page layout. When a work-
sheet contains a large amount of data, you can make some adjustments to the page 
layout so the data is easy to read and access.
Changing the Page Setup
Page Break Preview shows you exactly how the worksheet will be printed. When the 
worksheet is more than one page in length, Excel determines where to break the page 
and begin a new one. If you do not like where Excel has split the data between pages, 
you can create your own page break by dragging the page break to a new location or 
by selecting a row or cell and inserting a manual page break.
Portrait orientation, the default setting in Excel, formats the content of the 
­worksheet with the short edge of the page at the top. You can change to landscape 
orientation, which formats the worksheet with the long edge of the page at the top. 
Another option for page layout is to use the Fit to command to fit the worksheet to a 
number of pages you designate. The default setting is 100%, and the Fit to command 
scales the worksheet up or down as necessary.
When you change the page setup settings, the new settings apply only to the 
­current worksheet; they do not apply to all the worksheets in the workbook.

Creating a Header and a Footer
Headers and footers are a means of providing useful information on a printed work-
sheet. A header is information and/or graphics that are printed in the top margin of a 
worksheet, and a footer is information and/or graphics that are printed in the bottom 
margin of the worksheet.
You can manually create a header or footer by entering information in the header 
or footer pane. Fields can be used to automatically insert dates, times, filenames, the 
file path, the worksheet name, and page numbers. By using fields instead of manu-
ally entering the information, the information is always updated automatically. For 
example, if you use the date field in the footer, whenever you print the worksheet, 
the footer will include the current date. You can choose from several built-in headers 
or footers that are constructed using fields, or you can create your own customized 
headers and footers by inserting the fields yourself.

Customizing Print Options
Before you send a worksheet to the printer, take the time to see what the printed copy 
will look like. This gives you one more opportunity to review the page setup and 
confirm that the information you want to print will be included in the printed copy. 
For example, you might expect the printed worksheet to look like what you see on 
the screen. You are accustomed to seeing the worksheet gridlines, row numbers, and 
column letters. However, when using the default print settings, these elements are 
not printed.
By default, Excel prints the entire worksheet. If you do not want to print all 
the worksheet data, you can identify the range you want to print before you choose 
the Print command. When you create a print area, the print setting is saved with the 
worksheet.
If the worksheet will be printed on multiple pages, you may want to print 
the row and/or column headings on every page so the user does not need to keep 
­referring back to the first page of the worksheet to identify the cell contents. Also, 
when printing multiple copies, you can use the collated setting. When printed 
pages are collated, the printed pages are organized in the proper sequence. For 
example, if you are printing three copies of a worksheet with six pages, the first 
set of pages 1 through 6 comes out in the tray, then the second set of six pages is 
printed, and then the third set of six pages is printed.
Before printing a worksheet, you can change the settings for worksheet ori-
entation, page size, the margins, and scaling. You can easily change these settings 
using commands on the PAGE LAYOUT tab, in the Page Setup dialog box, or in 
Backstage view.

Formatting the Cell Contents
An effective spreadsheet is well formatted, with consistent formatting of similar ele-
ments. Formatting the contents of a cell, like formatting in other Office applications, 
changes the way it appears. You can control the font styles, sizes, and colors, and you 
can apply attributes such as bold and italic. Border, color, and fill color formats are 
useful for highlighting important information.
When you use the Cut and Copy commands to copy and move all the data in a 
cell, the formats are also moved or copied. However, when you delete the contents 
of a cell using the Delete key or the Backspace key, the formats for the cell remain in 
the cell. Therefore, if you enter new data in the cell, the existing formats will apply to 
the new contents. To remove the contents and the formats, you need to clear the cell. 
You can clear the contents and the formats from the cell, clear only the contents, or 
clear only the formats.
Merging Cells and Changing Font Styles and Sizes
There will be times when you want text to span across several columns. To do this, 
you can merge cells and combine several cells into a single cell. You can use merged 
cells to create a title or other informational text for your worksheet.
You learned in Lesson 13 that a font is the design of the typeface. Fonts are 
available in a variety of styles and sizes, and you can use multiple fonts in one work-
book. The font size is a measurement in points that determines the height of the font. 
When you increase the font size, Excel automatically changes the row height to fit 
the font size, but you can also manually set the row height. However, Excel does not 
adjust the cell width when the font size changes. Bold, italic, underline, and color 
formats can also add emphasis to the contents of a cell. You can use the Format 
Painter feature to copy formats.

Applying Conditional Formatting
You can quickly identify exceptions or trends in data and unusual cell values by 
applying conditional formatting. Conditional formatting applies designated formats 
to cells when the cell value meets specified conditions (criteria). You can highlight 
cell values with borders, fill colors, and font colors. You can also use Data Bars, 
Color Scales, or Icon Sets to help visualize the data. Several built-in rules are avail-
able so you can specify criteria based on a comparison operator or criteria based on 
a cut-off value.

Module 2  Key Applications
Adding Fill Colors, Borders, and Styles
You can emphasize important information in a cell, a row of cells, or a column by 
applying fill colors and/or border formats. You can use the Format Painter to copy 
the format of a worksheet cell without copying the contents of the cell. For example, 
after applying a date format in one cell, you may format other cells for dates by 
painting the format.
A cell style is a set of predefined formats you can apply to some of the work-
sheet data, such as a header row, a cell showing a total, or cells showing the date 
and time. To apply a cell style, you must first select a cell or a range of cells to be 
formatted. Excel offers more than 40 styles in the Cell Styles gallery that enable you 
to apply multiple formats quickly and consistently.
A table style is a set of predefined formats that you can apply to all the work-
sheet data with a single click. When you apply a table style, the selected cells are 
converted to an Excel table. When you convert a range of cells to an Excel table, 
you can easily and quickly format the table data. You can choose from 60 table 
styles in the Quick Styles gallery. If you do not want to work with the data in a 
table format, you can convert the table to a regular range and the table style format 
will remain intact.
The cell styles and table styles may override some or all existing formats that 
you have applied. If desired, you can modify styles after they are applied, and you 
can save your own customized styles.

Sorting and Filtering Data
Worksheets can function as basic databases. You can sort the data and numbers in 
the columns based on one criteria or on multiple criteria. To sort worksheet data, you 
must indicate the column on which you want to base the sort. If the worksheet has 
multiple columns of data, you can base the sort on data in as many as three different 
columns. For example, you can sort the worksheet contents first by the column C 
data, then by column A data, and then by column B data.
In addition to sorting data, you can filter worksheet data. When you filter data, 
you screen data that matches specified criteria. The data that does not meet the crite-
ria is hidden, and only the data that meets the criteria is shown.

Sharing Workbooks
In a team effort to create and maintain a workbook, it is common for multiple users 
to access and edit the workbook. It is also common to share workbook data without 
allowing edits. Excel offers several options for sharing workbooks.
Tracking Changes and Adding Comments
When you track changes in Excel, cells are highlighted and details about the change 
can be viewed in a ScreenTip. Then you can either accept or reject those changes. 
You can view a history of all the detailed changes in a separate worksheet both 
before and after the changes are accepted or rejected. By default, the change history 
is saved for 30 days. When you enable the setting to track changes in a workbook, 
the workbook automatically becomes a shared workbook. When you toggle off the 
change tracking feature, or when you stop sharing the workbook, all change history 
is permanently deleted.
You can also add comments to selected cells. The annotations display in a 
ScreenTip, but they do not appear on the history worksheet.
Above and Beyond
To share a workbook, you can 
make the file available by 
uploading it to a network location 
or a SkyDrive folder. Multiple 
users can make changes, and 
then you merge the data from 
their copies back into the original 
file. To prevent people from 
opening your workbooks, you can

Saving a Workbook to Share
When sharing workbooks with others, you need to consider that not all users will be 
using Excel 2013. Before distributing the soft copy of a workbook, you may need to 
save it in a format that enables those working with different applications, platforms, 
and operating systems to access the file. For example, you can save a workbook in 
a file format for an earlier version of Excel, but in order to make the file compatible 
with the earlier software version, you may lose some functionality.

A convenient way to share a workbook is to upload the workbook to a net-
work where files are uploaded to a library on the Internet. When signed into your 
Microsoft Account, you can use SkyDrive to store and share your files. You can also 
share a workbook by attaching the workbook to an e-mail message. You can choose 
to save the attached workbook in either a PDF or an XPS file format. Both PDF and 
XPS formats are designed to preserve the visual appearance and layout of each page, 
and they enable fast viewing and printing. By default, when you save a workbook in 
the PDF/XPS format, only the active worksheet is saved in the new file. To include 
multiple worksheets in the PDF or XPS file, you must select the additional work-
sheets. Each worksheet begins on a new page in the PDF/XPS file.
Step-by-Step 19.15

ing loss of function. Click Continue. When prompted to save the work-
book in an earlier version of Excel, click OK. Note that the title bar 
now shows the filename Utilities Expenses 8 [Shared] [Compatibility 
Mode] - Excel.
	 3.	 If necessary, click the Bills worksheet tab. Press and hold Shift, and 
then click the Energy Use worksheet tab. You do not want to include 
the eServices worksheet tab in the selection, because that worksheet 
contains confidential information that you do not want to share.
	 4.	 Note that the title bar for the Excel window now displays Utilities 
Expenses 8 [Group] [Shared] [Compatibility Mode] - Excel. Also, the 
selected worksheet tabs have green underlines.
	 5.	 Click the FILE tab, and then click Save As. Navigate to the drive and 
folder where you save your solution files. In the Save as type box, 
select the XPS Document (*.xps) format. Leave the file name as is. 
Click Save.
	 6.	 The workbook opens in the XPS Viewer. Note that the document has two 
pages. The Bills worksheet data appears on the first page. Scroll down 
to the second page. The filtered data is displayed on a separate page 
because it is stored in a separate worksheet. Press Alt+F4 to close the 
XPS Viewer window. If necessary, click the Desktop tile on the Windows

Technology Careers
Computer Software
Have you ever seen a community theater musical, attended a concert, or enjoyed a touring company’s pro-
duction of a popular show? The performers on stage could not entertain you without the help of a talented 
group of stage technicians who depend on computer technology to do their jobs. The lighting, sound, and 
stage sets of a theatrical production all use specialized computer programs to create the special effects. 
But stage technicians also use more common types of computer software to do their jobs. For example, 
the property manager, who tracks the props used in a show, can keep track of hundreds of small items 
using a spreadsheet program such as Excel that identifies which actor uses a prop in which scene, as well 
as where the prop is stored. The stage manager depends on a note-taking program to keep track of the 
director’s staging instructions. Long-distance collaboration is common and a designer may work online with 
technicians across the country to view designs and exchange e-mails to quickly contact coworkers.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
To keep the header row in view when navigating through 
a large worksheet, you can change the zoom setting. If that 
does not work because the worksheet is too large, you can hide 
some of the rows and columns so you can focus on a particular 
range of data, or you can freeze some rows and columns.
n 
You can delete or add one or several worksheets to a work-
book, and you can rename each worksheet.
n 
Headers and footers can be added to worksheets to provide 
information such as the source and date of the data.
n 
You can change the page orientation or use the Fit to feature to 
fit all the data on a specified number of pages.
n 
You can control the print output by inserting page breaks 
manually or creating a print area for the worksheet. With the 
default settings, the gridlines and row and column headings 
appear on the screen in worksheets but they do not appear 
when the worksheets are printed. You can change the settings 
to hide these elements on the screen and/or include them in 
printed worksheets.
n 
Before you print, you can preview the worksheet to see what 
it will look like when it is printed. You can choose to print the 
active worksheet only, or you can choose to print all worksheets 
in the workbook.
n 
There are many options available for formatting cell contents, 
including merging cells, changing font styles and sizes, chang-
ing the alignment within the cells, and applying number and 
date formats. Conditional formatting enables you to quickly 
identify exceptions or trends in data as well as unusual cell 
values.
n 
To enhance the appearance and highlight data within the work-
sheet, you can add borders and fill colors to cells. There are 
also many predefined styles available that you can quickly 
apply to give the worksheet a professional look and make read-
ing the data easier. 
n 
To organize worksheet data numerically or alphabetically, you 
can sort the data based on a single column, or you can sort the 
data based on multiple criteria. To screen for data that meets 
certain criteria, you can filter the data.
n 
You can track changes and add comments to worksheets. To 
preserve the visual appearance and layout of each worksheet, 
you can save all the workbook data in a PDF or an XPS file 
format.

Lesson 19  Organizing and Enhancing Worksheets	
Mod2-317
  Teamwork Project
Worksheets are excellent tools to organize information so you 
can make easy comparisons between sets of data. For this project, 
assume you need to set up a home office with new communica-
tions equipment. You have a tight budget, so you need several price 
options for each piece of equipment. With two or three teammates, 
gather and organize information as follows:
	 1.	 As a team, identify a list of six to eight pieces of equipment 
that a state-of-the-art home office needs. Some of these may 
be a desktop or laptop computer; an all-in-one printer that 
includes scanning, copying, printing, and faxing functions; a 
wireless phone; and so on.
	 2.	 Divide the list of equipment among the team members so each 
teammate is responsible for finding information on at least 
two items. Using computer catalogs or Web resources, find 
low-end, moderate, and high-end options for each item. For 
example, low-end options for a copier would include 10 pages 
per minute, black and white copies, and automatic document 
feeder. Moderate options for a copier would include 20 pages 
per minute, color printing, scanning, and faxing. High-end 
options would include 30+ pages per minute, sorting, collat-
ing, and stapling. 
	 3.	 Designate a team member to create a worksheet, 
using the directions below, to organize the list of 
equipment the team members identify.
	A.	 Create a header row with the column head-
ings Item, Low End, Moderate, and High 
End so you can enter descriptions and prices 
for each equipment item.
	B.	
Enter the research results in one worksheet. Format 
the worksheet so you can clearly see all data you have 
entered. Highlight cells, rows, or columns with color fill, 
fill color, or borders to indicate the items you think are 
most important.
	C.	
Enable the track changes feature.
	D.	 Save the workbook as TP 19–1, followed by the initials of 
the team member who created the workbook.
	 4.	 After the team member creates a draft of the workbook, share 
the workbook with each of the team members, via e-mail, a 
network, or the Cloud. Each team member should make edits 
they feel are necessary and provide feedback using comments.
	 5.	 Designate one of the team members to review the comments, 
accept or reject the edits, delete the comments, and make any 
other necessary changes.
	 6.	 As a team, compare your worksheet with other teams in the 
class to see what equipment items each team considered most 
important for a home office.

Module 2  Key Applications
One of the primary uses of a spreadsheet is to manipulate numbers. Excel provides 
several tools that enable you to complete complex and repetitious calculations 
accurately, quickly, and easily. And, there are several more tools available to create 
graphics to represent the data.
Working with Formulas
Instead of using a calculator to perform mathematical calculations, you can use 
Excel tools to perform the tasks. The equation used to calculate values in a cell is 
known as a formula. A formula uses numbers and cell references to perform calcula-
tions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A formula consists 
of two components: an operand and an operator. The operand is a number or cell 
reference. The operator is a symbol that indicates the mathematical operation to 
perform with the operands. For example, in the formula =B5+6, the operands are 
B5 and 6; the operator is the plus sign. Table 20–1 lists some of the mathematical 
operators used in Excel.
◗  Vocabulary
formula
operand
operator
Quick Tip
To create a minus sign in a 
­formula, use the hyphen key in 
the number row on the keyboard 
or on the number keypad. You can 
find all the mathematical operator 
symbols except percent (%) on 
the number keypad.
All Excel formulas begin with the equal sign. This tells Excel that you are enter-
ing a formula instead of a numeric value. A formula can be as simple as a single cell 
reference. For example, if you enter the formula =B3 in cell C4, then cell C4 will 
show the same contents as cell B3. If you then change the value in cell B3, cell C4 is 
automatically updated to reflect the change.
Formulas containing more than one operator are called complex formulas. For 
example, the formula =A4*B5+10 will perform both multiplication and ­addition. The 
sequence used to calculate the value of a formula is called the order of ­evaluation. 
Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction, and then 
calculations are performed from the left side of the formula to the right side. You can 
change the order of evaluation by using parentheses; calculations enclosed in paren-
theses are performed first. Be sure you position the parentheses correctly when you 
structure a formula. For example, =8/(4–2) equals 4, while =(8/4)–2 equals 0.

Quick Tip
When creating formulas, there 
must be a closing parenthesis 
for every opening parenthesis. 
Otherwise, an error message 
appears when you enter the 
formula.

Lesson 20  Creating Formulas and Charting Data	
Mod2-321
Table 20–2 provides examples to demonstrate the order of evaluation.
Computer users often make the mistake of assuming the formula will always 
deliver correct results. However, computers do not evaluate or assess the worksheet 
values. The information is simply processed, and the worksheet results are only as 
good as the data and formulas that are entered. If you input an incorrect formula, or 
if you input invalid data, the formula produces a false result—often referred to as 
“Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO).
Creating and Editing a Formula
Generally, cell references are used in formulas rather than the actual value in a cell. 
If the value in the cell changes, the formula does not need to be updated. There are 
two ways to enter a cell reference into a formula: you can enter the cell reference, 
or you can click the cell. When entering the cell reference, the column letter can be 
entered in either uppercase or lowercase. In the Step-by-Steps in this text, the col-
umn letters you will enter are shown in lowercase, while those you click are shown 
in uppercase.
You can edit a formula the same way you edit text and data in cells.

Lesson 20  Creating Formulas and Charting Data	
Mod2-323
Using Relative and Absolute Cell References
By default, when you create formulas, the cell references are formatted as ­relative 
cell references, which means when the formula is copied to another cell, the 
cell references will be adjusted relative to the formula’s new location. This auto-
matic adjustment is helpful when you need to repeat the same formula for several 
­columns or rows.
There are times, though, when you do not want the cell reference to change 
when the formula is moved or copied to a new cell. For example, you may be cal-
culating a discount rate on a purchase order. To calculate the discount, the prices 
should always be multiplied by a fixed amount. To create this formula, you format 
an absolute cell reference that does not change when the formula is copied or moved 
to a new location. To create an absolute cell reference, you insert a dollar sign ($) 
before the column letter and/or the row number of the cell reference you want to stay 
the same. For example, =$A$1 is a formula with an absolute reference to cell A1.
A cell reference that contains both relative and absolute references is called 
a mixed cell reference. For example, you can have an absolute column reference 
and a relative row reference. Or, you can have a relative column reference and an 
absolute row reference. To illustrate, =$A1 is a formula with a mixed cell reference. 
The column reference is absolute, and the row reference is relative. When formulas 
with mixed cell references are copied or moved, the row or column references that 
are preceded by a dollar sign will not change. However, the row or column refer-
ences that are not preceded by a dollar sign will adjust relative to the cell to which 
they are moved.
◗  Vocabulary
relative cell reference
absolute cell reference
mixed cell reference
Above and Beyond
You can toggle a cell ­reference 
from relative to absolute to 
mixed. Position the insertion 
point in or next to the desired 
cell reference in the formula 
bar. Each time you press F4, 
the cell reference will change. 
For ­example, the cell reference 
A1 toggles to $A$1, then to 
A$1, then to $A1, and then 
back to A1.

Quick Tip
When you insert or delete a 
new row or column that affects 
a range of cells identified in a 
formula, Excel will ­automatically 
update the range in the ­formula 
to reflect the change(s) in 
the range.
Using Function Formulas
Obviously a worksheet can contain a great deal of data. The tools within Excel allow 
you to easily obtain commonly used information from data. For example, if you 
want to know the average of a set of values, you could use a function formula to 
perform the calculation. A function formula is a special formula that names a func-
tion instead of using operators to calculate a result. Excel has more than 400 built-in 
functions for performing calculations. Mathematical functions perform calculations 
that you could perform using a scientific calculator. Statistical functions are func-
tions that describe large quantities of data. For example, a statistical function can 
determine the average of a range of data. Excel provides other types of functions, 
including trigonometric and logical functions, which are beyond the scope of this 
book. Table 20–3 describes some of the most common mathematical and statistical 
functions available in Excel. There are several methods for entering functions in the 
worksheet. You can enter an equal sign, the function name, and the argument. Or, if 
you want help entering the formula, you can use the buttons on the Ribbon.

Using the SUM Function
Although it is easy to enter a formula, if the formula consists of several cells, it could 
take you a long time to enter all the cell references. A shortcut for entering cell refer-
ences is to name a range of cells. The AutoSum feature enables you to quickly iden-
tify a range and enter a formula. When you use the AutoSum feature, Excel scans the 
worksheet and identifies the most logical column or row of adjacent cells containing 
numbers to sum.

argument
After identifying the range of cells, the AutoSum feature creates a function 
formula to calculate the sum of the range. In this case, the function is SUM. The 
SUM function formula is the most frequently used type of function formula. There 
are three components of a function formula: the equal sign, the function name, and 
the arguments. The equal sign tells Excel that a formula follows. The function name 
tells Excel what to do with the data. The argument is a value, a cell reference, a 
range, or text that acts as an operand in a function formula, and it is enclosed in 
parentheses after the function name. You will learn about other function formulas 
in the next section of this lesson. Figure 20–2 illustrates an example of a formula 
containing the SUM function. The equal sign indicates that a formula follows. The 
function name SUM designates that the values of the five cells included in the 
argument (B4:B8) will be added.

Using the COUNT Function
The COUNT function is a statistical function that determines the number of cells 
in the argument range that contain numerical values. It is important to distinguish 
the difference between the COUNT function and the SUM function. The COUNT 
function tallies the number of occurrences of numerical data, and the SUM function 
totals all the numerical data.
Like the SUM function, and several other commonly used functions, you can 
enter the COUNT function by clicking a button on the Ribbon. Another alternative 
is to open the Function Arguments dialog box, which is very useful when you use 
functions that are not as common. The Function Arguments dialog box is useful in 
the process of building a formula that contains a function. The intent of the Function 
Arguments dialog box is to guide you in creating formulas, but sometimes the dialog 
box can get in the way when you are creating the formula. The collapse and expand 
features in the Function Arguments dialog box allow you to minimize and maximize 
the dialog box as you work with it. Step-by-Step 20.4 will show you how to access 
this dialog box and the hundreds of built-in functions that Excel offers.

Using the AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX Functions
The AVERAGE function is also a statistical function. It calculates the average of the 
range identified in the argument. For example, the function =AVERAGE(B2,G2) 
calculates the average of the values contained in cells B2 and G2. Note that in this 
example, the cell references are separated by a comma instead of a colon. That is 
because these cells are not adjacent, and only two cells are identified in the range. 
The comma is used to distinguish the two cell references.
The MIN (minimum) and MAX (maximum) functions are two more statistical 
functions. The MIN function shows the smallest number contained in the range iden-
tified in the argument. The MAX function shows the largest number contained in the 
range identified in the argument.

Creating Formulas that Reference Cells in 
Multiple Worksheets
As you already know, Excel features enable you to work with multiple worksheets 
(pages) in three dimensions (3D). The 3D reference enables you to access data from 
three different dimensions in the workbook: length, width, and depth. Length and 
width refer to the worksheet rows and columns. Depth refers to the ability to connect 
the worksheets by creating formulas that reference the same cell or range in multiple 
worksheets. These 3D references are often used in summary worksheets to condense 
and total data from other worksheets.

Troubleshooting Common Formula Errors
When Excel cannot properly perform a calculation, an error value appears in the 
cell where you entered the formula. The error may exist because the cell contains 
text instead of a numeric value. An error value appears if the cell referenced in the 
formula contains an error or if a formula tries to divide by zero. An error value also 
appears if the cell is not wide enough to show the result. There are a number of com-
mon errors that occur—and common causes for those errors. Table 20–4 lists these 
common errors, their typical causes, and some possible solutions. Fortunately, Excel 
provides help to solve formula errors.
	10.	 Click cell B6. Type =. Click the Western worksheet tab, and then click 
cell B16. A marquee surrounds the active cell. Press Enter. The value 
$654,000 is displayed in cell B6 in the Summary worksheet.
	11.	 Click cell C6. Type =western!c6. Press Enter. The value $53,879 is 
displayed in cell C6. You realize you made an error in the formula. Click 
cell C6. In the formula bar, position the insertion point between C and 
6, and type 1 so the modified formula is displayed as =Western!C16. 
Press Enter. The calculation is updated, and the value $657,242 is 
displayed in cell C6.
	12.	 Click cell D6. Type =western!d16. Press Enter. The value $3,242 is 
displayed in cell D6.
	13.	 Note that the value in cell C5 is $623,692 and the value in cell D5 
is $10,692. Click the Southern worksheet tab, and then click cell C8. 
Type 52199, and press Enter. The cell value is replaced, and cells C16 
and D16 are updated. Click the Summary worksheet tab. The values in 
cells C5 and D5 have automatically been updated to reflect the edits 
made on the Southern worksheet. Cell C5 now displays $623,982, and 
cell D5 displays $10,982.
	14.	 Save the changes, and then close the workbook.
Quick Tip
Excel has an AutoCorrect feature 
that automatically checks a 
formula for common keyboarding 
mistakes. Sometimes Excel is 
able to identify the error. If so, a 
suggested correction appears in 
an alert box.

Module 2  Key Applications
Table 20–4  Common errors, their causes, and solutions
ERROR
TYPICAL CAUSE/SOLUTION
#####
Cause: Occurs when the column is not wide enough or if a negative date is entered
Solution: If the column is not wide enough, AutoFit the column or change the number format 
so the number will fit within the column; negative dates usually occur when there is an incor-
rect formula calculating a date, so check and correct your date formula
#VALUE!
Cause: Occurs when the wrong type of argument or operand is used, which could result from 
a formula referencing cells with text when the formula requires a number
Solution: Trace the error to determine the cause and correct it
Cause: Occurs when a cell reference in the formula refers back to its own cell, either directly 
or indirectly, creating a circular reference
Solution: Remove the circular reference or enable repeated recalculations
#DIV/0!
Cause: Occurs when a number is divided by zero, which is most often caused by using a cell 
reference to a blank cell or to a cell that contains a zero
Solution: Trace the error and correct the reference
#N/A
Cause: Occurs when a value is not available to a function or formula, often caused by ­missing 
data or by referencing a cell that contains #N/A instead of data (which you can use as a 
placeholder for data that is not yet available)
Solution: Trace the error and replace the missing data with a real value
Cause: Can be caused by giving an inappropriate value for a lookup
Solution: To resolve, make sure the lookup value argument is the correct type of value—for 
example, a value or a cell reference, but not a range reference
#REF!
Cause: Occurs when a cell reference is not valid, often caused by deleting cells referred to by 
other formulas or pasting moved cells over cells referred to by other formulas
Solution: To correct this error, trace the error and then change the formulas; if you notice the 
error right after deleting or pasting cells, restore the cells on the worksheet by clicking Undo 
immediately after you delete or paste the cells which caused the error
Cause: This can also be caused by a link to an application that is not running
Solution: To resolve the error in this case, start the application the worksheet is trying to link to
#NUM!
Cause: Occurs with invalid numeric values in a formula or function, often caused by using an 
unacceptable argument in a function that requires a numeric argument
Solution: To correct this, make sure the arguments used in the function are numbers—for 
example, even if the value you want to enter is $1,000, enter 1000 in the formula
Cause: This error can also be caused by using a worksheet function that iterates, such as IRR 
or RATE, and the function cannot find a result
Solution: To resolve the error in this case, use a different starting value for the worksheet 
function or change the number of times Excel iterates formulas
#NULL!
Cause: Occurs when using a space where it is not appropriate
Solution: Check for inappropriate spaces in the formula; for example, when referencing two 
ranges, make sure a comma separates the ranges: =SUM(C1:C5,D4:D5)

Using Graphics to Represent Data
Obviously a worksheet can contain a great deal of information. The results of a 
worksheet are only accurate if correct data and formulas have been entered. If you 
are certain of the accuracy of the content of the worksheet, then the next questions 
are: What does the data in this worksheet tell me? What logical conclusions can 
I draw from it?
As you analyze worksheet data, you may notice in a column that the values 
are continually increasing. If this column is a chronological listing of your com-
pany’s sales, you could conclude that there is a trend—that your company’s sales are 
increasing each year. On the other hand, if this same column is not a chronological 
listing of sales, but rather a listing of sales by region, it is not logical to interpret a 
trend, but you can compare the data for each region.
To draw conclusions from the worksheet data, you can translate the data to a 
chart, which is a graphic representation of your worksheet data. Charts are an excel-
lent means of conveying information, and they are extremely useful for summariz-
ing, clarifying, or highlighting data. In a business, management at all levels must 
understand the data generated on a daily basis, but upper-level management relies on 
charts to look for trends and oddities.

Module 2  Key Applications
When the values and their representation are correct, a chart can help you gain 
an understanding that would perhaps not be clear when looking at the worksheet 
data. However, if a chart is not set up correctly, the representation can be confus-
ing or misleading. The first step in creating a chart is to decide what type of chart 
you want to create. Excel provides several options for chart types. The chart type 
you select will depend on the data you want to represent. Table 20–5 lists some of 
the Excel chart types and a description of the types of data you can illustrate with 
each chart.
Excel 2013 provides a new feature to help you choose a chart type. For the 
best outcome, use, the Recommended Charts command in the Charts group on 
the INSERT tab. Excel will suggest a list of different chart types generated by an 
algorithm based on your selected data. Live previews with your selected data will 
make it easier for you to choose a chart type.
An attractive chart will grab attention and Excel provides many predesigned 
chart layouts and styles that make it easy for you to create professional-looking 
charts. But to convey meaning, the values represented in the charts must be cor-
rectly labeled. After you decide which chart type to create, the next step is to decide 
which chart options you want to use. To do this, you must first understand the ele-
ments in a chart. Figure 20–13 identifies the chart elements. Take time to review 
and become familiar with the various parts. Customizing the table elements helps 
identify and clarify the chart contents.

Creating a Chart
When creating a chart, you define specific data to be included in the analysis. As a 
result, you frequently need to select nonadjacent cells. To select nonadjacent cells, 
click the first cell, press and hold Ctrl, and then click the next cell. Once the data is 
identified, you choose a chart type and the chart is inserted in the worksheet.
When the chart is selected, the Chart Elements button displays outside the 
upper-right corner of the canvas. The Chart Elements button provides a menu for 
selecting the elements that can add more value to the chart such as titles, data labels, 
and legends.
There may be occasions when the data used to create the chart changes after 
the chart has been created. Fortunately, you do not need to create a new chart. When 
you edit the data in the worksheet, the chart is automatically updated to reflect the 
changes. And, if you decide the chart type is not effective, you can choose a new 
chart type without starting over.

Changing Chart Formats
Many of the parts of the chart such as the chart title and the axis titles are positioned 
on the chart in a text box. When you click the part of the chart you want to change, 
the object boundaries will appear, and then you can change the formats.
You can choose whether to keep the chart in the same worksheet as the data 
on which the chart is based, or you can move the chart to a different worksheet. 
An embedded chart is a chart created on the same worksheet as the data used in 
the chart. One advantage of embedding a chart on the same page as the data is that 
the data and the chart can be viewed at the same time. If the chart will not fit on the 
same worksheet with the data, or if you want to create more than one chart from the 
same data, you will probably want to move the chart to a separate worksheet.

Using Sparklines to Show Data Trends
Another option for using graphics to represent data is to add a sparkline to the data. 
A sparkline is a tiny chart embedded in a cell. The sparkline provides a snapshot 
of data in a row or column, such as a trend or an increase or decrease in values. 
They are especially useful when you want to present and summarize data in a small 
amount of space.
You can insert a single sparkline for a set of data, or you can create multiple 
sparklines at the same time. After inserting a sparkline, you can use built-in formats 
to apply a color scheme, or you can customize the graphic by using commands to 
choose a color for high, low, first, and last values. When the data in the correlated 
cells change, the sparklines are immediately updated.

Killer Apps
Did you know that early electronic spreadsheet applications were the “killer apps” for personal computers? 
Killer applications are computer applications that are so necessary or desirable that they prove the core value 
of some larger technology, and as a result, they substantially increase the sales of the platform they run on.
VisiCalc is considered to be one of the earliest examples of a “killer app.” VisiCalc, originally devel-
oped in 1978 for the Apple II computer, was one of the early electronic spreadsheet applications, 
and it spurred the sale of thousands of Apple II platform computers. In 1983, the Lotus Development 
Corporation released Lotus 1-2-3, a spreadsheet application that also offered charts and basic database 
operations. Shortly after Lotus 1-2-3 was released, the IBM PC became the number-one selling computer. 
Then in 1985, Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac. Two years later, Microsoft released 
a new version of Excel to run in the Windows environments. This new version of Excel was one of the first 
applications that Microsoft introduced to run on the Windows operating system, and therefore, it was also 
one of the first applications developed for a graphical user interface.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
If you do not want the cell reference to change when the for-
mula is moved or copied to a new location, the cell reference 
must be formatted as an absolute cell reference.
n 
Functions are special formulas that do not require operators. 
Excel provides more than 400 built-in functions to help you 
perform mathematical, statistical, and other functions.
n 
The AutoSum feature enables you to quickly identify a range 
of cells and enter a formula. For a range of cells specified in 
the argument, the AVERAGE function finds the average, the 
SUM function totals the values, and the COUNT function 
shows the number of cells with numerical values.
n 
You can use the MIN and MAX functions to find the smallest 
or largest number in a range.
n 
Formulas can reference cells in multiple worksheets, and 3D 
references are often used to condense and total data from other 
worksheets.
n 
If Excel cannot perform a calculation, an error value and an 
Error Checking button will appear to alert you and help you fix 
the error. Then, you can edit the formula directly in the cell or 
in the formula bar.
n 
A chart shows the worksheet data visually and often helps 
the audience understand and interpret the information more 
clearly. To draw logical conclusions from the data and make 
a correct assessment, you must ensure that the data is accurate 
and that you know what the values represent.
n 
When the worksheet data is changed, the chart is automatically 
updated to reflect those changes. Chart types, formats, and options 
can be changed at any time, even after the chart has been created.
n 
Instead of using charts, you can use sparklines to provide a 
visual representation of the data.
n 
The Quick Analysis tool provides a quick preview of work-
sheet data converted into visual forms.

Lesson 20  Creating Formulas and Charting Data	
Mod2-355
  Teamwork Project
As you have learned in this lesson, functions can help you analyze 
data in a number of ways. Excel includes hundreds of functions to 
help you with financial, statistical, mathematical, and other prob-
lems. In this project, explore two functions of your choice with a 
partner to learn how the functions can be applied to specific data 
analysis situations. Make sure your functions are not covered in this 
lesson. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In a blank Excel worksheet, show the FORMULAS tab. Review 
the functions in the Function Library group to choose two 
functions you are interested in exploring with your teammate. 
(Your functions should come from two different categories.)
	 2.	 Read the Excel Help files and visit the Microsoft.com Web 
site to learn about the functions you have chosen. Gather 
information about the kind of data the func-
tion can analyze and what kinds of information 
you must supply as arguments for the functions. 
Consider where this type of data might occur, such as the type 
of job where you would encounter it.
	 3.	 Save the worksheet as TP 20–1, followed by your initials.
	 4.	 Construct the worksheet(s) containing data appropriate for 
each function, and then use the functions to calculate the data.
	 5.	 After you are sure you are using the functions correctly, save 
the changes to the workbook.
	 6.	 Make a team presentation to share what you have learned 
about the functions you explored.

Module 2  Key Applications
PowerPoint helps you create, edit, and manipulate professional-looking slide shows 
that you can use to facilitate meetings, supplement classroom learning, and share 
information using a wide variety of media including graphics, pictures, and audio 
and video clips. Creating a slide show may seem like an overwhelming task, but 
PowerPoint provides many features that make that task easy and fun.
Identifying the Parts of the 
PowerPoint Screen
In PowerPoint, the document file is called a presentation. A presentation is a collec-
tion of individual slides for an onscreen display of information and graphics. A slide 
is a single page of a presentation.
When you first start PowerPoint, you can choose to open an existing presenta-
tion or create a new blank presentation. As in other Office applications, you can 
quickly access the most recently opened presentations. You can search for additional 
presentations by using the Open Other Presentations command.
The PowerPoint application window shows many familiar parts, including the 
Ribbon, Quick Access Toolbar, title bar, sizing buttons, Close button, and status bar. 
Scroll bars are displayed when the presentation includes more than one slide. After 
the application has started, you can also use Backstage view to open existing presen-
tations and save revised or new presentations.
The Slides tab shows a thumbnail for each slide in the presentation file. The 
slide pane in the presentation window contains the slide content. The dotted bor-
ders in the slide pane identify placeholders where you can insert text and graphics 
on the slide.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions in the PowerPoint lessons generally provide directions for using a 
mouse to access commands and features. For example, the instructions may refer 
to actions such as point, click, double-click, or right-click. If you are using a touch 
screen, you can use gestures such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead of fol-
lowing the directions for using the mouse.

Changing the Slide View
PowerPoint offers five different ways to view your presentation. Table 21–1 
describes each of the views. Normal is the default view and the view you have used 
so far in PowerPoint. You will explore the Outline, Slide Sorter, and Reading views 
in the next Step-by-Step. You will learn more about the Notes Page and Slide Show 
views later in this lesson.
When active, the Outline tab shows the text on each slide, and it enables you to 
edit the text and navigate and organize the slides in the presentation.
Like other Office applications, you can change the magnification of the content 
on the screen by using the Zoom button in the Zoom group on the VIEW tab, or 
by using the zoom controls in the status bar at the bottom of the window. Before 
changing the zoom setting, you must click the Slides tab, the Outline tab, or the 
slide pane to indicate where you want to change the zoom level. You can use the Fit 
to Window command to automatically fit the slide pane in the available space in the 
application window.

Managing Slides
As you prepare a presentation, it is common to add new slides, copy slides, and 
delete slides. It is also common to rearrange the sequence of the slides. You can eas-
ily manage the slides in Normal view and in Slide Sorter view.
You can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to copy or move slides. The 
slide content, layouts, and formats are stored on the Clipboard. Remember that 
the Clipboard is a temporary storage place in the computer’s memory. You can paste 
Clipboard items as many times as you want.
You can change the order of the slides by using drag-and-drop editing as well 
as by using the cut-and-paste method. It may be a little easier to use drag-and-drop 
editing in Slide Sorter view, where all the slides are arranged in rows in one screen, 
but you can also rearrange slides in the Slides tab in Normal view and in the Outline 
tab in Outline view.

Creating a New Presentation
PowerPoint provides several options for creating a new presentation. You can cre-
ate a new blank presentation and apply preformatted colors, styles, and layouts. 
PowerPoint provides several presentation templates that already contain formatted 
content that you can modify to customize the presentation for your needs. You can 
also open an existing presentation, save it with a new filename, and then add and 
delete slides and edit the existing slides.
When you create a presentation, it is important to keep in mind a few basic prin-
ciples for effective design. PowerPoint offers so many templates and designs that it is 
tempting to use many different layouts and formats in your presentation. But if your 
presentation is too busy, the formatting can detract from your content. You want the 
design features you choose to emphasize your content, not overwhelm it. Following 
are a few design guidelines to keep in mind when you are creating a presentation.
n 
Do not overload a slide with too much content; include only essential informa-
tion to keep your message clear and concise.
n 
Select only one or two fonts that are easy to read, and use the same fonts for the 
same features in all the slides in a presentation to create a consistent appearance.
n 
Use numbered lists to show the steps in a process or data that should be exam-
ined in order.

Mod2-369
n 
Use bullets to present lists of information.
n 
Limit the number of special features, such as bullets, numbered items, or 
­graphics, on a single slide.
n 
Use graphics or charts only to highlight relevant information. Do not use graph-
ics just to decorate a slide.
n 
Tables and charts can illustrate numerical data or trends, but keep the charts 
simple and easy to read.
n 
Add elements such as a company name for consistency from slide to slide.
When you create a new blank presentation, the file opens with one blank slide 
with a proposed slide layout. Slide layout refers to the arrangement of placeholders 
on the slide. The placeholders provide placement guides for adding text or objects 
such as pictures, tables, or charts. Most presentations begin with a title slide. You 
can choose from several different slide layouts. To modify the slide layout, you can 
resize the placeholders and move them to another position in the slide pane. If you 
do not use a placeholder, you can leave it empty, or you can delete it. An empty 
placeholder will not appear in Slide Show view or when the slide is printed.
To add text to a slide or to manipulate the text on a slide, the presentation must 
be shown in Normal view. You can add text in the placeholders in the slide pane, or 
you can add text in the Outline tab. When you fill a placeholder with several lines of 
text and keep entering text, PowerPoint reduces the font size as needed so all the text 
fits inside the text box. If there are not enough placeholders in the slide layout, you 
can add new text boxes.
As you type text in a placeholder, PowerPoint automatically checks for mis-
spelled words. However, you must also proofread all of your work because the 
spelling checker will not identify all spelling errors. The AutoCorrect feature is also 
available, and PowerPoint automatically corrects common spelling errors. For exam-
ple, when you type teh it is automatically corrected to the.
The Notes pane provides a place for you to write speaker notes that you can use 
to provide reminders about information you want to emphasize. The notes are not 
displayed on the slide when the presentation is shown in Slide Show view. There is 
plenty of space available for notes, so you can even include the dialogue you want to 
use when you present the slide show to an audience.

Page view, you can add graphics 
or other elements to the speaker

Applying a Theme
You can easily give your presentation a professional look by applying a theme, 
which specifies a color scheme, fonts, and effects. Each theme has a specific look 
and feel. The theme you choose for your presentation should reflect the tone of the 
presentation topic. Moreover, the theme should not detract from the message you 
want to deliver.
A theme is applied to all the slides, but the content of the slides does not change. 
You can apply a different theme at any time to change the look of your presentation. 
PowerPoint offers four variants for each theme, which provide predefined sets of 
theme colors. You can use the variants to change the color scheme of the theme 
without affecting the overall look of the theme. If the variants do not meet your 
needs, you can choose from a palette of theme colors. You can also change the set 
of theme fonts.

Editing Slides
As you work with a presentation, you will likely want to change the content of one 
or more of the slides. As you change the content of a slide, you may find you need to 
change the slide layout and the text formats. You also may want to add some univer-
sal elements to all the slides, such as a company name or logo. PowerPoint makes it 
easy for you to edit and manipulate the text and objects on a slide. If you accidentally 
delete contents, or if you change your mind, you can undo your edits. You can also 
redo an undo edit, and you can repeat previous actions.
When you add and edit text, the contents that are displayed on the Outline tab, 
the slides are automatically updated. You can also change the slide layout to accom-
modate the text you want to add. The content and formatting will remain intact; 
only the layout of the slide will change. You may find that if you select a layout that 
does not have placeholders for all the text and content in the original slide, elements 
of the slide may overlap. If so, you can move any placeholder and rearrange the 
elements of a slide.
When you use a theme, the format of the text on each of the slides is predeter-
mined. There may be occasions, however, when you want to alter the text format. 
You may want to change the font style or point size. Changing the color of the text or 
changing the font style can add emphasis to the slide content, but be sure you choose 
the font styles carefully, because sometimes the font style can make it difficult to 
read text. Use Live Preview to see the formatting effects before you apply them.
Step-by-Step 21.7
	 1.	 If necessary, open the file International 2 from your solution files. Save the 
International 2 presentation as International 3, followed by your initials.

the  first bulleted item Become a volunteer.. Notice the boundaries 
of the placeholder, as indicated by the dashed line and the sizing han-
dles, are selected. The placeholder is a text box, and all three bulleted 
items are in the text box.
	 3.	 Drag the selected text down and position the insertion point in front of 
the third bulleted item, then release the mouse button. The text Become 
a volunteer. is now the second bulleted item.

Click anywhere in the slide pane to deselect the text. The sequence 
should now be Become an exchange student., Become a host family., 
and Become a volunteer..

Working with Slide Masters
A Slide Master is added to your presentation when you apply a theme. A Slide 
Master is the main slide that stores information about the theme and layouts of the 
presentation. The information can include formatting, bullets, backgrounds, place-
holder positions, and even graphics (such as a company logo). The Slide Master 
ensures consistency on each slide. When you update one or more of the elements, 
such as the company logo, you can make a universal change and the edits will be 
reflected on all the slides in the presentation. You can view the Slide Master in Slide 
Master view.
The text on the Slide Master is only for styling. To include a company name in 
a footer on all slides, you need to create the content for the footer in Normal view 
using the Header and Footer dialog box. To change the font style, size, and color of 
text in a footer, you can make the changes in the Slide Master.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
In addition to using the Slides and Outline tabs and Slide 
Sorter view to move to a different slide, you can use the scroll 
bar, mouse, or keyboard to navigate through a presentation in 
Normal view.
n 
You work in either Normal view or Slide Sorter view as you 
create and edit your presentation. You use Slide Show view 
when you present the show to an audience.
n 
You can use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to delete, 
move, or copy slides in a presentation. You can also easily rear-
range the order of slides using drag-and-drop editing.
n 
To create an effective presentation, the design features for 
­layouts and formats should emphasize the content without 
overwhelming it. For example, use the same fonts for the same 
features in all slides for a consistent appearance, and limit the 
number of special features on a single slide.
n 
The slide theme automatically formats slides with color 
schemes, font styles, and effects. A theme ensures that all 
slides in a presentation have a consistent look. You can apply 
a theme at any time without affecting the underlying content 
of the slides.
n 
You can change the slide layout even when the slide contains 
content, and you can modify the slide layout by resizing and 
repositioning the placeholders.
n 
You can add elements such as a company logo to the Slide 
Master so the elements appear consistently on all slides. You 
can create a footer to display a company name or date on one 
or all slides in the presentation.
n 
In Slide Show view, the slides are displayed full screen, and 
you can move through the presentation using the mouse or 
keyboard.
n 
You can add annotations to slides and highlight text when 
showing slides in Slide Show view.
n 
So that only designated slides are displayed in Slide Show 
view, you can hide slides or create a custom slide show.
Career Communication Skills
Chances are that you have given some thought to the kind of career or job you want when you finish 
school. Are you interested in entering the corporate world, perhaps as an account manager in a ­marketing 
or advertising firm? Or maybe you have always wanted to teach in a classroom or train workers on the job. 
If you like science, you may be considering a career as a researcher for a large company or a ­university. 
In any of these careers, the individuals most likely to be promoted and succeed have something in 
­common—they have good oral and written communication skills. The ability to make formal presentations 
is an increasingly important skill for many different occupations. In fact, communication skills can greatly 
enhance one’s success in the classroom or on the job.
Many jobs require that an employee be able to organize, analyze, and communicate information. 
Moreover, employees are often called on to formally present information. For example, an account ­manager 
may use a presentation to pitch a new idea to a client. An instructor plans and presents material to 
other people every day. And a research scientist may be called on to report findings to colleagues, create 
a ­presentation on future projects for a grant application process, or even conduct a press conference to 
introduce a scientific breakthrough! The audience may be as small as one or two coworkers, or it may be a 
much larger group of people, and the presentation may be in person or on camera. In most cases, you will 
use some type of technology. To deliver an effective presentation, you must possess the technology skills 
and confidence to deliver an effective presentation.

  Teamwork Project
One of the best uses of a PowerPoint presentation is 
to persuade an audience to adopt a particular point of 
view. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 As a class, brainstorm some issues of interest to 
the entire class (such as a proposal for a new com-
munity park or bike path). Or, your instructor may 
have a list of issues already prepared.
	 2.	 Form groups of two learners who have different opinions on 
one topic. Each learner will create a slide show that presents 
their position.
	 3.	 Gather information on the issue from surveys or research, and 
then create a presentation to support your own particular point 
of view. Save the presentation as TP 21–1, followed by your 
initials.
	 4.	 Organize the slide content to emphasize your points clearly. 
Select a theme and slide layouts that present your information 
effectively.
	 5.	 Each team member will then present their argument, and class-
mates will critique each presentation for design, content, and 
persuasiveness.
Project 21–3
	 1.	 Open the file Search Tips from the drive and 
folder where your Data Files folder is stored. 
Save the Search Tips presentation as Revised 
Search Tips, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Change the slide 2 layout to the Title Only layout. 
Then insert a new blank slide after slide 2, using 
the same layout.
	 3.	 On the new slide 3, type Then, choose a tool… in the title 
placeholder. Then, using the Slides tab, move the new slide 3 
to become the fourth slide.
	 4.	 Apply a design of your choice. Change the color scheme, 
background, and theme fonts as desired.
	 5.	 Add the footer Internet Search Tips. Apply the footer to all 
slides. (Depending on the theme, you may not want to include 
the footer on the title slide.) Adjust the font size for the footer 
text on the Slide Master.
	 6.	 Preview each slide in the presentation in Slide Show view 
using the mouse button and the Page Down key, the Page Up 
key, and the down arrow and up arrow keys. Then use the menu 
to navigate to slide 7. Exit Slide Show view.
	 7.	 Create a custom slide show, using the default slide show name. 
Include only slides 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Preview each of the 
slides in the custom slide show, and then exit Slide Show view.
	 8.	 Save the changes, and then close the presentation.

  Critical Thinking
Critical Thinking 21–1
One of the files you worked with in this lesson, 3Rs, 
addressed the importance of knowing the rules of 
copyright law for the Internet. If a classmate copies 
pictures from Web pages and uses the pictures in a 
report for a class assignment, is the classmate violating copyright 
laws? Search the Internet for information about copyright laws, and 
then do the following:
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 21–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Explain why you think the classmate has or has not broken 
any copyright rules. Use the information gathered from your 
Internet search to support your argument. Be sure to respect 
those who provided the information at the Web site and give 
them credit by citing your sources!
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document.
2-1.2.1
Critical Thinking 21–2
The slide layout and design are essential for emphasizing the pre-
sentation content. Through your own experience, you can probably 
relate to viewing an ineffective slide show. To avoid making similar 
mistakes, consider the guidelines you should follow when creating 
your own presentations.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 21–2, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Describe at least three design elements that are essential for 
developing an effective presentation.
	 3.	 Save the changes, and close the document.

Module 2  Key Applications
  Online Discovery
To complete this activity, you will need permission to access files 
online and download a file.
In the Word lessons, you learned about using templates to cre-
ate documents. PowerPoint provides access to several templates to 
help you create professional-looking presentations. Not only do 
these presentation templates include preformatted designs, but some 
of them also include content that you can use as a guide as you 
create your own content. Some of these templates are provided by 
PowerPoint users like yourself.
	 1.	 In PowerPoint, click the FILE tab, and then click New. In 
the Search box at the top of the template gallery, type some 
key words such as Academic presentations, and then click the 
Search button to view available templates at Office.com. Or, 
you can click one of the links under the Search box.
	 2.	 Scroll through the thumbnails and select one of the templates 
that you think might be useful, and then click the thumbnail. 
A larger image of the thumbnail appears in the right pane, and 
customer ratings are provided above the image, which will 
help you decide if you want to download the template.
	 3.	 If permitted, click the Create button to download 
one of the templates and review the slides.
	 4.	 Review the slide contents and the theme used in 
the presentation.
	 5.	 Open a new Word document, and save the document as 
OD 21–1, followed by your initials. Write a brief paragraph 
about whether or not you think the template will be useful for 
future presentations, and explain why.
	 6.	 Save the changes, and close the document.
2-1.3.3
  Job Skills
In this lesson, you created several presentations. Choose one of your 
solution files (or another presentation file you have created), and 
review the content on each slide.
	 1.	 In Slide Show view, practice using the keyboard and mouse to 
navigate through the files.
	 2.	 Also practice using the pen tools.
2-1.1.1
2-1.3.6
	 3.	 Deliver the presentation in Slide Show view to 
your classmates. If there is not enough time to 
deliver the presentation to the class, ask a partner 
to watch the presentation.
  Explore And Solve
In Presenter View, you can see the notes on your screen, below 
the slide, while the audience only sees the slide. When enabled, 
Presenter view automatically adapts to the projection set-up, and you 
can use the feature with only one monitor. Explore how Presenter 
View works and then use the feature as you deliver a presentation.
	 1.	 In this lesson, you created several presentations. Choose one of 
your solution files (or another presentation file you have cre-
ated). Review the content on each slide, and then add notes to 
the Notes pane to help you prepare for the presentation.
	 2.	 Set up for projection.
	 3.	 Navigate through the slides in Slide Show view 
so you can see firsthand how the Presenter View 
feature works.

Mod2-392	
Module 2  Key Applications
A good presentation holds your audience’s attention without distracting them from 
comprehending the information you are presenting. PowerPoint allows you to use 
colors, designs, graphics, links, sound, and video to illustrate your information effec-
tively by emphasizing and clarifying your points.
Inserting and Formatting Graphics
Graphics can help your audience remember your message. Graphics include shapes, 
clip art, pictures, WordArt, SmartArt graphics, tables, and charts. PowerPoint pro-
vides special content placeholders in slide layouts to make the task of adding graph-
ics easy. But do not let your message get lost by overloading your slide show with 
the abundant special effects available. Use graphics only when they illustrate ­relevant 
points in a presentation.
Adding Pictures to a Slide
If you have an Internet connection open, you can insert clip art and photographs 
from a gallery of clip art files that Microsoft provides at Office.com. This is called 
inserting an online picture. There are also other Internet sources for clip art and 
photographs.
Another option is to insert a picture from a file, such as a digital photograph or 
a scanned image of a drawing. You can access pictures that you have saved on your 
computer or on SkyDrive, and you can also connect to Facebook, Flickr, and other 
sites to get your pictures.
The content placeholders simplify the task for inserting graphics. When you 
insert a graphic using a graphic button in a placeholder, the graphic replaces the 
placeholder, and the graphic will not exceed the height or width of the placeholder. 
When a graphic is selected, eight small squares and circles called sizing handles 
appear on the border of the graphic. When the graphic is selected, you can cut, copy, 
paste, delete, move, or resize it. To resize the graphic, drag a sizing handle and you 
will see the effect on the screen as you drag. To resize the graphic proportionally, 
drag a corner sizing handle. To remove portions of a graphic, you use the Crop 
command.
Step-by-Step 22.1
	 1.	 Start PowerPoint, and open the file Time Management from the drive 
and folder where your Data Files folder is stored. Save the Time 
Management presentation as Revised Time Management 1, followed by 
your initials.
	 2.	 Go to slide 3, a slide with the Two Content slide layout. Each of the 
content placeholders shows six different graphics buttons, as shown 
in Figure 22–1. Point to each of the graphics buttons to show the 
ScreenTips with the button names.

Adding WordArt, Shapes, and SmartArt  
Graphics to a Slide
You can also create WordArt objects and draw objects on a slide using the same 
drawing tools that you learned to use in Word. You can resize and reposition text 
boxes and shapes. SmartArt graphics enable you to convert text to a professional-
looking visual element. As you already know, SmartArt graphics provide a profes-
sional look and are easy to create. Applying styles, fill colors, borders, and effects to 
the objects will also add emphasis and create a professional look.

Adding Tables, Charts, and Text Boxes to Slides
You can add tables and simple charts to illustrate numerical data or trends. The 
placeholders make it easy to create a table or chart on a slide using features in Word 
and Excel with which you are already familiar.
If you have used all the placeholders on the slide and you want to add additional 
text to a slide, you can insert a text box. Adding styles, borders, and shape fills to text 
boxes can add emphasis to the text. PowerPoint provides several predefined styles, 
or you can choose your own text box fill colors, borders, and effects.

Creating Hyperlinks
In PowerPoint, you can create hyperlinks to slides in the same presentation, to slides 
in another presentation, or to an e-mail address, a Web page, or another file. You can 
create the hyperlink from text on a slide, and you can also create the hyperlink from 
a graphic object on a slide. Hyperlink formats, such as font colors before and after a 
followed link, are based on the presentation theme.
Hyperlinks are only functional in Slide Show view, and you can customize the 
ScreenTip that appears when you position the mouse pointer over the hyperlink text 
or object while in Slide Show view.

Formatting Slide Transitions
Slide transitions are settings that control how a slide is introduced as you move from 
one slide to another in Slide Show view. For example, you can format the transi-
tion so the current slide fades to black before the next slide is displayed. Or you 
can choose to have the next slide automatically appear after a designated number 
of ­seconds. You can even choose a sound effect that plays as the transition occurs. 
When used effectively, the transitions you add between the slides add interest and 
help keep the attention of your audience focused on the presentation. You can apply 
the transition settings to a single slide or to all the slides in the presentation.

Formatting Animations
When you add animation, you add special visual or sound effects to text or an 
object. Without animation, text and objects automatically appear all at once when a 
slide is opened in Slide Show view. However, when you format animations for the 
text boxes and graphics, you can control how and when the text and graphics appear 
on each slide.
Applying Animations
PowerPoint provides many built-in animations for four types of effects. Entrance effects 
control how the object enters onto the slide. Emphasis effects draw attention to an object 
that is already visible on the slide, and exit effects control how an object leaves the slide. 
Motion paths enable you to create a path for the object to follow on the slide, which 
you will practice in Step-by-Step 22.7. The animation options for each type of effect are 
organized in four categories: Basic, Subtle, Moderate, and Exciting. By default, a mouse 
click is the trigger, the instruction that starts the animation segment.

	14.	 Go to slide 4. Click the smiley face object to select it. Click the 
Add Animation button. Under Emphasis, click the Teeter animation. 
Preview the animation.
	15.	 Save the changes, and leave the presentation open for the next 
Step-by-Step.
Rearranging, Changing, and Customizing 
Animations
If you change your mind after applying animations, you can rearrange the order 
of animations, remove an animation, or change the existing animation. To change 
the animation effect, you must first remove the existing animation. If you apply 
a new animation effect without removing the existing animation, the new effect 
is added to the object. In other words, the object would have two animations, 
not one.
You can customize the animations by modifying the timing of the effects. For 
example, you can make text disappear very subtly by slowing down the duration of 
the animation, or you can make an object disappear with a much more dramatic exit 
by making it disappear quickly. You can also format delays before an animation is 
executed.
Step-by-Step 22.7
	 1.	 If necessary, open the file Revised Time Management 3 from your

Above and Beyond
Video and audio files can be 
quite large, so to avoid making 
the presentation file too large, 
you can create a link to the 
video/audio file. When you show 
the slide show, the link locates 
and reopens the video or audio 
file. Therefore, it is important 
that the link for the target file 
is maintained and the computer 
you are using for the slide show 
is able to access the target file.

Distributing Presentations
PowerPoint offers several options for distributing your presentation. Obviously, 
the primary way to distribute the presentation is to project the slide show before 
an audience. In addition, you can provide hard copies of slides, handouts, the 
presentation outline, and speaker notes. You can also distribute electronic copies 
(soft copies) of the presentation. Others who have access to the files can provide 
feedback by adding comments to the slides. If you are unable to make your pre-
sentation in person, you can instead share the presentation via e-mail, Web pages, 
or over networks.
Printing Handouts and Speaker Notes
You can print individual slides, the presentation outline, and speaker notes. You can 
also prepare handouts by formatting the slides in the various page layouts available 
in Word documents.
Step-by-Step 22.9
	 1.	 If necessary, open the file Revised Rescued Pets 4 from your solution 
files and save the Revised Rescued Pets 4 presentation as Revised 
Rescued Pets 5, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Go to slide 2. Click the REVIEW tab. In the Comments group, click the 
New Comment button. The Comments pane displays on the right side of

Module 2  Key Applications
Preparing Presentations for Electronic Distribution
When distributing electronic copies of the presentation, you must be connected to a 
network or the Internet, and you must have sufficient bandwidth for transferring the 
electronic files. Before sharing the presentation, you may want to control what oth-
ers can see in the file. For example, you may not want them to see the author of the 
presentation or the date the presentation was created. Information like this can easily 
be removed from the file by inspecting the file.
In Word and Excel, you learned how to save documents in PDF and XPS for-
mats. You can also save presentations in these formats. Readers can see the slides, 
but they cannot edit the slides or use them in a slide show.
You can share your presentations in the Cloud using your SkyDrive account. 
You can also present your slides online using Office Presentation Service, a new 
service that Microsoft offers all Office 2013 customers. You create a link so that 
others can view the presentation online. You must have a Microsoft account to start 
the online presentation. Another way to distribute a presentation is to publish the 
slides to a document management server or to a document workspace. To publish 
slides to a document management server or to a document workspace, you must have 
authorization to publish to or access files from a document workspace or document 
management server.
Quick Tip
A computer must be ­properly 
configured to output or receive 
and open PDF and XPS 
­documents. Microsoft provides 
a free add-in that you can 
­download so you can use the PDF 
and XPS formats.

Module 2  Key Applications
Respecting Intellectual Property
The term intellectual property is used to refer to information, material, or processes that were created by 
and belong to a person or corporation. Computers make it very easy to copy and disseminate art, docu-
ments, inventions, and music, and this has created many legal concerns about the rights of a creator.
Often people think that any information available on the Internet is in the public domain and free for 
the taking. This is not always the case. There are protections for intellectual property, including copyright 
for literary works, art, and music; patents for inventions and procedures; trademarks for company and 
product logos; and trade secrets, which include recipes, codes, and manufacturing processes. Be careful 
not to use protected material in your own work without securing permission from the person who owns the 
material. And when referencing this information in classroom assignments, give credit to those who own 
the material by citing sources in the slide show and in your presentation handouts.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Graphics help to clarify the message of your presentation. 
Graphics can help your audience remember your message, and 
PowerPoint makes it easy for you to add graphics to a slide.
n 
You can create WordArt, shapes, and SmartArt graphics to add 
visual effects to slides.
n 
You can easily reposition and resize graphics and text boxes 
on slides, and you can also format the objects with borders and 
shading.
n 
Placeholders make it easy to create a table or chart to illustrate 
numerical data or trends.
n 
You can add hyperlinks to text and graphics so you can link 
slides to other slides, other documents, or Web pages.
n 
The slide transition affects how each new slide appears. You 
can apply transition settings to a single slide or to all the slides 
in the presentation.
n 
PowerPoint provides special effects that can add emphasis, ani-
mation, or sound to the text and graphics, or that can enhance 
how a slide opens or closes.
n 
You can easily insert sound and video clips on slides and for-
mat the clips to play automatically.
n 
PowerPoint provides several options for distributing presenta-
tions via hard copies and electronic copies.

Module 2  Key Applications
A database is a collection of related information. Databases can contain all types 
of data—from an address list to schedules for a soccer tournament. Access is the 
Microsoft Office database application that enables you to organize, retrieve, and 
­analyze data in many ways.
You might wonder what the difference is between an Excel spreadsheet and 
an Access database. Actually, there are many similarities in both applications. 
Like spreadsheets, databases are composed of rows and columns. While both 
­applications enable you to organize, sort, and calculate the data, Access offers 
much more comprehensive functions for manipulating data. Access is a relational 
database ­management system. In a relational database, information is organized 
into separate subject-based tables, and the relationship of the data in one or more 
tables is used to bring the data together. For example, a relational database can 
be used to track the customers, orders, and inventory for a retail business. One 
table stores information about the customers, one table stores information about 
the customers’ orders, and yet another table stores product information. In Access, 
the information in the tables can be used to generate invoices based on customer 
orders. The invoices contain contact ­information from the customer table, as well 
as product details from the products table. If the business is planning to send out 
notices of a sale on a certain product brand, Access can quickly use the information 
in the orders table and the customers table to generate mailing labels for all those 
customers who have ­purchased products of that brand in the past.
Furthermore, in Access you can import or link data from other Access ­databases, 
Excel, Outlook, and many other data sources. And, Access data can be exported 
to many other data formats for use in other applications. Access is a powerful 
­application that offers many features, most of which are beyond the scope of this 
course. This lesson and Lesson 24 will introduce you to some of the basic features 
for viewing, entering, editing, querying, and reporting data.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions in the Access lessons generally provide directions for using a mouse 
to access commands and features. For example, the instructions may refer to actions 
such as point, click, double-click, or right-click. If you are using a touch screen, you 
can use gestures such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead of following the 
directions for using the mouse.
Identifying the Parts of the Access Screen
The Access screen is similar to other Office 2013 applications, with the title bar, 
Ribbon, Quick Access Toolbar, application window sizing buttons, Close button, 
and status bar. You can open only one database at a time using the Access Open 
­command. To open a new database in the application window, you will need to close 
the current database.
As in other Office applications, you can customize the application settings to fit 
your needs. For example, you can choose how many databases you want to display 
in the Recent Databases list in Backstage view.

	 2.	 In the Template gallery, click the Blank desktop database thumbnail. 
A dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 23–2 opens, proposing 
a name for the new database. Access automatically assigns the name 
Database and a sequential number, followed by the file type extension 
.accdb to each new database.
Step-by-Step 23.1
	 1.	 Open the Windows Start screen. If necessary, scroll through the Start

opening screen appears as shown in Figure 23–1. Recently accessed 
documents appear in the pane on the left, and templates for creating 
new databases appear in the Template gallery on the right. The Recent 
Database list and the templates available in your Template gallery may 
differ. The word desktop in the title will create traditional desktop 
­databases templates, which you will create in this lesson. The templates 
with a globe icon will create Access apps, which you will learn more 
about in Lesson 24.

Navigating the Objects in a Database
Unlike Word and Excel, Access does not have a standard document view. An Access 
database is composed of objects of several different types. The Access document 
window changes based on the object with which you are working. Table 23–1 
describes four basic objects (tables, forms, reports, and queries) that you will work 
with in this lesson and in Lesson 24. These objects help you organize and report the 
information that is stored in the database.

Creating a New Database
You can create a new database file using a blank database template or by using tem-
plates that are predefined with objects already created. In this lesson you will learn to 
create tables using the Blank desktop database template, and in Lesson 24 you will 
learn to create reports, forms, and queries. Then when you open a predesigned data-
base template, you will be familiar with all the elements of each type of object, and you 
will be able to modify and customize the objects as needed.
Saving a Database File and Creating a Table in 
Datasheet View
When you create a new database, the first step is to create a table. A table, often 
referred to as a datasheet, is the primary object in the database. Each of the objects 
and everything you do in a database relies on the data stored in the tables. Therefore, 
at least one table must be created before any additional objects can be created. You 
can create as many tables as you need to store the information.

Lesson 23  Getting Started with Access Essentials	
Mod2-441
A database table contains fields and records. A field is a single piece of database 
information, such as a first name, a last name, or a telephone number. Fields are 
displayed as columns, and each column has a field name, which is a label that helps 
identify the field. When you create a new field, you can choose a data type, which 
determines the type of data the field can store, such as text or numbers. A record is a 
group of related fields in a database, such as all the contact information for an indi-
vidual, including first and last name, address, postal code, telephone number, and so 
forth. When you create a table in Access, the default setting creates a primary key 
for each record, which uniquely identifies each record in the table. The primary key 
is useful in sorting records, and it prevents duplicate entries. For example, you may 
have a student ID number, and no other student has exactly the same number as you.
By default, a table opens in Datasheet view, and the table data is shown in a 
row-and-column format. In this view, the table looks much like a spreadsheet. One 
intersection of a row and a column is called a cell, just as in a table or a worksheet. 
Field names are used for column headings, and each row in the table contains one 
single record of the entire database.

Modifying a Database Table in Design View
The default column widths are often too wide or too narrow for the data in the 
table. This is the case with your database. The Address field is not wide enough 
to show all the text in the street address, and the ID field has extra white space. 
You can adjust the column widths in a database table just as you adjust the column 
widths in an Excel spreadsheet.
Adding and Deleting Fields
Often, after you create a table and enter data, you decide you want to add or delete 
fields. You can add fields in either Datasheet view or Design view. However, Design 
view provides features that make the task easier. Design view shows details about 
the structure of the object, including the data type and the field properties. Field 
properties define the characteristics and behavior of a field, such as the number of 
field properties characters allowed.

Changing Field Data Type and Field Properties
The default data type for a field is Short Text, which is appropriate for most of the 
fields in the Contacts table. However, for some fields, such as the Birth Date field, 
you may want to specify a Date/Time data type instead of Short Text. In Design 
view, you can specify the data type for each field. For example, you can specify Text, 
Number, Currency, and Yes/No.
When you choose a data type, you can also change the field properties. The field 
properties available depend on the data type selected. For example, the default Field 
Size property for the Short Text data type is 255 characters, but you can specify that 
the field allow up to only 50 characters. Most data types include a Format property. 
The Format property specifies how you want Access to show numbers, dates, times, 
and text.
Quick Tip
The Long Text field stores up to 
about a gigabyte (GB) of text and 
you can format Long Text fields to 
display Rich Text, which displays 
bold and underline formats.

It is common for data to change after you have entered it into your database. For 
example, people move, so you have to change their addresses. Access provides sev-
eral navigation features that make it easy for you to move around in a table to make 
necessary edits. You can hide fields to reduce the amount of data that displays in a 
table. These features are especially useful when you are working in large databases.
If you make a mistake adding or editing data in a record, you can choose the 
Undo command to reverse your last action. As soon as you begin editing another 
record, however, the Undo command is no longer available. That is because Access 
constantly saves the changes. As you experienced in the previous Step-by-Step, 
when you make changes in Design view and then switch to Datasheet view without 
first saving the object, Access prompts you to save the changes. However, when you 
work in Datasheet view, the changes are saved as they are made. When you switch 
from Datasheet view to a different view, or when you close the database, you are not 
prompted to save the changes because they were already saved.

Deleting and Copying Records and Fields in 
Datasheet View
Deleting records is similar to deleting rows in an Excel spreadsheet. To delete a 
record, you must first select the record. You can delete multiple records at the same 
time by selecting more than one row. However, in a database table, you cannot select 
non-adjacent cells, rows, or columns. After a record is selected, you can press the 
Delete key to remove the data. Take care, though. Once you have deleted a record, 
you cannot use the Undo command to restore it.
Selected data can also be copied or moved from one location in an Access table 
to a new location within the same table or to a different table. The Cut, Copy, and 
Paste commands you have used in other Office applications are also available in 
Access. Access stores cut or copied text in the Clipboard.
To remove a table field and all the data for the field, you delete the column, similar 
to how you delete a column in Excel. To change the sequence of the fields in the 
table, you can rearrange the sequence of the columns.

Database Security
Protecting data is more important than ever, and securing database systems is taken very seriously as 
networks are progressively opened to wider access, especially access to the Internet. Hackers are not just 
attacking large corporations to steal information such as credit card numbers. They are also attacking 
smaller organizations and accessing sensitive data such as financial transactions, medical records, and 
Social Security numbers.
To protect against such compromises, companies of all sizes depend upon several levels of security 
controls to protect the network, host, and applications used to store data. Specialists in implementing 
security measures are needed for the software development process as well as on an ongoing basis to 
anticipate and safeguard against threats.
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Many parts of the Access screen are similar to other Office 
2013 applications. However, Access also has different views to 
perform tasks unique to Access.
n 
You can customize the Access application settings to fit your 
needs.
n 
A database can have multiple tables, and all other objects are 
based on data stored in tables.
n 
A table can be modified after it is created, and you can add or 
delete fields in the table even after records have been entered. 
You can modify a table in Datasheet view or in Design view.
n 
You can easily switch between Design view and Datasheet 
view.
n 
In Design view, you can specify the data type and properties 
for each field. The field properties control the characteristics 
and behavior of a database field, such as the maximum number 
of characters.
Summary
n 
Access provides several navigation features that make it easy 
for you to move around in a table to make necessary edits. If 
you are working in a large database, you can hide fields to 
reduce the amount of data that displays in a table.
n 
Deleting records is similar to deleting rows in Excel. Once you 
have deleted a record, you cannot use the Undo command to 
restore it.
n 
Selected data can be copied or moved from one location to 
another in an Access table, or to another table, using the Cut, 
Copy, and Paste commands.
n 
To change the sequence of fields in a table, you rearrange the 
sequence of columns.

	 2.	 Determine the categories of statistics you need to gather for 
your database, such as players’ names, number of games com-
pleted in the current season, scores, and individual or team sta-
tistics for each game. Divide up the categories so you share the 
responsibility for gathering the data.

  Online Discovery
Contact information generally includes postal codes. If you mail a 
letter or a package without a postal code, the item must be manually 
sorted at the post office, and the delivery of the item can be delayed 
by several days. Furthermore, if the data for the postal code is incor-
rect, mailed documents and packages may be returned as undeliver-
able. So, how can you find a postal code or verify that the postal 
code you have in your record is correct? The United States Postal 
Service provides an online zip code lookup feature. You can search 
for zip codes by address, city, or company. You can also search for a 
list of all the zip codes within a city. The search results can verify a 
correct address and zip code, and the proper standard postal format 
for the address is also provided.

Module 2  Key Applications
As the amount of data in a database increases, it becomes more difficult to manage 
records and find information. Access has several useful features that help you work 
with larger databases. These features help you enter the data, order the data, find the 
data, and summarize and report the data.
Creating a Form
In the previous lesson, you entered data in an Access table. You can create a form, a 
database object that provides a more convenient way to enter and edit data. A well-
designed form can also make the process of entering data more efficient and more 
accurate. When you create a form, you add a new object to the database. Access 
offers two features that make the process quick and easy: the Form button and the 
Form Wizard.
Creating a Form Using the Form Button
You can create a form with a single click using the Form button. All the fields from 
the table or query are included on the form, and the form is predesigned. You can 
apply built-in designs, and if desired, you can modify the form layout and design 
using either Layout view or Design view.

Creating a Form Using the Form Wizard
You may not always want to include all the database fields on the form. To illus-
trate, consider the following scenario. You are working with a vendor database that 
includes contact information as well as data about past purchases, billings, and pay-
ments. You want to create a form to add new vendors to the database. You want 
the form to include only the fields related to contact information. The Form Wizard 
makes it easy to create a form with your preferences because it prompts you to select 
the fields and the form layout for the new form.
When you work with a form, you have three options for viewing the object. 
Table 24–1 describes the three options.

Sorting Table Data in Datasheet View
Databases typically contain numerous records. Organizing records in a specific 
order can help you access the data more quickly. You can sort text and numbers 
in either ascending or descending order. As you may recall, ascending order sorts 
alphabetically from A to Z and numerically from the lowest to the highest number. 
Descending order sorts alphabetically from Z to A and numerically from the highest 
to the lowest number.
If you change your mind after sorting the table data, you can use the Undo 
command to undo the action. You can also easily restore the table to its original 
arrangement.

Finding and Replacing Table Data
Sometimes, records contain common data, and that data needs to be updated. In 
a small database, you can locate specific data by scrolling through the records. 
However, if the database is quite large, finding a particular record or value can be 
tedious and time consuming. Whether the database has a few records, hundreds of 
records, or even thousands of records, using the Find and Replace commands simpli-
fies the task.
Finding Data
Assume you want to see if there are any books about Huckleberry Finn included 
in the Book Club database that you worked with in Step-by-Step 24.1. You could 
sort the records in the Book List table in alphabetical order by title and then scroll 
down through the list to look for the title. However, if the database had hundreds or 
thousands of records, scrolling through the records to find the title could take a lot 
of time. The Find command provides a quick and easy way for you to locate specific 
records or find certain values within fields. You can search for data within a specific 
field, or you can search the entire table.
Step-by-Step 24.5
	 1.	 Open the Updated Book Club 1 database from your solution files.
	 2.	 Open the Book List table.
	 3.	 Position the insertion point in the first row in the Title column. Be care-
ful, though, not to select any text in the cell. In the Find group on the 
HOME tab shown in Figure 24–8, click the Find button 
.

	 5.	 Compare your screen to Figure 24–9. Change the options, if necessary, 
to match the following:
	 a.	 The setting in the Look In box already displays Current field. This 
option is correct as is. It tells Access to look for all occurrences 
in the field where the insertion point is positioned. (To search 
the entire table, you would click the list arrow and select Current 
document.)
	 b.	 If necessary, click the Match box list arrow, and select Any Part 
of Field. Access will locate any book title that has the words 
Huckleberry and Finn in it.
	 c.	 If necessary, select All in the Search box.
	 d.	 The Match Case and the Search Fields As Formatted options 
should not be selected. If they are selected, click the option once 
to uncheck the box and disable the option. When these options are 
turned off, Access ignores capitalization and data formats when 
searching for matching text.

no more occurrences of the search text. Click OK in the message box to 
close the message. Leave the Find and Replace dialog box open.

	11.	 Press Shift+F4. Even though the Find and Replace dialog box is closed, 
the keyboard shortcut used the search criteria from the previous search 
and located the first occurrence in record #7.
	12.	 Press Ctrl+F to open the Find tab in the Find and Replace dialog box. 
The previous search text is already highlighted in the Find What box. 
Type Bronte. Click the Search box list arrow, and then click Up. Click

The first occurrence of Bronte moving downward in the table is selected 
(record #12). Close the dialog box.
	14.	 Close the Book List table, and leave the database open for the next 
Step-by-Step.
Using the Replace Command
The Replace command locates the search text and replaces it with new text that you 
specify. For example, in the Classics field in the Book Club database, there is no 
consistency in the spelling of the word “Incorporated.” Sometimes it is spelled out 
completely, and sometimes the abbreviation “Inc.” appears. You can search for all 
the occurrences when the word is abbreviated and then automatically replace those 
abbreviations with the complete spelling, or vice versa.
When you use the Replace command, you can choose to view and confirm each 
replacement individually. If you change your mind, you can use the Undo command 
to reverse the replace action; however, you must choose the Undo command before 
editing another record. You can also choose to replace all occurrences of the search 
text with a single click. You should use the Replace All option only when you are 
confident about making all the replacements without reviewing them first.
Step-by-Step 24.6
	 1.	 If necessary, open the Updated Book Club 1 database from your solu-
tion files. Save the Updated Book Club 1 database as Updated Book 
Club 2, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Open the Book List table. Position the insertion point at the beginning 
of the text in the first record in the Publisher column. Be careful not to 
select the contents in the cell.

Creating a Query
Although the Find command provides an easy way to find data, you only see the 
search results for one record at a time. You may need to locate multiple records, all 
containing the same values. If you have a large database, and several records contain 
the value you are searching for, this is another task that can be tedious.
Remember, you learned in Lesson 23 that a query is one of the types of database 
objects that appear in the Navigation Pane. A query enables you to locate multiple 
records matching specified criteria. The query provides a way for you to ask a ques-
tion about the information stored in one or more database tables. Access searches for 
and retrieves data from the table or tables to answer your question.
To illustrate the benefits of using a query, consider the following example. 
Suppose you just read a book by Charles Dickens. You really enjoyed the book and 
you would like to read another book authored by him. You could locate the books 
by Charles Dickens one at a time in the Book Club database by using the Find 
­command. But a query makes your search easier, and it also creates a list of the 
titles for you.
When you create a query, you must identify all the fields for which you want 
to retrieve and show information. For example, you might want to retrieve records 
and show only the title and the author name. The order in which you select the fields 
will be the order in which the information appears in the query results. The easiest 
way to create a query is to use the Query Wizard, which guides you through most 
of the process.

Creating a Report
You can print a database in Datasheet view, but when you do, all of the data con-
tained in the database is printed. This can waste a lot of paper if the database is large 
or if you need only certain information from the database. A report is a database 
object that allows you to organize, summarize, and print all or a portion of the data in 
a database. You can create a report based on a table or a query.
Although you can prepare a report manually, the Report Wizard provides an 
easy and fast way to create a report. The wizard prompts you to specify the data you 
want to include in the report and how you want to format that data. One of the format 
options you apply in the report is page orientation. Remember, you learned in earlier 
lessons that the orientation determines how the report will be printed on the page. 
Landscape orientation formats the report with the long edge of the page at the top; 
portrait orientation formats the report with the short edge of the page at the top.
In Design view, you can format headers and footers using page numbers, titles, 
and dates and time. You can also add graphics to the header or footer, such as a logo.

Printing a Report
You already used the Print Preview feature to view how a document will print. Print 
options in Backstage view are not the same as for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. 
However, there are still several options you can choose in the Print dialog box.  
For example, if the report has multiple pages, you can choose which pages to print. 
You can also choose the number of copies to print. And, you can change the margin 
settings before you send the data to the printer.

Creating Mailing Labels
Because databases often contain data regarding names and addresses, it is common 
to create mailing labels based on the database information. For example, you can 
quickly create labels for the vendors or suppliers in the GO Construction database. 
Access provides a wizard to use a report format to create the labels. When you use 
the Label Wizard, you can customize the layout of the fields that controls how the 
data appears on the label.
The Label Wizard includes a step to sort the database records. For bulk mail 
rates, the mail must be sorted by postal code, so sorting the labels before printing 
saves a lot of time.

Sharing Database Files
In this lesson and in Lesson 23, you have been working with traditional desktop 
databases. Unlike other Office 2013 applications, the traditional desktop databases 
created in Access 2013 do not include features for sharing desktop databases. To 
share an Access database using SkyDrive or the Cloud, you must use an Access app 
to create the database so that you can publish it online.
Templates for the Access app are accessible in the Access startup screen. The 
templates with a globe icon will create Access apps; the templates with the word 
desktop in the title will create traditional desktop databases. If you want to design an 
app on your own, you can click the Custom web app template. To create an Access 
app, you will need Access 2013 and SharePoint Server 2013 or an Office 365 site, 
which is beyond the scope of this lesson.
Even though you cannot track changes or add comments to table cells in a tra-
ditional desktop database, you can create a Comment table in a database. Users can 
then add comments in the table and review comments from other users.
You can share database files via e-mail by attaching a database file to an e-mail 
message. To prevent unauthorized access to a database file, you can encrypt the file 
by setting a password. To encrypt (and decrypt) a database file, you must open the 
file in Exclusive mode using the Open dialog box.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
You can create a form object using the Form button or the 
Form Wizard. The Form Wizard helps you create a customized 
layout for entering data.
n 
Entering and editing data in a form is similar to entering data in 
a table in Datasheet view. You use the same navigation buttons 
to move from one record to another.
n 
You can sort records in Datasheet view in either ascending or 
descending order.
n 
The Find command can save you time looking for records and 
specific values in a table. The Replace command can save you 
time finding and replacing specific text. You can choose to 
replace text in individual occurrences or all at once.
n 
You can create a query to find field data for records that match 
specified criteria.
n 
A report allows you to organize, summarize, and print all or a 
portion of the data in a database. You can insert, reposition, and 
resize logo graphics in the header and footer panes.
n 
After creating a report using the Report Wizard, you can review 
the report in Print Preview before sending it to the printer.
n 
When you want to create mailing labels, you create a report 
object using the Label Wizard.
n 
To add comments to a database, you can create a Comments 
table.
n 
To prevent unauthorized access to a database file, you can 
encrypt the file.
Data Entry Keyers
The amount of information that businesses maintain continues to grow, and this information needs to be 
entered into a database. If you are a fast and accurate keyboarder, have a good eye for detail, and enjoy 
working at the computer all day, a data entry job might be the right career choice for you. In addition to 
entering data, data entry keyers verify the accuracy of the data they enter. They proofread entries, perform 
accuracy tests, correct errors, and compile and sort data. Accuracy is emphasized; inaccurate data means 
inaccurate records, and errors can cost the business a lot of money.
Data entry keyers are employed in every sector of the economy. Primary employers include data 
­processing firms; accounting, auditing, and bookkeeping firms; banks and credit unions; and state and 
local governments. Typical job titles include billing clerk, accounting clerk, production clerk, data entry 
operator, and key data operator. Many data entry keyers work regular workdays, but they can work from 
remote locations with flexible hours as well. A data entry job can help you get your foot in the door with 
an employer, and then you can work your way up to a better paying job with more responsibilities.

Critical Thinking 24–1
In Projects 24–1, 24–2, and 24–3, you worked with a 
database for a community volunteer program. The pro-
gram manager wants to recognize the youth volunteers. How can the 
Volunteers table data be arranged so the program manager can easily 
identify those volunteers who are under 18 years old?
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 24–1, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Write two or three sentences explaining how you would manip-
ulate the table data to help the manager.
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document.
Critical Thinking 24–2
As you know, databases are not just for storing data. Databases are 
also used as tools for analyzing and organizing data. To ensure that 
the database meets your needs, a lot of thought must go into the 
planning before the database is created.
	 1.	 Create a new Word document, and save the document as 
CT 24–2, followed by your initials.
	 2.	 Create a list of steps you would follow in planning the fields to 
include in a database.
	 3.	 Save the changes to the document.

Networking means communicating, and modern society depends daily on communi-
cation networks to exchange information and share ideas. Users connect to networks 
quickly, or even automatically, and then they access data almost instantly. But have 
you ever thought about what goes on behind the scenes to make this possible?
Communication Networks
Society uses many different networks for communication purposes. The networks 
are used to transmit voice, data, video, and Internet traffic. Multi-service networks are 
capable of transmitting a combination of these services on the same system. Some 
communication networks support public use, and some networks are designed for 
private use. See Figure 25–1.
3-2.2.1

Figure 25–1  Sharing Information
Comparing Public vs. Private Networks
Public networks offer access to the general public with a connection to other net-
works. For example, coffee shops, airports, and hotels provide public networks so 
that guests can access other networks, typically the Internet. The Internet is a public 
global network that enables users worldwide to connect and exchange information.
A public switched network (PSN) is a common carrier network that provides 
connections among public users. The term PSN is usually applied to the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN), the international collection of interconnected 
voice-based public telephone networks. To create the connection, the system sets 
up a dedicated channel (or circuit) between two points for the duration of the call. 
The calls are routed on all levels: local, regional, national, and international. PSTN 
was originally created to support one-to-one voice communications using analog 
transmissions, but the network today is largely digital and includes services for both 
cellular and landline phones. See Figure 25–2.

Figure 25–2  The PSTN routes calls on all levels
Many, but not all, local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are connected to the 
PSTN. ISPs employ a range of more advanced technologies to enable consumers to 
connect to a network. For example, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) can 
send voice, video, and data over digital or analog telephone lines. Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) is a system that converts your telephone signal into digital and uses 
the Internet to deliver voice communications. 
Private networks are owned by one or more establishments for their exclusive 
use. Private networks are commonly used in offices and homes so that multiple com-
puters can share printers, files, data, and programs. Private networks restrict access, 
and only authorized users can connect to a private network. For example, organiza-
tions use private networks to interconnect locations such as production sites, retail 
stores, office locations, and remote offices in order to share computer resources. 
Users must enter user names and passwords to gain access to the network.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network service that enables remote users 
to use a public network (usually the Internet) to access their private networks (usu-
ally a home or office network). VPN is a technology that encrypts incoming and 
outgoing data and uses a secure connection across a public network. VPN services 
are commonly used by employees who work at home, on the road, or in a branch 
office of a corporation.
Quick Tip
VoIP is also referred to as 
Internet Telephony.

Understanding Types of Networks
The design of a network, including how it is set up physically, is referred to as the 
architecture. Networks can be categorized by the scope of the network (the area 
covered by the connected devices) and the design of the communication methods. 
Networks can have wired or wireless connections, or both. Table 25–1 describes 
several types of networks.
3-2.2.4
Table 25–1  Network Types
Network
Description
Local area network (LAN)
Connects computers, workstations, and other devices that are rela-
tively close to each other, such as printers and scanners within a 
confined space, such as an office building, school, or home. 
Wireless local area ­network (WLAN)
A variation of the LAN without physical wires to connect devices. 
To communicate on a WLAN, the computer and other devices that 
access the network must each have a wireless device or built-in 
wireless capability. WLANs connect devices that are very close to 
each other, such as homes and small offices. See Figure 25–3. 
Wide area network (WAN)
A network that contains a substantial number of computers and 
covers a large geographical area (a state, country, or even the 
world). Most WANs consist of two or more LANs. The largest WAN is 
the Internet. Users usually connect through a public network such 
as a telephone system, leased lines, or satellites. See Figure 25–4. 
Client/server
In this type of architecture, one or more computers on the network 
act as a server. The server manages network resources, such as a 
mail server, a ­database server, a Web server, and so on. The com-
puter providing the ­service is the server, and the computer that 
requests and uses the service is the client. 
Peer-to-peer (P2P)
In this network design, all the computers are equal and no 
­computer is designated as the server. All computers can act both 
as a client and a server. Users on the network each determine what 
files on their computer they share with others on the network. 
Internet
A worldwide system composed of thousands of smaller networks. An 
Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides connection to the Internet. 
The Web and electronic mail are two of the more popular compo-
nents of the Internet. 
Intranet
This type of network is designed for the exclusive use within an 
organization. Many businesses have implemented intranets so that 
employees can access documents such as handbooks, employee 
manuals, newsletters, employment forms, and other relevant com-
pany documents. 
Extranet
Similar to an intranet, this type of network allows specific users 
outside of the organization access to internal information systems in 
an intranet.

Identifying Network Components
Many components and technologies work together so that networked computers can 
share data and access resources. The components vary depending on the network 
size and the transmission methods.
When most people think of networks, they envision something fairly compli-
cated. However, at the lowest level, networks are not that complex. In fact, a com-
puter network can be as simple as two computers linked together. The network can 
also include printers, scanners, and other devices to communicate and share infor-
mation. As the size of a network increases and more devices are added, installing 
devices and managing the network becomes more technical. Even so, networking 
concepts and terminology basically remain the same, regardless of size or type.
A server provides a service to one or many clients, such as sharing files, folders, 
and printers. In most instances, the server is a high-speed computer with consider-
able storage space. Depending on the size of the network, several servers might be 
connected. A client accesses the shared resources, services, and programs provided 
by the server. Access to the server can be through desktop or laptop computers, note-
books, tablets, handheld devices, game systems, and other similar electronic devices. 
See Figure 25–5.

users in areas that cable and DSL 
service providers do not serve. It 
is also used to connect mobile 
computer users to the Internet 
across cities and countries. You 
can use a WiMAX USB modem to

Commonly used communication devices are described next.
Modems
A modem enables a computer to transmit data over telephone lines. Computer infor-
mation is stored digitally (in binary code of 0s and 1s), whereas information sent 
over telephone lines is transmitted in the form of analog waves. See Figure 25–7.
n 
A traditional modem is often referred to as POTS (short for Plain Old Telephone 
Service).
n 
A cable modem uses existing cable television lines to send and receive data. The 
bandwidth, which determines the amount of data that can be sent at one time, 
is much greater with a cable modem than with the older technology of a dial-up 
modem. For this reason, cable modems are used to deliver broadband Internet 
access, which is a high-speed connection to the Internet.
n 
A digital subscriber line (DSL) modem uses an Internet connection technology 
that provides for the transfer of information to a computer at a high-speed band-
width over ordinary copper telephone lines. A DSL service can transmit both 
data and voice at the same time. Like cable modems, DSL modems are widely 
used to provide broadband Internet access.

Cable Media
There are three types of cable media: coaxial cable, twisted pair, and fiber optic 
cable. An Ethernet cable is the most common type of connection computers used in 
a local area network (LAN). An Ethernet port looks much like a regular phone jack, 
but it is slightly wider. This port can be used to connect your computer to another 
computer, to a local network, or to an external DSL or cable modem.

Mod3-11
T-1 Line
A T-1 line is a type of fiber-optic telephone line that can transmit voice and data at 
the same time. T-1 lines are ideal for businesses because the line is a dedicated line 
and not shared with other businesses. Hence, the connection is more secure and it 
doesn’t get bogged down.
Hub
A hub is a device that joins all the devices of a network together. Hubs are com-
monly used to connect segments of a LAN. Every network device connects directly 
to the hub through a port. When a frame of data arrives from a connected device, the 
hub forwards the frame to all the other connected devices.
Switch
A switch is a device that performs the same tasks as a hub, but it works much faster. 
Instead of sending the frame of data to all connected devices, a switch filters the 
target for the frame and forwards the frame only to a specific device in the LAN. 
Switches improve the response time and dissect irrelevant traffic from the seg-
ment. Switches have replaced most hubs in Ethernet networks. A switch can be a 
hardware or a software component, or a combination of both.
Router
A router directs the flow of data from a local area network (LAN) to another net-
work connection, either a LAN or a WAN. For example, a router links a computer 
in a home network to the Internet. The router breaks down the data into packets and 
identifies the best path for forwarding the packet to the specific target. If you have a 
router, you do not need a hub or switch. See Figure 25–8.

In discussions about networks, 
someone might mention 
bridges, which are also network 
components. A bridge connects 
two segments of a network and 
monitors the data traffic on both 
sides of the network. Bridges can 
be wired or wireless, but they are 
seldom used in modern networks. 
If you use the network bridge 
software built into Windows, 
you don’t need to buy additional 
hardware.

Network Interface Card (NIC)
A Network Interface Card (NIC) makes the electrical and electronic connections 
between a computer and a network. NICs are usually built into the computer mother-
board, or they are installed as an expansion card. NICs are used to set up both wired 
and wireless connections. A wired connection uses a cable; a wireless connection 
uses a small antenna and communicates via radio waves. See Figure 25–9.

Software Components
Software is used to set up, manage, and monitor communication networks. The 
application or program provides remote access to networks and the tools you need 
to transmit data in the required formats. Commonly-used software components are 
described next.
Protocols
In order for computers to communicate, they must use a protocol. A ­communications 
protocol is a description of the rules computers must follow to facilitate device iden-
tification and data transfer.
The most common communications protocol is Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), used for transporting data between computers on the 
Internet. TCP takes care of the communication between your application software 
(browser) and your network software. IP takes care of the communication with other 
computers.

Operating Systems
Operating systems often contain built-in services that support network protocols and 
include special functions for connecting computers and other devices into a network. 
The network operating system software and network versions of software applica-
tions are stored on the server. For example, a print server manages the printing and a 
database server manages a large database.
Three of the more popular server operating systems are Microsoft Windows, 
Mac OS X, and Linux. The selection of an operating system is determined by several 
factors including how the server will be accessed, security issues, whether the server 
will host a database, whether forms will be processed, which applications will be 
used, and other individual aspects.
Addressing
Each computer or device on a network has an address, a unique identifier. The 
­purpose of network addressing is two-fold. Addresses provide information for 
the identification of a device on the network, and addresses enable users to locate 
other devices that are connected to the network.
Every NIC has a Media Access Control (MAC), an address for communications 
on the physical network segment. A MAC address is assigned by the manufacturer 
of the device.
Devices connected to a TCP/IP network are assigned an IP address. An 
IP  address identifies the host device and the network to which it belongs. IP 
addresses are usually assigned by the network administrator or the Internet service 
provider. See Figure 25–10.
◗  Vocabulary

Figure 25–10  MAC address and IP address
Most networks use the Internet Protocol (IP) technology to share data and 
resources. Before a computer can access data, the computer address must be trans-
lated into an IP address. When you enter a Web address in a browser, the Internet 
Service Provider accesses a Domain Name Server (DNS), which maintains a direc-
tory of domain names and their correlated IP addresses. The DNS translates the Web 
address to an IP address and directs your Internet connection to the Web site.
Gateways
A gateway connects networks using different communications protocols so that 
information can be passed from one network to the other. The gateway converts 
data to a form that is compatible with the destination network and then transmits 
the data. For example, in homes the gateway to the Internet is the Internet Service 
Provider. A network gateway can be software, hardware, or a combination of both.
Packet Switching
Most networks use packet switching techniques to send and receive data. Packet 
switching splits data into manageable packets (small pieces), allowing a more effi-
cient flow in the transmission of the data. The NIC breaks down the data into packets 
before transmitting it to the hub. After the data packets are transmitted to the destina-
tion device, the NIC on the destination device puts the packets back together.

Identifying the Benefits of a Network
Computer networks are an integral part of our lives. Many changes have occurred in 
our society in the last several years because of the Internet and other network capa-
bilities. See Figure 25–11.
Figure 25–11  Network benefits
abalcazar/iStockphoto; TARIK KIZILKAYA/iStockphoto; killerbayer/iStockphoto; dmbaker/iStockphoto
Benefits of using networks are listed below.
n 
Enhanced communications: Electronic mail, text messages, social media, face-
to-face, and other electronic communications have changed the way the world 
interacts.
n 
Information sharing: Users around the world can connect to each other to access, 
share, and exchange information. Authorized users can access computers on the 
network to share information, data, and other resources. People share informa-
tion through special group projects, news groups, databases, blogs, Web casts, 
Internet telephony, instant messaging, social media, and so on.
n 
Searching and Researching: Before the Internet, students had to make a trip to the 
library and search for information in encyclopedias. Travelers had to use printed 
maps to get directions for destinations. Information is now easily accessible from 
a computer or a mobile device. The Internet provides an astronomical number of 
resources for finding information such as news, locations, directions and maps.
n 
E-commerce: The Internet enables business owners to run their businesses 
online from desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or smart phones. Not only can 
businesses market their products and services, they can also complete sales 
transactions and shipping orders using Internet connections.
n 
Online training: Online courses are convenient and offer flexibility. You can 
learn at your own pace and complete the training on your own schedule. You can 
remain competitive in the workplace without taking time off from work. You 
can also save money because you don’t have the costs of traveling to and from 
campus.

n 
Telecommuting: Not only does the ability to work from your home office save 
time traveling, it also saves expenses for transportation. Communication net-
works enable you to share files and connect with colleagues via video and con-
ference calls and Web casts.
n 
Collaborative environment: A shared environment enables users to exchange 
files and collaborate on group projects by combining the power and capabilities 
of diverse equipment and software, thus increasing personal productivity.
n 
Hardware sharing: It is not necessary to purchase a printer or a scanner or other 
frequently used peripherals for each computer. Instead, one device connected to 
a network can serve the needs of many users.
n 
Software sharing: Instead of installing software on every computer, it can be 
installed on the network server. All of the users can then access the program 
from this one central location. Software sharing saves money because com-
panies can purchase a site license for their users. This practice is less expen-
sive than purchasing individual software packages, and updating software on 
the server is much easier and more efficient than updating it on individual 
computers.
n 
Entertainment: Networks facilitate many types of games and entertainment, and 
the Internet also offers many sources of entertainment. Many home networks 
that are set up for entertainment and gaming across wide area networks, such 
as the Internet, have become popular.
Evaluating the Risks of Networked 
Computing
As with any technology, you should also consider the disadvantages of using a net-
work. The security of a computer network is challenged every day. See Figure 25–12.

n 
Privacy: As data traffic flows through a number of systems and networks, 
computers are vulnerable to unauthorized access. Hackers steal services and 
information.
n 
Malfunctions and system failures: Natural disasters such as storms and fires, as 
well as electrical disturbances such as blackouts can cause server malfunctions, 
and as a result, users temporarily lose access to network resources, such as 
shared files and printers.
n 
Malicious code: Network computers are vulnerable to viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, etc., which can cause equipment malfunctions and system failures. 
Malware protection helps alleviate these issues.
n 
Individual loss of autonomy: Networks can play a part in taking away an indi-
vidual’s autonomy by controlling which software programs are accessible, and 
keeping a record of how the computer is used and what sites are accessed.
n 
Network faults: Network equipment problems can result in loss of data and 
resources.
n 
Setup and management costs: Setting up a network requires an investment in 
hardware and software. Ongoing maintenance and management of the network 
requires the care and attention of a least one IT professional.
Solving Network Connection Problems
We live in a society that depends on communication networks for daily activities 
like work, entertainment, education, social interaction, traveling, and anything else 
that we have to do. It is very frustrating when we cannot connect to the Internet or 
access shared files or a shared printer. Solving hardware or software issues may be 
complex and require technical support. However, some connection problems such as 
physical connections and network settings are easy to identify and fix. Obviously, 
you should first check the physical connections. Make sure all cables are properly 
connected between your computer and modem/router. 
If everything seems to be connected correctly, power down all the devices, and 
unplug the power to your router and modem. Wait about 10–15 seconds and then 
plug in the router and modem and turn your computer on again.
If that doesn’t solve the problem, Windows provides troubleshooter wizards 
to help you diagnose and repair specific network problems. After diagnosing a 
problem, the wizard may fix the problem automatically, or the wizard may provide 
suggestions to fix the problem, such as search and help support, acquiring remote 
assistance, or online support. To access the troubleshooter wizards, you may need to 
have administrator access.

Network Administrators
Network administrators play a vital role in any business or organization that relies on network communica-
tions for daily operations. Network administrators are responsible for managing local area networks and 
wide area networks, as well as other online functions for a business. In addition to maintaining the organi-
zation’s hardware and software components, they also troubleshoot problems and ensure network security.
Preparation to become a network administrator includes both training and hands-on experience. 
Numerous technology certifications validate one’s knowledge and abilities. As technology evolves, the 
­certification requirements change, so network administrators should be prepared to continuously update 
their credentials.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Communication networks are used to transmit voice, data, 
video, and Internet traffic. Communication networks are cre-
ated for both public and private use.
n 
A computer network is a group of two or more computers 
linked together. As the size of a network increases, the network 
becomes more technical, but the networking concepts and ter-
minology basically remain the same.
n 
There are several types of networks. Networks can be catego-
rized by the scope of the network and the design of the com-
munication method.
n 
Communication networks require hardware components. 
Multiple devices can connect to a network via wired or wire-
less connections.
n 
Software components provide remote access to networks and 
the tools needed to transmit data in the required formats.
n 
Society has benefitted in many ways because of developments 
in the Internet and network capabilities in the last several 
years.
n 
Network connections also present challenges, and we should 
evaluate the risks when we access networks.
n 
Although some connection problems are complex and require 
technical support, Windows provides troubleshooter wizards to 
help diagnose and repair network problems.

Module 3  Living Online
Communication is the process of exchanging information. Traditional means of 
communication media include telephone, newspaper, and television. Technology 
developments have provided new communication media for interacting and sharing 
information, and the achievements have changed the way the world does business 
and the way we live our lives.
Describing Components of Electronic 
Communication
Electronic communication is the technology that transmits text, numbers, voice, and 
video from one computer or device to another. Today’s electronic communication 
requires a user agent which is a software application such as e-mail, text message, 
or an instant messaging program. The computer sending the message is the sender. 
The computer or device receiving the message is the receiver. The media that car-
ries or transports the message, such as the radio signal or the coaxial cable, is called 
the channel. Protocols are the rules that govern the transfer of data and ensure that 
information created by one system can be interpreted and read by another. The com-
munication is completed when the information is transferred between user agents.
Identifying Internet Communication Services
As a worldwide electronic communications system, the Internet provides many com-
munication services to billions of users. Wireless connections to the Internet enable 
users to access these communication services using mobile devices such as smart-
phones and tablets. The Internet provides a wide range of services including the 
following:
n	
E-mail (electronic mail) enables you to combine numerous media—text, graph-
ics, sound, video—into a single message, and then quickly exchange informa-
tion in dynamic, two-way communications.
n	
You use instant messaging services to send and receive messages in real time 
while you and someone else are both connected to the Internet.
n	
Instead of using a computer to communicate, text messaging (often referred to 
as texting) enables you to send short messages from one cell phone to another, 
or from the Web to a cell phone.
n	
Voice over IP (VoIP) is a methodology and group of technologies that transport 
voice, data, and video communications using Internet Protocol (IP) networks, 
such as the Internet.
n	
Online conferencing, also referred to as video conferencing, uses computer net-
works to transmit audio and video data so that two or more participants can 
conduct a conference at different sites.
n	
Chat rooms are Web sites that allow real-time communication so you can 
exchange messages with others through the computer. After you submit text 
typed on your computer, your submitted text displays on the other person’s 
monitor.
n	
Social networking sites are Web sites that provide a way to build online com-
munities of people who share common interests or activities.
n	
A blog (short for Web log) is a type of personal journal created by one person or 
by a group. Entries are published in reverse chronological order.
n	
Message boards and newsgroups provide bulletin board systems that serve as 
discussion sites; users can post messages asking for assistance.

Lesson 26  Communication Services	
Mod3-25
Using E-Mail Communication
As technology evolves and continues to provide new and enhanced methods of 
electronic communications, e-mail is still widely used. E-mail is similar to regular 
mail. You have a message, an address, and a carrier that transfers the message from 
one location to another. You can exchange communications within an organization 
network, or you can use an Internet service provider to send e-mail to any computer 
in the world. Unless a technical problem occurs, e-mail travels much faster than reg-
ular mail (sometimes referred to as “snail mail”). When the correspondence requires 
a paper or electronic trail, covers multiple points, or needs to be accessed frequently, 
e-mail communication will meet those needs.
Since e-mail has become a widespread means for communicating in our busi-
ness and personal lives, the methods used to access e-mail have multiplied. Many 
Web sites and Internet service providers offer e-mail as part of a monthly fee, or 
even at no charge. Microsoft Outlook.com, Windows Live Mail, Google Gmail, 
and Yahoo Mail are examples of Web-based e-mail services. The Web site often 
directs you to a built-in e-mail program where you can read, send, and manage 
messages.
Billions of people use the Internet, and each is required to have unique identifi-
cation, in the same way that each person has a unique phone number. When you set 
up an e-mail account, the service provider requires credentials before you can access 
the service features. Credentials include information to authenticate your identity 
when you log on to a Web site or an Internet service, such as a username and a pass-
word. Your credentials are stored on the server of the e-mail provider, which enables 
you to access the service.
A username is a name that identifies you when you log on to a Web site or 
an Internet service. The name could be your full name, a part of your name, or a 
fictitious name. Usually online accounts use your e-mail address as the username. 
Once you create a username, no one else can then use that username through that 
same service provider. To give your username a unique twist, consider adding an 
underscore, a symbol, or some numbers. However, for security, do not use numbers 
that refer to birthdates or addresses. An example of a good username would be: 
racer_3391.
A password is a word or string of characters that provides access to the service 
features. Strong passwords are at least eight characters in length and include a com-
bination of text, numbers, and symbols. A combination of both upper and lowercase 
characters makes the password even stronger. A good example is: M3t3_Cr3ss#154! 
It is recommended that you not use the same password for everything because if 
a cyber criminal deciphers your password from one service they can then use that 
same password to access other accounts.
Your credentials are used not only to send and receive e-mails but also for a 
variety of other options. For example, you can use credentials to set up a check-
ing account, place an online order, pay bills, exchange instant messages, and so on. 
Other services that require a unique logon are blogs, social networking sites, and 
video conferencing services.
When you send postal mail to someone, you must know that person’s address. 
The same is true for e-mail. Each user on the Internet must have a unique e-mail 
address. An e-mail address consists of three parts: the user name, the @ symbol, 
and a domain name. A domain name is an address of a computer network con-
nection that identifies the owner of the address. For example, in the e-mail address 
signinname@outlook.com, signinname is the user name, and outlook.com is the 
domain name.
3-3.1.1
Quick Tip
To evaluate whether or not you 
have a strong password, go to 
Microsoft.com and search for the 
keywords “password checker.” 
The password checker automati-
cally tests the strength of your 
password security.

Managing E-Mail with Microsoft Outlook
Microsoft Outlook is an Office application you can use to manage e-mail. It is a ver-
satile application that you can also use to organize contacts, appointments, and tasks. 
Although you will explore only the basic Outlook e-mail features in this lesson, you 
can also get a quick view of some of the other Outlook features.
The Step-by-Steps in this lesson assume that you already have an e-mail account 
set up in Outlook. As you work through the steps, the figures will show folders and 
e-mail messages that are comparable to what you should see on your computer. The 
figures are intended as a guide for you to correlate the information in the steps to the 
folders and e-mail messages that display on your computer.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions for Outlook generally provide directions for using a mouse to access 
commands and features. For example, the instructions may refer to actions such as 
point, click, double-click, or right-click. If you are using a touchscreen, you can use 
gestures such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead of following the directions 
for using the mouse.
Exploring the Outlook Features
An advantage to using Outlook as your e-mail application is that as you work 
with e-mail messages you can manage other types of data. For example, you can 
add contacts to your address book, schedule a meeting on your calendar directly 
from an incoming e-mail message, and add tasks to your to-do list when a mes-
sage requests further action. In the next Step-by-Step you will get a quick peek at 
these features. You can find more information and tutorials about these features at 
Office.com.
Step-by-Step 26.1
	 1.	 Open the Windows Start screen. If necessary, scroll through the Start 
screen tiles, and then click the Outlook 2013 application tile. (If your 
computer is on a network, you might be prompted to enter your profile 
name and a password when starting Outlook. If a dialog box appears ask-
ing you to make Outlook your default program for e-mail, calendar, and 
contacts, click No.) A window similar to the one shown in Figure 26–1

Managing E-Mail Account Folders
Outlook allows you to manage multiple e-mail accounts by organizing the messages 
in standard folders such as Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, and Outbox. You can custom-
ize most Outlook folders to display information in a number of ways. The folders 
can be divided into favorites and general mail folders, or you can create your own 
personal folders for various topics, special projects, and individuals.
Mail management is handled primarily through the Inbox. When you open 
Outlook, it sends a request to your mail server to check if you have any messages 
waiting. Outlook receives incoming messages and displays them in the Inbox folder. 
The list of the messages in the Inbox can be arranged by date with the newest on top 
or the oldest on top.
Archiving is the process of backing up your e-mail messages. Using the default 
settings, Outlook runs the AutoArchive feature every 14 days. Depending on the set-
tings you choose, after a designated period of time Outlook will automatically delete 
old messages or move them to an archive data file. The archive data file will be saved 
with a .pst extension, and you can choose the drive and folder where the archive data 
file is saved.

Outlook can synchronize data 
with other devices such as 
another computer, a cell phone, 
or other mobile devices. When 
messages are sent or received 
on one of the devices, the e-mail 
information is automatically 
updated on the synchronized 
devices. There are several tools 
and apps that enable you to 
synchronize information between 
your computer and other devices.

Creating and Saving an E-Mail Message
Creating an e-mail involves entering the e-mail addresses of the people to whom you 
are sending the message, adding a subject line, and typing the message.
You can send an e-mail message to multiple recipients, and the message goes to 
all the e-mail addresses at the same time. If you are sending an e-mail to more than 
one person, each e-mail address should be separated by a semicolon. You can type 
the e-mail address for the recipients, or you can access the addresses in your contacts 
(sometimes referred to as an address book).
You can send a courtesy copy (Cc) copy of an e-mail to another person. You 
should only copy people who are directly involved. The recipient of the Cc is vis-
ible to all the recipients of the message. It is proper etiquette to use Cc so all the 
recipients know who received a copy. However, when you add addresses to the To 
and Cc text boxes, you are disclosing the e-mail addresses of all those recipients. If 
you don’t want to disclose a recipient’s address, you can send a blind copy (Bcc) to 
that recipient. The recipient of the Bcc is not visible to the primary and Cc recipients, 
so they are not aware that someone else received the message. You can Cc and Bcc 
multiple recipients.
It is good e-mail etiquette to include a subject for your message. The subject 
should be brief, yet descriptive enough to tell the recipient what the message is 
about. Many people scan the subject lines of their messages before opening them, so 
your subject lines should be meaningful and accurate.
The body of the message should be clear, concise, and free from spelling 
errors. You can even format the body of the message to look like a traditional docu-
ment. Outlook and other e-mail programs provide at least two formatting options: 
HTML and Plain Text. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the default for-
mat in Outlook, and it supports text formatting options such as multiple fonts, 
bold text, colored headings, graphics, and links to Web sites. Messages with the 
Plain Text format contain only text. There are no colors, hyperlinks, or graphics. 
Outlook also provides Rich Text Format, which is a Microsoft format supported 
only by Microsoft e-mail applications. Rich Text Format is similar to HTML and 
enables you to apply text formats including fonts, paragraph alignment, bulleted 
lists, and hyperlinks.
Above and Beyond
The Cc in the e-mail window 
is the abbreviation for carbon 
copy, which originated with the 
old-fashioned typewriter. To send 
someone a copy of a letter or to 
create a file copy, a typist used 
a sheet of carbon paper between 
each sheet of paper.
Above and Beyond
To simplify the task of sending 
an e-mail message to multiple 
recipients, you can create a 
Send/Receive group. You can 
add multiple members to the 
group, and then when you enter 
the e-mail address, you enter 
the Send/Receive group name. 
Outlook then sends the message 
to each member in the group.

Attaching a File and Sending a Message
In addition to sending a message, you can include attachments such as pictures or 
documents. More than one file can be attached to the same message, and the files do 
not need to be of the same type. Any attachments should be noted in the body of the 
message. When recipients receive the message, they can open or save the attached 
file. In addition to the e-mail options discussed previously, other alternatives are 
available. The ability to send and receive e-mail attachments, and other supplemental 
information, is of great benefit and is often a timesaver, though it does introduce a 
security risk.
You can add a tag to the message header to alert the recipients about the priority 
of the message. For example, you can add a tag to indicate that the recipients should 
follow up, that the message is high priority, or that the message is low priority.
Regardless of whether the message is formal or informal, incorrect spelling 
and grammar will give you a poor reflection. Although using the default settings, 
Outlook checks spelling as you type, you may have missed some of your errors. 
It is good practice to use the Spelling & Grammar command before you send the 
message. Similar to the spell check feature in Word, you can ignore a flagged issue, 
apply suggested edit, or edit the content yourself. 
Sometimes e-mail messages “bounce back” and are undeliverable. The e-mail 
address is typed incorrectly, a server in the process might not recognize the address, 
or the server is busy and the process is not completed within the specified amount 
of time. The message may also be undeliverable because the recipient has blocked 
messages from the sender, the recipient’s mailbox is full, or the recipient’s security set-
tings reject attachments, or attachments with executable programs (.exe extensions).
Quick Tip
Instead of attaching a file, if the 
e-mail is created in HTML format, 
you can create a hyperlink to the 
file in the e-mail message. With 
this format, the recipient can 
click the link rather than opening 
an attachment. For example, you 
can type a URL in the message 
body, or you can select a word or 
phrase and then create a hyper-
link. The recipient of the message 
must also use a program that can 
display hyperlinks.
Step-by-Step 26.4
	 1.	 If necessary, click the Mail view in the Navigation bar, select the Inbox 
folder for your e-mail account, and select the HOME tab.

is deleted from the Drafts folder and a copy of the message now appears

Receiving and Opening E-Mail Messages
When you receive a message, Outlook automatically saves the message in the Inbox. 
Using default settings, Outlook is scheduled for an automatic send/receive every 
30 minutes. However, you can manually check for new messages in your Inbox at 
any time.
The message list displays information from the message headers for any new 
messages. The information tells you who sent the message, the subject of the message, 
and the date and time your server received it. When the message is selected in the mes-
sage list, the entire message displays in the Reading pane and you can use the scroll 
bars to navigate through the message. If the message contains a significant amount of 
content, you might find it easier to read by opening the message in its own window.
You can organize the message list by date, and you can filter the list so that only 
the unread messages display. To quickly locate a message, you can search for key-
words in messages that display in the message list. You can manually mark a message 
as read or unread. Icons in the message headers in the message list offer clues about 
each message. For example, a red exclamation point icon means the sender considers it 
an urgent or high-priority message; a paper clip icon indicates that the message has an 
attached file. You can also add a flag icon as a reminder to follow up on the message.
You will most likely open most of the messages in your Inbox, but you do not 
need to open or save unwanted messages and spam. Spam is unsolicited e-mail. 
In many instances, spam is used to advertise products and services. Most Internet 
service providers provide tools that filter spam messages to help you avoid these 
annoying and phony messages. Outlook can automatically direct suspicious mes-
sages to the Junk E-mail folder. To avoid receiving these unwanted messages, be 
careful about displaying your e-mail address publicly and do not reply to unwanted 
e-mail messages from questionable sources. You will learn more about controlling 
spam in Lesson 31.

Responding and Replying to a Message
The easiest way to reply to an e-mail message is to use the Reply command, type 
your reply message, and then send the message. With this type of reply, the original 
message is included along with your reply message. When you reply to an e-mail 
message, the recipient normally sees RE: preceding the text in the subject line to 
indicate that it is a reply message.
If more than one person is listed on the From, To, or Cc lines of the e-mail mes-
sage, you can use the Reply All command instead of Reply. Suppose, for example, 
you received an e-mail from a friend and the friend used the Cc text box to send 
a copy of the message to several other people. To reply to only the sender, click 
the Reply button. To reply to the friend and send a copy of the message to the oth-
ers listed in the Cc box, use the Reply All button. Using the Reply or Reply All 
option is appropriate when all the recipients can benefit from and should see your 
response.
Opening E-Mail Attachments
When you receive an attachment to an e-mail message, you can preview the file 
contents in the Reading pane or you can open the attachment file in an application 
such as Word or Adobe Reader. You can also print an attached document or save the 
attachment file to your computer or device. When using default settings, Outlook 
prompts you to enable editing when you open a file attached to an e-mail.

conversation
A conversation, sometimes referred to as the message thread, is the complete 
set of e-mail messages from the original message through all the responses. All mes-
sages in a conversation have the same subject. There are often several replies and 
multiple people involved in a conversation.
The Forward option is similar to replying to a message except that when you 
forward a message, you send it to people other than those who sent the original 
message. Forwarding a message helps cut down on the time you spend creating mes-
sages from scratch. It is also a quick way to share information with a number of 
people. When you forward a message, a recipient normally sees FW: preceding the 
text in the subject line to identify it as a message that is being forwarded.

Setting Rules for Auto-Responding to Messages
You can create an Outlook rule to automatically reply to some or all received e-mail 
messages. You can personalize a message to let senders know that you are not able 
to respond. The message should also provide information about when you expect 
to return to your normal routine for responding to e-mails. In a professional envi-
ronment, you should also provide additional information so the sender can contact 
someone else for assistance with urgent issues.
To set up an auto-response for messages, you must first create a template for 
the message content, and then you must set some rules. In order for the automatic 
reply rule to work, Outlook must be running and configured to check for new e-mails 
periodically.

Creating Appropriate Messages
With the advent of online communication formats, the boundary between profes-
sional and informal messages has blurred. Not only has computer technology pro-
vided the tools to make composing messages easier, we can now compose messages 
faster. The fast-paced media used for electronic communication demands a writing 
style that is clear and concise without sacrificing speed. This often results in infor-
mal messages that include abbreviations and conversational language. As a result, 
sometimes recipients interpret the message differently than the sender intended and 
the information is communicated incorrectly. When writing professional communi-
cations, the language should be more formal and the information should be stated in 
complete sentences that clearly deliver the intended message.
E-mails provide an electronic trail, similar to that of a traditional paper trail. 
A paper trail is a written record, history, or collection of evidence created by a per-
son or organization in the course of activities. E-mails create electronic trails that 
document discussions, contact information, even access to attached files. But keep 
in mind, e-mail messages are not private. An electronic trail can be restored and 
reviewed, and you may be judged on what you say and how you say it. So as you 
write an e-mail message and before you send the message, make sure the content is 
accurate and appropriate.
At one time or another, everyone has sent an e-mail that they wanted to take 
back. For example, maybe you sent the message to the wrong person. Or, if you 
receive an e-mail message that makes you angry, your immediate response may be 
to send a quick reply. This action could accelerate the conflict instead of resolving 
it. To avoid sending a message you later may regret, consider the following 
options:
n 
Before you create the message, discuss the issue with someone else. Let them 
share their opinions and suggestions for how you should respond.
n 
When you begin to create your message, do not include the e-mail address in the 
To line. This will prevent an accidental sending of the message.
n 
Before you click Send, make sure you are sending the message to the right peo-
ple. Proofread everything and confirm that you have no misspelled words or 
grammatical errors.
n 
Save your message overnight as a draft and then reevaluate your response the 
next day.
E-Mail/E-Aches
Although e-mail is a popular service that enables us with quick and convenient communication, it may not 
always save us time. Many users find an overflow of messages in their Inboxes. Similar to telemarketers 
using your phone number, online marketers and other groups can locate your e-mail address and use it to 
send you many unwanted e-mail messages. But it’s not just marketing messages. Co-workers and personal 
friends may forward messages to you that are of no value to you. Receivers are often guilty of not thor-
oughly reading an e-mail message before they reply, or they may use the Reply All option even when all the 
recipients do not need to receive the response. Pay close attention to whom you are sending your messages 
and replies.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Electronic communication is the technology that enables users 
to transmit text, numbers, voice, and video from one computer 
or device to another.
n 
The Internet provides many communication services, such as 
e-mail, instant messaging, and text messaging to billions of 
users around the world.
n 
Even as technology evolves and provides new and enhanced 
methods of electronic communications, e-mail is still widely 
used.
n 
Outlook provides several features that enable you to access cal-
endars, contacts, and tasks as you work with e-mail messages.
n 
Creating an e-mail involves entering the e-mail addresses of 
the recipients, adding a subject line, and typing the message.
n 
E-mail messages are organized in folders. You can use the stan-
dard folders provided in the default settings, or you can create 
your own personal folders to store messages.
n 
In response to an incoming message, you can reply to the 
message, forward the message to a new recipient, delete the 
message, or save the message.
n 
You can automatically add a signature at the end of any outgo-
ing messages.
n 
Special e-mail features enable you to automatically respond 
and forward incoming messages to another address.
n 
When creating e-mail messages, whether for professional or 
informal communications, it is important that the message is 
clear and accurate.

Growing developments in technology are creating new opportunities to quickly and 
easily find and share information and communicate with others from virtually any-
where in the world. The availability to deliver a message to any device or person at 
any time and in any place, changes how we communicate and collaborate with others 
in a profound way.
Defining Time-Shifting and Real-Time 
Communication Methods
Social networking, chat rooms, blogs, message groups, and forums are part of our 
daily sources of interaction. Using collaborative communication tools enables us to 
share information with one other person or an unlimited number of people.
In addition to sharing text messages, you can engage in other types of corre-
spondence including live voice, full-motion video, and interactive desktop sharing. 
A combination of the preceding communication methods may be used, especially for 
group collaboration. For example, a group of people who live in different parts of the 
country may be enrolled in the same online class. This group can use e-mail, instant 
messaging, file sharing, and video chatting to communicate about a class project. 
They could also use a blog to post project updates and social networks to keep in 
touch with each other. (See Figure 27–1.)

Time-Shifting Communications
When you send messages by e-mail, post information on a bulletin board, or publish 
a blog, there might be a significant delay between the transmission and the receipt of 
the information. This type of communication is referred to as time-shifting mode. The 
receiver can choose when they want to review the information.
The primary use of a blog (short for Web log) is for individuals to post a per-
sonal diary or journal on a Web site to share his or her observations and opinions. 
People who respond to the comments in the blogs are notified when the blog is 
updated. Users attach tags, keyword descriptions to identify images or text, to sim-
plify the search process.
Blogs are also used for marketing. Companies use the blogs to provide customer 
feedback and links to several other Web sites.
Like many companies, Microsoft hosts blogs to communicate with customers. 
In the following Step-by-Step exercise, you will visit a Microsoft blog for Windows 
users.

netiquette
real-time communications
Just as etiquette applies when sending e-mail messages, netiquette, a combina-
tion of the words net and etiquette, refers to good manners and proper behaviors 
when communicating through electronic media. Below are some simple netiquette 
rules to follow when blogging:
n	
Write original content and take responsibility for what you write. Do not plagia-
rize someone else’s content or steal their ideas and present them as your own.
n	
Proofread and check your grammar and spelling. The quality of your writing is 
a reflection of your credibility.
n	
Respond to those who write comments on your blog.
n	
If you are quoting others, or sharing their ideas, give them the credit and provide 
links to those sources.
n	
When you write a comment on someone’s blog, use kind and polite words. Say 
something substantial and useful, and avoid negative comments.
Real-Time Communications
Real-time communications occur instantly or without noticeable delay. In other 
words, they are “live” connections. Real-time responses are often understood to be 
in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds, so they make it faster and 
easier for people to connect and to access and share information. There are a variety 
of electronic methods available for real-time communication and collaboration. The 
communication method you use depends on the people with whom you are corre-
sponding and the topic of the correspondence.

Text Messaging
Text messaging, often referred to as texting or Instant messaging (IM), is a text-
based form of communication primarily used for conversational text. It is best 
used when correspondence needs to be accessed in real time. It is especially use-
ful when you want instant feedback and you don’t have time to have a telephone 
­conversation, or if you are in a public environment and you don’t want others to 
hear your conversation.  
Text messages can be sent from a computer, a cell phone, or another mobile 
device. The conversation is initiated when the sender sends a message. The mes-
sage system generally alerts the recipient, and then the recipient can immediately 
read the message without waiting. However, the recipient can choose to read the 
text message at a later time. The recipient can respond to the message, if desired. 
If the recipient’s device is powered off, the message can still be delivered later. 
Another benefit of a text message is that it can be saved on both the sender’s and 
the receiver’s device. See Figure 27–5.

IM technology has been constantly changing. Introduced in 1994, Short 
Messaging Service (SMS) technology initiated the development and growth of text 
messaging. SMS is a service provided by phone, Web, or mobile communication 
systems for text messaging. SMS uses standardized communications protocols to 
allow devices to exchange short text messages up to 160 characters.
ICQ was the first Internet-wide instant messaging service, first developed and 
released by an Israeli company in 1996. ICQ is not an acronym; ICQ is shorthand 
for “I seek you,” referring to finding friends and family for conversation. Instead of 
establishing usernames, ICQ created a unique identification number (UIN) for each 
user. America Online (AOL) acquired ICQ in 1998 and then sold ICQ to Digital Sky 
Technologies in 2010.

AIM (an acronym for AOL Instant Messaging) is a free service that was 
launched by AOL in 1997. With AIM text messaging you can follow your friends, 
post status messages, photos, and even videos to stay connected in real time. AIM is 
available on Windows and Mac computers, mobile phones, and other devices. AIM 
Express, which is also a free download, enables you to send instant messages from a 
Web browser. You can add a variety of accounts to AIM including Facebook, Twitter, 
and YouTube.
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) extends the core capability of SMS 
and enables you to send messages that include multimedia content. MMS is most 
commonly used for communication between mobile phones. With MMS you can 
send pictures, sound effects, emoticons, and audio and video files via your phone.  
MMS does not have a limit on the number of characters, but if a message is longer 
than 160 characters, the message may be delivered in multiple segments.
Apple provides iMessage, a free service for iOS-powered devices such as the 
iPhone and the iPad. Users can send an unlimited number of messages, as well as 
photos, videos, Web links, contacts and location information.
Today there are several free IM software programs available that enable users 
to interact with others using different IM programs. Many of the IM programs, such 
as Windows Live Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger), Yahoo! Messenger, and 
Google Talk offer features such as the ability to play games, share files, listen to 
music, video-chat, and personalize messages with emoticons. IM technology will 
continue to change with new features and capabilities.
Primarily, texting is considered a casual form of communication, but it should still 
be done the proper way. The following are suggested rules for proper use of texting.
n 
Do not use text messaging for formal conversations such as invitations or to 
deliver bad news. Some conversations require face-to-face communication.
n 
Use simple words and sentences to clearly convey your message. Avoid using 
sarcasm and irony because your message may be misinterpreted.
n 
Your message reflects your credibility, so be careful what you say and always 
use correct punctuation and grammar.
n 
Use standard capitalization. Do not use ALL CAPS, which are equivalent to 
shouting, because shouting is not appropriate.
n 
Choose appropriate times to text, such as when you are waiting at the bus stop. 
It is rude to interrupt a face-to-face conversation by reading or sending a text 
message. Limit your texting when you are with a group of people. You should 
be interacting with those who are around you. Texting during working hours 
depends on the opinions of your boss and your work environment.
n 
Do not forward spam messages.
n 
Before you send the message, double check the address to make sure you are 
sending it to the intended recipient(s).
Chatting
Chatting is talking to other people in real-time on the Internet. Most commonly, the 
“talk” is created with typed messages, but a chat can also be conducted using sound 
or sound and video. Chatters exchange their comments in a chat room provided by 
a network or online service such as Gmail Chat or Windows Live Messenger. Chat 
sessions can involve anywhere from just two chatters to hundreds of chatters.
Chats are focused on a selected topic, providing an opportunity for people to 
connect and interact with others who share common interests. The chat discussions 
can be ongoing, or the chat session can be arranged for a specific time and for a 
designated duration. During chat sessions, photos, files, and links can be shared. 
Chatters can enhance their comments by using animated emoticons, color themes, 
buzzes, and other features. See Figure 27–6.

Being polite is important for all conversations, whether they are face-to-face 
or online. To ensure that you have a positive experience, you need to demonstrate 
proper netiquette in a chat room.
n 
Introduce yourself when you enter a chat room. Greet new chatters when they 
enter the room.
n 
Treat people with respect and dignity, the same way you would if you talked to 
them face-to-face.
n 
Stay on topic and use straightforward and concise sentences. Use emoticons to 
show how you feel.
n 
Use appropriate language and show respect in your choice of words. Ignore 
offensive comments.
n 
Do not use ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation points. It looks like you’re 
shouting.
n 
Be patient and allow other chatters time to respond. Do not interrupt other 
chatters.
Audio-Visual Communication
Business and education environments benefit from using audio-visual communica-
tion methods. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is technology that enables the 
delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions using Internet Protocol. 
VoIP is widely used to conduct online meetings and training. The connections can be 
at home, at work, in a corporate network, or during travel.
A podcast is a method of publishing files (primarily audio files) to the Internet 
that can be downloaded for playback on a computer or a mobile device. Podcasts 
provide an effective way for businesses and organizations to deliver content for a 
variety of topics. They provide a convenient way to listen to what you want and 
when you want. For example, you can listen to a podcast during your commute  
to work.

Web conferencing (also referred to as a Webinar) is a presentation, lecture, 
workshop, or seminar that is transmitted over the Web. Presenters are able to deliver 
a presentation over the Web to a group of participants in different geographic 
areas. Web conferencing systems include features such as texting, VoIP, and full-
motion video. Sometimes there is a limit for the number of participants in a session. 
Participants listen to the presenter as the presenter shares applications, or their entire 
desktop. Although participants are not able to interact during the presentation, they 
can usually ask questions and share comments after the presentation in a chat session 
or via an audio transmission. See Figure 27–7.

Video conferencing is using computer networks to transmit audio and video data. 
Video conferencing has become an essential tool in business, education, medicine, 
and media. With a single click, employees can launch a meeting with co-workers, 
customers, or clients. When conducted properly, the electronic ­communication can 
be as effective as a face-to-face meeting, and all those involved don’t even need to 
leave their desks. See Figure 27–8.
In the business environment, interactive whiteboards are commonly used in 
a video conference. An interactive whiteboard is a computer program that allows 
participants in a video conference to interact and make changes to a document. 
Participants can simultaneously enter and edit text and graphics and highlight areas 
in a document.

Cameras, microphones, and speakers are often built into mobile devices and 
enable you to video chat with friends and colleagues. Video chat is where you see the 
person with whom you are talking. Programs such as Gmail chat, iChat, Windows 
Live, and Skype provide video features, enabling you to video chat with anyone 
around the world.
When you participate in video conferences, you should show the same courtesy 
and etiquette that you would show in a professional meeting. Below are some guide-
lines to follow to reflect professionalism and credibility:
n 
Gather pertinent information in advance and be prepared.
n 
Dress appropriately and be properly groomed.
n 
Silence your mobile phone and other devices so that incoming calls and alerts 
do not interrupt the meeting.
n 
Don’t interrupt the conversation. Wait for your turn to speak.
n 
When not speaking, use the mute button to eliminate background noise.
n 
Remain aware of your facial expressions and body language.

The VoIP service Skype enables you to communicate with friends, family, and 
colleagues by voice, video, and instant messaging. You can also share files and your 
desktop screen. Skype is available on computers, mobile devices, TV, and even a 
traditional landline. You can connect with anyone else who is using Skype and cre-
ate a group connection with up to ten people. When you are online, you can enable 
options to let others know you are available. If you don’t want them to know you are 
online, you can enable the invisible option. See Figure 27–9.

The Skype service alerts your Skype contacts when you are online and when 
they are available for communications. If you don’t want people to know you are 
online, there are settings you can enable for invisible status.
Whether you use video chat for personal or business communications, you 
should show the same courtesy and netiquette that you would show in a live face-
to-face meeting. Video chats are often impromptu, so consider the following before 
initiating or accepting a request for a video chat:
n 
Schedule video calls in advance, or ask for approval of a video chat.
n 
Make sure you, and the person you are contacting, are in an appropriate loca-
tion. For example, don’t video chat from a restroom or a busy restaurant.
n 
Consider the differences in time zones; your contacts may be on different time 
schedules.
n 
Use statuses (available, invisible, away, busy, etc.) effectively.
n 
Remain aware of your facial expressions.
n 
Look into the camera, maintain eye contact, and stay motionless.
n 
Be mindful of background noises, which can be annoying.
Social Media Sites
Social media is a term used to describe a variety of Web-based platforms, applica-
tions and technologies that enable people to keep in touch with friends, find people 
with similar interests, and build relationships online. Social media is also a power-
ful marketing tool. Some examples of social media sites and applications include 
Facebook, YouTube, Google+, Twitter, and Instagram. Social networks such as 
LinkedIn also increase networking opportunities.
The information a user shares on a social network may include photos and 
videos, age and gender, interests, contacts, and geographical location. In addition, 
users often provide biographical information such as their level of education, their 
hometown, and their current employer and employment history. Most social net-
works offer privacy settings so users can grant or limit access to their information. 
You can group your friends and other contacts, such as friends, family members, 
or colleagues and then adjust the privacy settings accordingly so that some infor-
mation is visible to some and invisible to others. For example, you can share your 
status updates with everyone, but you can limit access to your personal contact 
information.

Communication Ethics
Ethics is about behavior, not about feelings and opinions. It’s about how we treat each other and how we 
use available resources. The emergence of new electronic communication technology creates new waves of 
ethical issues, adding emphasis to the need to follow ethical guidelines.
The choices made when using electronic communications reflect values and have consequences. In 
order to prevent harm to others, which is the basis for any type of ethics, computer developers and users 
must recognize and responsibly address ethical issues.

Lesson 27  Communications and Collaboration	
Mod3-71
You can change your online status by sharing information about who you are 
with, where you are, and so on. When enabled, location apps show your location 
when you post information. Make sure you only authorize trusted apps (such as 
games and online polls and quizzes) and Web sites. If you enable options for third 
parties, they can also gain access to your private information. Also, apps will post to 
your account, sometimes even if you don’t want them to. For example, news outlets 
will show the articles you have read.
Posting comments on a social network site is like speaking to a crowd of people 
at a huge gathering. The difference is that comments on a social network site stay 
with you forever. Therefore, when using social media sites it is important to use 
proper netiquette, as listed below.
n 
Think before you post and use common sense. If you wouldn’t say it in public, 
then don’t say it online.
n 
Consider whether you will offend someone when you post the content.
n 
Use appropriate language. Be polite and consider the tone.
n 
Don’t post inappropriate, unflattering, or embarrassing pictures and videos.
n 
Don’t over share.
n 
Be accountable for your actions.
n 
Keep private matters in private messages.
n 
Use statuses (available, invisible, away, busy, etc.) effectively.
n 
Give credit where credit is due. When you pass something on or repost the con-
tent through social media, include the source.
Identifying the Advantages and 
Disadvantages of Collaborative Electronic 
Communication
Electronic communication offers many advantages over other types of communi-
cation. Electronic communications enable people to connect worldwide. The com-
munication is convenient and it is not restricted to a specific place and time. Access 
is available from not only computers but also mobile devices, which allow users 
to communicate from remote locations and transmit text, graphics, audio files, and 
video files. Online document sharing allows users to create and edit documents 
online while collaborating in real time with other users. The Cloud is an example of 
online document sharing.
You can use more than one type of correspondence, including one-to-one, one-to-
many, and many-to-many. In one-to-one communication, one sender communicates 
with one receiver. E-mail is an example of one-to-one communication. One-to-many 
communication involves a sender communicating with many receivers. An e-mail 
message sent from one person to a group is an example of one-to-many communi-
cation. Many-to-many communications, such as blogs, chat rooms, and social net-
works, enable multiple people to communicate simultaneously.
Electronic communication fosters community building by connecting members 
of a group who share the same general interest. The community could be connected 
by a social media site, blog, mailing list, message board, or other type of electronic 
communication, which allows them to exchange information and organize their 
efforts to meet a goal.

Module 3  Living Online
Depending on the type of communication, costs can be minimal or even free 
in some instances. E-mail, for example, is a service that is part of most networked 
computers. Price remains the same whether you send and receive a hundred e-mail 
messages or a thousand e-mail messages. Based on the device that is being used, 
instant messaging is a free service or has a minimal fee. On the other hand, busi-
ness video conferencing generally involves a fee for the host. However, using this 
service can eliminate travel expenses for people who would otherwise need to meet 
in person.
There are also some disadvantages to using electronic communication. After 
sending a message, you may not be aware that there is misconception of your cor-
respondence. When you meet with people face-to-face, you can read their body lan-
guage and watch their facial expressions as they react to your message.
There are security risks when you use electronic communications. Users may 
misuse and abuse shared computing resources. Furthermore, your computer can be 
hacked and your confidential and sensitive information can be stolen. Also, your 
computer can be affected with a computer virus, which can corrupt data.
Consider the consequences. Be aware that electronic communications can 
leave an “electronic trail.” Messages left on public sites such as blogs, message 
boards, or posts to social networking sites can be publicly and even permanently 
accessible.
Staying in touch with friends, family, and colleagues, and using time efficiently 
is valuable, but excessive use of online communications can cause problems. It is 
important that individuals also connect with people in a physical presence. The 
lack of personal interaction can damage relationships and even reduce overall 
productivity.
Creating Effective Communications
Collaboration and communication are at the center of today's enterprise, but unlock-
ing maximum results requires more than simply deploying the right technology 
tools. To be effective in communication, you must understand and respond to the 
needs of the recipient.
Select a communication method that suits the purpose of the message and the 
audience. Keep in mind that even though you can conduct verbal, written, and face-
to-face communications using a variety of electronic communication methods, meet-
ing with a person physically or making a phone call to discuss a topic might be the 
most beneficial means of communication. Likewise, sending a handwritten note is 
more sentimental and adds a personal touch.
The level of formality and informality is based on the people with whom you are 
corresponding and the topic of the correspondence. The content, tone, and format of 
the message should be appropriate for its audience. The purpose should be clearly 
stated, and the content should be sensible. It’s not only what you say, but also how 
you say it. Regardless of whether the message is formal or informal, the message 
should not contain spelling or other errors.
When conducting business and professional communications, such as schedul-
ing a meeting or responding to an inquiry, the message should be clearly stated with 
a formal tone. Business messages should be about the reader and not the writer. 
The “U” comes before the “I” in business. When composing a business message, 
assume that the reader has limited time and most likely will skim the contents to 
find the main idea. However, do not use abbreviations. Even though abbreviations 
may save you time as you compose the message, they will not save the reader time, 
and the correspondence will lose its credibility.

Lesson 27  Communications and Collaboration	
Mod3-73
Personal and social messages, such as a note to a friend, can be either formal 
or informal with a relaxed tone. Avoid using sarcasm or too much humor unless the 
message is to someone you know very well. Adding elements such as emoticons, 
abbreviations, jokes, and other informal elements are appropriate for some audi-
ences, but not all.
Respond to messages promptly. The type of message often dictates response 
time. For example, if a customer needs immediate assistance or has a com-
plaint, you should reply within 30 minutes to 2–3 hours. If a student needs assis-
tance on how to upload an assignment for his online class, the response time 
should be within 5–10 hours. Other nonemergency responses should be made 
within 24 hours.
Following Electronic Communication 
Standards
Although freedom of speech is an important right, you must still be cautious about 
what you say in electronic communications. Do not make derogatory remarks. 
Statements and information you publish for both private and public review can harm 
people in many ways.
Flaming (bashing) is an intense, online verbal argument. The hostile and ver-
bal interaction involves angry, mean, and vulgar language. Cyberbullying is using 
Internet technology to intentionally harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another 
person. Flaming and cyberbullying can have a negative emotional effect on victims, 
ranging from hurt feelings to intense anger and even depression.
Also, do not post false statements. Slander (an oral communication) and 
libel (a written communication) are untrue statements that can damage a person’s 
or a company’s reputation or character. Posting untrue or threatening informa-
tion can have serious consequences for the individual who makes the statement. 
Defamatory statements and threats are unlawful communications, and the person 
who makes these statements can be sued for damages or may even be sentenced 
with jail time.
Most companies, educational institutions, government agencies, and other busi-
nesses and groups have guidelines for the use of electronic communications within 
the organization. In order to function well, and for their welfare, organizations 
depend on these rules of conduct. Review and apply the rules of netiquette, school 
policies, cultural issues, and other guidelines. For business communications, certain 
rules of etiquette and formality should be applied similar to those used in other busi-
ness communications. The following is a list of general guidelines for using all types 
of electronic communications.
n 
Make sure you are using the appropriate medium for conveying the message.
n 
Clearly convey your message. Use proper grammar and spelling.
n 
Respect the privacy of others and honor confidentiality. Refrain from communi-
cating sensitive information.
n 
Understand the sensitive nature of data and of the rules related to sending data 
electronically.
n 
Back up and archive correspondence on a regular basis.
n 
Cite sources for intellectual property, and give credit to others when sharing 
their ideas.
n 
Avoid harm to others.
n 
Do not send unsolicited bulk messages (spamming).

Module 3  Living Online
Each day millions of people use the Internet and the World Wide Web at work, at 
home, and while traveling. Anyone with access to the Internet can connect to and 
communicate with other Internet users anywhere in the world.
Defining the Internet and the Web
Many people use the terms Internet and Web interchangeably. In reality, they are not 
the same. The Internet can exist without the Web, but the Web cannot exist without 
the Internet. The Internet (often referred to as the Net) is a huge global interconnec-
tion of computer networks around the world. The World Wide Web (often referred to 
as the Web and abbreviated as WWW or W3) is a global collection of interconnected 
documents (Web pages) and other resources.
A Web site is a Web page or a collection of related Web pages located on the 
Web. The pages within the Web site can contain text, images, and multimedia ele-
ments such as audio, video, and animation. Hyperlinks (often referred to as links) 
are an essential part of the Web, because they automatically connect you to another 
part of the same Web page or to another Web page. A Web page link can be a word, 
a phrase, or a graphic.
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language used to 
create Web pages. HTML defines the format and layout of a Web document. Just 
as most filenames include an extension to identify that file type (such as .docx for 
a Word document or .jpg for a graphical file), the Web page file often includes a 
file extension to indicate the file type. For example, the extension may be .html 
or .shtml. SHTML is an HTML file that includes special commands for the server 
to process.
The Web pages are transferred between computers via HyperText Transfer 
Protocol (HTTP), which is the underlying protocol for the Web. This protocol 
defines how messages are formatted across the Internet. An HTTP client program 
is required at one end, and an HTTP server program is required on the other end. 
(Recall that a client is a type of computer program that makes a service request from 
a server.)
Each Web site possesses at least one Internet Protocol (IP) address. The Uniform 
Resource Locator (URL) (often referred to as a Web address) identifies the unique 
IP address. URL addresses are presented in alphanumeric form because it describes 
the resource and makes it easier to remember (such as http://www.cengage.com). 
However, the actual URL is a set of four numbers separated by periods (such as 
212.987.12.3), and the Domain Name System (DNS) translates the alphanumerical 
address to a numeric address.
A domain is a group of computers and devices on a network that are adminis-
tered as a unit with common rules and procedures. All devices sharing a common 
part of the IP address are said to be in the same domain. The domain name provides 
an online identity (such as an organization or company name). If your Web site has a 
lot of information to organize, you can create a subdomain, which is a domain that is 
part of a larger domain and is dependent on the larger domain. A subdomain is like a 
folder under your root directory.
Every Web site domain name also ends with a two- or three-letter extension 
which identifies the type of domain or the country of origin. There are various 
domain types, and each type has its own basic rules such as the type of characters 
and the minimum and maximum number of characters. Some of the most common 
domain types and are described in Table 28–1.

Domain types and extensions are also assigned to a specific country. For 
­example, England is .uk, Canada is .ca, Japan is .jp, and Spain is .es. Accredited 
registrars manage the registrations of domain names.
Once the domain name is registered, a Web hosting service makes the Web site 
accessible via the WWW.
A URL always includes a protocol, the domain name, and the domain type or 
a country code. As shown in Figure 28–1, after the single forward slash /, the URL 
may also include a resource ID which provides the name of the file and any directo-
ries or subdirectories under which the file is stored on the specified computer. The 
domain name is the most easily recognized part of the URL.

A Web browser is a software application you use to view and retrieve documents 
from the Web and to display the documents in a readable format. Browser software 
(such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox) 
sends a message to a Web server to retrieve a requested Web page. For example, 
when you enter a URL in your browser, you send an HTTP command to the Web 
server to tell it to locate and transmit the requested Web page. The browser then 
extracts the HTML code to display the page.

Connecting to the Internet
In homes, the common methods of Internet access include dial-up, broadband, satel-
lite, 3G/4G technology for cell phones, and Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi uses radio waves to provide 
wireless high-speed Internet and network connections. When you are away from 
the office or home, you can use Wi-Fi hotspots to connect to the Internet. A hotspot 
provides Wi-Fi network access (usually Internet access) to a small area for wireless-

Before you can access the Internet, you must connect to it. An Internet ­service 
­provider (ISP) is an organization or company that provides connectivity to the 
Internet through a telecommunications line or wireless system. Its service is 
­primarily to provide a connection to the Internet.
Different types of Internet connections provide a range of options. Be prepared 
to balance the features you want, such as connection speed and reliability, with 
the cost and availability of the options. For example, a dial-up connection is the 
least expensive type of Internet connection, but it is also the slowest. Broadband 
connections such as cable modems and digital subscriber lines (DSL) offer a high 
bandwidth, which refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted. Broadband 
connections can transmit multiple channels of information over a single link, so they 
can carry video, voice, and computer data simultaneously and at a much faster speed.
After you contract an ISP, you must install some type of telecommunications 
software. This software enables your computer to connect to another computer. Your 
ISP or online service company provides this software, or most likely you will be able 
to use software already installed on your computer. Most new computers are set up 
for a wireless connection.
When you connect to the Internet, you will need a Web browser to display  
Web pages. Most computers purchased today come with a browser already installed. 
For example, Internet Explorer 11 is installed with Windows 8.1. Other popular  
Web browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome.
With the telecommunications software and a browser installed, you are ready 
to connect to the Internet. If you are using a dial-up modem, you may have to give 
instructions to your computer to dial a local telephone number, but if you have a 
high-speed dedicated phone line, a cable connection, or a wireless service, you just 
start your browser. This connects you to your ISP’s computer, which in turn connects 
you to the Internet. You are then online with the world.
Access to the hotspot services may be free to all, free to customers only, or 
fee-based. You may need a password to complete the connection. A hotspot can be 
limited to a confined location, such as a restaurant, or it can be more widespread and 
cover a large area such as a school campus.
The exercises in this lesson assume that you have an Internet connection, such 
as a broadband or wireless connection.
Touchscreen Users
The instructions in this lesson generally provide directions for using a mouse to 
access commands and features. For example, the instructions may refer to actions 
such as point, click, double-click, or right-click. If you are using a touch screen, you 
can use gestures such as press, tap, slide, swipe, and drag instead of following the 
directions for using the mouse.

Downloading and Uploading Data
Many ISPs, especially for mobile devices, include a monthly data usage allowance, 
and if you exceed the limit for your plan, you may pay an extra fee. Therefore, it is 
important that you understand how data usage occurs and how it is calculated.
Almost every time you access the Internet, you will download (receive) or 
upload (send) data. When you browse the Internet, visit a Web site, send text mes-
sages and e-mail messages, and post pictures on social networks, you are using data. 
Streaming is a technique for transferring data in a steady and continuous stream so 
you can start displaying the data before the transmission is completed. For example, 
you can start watching an online video before the entire file has been transmitted. 
Even though the video file may not be stored on your computer, the data is still 
downloaded in some form.

The data is transmitted in packets, and the size of the packet is defined with the 
following terms:
n 
bits—the smallest possible unit of information
n 
kilobit—1,000 bits
n 
bytes—8 bits
n 
kilobyte—8 kilobits
n 
megabit—1,000 kilobits
n 
megabytes—8 megabits
Bytes are capitalized when used in acronyms to distinguish them from bits, 
since both start with the letter B. For example, Kb is kilobits and KB is kilobytes. 
Mb is megabits and MB is megabytes. So, how big are the files typically accessed on 
the Internet? The following is a list of commonly accessed files and a typical size for 
each. Of course, file sizes vary depending on the amount of content, the format, the 
resolution, and the level of quality.

Internet connection speeds are usually measured in seconds. Kbps (kilobits per 
second) usually refers to dial-up and low-speed DSL connections. Mbps (mega-
bits per second) is the most common unit of speed used. Generally, ISP services 
offer different download and upload speeds. For example, a service plan may offer 
a download speed up to 30 Mbps and an upload speed of 4 Mbps. There are differ-
ences in download and upload speeds because most Internet connections are asym-
metric, which means the bandwidth capacity for downloading data is different than 
the capacity for uploading data. For personal use, the average user downloads much 
more than they upload, so the differences in speeds are acceptable. However, busi-
nesses often upload significant amounts of data, so they often subscribe to a higher-
level service that provides faster uploading speeds.
Even if you have a high-speed Internet connection, there are times when the 
transmission of data is very slow. There are several factors that reduce the speed of 
your Internet connection.
n 
As mentioned earlier, the connection type is a major factor.
n 
At peak times, popular Web sites can become overwhelmed with users. As more 
data is requested and sent, more bandwidth is being used at the same time. 
Likewise, home networks are often slow when multiple users are connected to 
the Internet, using multiple browsers. Network administrators for corporate net-
works monitor Internet use and try to keep employees from downloading large 
files during peak hours.
n 
Wireless Internet connections can be slowed down because of devices interfer-
ing with the wireless signal. Household appliances such as microwaves, cable 
TV wires, or a neighbor’s wireless network can interfere with your network 
signal.
n 
Internet speeds can also be slowed down because of outdated equipment, or 
equipment that is not configured properly for optimal performance.

Troubleshooting Internet Connections
Similar to other electronic technologies, Internet connections are not without prob-
lems. Losing your Internet connection can be frustrating, especially if you are in 
the middle of an online conference or uploading important data for others to use. 
Depending on the problem, you may need to contact your ISP. However, you may 
be able to repair the problem with the Internet Connections troubleshooter. Windows 
provides troubleshooting tools to help you identify and resolve problems with your 
Internet connection.

Categorizing Web Sites
There is a vast amount of information available on the World Wide Web. Web sites can 
be organized into categories, each with a different purpose and type of information. 
The following list provides an overview of some of the types of Web sites available.
n 
Commercial—Also known as an e-commerce site, a commercial site sells or 
promotes products or services. Almost every business today has a commercial 
Web site. Many of these Web sites also provide options to purchase products or 
services online.
n 
Academic—Most educational facilities, elementary to university level and pub-
lic to private, have a Web site. Most higher education Web sites provide online 
registration, online courses, and other options. Many research facilities and both 
private and public companies also provide online training for its employees.
n 
Organizational—Examples include Web sites of nonprofit organizations such as 
zoos and advocacy groups such as wildlife and clean air supporters.
n 
Governmental—Most local, state, regional, and national governments have 
numerous Web sites. For instance, a medium-sized city could have a number of 
Web sites for employment, news of the day, parks and recreation, local services, 
utilities, visitor’s guide, customer service, and other public announcement sites.
n 
International—Internet marketing of a product or service sometimes requires 
that Web sites be hosted in other countries. Each country has unique search 
engines, which use different mathematical algorithms. Web page text also needs 
to be translated into the language of the country. Values and customs vary, so an 
effective Web site in one country may not work in other countries. Finally, local 
agencies most likely have a better understanding of the population and search 
engine optimization related to that population.
n 
Search sites—A search engine is a software program used for online ­searching. 
Hundreds of search engines have been developed to find information on the 
Internet. Each search engine may work a little differently, but most share some 
common search features. For example, all search engines support keyword 
searches. More information about using search engines is covered in Lesson 29.
n 
Membership sites—Some Web sites, such as those used for e-mail services and 
e-commerce, require you to register before access to the Web site is allowed. 
Then to access restricted content or use the services, you must enter a user ID 
and a password. When you see the letter “s” after “http” in the URL, it confirms 
that it is a secure Web site. You should always verify that the Web address begins 
with https:// before you enter personal information.
n 
Online applications—Also known as Web apps, these online applications host 
programs you can access with your Web browser. When using a Web app, 
the browser functions as a client. You interact with the software through your 
browser. Some applications allow you to store data on your local computer 
while others store your data and information on its servers. The Cloud is a good 
example. You can create documents online, edit the documents from anywhere, 
and share your documents in real time for no charge.
n 
Portal—A portal is a Web site that features useful content, but it also con-
tains links to other sites. You can use a portal as your home page. For example, 
MSN.com is a portal that includes links to Web sites for news, sports, entertain-
ment, the Bing search engine, etc.
n 
Geographic imaging—Mapping and geographic imaging Web sites use technol-
ogy to change the imagery of the Earth’s surface into valuable information. This 
information is used by geographical information systems (GIS) to capture, store, 
analyze, and manage images. Google Earth is one example of this type of Web site.
n 
Wiki—A wiki is a collaborative Web site that people can use to add, edit, 
remove, and organize Web page content. Wikipedia is a popular online wiki.
3-1.1.1
Above and Beyond
Wikipedia is managed by the 
Wikimedia Foundation, a non-
profit organization that sponsors 
several other wikis, including

Navigating the Web
It is important to know how to navigate Web sites so that you can access the 
­information you are seeking both easily and quickly.
The Web is the graphical portion of the Internet. The browser functions as an inter-
face between you and the Internet. To connect to the Internet, the browser sends a mes-
sage to the Web server to retrieve your requested Web page. The browser then renders 
the HTML code to display the page. Using a browser, you can display both text and 
images. Browsers also support multimedia information, including audio and video.
Your browser was installed with a default home page. A home page is the first 
page that appears in the browser when you visit a Web site, and it is your opening 
to the WWW. Because you are familiar with the content and the links on the home 
page, it can save you time as you begin to navigate Web sites.
Once you open your browser, you can navigate to various Web sites using your 
browser tools as well as navigation menus and hyperlinks provided on the Web 
pages. It is easy to identify text hyperlinks because the text is often underlined and 
formatted in a different color font. Graphics are also used as hyperlinks, and you can 
easily identify those hyperlinks because when you hover the mouse over the graphic 
the mouse pointer changes and displays a hand.
Tabs enable you to open multiple Web sites. In Internet Explorer 11, you can open 
up to 100 tabs in one browsing session. Cache memory is high-speed RAM (random 
access memory) that serves as a temporary storage area for data and it is continually 
updated. When you visit a Web site, a copy of the contents of the Web site is stored in 
your cache. Instead of downloading the data again, your browser reuses the stored data, 
which provides a faster loading time and does not increase your data usage.
When you open a Web site in an InPrivate browser tab, the data about your 
browsing session is not stored in the cache. For example, cookies, temporary Internet 
files, history, and other data, are not saved. Also, by default, toolbars and extensions 
are disabled.
This lesson uses Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 as the browser. The basic ele-
ments exist in all browsers, and most browsers use universal symbols. Table 28–2 
defines some of the buttons in the browser window.

window pane. Those tabs are 
part of the Web page and they 
are not the same as the Web 
browser tabs.

Customizing Web Browser Settings
To go straight to the site you visit the most, you can reset the home page to a Web site 
of your choice. Because you are familiar with the content and the links on the home 
page, it can save you time as you begin to navigate Web sites. You can change your 
home page at any time.
When you are navigating a Web site with multiple pages, instead of clicking the 
Next button to advance to the next portion of the Web page, you can switch to read-
ing view and flip through the Web page content without any advertisements, like you 
are reading a book. You can customize the background style and the font style and 
size in the reading view settings.
The reading view option is only available in the Windows 8.1 user interface, 
and it is turned on by default. The reading view feature is not supported in Internet 
Explorer 11 on Windows 7 or Internet Explorer for the desktop on Windows 8.1.
If you access a Web page that provides information that is regularly updated, 
such as sport scores, most likely you will need to refresh or reload the information.

Managing Plug-Ins
Browser plug-ins (also referred to as add-ons) are optional software apps that add 
functionality to a Web browser. The plug-ins enable you to watch movies, listen to 
music, play online games, open and read documents, and so forth. Common exam-
ples of plug-ins include Adobe Acrobat Reader, Java Virtual Machine, Adobe Flash 
Player, Apple QuickTime, and Windows Media Player.
If you’re unable to play a video, you should check to make sure the plug-in is 
installed and enabled. You can view the plug-ins that are installed. You can also dis-
able any of the plug-ins installed. To remove a plug-in completely, you must unin-
stall the software. If you need a new plug-in, you can search the Web for the plug-in 
and install it.
To manage add-ons, you need to open Internet Explorer in Desktop mode.

Managing Browsing History
Your browser tracks the sites you have visited for a specified period of time. Browsing 
history includes URLs for the Web sites you’ve visited and cached text of pages 
you’ve accessed. It also includes passwords and information that you’ve entered into 
online forms. Browsing history saves you time when you want to revisit a Web site 
because you don’t have to enter the URL or search for the Web site. However, if you 
share a computer, you may want to erase your browsing history. The default setting 
in Internet Explorer is to keep the browsing history for 20 days, but you can manu-
ally delete the history at any time.

Organizing Favorites and Refreshing 
Web Sites
Internet Explorer and other browsers provide a tool that makes it easy for you to 
return to a particular Web site or to easily access a Web site that you visit frequently. 
Internet Explorer refers to these links as favorites. Other browsers refer to these as 
bookmarks.
When you add a Web site as a favorite or bookmarked site to the Favorites bar, 
you can create a new folder to organize favorites. You can save the Web site URL in 
multiple folders. You can organize the favorites in alphabetical order using features 
in the Desktop.
Some Web sites provide information that is regularly updated, such as weather 
forecasts, news updates, and sport scores. When you leave the Web site open 
for a period of time, you will want to refresh (reload) the Web site to update the 
information.
If you don’t have time to explore and read the information on a Web site, you 
can add the URL to a reading list so you can return to the Web site later.

Addressing Web Site Issues
The Internet and browsers are not without their problems. Web sites might not be 
displayed for a number of reasons.
When you enter a Web site address and receive a “Page not found” message, 
the Web site might display a “404 error,” which you receive because a) the page was 
moved, b) an old index is still maintained in a search engine, or c) you made a typing 
error when entering the Web site address. In some instances, the Web site is tempo-
rarily unavailable because the server is offline or the site is being updated.
A Web page may load slowly because of heavy server traffic or because the page 
may contain a large number of images. A garbled or offset page could result from 
a number of issues, such as the rendering technique used by the browser. If you are 
using a recent browser, such as Internet Explorer 11, you can use the Compatibility 
View command to try to display the Web page using older settings.
Pop-up ads can also be an annoyance. Advertisers place these ads on Web sites 
and they pop up in the middle of a page to call attention to its content. Internet 
Explorer contains a pop-up blocker that limits most pop-ups. By default, the pop-up 
blocker is enabled. You can customize the settings to allow pop-ups from specific 
Web sites.
Internet security is essential. Each time you connect to the Internet, there 
is the risk of unauthorized parties accessing sensitive resources. And, you are  
vulnerable to viruses and other malicious code. If a wireless connection is not  
protected by a password, anyone with a wireless router and within the range of 
the signal can use the connection to browse the Internet. However, you might be 
sharing much more than the Internet access. Once they access your wireless con-
nection, they can also access your data. Encryption methods used by routers protect 
against unauthorized access. Older devices might be programmed to connect using  
WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy Protocol), but newer devices are likely pro-
grammed to use WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA-2, which are improved 
encryption methods.
Other forms of security management are gateways and firewalls. A gateway is a 
computer or dedicated hardware device that connects a LAN (Local Area Network) to 
another network, typically the Internet, or a WAN (Wide Area Network). A firewall 
blocks unauthorized network access either within its own LAN or to and from the 
WAN. Network administrators and information security experts configure the fire-
wall to ensure that only authorized protocols, applications, users, etc. are allowed 
access to critical data within the network. Antivirus apps help protect against viruses, 
and antimalware apps help protect against malware. All of these functions need to 
work together for optimal performance and security.
Some antivirus software programs include firewall protection. You need only 
one firewall app running on your PC. Windows Firewall comes with Windows, and 
it is turned on by default. You should not turn Windows Firewall off unless you have 
another firewall turned on.
To customize the settings for compatibility viewing, blocking pop-ups, and turn-
ing on the firewall, you must switch to Desktop mode.

Digital Literacy
To succeed in today’s workplace, you need digital literacy—the ability to find, organize, understand, and 
analyze information using digital technology, including computing devices and the Internet. If you have 
digital literacy, you can communicate, collaborate, and work effectively using online tools.
Many jobs require that you have at least a basic knowledge of computers and the Internet; whereas, 
some careers demand more advanced knowledge or mastery. Digitally literate employees are proficient at 
using a variety of computing devices including portable devices, conducting and analyzing online searches, 
and using online collaboration tools.

Module 3  Living Online
As the use of the World Wide Web continues to grow, it is important to understand 
how to find information effectively. But the task doesn’t end there. Once you find the 
information you want, it is important to know how to evaluate the credibility of 
the information and observe intellectual property laws.
Searching for Information on the Web
The Internet is a valuable source for acquiring knowledge and solving problems. 
As the Internet continues to expand, finding accurate and reliable Web sites, infor-
mation, and answers to questions depends on using resourceful search tools effec-
tively. Two primary tools are available for online searches—a search engine and  
a Web directory.
A search engine is a program that searches documents for specified keywords 
and then provides a list of the sources where the keywords were found. Without 
search engines, you would need to know the specific URL to find information on the 
Web. There are a number of search providers available, such as Bing, Google, and 
Yahoo!. No single tool indexes or organizes the entire Web. When using an online 
search tool, you are not really searching the Web; you are actually searching and 
viewing a database in a search engine.
Internet Explorer provides the Bing.com search engine. But if you don’t find 
what you’re looking for, you can choose from several other search engines.
Even though they work differently, all Web search engines use Webcrawlers 
(also called spiders), which are automated software applications that use an algo-
rithm to search Web sites for relevant information. The Webcrawler reads the page 
titles, textual content, and the meta tags for a Web site. A meta tag is an HTML cod-
ing statement that describes some aspect of the Web page content. The Webcrawler 
also follows the Web site links. When relevant information is found, the URL data is 
then transmitted to a central depository and indexed in the search engine’s database, 
so the URL will show as a search result. Not all search engines use the same algo-
rithm. As a result, not all search engine databases are the same, which explains why 
you often see different results when you use different search engines.
A metasearch engine sends queries to several other search engines. Dogpile and 
Kayak are examples of popular metasearch providers that enable users to enter search 
criteria once and access multiple search engines simultaneously. The ­metasearch 
engine combines the results received from all the search engines. The benefits of 
using a metasearch engine are that you can search multiple search engine databases 
at the same time and see a broader range of results. However, the results are not 
always better because the metasearch engine must use its own algorithm to choose 
the best results.
A Web directory (also referred to as a search directory) is a collection of 
Web sites organized by category, and then they are often further organized by 
geographic region. The purpose of the Web directory is the same as the search 
engine—to locate specific information. The difference is that a Web directory 
index is created by humans, not software. Examples of Web directories include 
Yahoo! Directory (dir.yahoo.com), Open Directory Project (dmoz.org), and Bing 
Directory (bingbusinessdirectory.com).
The Web site owner can directly submit the URL to be added to a Web direc-
tory, or the directory editors can explore the Web, review the Web site, and sub-
mit the URL. Only information approved by the directory editors is indexed in the 
Web directory database. There is sometimes a fee for submitting a URL to a search 
directory, but it can be a cost-effective way to enhance the visibility of the Web site. 
The advantage of a Web directory is its ability to organize data.
Many search engines and directories contain both a computer-generated index 
and a human-generated index, and they are referred to as hybrids. If you are look-
ing for comprehensive results, a search engine is your better choice. If you want a 
selected guide with limited results, a Web directory may be the more useful tool.

Lesson 29  Web Content	
Mod3-117
Searching for Keywords
To answer questions and solve problems, you use a search engine to search for 
keywords, words that describe the information the user is trying to locate. The key-
words enable you to get specific information from dependable sources. By default, 
most search engines perform a Match Any search. The list of results will first display 
pages that contain all your keywords, then the list will show results for pages that 
contain some of your keywords.
Some search engines provide an additional enhancement called concept-based 
searching. The search engine displays results that relate to documents containing 
related concepts, not just the keywords. For example, if you search for “recycling 
electronics,” the search engine might also return hits on sites that contain “e-waste.”
Another feature supported by most search engines is stemming. When you 
search for a word, the search engine also searches for the root forms of the keywords, 
so the search results include additional variations of the keywords. For example, 
when you enter the search word “player,” you may also get back results for “play,” 
“playing,” and “plays.”
Another feature provided by several search engines is a related search. These 
are preprogrammed queries or questions suggested by the search engine that often 
lead to other Web pages containing similar information. A related search can improve 
your odds of finding the information you are seeking. Several search providers offer 
this feature, although they may use different terminology. Look for terms such as 
“similar pages,” “related pages,” or “more pages like this.” Many search providers 
list related search terms at the bottom of the search results.
If you don’t find what you’re looking for, you can use a different search provider. 
There are many search engines available, and most of them are free downloads.

Quick Tip
It is always a good idea to 
capitalize proper nouns because 
some search engines distinguish 
between upper- and lowercase 
letters. On the other hand, if you 
capitalize a common noun such as 
“Bread,” you will find fewer Web 
pages than if you enter “bread.”

button (or press Enter) to display the search results. Note that the list of 
results includes all Web pages that contain any of the three keywords. 
Note the number of Web pages found. See Figure 29–1. The number of 
your results will most likely differ.

for sponsors of the search engine.) The list includes results for concepts 
related to “mountain bike race” such as trail maps, directions, blogs, 
reviews, etc. Sometimes a date is also included in the description which 
displays when the page was either posted or last updated.

search engines differ, there are several tools you can use to make your keywords 
more effective. Using phrases, Boolean operators, or math symbols will generally 
help you control and refine a search so that it does not generate irrelevant results.
If you want to search for words that appear next to each other, you can enter the 
phrase within quotation marks. The search engine matches those words that appear 
adjacent to each other and in the order you specify. If you are searching for more than 
one phrase, you can separate phrases or proper names with a comma. For ­example, 
to find Mickey Mantle baseball cards, enter “baseball cards”,“Mickey Mantle.”
To make keywords more specific and narrow your search results, you can use 
Boolean logic. A Boolean logic search uses three primary logical operators AND, 
OR, and NOT to define the search. When using these operators, type all the letters 
in uppercase. The AND operator makes sure that all the terms in a search appear in 
the Web page. This is a Match All search, rather than a Match Any search. The more 
terms you combine with AND, the narrower the results. The NOT operator restricts 
the search by excluding pages that contain the term. You can use the OR operator to 
search for synonyms or similar concepts. In contrast to the AND and NOT operators, 
the OR operator creates more results.
Sometimes search engines support the math equivalents of the operators. For 
example, instead of using the operator AND, you can insert a plus symbol (+) before 
a term that you want to appear on the page. To subtract terms you do not want, insert 
the minus symbol (-) before each term. Insert the [|] symbol to search for synonyms.

Boolean logic search
Above and Beyond
Boolean logic is named after 
its inventor, George Boole, an 
English mathematician who 
wrote about a system of logic in 
the nineteenth century. Because 
Boolean logic provides the 
foundation of modern computer 
logic, Boole is now considered a 
founder of computer science.

Mod3-119
When you are searching the Web, it is important to notice the date of when the 
information was posted. Some search engines provide options for specific time periods, 
and you may be able to use a date tool in the search query to filter the search by date.
Some search providers assist you with your search through the use of forms. 
Using this form, you can add words and phrases to include and/or exclude. Advanced 
search forms also often provide options to create a logical search or specify a 
time period, region, or language. To access the form, look for a hyperlink such as 
“Advanced Search” or “Advanced Options” on the search engine’s main page.

Searching for Specific Types of Media or Disciplines
You can further refine your search by entering criteria for different types of media, 
such as videos, or by identifying a specific file type, such as a .png.
You can search for different types of media by searching related databases. For 
example, you can search youtube.com for videos, you can search itunes.com for 
music, and you can search flickr.com for photos. Web sites like these often organize 
information by category, which makes the search go faster.
Because large Web sites contain many pages and links, they often provide 
their own search engine that allows users to find what they need specific to the site. 
Likewise, most browsers provide a search box so you can search for key words or 
characters on the current page.
You can also use search engines to search for information for a specific Web site 
or for a specific domain type. For example, you can search for government Web sites 
or education Web sites.
Not all information on the Web is posted in an HTML file format. For example, 
sometimes when you open a Web page, it prompts you to open the document in 
Adobe Reader. Many academic papers are uploaded to the Web in PDF format.

Lesson 29  Web Content	
Mod3-123
Evaluating the Credibility of Web Page 
Content
The Internet contains Web sites on every imaginable topic and come from sources 
around the world. Anyone can publish information of any type on the Internet—true 
or false, factual or incorrect. The Internet does not enforce rules or quality controls 
about content. Therefore, you should not accept everything as true and accurate. As 
with any other document, you must evaluate the nature and source of the information.
When considering whether to use the content of a Web page, do not accept any 
information presented on the Internet at face value. The source of the information 
should be clearly stated, whether it is original or borrowed from somewhere else. 
Ask yourself the following questions to assess the relevance and reliability of the 
information.
n 
What is the purpose of the Web site?
 
Institutional sites for schools, nonprofit organizations, or government agencies 
should clearly state their mission. A commercial Web site (.com or .net) may be 
presented in a way that promotes a product or service. If the site provides links 
to other sites, the linked sites should contain valuable information that enhances 
your knowledge. Companies pay for online ads to attract you to their products, 
and the messages are not necessarily factual. Sponsored links that pop up on a 
Web page are also a source of advertising, and you should not always consider 
these linked sites as reliable resources.
	
Forums are online discussions among individuals with an interest in a specific 
topic. Although those who participate in the discussions may not be experts, the 
information they provide can be very useful. However, you must still confirm 
the validity of the information shared at all of these types of Web sites. A good 
forum participant only posts good information and does not flame (verbally 
attack or send offensive messages) other participants.
	
A wiki can contain entries from any numbers of users. An entry could be from 
an expert or from a lay person. No qualifications or expertise is required for the 
person contributing to the wiki.
n 
Does the content meet your needs?
	
Explore the information to determine if the information is factual, biased, or 
opinionated. Sometimes articles are published to document research findings, 
but articles are also created to provide product reviews and express personal 
opinions. Ideas and opinions supported by references are additional signs of the 
value of the site.
	
A knowledge base is a collection of data related to a specific subject. Many 
knowledge bases provide frequently asked questions, policies, and manuals. For 
example, a printer manufacturer often provides a Web site with Help menus so 
that users can access information and tutorials to learn about features and Help 
menus to troubleshoot problems.
n 
Is the information accurate, current, and broad enough?
	
To determine the validity of the information, check other online resources, 
books, professional journals, and offline sources that contain similar informa-
tion. Determine if the content is current and if it covers a specific point of view.
n 
Does the information come from a source that can be trusted?
	
Find the author or the company who provided the information. The domain 
name and domain type will indicate the type of source, such as government 
sites, published journals, and personal Web sites.

If someone publishes information 
that is not true and that may give 
another person, business, prod-
uct, group, government, or nation 
a negative image, they can be 
sued for libel and forced to pay 
compensation for any damages 
they caused.

Look for references and links to outside sources that confirm the information. 
For a commercial Web site, you should be able to contact a representative by 
phone or e-mail. For articles and opinions, check to see if there is an option to 
communicate with the Web site author. Confirm the author’s knowledge and 
experience. For example, if the author’s title is a professor at a university, visit 
the university Web site to confirm that the author is on the university staff list.
	
Blogs generally represent the views and beliefs of the author or owner. 
Information might be skewed based on the owner’s personal experiences and 
preferences, so you may or may not agree with information contained on  
the blog.
n 
Is the Web site layout professional?	
	
The overall page layout and ease of navigation is important. The Web site should 
be well-organized and well-designed, and all the links should work effectively.
n 
Is the writing style and language appropriate?
 
The page should be free of spelling and grammatical errors. Even if the page 
appears to contain valuable information, misspelled words and incorrect gram-
mar can be warning signs that the information itself is not completely reliable. 
The style of writing and the language used can also reveal information about 
the quality of the site. If the style is objective, the chances are the information is 
worthy of your attention. However, if the writing style is opinionated and sub-
jective, you may want to reconsider using the site for gaining information.
Observing Intellectual Property Laws
For the most part, information displayed on a Web site is easy to copy. Often you 
can select the text or graphics that you want to copy, use your browser’s Copy com-
mand, and then paste the content into another document. You can also display a page 
on your monitor and print the entire page. The ease with which information can be 
copied, however, does not mean that users have the right to do this.
Most sites have copyright protections. A copyright is the exclusive right, 
granted by law for a certain number of years, to make and use literary, musical, 
or artistic work. The recognition of the ownership of those rights is referred to as  
intellectual property. Even if the copyright notice isn’t displayed prominently on the 
page, someone wrote or is responsible for the creation of the content on a Web page. 
This means that you cannot use the information as your own. You must give credit to 
the person who created the work.
If Internet content, such as a music file, is copyrighted, it cannot be copied with-
out the copyright holder’s permission. To copy without permission is a violation of 
copyright laws. Violating these laws can lead to criminal charges for theft as well as 
civil lawsuits for monetary damages.
A company’s logo or other graphic information may be protected as a  
trademark, which means much the same thing as a copyright but relates specifically 
to the exclusive right to visual or commercial images rather than text or intellectual 
property. In addition, processes and business methods may be protected by patents, 
which guarantee the inventor exclusive rights to the process or method for a certain 
period of time.
When intellectual property rights have been forfeited or expired, then the work 
is considered to be in the public domain and the literary, musical, or artistic work 
is available for anyone to copy or use. Copyright and patent laws do provide certain 
exceptions to the general prohibition against copying. The U.S. copyright law allows 
for the fair use of properly identified copyrighted material that is merely a small part 
of a larger research project or cited as part of a critique or review.

A Creative Commons (CC) license enables authors to control how others may 
use their work. The author keeps the copyright but grants permission to others to use 
their work, as long as those who use the work give the author credit and abide by the 
conditions specified in the license. Many musicians use CC licenses to grant permis-
sion allowing their songs to appear in videos uploaded to YouTube.com. Another 
example where CC licenses are used is Flickr.com, a Web site where you can share 
photos and videos.
CC licenses enable authors to share their knowledge and creativity with the 
world. People can be better informed and work collaboratively and share informa-
tion, which enhances learning and produces new and innovative services that help 
the community.
Copying and Printing Web Page Content
You can copy and save specific elements of a Web page to a disk or to the Cloud 
and then use them in a new document or file. For example, you might want to save 
a photo or copy a paragraph of text you want to quote in a report. You can then open 
the saved files in other programs or paste them into new documents, such as a word-
processing document, where you can edit and manipulate the content as desired.
You can also print a copy of a Web page directly from your browser. Most 
browsers provide page setup options that enable you to control how the Web page 
prints. Sometimes a single Web page will print on multiple sheets of paper, and 
advertisements and Web page instructions will also print. Therefore, it is always best 
to preview how the Web page will print before sending the file to the printer.

Citing Internet Resources
You must cite Internet resources used in reports and other documents. In an aca-
demic setting, claiming someone else’s words, or intellectual property, as your 
own is called plagiarism. You must give proper credit to any information you 
include in a report that is not your original words or ideas. Providing credits 
and ­citations also provides the reader of the document with information about 
­additional research.
Core elements in citing material include the author’s name, the date of publi-
cation or last update, the document or Web page title, the URL where the content 
is hosted, and the date you accessed the source. There are several style prefer-
ences for citing or referencing online sources. Common citation styles include APA 
(American Psychological Association), Chicago/Turabian, and MLA (Modern 
Language Association). It is important for students to follow the style requested by 
the instructor.

Web Content Writer or Developer
If you like to work with Web pages, consider a career as a Web content writer or producer. Writers often 
create press releases, articles, and journal entries for company blogs. To develop Web content, you need to 
be familiar with how search engines work so that your Web pages appear in search results. You also need 
to be proficient with HTML, particularly with writing and formatting text and adding links and keywords to 
a page. Web developers often work with other media such as video or audio and coordinate those sources 
into a Web site. In some cases, you work with Web content using a content management system (CMS), 
which is software that helps you create, edit, manage, and publish content in a consistent format and 
­organization. You might also need to use Web analytics, which are tools for tracking visitors to a Web site 
and determining whether the site meets your business objectives.

Over the last few decades technology has changed and continues to change almost 
every aspect of life. These changes are often swift and dramatic, and the trend of 
electronic innovation affecting daily life is sure to continue. Living in the twenty-
first century means you will need to be tech savvy in order to keep up with these 
swift and dramatic changes. Being able to understand and make use of these elec-
tronic innovations will assist you in many areas of your life—from home, to school, 
and to the workplace.
Using Computers at Work, School, 
and Home
Technology today is integrated into almost every facet of life and influences your 
activities at work, school, and home. You most likely use a computer at your job, 
even if your job doesn’t involve sitting at a desk. Computers are now the norm at 
school. Some schools even provide each student with their own personal computer. 
And computers at home now come in different forms like TVs, gaming consoles, 
tablets, or plain old desktops. Many people have a phone that is also a computer, 
with full Web technology options available for using the Internet while on the go.
Collecting Information
The Internet and the Web are the major forms of technology affecting your life today. 
Using the Internet is a fast and easy way to find the information you need. At home 
and at work, if you need to find the telephone number of a local company or order a 
pizza for lunch, you can use the computer to search for and find the number.
Not so long ago, if a science teacher gave the class a project to find out how anti-
biotics work, the students would go to the library and use encyclopedias and journals 
to research the topic. In most of today’s classrooms, the students browse the Web to 
access the information. See Figure 30–1.

Organizing Information
Computer software helps you organize information. You can use databases and 
spreadsheets to organize and calculate data in a variety of ways. After entering data 
into a database or spreadsheet, you can format, sort, and chart the data. In the work-
place, the company you work for most likely uses spreadsheets for statistical data, 
tax information, or financial reporting. At home, you might use a spreadsheet to 
track a personal budget, list a collection of items such as baseball cards, and docu-
ment expenses for income tax purposes. In the school environment, spreadsheets are 
integrated in curriculum for subjects such as mathematics, business management, 
marketing, and personal finance.
Evaluating Information
In addition to using spreadsheet applications to calculate numeric data, you can use 
spreadsheets to ask what-if questions and evaluate information. Spreadsheets con-
tain mathematic and trigonometry functions as well as statistical functions such as 
Average, Count, Maximum, Minimum, and Percentile. Arranging data in tables and 
lists helps you evaluate the data by comparing one set of calculated results with 
another. Furthermore, creating charts helps you identify patterns or trends in the 
data. See Figure 30–2.

Communicating Information
When computers are connected through a network or to the Internet, users can 
exchange information instantaneously. Technology provides options such as e-mail, 
instant messaging, blogs, and audio visual communication. Access to the Cloud 
allows users to share documents, images, music, and videos.

Collaborating with Others and Solving Problems
You can share information you have stored on your computer or in the Cloud and 
collaborate with co-workers. Using online communities, you can collaborate with 
other people all over the world. The exchange and sharing of ideas on a global basis 
helps you see a problem from different viewpoints.
One type of online collaboration is crowdsourcing, which combines the collec-
tive effort of many people to complete a task. Needed services and ideas are solicited 
from an online community instead of from employees or suppliers. Participants are 
asked to brainstorm, to solve a problem, or share their opinions. See Figure 30–3.

Online communities and social networking sites provide an opportunity to social-
ize with others who have common interests. For example, Instagram is an online 
community where people share photos and videos.
Increasing Productivity
Access to the Internet and the Web can increase your productivity by providing 
online access to multiple resources, including communication with experts and spe-
cialists. Applications can also enhance output and productivity.
Facilitating Learning
The Internet is an amazing resource for learning and discovering new facts and infor-
mation. Many textbooks published today have an associated Web site where stu-
dents can access Web-based projects and find supplemental videos, exercises, and 
activities for the textbook. Look in the front pages of this textbook to see information 
about Web sites that provide additional course materials for this textbook. Many stu-
dents now have the option of using an electronic textbook (eBook) that can be read 
online. EBooks typically provide an electronic version of the full textbook as well 
as the supplemental material. EBooks can lighten the load in your backpack as you 
travel back and forth to school. See Figure 30–4.

Promoting Creativity
Integrating technology into your class work provides you with an opportunity to 
demonstrate your inventiveness, individuality, and creativity. Modern technology 
provides tools you can use to create a range of artistic work that can be published 
for a real audience anywhere in the world. Project-based collaborations can further 
enhance creative learning and problem-solving.
Supporting Critical Thinking
When searching for information on the Internet, you need to use critical thinking. 
Critical thinking is the process of analyzing information, combining information, 
and evaluating information as a guide to making judgments. When reading informa-
tion online, particularly pages that persuade you to buy or do something, do not act 
until you have analyzed the point of view and motivations, gathered and combined 
the information, and evaluated the information. See Figure 30–5.

Using Computer Technology in  
Everyday Life
You probably perform day-to-day activities without thinking about computers and 
how they affect your life. In fact, using desktop and laptop computers represents 
only a fraction of your interactions with computer technology.
Facilitating Daily Life
You can access electronic catalogs, select goods, store them in a digital cart or bag, 
and then complete the purchase with a credit card or an online account. Organizations 
provide more than goods online. For example, if you need tickets for the basketball 
playoffs or an upcoming concert, you can purchase the tickets online, order a pro-
gram, and in some cases select your seats.
Local, state, and national government Web sites provide access to many ser-
vices. For example, many local government agencies provide Web sites where you 
can renew your driver’s license, order vehicle plates, and sign up for municipal ser-
vices. Perhaps you need a tax form—the Internal Revenue Service site provides all 
types of forms and other services so you can file forms electronically and even check 
on your refund. See Figure 30–6.

Automated Teller Machines
Many people with a bank account now take advantage of the convenience of auto-
mated teller machines (ATMs) to deposit or withdraw money. These automated 
banking machines are located at most banks, and they are also available in supermar-
kets, convenience stores, restaurants—even at the ballpark or museum. They allow 
you to do your banking almost anywhere, anytime. Banker’s hours from 9:00 a.m. to 
5:00 p.m. are definitely a thing of the past. See Figure 30–7.

You might not even need to get cash from an ATM for your shopping. Electronic 
checks and debit cards are making cash more obsolete every day. When you swipe 
your ATM card or debit card through the cashier’s machine at your local store 
and then enter your personal identification number (PIN), information about your 
account is transferred to the store’s computers and the amount of your purchase is 
deducted from your checking or savings account.
Credit and Debit Cards
Many people no longer carry large sums of money while traveling. They prefer to 
use ATM or credit cards. The magnetic strip on the back of the card increases effi-
ciency. When you travel, using a card helps you keep track of your travel expenses. If 
you lose a credit card or a debit card, it can be canceled immediately, whereas if your 
money is lost or stolen, the chances of recovery are very small.
A security concern on the Internet, however, is the theft of credit card infor-
mation stored electronically. Because the Internet makes transactions so quick and 
easy, credit card numbers that fall into the wrong hands can cause major prob-
lems for cardholders. Although effective encryption technologies keep credit card 
­numbers secure, you can make your account even more secure by following simple 
precautions. Purchase items only from Web sites that you know are reputable and 
­trustworthy. Read and understand the privacy and consumer-protection policies of 
online ­companies before you buy. Be sure that any credit card information is trans-
mitted in a secured, encrypted mode.

Credit card information is not the only personal information you should protect. 
Take the same precautions whenever you are asked to disclose anything personal, 
such as to market research companies. For example, avoid providing your telephone 
number on Web forms. It usually is not a required field even for online purchases. 
Disclose only what you think is legitimately necessary for the intended purpose. Do 
not provide personal information to unknown parties. Use code names when appro-
priate to protect your identity and personal security. See Figure 30–8.
Point-of-Sale Systems
A terminal used for electronic processing of payment transactions in a retail outlet is 
called a point-of-sale (POS) system. When the cashier scans a product you purchase, 
the pricing comes from a centralized database thousands of miles away. If you use a fre-
quent buyer card, the POS system might record information about your purchase so that 
you receive coupons or other promotions for similar items. Many of the POS systems 
include a complete accounting, inventory, and management system. See Figure 30–9.

Weather-Predicting and Reporting Systems
Several weather-prediction software tools are available. Numerical weather-­prediction 
applications are used by most professional meteorologists. In most applications, 
the user can select the map output or the output statistics model option. The ­output 
­statistics model allows the user to customize the output for particular locations. 
Devices and apps enable you to access real-time weather data and current and con-
tinuously updated weather forecasts.
Global Positioning Systems
A global positioning system (GPS), combined with cell phone technology, can 
provide location information and directions. A GPS can also be a communications 
device for a driver who needs help or has been in an accident. See Figure 30–10.

Embedded Computers in Appliances and Equipment
Though you might not see them, embedded computer systems play an important 
role in your daily life. An embedded computer is a special-purpose computer sys-
tem incorporated into other devices such as automobiles, appliances, and mechani-
cal equipment. Also defined as a single-purpose system, an embedded computer is 
designed to perform one or a few dedicated tasks within a device or appliance.
Newer cars, for example, have embedded computers that control systems such 
as ignition timing and antilock brakes. This is accomplished by using input from a 
number of built-in sensors. Cars are also available with built-in global positioning 
system (GPS) technology.
Almost every home has appliances with embedded computers. Any appliance 
that has a digital clock, for instance, has a small embedded microcontroller that dis-
plays the time. Other examples of appliances and mechanical devices with embed-
ded computers are microwaves, refrigerators, DVR recorders, washing machines, 
and water pumps.
Above and Beyond
Some high-end refrigerators 
include embedded computers 
to adjust defrost cycles to fit 
with usage patterns, regulate 
compartment temperatures, and 
control humidity levels.

Security Systems
Many cars today have a remote keyless ignition system. Pressing a button opens or 
locks the doors, while pressing another button starts the car. Keyless entry systems 
are also available for entrance doors to houses, businesses, and other buildings. Most 
of these systems include a keypad. To open the lock, you press a button on a remote 
control device or enter a combination on the keypad.
Some security systems require sophisticated user identification. For example, 
a biometric device can confirm or deny someone’s identity by matching patterns 
stored in a database with a person’s iris, retina, voice, fingerprint, or handprint. See 
Figure 30–11.

Using Technology to Transform Traditional 
Processes
The integration of personal computers and Internet services has transformed 
many of the traditional procedures and methods used in business, education, and 
government.
E-Commerce
The evolvement of the Internet economy is often compared to the Industrial 
Revolution. E-commerce (an abbreviation for electronic commerce) means con-
ducting business on the Internet. It primarily refers to purchasing and selling prod-
ucts or services on the Internet or through other computer networks. E-commerce is 
changing the way the world does business. Internet speed continues to increase as 
more people add fiber optics, cable modems, or digital subscriber lines (DSL). All of 
this activity and high-speed connection indicate there will be more online businesses 
in the future. See Figure 30–12.

Commercial Web sites enable you to conduct business online. Using e-commerce, 
you can buy and sell just about any product over the Internet. Many people hesitate 
before making online purchases because they fear someone will steal their credit card 
numbers. However, most reputable e-commerce sites have strong encryption tech-
nology to protect personal information, such as pin codes and credit card numbers, 
allowing for safe purchasing transactions between the site and the buyer.
E-commerce also has generated a number of new jobs and new categories of 
jobs. Some examples include Webmasters, programmers, network managers, graphic 
designers, and Web developers. You might also consider starting an online business

greatest source of wealth.
Business Connections
Business-to-business (B2B) describes e-commerce transactions between busi-
nesses, such as between a company and a supplier. This includes the online 
exchange of products, services, or information. Business-to-consumer (B2C) 
describes online transactions between businesses and consumers. A third category 
is business-to-government (B2G), which describes online transactions between 
businesses and governmental agencies.
Retail businesses often use RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags, which 
are small electronic devices used to improve the efficiency of inventory tracking and 
management. The RFID tags identify and track goods from the point of delivery 
or manufacturing to the point of sale. The RFID tags are similar to a bar code, but 
unlike bar codes, scanners can read information from RFID tags from several feet 
away. Governments are using RFID tags in passports and in transportation, such as 
electronic toll collection on highways and in mass transit passes.

Media
In the past, the distribution of media was primarily through newspapers, magazines, 
television, and radio. The Internet opened a new category of communications media. 
Media can be distributed by anyone who has an Internet connection. Music, video, 
audio, pictures, and text can all be distributed online through e-mail, blogs, Web sites, 
and other types of Internet distribution channels such as the Cloud. See Figure 30–13.

Online Learning
For some time, people have been able to obtain their education via distance learn-
ing methods. Earlier nontraditional methods include television and correspondence 
courses that are completed through the mail. Today, there are many opportunities for 
online learning. At the elementary and secondary school levels, the U.S. Department 
of Education supports an initiative called the Star Schools Program. This program 
provides online education to millions of learners annually. Many students in the 
program are able to complete their high school education requirements from home. 
Large numbers of students enroll in enrichment classes or complete a career-training 
program online.
Learning management system programs help teachers deliver online courses. 
These programs are an integrated set of Web-based teaching tools that enable teach-
ers to deliver e-learning courses or training and administer, test, track, and report on 
student performance.
Robotics
When you think of robotics, you might think of humanoid robots such as C-3P0 in 
the movie Star Wars. In real life, however, robotic design did not originally take this 
path. Robots have transformed industrial processes. They are used mostly in assem-
bly plants, often completing dangerous or repetitive tasks. The use of computerized 
robots on assembly lines and in other industrial processes has expanded production 
capabilities in the manufacturing world. Some automated systems are equipped with 
vision technology. Performance is precise, measurements are exact, and production 
is increased. Most manufacturing companies report that after they install automated 
systems, they realize a high return on investment. See Figure 30–14.

More recently, some specialized robots have been developed to have a humanoid 
appearance. Robot devices such as NASA’s Mars twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity 
allow exploration of hostile environments unsafe for humans.
Telecommuting
Many employers allow their employees to work from home. This arrangement is 
called telecommuting. It involves using communications technology to keep the 
employee connected to the office. Telecommuting has many advantages for both 
the employer and the employee. The employer doesn’t incur the overhead expenses 
for office space. For the employee it saves traveling time and commuting expenses, 
and it allows them to work at a time that fits their schedule. Projects and other rel-
evant information can be shared through e-mail and other online distribution options. 
As with in-house employees, companies transfer telecommuting employees’ pay 
directly to their bank account on a regular basis. Insurance and other employment-
related activities are handled automatically online.
Online Communities
Online communities, also known as social networks, virtual communities, and 
e-communities, enable groups of people to interact online rather than face-to-face. 
Social and professional groups use this type of communication to exchange ideas 
around various topics and to share personal information. Facebook and Flickr were 
two of the earlier virtual communities. Some other popular social networks include 
Instagram, Yahoo! Groups, and Google Groups.
Disaster Recovery
Hurricanes, tornadoes, and other recent disasters have increased awareness of the 
need for disaster recovery planning for communities, cities, and states. The content 
of a disaster recovery plan and online resources will vary, based on the location and 
potential hazards. A segment of the plan, however, should include options for elec-
tronic communications, such as a Web site that is updated periodically, e-mail avail-
ability, and available resources and locations where help can be provided.

It is sometimes difficult for the physically challenged to attend classes. 
E-learning and online courses are offered throughout the world by public and private 
educational institutions.
Assistive technology is not limited to computers. To make it easier for people 
with disabilities to board the bus, a “smart bus” provides steps that can be lowered, 
and it also has a lift for a wheelchair. Furthermore, personal computers offer acces-
sibility options that permit people with many types of disabilities to work and 
­communicate more easily.
Identifying Assistive Technologies
Advances in technology assist us in many ways. Assistive technologies are software 
and devices used to maintain, increase, or improve the functional capabilities of indi-
viduals with disabilities.
Microsoft provides many options and settings in the operating system to make 
it easier for people of all ages and abilities to see, hear, and use their computers. For 
example, changing the keyboard and mouse settings can make it easier to type and 
control the mouse. Replacing sounds with visual clues can help those with hearing 
impairments.
Electronic software and devices help disabled people communicate, become 
more mobile, and participate in activities. For example, TDD (telecommunications 
device for the deaf) technology allows hearing-impaired people to use a telephone.
Several adaptive software options are available to aid people with vision impair-
ment. These software options include screen readers that provide alternative sensory 
guidance for computer navigation. Scanning and reading software, Braille translators, 
and text-to-speech applications can be utilized to help people with vision ­challenges. 
Voice recognition tools enable you to dictate text and commands on computers and 
other electronic devices such as tablets and smart phones. See Figure 30–15.

Simulation Analysts
A simulation analyst studies activities and procedures and makes recommendations for the most efficient 
solutions to meet both the business and technology needs of a company or organization. For example, a 
bank converting to a new system to process checks may hire a system analyst to evaluate the computer 
system. The system analyst must identify the technical and operational problems, develop solutions, and 
implement them.
A system analyst must be a logical thinker and have good analytical skills. The analyst must also have 
a solid understanding of computer hardware and software. Because businesses and organizations rely on 
computer systems, opportunities and the need for system analysts are increasing.

Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
Computers are used in different areas of work, school, and 
home to collect, organize, evaluate, and communicate infor-
mation. Computers help users increase productivity, collabo-
rate with others, facilitate learning, promote creativity, support 
critical thinking, and facilitate daily life.
n 
Desktop and laptop computers represent only a fraction of 
interaction with computer technology. Daily, we use auto-
mated teller machines, credit cards, automated industrial pro-
cesses, point-of-sale systems, weather-predicting and reporting 
systems, global positioning systems, embedded computers in 
appliances and equipment, and security systems.
n 
The integration of personal computers and Internet services has 
transformed many of the traditional procedures and methods in 
business, education, and government. E-commerce, business 
connections, media, online learning, robotics, telecommuting, 
online communities, and disaster recovery are examples of 
how much has changed.

Module 3  Living Online
Using computers and the Internet offers unrivaled access to commerce, entertain-
ment, and information, but it also exposes you to breaches in security, privacy, and 
ethics. Computer workstation environments can also be potential hazards. This 
­lesson explores the measures you can take to minimize those risks.
Addressing Security Risks
You secure data in order to protect it from harm or destruction from natural causes, 
accidents, and intentional damage. It is not always evident that some type of com-
puter crime or intrusion has occurred. Therefore, you need to set up safeguards for 
each type of risk. Computer security can keep hardware, software, and data safe.
Avoiding Data Loss
An example of an ever-present threat to a computer system is an electrical power 
failure. Electricity not only provides the power to operate a computer, but it is also 
the medium a computer uses to store data. An unexpected power outage can wipe out 
any data that has not been properly saved.
One easy way to avoid data loss is to save data files frequently. Most software 
programs provide an option that can be set to save data periodically. For instance, 
suppose you are working on a multi-page report. If your computer loses power and 
does not have battery backup power, you may lose all your work. However, if your 
application is set to save on a regular basis, such as every ten minutes, then you can 
retrieve at least a portion of your report.
To safeguard computer systems against power outages, install a battery 
backup supply to provide power in the event the normal current is interrupted. You 
should also use surge protectors to prevent hardware and software damage from 
power spikes.
Hard drives are mechanical devices, and they all fail eventually, preventing 
access to the data they store. A hard disk crash can result in a catastrophic loss of 
data if the files have not been backed up properly. To protect your data, you can back 
up important files to independent storage locations such as an external hard drive, 
the Cloud, or a flash drive. You can also subscribe to an online backup service for a 
minimal price.
Your backup procedures should be repeated regularly and should place a pri-
ority on files that would be difficult or impossible to replace or reconstruct if you 
lost them. Secure backup procedures used by large organizations include a regular 
schedule for backing up designated files and a means of storing backup files off-site 
so that they will remain intact if the main system is destroyed.
Restricting Access
The best way to protect data is to effectively control access to it. If unauthorized 
people gain access to data, they may obtain valuable information. System adminis-
trators and users often restrict access to files, storage devices, computers, networks, 
the Internet, or specific Internet sites.
Using Firewalls
Computer hacking involves invading someone else’s computer, usually for personal 
gain or the satisfaction of defeating a security system. Hackers are usually computer 
experts who enjoy having the power to invade someone else’s privacy. They can 
change or damage data stored on a computer, or they can use or sell the data. It is 
estimated that hacking causes billions of dollars of damage each year, along with the 
theft of important and valuable data.

Lesson 31  Computer Safety and Ethics	
Mod3-153
A firewall protects against unwanted access or use to or from a network. The 
firewall analyzes data based on the specified security criteria. A firewall can be 
implemented in software or hardware. A personal firewall is generally installed with 
an operating system. For example, Windows 8 provides a firewall. If the network is 
small, a personal firewall is sufficient. Many routers contain firewall components. 
Using the personal firewall along with a router firewall reinforces the network secu-
rity. However, if the network is large, a hardware firewall that controls all the com-
puters from one point should be implemented. This type of firewall is more secure 
and requires expert setup.
Firewalls are an essential part of making sure you are safe and secure when 
using the Internet. To access an unsecured wireless connection, a hacker needs only a 
computer and eavesdropping software to connect directly to an unsecured computer. 
Once connected, the intruder can scrutinize your computer for personal data such as 
user names, passwords, tax records, Social Security and credit card numbers, and 
other personal information. An unauthorized user could also tap into your network 
for illegal or criminal activity. If the unauthorized user is part of the network and 
is working behind a gateway device, any activity coming from the intruder could 
appear to be coming from your computer, meaning you could be held responsible for 
the illegal activity. It is good practice to frequently check to make sure the firewall 
is turned on.

Module 3  Living Online
Using Passwords
Almost all routers and access points have a factory-set administrator password, 
which is often a common word such as “password.” Some devices do not have a 
default password at all. When setting up your network, your first step should be 
to change the default password and then write it down so that you can refer to it if 
needed. Second, turn on some form of encryption. Several forms of encryption tech-
nologies are available. You need to select the one that works best with your network 
devices. Turn off the network during extended periods when you are not using it.
Companies often establish password-protected locations on hard drives and 
networks so that designated users can access specific files. Web sites also require 
passwords to access account information or make transactions. For your personal 
computer, you can set a password to log on to the computer.
The challenge is to create strong passwords that are easy for you to remember 
but difficult for anyone else to decipher. A strong password is both complex and 
secure—it contains numbers, letters, and special characters that do not include per-
sonal information such as a name or birth date. In addition, strong passwords contain 
at least eight characters, and at least one letter, number, and special character (such 
as @, $, *, or !). Also, using upper and lowercase letters makes the password even 
more complex.
Microsoft provides a password checker that you can use to evaluate the strength 
of a password. See Figure 31–2. Go to https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-­
security/password-checker.aspx.
3-5.1.1
3-5.1.2
Figure 31–2  Check password strength
If you are currently using weak passwords, you should create new, strong pass-
words as soon as possible. If you’ve just experienced a breach in security, change 
your passwords immediately. In some cases, it is recommended that you should 
change your passwords on a regular basis. For example, corporate login passwords 
are changed frequently because employee positions continuously change, thereby 
changing who should have access to specific files. Hackers often stalk your e-mail 
messages for an extended period of time to get sensitive information from you, so it 
is recommended that you change e-mail passwords frequently.
Passwords for two-step verifications do not need to be changed as often because 
the second step adds an additional layer of security. Two-step verifications require 
more information than a password to authenticate your identity. For example, when 
you log in to an online account, the first step is to enter a username and password. 
The second step is to enter a PIN number or a security passcode. Many online ser-
vices support two-factor authentication, including Facebook, Google Mail, and 
Yahoo! Mail. You can enable the security option in Facebook to require a security 
code when your account is accessed by a computer or phone that is not recognized.
If you write down a password, keep it in a secure place and do not share it with 
anyone else. Unauthorized access is much more likely to be caused by people who 
gain access through a written or shared password than by anyone guessing your user 
name and password.

Using Protection Programs
Software programs and computer utilities enable you to control Internet use and 
monitor computer usage.
Internet services such as e-mail and file transfers can be blocked for specific 
users or for all users. Furthermore, access to Web sites can be blocked. Protecting 
children from unsuitable Web sites is a concern for parents, teachers, libraries, and 
other areas where children have computer access. Filtering is used to block content 
coming into and going out to the Internet. For example, a browser filter will block a 
Web page when a forbidden word is matched in the Web page content. E-mail filters 
inspect incoming and outgoing mail. See Figure 31–3.

are inspected for spam and viruses. In an education environment, using filtering 
means children cannot access inappropriate Web sites. In the workplace, filtering 
ensures that employees cannot use company computers for personal use. There are 
also some drawbacks. Search results on the Web are limited, and a site with valuable 
information may be blocked. Also, important e-mail messages may not be delivered.
Monitoring computer usage can assure that students are using computers safely 
and appropriately. Parental control software enables parents to track their children’s 
computer activity and block access to Web sites. By monitoring their activity, par-
ents can make sure their children don’t overshare information that would compro-
mise their safety.

Many businesses monitor the computer activity of their employees. Obviously, 
businesses might track the computer activity to assess productivity by document-
ing the amount of time the employee spends on the computer. However, businesses 
also monitor computer activity for security purposes. Employees can either inadver-
tently or intentionally jeopardize a business by revealing sensitive information. For 
example, competition among companies for a government contract or a bid on new 
business can encourage some employees to overshare information with competitors. 
Malicious tampering can also result in data loss. A disgruntled employee can will-
fully delete vital records and other important data.
Protecting Against Malware
In an information-driven world, people and organizations must manage and protect 
against malware risks. Malware refers to any software that is designed to cause dam-
age to a single computer, server, or computer network. See Figure 31–4.
3-5.1.2
A virus is a program that has been written, usually by a hacker, to corrupt data on 
a computer. Often, you can inadvertently run the virus program by opening an e-mail 
message or attachment. The virus is attached to a file such as a program file, a docu-
ment, or the e-mail message, and it spreads from one file to another when the program 
is executed. A virus can do something as minor as display messages on your screen, 
or it can cause major damage to the computer data. There are several types of viruses.
n	
A worm virus makes many copies of itself, consuming system resources so that 
the computer slows down or actually halts tasks. Worms don’t have to attach 
themselves to other files.
n 
A time bomb is a virus that does not cause damage until a specified date or until 
the system has been launched a certain number of times.
n 
A logic bomb is a virus triggered by the appearance or disappearance of speci-
fied data.
n 
A Trojan horse is a virus that does something different from what it is expected 
to do. It may look like it is performing one task while it is actually performing 
an opposite task (usually something disastrous).
A keylogger is a malicious program that records keystrokes. For example, a key-
logger might record your keystrokes to keep track of the Web sites you visit, the user 
names and passwords you enter, and your private information such as credit card and 
account numbers. Because they can aid identity theft, keyloggers are a particularly 
dangerous type of harmful software.

Spyware is software fraudulently installed on a personal computer. The goal is 
to collect information about the user, the user’s browsing habits, and other personal 
information. Spyware can significantly slow the performance of your computer, dis-
play annoying pop-up ads, and change system settings. Spyware can be harmful as 
well as annoying. Hackers often use spyware to control your browser. The spyware 
might replace your home page with another, often to increase the number of visits 
to the replacement page, which can boost advertising revenue. Antispyware software 
is available, but make sure you use reputable antispyware programs—some spyware 
disguises itself as antispyware to gain access to your system.
Protecting a system requires a number of security tools. You should use strong 
passwords and download and install the latest security updates for your operating 
system. Antivirus software should always be running on your computer, and the 
software should be updated regularly. Many programs have settings to automati-
cally update, or notifications that tell you when it is time for a manual update.
Disregarding False Information
Electronic fraud, such as e-mail fraud, is a computer crime that involves the manip-
ulation of a computer or computer data to dishonestly obtain money, property, infor-
mation, or other things of value, or to cause loss. The U.S. Secret Service reports 
that hundreds of millions of dollars are lost annually due to fraudulent activities. 
See Figure 31–5.
Warning
Although they appear to be 
harmless, many free programs 
that you download via the 
Internet are malicious. They 
monitor your keystrokes and 
track your Internet logins. 
Some of these programs install 
on your device when you click 
an ad or an Internet link.

E-mail messages are often used for fraudulent activities. Beware of messages you 
receive from e-mail addresses or senders you do not recognize. In many instances, 
the messages are well-written and appear to be legitimate. Typically, the messages 
request money for one reason or another. Unless you know the reason to be true, do 
not send a response to a message that requests money or personal information.
A hoax is an attempt to deceive an audience into believing that something false 
is real. Sometimes a hoax takes the form of a practical joke with a humorous intent; 
other times, it is an attempt to defraud and mislead. Many e-mail hoaxes are passed 
along in electronic chain letters and appear to be warnings about potential computer 
viruses, but the e-messages actually contain a virus themselves.

It is not always easy to spot an e-mail or chain letter containing a virus, but 
looking for some of the following hallmarks helps detect possible harmful files. If 
you identify any of these characteristics, it is wise to delete the e-mail immediately.
n	
The e-mail is a warning message about a virus.
n	
The message might be very wordy, contain all capital letters, or include dozens 
of exclamation marks.
n	
The message urges you to share information with everyone you know.
n	
The message appears credible because it describes the virus in technical terms.
n	
The message comes with an attachment, and you do not know who it is from.
Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to steal personal information to commit iden-
tity theft. This type of message appears to come from a legitimate source, such as 
your bank, an auction site, or the IRS. The message asks that you click a link in the 
e-mail message to update or verify your personal information. When you click the 
link, you are directed to a bogus Web site, one that disguises its URL so it looks like 
you are visiting a legitimate Web site.
Also be suspicious of messages that solicit private information (such as a Social 
Security number or an account number) to verify your account. Messages like these 
appear to be from legitimate companies, but they are usually fraudulent scams for 
identity theft. Most companies assure customers that they would never ask for sen-
sitive information in an e-mail, so do not respond to these e-mails. Do not click on 
links in these e-mails because they may direct you to a bogus Web site run by a con 
artist, or they may download malicious files to your computer. If you have ques-
tions or want to report fraud, go directly to the Web site by entering the URL in the 
Address bar or contact the company by phone.
Nearly all e-mail programs provide security settings, phishing filters, encryp-
tion, and spam filters. It is important that you enable these options so you don’t 
become a victim to scams and identity theft.
Confirming E-Commerce Safety
A common security concern is providing credit card information over the Internet. 
Before providing personal information or credit card information on an e-commerce 
or similar site, first verify that the site is secure.
Web sites used for financial transactions or e-commerce usually use encrypted 
communication to make them more secure. Before you make a financial transaction 
online, you need to confirm that you have a secure and encrypted connection. Most 
secure Web sites require you to log on using an account or user name and a pass-
word. After you log on to your account, you might see a message indicating that 
you are now entering (or leaving) a secure Web address. In the Address bar, the 
URL should begin with “https” rather than “http.” The letter “s” indicates that the 
Web site is secure. You should also see a padlock icon in the Address bar. See 
Figure 31–6.
Quick Tip
The FBI has a cybercrime branch 
that concentrates in particular on 
Internet fraud, including identity 
theft. See www.fbi.gov/about-us/
investigate/cyber/cyber for more 
information.
Quick Tip
You can enable settings in your 
e-mail program to encrypt mes-
sages. Encrypting an e-mail 
message requires that you 
obtain a digital signature from a 
Certificate Authority.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology and its predecessor Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) technology encrypt sensitive information and authenticate servers and 
clients to ensure a secure connection. The differences are minor. TLS uses stronger 
encryption algorithms and has the ability to work on different ports. TLS and SSL use 
public key encryption to authenticate the server to the client. The public key encryp-
tion system works like a lock and a key. The public key encrypts information and the 
private key deciphers the information. A digital certificate is an electronic document 
that verifies the identity of a person or company and confirms that they own a public 
key. TLS and SSL use certificate authorities to confirm that the certificate comes 
from a trusted party, the certificate is currently valid, and that the certificate has a 
relationship with the site from which it comes.
When you click the padlock icon in the Address bar, information about the iden-
tity of the Web site is provided. As shown in Figure 31–7, the information confirms 
that the connection to the server is encrypted. You can click the View certificates link 
for information about a digital certificate.

Follow these guidelines when you provide information at an e-commerce Web site:
n	
Use a PC that you know is secure.
n	
Make sure firewalls and anti-virus software features are enabled.
n	
Make purchases from Web sites that you know are reputable and trustworthy.
n	
Verify that any credit card information is transmitted in a secured, encrypted mode.
n	
Before you provide any personal or financial information to a Web site, look for 
and read the site’s privacy policy. A link to the privacy policy is often listed at 
the bottom of the home page. 
n	
Make sure that you log off from the Web site at the end of the session.
Removing Sensitive Data from Devices
Before you sell, donate, recycle, or dispose of electronic devices, be sure to back up 
your data. If you are using a mobile device, most of your data is likely synchronized 
with online services. And just as important, don’t forget to remove the sensitive data 
to prevent unauthorized retrieval and use of the information.

Moving files into the device’s trash folder and then emptying the trash folder 
removes only the records of the files. Residual files are left on hard drives, flash 
drives, and portable drives, and the data can still be recovered. You can hire a pro-
fessional to wipe the data, or you can remove the data yourself. You can also look 
for information at the manufacturer’s Web site about advice for removing data from  
a device.
To fully wipe data from a computer, you can reformat the hard drive or you 
can reinstall the operating system. If you have a traditional magnetic hard drive, 
reformatting it and reinstalling the operating system won’t erase every sector of the 
disk. You can use programs specifically designed to remove data, such as Eraser 
for Windows or Permanent Eraser for MacIntosh. These programs write over each 
sector multiple times to ensure that the data is completely removed.
The Reset Your PC feature is available on computers running Windows 8. The 
feature erases your entire device and resets Windows back to its factory default state. 
If your computer is running Windows 8, you can use the Reset Your PC feature to 
set Windows back to its factory default state. If your computer has a magnetic hard 
drive, be sure to select the “Fully clean the drive” option.
If you do not trust that all the data has been removed from a hard drive, remove 
the drive and destroy it. For example, hit it with a hammer to break it into pieces. See 
Figure 31–9. Data cannot be fully removed from flash drives. To extinguish the data, 
destroy the flash drive.

The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for your mobile phone holds your 
personal identity information and also cell phone numbers, text messages, and the 
(SD) card stores data such as photos and music. The easiest way to fully wipe data 
from a smart phone is to remove the SIM and SD cards. If you must leave the cards 
with the phone when you exchange the phone, check your manufacturer’s Web site 
for information about how to fully wipe the data from the cards.

Protecting Privacy on the Internet
The amount of personal information available online for the average computer user 
is astonishing. The major source of revenue for some companies comes from gather-
ing information about consumers and other computer users to create databases and 
sell or trade this information to others.
Any time you submit information on the Internet, it is possible for this informa-
tion to be gathered by many persons and used for various situations. Information can 
also be gathered from online data regarding school, banking, hospitals, insurance, 
and any other information supplied for such everyday activities.
Much of the information gathered and sold results in your name being added 
to mailing lists. These lists are used by companies for marketing purposes. Junk 
e-mails are used for the same purpose. Information regarding one’s credit history is 
also available to be sold.
A cookie is a small text file that a Web site’s server puts on your computer to

Even though security and privacy of personal information on the Internet 
is improving, it is still necessary to take precautions to protect both personal and 
business-related information. To protect your privacy online, follow these guidelines:
n 
Keep your operating system updated.
n 
Use code names instead of real names. This also applies to protecting personal 
or family information in public places as well.
n 
When communicating on a forum, blog, social network, or other similar 
Internet-related sites, use an alias.
n 
Verify that you have logged off a computer used in a public place such as a 
hotel, public library, a school, or other similar institutions.
n 
Monitor your credit reports and check your credit history at least once a year.
Maintaining a Healthy Computing 
Environment
Maintaining a proper workspace not only affects your productivity, but it is also criti-
cal for both short-term and long-term health. Make sure you use a computer in a way 
that supports your comfort, health, and safety. Whether you use a desktop computer 
provided by your school or other organization, a notebook computer at home or in an 
outdoor café, or a smart phone when you are on the go, pay attention to your posture, 
lighting, and activity level.
Equipment, tools, furniture, and the visual demands of working at a computer 
all have a direct effect on posture. The physical arrangement of hardware and sup-
plies can cause poor body posture, which can cause chronic physical conditions such 
as headaches, aching muscles, and back pain. See Figure 31–11.

When you use a computer, take precautions to avoid chronic physical maladies 
such as repetitive motion injuries, eyestrain, and back problems that can arise over 
time. Ergonomic design adapts equipment and the workplace to fit the worker. A com-
puter workstation should be adjusted to fit the needs of the user, and working postures 
will differ from one employee to another. For optimal comfort and safety, arrange the 
computer workstation so that the user can work comfortably. See Figure 31–12.

Quick Tip
Users who wear bifocals may 
need to position the monitor 
lower and tilt the monitor upward 
slightly to avoid having to tilt 
their head backward.
n 
The desk or work surface should be an appropriate height, whether the user is 
sitting or standing. An adjustable height desk allows you to raise and lower the 
work surface and monitor, enabling users to switch between sitting and standing 
throughout the day. There should be enough space on the work surface so that 
the computer, keyboard, and pointing device are all within easy reach.
n 
When sitting at a workstation, use a chair that can be adjusted to match the user’s 
height. When sitting in the chair, knees should be positioned at the same level or 
lower than the hips. The chair should also provide back support to reduce stress on 
the lower back. Adjustable and padded armrests help prevent neck and shoulder pain.
n 
If possible, use a keyboard tray so that the keyboard and mouse can be centered 
directly in front of the user. A keyboard tray provides a comfortable level and 
minimizes the strain on the shoulders. Ergonomic keyboards and mice provide 
natural angles and curves that help you rest your wrists and palms and minimize 
repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel pressure.
n 
There must be adequate space for feet and legs under the work surface so the 
user can sit with appropriate posture. If possible, provide a foot rest to reduce 
pressure on the lower back.
n 
Staring at a computer screen can cause short-term eye strain and long-term 
vision problems. The distance between the user and the monitor should be at 
least 20 inches (or arm’s length). Larger monitors can be positioned further 
away. The best angle is to position the monitor directly in front of the user, with 
the top of the monitor positioned at eye level, or just below. If the monitor is too 
high, the user will work with their head, neck, and shoulders tilted back, which 
will cause muscle strain. Overhead lighting should be dim. Be sure the worksta-
tion is positioned so that sunlight does not cause glare on a computer screen, 
which causes users to squint and sit in awkward positions. Computer eyewear 
can reduce the glare and increase the contrast.

Sitting in the same position for long periods of time causes muscle fatigue and 
discomfort. Maintaining good posture and changing positions throughout the day 
are effective ways to minimize stress and strain on the muscles. Be sure to change 
your position often. For example, stand up and walk around for a few minutes and 
stretch your fingers, hands, arms, and torso. Also, take regular breaks to allow your 
eye muscles to relax.
Using a notebook computer introduces risks not associated with desktop com-
puters. Avoid setting a notebook computer directly on your lap or on a soft, flexible 
surface such as a cushion, which might obstruct air vents and cause the computer to 
overheat. Use a cooling pad to keep air flowing around the notebook and the battery 
or AC adapter.
Tablet PCs are light and portable, which allows users to change position fre-
quently. If buttons and other controls are easy to access with natural hand and finger 
movements, tablet users can also avoid computer-related injuries. Some tablet users, 
however, use poor posture when typing on a tablet, which puts them at risk for neck 
and shoulder pain.
Using Computers and Devices Responsibly
Certain responsibilities govern your use of computers, devices, and online services, 
including following guidelines and policies, exercising ethical behavior, and respect-
ing copyright laws.
Complying with Guidelines and Policies
When you are using a computer owned by a school or other organization, follow the 
organization’s guidelines for electronic communications. Nearly all schools, gov-
ernment agencies, companies, libraries, and other similar institutions have written 
policies and guidelines for using the systems ethically, professionally, and legally. 
These policies protect the organization as well as the user. Before you access the 
Internet, send e-mail, exchange files, or otherwise use a computer at school or work, 
make sure you are familiar with the usage policies. If these policies are not readily 
available, ask a system administrator or other employee for a copy of the policy. See 
Figure 31–13.

If you use a company computer, the information you send and receive is the 
company’s property. Generally, any information gathered from a company’s com-
puter system is company property and not an individual worker’s personal property. 
Likewise, the same laws apply to educational institutions. Any information stored 
on a computer in an educational facility is school property. The organization has a 
right to access any data on their computers and monitor activity including the usage 
of applications, Web history, and more. Companies can also use portable devices to 
monitor text messages and GPS locations. The employee/student normally has no 
right to personal privacy regarding those issues.
Internet censorship is the suppression of Web content that is considered offen-
sive or a threat to security. The government censors the content published on the 
Web to protect citizens and businesses. However, there are debates about whether the 
censorship of the Internet violates human rights for freedom of speech.
Exercising Ethical Behavior
When using information technology, ethical behavior goes beyond following guide-
lines and legal requirements. Ethical behavior is proper behavior. When making 
decisions, not only should you follow the rules, but you should also consider how 
your actions will affect individuals. Respecting the rights and privacy of others is 
important, both online and offline.
Identity theft is an example of unethical behavior. There may be some short-
term rewards for those who commit identity theft; however, there are also some long-
term consequences when convicted of a felony crime. The impact on victims can be 
very devastating. Not only do victims often suffer from financial damages, they also 
suffer from anxiety and frustration, and sometimes there are criminal ramifications 
that need to be resolved.
Using Software Legally
It is also your responsibility to respect copyright law. Software must be legitimately 
licensed before it can be used, and there are different ways software can be distrib-
uted and licensed. In organizations, it is the system administrator’s responsibility to 
install and use only legitimately licensed software. Users of personal computers are 
also responsible for installing and staying informed about licensed programs and 
downloading valid software.
Software piracy is the unlawful reproduction and/or distribution of any copy-
righted digital files including videos, music, e-books, and software. Piracy is steal-
ing. It is easy to download or copy files. See Figure 31–14. Even though you will 
likely not get caught stealing the files, it is still an unethical use of technology. To 
respect copyrights and do what is right, you should pay for retail software and obey 
the terms and conditions for using all software programs.

Figure 31–14  Downloading software
During the installation process, users are often asked to accept a contract of 
agreement, sometimes referred to as the end User License Agreement. Traditional 
licenses apply to a single user with a physical device. Network licensing allows 
a business or organization to install the software on more than one computer or 
device. The benefits of network licensing include reduced costs and the ability to 
share resources. For example, a site license may permit up to 12 users to access 
software via a network and at the same time. Therefore, the software does not need 
to be installed on every computer or device. When accessing software via a network, 
Intranet, or the Internet, users must normally log in with a user name and password.
Software licensing differs among types of software. There are alternative methods 
of distributing and licensing software beyond traditional purchasing. Retail software is 
produced for sale and for profit. Free software is often bundled with hardware purchases, 
and there are also free software programs that you can download from the Internet. 
n 
Public domain software belongs to the public, so the software licensing has no 
restrictions.
n 
Freeware programs allow you to download and use the software at no cost, or 
for a voluntary fee. The license generally has a few restrictions. The creator 
of the software retains the copyright, and the license usually allows unlimited 
copying and distribution but forbids any changes to the program.
n 
Shareware programs are initially available for free trial for a specified period 
of time. Shareware provides an opportunity for users to try the software before 
they buy it. The license generally requires that users pay a fee for continued use.
n 
Open source programs refers to software in which the source code is available 
free of charge to the general public for use and/or modification. Programmers 
typically develop the software in a public and collaborative manner. Licenses 
normally give end-users the right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the 
programs.
n 
The use of Software as a Service (SaaS) and Application Service Provider 
(ASP) is growing. SaaS and ASP provide remote access to software applications 
hosted on the Internet. Instead of acquiring licenses and installing software, 
users can use SaaS and ASP to remotely access software applications via a Web 
browser. Webmail and SkyDrive are common examples. Often advertisers pay 
for the service, so the user gets the service for free. Licenses normally restrict 
usage and require you to register and log in with a user name and a password.
When downloading and installing software, regardless of the type of software, make 
sure you access the files from authorized sources, that you have valid software licenses, 
and that you use the software responsibly as specified in the contract of agreement.

Physical Security
In addition to protecting data, users should also take steps to secure their computer hardware. It is gener-
ally fairly easy for an unauthorized person to steal a computer or device from a user’s desk or in a public 
environment. Locks are available to secure most desktop computers and laptops. Portable devices such as 
laptops, tablets, and smart phones are especially vulnerable to theft. All devices should require a password 
for a log-in. Never leave your device unattended, even in your office setting. When you leave your office for 
a meeting or a lunch break, lock portable devices and flash drives in a desk drawer.
ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY
Summary
In this lesson, you learned:
n 
The best way to protect data is to effectively control access to 
it. System administrators and users often restrict access to files, 
storage devices, various computers, networks, the Internet, or 
specific Internet sites.
n 
Strong passwords are both complex and secure. The challenge 
is to create strong passwords that are easy for you to remember 
but difficult for anyone else to decipher.
n 
Software programs and computer utilities enable you to con-
trol Internet use and monitor computer usage.
n 
It is important to watch for hallmarks of false information or 
hoaxes in e-mail messages as well as characteristics of pos-
sible harmful files.
n 
Protecting a system against malware risks requires a number 
of security tools. Electronic fraud is a computer crime that 
involves the manipulation of a computer or computer data.
n 
Before providing personal information or credit card informa-
tion on an e-commerce or similar site, first verify that the site is 
secure.
n 
Before you sell, donate, recycle, or dispose of electronic 
devices, be sure to remove the sensitive data to prevent unau-
thorized retrieval and use of the information.
n 
Any time you submit information on the Internet, it is possible 
for this information to be gathered and sold or traded to others.
n 
Maintaining a proper workspace not only affects your produc-
tivity, but it is also critical for both short-term and long-term 
health. Make sure you use a computer in a way that supports 
your comfort, health, and safety.
n 
Following guidelines and policies, exercising ethical behavior, 
and respecting copyright laws govern your use of computers, 
devices, and online services.

Appendix A  Using Windows 7
In this lesson, you learn how to perform basic computer tasks using Windows 7. You 
start by displaying the desktop and starting applications. Next, you use Windows 
Explorer to view folders and files and then navigate from one folder to another. You 
also manage files by creating a file, copying it, renaming the file, and then moving it. 
Finally, you explore the Control Panel and shut down Windows 7.
Touring Windows 7
Windows 7 is a popular operating system developed by Microsoft Corporation. If you 
are using a computer that runs Windows 7, the operating system starts when you turn 
on the computer. After completing its start-up tasks, Windows 7 displays a Welcome 
screen, which lists all the users for the computer. Before you begin working with 
Windows 7, you might need to click your user name (a unique name that identifies 
you to Windows 7) and type a password (a confidential series of characters).
In Step-by-Step A.1, you start Windows 7. Make sure your computer is turned 
off before you perform the following steps.
Step-by-Step A.1
	 1.	 Turn on your computer. After a moment, Windows 7 starts and the 
Welcome screen appears.
	 2.	 On the Welcome screen, click your user name and enter your password, 
if necessary. The Windows 7 desktop appears, as shown in Figure A–1. 
Your desktop might look different.

Quick Tip
To use WordPad, you type text at 
the insertion point, and then use 
the controls on the Ribbon to for-
mat the text, insert other objects 
such as pictures, and change the 
view of the WordPad window.
Running Multiple Applications
Because Windows 7 is a multitasking operating system, you can run more than one 
program at a time. As you saw in Step-by-Step A.2, when you start an application, 
its button appears on the taskbar. If two or more applications are open and running, 
you can switch from one application to another by clicking the appropriate button 
on the taskbar.
In Step-by-Step A.3, you start Paint, a graphics-editing application, and then 
switch from Paint to WordPad.
Step-by-Step A.3
	 1.	 Click the Start button 
 on the taskbar, point to All Programs, click 
Accessories, and then click Paint. The Paint application starts and 
opens on the desktop.
	 2.	 If the Paint window is maximized, click the Restore Down button 
 
on the Paint title bar and then drag the Paint window by its title bar if 
necessary to display some of the WordPad window. See Figure A–5.

Paint is now the active application because its window appears in front 
of the WordPad window. You should know which application is active because 
Windows applies your next keystroke or command to the active application. 
Because only one application is active at a time, you need to switch between 
applications if you want to work in one or the other. Next, you make WordPad 
the active application.
	 3.	 Click the WordPad button 
 on the taskbar. The WordPad window 
moves to the front, indicating that WordPad is the active application.
Quick Tip
To use Paint, you select a tool 
on the Ribbon, and then click or 
drag in the window to draw or 
edit an image in the Paint 
window.

Appendix A  Using Windows 7
	 4.	 Click the Minimize button 
 on the WordPad title bar. The WordPad 
window is reduced, so that only the WordPad button on the taskbar is 
displayed. The WordPad button is still highlighted on the taskbar, indi-
cating that its window is still open, though it is not displayed on the 
desktop.
Closing Applications
When you are finished using an application, you should close (or exit) the applica-
tion to conserve system resources. To close an application, you can click the Close 
button located in the upper-right corner of the application window. If the application 
window is minimized, you can close the application by using the shortcut menu 
­associated with the application button on the taskbar. (You can also close open 
windows using the shortcut menu.)
In Step-by-Step A.4, you close Paint using the Close button, and you close 
WordPad using the taskbar button shortcut menu.
Using Windows Explorer
To discover the files and folders stored on your computer, you can use Windows 
Explorer, which is a Windows 7 application designed to help you navigate your 
computer. Like the Start menu, Windows Explorer has two panes. The left pane is 
the Navigation pane, which lists icons for the drives, folders, libraries, and other 
resources you can access on your computer. When you select an object such as a 
folder icon in the Navigation pane, its contents appear in the right pane. Instead of a 
Ribbon, the Windows Explorer window includes a menu bar and a toolbar you use to 
perform tasks. As you open folders and navigate with Windows Explorer, the buttons 
on the toolbar change so that they are appropriate for your current task. In addition, 
Windows Explorer has a Details pane at the bottom of the window, which displays 
details about the selected object.
In Step-by-Step A.5, you start Windows Explorer and examine its window.
Quick Tip
In Windows Explorer, a library 
displays files and folders of files 
of a similar type together, no 
matter where they are stored, so 
you can locate them easily.
Step-by-Step A.4
	 1.	 Click the Close button 
 on the Paint title bar to exit Paint. The 
Paint button no longer appears on the taskbar.
	 2.	 Right-click the WordPad button 
 on the taskbar, and then click Close 
window on the shortcut menu to exit WordPad.

Appendix A  Using Windows 7
Changing View Settings
Windows 7 provides various ways to view the contents of a folder, including Extra 
Large Icons, Large Icons, Medium Icons, Small Icons, List, Details, Tiles, and 
Content. The default view for folders in the Pictures library is Large Icons view, 
which displays a thumbnail showing the file contents. For all other folders, the 
default is Details view, which displays a small icon and lists details about each file. 
In this view, the icon provides a visual cue about the file type. Although only Details 
view lists all file details, such as the name, date modified, type, and size, you can see 
these details in any other view by selecting a file to display its details in the Details 
pane or by pointing to a file to display a ScreenTip.
In Step-by-Step A.6, you use the Change your view button arrow on the toolbar 
to change the view settings in Windows Explorer.
Step-by-Step A.6
	 1.	 In the Windows Explorer window, click the Change your view button

App-9 
Navigating Folders
To navigate the file system on your computer, you use the Navigation pane in 
Windows Explorer. The Navigation pane organizes resources into the following five 
categories:
n 
Favorites—Locations you access frequently, such as the desktop.
n 
Libraries—The Windows default libraries.
n 
Homegroup—Your shared home network, if any.
n 
Computer—The drives and devices on your computer.
n 
Network—Network locations your computer can access.
When you move the pointer into the Navigation pane, triangles appear next 
to some icons. An open triangle, or expand icon, indicates that a folder contains 
other folders that are not currently displayed in the Navigation pane. Click the 
triangle to expand the folder and display its subfolders. A filled triangle, or col-
lapse icon, indicates the folder is expanded, and its subfolders are listed below the 
folder name.
In Step-by-Step A.7, you insert an empty USB drive into a USB port on your 
computer, and then use Windows Explorer to navigate to that drive, which is 
shown as REMOVABLE (J:) in the following steps. If your USB drive is attached 
to a different drive, substitute its name and drive letter for the remaining steps in 
this appendix.
Step-by-Step A.7
	 1.	 Insert an empty USB drive into a USB port on your computer. If an 
AutoPlay window opens showing options for working with the contents 
of the USB drive, close it so you can use the Navigation pane in the 
Windows Explorer window to navigate to the drive.
	 2.	 If necessary, click the expand icon 
 next to Computer in the Navigation 
pane to display the drives on your computer, including the USB drive.

Managing Files
To manage your files, your first task is often creating folders that will contain the 
files. Next, you can create, copy, and move files into the folders to organize the files 
logically, which makes them easier to find later.
In Step-by-Step A.8, you create two folders on your USB drive, and then use 
WordPad to create and save a short text file in one of the new folders. You can ­create 
a file using the New folder button on the toolbar or the New command on the shortcut 
menu that appears when you right-click a blank area in Windows Explorer. You use 
both methods in the following steps.

Copying, Moving, and Renaming Files
You can copy and move files using a variety of methods. Two easy ways to copy 
and move files are using keyboard shortcuts and using a shortcut menu. In either 
case, you select a file and use the Copy or Cut command to temporarily store the file 
on the Clipboard, and then use the Paste command to insert the file elsewhere. The 
keyboard shortcuts for these commands are as follows:
n 
Copy command: Ctrl+C
n 
Cut command: Ctrl+X
n 
Paste command: Ctrl+V

App-13 
After copying or moving a file, you might want to rename it. To do so, you can 
right-click the file, click Rename on the shortcut menu to select the filename, and 
then type to enter a new name. All of these techniques apply to folders as well—you 
can copy, move, and rename folders using the same keyboard shortcuts and shortcut 
menus.
In Step-by-Step A.9, you copy the Description file to the root directory of your 
USB drive, rename it, and then move it to the Key Terms folder using keyboard 
shortcuts and shortcut menus.
Step-by-Step A.9
	 1.	 Navigate to the Computer Literacy folder to display its contents—the 
Description file.
	 2.	 Click the Description file, and then press the Ctrl+C keys to copy the file 
to the Clipboard.
	 3.	 In the Navigation pane, click REMOVABLE (J:) to display its contents in 
the right pane, and then press the Ctrl+V keys to paste the Description 
file in the root directory of the USB drive.
	 4.	 Right-click the Description file, and then click Rename on the shortcut 
menu to select the filename. Type Comp Lit Definition and then press 
the Enter key to rename the file. See Figure A–11.

Appendix A  Using Windows 7
Deleting Files and Folders
If you are no longer using files or folders, you should delete them so they don’t 
consume disk space unnecessarily. In Windows Explorer, you delete a file or folder 
by deleting its icon. When you delete a file from a hard disk, Windows removes the 
file from the folder but stores the file contents in the Recycle Bin. If you change 
your mind and want to retrieve a file or folder deleted from your hard disk, you can 
use the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop to open the Recycle Bin window, where 
you can recover the file or folder and return it to its original location. However, 
after you empty the Recycle Bin, you can no longer recover the files and folders it 
contained.
The files and folders you created in this appendix were for practice only, so 
you can delete them. In Step-by-Step A.10, you delete the files and folders effi-
ciently by selecting both folders first and then deleting them, which also deletes all 
the files they contain. You can delete files and folders using the Delete command on 
the shortcut menu or using the Delete key.
Step-by-Step A.10
	 1.	 Navigate to the root directory of your USB drive.
	 2.	 Click the Computer Literacy folder, hold down the Shift key, click the 
Key Terms folder, and then release the Shift key. The two folders are 
now selected. See Figure A–12.

Using the Control Panel
To change the way Windows looks and interacts with hardware and other soft-
ware, you use the Control Panel, a window that contains specialized tools for cus-
tomizing Windows. By default, the Control Panel organizes these tools into eight 
categories: System and Security; Network and Internet; Hardware and Sound; 
Programs; User Accounts and Family Safety; Appearance and Personalization; 
Clock, Language, and Region; and Ease of Access. Each category includes links 
to tools you can use to control the settings on your computer, such as its appear-
ance and system time.
In Step-by-Step A.11, you use the Control Panel to explore options for changing 
the desktop theme, a collection of settings including the desktop background, colors 
for screen elements such as window borders, system sounds, and a screen saver.

Windows go to sleep if you do not plan to use your computer for up to a day. If you 
are using a laptop computer, are away from a wall outlet, and are running low on 
battery power, you should shut down Windows instead. If you do not plan to use a 
desktop computer for more than a day, such as over the weekend, you should also 
shut it down to save wear and tear on its components and to prevent damage from an 
electrical storm or power surge.
To shut down the computer, you click the Shut down button on the Start menu. 
To access the other options, click the Shut down arrow button. See Figure A–16.
