Bill Oddie Micronet
To many people, computers and
conversation lie at opposite ends of the
ecological spectrum, but the two were
brought together recently when Bill
Oddie appeared o n  Micronet's
Celebrity ChatLine.
Prince Charles hit the nail on the
head when he said conservationists
need a  more up-to-date image and
events l i ke  th i s interview w i th
Micronet are an excellent example of
how we are using today's technology
to help preserve the environment,' said
Oddie, Vice-President of the British
Trust for Conservation Volunteers.
The main purpose o f  Oddie's
appearance was to promote the Trust's
campaign to plant a million trees. The
devastation of the South East's trees
in last October's gales formed the grim
inspiration for the Trust's initiative
and Oddie took advantage o f the
opportunity to spread the word.
Micronet i s  a l so  ta ki n g  a n
interest in the campaign by running
a competition offering 'tree-inspired'
prizes with all proceeds going to the
BTCV Emergency Tree Fund.
Anyone wishing to help out can
contact the BICV at the address below_
for details o f their Emergency Tree
Pack which gives advice on how to
plant and care for trees in your area.

It takes a  lot to  shatter the calm
composure o f Fleet Street but Grot

Back at the launch, the proceedings
were given an extra touch of class when
the Editor created havoc by stufﬁng
his arm ﬁrmly up the parson's nose

Gutz News
A trip to hospital has inspired a game
by the Special FX  team o f Robert
Tinman and Andy Rixon. Gutz is
based inside the body of an alien and
Rixon got the idea when he underwent
an exploratory barium meal which
resulted in some stimulating pictures
of his inner workings.
The game is a cross between the
Fantastic Voyage and the Biblical tale
of Jonah and the Whale. After being
gobbled up by an alien, the player has
to ﬁnd a way out through the mouth
again. On the way the player is assailed
by lethal gasses and microbes and the
aim is to bump off the aliens organs
one by one before an escape can be
affected.
The game is to  be released by
Ocean Software for E8.95 on cassette
and £12.95 on disk.

Your Amiga
Argus Specialist Publications are
pleased to announce the launch of their
new magazine — Your Amiga.
For several months the magazine
has been incorporated as a separate •
part of Your Commodore but now the
time has come to sever the umbilical
cord and let it enjoy a life its own.
For Amiga owners the pages are
ﬁlled with news, views, facts and
programs galore. A full 72 pages which
will help to unveil the hidden depths
of Commodore's premier computer.
Your Amiga will be available every
second month so don't miss the ﬁrst
issue on May 20th — price f1.50.
Close but...
Red faces and apologies time to Bytes
and Pieces. The review of Helper 128
in the May Issue of Your Commodore
credited the package t o  Financial
Systems Software. True, they do
supply it but Bytes and Pieces were
the actual company who supplied the
review sample.

image for this year with the broadening
of the company into new areas.
'Micronet is the most successful
service of its kind in Europe but that's

John Tomany, managing director of

The restructuring has resulted in the
creation o f  ﬁve  distinct areas:
Micronet, Interbusiness, Value Added

day is Wednesday and on Thursday
for Amiga and Atari users.
The contents of each magazine are
easily accessed from a single index
page and back issues and selected
articles will remain on-line for four

YER Bug Fix
Despite the undoubted quality o f
Precision Software's Script/ Plus
cartridge for the Plus4, some users
have found that it refuses to send more
than the ﬁrst character of a document
to an RS-232 printer. York Electronic
Research have responded to pleas for
help b y producing a  replacement
ROM which ﬁts inside the Plus 4.
In operation, the ROM only affects
the Script/Plus RS-232 output and is
totally invisible to all other software.
The ROM costs E9.99 and an RS-

£34.99, backed by YER's 'guaranteed_

The Power House has concluded a deal
with t h e  Sydney Development

fortunately, only a few of the titles rise
ove mediocrity and even among these,
there is precious little originality

T
-REVENGE OF DOH from Imagine. Even if this
Breakout clone does only offer a few new features,
there is something about it that demands just one more
go. Presentation could be better though. There is no excuse
for not including a redeﬁne keyboard option and a pause
would have been more than useful.
Bargain of the month is again, easily decided. Gremlin's
COLOSSAL COMPILATION offers ten games for just
under a termer. The titles are Auf Wiedersehen Monty,
Thing Bounces Back, Rebounder, Jack the Nipper II. Mask,

Basil the Great Mouse Detective, Convoy, Death Wish III,
Bulldog and the Samurai trilogy.
Bearem-ups continue to provide a source of rich pickings
for authors although there is nothing here that you haven't
seen many times before. SAMURAI WARRIOR from
Firebird is set in mediaeval Japan where not only you go
around hacking people to bits with your sword but you must
also bow to them ﬁrst. ROLLING THUNDER from US
GOLD may be a conversion of one of the best known arcade
games currently around, but it is so mindblowingly numb
it becomes instantly forgetable. PREDATOR from
Activision is a tie-in based on the ﬁlm starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger in which he tries to rescue some diplomats
in the face of a strange alien threat.
It is interesting that most of the people who will buy
this game will not be allowed to see the ﬁlm. There must
be a message there somewhere.
On the more traditional shoorem-up front come two
titles from the US Gold GO label. SIDE ARMS is a one
or two player game, blast the baddies and pick up capsules
which give your ship extra powers. Where have we seen
that before? A free rock tape may or may not persuade
you to investigate. BEDLAM is a vertically scrolling game
Bedlam
and does actually have an original feature (shock horror!).
However, the chances are that you will not be able to guess
what it is. Give in? You get transported into a giant galactic
pin-ball game! Don't be too upset if you didn't get it right.
I've played the game and still can't believe it's true.

stars in his very own game, Big Fat Hairy Deal produced

enough to effect a rescue.

leaping around the various platforms, avoiding being shot
by the multitude of nasties type game. It looks very good
but doesn't play quite so well. VAMPIRE'S EMPIRE from
Magic Bytes is a similar affair although I may have missed
some of the subtleties as instructions were only provided
in French and German. You have to manipulate a beam
of light through the castle by strategically placing mirrors
in the 160 rooms. Again, looks good, plays poorly.
FRIGHTMARE from Cascade is the third o f three
games all looking vaguely similar. You have two aims. One
is to wake up while experiencing the worst dream you can
manage. DEMON STALKERS from Electronic Arts is a
Gauntlet clone that reached number one in the States. It
plays very well although some of the rooms may be a little
tricky in one player mode. I  can't help but feel that it's
been launched about six months too late.
MAGNETRON is Steve Turner's ﬁrst game since joining
Firebird from Hewsons and i r v e r y  difﬁcult to see the
MaRnetron
difference as the resemblance to his old game Paradroid
is uncanny. Grapple with droids to improve your weaponry,
etc, etc. Your eventual aim is to disassemble or shut down
eight reactors. TROLL from Denton Designs certainly looks

0 1 1 1 =M I M EI N
original although closer examination shows it to be little
more than a Q-Bert derivative. You bounce round rocks
avoiding goblins while trying to collect bits of a crystal.
There are holes to be jumped through (although some are
death holes) leading to other chambers. What makes the
game unusual is another set of boulders on the ceiling which
you can spring up to and down from. Your ultimate success
though is likely to depend on how well you can control
a spinning wheel of fortune, achieved by leaping up and
down on short-lived mushrooms.
Very little on the adventure front this month. Apart
from the Infocom game (see elsewhere in this issue), the
only offering to hit my desk is WOLFMAN from CRL.
Wolfman is from the pen of Rod Pike who gave us Dracula
and Frankenstein. The story involves your attempts to
discover more about the reasons your face turns hairy every
time there is a full moon. If you are lucky, you may even
ﬁnd true love at the end of the road. This game is nowhere
near as well-written as its predecessors and is further spoilt
by a series of annoying bugs.
A more sophisticated simulation i s STEAL TH
MISSION from Sub Logic whose games are now going
to be marketed in this country for the ﬁrst time rather
than having to import them. Their original ﬂight simulator
is still the Daddy of them all and it was rumoured that
it was so accurate that i f you could master it, you could
land a light plane in an emergency. Here you get the chance
to ﬂy three different aircraft on a variety of missions -
F-19 Stealth Fighter, F-I4 Tomcat and the X-29. As this
latter aircraft is still only experimental, I can't vouch for
the exact accuracy o f the simulation but I don't expect
too many people will be in a position to contradict.
A somewhat less hazardous mission is a quick session
UPDATE
Card Sharks
of cards, brought to you by Electronic Arts/ Accolade in
CARD SHARKS. You have the option to play Hearts
(better known as Black Maria in this country) pontoon
or three kinds of poker. You can choose from six different
opponents including Maggie, Ronnie or Gorby. The game
lacks the excitement of the real thing and is too easy to
beat. The highlights are some of Ronnies comments such
as I told Nancy that I was at one of 011ie North's shredding
parties!
For those who enjoy putting some thought into their
gaming, SORCEROR LORD from PSS might be just what
they are looking for. A traditional wargame but in a fantasy
. 4 0 1 1 1 1 1 = 1 1 1 = 0 1 6
setting where you can summon demons to your cause should
you happen to be near a rune ring. The game is pretty
crude graphically compared to some o f the icon driven
games currently available but it will prove to be a tough
opponent and experienced wargamers looking fo r
something a bit different should enjoy the challenge.
Electric Dream's CHAMPIONSHIP SPRINT is the
ofﬁcially licensed version of the arcade game. A top down
view of a racing track rather than the normal cockpit view
is presented as you race around one of the eight tracks.
Alternatively, you can design one of your own. The game
comes with a complete range of parameters that you can
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
12
Championship Sprint
tailor to your own requirements, all controlled by a series
of pull-down menus.
POWER AT SEA from Electronic Arts is another naval
simulation (see Strike Fleet elsewhere in this issue) recreating
the battle of Leyte Gulf in the Second World War in which
the Japanese forces launched one last major Kamikaze
attack in an attempt to annihilate the American Navy. The
emphasis with this simulation is very much towards arcade
sequences so if you prefer manning anti-aircraft guns and
launching torpedoes to plotting courses and watching sonar
screens, this could be the one for you.
Last but by no means least this month is Street Sports
BASKETBALL from the US Gold/ Epyx stable. Choose
your team from the local kids and battle it out on one
of four different courts. The attraction of these street sports
is that they include features not normally present in a
professional game. When was the last time you saw one
of the Harlem Globetrotters slip on an oil slick? This series
aims to put the fun back into sport and succeeds admirably.
You may think that I have taken a somewhat jaundiced
view of this month's offerings but I feel that the British
Software Industry is going through something of a bad
patch at the moment. There is very little original thought
about at the moment and when something different does
appear, it is quickly cloned by everybody else. Even though
it saddens me to say it, the Americans are turning out bigger,
better games, beautifully packaged and offering much better
value for money.
Perhaps it is time that we stopped writing cassette based
games and placed a heavier emphasis on disks. We've got
an awful lot of catching up to do.

of disks it can become very
difﬁcult to  remember just
what each program in a disk directory
does. Furthermore, if you SAVE and
scratch a lot o f programs on your
disks, ﬁnding the position o f  the
program that you want in the directory
can be very time consuming. The
program presented here changes all of
that by allowing you to edit your disk
directories.
Basically Directory Editor allows
you to alter the position o f any ﬁle
in a  directory listing, alter the
programs name and enter comments
in the directory. Yes, there have been
programs that allow you to do this
which have been published in the past.

into the directory listing, as does this
one. But, they only allow you to edit
one line at a  time. With Directory
Designer you can 'open up' a number
of lines to be edited and then use the
cursor keys to move around anywhere
within the opened area. This makes
it very easy to position text, or even
to make up pictures using the graphics
on the C64 keyboard.
Using the Program
Once you have a working version of

no problems. Simply LOAD and RUN

saving Basic programs on
disk when they can be easily
stored temporarily in the 64s memory.
This RAM Disk program takes care
of this with the minimum of fuss and
bother.
A simple deﬁnition o f a virtual
machine would go something like this:
"a piece o f  software designed t o
enhance or replace an actual hardware
device performing the same function".
This i s  a  precise R A M  d i s k
description. It is a program designed
to emulate and replace a physical disk
drive by making ordinary computer
RAM act in the same way as a disk
drive would. A program like this, thus
provides th e  user w i th  a  cheap
alternative to investing in a costly, if
not slower disk drive performing a
similar job. The advantage to having
a virtual drive is obvious. For one
thing, tape users can have the same
quality of storage as disk users, but
at a  fraction o f the cost. Another
advantage is speed. Typically a drive
such as a 1541 takes a few seconds
to access a ﬁle and another few seconds
to load it.
Now, imagine a program which
performs that same function, but at
a much higher speed, typically not
more than a few seconds for the entire
access and loading operation, n o
matter how large th e  program!
C64 R E V I E W I I
By Fahiem Wagiet
Program development c a n  b e
dramatically speeded u p  b y
eliminating the time taken by a drive
having to search for a ﬁle, Also the
chance o f  errors creeping i n  are
reduced.
The program I  have written
provides all the above mentioned
advantages together with ease of use.
It works by adding a number of slightly
altered, but well known commands of
Basic and yet, is as good as any similar
commercial product. I have written a
fully intelligent D OS  providing
loading and saving individual ﬁles
from disk ( R A M  d i sk th a t is),
cataloging t h e  d i re cto ry a n d
formatting the disk. It has the ability
to store up to ten ﬁles in memory at
once, though, of course, none of these
can be very large. Currently the DOS
is limited to  using 30Kbytes, which
should be quite enough fo r most
purposes. The DOS steals 8Kbytes
from Basic memory, although this is
by no means a great loss. After all,
who has written a 38K program? This
"stolen" RAM is used by the DOS for
housekeeping, storing and accessing
the d i r e c to r y , a n d  g e n e r a l
maintainence commands as well as the
ﬁrst few Kbytes o f the R AM disk
memory.
All in all, the RAM disk adds six
new commands to Basic, written in the
form o f  a  wedge routine, each

command preceded by an asterisk (*).
The commands are:
• *LOAD"ﬁlename" — this loads a
ﬁle from Ram disk (if it exists) into
Basic program space. If it is used from
program mode (from within another
program), the newly loaded program
begins automatic execution.
• *SAVE"ﬁlename" — saves a  ﬁle
from Basic memory to RAM disk, at

Only Basic programs are handled

if you really wanted to use machine
code you could change the Basic start

and then use one of the new commands
(except o f  course, t h e  * R U N

to do this is situated at SED15. This
routine checks whether the vector
contents are to be copied or restored
and in the process i t overwrites the
RAM at SED30 to SEINE. Therefore
any program residing here becomes

??) by redirecting the NMI vector to
point to a special subroutine of my
own, which when activated, avoids
restoring the default contents o f the
vectors; thus never getting a chance
to overwrite any R A M . Problem
solved!
When using any o f  the new
commands within an I F  T H E N
statement, always be sure that you take
a small precaution. Due to the way
the IF TH EN  statement is structured,
my commands will be executed no
matter what the outcome of the IF part
is. To avoid this happening, use a colon
before any R A M  disk command
immediately following a  TH E N
command, as follows:
10 IF ,tk-1 THEN:*LO AD"PRO G I"
To enter the program, type in the
Basic loader supplied. To activate the
new commands type:
I SYS 32768
You should see a message stating
the program title. When the RAM disk
is initialised, all appropriate Basic
YOUR COMMODORE iune 1988

pointers are lowered to  the correct
locations. Therefore, when ﬁrst
activating the routine, remember to
user a CLR after the SYS statement
to clear any variables that may have
been deﬁned.
And Finally
As you can see, this program provides
most of the facilities of a disk drive,
more so in terms of speed. The only
command that may seem slow is the
*ERASE command, but remember
that it has to do quite a lot of memory
moving everytime it is called. For this
reason t h e  program i s  to ta l l y
incompatible with any program that
uses RAM above 32768 in memory.
The advantage to having a Ram disk
is that you have a fast, reliable method
of temporarily storing data and
programs. It also provides a quick way
of copying multiple programs by
allowing you to store up to I 1 ﬁles
in memory at once and transferring
them to another disk or tape one by
one. I  hope you ﬁnd this program

tankard of foaming ale placed in front of a Bard
is a sureﬁre way to get him to sing. Should you
pay for the ale, there is an excellent chance that
the exploits recalled in his ballads will be your own. That
is of course, assuming that you survive this latest adventure.
The evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta has stolen the Destiny
Wand and broken it into seven pieces. These he has hidden
somewhere within the Realm, protected by hordes of his
evil minions. Not only must you locate and reassemble the
various segments, but also seek out a ﬁnal encounter with
the Archmage himself.
Your party of characters in this role-playing game from
Electronics Arts can either be developed from scratch or
transferred from the original Bard's Tale. Survival in the
Realm does not come easily and many o f your lesser
characters will be lost early on. There is a starter dungeon
for you to practise on but even for that, your party will
need to be approaching twelfth level to stand a chance of
surviving,

There is the usual range of races and professions to
choose from all with a selection of skills although the thief
is probably the least useful character - traps are better
disarmed using magic. At the start of the game, the various
warrior classes will be of the greatest importance as you
progress, magic tends to dominate.
There are a total of 79 spells to choose from although
naturally, you can only select a few to start with. Magicians
come in several classes. You start off as either a magician
or conjuror and can progress up through the ranks to
sorceror, wizard and ﬁnally archmage. Some of the spells
are truly awesome in their power - Mangar's Mallet causes
up to 800 hit points of damage on every single enemy within
90 foot range of you. Needless to say though, the enemy
are using similar tactics on you.
Combat is much the same as in the original game with
the addition of missile combat although oddly enough, this
is limited in range. You can't lire arrows at an enemy 40
feet away. Greater experience brings multiple attacks
although you can't use these on several different opponents.
GAME R E V I E W
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988

Therefore if you inﬂict 23 points of damage on a six point
goblin, your next two hits on the same dead beast are
something of an overkill.
The game has been considerably enlarged on the original.
Now there are six towns to  explore plus a wilderness
containing crypts and castles. One particular hut to search
out is the Sage's Hut. He will relieve you of vast amounts
of your money and in return, give you information which
may or may not be useful to you. There are 25 different
dungeons to be explored, all of which need to be carefully
mapped as secret doors abound and one particular area
missed could well mean the difference between success and
failure. You will also need to ﬁnd the spell point regeneration
areas if your magicians are not to be rendered impotent.
The game itself plays very well and seems to be much
better structured than the original. There are however a
number of minor niggles which spoil an otherwise excellent
game. Equipping characters and transferring items from
one person to another is tedious and badly thought out.
Another problem is that when you save your current
position, the computer is reset and you have to load in
from scratch again -  a continue game surely would not
have been too difﬁcult to include. Similarly, the game can
only be saved in one of the Adventurer's Guilds although
there is one in every city. This has the tendency to prolong
sessions as you have to backtrack through all the dungeons
and reach safety before you can switch off.
These really are minor quibbles though and Bard's Tale
II is still one of the three best role playing systems currently
available. (Ultima and Alternate Reality are the other two.)
An excellent game that will require hundreds o f hours
playing before the world is once more a safe place. G.R.H.

The
N
nearly vanished fro m th e
realm o f  serious computing
but the days of the ﬂoppy disk and
Winchester also look numbered. All
these present day mass storage devices
are based on magnetic material which
is, unfortunately their downfall.
Enormous though the 170K o f
storage available on a CBM64 disk
may seem, it is not really large enough
for th e  masses o f  information
(especially high quality pictorial
information) in common use on many
computers today.
Micros with up to  4Mbytes o f
RAM a r e  becoming relatively
common. Equipping these with a
ﬂoppy disk drive which requires a
handful o f disks and takes several
minutes to ﬁll the micro's memory is
more than a little ludicrous.
Larger and faster permanent
storage is obviously needed. The future
of mass storage currently looks to be
the optical disc which is usually seen
as an audio compact disc.
FUTURES
Goodbye Disk Drives, Hello CD Roms
Even a t the most simple level,
optical means of storing data are more
efﬁcient than the usual magnetic
methods. The density o f data from
optical storage is much greater. You
only have to look at a 35mm slide to
see the kinds of densities possible --
turn the idea around and imagine the
disk space required to store a screen
picture of that resolution.
The density o f  data i n  optical
systems is ﬁnally determined by the
wavelength of light itself (around one
millionth of a metre for the light used).
You can ﬁt an awful lot of wavelengths
into a small area and so ﬁt in a lot
of data.
However, the density of magnetic
storage is limited not by the size of
grains of magnetic material on the tape
or disk (typically a few thousandths
of an inch) but more by the size of
the gap in the record/ playback head.
Even the Japanese, the minaturisation
experts, cannot manage wavelength
sized magnetic heads.
Of course, the practical methods
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
20
Light BrigadeByGeo„.,.
of storing data optically do not come
close to these theoretical densities, but
already they get a  lot closer than
magnetic methods will ever manage.
The potential beneﬁts o f optical
data storage have been known for
some time and i t was in 1967 that
Philips engineers i n  Eindhoven,
Holland came up with the beginnings
of a practical solution_ Their idea was
meant for the storage of video and
audio signals. A  disc covered with
marks detectable by reﬂecting a laser
off the surface would be used. A disc
was chosen as it was easier than a tape
to move at a constant speed and could
be stamped out in mass production.
The Philips invention turned into
the Laserdisc video system. Although
by 1972 Philips had demonstration
machines on show and by 1978 (in the
US) and 1982 ( i n  Europe) th e
commercial machines were launched,
the system could not stand up to the
convenience of video cassette recorders
and it has all but faded into oblivion.
However, the Laserdisc has great
potential, both fo r video and fo r
storage of data.
The system uses tiny pits in the
surface of a I 2in disc to modulate the
reﬂected beam o f light from a laser
shining onto its surface as it revolves.
The pits are only about I  um (a
millionth o f  a  metre) across and
arranged on a spiral track (like an LP)
which makes about 55,000 turns
around the disc, each track only1.5um
away from the next.
All this gives a data density o f
about 25,000 bits per inch -  miles
better than any magnetic media and
giving around ten times the capacity
of any Winchester.
Although the Laserdisc failed
commercially, it served to develop the
considerable mechanical problems of
optical storage. The laser focusing lens
reading the disk must be kept at
exactly the right distance from the disc
surface (within 0.25um) and the beam

must follow the centre of the tracks
to an accuracy of only 0.1um.
However, such mind blowing
accuracies are obtainable and the
money invested i n  Laserdisc
technology has found rich rewards for
Philips and Sony in the CD. It is the
audio CD technology that forms the
base o f a whole new standard o f
computer data storage -  the C D -
ROM.
CD-ROMS are i n  many ways
similar to standard CDs and the old
Laserdisc. They use the same pitted
surface technique for recording the
data but are just I2cm in diameter.
The disc spins to keep a constant speed
(just over I m/ s) of the disc surface past
the read head - so it must turn faster
when the centre is being read (about
500rpm than the outer tracks (around
20Orpm).
The laser beam is focused on the
surface and the reﬂections focused
onto a photodetector which can
register the changes in light level as
the pits spin past the lens. Each change
of light level (the leading or trailing
edge of a pit) represents a binary I
and the ﬂat areas between represent
O's. With pits as small as 0.3um, this
gives data read speeds of 153.6Kbytes/
s - a bit faster than a ﬂoppy disk drive!
The data is encoded to reduce the
effects o f reading errors -  whether
from scratches on the disc surface or
glitches in the system. At these data
speeds it only takes an error rate o r
one in a 100,000 to produce errors
more often than one a second.
The data must also be carefully
identiﬁed to enable accurate random
access to be performed on the disc -
so the computer can read data from
a section of the disc directly, without
reading all before it.
The data is split into frames of 28
8-bit bytes of data, one byte for timing
and eight bytes o f error correction.
Ninety-eight o f  these frames are
collected into a block along with 12
bytes for timing, 288 bytes for further
error detection and four bytes holding
the address of the block for random
access. Each CD-ROM disc holds
276480 blocks - that's over 720M bytes
per disc.
The encoding against e r r o r
detection is very complex and it closely
follows the 'Reed-Soloman' encoding
system used on audio CDs. As well
as deriving checksum bytes for each
frame o f data (as do most digital
cassette and ﬂoppy disk systems) this
also involves interleaving the 28 bytes
FUTURES
of data in each frame to split up any
groups o f bytes affected b y errors
(from, say, a scratch on the disc).
This system can successfully
correct error bursts of up to 450bytes
long (which would be a clearly visible
scratch or mark). Combined with the
additional error correction at block
level (not found on audio CDs) the
CD-ROM system has a  rate o f
uncorrectable errors o f just one in
10,000,000,000,000 -  about one i n
every two years of constant access.
This kind of reliability has meant
the CD-ROM is now taken seriously
as a data storage medium. Mainframe
computers have been using large
optical discs (not unlike the original
Laserdiscs) for some time and now
CD-ROMs are entering the world of
micros.
At the moment CD-ROMs are
available only for IBM PC compatible
machines and general works o f
reference are available on pre-recorded
CD-ROM discs.
Hitachi is the main CD-ROM drive
manufacturer at present. The Hitachi
drive looks much like a disc drive and
it loads a CD-ROM disc just like an
audio CD player.
Microsoft has produced extensions
to the MS-DOS operating system used
on PCs to  accommodate the CD-
ROM drives and these are accessed in
a similar way to a normal ﬂoppy disk
drive.
The ﬁrst commercial generally
available CD-ROM software was
made available recently by Microsoft.
'Bookshelf is a single CD-ROM disc
providing ten reference works fo r
writers using PCs. A  comprehensive
dictionary is stored on the disk along
with a  thesaurus, a  business
information listing, a  literary style
manual and other useful tools fo r
writers.
All this data costs just E225 - not
bad for 1500 ﬂoppy disks worth o f
information available instantly at your
beck and call.
Perhaps the most exciting future
development of such a system is the
incorporation o f speech, music and
adapt all on one disc with complete
computer access and intervention in
their replay.
However, although Microsoft is
currently producing other reference
works on CD-ROM, this is where the
problem with the whole system lies.
CD-ROMs are just like chip ROMs
- they can only be read and not written
to. Once the information is stored on

the disc (by mechanically stamping
them out) i t cannot be altered o r
erased. A CD-Ram would be so much
more useful - a system with the same
speed and capacities but which could
be written to by the computer just like
a ﬂoppy disc or Winchester.
Writable optical storage discs have
been available for about four years.
Used only i n  research and large
mainframes, these use larger 12in
18Gbyte discs with a thin coating of
metal (only 0.05um thick) on the
surface. A s  well as the usual low
powered laser to read the disc a second
more powerful laser is provided which
can melt tiny pits into the metal ﬁlm
surface to form the pits which store
the data.
By modulating the powerful write
laser with the data from the computer,
these discs can be written to  with
whatever data needs to be stored.
A similar system uses organic dyes
on the disc surface. These require less
power from the write laser to alter their
reﬂectivity. I C I  h a v e  recently
announced 'Digital Paper' which uses
such dyes coated onto a ﬂexible base
which can be used in the form of discs
or even tapes with a 2400 foot reel (an
average I2in diameter spool) holding
600Gbytes of data -  enough to store
three complete ﬁlms in digitised form.
The WORM has Turned
However, once the data pits have been
formed in the metal or dye coating on
the disc surface there is no going back.
The surface cannot be re-leveled or re-
coloured and so the data is there for
good. Such systems are called WORM
drives -  Write Once, Read Many
times.
The I  Gbyte capacity o f  a  C D
WORM means that room can usually
be found fo r altered data and the
operating system instructed to ignore
the outdated data on the disk. These
systems are used in large databases for
archive storages.
Truly eraseable optical disks are
still almost exclusively found i n
research labs and two particular types
are attracting the most attention. The
ﬁrst types uses a phenomenon known
as the Kerr effect and a disk coating
of gadolinium-iron-cobalt. Th i s
material has the effect of polarising
light reﬂected from i t i n the same
direction as it is magnetised.
The disk is ﬁrst magnetised and to

The reversal o f  polarised light from
the read laser can then be used to detect
the heated spot. The whole disk may
then be erased of data by heating it
again in a magnetic ﬁeld to produce
an evenly magnetised disk.
The second type of eraseable disc
uses coatings of a tellurium-selenium
alloy o r  gallium antimonide. These

the disc surface, under the control of
the computer. When the spots cool
(almost immediately) they change their
reﬂectivity and so allowing the read

The whole disc can be erased b y

Philips have produced reliable
eraseable discs using the Gallium
antimonide coating which can be
recorded and erased a thousand times
without degradation.
However, with both o f  these
systems, data cannot be overwritten_
These are CD-EPROMs rather than
CD-RAM. Much research is of course
dedicated to ﬁnding a suitable material
to use for CD-RAM. However, the
future for optical storage already looks
set. With units containing several
drives with a total capacity of a couple
of hundred Gbytes, the necessity for
overwriting ceases t o  b e  really
important.
For small systems and even home
computers the CD-ROM will surely
be a commonplace sight before very
long, even before alterability comes
along. The convenience and efﬁciency
of vast quantities of data compactly
and permanently stored and near-
instantly accessible is too great a
temptation for the micro industry to
shy from for much longer. Then, of
course, how about a game of 700Mb

powerful as screen editors go,
anything printed on the screen,
be it listed from memory, or typed can
be entered easily as a Basic program

the line, making sure there's a line
number up front, and pressing Return.
The problems start when the
program lines you wish to edit are not

Lister is a machine code program that
allows you to list a Basic program
stored on disk without having to load
it into memory. This makes it easy to
'steal' lines or subroutines, etc, from
another program, even merge and
append programs.
The program is made up from three
independent routines. The Basic lister
can be used on its own, just use the
syntax:
SYS49152,"ﬁlename
To view the directory, you will need
to type in the directory code. Simply
use the syntax:
SYS49152,"S”
Or:
SYS49410
The ﬁnal part is a wedge program
purely fo r your own convenience,
allowing you to omit the SYS and just
use:
I ."ﬁlename'
While the program is listing, you
can use the space bar to pause; pressing
R UNSTOP will halt the listing leaving
the material on the screen for editing.
Should you try to list a non-Basic

garbage on the screen and you might
be unable to halt the listing. Should

efore the world was created, two universes were
forged together. They were equal but opposite; one
being positive the other negative. On the border of
each Aither (universe) was a nucleus -  Morpheus which
maintained the balance.
Small orbital pods surround the nucleus and keep the
negative, positive charges ﬂowing in harmony. Forever
growing, learning and creating, the nucleus was fast
developing into a thread.
Many time zones have now passed and the threat of
the nucleus has become more apparent. A  commercial
operation is set up to destroy Morpheus before it gets out
of control. If this were to happen the entire universe would
be brought to a halt. The leaders of the universe join forces
to organise a galactic operation recruiting young pilots to
ﬂy state-of-the-art space craft, in a bid to ﬁght for the
universe.
Well, as in most games you are one of the lucky pilots
picked for the mission. To clear space from all nucleus'
and nail Morpheus in a one-to-one ﬁnal battle.
As this is a government project you can not afford to
waste time and money, you have ﬁfty time zones in which
to get to level ﬁfty; failing to do so will result in the game
ending.
If you become bankrupt the research budget into new
weapons and systems for your ship will stop. You need
all the help you can get in the way of these, as progress
is almost impossible without update equipment. So not only
is this a difﬁcult shoot'em-up, there is a fair bit of brainpower
involved too!
To help you locate the orbitals and nucleus there is
a scanner positioned at the top of the screen, (marked as
a cross), this shows you any other nasties. As well as hostile
aliens there are also rocks ﬂoating freely in space, that
weaken your shield.
So now the time has come to show Morpheus who's
boss and blow apart the ﬁrst nucleus. You must shoot just
one orbital, thus creating an imbalance within the two
universes and killing the nucleus easy?
There are 50 levels in this game, each one harder than
the last, and as you progress you will need to buy more
sophisticated weapons from one of the 60 on offer! You
can also build your ship up to a huge craft almost ﬁlling
the screen, but this takes time and money.
As you blast aliens your score is amassed and at the
end of each level, it is transferred into money leaving your
score intact. I f  you have a huge bundle of guineas and
suddenly get napalmed don't worry, it is rounded to the
nearest ﬁgure and carried over to the next game.
Well, that's basically the ins and outs, now to the play.
Presentation is slick with many options available. Options
allow you to save your high score and your game position,
which is very neat.
What about the expensive asking price? Not a kind of
sum the average Granny bashing kid could afford I'm sure,
but the money for the great packaging has to come from
somewhere!
Never-the-less, a great game, but having a Swiss bank
account i s  a  great hel p, please ma ke  cheques

Disk drives come in all shapes and sizes, how do they
measure up?
By Norman Doyle
O
choosing a disk drive for your
Commodore meant the 1541_
Now there are seven to choose from!
Commodore have four - 1541, 1570,
1571, 1581 -  and then there's the
Oceanic, Excellerator + Plus, and Blue
Chip 5.25, For C128 users the choice
is simpler i f full advantage is to be
taken o f the fast loading 128 mode,
only the 1570 or 1571 will do.
Except for the 1581, all o f the
drives offer compatibility with the C64
HARDWARE R E V I E W
5.25 inch disk system but is the saving
offered by non-Commodore drives a
trade off against full compatibility?
What are the pitfalls and beneﬁts?
Commodore 1541
The 1541 is the standard against which
the others are to be judged. Based on
the PET's old 4040 and 2031 system,
the 1541 started life as the 1540 drive
for the VIC-20 computer. With the
YOUR COMMODORE hint 1988
26
launch of the C64, the 1540 was soon
superceded by the 1541 whose major
beneﬁt was a  streamlined case to
match the colour of the C64, a few
small mechanical changes and slightly
improved speed.
A few R OM  problems which
appeared on the 4040 were imported
through the 1540 to the 1541. The main
problem being that the save and
replace facility malfunctions when the
directory ﬁlls an exact number of data
blocks. It's a pity that Commodore

didn't grasp the opportunity to correct
this fault. Even worse, the system still
carries this bug through to the updated
154ID and the new 1570/71 drives.
Any reference to the 1541 is usually
preceded by an adjective such as
sluggish or snail's pace. Most drives
for other computers load with the
speed of a supermarket packer, the
1541 loads like a dock worker on go-
slow. The speed problem is not caused
purely by the electronics system, it is
a restriction created by the physical
constraints of serial loading.
A serial l o a d e r u se s o n e
communication wire so data is fed
hack and forth one bit at a time. I f
Commodore had employed the user
port it would enable a whole byte to
be transferred in parallel, giving an
immediate eight fold speed increase.
Systems such as Evesham Micros
Dolphin DOS fast loader takes
advantage of the user port and the
improvement in speed is unbelievable.
One advantage that Commodore
compatible drives have over others lies
in the fact that they are 'intelligent'.
This means that the DOS is held on
board the drive rather than occupying
memory within the computer itself.
Consequently, th e  drive can b e
programmed and such facilities as
spooling from disk to printer can be
achieved without tyi n g  u p  th e
computer. Th i s  does have th e
HARDWARE R EVIEW
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
27

disadvantage o f  making the drive
larger than normal, b u t th i s i s
principally a result of the inclusion of
the power supply inside the drive's
casing.
The drives are supplied with good
support software but the manual
leaves a lot to be desired. The section
on relative ﬁles in the old 1541 manual
contains an example listing which is
actually incorrect and has caused
problems for users in the past.
Commodore 1570/71
These drives were developed for use
with the Cl28 and, although they work
with the C64, they are not advised as
a substitute unless you're willing to
accept that half of their capabilities will
remain unused.
If you consider the C128 as two
computers within the same shell, the
1570 drive actually contains three
storage/ retrieval systems and the 1571
has four!
Both drives have a fully compatible
1541 system but in 128 mode a special,
faster system clicks into operation
which can also be used for loading CP/
M format disks and, with suitable
software, it will format MS-DOS disks
so that data can be transferred from
Cl28 format to any MS-DOS PC and
back again.
The extra mode in the 1571 arises
because it can use both sides of the
disk for storage without the need for
ﬂipping the disk. C128D machines
have the 1571 drive ﬁtted as standard.
The drive automatically selects
1541 mode when it is ﬁrst turned on
and it's the ﬁrst access by the computer
which decides whether normal mode
will be continued fo r  C64 use o r
whether fast transfer mode is used. The
DOS does allow for the drive to be
locked back into 1541 mode if desired.
The special facilities which permit
MS-DOS and CP/ M disks to be used
relies on an advanced system of disks
commands ca l l e d  b u r s t  m o d e
commands which are also used by
some standard C128 programs to
enable even faster (faster than fast!)
data transfer rates.
Some problems with the 1571
ROM have been discovered which can
cause inconvenience to  users under
certain conditions. Most notably,
serious p ro b l e ms h a v e  b e e n
experienced when two or more ﬁles
are open simultaneously, writing to
side two of the disk is often slow and
spurious DEVICE NOT PRESENT
HARDWARE R E V I E W
errors a r e  generated. A n o th e r
problem, which Commodore cannot
really be blamed for, is when ﬂippy
disks are used.
Normal one-sided disks actually
have recording emulsions on both
sides but only one notch is cut thus
inhibiting use of the second side. As
Commodore point out, ﬂipping the
disk over and cutting an extra notch
has tw o  potential disadvantages.
Mechanically, a felt pad rides on the
normally unused side of the disk and
this can cause friction damage. The
second reason stems from the fact that
some o f the single sided disks are
rejected double sided disks.
The problem with the twin headed
1571 is that it tests each disk to see
if it is formatted on each side and
although it will recognise the difference
between a double sided disk and a
ﬂippy, it is a process which can occupy
the drives interest for quite some time.
A solution does exist fo r this
problem i n  the shape o f  Financial
Systems Software's 1571 Fi x ROM
(f24.95) which cures all of the major
ROM deﬁciencies mentioned here and
a few more besides.
Commodore 1581
This is a departure from the normal
5_25 inch system i n to  the more
professional format of 3.5in disks. The
ﬁrst question that arises is what beneﬁt
does a non-standard system offer that
makes it worth while switching over
when most software houses produce
their disk software on 5.25 disks?
The answer lies in the capacity of
the disk. Although smaller than the
standard size, the new disks are more
rugged and have a  greater storage
capacity. The 5.25 disks has 664 blocks
available but the 3.5 disks have a
capacity of 3160 blocks. In bytes this
means 790K o f  available storage
opposed to  a  mere 166K o n  the
standard system.
For serious business users and
programmers the advantage of such
increased storage space becomes
obvious and the deﬁciency of software
should be relieved with the popularity
of the machine in the States. FSS are
looking towards their own interests by
offering a range of software and 5.25
to 3.5 conversion software.
As a  second drive (with device
number switches!) for professionals I
can recommend the drive and its full
compatibility with both of the Cl28/
64 modes and facilities. 1541 fast disk

utilities will not work with this drive
and using a  cartridge can cause
problems.
Excellerator + Pius FSD-2
This is probably the best known
alternative to the 1541 but will not
emulate the higher capabilities of the
1570/ 1. Although professing total
compatibility with a 1541, the drive
transfers data at a higher rate and is
less th a n  h a l f th e  size o f  the
Commodore machine, but the power
supply is housed separately.
A recent competition hosted by
Evesham Micros offered an Amiga for
anyone who could ﬁnd incompatible
software and, although the results have
not yet been made public, we know
from phone calls to  the ofﬁce that
some examples have been found but
nothing of great signiﬁcance.
This is the problem with varying
from the Commodore brand. I f  the
systems were identical to the 1541, a
court case would probably result so
there is always the faint possibility that
compatibility problems could arise.
The co n stru cti o n  o f  t h e
Excellerator exceeds the 1541 in that
the casing is metal and offers an
excellent shield against electrical and
some magnetic disturbances_
Multiple disk systems have always
been a problem with both the 1541 and
1570/ 71 drives. To use a second drive
its device number must be changed
which means booting up a software
alteration every time the system is
powered u p  o r  by hardwiring an
internal change which immediately
voids the guarantee. Excellerator
avoids this by having two switches
situated under the drive which can
allow any device number from 8 to •
11 to be easily selected.
The main consideration is cost and
the Excellerator offers considerable
value, With a basic cost well below
that of the 1541. Evesham are currently
offering the GEOS system free with
each drive.
Oceanic 0C-118N
The Oceanic drive has a  l o t i n
common with the Excellerator -  an

Peering through the disk slot I could
observe a slight different chassis in the
Oceanic drive, so equipped with a
screwdriver 1 delved deeper.
The internal construction o f the
mechanics of the drives is noticably
different and I  thought that the
Oceanic system looked more resilient
and i t lacked the clacking sounds
characteristic o f  the Excellerator.
Electronically, the circuit boards look
very similar w i th  a  fe w  telling
differences.
There is only one thing that worries
me slightly. I  k n o w  t h a t  t h e
Excellerator + Plus is an improved,
more compatible version o f  the
Excellerator Plus so which version
does the Oceanic drive approximate?
Could it be the earlier Plus? Here my
knowledge gives out neither company
could give me a reliable answer and
looking at the Circuit boards the
Oceanic has a higher code number
than the + Plus. I will continue my
investigations and try to ascertain the
truth. In the meantime I'm afraid that
my answer is that I don't know.
Blue Chip 5.25
Datel's machine is twice the size of the
Excelleratort Oceanic d r i v e  b u t
considerably smaller than the 1541.
The advertising blurb proclaims a
greater compatibility with the C64
than the 1541D, a side swipe at some
of the introduced bugs in the updated
1541 machine.
Blue chip certainly looks as i f it
has more in common with the 1541
than it has with the other drives and
possesses a  more reliable locking
system on the disk slot (the key latch).
With the exception of the 1541, the
drives all have a key latch which must
be swung into position after inserting
a disk. This ensures that the drive
mechanism engages effectively and
prevents the user from wrecking a disk
by pulling it out while the drive is in
use.
One problem I have found with the
Excellerator and Ocean drives is that
the key latch can be swung into
position when the disk is still 0.25
inches from full insertion into the
drive. In a hurry, it is possible to trap
and damage a disk but with the Blue
Chip the disk is only about 0.125
inches out of true and the mechanics
safely pull the disk into position if the
key latch is operated too soon.
HARDWARE R E V I E W
One less attractive feature which
this drive shares with the 1541 is the
inaccessible device number changer. If
something other than device 8  i s
allocated, the drive casing is removed,
a wire or two clipped and then the drive
is reassembled. To undo the change
presents a delicate soldering job which
would have been avoided i f proper
switches had been employed.
Which Drive?
Before discussing which drive is the
best, there i s ro o m t o  mention
Commodore's 1551. This was intended
as an alternative drive for the C16/
Plus4 systems and offered parallel data
transfer with vastly increased speeds.
I've never actually seen one and I can't
ﬁnd records of any being sold but it's
a p i ty  th a t Commodore d i d n 't
investigate this style of machine for the
C128.
Back to the real alternatives. The
Commodore drives offer assured
compatibility with C16/ Plus 4, Cl28
and C64 computers but suffer from
higher prices. All of the other drives
claim faster data transfer than the 1541

but, as the tests show, this did not
appear to be the case. I'd like to see
the results of each company's tests.
Both t h e  Oceanic a n d  t h e
Excellerator offer GEOS in their price
but although the Excellerator is f  10
cheaper i t  does n o t include the
traditional offer of software with the
Oceanic disk. Dimensions have two
offers, a purchaser can choose between
accepting ﬁve adventures plus ﬁve
arcade games or the Easyﬁle Database
and Futur e  Finance Planning
Package.
I can ﬁnd little to choose between
the machines. Fo r C128 users the
choise is limited to 1570/71 /81 but for
C64 owners any of the machines would
do. A s  a  great fan o f  the speedy
Dolphin DOS system my choice would
still be a 1541 and careful searches
through the want-ads can reveal
second hand machines for as little as
E80.
If your decision is based on design
then the Blue Chip offers a classy,
sturdy though slightly bulky ﬁnish but
my favourite is still the Excellerator/
Oceanic drives because o f  their
compactness and external switches.

that things are not as straight
forward as you would like them
to be.
Take for example your average
video recorder. Most people have no
problem operating a video recorder.
because it has a play button for replay.
a record button for recording things
off the telly and a  stop button for
stopping either_
What could be more straight
forward e xce p t for the technically
incompetent, who are worried to press
any button, in case the whole thing
might explode...
But with computers things are
much more complicated. Wi th  a
computer you get a  very confusing
looking keyboard a n d  o n  th a t
keyboard they are no keys marked
"Play" or "Record" or "Stop". Nor is
there a "Start-the-Printer" key.
So how do you operate your disk
drive or datasette or printer?
Flexebility
In previous articles I have frequently
talked about the importance and
advantage of ﬂexibility in computing.
A video recorder, to return to our
example, is so straightforward as i t
only has a limited amount of quite
specialised functions. You want to be
able to record something off your TV
with it. You want to be able to replay
what you have recorded, and so on.
A computer on the other hand is
an extremely versatile data processing
device which you can use for all sorts
of purposes (including running your
video recorder), some quite obvious
tasks, like typing text onto the screen
or sending data to a disk drive for
storage or sending text to a printer,
to get a hardcopy. Also some not quite
so obvious purposes such as operating
a robot!
But how is this ﬂexebility achieved?
It's surprisingly simple. The computer
is given data (input), and then i t is
programmed to  do something with
that data (processing), and the result
of all this is an output of data, and
where this output goes to and what
happens with i t entirely depends on
what you've got connected to  your
computer and to which output device
you want it to go.
In other words, the output of a
databyte " I "  can result in the letter
"A" being printed on the screen or that
letter being printed or stored on a disk.

Or it can result in the arm of robot
being lifted or on a more devasting
note - a nuclear missile being launched
and the nuclear holocaust being
started.
The microprocessor, which I have
identiﬁed at the beginning of this series
as the real computer, doesn't give a
damn about what happens with the
data i t outputs_ It just processes the
data and then sends it on its way, as
programmed. The result is entirely up
to what happens at the other end.
Back to Brass Tacks
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
In previous articles we developed a
simple wordprocessing program. Now
we want to store the textﬁle, which
this program creates onto disk or tape,
retrieve it from disk or tape and, ﬁnally
get our printer to give us a hardcopy
of it,
I've decided to put all this into one
article, because, as you will see, the
operations are surprisingly similar.
This brings me back to what I initially
said.

In terms of output the disk drive
or the tape recorder or the printer are
nothing more than different output
devices. A s  f a r  a s  t h e  6510
microprocessor is concerned they are
no different in any way to the screen
or the memory.
All we do is send the data which
the microprocessor produces, to  a
different stream or channel. And this
is really all there is to it!
Back to our Program
But as always in this series, let me
explain matters further to you with the
help of practical routines. You'll ﬁnd
the listings of those routines at the end
of the magazine.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to show
you two different ways of saving our
textﬁle and loading it back in. That
is, two different ways for all you lucky
owners of disk drives. Because the disk
drive is far more versatile for serious
applications than the tape recorder.
The third and the fourth routine

of you who only get a datasette, but
they can easily be modiﬁed to work
on disk too. The ﬁrst and the second
routine Save File and Load File on
the other hand will work only with a
disk drive. But they are by far the more
versatile as I will explain later.
Save File
The ﬁrst and the second routine are
also very good to illustrate the point
I made at the beginning of this article:
all we really do is send data to  a
different output channel than the usual
or receive data from a different input
channel.
To explain what I mean, let me
give you a very short program which
you can enter in less than a minute
(that is, if you're using my assembler,
Speedy Assembler).
10 ORG 49152
20 LDA 'A
30 .1SR SFFI:02
RTS
All this routine does is load the
ASCII-code of the letter "A" into the
accumulator and then calls one of the
most often used routines in the ROM
of th e  C 6 4  w h i c h  i s  cal l ed
"CH ROUT", which i s short for:
"character out".
This means, t h e  character
contained in the accumulator is sent
to the current output device. And i f
you haven't given any directions to the
contrary, the current output device is
always the screen, In other words, the
character co n ta i n e d  i n  t h e
accumulator is printed on the screen,
and to be precise, at the next print
position.
As you might have guessed by now,
this is the same as if you would give
the BASIC instruction: 'P R IN T
"A" A s  a matter of fact, the BASIC
interpreter uses the above Kemal
routine every t i m e  a  P R I N T
instruction is given.
All we want to do now is send our
data to a  different output device,
namely the disk drive. We want to
print not onto the screen, but onto a
diskette.
And to do this we have to open
the correct output channels. This is
what lines 150-300 in our Save File
routine do.
In lines 170-200 I tell the system
which ﬁlename I want to use and how
long it will be.
First of all I load the length of the
MAC H IN E C O D E P R O G R A MMIN G
ﬁlename into the accumulator. (The
actual length - 8 bytes i s  given at
the end o f  the routine before the
ASCII-codes for the actual ﬁlename.
This is of course not a very ﬂexible
method and I'd like to encourage you
to design a routine which allows the
user to enter a ﬁlename of his own,)
Secondly, I put the low byte of the
start address of the ﬁlename into the
X-register and the high byte into the
Y-register.
Finally, I  call the appropriate
routine i n  th e  Kernal -  called
"SETNAM", which is self-explanatory
- which actually initiates the ﬁlename
I've given.
Next I set the channels I want to
be opened. Then, I load the logical ﬁle
number: in our case three into the
accumulator.
Next, I  load the number o f the
output device. I want to be used, into
the X-register. In our case this is 8,
which is always the device number for
the ﬁrst disk drive. If you want to send
the data to a second or a third disk
drive you have to  give the device
number which that drive has.
Now, I  load the number o f the
secondary address in the Y-register. (If
you are not too sure about all this,
I advise you to consult your disk drive
manual. The purpose of this article is
to show you how things can be done
in machine language. I f  you know
what the BASIC-statement 'OPEN
3,8,1' does, you know what all this is
about, because we are doing exactly
the same thing here!)
In line 250 I call another Kernal
routine -  called SETLFS which
initiates those values. Then I open the
ﬁle whose parameters I have initiated
in lines 170-250.
Finally tell the system that I want
some output to be done. For this I
put the logical ﬁle number, ﬁrst given
in line 220, into the X-register and then
call a routine in the Kernal -  called
"CHKOUT" —  which opens the
proper output channel.
Now the system is set up to send
data to the disk drive instead o f the
screen. The following routine, lines 320-
600 sends the actual data of our textﬁle
to the disk drive. And note that once
more, th i s i s  exactly th e  same
procedure as if I had sent the data to
the screen!
Lines 380-430 i n i ti a te  t h e
beginning of our textﬁle and at the
same time send the low byte and the
high byte of that address to the disk
drive. Therefore I store the start o f
YOUR COMMODORE.: june 1988
loading address onto disk. This is of
course important for later on, when
we want to retrieve the data from disk
- except, if we used "forced loading"
which would load the data to the start
address we would give.
I don't think I'll have to spend
much time to explain lines 450-600 to
you. The working of, what I  call
"OUTLOOP", should be pretty clear
to you by now. "OUTLOOP" simply
sends 1000 bytes - a full screen - to
the disk drive. This is of course not
terribly sophisticated, and I think you
will replace this routine very quickly
with something better. Th a t i s,
something that relates more to our
wordprocessor and saves only the
characters actually written.
One way of doing this is by using
the variable "TEXTFILE" as the limit
for saving.
Another way is by writing a short
routine which puts an end marker
let's say 0 - at the end of the textﬁle.
Then all you have to do is insert the
line "BEQ EXIT" after line 480 and
lines 550-600 can be erased.
Finally I close all the channels I
have opened in lines 170-300. This is
in order to put output back to normal
again - that is to the screen.
First I load the logical ﬁle number
into the accumulator and call a routine
in the Kernal which is called CLOSE.
This closes the output channel.
In fact, I could open a different
output channel now which I  had
initiated beforehand and which might
go, let's say to the printer. Or I could
open an input channel to get data from
a disk which I  then process and the
result of which I send back to the disk
drive, by again opening the output
channel as we did in lines 290-300. This
would be useful fo r a  data base
program, where data is retrieved from
the disk, processed and new data sent
back to the disk to be stored.
But i n  our case we can close
everything and put it back to normal.
This is what line 670 does, which calls
on another Kernal routine, named
CLRCH, which is short fo r 'clear
channels'.
Load File
In the next routine *Load File' we do
the opposite of what we did in our
ﬁrst routine. We retrieve the data we've
stored onto disk.
Lines 190-320 open the appropriate
input channel from the disk drive.

Lines 360-390 get the start address,
we've stored before, from the disk and
initiates the beginning of our textﬁle.
Lines 440-510 get the data itself,
To determine the end of this loop,
I use "ST" which is the socalled status
variable of the C64. This variable is
located at decimal 144 (Hex 90) and
is updated after every input or output
operation. In the case of input from
the disk drive it tells when the end of
the ﬁle has been reached. In this case
ST will contain 64, otherwise it
contains O.
Lines 560-590 close the input
channel and clear all channels, as we
did in the ﬁrst routine.
The rest of the routine reprints the
textile Onto the screen by converting
each byte into its appropriate screen
code and outputting that directly to
screen - as we've done before.
Again, the disadvantage of this
routine is  tha t i t  is  not  very
sophisticated in that it ﬁlls the whole
of the screen, which means that you
will get alot of garbage after your
textﬁle. But I  trust, you've learned
enough by now to write a  better
routine and also tie the whole thing
properly into our wordprocessor. So
that after the textﬁle has been
reprinted, the user can continue
straight away to enter more text.
Tape Save
The third and fourth routine I've
written for all you datasette users out
there. But they can also easily be
modiﬁed for  disk use and thus
demonstrate another, less versatile way
of saving and loading data onto disk.
All you have to do, if you want
to use these routines for disk use, is
change the device number in line 190
and line 210 respectively.
Lines 130.210 in the Tape Save
routine do exactly the same thing as
in the Save File routine. Only that we
set now different logical ﬁles, because
we want to output to the datasette.
We do not need to open or later
on close anything, because we will be
using the Save routine in the Kernal
which will do all that and send the
data on its way.
All we have to do is tell the system
where our textﬁle starts and where it
ends.
The low byte and the high byte of
the start address is loaded into a zero
page location of our choice and then
the number of this zero page location
MAC H IN E C O D E  P R O G R A MMIN G
is loaded into the accumulator to tell
the system which location we've
chosen to point at the beginning of
our textﬁle (lines 250-290).
Next, the low byte of  the end
address of our textﬁle we put into the
X-register and the height byte we put
into the Y-register.
And this is all there is to it. Line
360 calls the actual saving routine in
the Kemal.
Tape Load
The fourth routine again does the
opposite of what we did in the third
routine. Therefore, it  is similarly
structured and needs very little
explanation, except for two points.
The Kernal Load routine is also
used for varifying a ﬁle on disk or tape.
Therefore we have to tell the system,
what we want. If we load a zero into
the accumulator (line 200), it will load
the ﬁle from disk or tape. If, on the
other hand, we put a  one into the
accumulator, the appropriate ﬁle on
disk or tape will be compared with
what is in memory and at the end we
will be told if it veriﬁes or not.
This is done by either setting or
clearing the carry ﬂag, If the carry ﬂag
is clear, it has veriﬁed, if it is set, it
hasn't.
Lines 290-300 simply tell the
system where we want the ﬁle to be
loaded to, if we are using the so-called
forced loading, which loads the ﬁle to
that address and not the one given on
disk or tape.
After I've called the Kernal Load
routine which'does the actual loading
(or verifying), I test the carry ﬂag to
see if an error has occured (line 380).
If carry is set at this point, it can
mean -
hasn't been found on disk or tape or
the loading process ha s  been
interrupted with the break key or -
in the case of varifying -  it doesn't
varify.
In this case we jump straight to the
exit of our routine in line 1230.
Otherwise, if carry is clear, which
means that the ﬁle has been loaded
correctly, we reprint the textﬁle onto
the screen with a similar routine as
used in the Load File routine.
Printer Routine
Sending our textﬁle to the printer, as
we do in our ﬁfth routine, is really
the same as sending it to the screen
YOUR COMMODORE iune 1988
12
or the disk drive or the datasette.
Again, all we are using is a different
output device, namely the printer.
To open the appropriate output
channels we of course don't have to
give a ﬁlename. So we put a zero into
the accumulator, which signiﬁes No
ﬁlename' (lines 170-180),
Lines 200-280 open the appropriate
channels to the printer and need no
further explanation.
Lines 320-360 initiate the start of
our textﬁle.
In line 390 I send a carriage return
to the printer, which is a good idea
at the beginning of  every printer
routine, because it empties the buffer
in the printer of any garbage which
might be left over from the last
printout and positions the print head
at the beginning of a new line.
For this I use a ROM routine which
saves me two bytes. Because I could
do the whole thing like this:
LDA #  13
JSR SAB47
(SAB47 is a  short cut to the
CHROUT routine which we've used
in our "Save File" routine.)
I don't have to explain much about
the main print loop in lines 450-600,
except for one thing.
In lines 460-470 I send a so-called
printer control character to the printer,
and I do this every time before sending
the actual letter to be printed.
This is an instruction to the printer
to do the printing that follows in a
certain speciﬁed way, that is enhanced
or reversed or bold or whatever.
To ﬁnd t he  proper control
character for what you want to do,
you have to consult the manual of your
printer. I've got an Commodore MPS
1000 printer which I use in our routine
in its Commodore mode. And since
I want the text to be printed in lower
and upper case (business mode) I tell
the printer to do so by sending the
control character 17 before each letter
to be printed.
Line 640 sends a  ﬁnal carriage
return to the printer in order to empty
the printer buffer and get the rest of
the textﬁle printed. (Again this routine
is not very sophisticated and will print
some garbage after the actual text,
because 1000 bytes are sent to the
printer. But I am quite sure you will
have enough knowledge by now to
mend this unsatisfactory state of
affairs.)

GAME R E V I E W

ar, far away from the systems of man, at the very
edge of the galaxy, uninhabited planets are colonised
by a race of Insectoids. Because of the  constant attack
from the metallic stormtroopers o f the Arachnoids the
Insectoids protect their colonies with force shields powered
by generators. However, these generators need constant
support to maintain their charge and that's why the elite
force of Rim Runners were formed.
As a Rim Runner you're armed with a pump action
laser riﬂe and supplied with four reptilian mounts, known
as Runners. If one gets shot all you have to do is whistle
and another comes running to replace it. The Runner is
a good stead and will carry you at great speed through
the landscape, but will do nothing to defend itself against
the Arachnoid Attack.
This attack comes in a variety of deadly critters ranging
from ﬁreballs and boulders to  a  bizarre collection o f
chomping and mashing machines. These must be shot using
your laser riﬂe as any collisions will cost either you or the
runners valuable energy. You begin the game with 100 units
of energy and each collision costs you ﬁve units, knocks
you to the ground and costs you valuable time to recover.
The Runner has only six stamina units but only loses them
one at a time. When the last one has gone it collapses
in a heap, dissolves into a skeleton and then disappears.
After a short delay another Runner is at your side and
you're on your way.
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988

Although you can move faster on the Runner you must
dismount to re-energise the spent generators by discharging
your laser riﬂe into them. These look like mushrooms that
hover above the ground and appear as green dashes on
your colony display at the top o f the screen. As the
Arachnoids attack the protective bubbles, the generators
drain and fall to the ground as the dashes ﬂash and then
turn red. Your mission is to maintain these generators for
an allotted time period that also doubles as a bonus. I f
you succeed you're immediately transferred to a new colony
and a tougher mission.
The action is fast and furious as you blast away in six
directions at the attacking Arachnoids, and is played on
a sideways scrolling background and accompanied by
impressive sound effects as lasers ﬁre, generators are
recharged and as either your or the Runner collapse on the
ground. Even the high score table adds to the game as
you punch up your name by shooting the letters.
Rim Runner was designed by Barbarian author Steve
Brown and features the same mixture of great graphics and
addictive gameplay.

Decisive Battles
of the American
Civil  War
W
i
most impressive disk-full o f  code that I've seen
marketed i n  a  long, long, long time (which is
actually a pretty sad comment on the software scene).
The ﬁrst offering, in this country anyway. from the
Australian Strategic Studies Group; this is a package that,
unlike many, lives up to its portentous sounding title. I lere
we have the chance to play through six major battles of the
tragic war between the States, from the ﬁrst encounter at
Bull Run to the vast and complex melee of Chancellorsville.
Six games on one disk would be good value in itself, but
SSG have also been generous t o  include the complete
authoring system, with which all the game scenarios were
produced, on the same disk. They cannot lose by this,
because apart fr om pleasing the public, this  is  battle
scenarios.
First o f  all, let's look at the battles. SSG has gone to
considerable trouble to inject as much realism as possible
into the usual wargame process of shoving icons around the
screen. F or  a start„the opponent's units cannot be seen
unless they are in line of sight with yours, or they are in
territory you have controlled. This sounds unremarkable,
but almost every other computer wargame I have seen makes
the opponent's deployment totally visible, which is about as
unrealistic as you can get.
Next, the company has thought about the whole process
of military command and control as it was practised in the
1860s. Although units can be commended individually, as if
by radio, switching this off means that orders can only be
issued to the troops from your army HQ  via intervening
levels in the hierarchy - corps and division H Q .  Of course
these may be out o f  communication i f  out o f  range o f
mounted messenger, and terrible problems c an ensue
because the wretched corps/division commanders may not
have very good ideas of their own.
In short, the game creates the whole 'fog of war' to which
19th century commanders were subject. Even if you get a
command through. there's no guarantee that a commander,
who may  be impulsive or  cautious, will obey it. A  lot
depends too, on whether they have good staff.
It's deﬁnitely better. however, to play each of the battles
for the ﬁrst time as though each unit had radio, since this
gives you some sort of feeling for the ebb and Bow of the
battle, particularly if, like me, your knowledge of the Civil
War is entirely obtained from reading Gore Vidars Lincoln.
The program frees the player from choosing targets and
ordering retreats in minute detail. Units will to a large extent
look after themselves, so that you are involved largely in
ﬁghting a war of position, just as it should be.

Although Decisive Battles looks a lot better than many
of its rivals, such as SSI's strategy games, unfortunately, like
the SSI offerings, it does betray the fact that it's a conversion
from an Apple II package n o  smooth scrolling or joystick
control, for example. On the other hand, it does use a proper
map based on hexes. Most computer wargames are grid-
based, which doesn't work out quite right.
The documentation for the game is lavish, including a
glossy full-colour map, menu diagrams for the forgetful, and
a 72-page manual. This is particularly necessary if you are to
understand the game generator, which comes in two parts,
Warplan and Warpaint.
Warplan is the most important of the two. With this. you
can design the battle map and set up all the units on both
sides. A very large number of parameters are necessary for
this, but it's a relatively painless process. Maps can be up to
27 x  27 hexes in size, but I couldn't ﬁnd any mention of a
limit on the number of units.
Warpaint is the cosmetic part of the program. With this,
vou can modify the appearance of any of the icons used to
represent terrain, units, or anything else. Terrain can be
redeﬁned with its effect on movement, cover and visibility in
Warplan. In short, the authors have thought of just about
everything. I cannot commend this package too highly.EE

Easy
Basic
Toolkitr'
Tired of Basic V2.0?
Let Easy Basic take some of the
strain out of programming in Basic
By N. Higgins
E
asy Basic is a comprehensive
Basic toolkit package for the
Commodore 64. I t  doesn't
matter if you're just getting started or
you've been at i t for years, there's
something here for everybody. This
allows you to build up a collection of
your favourite subroutines and incor-
porate them easily into the program
you're working on. More on this later.
There are many varied extra
commands fo r Easy Basic which
makes a  HELP function essential.
Typing HELP at any time will produce
a detailed command summary. I
mention this at the beginning in case
you can't be bothered to  read any
further - at least you'll have a rough
idea how to get started.
A note on memory usage. Easy
Basic uses the RAM under the Basic
ROM and the SC000 - SCETE area.
Any Basic program that doesn't use
this RAM should run quite happily
within Easy Basic.
The Basic Toolkit contains many
of the commands n o  programmer
should be without, such as:
C64 U T I L I T Y ' ! "
AUTO (start, step) Th i s i s  th e
command to commence automatic line
numbers. For example: AUTO100.10
will start producing line numbers from
100, and incrementing by 10 each time
you enter a line. To turn off auto-line
numbering, simply press return over
an unused line number.
REN (start,step) This command i s
complementary to Auto, and i t will
quickly renumber part o r all o f  a
program including GOTOs a n d
GOSUBs.
DEL (start,end) This will likewise
delete a  range o f  line numbers.
Omitting the second parameter will
erase everything from the line speciﬁed
by the start parameter onwards.
FIND (text) I f  you should want to
search a  program fo r a  particular
keyword such as PRINT or GOTO etc;
this command will search the Basic
program and report all occurences. If
you should want to ﬁnd an occurence
of a text string such as a message or
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
:37
CUD
M E M
REM statement, enclose the text to
be searched f o r  i n  q u o te s:
1-IND"MAIN MENU"
1
Syntax errors are always cropping
up and so using the SHY command
will list the offending line ready for
re-editing. This also applies to other
errors, including the error which
occurs after pressing RUNSTOP.
VAR will dump all the variable names
and their current values to the screen.
This can be very useful when de-
bugging a large program. The program
must have been RUN before using this
command.
OLD is simply the reverse of NEW.
Typing OLD will restore a program
after you have typed NEW, and very
often even after a cold start (reset).
INFO is used to display the locations
of the vital bits of your program:
• the start of Basic text
• the end of Basic text
• the beginning of variables

• the end of variables
• the beginning of arrays
• the end of arrays
• the beginning of strings
• the end of strings
• the memory used by variables
• the memory used by arrays
• Basic bytes free
NAME"prg name" and DATE"date"
sets the name of your program and
the date. This is particularly useful if
you have several versions of a program
and you want to ﬁnd the most recent
version. Note that the program name
can be up to 14 characters long, the
last two characters are used as preﬁxes
relevant to other commands. The date
needn't follow any particular format,
it needn't even be the date! As long
as it's not longer than 17 characters.
Wouldn't it be useful if the various
bits of a program could be a different
colour when listed? The command is
Colour (line,colour 0-15). The number
refers to the colour you wish that part
of the listing to  be. When listed,
everything after the speciﬁed line will
appear in the speciﬁed colour. It works
by adding a new line containing a
REM statement and some special
characters. Make sure you don't erase
an important program line.
The L IST command has been
augmented, pressing ' @ 'will save you
typing LIST every time, and you can
pause the listing with the spacebar -
any other key re-starts and R1JNSTOP
halts the listing.
Disk users have not been forgotten.
DIR will display the disk directory of
device 8, without over-writing Basic.
Spacebar and RLINSTOP function as
for LIST.
To load a ﬁle from the directory
(no need to type the ﬁle name), simply
cursor up to the relevant entry and type
@ L  before the program name, and
press return. N o  messing about!
Alternatively, P  L"ﬁlename" will
achieve the same result. Note all disk
commands default to device 8.
Saving a program is slightly more
complex. Using P  S on its own will
save your program using the ﬁlename
speciﬁed by the N AME command
(you can check this at any time using
the INFO command). Alternatively,
@ S"ﬁlename" results in the same.
DOS"disk command" can be used to
send a command to your drive, DOS
on its own will read the drive's
error channel. F o r  example,
DOS"RO:JI M=0;FRED"will rename
a program called FRED and call it

APP"ﬁlename" (append) and MER
"ﬁlename" (merge) are very useful for
incorporating pre-written subroutines
in a  p r
Append merely tags the new program
on the end of an existing program in
memory. I t  is highly likely the line
numbers of the appended program will
ﬁt the new program, so use the REN
command to  re-number. Merge is
similar, except that it will replace line
numbers in the original program where
they coincide.
The 64's Basic has no facility for
saving blocks of memory, so the next
couple of commands rectify this.
BSAVE"ﬁlename",8,I,SA,EA will
save the memory to disk between SA
(start address) and EA (end address)
while BLOAD"ﬁlename",8,I,SA will
load a block into memory starting at
SA (start address).

command that saves a  program in

means that when the program is loaded

RUNSTOP key i s disabled thus
preventing prying eyes getting a look
at your work! There are a couple of
restraints here; your program must
start at the normal Basic start (2049),
you must have at least 80 bytes free,
and you musn't have used line O.
The function keys can be set up
to make things easier for you, Easy
Basic automatically deﬁnes th e
function keys in the following way:
I -  moves the cursor 12 rows up
F3 - moves the cursor 12 rows down
F5 - moves the cursor 20 columns left
F6 - moves the cursor 20 columns right
You can set the number of places
the cursor moves using:
HTA B(1-39) and VTAB(1-24)

The shifted function keys are
deﬁned as follows:
F2 p a u s e s  Basic
F4 r e t u r n s  the current cursor
position
F6 m o v e s  the cursor t o  the
bottom left corner o f  the
screen
F8 To g g l e s  quotes mode on/off
N.B.: Don't use F2 to pause
Basic while accessing disk!
If you wish to deﬁne your own
function key assignments, you will ﬁrst
need to SWITCH from preset mode
to user-deﬁned mode. Now you can
use KEIT( I-8rtext" to assign up to
30 characters to  each key. Using
SWITCH again will return you to the
preset assignments.
To dump the contents of memory
on the screen, use the following
commands: DUMPD,SA will dump
memory to the screen in decimal, from
SA (sta rt address) o n w a rd s.
DUMPH,SA s i m i l a r l y  d u m p s

Rom to a printer, you can enter:

If converting Hex to Decimal gives
you grief, DEC(0-65535) will display
the corresponding Hex equivalent
while H EX (0-FEFF) performs the
reciprocal function.
The Subroutine L i b ra ry, a s
mentioned earlier allows you to save
a separate ﬁle containing a list of the
subroutines used in a program. The
name of the library should correspond
to its name on the disk (or tape), to
make for easy loading. You can then
load the subroutine straight from the
library using @L, APP or MER. All
the commands associated with the
subroutine library are preﬁxed with
LIB. To insert a subroutine into the
library, use LIBP•name",start line,end
line. LIB can be used to check what
ﬁles are included in the library, while
LIBD will delete an entry. LIBS will
save the library using the name set with
the N A M E  co mma n d , w h i l e
LIBL"ﬁlename" will load a  library
back.
Even though Easy Basic was
designed with the disk user in mind,
the tape user has not been forgotten.
To change the default device from disk
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
39
(8) to tape (I), you can use DEVICE!.
Likewise, DEVICE8 will re-select the
disk drive.
KILL can be used to  return to
regular 64 mode, and a  tap o f the
RUNSTOP and RESTORE keys will
reactivate Easy Basic.
Getting it all in
Type and save SAVER, EASY BASIC
and LOADER by:
POKE 43,0:POKE44,9:P0KE2303,0:
NEW
Load and run LOADER. Replace
DEVICE in line 43 with 1(Ca) o r
8(Disk). Next, load and run EASY
BASIC, and type NEW. Without
resetting the machine, load SAVER.
Before running, cassette users should
type POKE 40715,1.
Finally run the SAVER program.
This creates the ﬁle called EASY
BASIC V I " ,
To load EASY BASIC, run the
program called EB LOADER. The
ﬁles SAVER, EASY BASIC and
LOADER are no longer needed once
you've tested EASY BASIC.

hero to  be recreated i n  Infocom's classic style.
However, i n  the mystery o f the Crown Jewels,
Sherlock Holmes discovers it is a trap organised by the
evil Professor Moriarty to capture him, so he decides it
is best to let you, D r Watson, take control of the case.
As the game begins you know none o f this as you are
summoned by the loyal Mrs Hudson to help the great man
out of a deep depression. Armed with your C64 and trusty
disk drive you rush to 221 B Baker Street.
Infocom packaging has become a legend in its own
loading time and Sherlock is no exception as the double-
sided game disk is backed up by a full instruction book,
a map of Ye Olde London Towne, a useless but decorative
Sherlock and Watson key ring and a copy of the June
17th, 1887 Thames. This authentic looking paper is packed
full of notices covering everything from births to deaths,
changes of name and new publications as well as the report
on the Cambridge University v Sussex cricket match. All
this adds to the atmosphere but means little as the game
loads and you are lead by Mrs Hudson up to the apartments
of Sherlock Holmes.
As with all Infocom adventures you are faced with a
series of puzzles that must be solved to reach a perfect
score and ﬁnish the game, and I have no intention of spoiling
this process by telling you any solutions. However, if you
SIIERIO
get really stuck you could resort to the cowardly way out
and delve into the on-line 'instruction' for a helping,hand
or an answer. These bring their own problems as you can
spoil the game i f you use them too much and they have
been written to send a casual looker on wild goose chasers!
One thing is certain, you are on your own as although
Holmes trails along he refuses to help, but can clarify some
points and even guides you in the right direction. This is,
perhaps, just as well as Holmes is at his most infuriating
as he immediately pounces on a small item in the newspaper
that you've already read and starts you off on a race against
time to recover the crown jewels.
This trail of mystery and confusion leads you all across
Victorian, fog-bound London (some Americans still think
London is like this!) where you can either walk, which takes
time or call a cab. One of the initial problems you have
to solve is how to avoid calling the enthusiastic but useless
growlers (that always take you to the wrong place) and
hail the more efﬁcient cabs.
Once you've solved that you may get round t o
deciphering the riddles left by the Crown Jewels thief that
GAME R E V I E W
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
42
will lead you to  a  mapping problem and a  series o f
challenges, a rendezvous, a rescue attempt and ﬁnally victory
at the Palace. On route you will have to juggle useful and
useless objects, ﬁnd clues, then work out how to get them
(this isn't always easy) and even solve the odd medical
emergency since, after all, you are supposed to be a Doctor.
The game is populated by the usual blend of humorous
but infuriating characters, such as a librarian that distracts
you with a constant stream of very interesting facts, a bank
guard who is adamant that he can't be bribed and of course,
Holmes.
Sherlock is an excellent game that oozes atmosphere
and quality from its superb text descriptions and compelling
but frustrating plot. Another one for the collection. T . H .

PROGRAMMING
Relativc
Prograrnr
W
up fr o m  th e  ﬁrst p a rt
(February '88) in which the
routines to set up a ﬁle were discussed,
with the FIELD details in two arrays,
FIELDS and FIELD. However, once
the computer is switched off then those
details are lost. So we have to store
these on a ﬁle to be read back whenever
the program is run for that particular
ﬁle. For this we use the good old
sequential ﬁle:
BASIC 3.5 + HOUSEKEEPING
First o f all, we need to create a
unique ﬁlename for the housekeeping
ﬁle which is based on the relative ﬁle
but which will not interfere with it on
the same disk. We put the ﬁlename
NAMES in between HSE. and a row
of full stops, and then take the leftmost
sixteen characters of the whole string,
which w i l l  f o r m  t h e  u n i q u e
housekeeping ﬁlename.
I 200 nIS=LEFTS("11SE."+" " , 1 6 )  I
Then the sequential ﬁle is OPENed
for a write:
210 d o p e n  #  3 , " @
gosub 3610
And write the ﬁrst o f the many
variables we will need to update the
ﬁle after each ﬁle access. We  will
PRINT #  t h e  number of FIELDs
in this particular ﬁle, the Variable C,
and check the error channel.
220 print #  3,c:gosub3610
Then the loop is opened and the
FIELD A N D  FIELDS arrays are
PRINT # 'ed to the File.
230 for a = 0 to c
240 print # 3,FIELDS(a):gosub3610
250 print # 3,FIELD(a): gosub3610
260 nexta
We ensure that the ﬁle is closed
with a  D C L OSE a n d  th e n  w e
RETURN.
330 dclose:gosub3610
.340 return
Other housekeeping variables will
he added to this routine as we progress:
there has to be provision made for
keeping, track o f  the number o f
RECORDs in the ﬁle, those deleted
and so on. Notice the use of the" @ "in
the DOPEN statement. This is the
over-write symbol s o  th a t t h e
housekeeping can be updated on the
ﬁle after accesses have changed the
data. You will also see that in line 280
we have made this a subroutine with
the RETURN command. This is
because this routine may be used for
creating a ﬁle and also updating an
existing ﬁle when leaving the program.
The read housekeeping routine
must be an exact duplicate of the write,
in reverse, as it were, otherwise you
will get data input errors.

The read housekeeping would
obviously only be used for loading the
details of a previously created ﬁle.
After branching to  i t, you would
GOSUB to  the FIE L D  pointers
routine, and then everything would be
set to  Read a n d  Wri te  t o  th e
RECORDS.
Read and Write Records
Since you may well be using the same
program to create many different ﬁles,
you will want the Read and Write
routines to he ﬂexible. You might wish
to have one ﬁle with three FIELDs
and another with twenty i n  each
RECORD so the best method is to
use a similar Loop as to the suggested
PROGRAMMING
FIELD length input routine in the ﬁrst
part.
The a c t u a l  m e t h o d  a n d
presentation on the Data Write into
RECORD is up to you, but I  will
suggest some routines you may ﬁnd
useful. Whichever method you use,
you must ensure that the FIELDS are
the correct length to match the FIELD
pointers already calculated b y  the
program. One suggestion I might make
is the following. We can use the same
loop as the FIELD Input routine used
in the ﬁrst part. First we increment
the RECORD counter, RN, and then
null the collection string. DISKS.
25 10 rn=rn+ I: rem****increment Rec
no
2520 diskS"null the collect string
Then we start the loop and clear
the screen.
2525 for a = 0 to c
2530 print(cIrscreen)
And we display the details relevent
to this particular FIELD
2535 print"Enter FIELD";a+I;
" Subject ";FIELDS(a)
And receive the data with the
INPUT
2540 inputfs$
Now we add the FIELDString to
the collection String DISKS
2550 diskS= diskS + fs$
And continue to collect the next
String until the RECORD is complete.
2560 next a
There, how was that. Will that do?

Learn the correct method
of using relative ﬁles by
following our series.
The second installment deals
with how to write and read
to records on the ﬁle
By Eric Ramsay
Well, no. We have relied on the user
to type the FIELDs in and they can
be of any length, and clearly that.will
not do. The FIELDs must always
begin in exactly the same place in every
RECORD o r  the display o f  the
RECORD will not work. On the other
hand, we could add a carriage return
character, CH RS( I 3) to  the end o f
each FIELD. but the problem there
is that the FIELDs will still be o f
irregular lengths, and what is more,
a separate Read operation would be
necessary for every FIELD rather than
a ma xi mu m o f  t w o  f o r  each
RECORD. So  we have to  add a
padding to ensure that every FIELD
is exactly the right length. This is not
too difﬁcult if we declare a string full
of spaces, call it PADS right at the
beginning of the program:
10 padS="
":padS =padS+ padS:
padS+paarem***paanow=
80 spaces
That should be long enough. Now
we use the length of the FIELD already
contained i n  FIEL D () inside the
routine:
2545 fsS=leftSffsS+padS,FIELD(a))
....and every FIELD as it goes through
the loop would be of exactly the length
stored in the array FIELD°. Now
when the loop has ﬁnished for every
RECORD, the collection String

DISKS would be exactly the same
length and we will be able to split up
each DISKS for display and processing
without several Read operations.
Of course, when writing your own
routine, you might wish to include
details of how many characters are
available i n  each FIEL D  as i t  is
inputted. M y  own programs use a
reverse bar on the screen on which each
character of the FIELD is shown as
it typed and automatically stops
INPUTTing when the FIELD length
is reached. I t  also edits out illegal
characters from the keyboard input to
prevent confusion, but that is really
outside the scope of this article.
So now we have the RECORD
ready for writing in the string DISKS.
We have one more check to make.
Supposing that, on the 64 the length
of the RECORD is greater than 88
characters'? Only 88 characters can be
inputted by a single read from the disk,
which would mean that some of the
RECORD would be missing. Now we
come to the separators again.
BASIC 7 — Collecting the Record
If we were to separate every FIELD
with a carriage return CHRS(I3) then
we would have to read every FIELD
separately, since a READ operation
would stop as soon as it reached the
ﬁrst carriage return character in the
RECORD. This would also mean that
you would lose one byte o f  the
RECORD for every FIELD, which
can be very wasteful i f you were to
have 30 FIELDs. What we must do
(only i f  the RECORD exceeds 88
characters f o r  th e  6 4  a n d  1 6 0
characters for the 128) is to split up
the DISKS at a standard place and
then read the RECORD on either side
of the separator. Before we can write
the string to the RECORD we must
check for the length of the string.
2565 iﬂrec 159thengosub3592:rem
**** special FIELDS
The length of the RECORD. you
remember, is stored in the Variable
LR EC and this line detects if the length
of t h e  R E C OR D  exceeds t h e
maximum permitted in the buffer. The
following routine will now separate the
String DISKS into two parts by a
CH RS(13) so that the RECORD will
be read i n  two parts. The Write
Routine is not affected, and the
FIELD Pointers Routine has already
detected this change in the RECORD
Length. (Refer to part one.)
PROGRAMMING
3591 rem **** special case for I
rec 1 5 9
First the leftmost 159 characters of
the string is put into DIS and a carriage
return, CHRS(13), is added.
3592 DIS=leftS(diskS.159)
chrS(13)
Then whatever is left of DISKS is
put into 1)25, using MIDS.
I
Then both DIS and D25 is added
together and the end result is put back
into D ISKS, which n o w  has a
CHRS(13) in its 160th character.
3595 diskS=d IS+d2S
3596 return
The collection String is now read,
for writing to the RECORD in the
File.
BASIC 2- String Collection
The 64 gives us twice this problem,
since the buffer can only handle a
maximum of 88 characters in a single
read fro m  the disk. Since i t  i s
conceivable that you might have a
RECORD of 254 characters, 254/ 88
is 2.8, meaning that for a full-sized
RECORD yo u  would need tw o
separators.
If at this point you decide to use
a separator for every FIELD I would
understand, since at the beginning I
used this method, and I will give you
the routines you need now. There are
only a few changes, starting with the
FIELD pointers routine:
BASIC 2 -  Field Pointers with Field
Separation
3520 rem * * * *  calculate FIE L D
pointers
3530 lrec=1
3540 for a = 0 to c
3550 Irec = I rec+FIELD(a)
+1:rem *** note extra byte here
3560 fpoi (a+ I )= I rec
3570 next alpol(0)=1
3580 lrec= I rec+ I
3590 return
As you should see an extra byte
is added to LREC at each FIELD, and
of course, there is now no need for
a length of RECORD test, except for
the maximum permitted.

Both of these routines will work
perfectly well, albeit slightly slower in
reading from the disk. The speed of
the writing operation is unaffected
since i n  every case th e  writing
operation i s carried o u t i n  one
operation. This is very satisfactory
bearing in mind that the 1541 and the
1571 actually write much slower than
they read. In case you are stubborn
and you still want to program a full-
length RECORD in the three reads,
here is my suggested solution. 128
owners, avert your gaze. This is why
you paid your extra money!

3598 diskS=d1S+d2S
3599 return
You might have noticed that in
both the above routines, the collection
strings D IS K S  remains to ta l l y
unaffected i f  the total RECORD
length does not exceed the buffer
limitation. This programming may
seem unnecessarily complex, but i t
does save many bytes which are just
wasted in separating FIELDS when
this is not strictly necessary, Owners
of a 128 have a better time than those
on the 64, but still, once the routines
are in place you will not be aware that
they are in fact processing the strings,
apart from a slight decrease in speed.
But why all the hassle? You will see
now why we have gone to so much
trouble to collect all the FIELDs into
one string for writing.
BASIC 3.5 + -Writing the Record
We saw earlier th e  routine fo r
collecting all the FIELDs into one
string, DISKS. This may or may not
contain a separator but whether it does
or not has no effect on the write
operation. First, we have to add a line
to the very beginning o f the input
routine:
2490 re m * * * * *  e n te r records
2500 dopen # 5,(nameS), I ( I rec),d0,u8:
gosub 3610
The relative ﬁle is opened. LREC
is not strictly necessary now since the
ﬁle has been created, you may include
it if you wish. Here I have also shown
two optional statements, the dO is the
drive number, always 0 with 1541 and
1571 drives, and the device number,
U8. if you want to use two drives you
may change the U parameter to nine
in which case the second drive will be
writing the ﬁle., We can now read or
write to any record merely by quoting
the record number. First of all, we will
increment the record counter RN, and
then the next part of the routine is
the FIELD collection routine you saw
earlier:
2510 rn=rni-1:
rem**** increment Rc no
2520 diskS="" n u l l  the collect
String
2525 for a =0 to c
2530 print(cIrscreen)
PRO G RAMMING
2535 print"Enter FIE L D ";a + l ;"

2540 inputfsS
2545 fsS=leftS(fsS
pact$,FIELD(a))
2550 diskS=cliskS+ fsS
2560 next a
Then we have the check for the
RECORD length.
2570 iﬂ rec >  1 59thengosub3592:rern
**** special FIELDS
This is an important part. Here the
program i s assigning a  variable,
WREC, from the record counter RN
before i t  branches t o  th e  write
RECORD routine. This is so that the
same write record routine may be used
by any part of the program. You will
see the importance o f this in later
articles in the series.
2580 wrec=rn:
2590 :
2600 gosub 4080:rem * * * * *  write
record
2630 print"Enter another record (y/
n) r
2640 getkeyyySif yyS = "y" then
2510
2650 dclose
2660 goto menu wherever you place
it
The program branches from the
input routine to  the write record
routine. A t  last w e  are writing
- something to a RECORD!
4070 rem *** write RECORD routine
4080 record ﬂ 5,(wrec),I:gosub 3610
Here the variable WREC gives the
RECORD number required, i n
parenthesis, and the last ,1 o n  the
RECORDS statement i s the byte
number o f the RECORD to begin
writing. This can be any part of the
RECORD, but our write has to be at
the beginning:
4090 record # 5,(wrec),I:gosub 3610
4100 print # 5,diskS:gosub 3610
4110 return
Do you see the simplicity of it?
Because we have gone to the trouble
of collecting the string DISKS together
we can simply declare the RECORD
number and write the single string onto
the RECORD. This is very quick,
especially on the 1571. Even when all
the FIEL D S are separated w i th
CHRS(13) the RECORD can still be
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
written in one operation. The only
difference will come when it needs to
be Read.
BASIC 2 - Record Write
A slight change must be made to the
routine for the 64. The essential details
are there already, but we have to
remember the record pointers routine,
so the write record routine itself will
he different:
2490 r e m  * * * * *  e n te r records
**** ******
2500 open # 5,8,5,nameS:gosub 3610
The relative ﬁle has already been
opened, so even in BASIC 2 the record
length does not need to be speciﬁed.
Now we can use whichever string
collection routine may he required;
either the read in three or the FIELD
separation method:
2510 rn=rn+1 r
increment Rec no
2520 diskS+"" n u l l  the collect

BASIC 2 - Record Write routine
This routine may be used fro m
anywhere in the program, providing
that the variable WRFC is declared
as the desired RECORD number to
access. First we obtain the high and
lo bytes of the record, using the routine
already explained in part I:

4070 rem *  *  64 Write RECORD
routine
4080 rp=rn
4082 gosub4 114 r e m  * a *  get
Record Pointers
Then the record pointers are placed
in position, twice for safety, using the
command channel:
4084 print # 15,"p"+chrS( IOU+
chr$(1o)+chrS(hi):
gosub 3610
4090 print # 15,"p"+chrS(101)+
chrS(10+chrS(hi):
gosub3610
And the collected RECORD string
is written to the RECORD.
4100 print # 5,disk :gosub 3610
4110 return
You will see the usual rule followed
there: the pointers are placed by the
command channel, and the actual data
is read from the RECORD using the
ﬁle OPENed. (You did remember to
open the error channel, didn't you?)
While the re( ard write routine will
always place the DISKS on the
RECORD correctly, you must not try
to mix the different string collection
or FIELD pointers routines. Each of
them, either the three read system or
the FIELD separation technique give
different results for LREC and mixing
the type of string collection will result
in a 51,0VERFLOW IN  RECORD
error. You may check at any time after
the string collection that the whole
program is setting things up correctly,
if you press the RUNSTOP key, and
then type in direct mode:
?diskS
You will then see the RECORD
as it is about to be written on the ﬁle.
Now, test the  LEN gth o f  the
RECORD Collection String. Again in
direct mode, type:
?I en(diskS)
and the result will be a number. This
number should be one or two less than
the Variable LREC, (or even three less
if you are using the BASIC 2 Read
in three method. If it is less than that
then you are wasting ﬁle space and
the FIELD pointers routine is not
working correctly. If len(diskS) is equal
to or greater than ( = >  )  LREC this
will result in an Error 51 when the
program reaches the Write Record
Routine.
Record Read -  BASIC 3.5+ 2 Read
Method
Now we come to the routine which
PROGRAMMING
will read the RECORD, which is not
quite as simple as the write routine.
I have written the routines required
for either the two read method or the
FIELD separated method, whichever
you have decided to use for your own
applications. Be warned however, that
once having decided to use one or the
other, you must stay with that method
throughout the program, using only
those routines which apply.
If you try to mix a two read method
or FIELD separated method then you
will get all sorts of errors and you will
be left with garbage on the screen when
it comes to displaying the RECORDs.
To read the RECORD I  have
assumed that you have OPENed the
ﬁle. Don't forget that once OPENed
a relative ﬁle may equally be read and
written to. I assume for the moment
that you wish to use the two read
method, rather than separating all of
the FIELD& If  so, then the routine
you need is as follows.
You must have declared a variable,
R R FC as the RECORD number you
wish to read, in exactly the same ways
as the WREC in the write routine. In
the next articles I will suggest many
routines to make the display of the
RECORDs in a ﬁle easy and efﬁcient,
but for now I shall use a simple request
for a Read:
2730 print(cirscreen)
2740 input"Which Record t o
Inspecrm
2750 ifn rnthenn=rn r e m  A.**
check for valid no
2760 rrec=n
2770 diskS": gosub 4130
At this point a RECORD number
has been 1NPUTted, checked to make
sure that it exists using the RECORD
used counter, RN, and then the RREC
has been declared. Now we come to
the RECORD read routine. The ﬁle
as already been OPENed so we go
straight to the read.
4120 rem * * * *  read record routine
4130 record 5,(rrec), I :gosub 3610
4140 record # 5,(rrec), I :gosub 3610
The ﬁle pointer has positioned the
read/ write head t o  the  correct
RECORD number. Now the entire
RECORD is INPUTted into the
DISKS.
4150 input # 5,diskS:gosub 3610
But what if the RECORD is greater
than 160 bytes? This means that only
YOUR COMMODORE june 198S
48
the ﬁrst 160 characters of the record
would have been read from the ﬁle,
so we detect the length o f  the
RECORD using LREC:
4152 illrec < I59then return
If LREC shows that the RECORD
is within the limits of the buffer, then
the routine RETURNs. I f  not, it
continues with the second read, which
is why I have called this the two Read
Method. The RECORD pointer now
places the read/write head on the 16Ist
character of the RECORD, since the
160th Character will be a CHRS(13).
It then inputs the rest of the RECORD
into a second, temporary String, dkS
4154 record # 5,(rrec),I61:gosub 3610
4156 record # 5,(rrec),I61:gosub 3610
4158 input # 5,dMgosub 3610
Now the entire RECORD is
contained in the two strings, and they
are simply concatenated, (joined
together) to make the full string. The
CHRS(13) is no longer part -of the
string because it cannot be INPUTted
within a read:
4159 diskS=diskS+dk$
4160 return
BASIC 2  R e c o r d  Number
Acquisition
Using exactly the same routine to
obtain the desired read as above:
2730 print(cIrscreen)
2740 input"Which Record t o
Inspect"
2750 iln >  rnthenn=rn r e m  * * *
check for valid no
2760 rp = n:gosub 4114: rem
*** get Record Pointers
2770 diskS":gosub 4130
except that for BASIC 2 we need
to obtain the RECORD pointers ﬁrst,
in line 2760. The variable RP, as the
chosen RECORD number variable
will then calculate the RECORD
pointers in the 4114 sub-routine. When
it RETURNs from that the pointers
Hi and Lo have been calculated.
BASIC 2 - Record 3 - Read Method
We now have to program our own

version o f  the RECORD R E A D
routine for BASIC 2 and the 88 byte
buffer:
4120 r e m  * * * * R ead R E C OR D
Routine B A S IC  2
4130 print # 15,"p"+chr$(101)+
chrS(lo)+chrS(hi):
gosub 3610
4135 print # 15,"p"+chrS(101)+
chrS(10+chrS(hi):
gosub 3610
4140 input # 5,diskS:gosub 3610
4145 ifIrec < 88then return
Here you will see that there is a
new CURS statement at the end of the
usual pointer lines. This is the offset,
just the same as the last number in
the RECORD #  statement in Basic
7. Since the 88th character is now a
chrS(13), the next character position
from which to be read is 89, hence the
CHRS(89) as the offset:
4130 print # 1 5 ,
ehrS(lo)+chrS(hi)
+ehrS(89): gosub 3610
4135 print # 157p"+chrS(101)+
ehrS(10+chrS(hi)
+ehrS(89): gosub 3610
4140 input # 5,d IS:gosub 3610
If the read operation is over, we
add the two strings together and
RETURN.
4145 illrec # 176thendiskS=diskS+
d IS:return
If not then we read the 3 String:
4150 print # 1 5 ,
LhrS(10)+chrS(hi)
+ehrS(177): gosub 3610
4155 print # 15,"p"+chrS(101)+
chrS(1o)+chr5(hi)
+ehrS(177): gosub 3610
4160 input # 5,d2S:gosub 3610
And then add a l l  the strings
together to make up the whole DiskS.
4165 diskS=diskS+d 1S+
d2$:return
When this routine has RETURNed
into your main program the whole of
the RECORD which you have chosen
to view will be in the collection string,
DISKS. To  see i t you may write
another line:
I 2780 print diskS
and what the program has read will
be displayed. However for processing,
unlike the FIELD separated routine
we need another short routine to Read
the Disk$ into the array. DISPSO.
Here it is:
PROGRAMMING
4170 rem * * * *  read records into
FIELDS
4180 fora=0toc:dispS(a)=
midS(diskS,fpoi (a),
FIELD(a)) :nexta
4190 return
We will be using this routine
extensively in the next of the series.
In the next article I will show how
to program the RECORD display
routines. But before we leave this
subject, we have to  program the
FIELDS separated method for those
who decided against the two or three
read method.
BASIC 7 - Fields Separated
If you have decided to use the FIELD
separation method o f  writing the
RECORD, you will need a different
type of READ routine altogether. This
is a loop; the same loop we saw earlier,
but inside a RECORD read routine.
Why is this necessary? Well, each of
the FIELDS on the RECORD now
have a CH R$( 13) after it, meaning that
a read operation starting from Byte
I o f the RECORD would only read
as far as the end of the ﬁrst FIELD.
What we have to do is loop the
read routine so that it returns to the
RECORD to read from the 1st byte
of the RECORD. This is why the
FIELD POINTER routine has to be
different; i t has to allow the extra
character represented b y  t h e
CHRS(13) to  the Pointer fo r each
FIELD. In actual fact, the routine is
quite simple:
4120 rem * * * *  BASIC 3.5 FIELD
Separate Read RECORD
4125 diskS="":for a = 0 to c
4130 record # 5,(rrec),(fpoi(a)):gosub
3610
4135 record # 5,(rrec),(fpoi(a)):gosub
3610
4140 input # 5,dispS(a):gosub 3610
4150 next a
4155 return
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
49
I am sure this routine is clear to
you, but in case it isn't Il l  explain it.
Line 4125 nulls the collection string
ready to begin and begins the familiar
FIELD Loop. Then the RECORD #
statements not only select the correct
RECORD but also selects the position
from which to  read i t, which i s
contained i n  the FIEL D  pointers
array, FP010. The FIELD data is read
into the array DISPSO. For this reason
you will need to DIMension this array
in a suitable line at the beginning of
the program:
10 dim dispS(c)
or you will get a program error 'BAD
SUBSCRIPT ERROR' which would
not show itself until you selected more
than II (0-10) FIELDS.
Additionally, you are now not able to
display the RECORD using the
statement PRINT DISKS: you have
to use a Loop:
fora=0tocrprint dispS(a)nexta
instead. Much more to  come on
Display Routines next in the series.
BASIC 2  -  Field Separation Read
Routine
The general rules of the BASIC 2 Field
Separation Read technique is very
similar. In  fact, you should actually
be able to work this out for yourself,
but i n  case yo u  are n o t ye t a
programmer, here it is:
4120 rein ****1-1FLD Separate Read
RECORD Routine -
BASIC2
4125 fora=0toc
4130 print # 15,"p"+chrS(101)+
chr$(1o)+chrS(hi)+chrS (fpoi(a)): gosub
3610
4135 print # 15,"p"+chrS(101)+
chrS(1o)+chrS(hi)+chrS(fpoi(a)):gosub
3610
4140 input # 5,dispS(a):gosub 3610
4150 next a
4155 return
In the next of the series, 1 will give
you routines to enable your programs
to display, amend and print the
RECORDs, a l l  inside a  browse
RECORDS mode. Still to come in the
series is possibly the most fascinating
aspect o f  relative ﬁling -  sorting,
deleting and searching.

Strike
Fleet
GAME R E V I E W
S
of a taskforce sent to patrol new warzones of the
world. A t  your command you organise frigates,
battleships and cruisers armed with the latest missiles and
defences as you recreate the battles of the Falklands War,
actions in the dangerous waters of the Persian Gulf and
the global warfare at the outbreak of World War III.
In all, ten scenarios are included on the double-sided
game disk which is crammed into the disk box along with
a 55 page instruction manual/ know your enemy/ and
scenario guide that takes you from single ship patrols in
the Persian Gulf, through combined ship and helicopter
sub hunts in the Falklands to full scale 16 ship battles in
the Atlantic.
Once the game has loaded you are presented with a
screen through which you can select one of these scenarios,
or enter a campaign game that takes you through the last
four WWII! scenarios with the survivors of one mission
forming the ﬂeet for the next! Since those missions are
only for Commanders with steel nerves and lightening
reactions we'll go on patrol in the Persian Gulf with the
mission of escorting a convoy of tankers out of the Gulf.
The next screen, the shipyard, is where you select your
forces for the mission by spending points on different classes
of ship. For example, a Pegasus missile hydrofoil will cost
four points, a quarter of the cost of a Kid Class battleship
armed with missiles, torpedoes, defence systems and two
helicopters. Once you've chosen the ships of your command
it's time to sail into battle.
During the battle or patrol that follows you will use
two screens that are loaded in separately from disk which
unfortunately, can cause an annoying halt to the action.
The ﬁrst screen you'll meet is the Commander in Chief
(CIC) screen which consists of a map of the battle area
and menus to issue general orders to the ﬂeet such as
destination, speed and alert status. Once these are set you
can swap to the bridge of the ﬂagship and have direct control
over the navigation and weapons systems.
Anyone who's played EA's Pegasus will immediately
recognise the bridge screen with its joystick or keyboard
accessed controls to set the ships speed and direction, display
the radar and sonar readings and launch missiles, ﬁre deck
cannons and activate chaff launchers.
The rest of the task force follow the ﬂagships lead, course
and speed but you must command them directly i f you
want to ﬁre their weapons by swapping to their bridge.
This is done by simply pressing the "C" key with repeated
presses cycling through your entire ﬂeet. Even though any
tankers you may be escorting have no weapons and must

be protected by the other parts of your ﬂeet, you must keep
a cheek on the bridge of these vessels as you don't want
your heroic efforts to ﬁght off enemy planes, ships and
submarines to go to waste because you run aground through
poor navigation!
Commanding a task force is a demanding business and
to be successful you must know what to expect from your
enemy and use your ship's abilities to maximise the defence.
If you're expecting any submarines you must keep a regular
watch on the sonar screens as a single bleep could mean
big trouble.
Anybody, whose played Silent Service or Up Periscope
will know the damage a single sub can do to a convoy.
The best defence against submarines is to destroy them
before they get too close, and the best way to do this is
to send out your helicopters that are equipped with sonar
to ﬁnd the subs and torpedoes to destroy them.
Unfortunately, only one scenario is just a sub hunt and
SO you have to watch the skies for attacking aircraft, and
the seas for enemy ships and even the shore line foi
land based missiles. Unless you've got regular helicopter
patrols in the right place at the right time, the ﬁrst you'll
know of an attack will be a missile heading towards you!
This is the ﬁrst threat and must be countered with air
to air missiles or deﬂected with chaff launchers. Then you
must search out the source o f the attack and respond,
otherwise you'll be buried in a constant barriage of missiles.
As the enemy gets closer your reactions will have to be
quicker, to take out all approaching dangers while shooting
it out with the enemy gun boats that are now in cannon
range. Now, at last you can switch off the computer guidance
systems and aim the cannons through a joystick controlled
sight and sink the enemy through your own skill which
is often more accurate than the ships computers.
As the battle rages your ﬂeet may suffer damage when
you will lose crucial weapon systems and even entire ships.
Now, only decisive actions will save the day. The way you
react in these tight situations will determine whether you'll
make a Strike Fleet Commander or end up as a Deck
M opper.
Strike Fleet is an incredibly tense game in which you'll
suddenly be thrown into a frantic battle with only a few
seconds war ning. I t ' s  N av al mis s ile c ombat a t  its

t last! An opportunity to put
your 1571 through its paces.
Super Disk Utilities (SDU
from now on!) is a  menu driven
package for the 128 (in 80 column
mode) and 1571 drive and aimed at
the serious disk user. Although if you
want to get to grips with the inner
workings o f  yo u r drive, yo u 'l l
probably ﬁnd this package invaluable.
All the utilities will work with o r
without a second drive, and some will
even work with a  1541! A  little
experimentation will show how!
Super 81 Utilities is basically the
same p a c k a g e  w i t h  s e v e r a l
enhancements for use with the new
Commodore 1581 (3 1/2') drive. Those
of you not familiar with MS-DOS and
Cl PM disk formats are unlikely to
have come across partitioning before.
Partitioning enables you to  set up
reserved areas and sub-directories
within a disk -  a little like windows.
Setting u p  and controlling these
partitions is worthy of a book at least,
so Super 81 Utilities will be of immense
use here. The Super 81 Utilities come
on both 5 1/2" and 3 1/2" disks, leaving
you with the option o f booting the
program from either 1571 o r  1571
drives. Aside from these. Super 81
utilities is virtually indentical to Super
Disk Utilities.
There seems to be little around to
compare this package to (apart from
Big Blue Reader, reviewed in our April
'88 issue), so you'll have to judge i f
on its own merits. On the surface,
things look very slick - an observation
afﬁrmed b y  m o r e  i n t i m a t e
examination. T h e  m a i n  m e n u
naturally offers selection of the type
of operation you wish to  perform,
namely disk and ﬁle copying facilities,
CP/ M utilities, disk editor, DOS
utilities, drive monitor and R A M
editor. B y  selecting one o f  these
options w i l l  d ro p  yo u  i n to  th e
appropriate local menu.
A word on screen layout would
seem appropriate here , The top line
displays the selected source and
destination drive numbers, as well as
the menu title so you know where you
are, while the next line displays
prompts and messages and the bottom
line displays drive status and current
disk format. The screen centre is used
as a general display area, depending
on the particular utility in use. Let's
look at the various parts.
Disk Copy: a multi-pass disk copier,
with a novel feature which allows the
C128 U T IL IT IE S
Stretch your 128 drives to the limit
transfer of data between 1571 and t
disks. It's not a nibbler, so will not
copy your protected disks, it will come
in handy for preparing backups, etc;
essential, prior to  using the sector
editor.
File Copy: copies individual ﬁles
(CBM format only) to another disk.
Up t o  5 0  ﬁles ca n  b e  copied
consecutively, with the buffer holding
about 220 sectors at a time. A t the
outset, t h e  source directory i s
displayed and the ﬁles to be copied
are marked.
Both the copy utilities read the
source disk fast enough, but it does
seem slow when it comes to writing.
CP/M Utilities: probably the most
useful part of the package. SDU allows
you to examine the format of CP/ M
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988

and MS-DOS, and format MFM and
GCR di sks i n  j u s t about any
conﬁguration, Epson, Osborne, IBM
and Kaypro formats are all recognised.
Also, you can format GCR disks for
use with CP/ M+ on the 128.
DOS Utilities: all the usual CBM DOS
commands (new, scratch, validate, etc)
are easily accessed from this section,
together with a  few 'specials'. The
'Trash a Track' option allows you to
create your own copy-protected disks,
'bulk Erase' will wipe a complete disk
- this might seem a bit useless, but
you can use this option to remove
errors that resist normal formatting,
rather than throwing the disk!
Disk Editor: be warned - this section
is not for the faint-hearted; valuable
data can be irrevocably lost at the

touch of a key - use the Disk Copy
utility to backup ﬁrst! Having got that
out of the way, this is a pretty powerful
sector editor for GCR (CBM) format
disks. Using the disk editor, you can
pull a sector from a disk onto the
screen and edit either in Hex or in
ASCII before sending the updated
sector back to the disk.
I mu st sa y I'v e  seen mo re
sophisticated sector editors fo r the
C64/ 1541 (check the directory editor
published in Commodore Disk User
- Nov/Dec '87), although that doesn't
necessarily mean there's anything
wrong with this one. The disk editor
can be used to edit directory ﬁlenames,
repair corrupted ﬁles, or just customise
system messages (this can be great
fun).
Drive Monitor this works the same
way as the disk editor, but on the
drive's memory. The internal workings
of your drive no longer need be a
mystery. Every nook and cranny is
available fo r your scrutiny -  both
RAM and ROM. Memory can be
examined and edited (Hex or ASCII)
a page at a time, with all the useful
information in front o f you. Need I
say the page is automatically loaded
into the 128's RAM, you can use the
M/C monitor to disassemble.
'71 Writer: this is complementary to
the Drive Monitor section and you can
ﬂip between Drive Monitor and '71
Writer without going back through the
main menu. 71 Wri te r lets yo u
assemble code using the I28's M /C
monitor and write i t to the drive's
memory. Th i s  i s  probably n o t
something you'll want to do very often,
but if your really want to explore the
many hidden features of the 1571, this
section is vital.
Having looked at what SDU has
to offer, I can begin to describe what
it's like to use. I ran into a couple of
minor bugs while testing the package
and although there's no excuse for
bugs i n  commercial software, they
don't interfere with things too much.
For example - selecting 'Disassemble'
from the 'Drive Monitor' section drops
you back to the drive monitor again.
You can only disassemble through the
I 28's M/C  monitor, so you need to
enter the M/C monitor ﬁrst,

YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
There are occasions when the drive
can't read a  disk, but keep trying
anyway - the only way out is to power
down and reboot. The manual leaves
something to be desired, too. Although
there's a  print option on the Disk
Editor, Drive Monitor and '71 Writer
don't permit disassembly to printer.
However, it's a simple matter to drop
into Basic from the M C monitor and
re-enter after typing OPEN4,4 and
CMD4:MONITOR.
All disassembly will now be sent
to printer, not the screen, As this is
such an important operation, I feel this
should have been at least mentioned
in the manual, if not included in the
program! I would also liked to have
seen a recommended reading list for
those of you who wish to go deeper
into disks and drives.

powerful sector editor for use
with the C64 and 1541 disk
drive, It's very compact in size, yet has
all the commands required of such a
utility, combined with ease of use and
a cl ear easy-to-follow display.
Although intended fo r experienced
disk users, its simplicity makes it ideal
for those who wish to learn more about
how the Commodore DOS stores ﬁles,
and allows simple editing of text ﬁles
by merely typing over the display.
Command Details
READ T/S : Selecting this option
causes the cursor to appear beneath
the track indicator. A two digit input
in Hex is expected, however i f the
current display is correct then a return
will input the value shown. Cursor
controls may be used to edit but delete
is not available. The same chain o f
events is repeated fo r  the sector
number and assuming that the values
are legal, the requested sector i s
displayed on the screen in the current
display mode (Hex or ASCII).
Write T/S: This command will display
a moving message near the base of the
screen, requesting conﬁrmation of the
write command. Upon receiving the
correct key press the displayed sector
is written to the disk. If any other key
is depressed then the write routine is
terminated and the program awaits a
further command.
NEXT T/S: This command causes the
next sector in the ﬁle to be displayed
in the same mode as the current one.
If the sector on display is the last in
the ﬁle, i.e. it has no valid co-ordinates
in bytes I and 2, then the key press
is ignored.
LAST T/S: This command may only
be used if a ﬁle has been followed with
the NEXT TIS command, and will

ASCII/HEX: When this command is
selected the display mode is reversed,
i.e. if display is in ASCII it is changed
to Hex and if in Hex then it changes
to ASCII.
PRINT T/S: This command causes
the screen display to be output to a
printer (device 4). Both display modes
are catered for. For clarity, columns
are separated by semi-colons.
EDIT T/S: This command allows full
editing o f the sector on display, in
either mode. Display mode may not
be changed during edit, delete clear

mode, press RETURN.
ERROR C H N :  Th i s  command

The result is displayed beneath the
sector display. Any key will erase the
status display and await the next
command.
TRACE FILE: When this command
is selected, the program requests an

input, to determine the output device
(screen or printer). This is displayed
on the same line as the status display,
and expects a response of P or S. If
a valid response is input then the start
sector is requested and all remaining
sectors in the ﬁle are listed. I f  the
display is to the screen then a key press
is required to return to the normal
display.
ABORT: Th i s k e y  initiates a n
interrupt driven cold start and is
intended for emergency use only.
Getting it all in
Sector Editor is presented as a Basic
program. This should be typed in using
our Syntax checker, see LISTINGS
for more details.
The Sector Editor program is
actually written in machine code, the
Basic Loader just being used to POKE
the necessary code into memory.
Once POKEd into memory the
program resides fro m $C000 to
SCAEE (49152 t o  51950). The
program is started with a SYS call of
49469 (SC13D). Memory from SCE00
to WEFT (C52736 to 53247) is also
used by the program.

a speciﬁc program is a work o f art
never mind the amount of time it takes
to go through the 20 or so 'I know
it's on a disk with no label' ﬂoppies.
Or rather that was the case until
I got my hands on SuperCat, a disk
catalogue system.
There have been many disk cata-
logue programs in the past, we have
even published some in this maga7ine.
Personally, I've quite often found that
they did not do everything that I
required or were a little difﬁcult to use.
If you are in the same boat then
SuperCat is the program that you have
been waiting for.
Getting Started
To use SuperCat to its full capability
you need the program disk plus two
blank ones. One of these becomes the
Master Directory Disk (MDD from
now on), where information on each
disk i s stored. Th e  second disk
becomes the CatSort disk, where an
alphabetic list of all the programs is
stored. Up to 640 disks or 5000 titles
can be stored, this should he enough
for j u st a b o u t everyone's d i sk
collection.
When you ﬁrst start SuperCat
there are four main sections, which I
will deal with in further detail later
on. These are:
•Master Directory Builder
• Utilities
•Catalog Sort
• Print Routines
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
60
One other point worth mentionin
before I expand on the above is tha
the program makes extensive use o
dates. Each time you start the program
you must enter the date, this date is
written to your MDD so that you have
a permanent record of when you last
used the program as well as being able
to keep all of your disks in date order
on the master directory disk.
Master Directory Builder
This is the section of the program that
allows you to input disks. Before you
can do this for the ﬁrst time you must
set a number of defaults so that the
SuperCat program knows a bit about
the computer set-up that you are using.
Options exist for using one 154
drive, two 1541 drives or a dual dis
system. If you have more than one disk
drive the amount of disk swapping tha
you have to perform is much less.
Each disk in the master direct°
is given a  number by which i t is
referred. In  the set-up options yo
have the option of writing this numbe
to each disk that you catalog. Thi
allows SuperCat to realise that a dis
has already been cataloged stoppin
you from cataloging a disk more tha
once. There is only one problem if yo
select this option - some commerei
disks use protection systems so tha
the program will no longer work i f
write the disk number onto that disk
My answer to this problem was to
up two disk catalogs -  one for m
own unprotected disk e  other lo

my commercial software.
The last option in set-up is telling
the program what sort of printer you
are using. Only printers that use the
normal Commodore serial port are
supported.
Once you have the defaults set up
getting information about your disks
into the catalog is a breeze. Simply
place the disk in the drive and wait
for the directory t o  load once
prompted. As soon as the directory is
ﬁnished the disk contents will be
displayed on screen, the format of the
display being reminiscent of a few ﬁle
copiers. It's up to you to select exactly
which titles you place on the MDD,
after all if you have a program called
Disk Editor and i t  has two more
sections called Tart I 'and Tart 2' you
only want to put the actual program
title Onto the M DD.
Various options are available at
this stage including the ability to
change the name of the disk in the
drive, you can write the new name to
the disk. You can change the name
of a ﬁle but this is only changed within
SuperCat, i t is not written to  the
original disk.
Once you have a number of disks
entered on the MDD you can start to
use the real power of SuperCat. Within
the directory builder you have the
option to list on the screen the contents
of any disk simply by entering the disk
number, this number is either assigned
by you when you save the disk contents
to the M D D  o r  let the computer
choose a free number for you. The only
problem that you now have is remem-
bering which disk has which disk
number, SuperCat will make this easy
through its various print options.

Selecting this option gives you facilities
for updating the master directory. This
is the same as entering a disk to the
master directory mentioned above,
however, the information comes from
the MDD not from the original disk.
Once you have the selected disk on
screen you can change the name of
ﬁles, delete them and even enter new
ﬁles by hand, the quickest way o f
keeping your disk library up to date.
This section of the program also
gives you the ability to search the
CatSort Disk. As already mentioned
-this is a disk, created from one of the
menu options, that contains an alpha-
betical list of all ﬁles on the MDD.
To search this disk simply enter a
search string when prompted and wait
for a list of the disks containing that
program to appear. You can even enter
wild cards. Fo r  example entering
DISK* as the search string will cause
a list o f all - the disks containing a
program that starts with the name
DISK to appear on the screen. Note,
only the disk number and matching
ﬁlename appears on screen, not the list
of all the ﬁles on each disk.
This is where you create the CatSort
disk. Each time that you have updated
the M D D  this disk needs to  be
recreated from scratch so that the ﬁle
contents are up to date.
Creating this disk can take some
time as well as a large amount of disk
swapping, unless you have more than
one drive. You may therefore want to

recreate this disk only when you have
entered a signiﬁcant number of new
disks into the master directory.
There are numerous options fo r
printing out reports. Should you have
a 'basic' printer that doesn't support

subscripts, etc., you will probably only
use the print options within the
program. I f  however, you have a
printer that is capable of special print
functions such as an Epson or a Star
then you will be able to use separate
print programs outside SuperCat to
enable you to get more information
on each printed page or label. It is
important to note that if you do want
to use the external print ﬁles then you
will have to alter the listing programs
yourself so that they suit your printer.
The programs are well documented
and anyone armed with a  small
knowledge of Basic and their printer
manual should have no problems.
The difference between using the
internal print options and the external
onces become apparent when you
realise that you can get a list of 375
titles per page using the condensed
print of the external ﬁles rather than
just 165 for the standard print version.
All of the print options should be self-

C64 REVIEW
G A  OWNERS, Connect your MPS803 DIRECTLY
to your AMIGA. All the facilities of Printkit IV on your
AMIGA. Don't buy an expensive new printerjustsend forthe
AMIGA version of Printkit IV at just £39.95 plus f14.95 for
the lead (you'll need a new lead anyway).
[f15 discount to Printkit IV owners].
We also stock top quality tractor feeds for the MPS803 with
acoustic hoods, available now £33.45.
*Print list of disks in numerical order.
• Print disk numbers not used.
• Print disks in date order.
*Print alphabetical program names.
• Print disk headers i n  numerical
order.
• Print a lable with message this disk
belongs to...'
• Print one label with six program titles
on it.
• Print as many labels for a disk as
required to print all titles.
If you use the external print ﬁles
then you can get up to 30 program
titles on each disk label; the option
that I have used to print labels for all
of my disks. I only found a couple of
disks that I had more than 30 titles
for.
All labels have details about the
disk name, ID, date it was cataloged
and the disk number.
Final Thoughts
Since starting to  use SuperCat my
relationship with my disk drive has
changed dramatically. No longer do
PRINTKIT IV
AT LAST!
THE MPS803
WE'VE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE!
S O U N D SAMPLER
A NEW BREAKTHROUGH!
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
62
I overwork it trying to ﬁnd a disk that
contains a program that I'm sure was
called 'XXZYZ'. Now all I have to do
is look at my alphabetic listing of ﬁle
names and go straight to the disk I
want.
The disk is easy to ﬁnd as it has
a neat label on it with the disk number
and the names of the ﬁles on it.
Some people may be put off using
a system such as SuperCat because of
the amount of time taken to set it up
to start with. Don't be, it only took
me a single Saturday afternoon of on
and o ff disk cataloging to input all
of my 300+ disks and it certainly was
worth it.
In my opinion all Commodore disk
drives should go on strike until their
owners buy them a  copy o f  this
program!

Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R.
U and N. You press REFURN. sit back and nothing happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you. you can usually
guarantee that at least one little bug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodtwe Software Service makes available
all or the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of MOO for disk and '64.00 for cassette. None of the

First Steps
Take some good advice and you'll dispel! those bugged
listing blues forever
By Norman Doyle
"None of your listings ever work!"
This is typical of the subtle approach
of some of the readers who ring us
up. Then there follows a lengthy tirade
of abuse but eventually I  stop and
listen! Normally the fault isn't one of
ours b u t results fro m a  lack o f
understanding o f  d e b u g g i n g
techniques. To help here are some of
the common complaints and their
solutions.
"How can I type in all of the parts
of this program? The line numbers are
the same and just overwrite one
another."
There are many reasons why a
program can have several parts to it.
For example, there might be a Basic
master program which calls o n  a
machine code subroutine and has user-
deﬁned graphics. It could have been
writen as one program but the problem
is that once the code and graphics have
been poked i n to  memory these
substantial parts of the program are
then redundant and can slow down the
execution o f  th e  actual master
program. The solution is to use three
programs. The ﬁrst pokes the graphics
in place, the second positions the code
and the third is the real program.
The ﬁrst two programs look almost
identical because they are just reams
of data statements with a few short
lines of 'real' program. Typically, both
programs will start at line 10 and these
ﬁrst few lines will form a loop with
a pole command which pushes the data
into consecutive memory locations.
You then repeat the procedure for
program two and then, after saving
and newing, program three is typed
in and saved. If using a cassette as the
save device, the three programs should
follow one another in the correct order
on the tape.
Assuming that everything has been
typed i n  correctly, the program is
ready to run. This means that the ﬁrst
program is loaded and run. Often code
is stored at 49152 so the program will
BEGINNERS
ﬁll this area with numbers which form
the machine code part of the program.
Once the program ﬁnishes you can
safely use NEW to  get rid o f the
program without losing the code.
Why? Well, the NEW command only
changes a few bytes of memory and
the rest o f memory stays as i t was.
Although you can no longer list the
original program, the changes it has
made in memory will still be there.
Similarly, a fte r loading a n d
running the second program the values
poked into memory will stay ready for
the third program to access when it
is loaded and run. The only way that
the system can be defeated i s b y
switching the machine o ff between
loads.
"The program looks alright when I
check it with the listing but it still
produces errors."
First re-read the instructions to make
sure that there isn't something that
you've forgotten to do. If that checks
out OK there are several other areas
where errors can creep in. Parts of the
program within quotes (i.e. print and
input statements) can be ignored as
well a s  th e  contents o f  R E M
statements b u t  variables a n d
commands bear closer scrutiny.
If the error is syntactical make sure
that you've used the correct spelling,
ensure that commas, fullstops, semi-
colons and colons are used correctly.
If this all measures up make sure that
all of the zeros are actually the number
zero and not the letter '0 ' and vice
versa. The same applies to the number
one and letter
Sometimes a program line exactly
ﬁlls one screen line. If this is the case
there should be a full blank line left
when RETURN is pressed. I f  this is
not adhered to, the next line entered
will be concatenated (joined on) to the
current line and a  syntax error
generated when the program runs.
When listing the program, the line
looks quite acceptable but looks can

be deceptive so keep an eye open for
this error.
Data lines are by far the most likely
area for mistakes. It's a  long and
tedious job to type in rows of ﬁgures,
and errors often occur which are
difﬁcult to ﬁnd. It is difﬁcult to see
if a fullstop has been used instead of
a comma but the computer reads the
value as a  decimal and the data
becomes one item short. The only
solution is to exercise the utmost care
when typing in the data. To check for
errors, write a short program which
will read and print the data on the
screen. Substituting a suitable value
for x in the following short program
should do the trick:
FOR A=0 TO x  :READ Y:PRINT
Y:NEXT:END
For data which involves text change
Y to NI.
The main rule is to  maintain
concentration by doing a few lines.
resting and then tackling a few more
rather than slogging through to the
early hours. Always suspect your own
work because the listings are created
from working copies of the program
(occasionally errors do creep in but not
very often). I strongly advise that C64
owners use the Syntax Checker and
that everyone reads the Listings advice
page carefully. Diligence will reap its
own rewards with immediate success
- concentrate, persevere and you'll get
there in the end.

listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A. or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
1S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that IC-1-21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPCztj o r, exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,0]
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],[0
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T1 will
appear in ti listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine ke y
(R VSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RI/SOFT).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE june 1988
68
:CC=2*[P11*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

Iwo copies of your program on tap,.
or disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible a listing of your work (you
may omit this).
A stamped. self-addressed envelope
for return of the program to vou.
Should any of the above be missing

our query.
We will try to point out where you
have made errors and place a corrected

Do not send a program to us as

At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we receive hundreds of letters from readers every
month. We do try and answer each individually but sometimes this is impossible
due to pressure of work. If you have written to us and not received a personal
reply, we apologise for this but we cannot promise to reply to every item of mail
we receive. If you feel that your question or letter really needs an answer, then
inclusion of an s.a.e. will guarantee a reply, although this may still take time to
arrive.
An adventurer is returning home with
his treasure, which is slightly unusual
in that it consists of three monsters
which he is hoping to sell to Ye Olde
Wizard.
He comes to a river crossing with
a small boat tied up and herein lies
the problem. The boat is only big
enough to carry him and one of the
monsters at a time.
This gives the adventurer a head-
ache because the grifﬁn will eat the
troll is he leaves them along together
and the troll will eat the hobbit.
How does our intrepid hero get to
the other side o f the river with his
creatures still intact?

Commodore Where Are You?
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we are
repeatedly asked for the address and
telephone number o f  Commodore

their computer manuals, believe them
to be based in Corby.
The Commodore plant at Corby
was closed down some time ago.
Reproduced here you will ﬁnd the
correct address for Commodore U.K.
We suggest that you write this
correct address in the front o f your
computers manual  f o r  fu tu r e
reference.
Commodore Business Machine. (UK),
Commodore House,
The Switchback,
Gardner Road,
Maidenhead,

charge. Simply send an A4 size SAE
to our Golden Square address on the

These programs have sold thousands of
copies, and yet you won't have seen them
in the charts — why?
We produce programs that you can really
get y o u r te e th  in t o .  P ro g ra ms lik e
BUSICALC a nd BUS ICALC 3  which
can be used at home or in the ofﬁce to do
al so rt s o f calculations, forecasts and
budgets.
Programs like MIKRO ASSEMBLER and
the ZOOM monitor which make it easy to
write machine code programs. Programs
like MUSIC MASTER wh ich  turn yo u r
computer into a musical instrument. And
programs like the BLITZ compiler which
makes ordinary BASIC programs ru n
much, much faster,
We have b e e n writ in g  p ro g ra ms f o r
Commodore computers since 1978 and
now have hundreds of programs for the
PET, VIC 20, CBM 64, CBM 128. even the
C16 a n d  Plus/4. S o  w h y  aren't o u r
programs in the charts?
Because our programs aren't one minute
wonders, here today and gone tomorrow.
Programs we released for the 64 in 1983
are still selling — and even more impor-
tant, the people who bought them then
are still using them.
Software should be an investment, not
money down the drain. We believe that
the more you put into a program, the
more you should get out of it, and that's
the wa y  i t  wo rks wit h  software f ro m
