Voltage Gated Na+ & K+ Channels 
Depolarization of the membrane is the stimulus which leads to both channels opening. 
To reset the Na+ channel from inactive to closed need to repolarize the membrane. 
Refractory period is when Na+ channels are inactivated.

Action Potentials 
are rapid, “all or none” and do not decay over 
distances

Action potentials move one-way along the axon because of the absolute refractory period of the voltage gated 
Na+ channel.

Input: 
Dendrites: ligand gated ion channels, some voltage gated  
 
    channels; graded potentials 
 
Cell body (Soma): ligand gated ion channels; 
 
   graded potentials  
 
 
 
 
 
Output: 
Axon: voltage gated ion channels, action potentials 
 
Axon initial segment: highest density of voltage  
 
gated ion channels & lowest threshold for initiating 
 
an action potential, “integrative zone”

Large diameter, myelinated axons transmit action  
 
 
potentials very rapidly. 
Voltage gated channels are concentrated at the nodes.  
Inactivation of voltage gated Na+ channels insures uni-directional propagation along the axon.

Key Concepts 
An action potential is a wave of depolarization followed 
immediately by a wave of repolarization. During an action 
potential, depolarization is due to the movement of Na+ into 
the nerve cell. Repolarization is due to the movement of K+ 
out of the cell.  
 
Action potentials are electrical signals that propagate without 
decrement along axons, are “all or none”, have refractory 
periods, and uni-directional propagation in neurons.
