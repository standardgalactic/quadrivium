About the Author
Karen S. Fredricks began her life rather non-technically growing up in Kenya.
She attended high school in Beirut, Lebanon — where she developed her
sense of humor while dodging bombs. After traveling all over the world,
Karen ended up at the University of Florida and has since been an ardent
Gator fan. In addition to undergraduate studies in English and accounting,
Karen has a Master’s degree in psycholinguistics. Beginning her career teach-
ing high school English and theatre, Karen switched to working with the PC in
its inception in the early ’80s — and has worked as a full-time computer con-
sultant and trainer ever since.
Karen is an ACT! Certified Consultant, an ACT! Premier Trainer, and a
QuickBooks Premier Certified Advisor. She is the author of many training
manuals and a contributor to numerous newsletters. A true ACT! FanACTic,
she founded the ACT! Users Group of South Florida and served as the official
host for the ACT! 6 Launch Tour in Florida.
Karen resides in Boca Raton, Florida, with her long-suffering husband
Gordon, over-achieving daughters Andrea and Alyssa, and her little white dog
Carolina. Her company, Tech Benders, provides computer consulting, sup-
port, and training services. In her spare time, Karen loves to play tennis and
write schlocky poetry. Feel free to send your comments about the book to
dummies@techbenders.com.
Dedication
In loving memory of Betsy Fredricks Levine (1959-2000).
I know you’re still making friends out of strangers and asking questions along
the way. We miss you!


Author’s Acknowledgments
I have been blessed with so many wonderful people in my life that I hardly
know where to begin.
The people at Wiley Publishing have been the greatest to work with and have
made writing this book a true pleasure! Special thanks to my Acquisitions
Editor, Terri Varveris, for discovering and having faith in me. Thanks for
going that extra mile, Terri!
Thanks also to the entire ACT! Certified Consultant community for their will-
ingness to share and to Best, CRM for their continuing support. Susan Clark —
you are one, class ACT!; Lon Orenstein and Steve McCandlish — you are my
idols among ACT! Certified Consultants!; Melissa and Ted — thanks for all
your effort and hard work.
I’d like to also thank my marketing guru, Norma Wolpin, who qualifies as a
true ACT! FanACTic — even if her coffee skills are no better than mine! Hugs
go to Cecelia Alvarez, my wonderful assistant and ACT! Certified Consultant,
for being my right hand — and for letting me steal her terrific layouts! Special
greetings go out to my Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday games at the Swim
and Racquet Center of Boca Raton and to the CLAWS of Boca for your contin-
uing support, love, and friendship. You guys rock!
When I grow up, I want to be just like my mom and dad! Mom is 87, has fewer
senior moments than I do, volunteers at church several times a week, and
has one of the most active social lives in South Florida. At 83, Papa Carl plays
tennis, takes his boat out on Coast Guard patrols, and still does tax returns.
You two are inspirational!
Words can’t describe how special my daughters are to me. You have brought
such joy to my life and are a constant source of pride and support. Love 
and thanks go out to “Dr.” Andrea Fredricks and the very theatrical Alyssa
Fredricks for putting up with my lack of presence over the last few months.
Although we have all pursued very different paths in life, the three Fredricks
women all share a single-minded devotion and dedication to the things —
and people — we love!
And finally Gordon, my best friend, husband, and partner, deserves special
recognition for being the #1 Dummy in my life — and I mean that in only the
best of ways! He proofread, stapled, offered suggestions, and kept me sup-
plied with red licorice as I typed away. He’s also remained relatively sane
despite living with his Type A wife for the past 27 years. T.B., I know you’re
now capable of writing Grocery Shopping For Dummies. I couldn’t have done it
without your help. I love you!

Introduction
A
CT! is the best-selling contact manager that’s used by more than 
4 million professionals and 11,000 corporations worldwide. For many of
these users, ACT! represents their first foray into the area of contact relation-
ship management (CRM). Contact management software is a little more com-
plex to understand than other types of software. With a word processor, each
document that you create is totally separate; if you make a mistake, you need
only to delete your current document and start fresh. Contact management,
however, builds its way into a final product; if you don’t give a bit of thought
as to what goal you wish to achieve, you could end up with a muddled mess.
I am a fanACTic. I’m not ashamed to admit it. I use ACT! at work. I use ACT! on
the road. I use ACT! at home. I’ve even inspired my friends to use ACT!. I’m
excited about the product and know that by the time you learn to unleash the
power of ACT!, you’ll be excited, too.
So what am I so excited about? I’ve seen firsthand how ACT! can save you
time and help make you more efficient in the bargain. To me, accomplishing
more in less time is an exciting thought — it allows more time for the fun
things in life. Best of all, ACT! is a program that’s very easy to master in a
very short time. You’ll be amazed not only at how quickly you can set up a
database but also at how easily you can put that database to work.
Maybe by the time you finish this book, you, too, will have become a
fanACTic!
About This Book
ACT! 2005 For Dummies is a reference book. As such, each chapter can be
read independently and in the order you want. Each chapter focuses on a
specific topic, so you can dive right in, heading straight for the chapter that
interests you most. Having said that, however, I must say that I’ve tried to put
the chapters into a logical sequence so that those of you who are new to ACT!
can just follow the bouncing ball from chapter to chapter. More experienced
users can use the Table of Contents and the index to simply navigate from
topic to topic as needed.

Essentially, this book is a nuts-and-bolts how-to guide for accomplishing vari-
ous tasks. In addition, drawing on many of my own experiences as a full-time
ACT! consultant and trainer, I’ve included specific situations that should give
you a feeling for the full power of ACT!.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like in most Windows-based software programs, you often have several dif-
ferent ways to accomplish a task in ACT!.
For the most part, I show you ways to perform a function by using the ACT!
menus. When an instruction reads Choose File➪Open, you must access the
File menu (located at the top of the ACT! screen) by clicking it with the left
mouse button and then choosing the Open option from the subsequent menu
that appears. In most cases, you can access these commands from anywhere
within ACT!, although I generally advise new ACT! users to always start a task
from the Contact Detail view which is the first window you’ll see when ACT!
opens. If you must be in a particular area to complete a task otherwise, I tell
you where.
I also present you with shortcuts here and there. Generally, ACT! shortcuts
are triggered by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl key and another key on the
keyboard. For instance, the shortcut for recording a history is Ctrl+H.
At times, you need to access one of ACT!’s hidden menus, which you do by
clicking an appropriate area of the screen with the right mouse button and
then choosing from the menu that appears. In these instances, I simply say
right-click when you need to right-click.
What You Should Read
Of course, I’m hoping that you’re going to sit down and read this entire book
from cover to cover. But then again, this book isn’t the Great American Novel.
And, come to think of it, the whole reason why you bought this book in the
first place is because you want to get your ACT! together (no groans, please!)
as quickly as possible because you’re probably finding yourself with too
much to do and too little time to do it in.
2
ACT! 2005 For Dummies 

For the time being, I’m going to let you get away with just reading the parts
that interest you most. I’ll let you read the last chapter first and the first
chapter last if you’d like because this book is designed to allow you to read
each chapter independently. However, when you find yourself floating in a
swimming pool, soaking up the sun, and wondering what to do with all your
spare time, you might want to go back and read some of those chapters you
skipped. You just might discover something!
What You Don’t Have to Read
This book is intended for both new and existing ACT! users. Most of the
instructions apply to both groups of readers. Once in a while, I include some
information that might be of special interest to more advanced readers.
Newbies, feel free to skip these sections! Also, any information tagged with a
Technical Stuff icon is there for the truly technically inclined. Everyone else
can just skip this info.
Foolish Assumptions
One of my least favorite words in the English language is the word assume,
but I’ve got to admit that I’ve made a few foolish — albeit necessary —
assumptions when writing this book. First of all, I assume that you own a
computer and that ACT! is installed on it. Secondly, I assume that you have a
basic knowledge of how to use your computer, keyboard, and mouse, and
that ACT! isn’t the very first application that you’re trying to master.
I’ve also assumed that you have a genuine desire to organize your life and/or
business and have determined that ACT! is the way to go.
Finally (and I feel quite comfortable with this assumption), I assume that
you’ll grow to love ACT! as much as I do.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized this book into six parts. Each part contains several chapters
covering related topics. The following is a brief description of each part, with
chapter references directing you where to go for particular information:
3
Introduction

Part I: The Opening ACT!
In Part I, you get an introduction to the concept of a database and why ACT!
has become such a popular choice of database users (Chapter 1). In this part,
you read about what to expect the first time you fire up ACT! (Chapter 2) and
how to set the main preferences in ACT! (Chapter 3).
Part II: Putting the ACT!
Database to Work
Part II focuses on putting your contacts into ACT! (Chapter 4) and, more
importantly, how to find them again (Chapters 6 and 7). I show you how to
view all the details about one contact, how to pull up a list of all your con-
tacts, and even how to create an easy list report.
After you master organizing your contact information, Part II helps you orga-
nize your day. ACT! makes it easy to take notes (Chapter 8) so that you start
relying on ACT! more and your memory less. You find out how to schedule
appointments, calls, and to-dos — and other important events in your life.
And, you discover how to view those activities in the daily, weekly, and
monthly calendars (Chapter 9). Your life can become complicated, but have
no fear because ACT! does its best to help you navigate through the maze. The
History, Documents, and Secondary Contacts tabs allow you to accumulate
lots of information about each and every one of your contacts (Chapter 5).
Part III: Sharing Your Information 
with Others
Corporate America lives for reports, and ACT! is up to the challenge. Whether
you want to print labels or telephone directories on commercially printed
forms or prefer to utilize the ACT! built-in reports (Chapter 11), Part III shows
you how. I even tell you about building your own reports from scratch
(Chapter 12).
One of the best features of ACT! is the ability to communicate easily with the
outside world. Part III shows you how to work with templates to automate
routine documents as well as how to send out mass mail merges — whether
by snail mail, fax, or e-mail (Chapter 13). You also discover the advantages of
using ACT! for your e-mail client (Chapter 14).
4
ACT! 2005 For Dummies 

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing
We’re all different and often like to do things in our own unique way. ACT!
understands that concept and allows you to customize it to your heart’s con-
tent. At first glance, ACT! may seem like just an over-the-counter piece of soft-
ware, but by adding fields (Chapter 15) and placing them on customized
layouts (Chapter 16), you can make it perform as well as an expensive piece
of proprietary software.
Every database needs an Administrator. If you’re elected to the job, you need
to know how to perform administrative tasks, such as adding users, checking
for duplicate data entry, and performing routine maintenance (Chapter 17). If
you have remote users that need to access all or parts of your database you
need to know how to synchronize your database (Chapter 18).
Part V: Commonly Overlooked 
ACT! Features
Part V focuses on four of the most frequently overlooked ACT! features:
 Microsoft integration: Synchronize your ACT! and Outlook address
books and calendars; attach a Web site in Internet Explorer directly to
an ACT! contact; and explore the various ways that you can use ACT!
and Excel together (Chapter 19).
 Sales opportunities: Track your prospective sales, prioritize them, and
analyze what you did right — or wrong — in making the sale (Chapter 20).
 Groups: Group your contacts together to add a new dimension to your
database (Chapter 21).
 Companies: This is an exciting new feature of ACT! 2005. The Company
feature enables you to view and edit contacts that all “belong” to the
same company (Chapter 22).
Part VI: The Part of Tens
With apologies to David Letterman, you have three of my favorite ACT! lists.
First, in Chapter 23, I give you a list of the major differences between ACT!
2005 Standard Edition and ACT! 2005 Premium Edition. Then in Chapter 24, 
I list my favorite new ACT! 2005 features — which is specifically designed for
anyone who has used a previous version of ACT!. In Chapter 25, I give you ten
of my favorite ways to customize your layouts.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
The Tip icon indicates a special timesaving tip or a related thought that
might help you use ACT! to its full advantage. Try it; you might like it!
The Warning icon alerts you to the danger of proceeding without caution. 
Do not attempt to try doing anything that you are warned not to do!
The Remember icon alerts you to important pieces of information that you
don’t want to forget.
The Technical Stuff icon indicates tidbits of advanced knowledge that might
be of interest to IT specialists but might just bore the heck out of the average
reader. Skip these at will.
Where to Go from Here
For those of you who are ACT! old-timers, you might want to at least skim the
entire contents of this book before hunkering down to read the sections that
seem the most relevant to you. My experience is that the average ACT! user is
probably only using a portion of the program and might not even be aware of
some of the really cool features of ACT!. You might be surprised to discover
all that ACT! has to offer!
For the ACT! newbie, I recommend heading straight for Part I, where you can
acquaint yourself with ACT! before moving on to other parts of the book and
of the ACT! program.

ACT! 2005 For Dummies 

Part I
The Opening ACT!

In this part . . .
You’re excited about all the possibilities that ACT! has
to offer and want to dive into the program as soon 
as possible. Here’s where you’ll ﬁnd an overview of some
of the cool features that you’ll ﬁnd in ACT!. You’ll also
become familiar with the many faces of ACT!; after all, you
wouldn’t want to get lost along the way. But ﬁrst you have
to do a bit of homework and whip ACT! into shape by ﬁd-
dling with a few preference settings to ensure that ACT!
will produce the type of results that you’re looking for.

Chapter 1
An Overview of ACT!
In This Chapter
 The history of ACT!
 What is ACT!?
 Who uses ACT!?
 Basic ACT! concepts
 A few basic ground rules
S
o what is ACT!, anyway? I find that one of the hardest things that I have
to do with ACT! is to explain exactly what it is. I like to initially explain
ACT! by using very politically correct terminology. For example, ACT! 2005
 Is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software Package
 Provides users and organizations with powerful tools to manage their
business relationships
 Is a packaged software product that can be customized based on your
company’s requirements
 Is the world’s leading CRM software
Feel free to use these points to impress your friends. If, after telling all this to
your friends, they still look at you rather blankly, at least you know that your
knowledge of computing is equal to — if not greater than — theirs. At that
point, you may want to list some of the wonderful features of ACT!, which I 
do in the first section of this chapter. I also describe the typical ACT! user
and give you a brief primer on some pertinent ACT! terminology. Finally, I end
the chapter with a few ground rules that I’ve established over the years. I’ve
watched new users wrestle with certain aspects of using ACT!, and I want to
save you the trouble.

What Does ACT! Do?
Using ACT! allows me to have more free time — which means that I have
more playtime. Because I want you to enjoy the benefits of using ACT!, I’ve
put together a little shopping list of features so that you can see all that ACT!
can do for you, too. In parentheses after each item, I include a chapter refer-
ence where you can find more information about a particular feature (if
you’re so inclined).
ACT! is a multifaceted personal management tool that
 Stores complete contact information, including name, company, phone
numbers, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses. (Chapter 4)
 Comes with over 50 predefined fields for each contact that you add to
your database. If you want to add new ones to meet your specific needs,
go right ahead. (Chapter 15)
 Records an unlimited number of dated notes for each of your contacts
so that you can easily keep track of important conversations and activi-
ties. This feature is particularly useful for those of us who, unlike our
friend the elephant, do forget things on occasion. (Chapter 8)
 Keeps more than a boring old calendar. Your scheduled activities are
cross-referenced with the appropriate contact so that you have a full
record of all interactions that you have had — or will have — with that
contact. In addition, you can set an alarm to remind you of the impor-
tant stuff, and roll over the less important things until the next day.
(Chapter 9)
 Prints out anything from simple phone lists, or address books, to detailed
reports on activities, notes, leads, and sales opportunities. You can print
reports of your reports if you feel so inclined. (Chapters 11and 12)
 Creates mailing labels and envelopes. Or, if you prefer, perform broad-
cast faxes and e-mails with ACT!. (Chapters 13 and 14)
 Manages your sales pipeline with built-in forecasting tools. If you’re so
inclined, print a few sales reports — or create a graph showing your
open, won, or lost sales. (Chapter 20)
 Synchronizes data with remote users. (Chapter 18)
 Lets you design and activate a series of activities so that you’re reminded
of your tasks — assuring that none of your contacts “fall through the
cracks.” (Chapter 10)

Part I: The Opening ACT! 

The Typical ACT! User
So just who is the typical ACT! user? Well, with more than 4 million users and
11,000 businesses currently using ACT!, you are safe to assume that nearly
every industry is represented among its user base. Although ACT! started as
primarily a tool for salespeople wanting to follow up on their prospects and
customers, ACT! has evolved into a tool used by any individual or business
trying to organize the chaos of daily life.
I think it’s only fair to warn you about one of the possible side effects that
you might develop if you use ACT!. If you’re anything like me, you’ll become
addicted to ACT! and eventually use it to manage all facets of your busy exis-
tence. You might just become a fanACTic. Quite simply, a fanACTic is an ACT!
user who has become addicted to using ACT!.
So just who is using ACT!? Everyone.
 The CEO uses ACT! because he wants to know what his salespeople are
doing and how his customers are being treated.
 The administrative assistant is using it to automate routine tasks and to
keep a schedule of various tasks and activities.
 A salesperson is using ACT! to make sure that she’s following up on all
her prospects.
 The disorganized person finds that using ACT! can help him become
more organized.
 The smart person uses ACT! because she knows that she’ll have more
time to play by working more efficiently.
 The lazy person uses ACT! because he knows it’s more fun to play than
to work.
So what kinds of businesses use ACT!? All kinds.
 Large businesses that want to improve communication among employees
 Small businesses that have to rely on a small staff to complete a multi-
tude of tasks
 Businesses of all sizes looking for software that can automate their busi-
nesses and make them more productive in less time
 Businesses looking to grow by marketing to their prospects
 Businesses looking to retain their current customers by providing an
excellent level of customer service and developing lasting relationships
11
Chapter 1: An Overview of ACT!

So who’s not using ACT!? Okay, I just said that simply everyone is using ACT!,
but a few stubborn folks remain out there who aren’t looking to organize their
lives, such as
 Workaholics who live to spend every waking moment at work
 People who don’t use even a paper address book to keep track of their
contacts
 Hermits who don’t need to schedule any appointments or remember to
make follow-up phone calls
 Individuals with photographic memories who retain all information and
never need to take a note
 Companies that require no paperwork
 Businesses that do no marketing or that have no interest in expanding
their customer base
Terms You Need to Know
Nobody likes technical jargon, but in the course of showing you how to use
ACT!, I might end up lapsing into Geek Speak and use a handful of somewhat
technical terms; I just can’t avoid it. Becoming familiar with them now just
may be less painful in the long run.
ACT! is a database program. A database is a collection of information orga-
nized in such a way that the user of the database can quickly find desired
pieces of information. You might want to think of a database as an electronic
filing system. Although most ACT! users create a database of contacts, some
users develop ACT! databases to collect information about things other than
contacts. For example, you might create an ACT! database to catalog all the
CDs and DVDs in your collection.
Traditional databases are organized by fields, records, and files:
 A field is a single piece of information. In databases, fields are the small-
est units of information. A tax form, for example, contains a number of
fields: one for your name, one for your Social Security number, one for
your income, and so on. In ACT!, you start with 50 separate fields for
each individual contact. You find out how to add information into these
fields in Chapter 4. And, in Chapter 15, I show you how to change the
attributes of existing fields and how to add new ones to your database if
you’re the database administrator.
12
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

 A record is one complete set of fields. In ACT!, all the information that
you collect that pertains to one individual contact is a contact record.
 A file is the entire collection of data or information. Each database that
you create in ACT! is given a unique filename; creating more than one file
or database in ACT! is possible — head to Chapter 3 to find out how.
The Basic ACT! Ground Rules
Sometimes you just need to learn things the hard way. After all, experience is
the best teacher. Luckily for you, however, I’ve compiled a list of rules based
on a few mistakes that I see other ACT! users commit. You’re not going to find
these rules written down anywhere else. And they may not even make a
whole lot of sense to you at the moment. But as you become more and more
familiar with ACT!, these rules will make all the sense in the world. You might
even want to refer to them from time to time.
Karen’s Four Rules of Always:
 Always log in to ACT! as yourself.
 Always strive for standardization in your database by entering your data
in a consistent manner.
 Always input as much information into your database as possible.
 Always compress and reindex and perform a backup of your database at
least once a week!
The Two ACT! Flavors
New to ACT! version 7 are two separate editions. Everything I cover in this
book applies to both versions of ACT!:
 ACT! Standard Edition 2005.
 ACT! Premium Edition 2005. 
The Premium Edition contains some features not found in the Standard
Edition; I do not cover those additional Premium features in this book. 
All users sharing the same database must be using the same edition of ACT!.
13
Chapter 1: An Overview of ACT!

You can read more about the differences in the two editions in Chapter 23 
but for now, I want you to be aware of the basic differences between the two
versions.
ACT! Standard Edition 2005
 Utilizes the Desktop Edition (MSDE) version of SQL
 Is designed for individuals and small workgroups
 Allows a maximum of 10 active named users per database
 Can be purchased at any of the major retail chains
 Can’t open a database created using ACT! Premium Edition 2005
ACT! Premium Edition 2005 for Workgroups
 Includes MS SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition but can also work with
MSDE if preferred
 Is designed for the corporate “enterprise” user
 Does not place a limit on the number of database users
 Can only be purchased through volume licensing distributors
 Can open a database created using ACT! Standard, or can save a data-
base to a Standard format
So what are you waiting for? Boot up your computer, grab the book, and get
going. After all, it’s time to ACT! (pun intended).

Chapter 2
The Various Faces of ACT!
In This Chapter
 Starting the correct database
 Logging in correctly
 Knowing about the My Record
 Maneuvering in ACT!
 Getting help with ACT!
A
fter getting the hang of maneuvering in ACT!, you’ll find that it’s an
amazingly easy program to master. The key is to become familiar with
the lay of the land before you start building your contact database. By doing
so, you avoid playing hide-and-seek later. To that end, I show you how to log
into and open an ACT! database. Although initially getting around in ACT! is
pretty easy, you might become lost in the maze of views and tabs that ACT! is
divided into. I help you navigate through that maze by taking you on a tour of
ACT! so that you can become familiar with the various ACT! screens. Finally,
you discover the places that you can turn to if you need additional help.
Locating the Correct Database
When you open ACT!, by default, ACT! opens up the database that was last
open on your computer. Easy enough, huh? If, however, you stumble into the
incorrect database by mistake, you need to know how to find the correct one.
If you’re lucky enough to have inherited a database that someone else devel-
oped (someone who maybe even placed that database on your computer for
you), be sure to ask where that database is located — before that person
walks out of your life.
In Chapter 3, I show you how to change the default database location; that’s
the place on your computer that ACT! uses to store any new databases that
you create and look in to open any existing database. If, by chance, your data-
base isn’t in the default location, you have to change the default location 
(as I discuss in Chapter 3), move your database to the correct location, or
browse to the location of your database.

The first screen that you see when opening ACT! each and every time is the
Contacts Detail window. If you click around and end up in any of the other
ACT! screens, don’t panic. One of the nice things about ACT! is that you’re
able to execute most commands from any ACT! screen (unless I tell you oth-
erwise). And I promise that pretty soon the various screens become so famil-
iar to you that you’ll navigate through ACT! with the best of them.
To open a database, make sure that ACT! is open and then follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open Database from the ACT! Contact Detail window.
The Open dialog box appears (see Figure 2-1).
2. Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Look In box.
3. Double-click to expand the folder that contains your database.
4. Select the name of your database and then click Open.
If you prefer, double-click the name of the database that you want to
open.
When you open an ACT! database, you are actually using a “shortcut”; these
shortcuts all end with the .pad file extension. ACT! actually stores three dif-
ferent groups of data:
 Main database: The main database consists of all of your contacts’ infor-
mation, activities, notes, histories, and so on. The database files are
stored on your local machine by default. You can move the database and
all associated files to another location or even over to a network drive if
you so desire.
Figure 2-1:
Opening 
an ACT!
database.
16
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

 Database supplemental files: These files and folders are automatically
created when you create a new database and include layouts, templates,
e-mail messages, and any attachments associated with a contact record.
You cannot change the location of these files in the database; they are
automatically stored as part of your database.
 Personal supplemental files: These files are saved to your local com-
puter, and include files such as word processing documents not associ-
ated with a contact, newly created layouts, and templates. E-mail
messages and attachments not associated with contacts are also saved
as personal supplemental files.
The ACT! Login Screen
If more than one person is sharing your ACT! database, ACT! presents you
with a login screen each time that you attempt to open your database.
Essentially, the login screen, as shown in Figure 2-2, asks you for your user
name and your password. Your user name and password are not case sensi-
tive (that is, you can enter your name by typing either lowercase or UPPER-
CASE letters). You also need to make sure that you enter your user name and
password information correctly. For example, if my user name includes my
middle initial with a period, I must type that middle initial — including the
period — to gain access to my database.
Generally, the administrator of your database determines your password.
The database administrator is the person responsible for making major
changes to the database and for performing routine database maintenance.
Although several users may all have access to an ACT! database, ACT! doesn’t
require that each user have a password. So if the database administrator
didn’t assign you a password, just leave the password area blank.
If you are assigned a password, notice that asterisks appear while you type it
in. That’s normal. Just like when you type your ATM card PIN, your ACT! data-
base password is hidden while you type it to prevent any lurking spies who
might be watching from learning your password. You’re able to change your
own password; see Chapter 3 to find out how.
Figure 2-2:
Logging in
to ACT!.
17
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

Figure 2-2 shows that ACT! gives you the option of saving your password 
(an option automatically selected by default). Although this option helps you
to log in to your database in the future, you may want to rethink this deci-
sion. First of all, what good is a password if it always magically appears any-
time that you attempt to access your database? Secondly, by having ACT!
remember your password, you may eventually forget it yourself!
The Importance of Being My Record
The first contact that you see when opening an ACT! database is your own —
that’s your My Record. My Record is nothing more than a contact record that
is associated with a user of the database. Your My Record stores all your own
information, which automatically appears in some of the preset templates
that come with ACT!. For example, a fax cover sheet includes your telephone
and fax numbers; a report has your name at the top; and a letter has your
name at the bottom. If, for some reason, someone else’s information appears
as the first contact record that you see when you open your database,
explore these three possibilities:
 Did you log in as yourself? If not, do so. Then, when you open ACT! 
again — logged in as yourself — your My Record appears.
 Did you inadvertently change your own contact information? If that’s the
case, change it back.
 If you’re 100 percent certain that you logged in as yourself and haven’t
changed your contact information, your database is likely corrupted. I’m
not trying to scare you, but I recommend that you turn to Chapter 17,
where I show you how to perform a little CPR on your database.
Taking the time to enter in all your own contact information is very impor-
tant. If you don’t, you may find that you’re missing key information when you
start to work with templates and reports. For example, if you never enter
your own fax number, your fax number doesn’t appear on the Fax Cover
Sheet template, which means you have to fill it in every time that you send a
fax. Save yourself the trouble and fill in your My Record right off the bat.
Your My Record also allows you to use a few other important ACT! features:
 Permission to perform various functions is based on the security level of
your My Record.
 Contacts, notes, histories, activities, and opportunities marked as 
“private” can only be viewed by the Record Manager who created them.
18
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

 Every time that you enter a new contact, your name appears as the cre-
ator of that contact.
 When you delete a contact, a history of that deletion appears in the
History area of your My Record.
 Every time that you add a note to a contact record, your name appears
as the Record Manager of that note.
 When you schedule an activity, your name automatically attaches to that
activity.
Finding Your Way Around in ACT!
The purpose of this book is to serve as a reference book for both new and
existing ACT! users. I certainly don’t want to lose anyone along the way. New
ACT! users might be somewhat intimidated when they encounter ACT! for the
first time. Be assured that this experience is akin to the first time you drive a
new car at night in the rain: momentary panic sets in. After you’ve driven 
the car for a week or so, the location of the light and windshield wiper con-
trols becomes second nature. I guarantee you’ll have the same experience
with ACT!.
Navigating through ACT! is fairly easy. However, to make the navigating even
easier, I highlight throughout this section a number of pitfalls that you want
to avoid.
The title bar
The title bar provides you with several pieces of key information:
 The software name
 The database name
 The user’s name
Don’t overlook the importance of this wealth of information! If your title bar
reads Free Cell, it’s a good indication that you’ve stumbled into the wrong
piece of software. If the database name indicates ACT7demo, chances are
pretty good that you’re in the wrong database and may be adding hundreds
of new contacts to the wrong place. And if the user name is not yours, you
may not be getting the appropriate credit for all your hours of hard work. You
can see the title bar, along with other key areas of ACT!, in Figure 2-3.
19
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

The record counter
ACT! supplies you with a record counter in the top-left corner of the Contact
Detail window (refer to Figure 2-3). The first number indicates the number of
your record as it relates alphabetically to the other members of your current
lookup. This number changes when you add or remove contacts. The second
number supplies you with the total number of contacts in either your entire
database or your current lookup. (A lookup refers to the contacts in your
database that you’re currently working with. You can find out everything that
you ever want to know about a lookup in Chapter 7.)

20
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

I recommend getting into the habit of checking the total number of contacts
in your database each time you open ACT!. If the total number of contacts
changes radically from one day to the next, you just might be in the wrong
database. Worse yet, a dramatic change in the number of contacts may indi-
cate corruption in your database.
To the left and right of the record counter is a set of left- and right-pointing
triangles. You can click these triangles to navigate through the contact
records. For instance, to go to the previous record, you simply click the left-
pointing triangle. Refer to Figure 2-3, which shows how to use these triangles.
The layout
One of the biggest sources of confusion to the new ACT! user is the use of 
layouts. The layout refers to the order in which fields appear on the ACT!
screens as well as the colors, fonts, and graphics that you see. You can spec-
ify the colors, fonts, and graphics in the layout as well as the position and
order of fields. If the database administrator created new fields for the data-
base, these fields must then be added to a layout.
 You can modify the contact, company, and group layouts or create your
own layouts to suit your needs.
There’s no right or wrong layout — only the layout that you prefer. For
example, the Sales Department may need to see one set of fields, but the
Customer Service Department may need to see an entirely different
group of fields — and want them to appear in a specific order.
 You can remove fields that you don’t use or move fields to other tabs.
 You can add your own tabs to the bottom of a layout.
Renaming and reordering the tabs to your liking helps you organize your
fields. For example, you might want to keep all the personal information
about a customer on one tab and the products that he’s interested in on
another tab.
You can find the name of the layout by clicking the Layout button in the
lower-left corner of the ACT! screen, as shown in Figure 2-3. If you inadver-
tently switch layouts, you might not be able to see all the information in your
database, or you might see your information arranged in a different order. 
At this point, panic often sets in. Don’t worry — your data is most probably
alive and well and viewable with the help of the correct layout. To switch 
layouts, click the Layout button to access a list of all layouts; from that list,
choose a different layout. In Chapter 16, I explain how you can create your
own customized layouts.
21
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

Make sure you take the time to acquaint yourself with the name of the layout
that you’re using. You might find yourself the victim of one of those random,
drive-by clickings you’ve been hearing so much about and end up in the
“wrong” layout. If you know the name of your preferred layout you can easily
“find” it again.
The menu bar
Like most software programs, ACT! comes equipped with a menu bar that
appears at the top of every ACT! screen. These menus include all the options
available for the current view. Unlike most other software programs, however,
ACT!’s menu options are dependent on the view that you are currently in. If
you are in Contact Detail window, the various tab options appear in the Edit
menu; if you’re in the Contact List, however, the tab options are grayed out,
indicating that that option is not currently available.
You’re able to customize all menus to fit your needs; check out Chapter 3 for
the details.
A quick way to familiarize yourself with ACT! is to click each and every one of
the menu items. Doing so may seem like a waste of time at first but you might
see something that piques your interest. You might click the Schedule menu
and notice the Activity Series option. Hopefully, curiosity overcomes you,
and you have an overwhelming desire to find more about that feature. Or you
might notice the Sort choice listed in the Edit menu and think hmmm, maybe
I can sort my database in a different order than alphabetically by company.
The toolbar
ACT! also features a toolbar at the top of each window. The toolbar includes
the most commonly used tasks of the current view. Toolbars work in much the
same way as the menu bars. You can customize each toolbar to include the
tasks that you use most frequently. And, like the menu bars, toolbars vary
depending on the current view that you’re looking at. For example, the tool-
bars that you see in the calendar views include a Show Filter/Hide Filter icon
to change the view settings on your calendar, and the toolbar that you see in
the Group Detail window include icons for creating groups and subgroups.
The Back and Forward bar
Lurking just below the toolbar is the Back and Forward bar. The Back and
Forward bar provides you with a road map of sorts by letting you know the
exact area of ACT! that you’re currently working in. And, like your Internet
22
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

browser, the Back and Forward bar has handy-dandy left- and right-pointing
arrows that allow you to return to the previous window you were viewing.
The Contact Detail window
When you first open up ACT!, you land in the Contact Detail window, which
allows you to see all the information about one specific contact. You can use
the Contact Detail window to enter, modify, and view information about your
contacts. Each contact record displays as a single page that is divided into a
top and bottom half:
 The top half of the screen contains generic fields that are probably used
by just about all ACT! users everywhere. Many of these fields are used
extensively in the templates (that is, reports, letters, fax cover sheets,
and labels) that ACT! has already set up for you.
 The tabs at the bottom provide additional fields for each of your 
contacts.
You can — and should — customize the bottom half of the screen to
better serve the needs of your business. You can click through the page
tabs in the middle of the screen to get an idea of some of the fields sug-
gested by ACT!. I show you how to add contact information into your
database in Chapter 4 and how to modify those tabs in Chapter 16.
The Divider bar
One of the fast food chains used to have a jingle about “having it your way” a
number of years back and you might want to hum a few bars of that tune
each time you open ACT!. A point in case is the Divider bar that separates the
top half of the Contact Detail window. Got a lot of fields in the top half of your
screen? Grab the Divider bar and drag it down. Want to have more room to
view some of the tabs along the bottom? Grab that bar and drag it up a bit.
The Navigation bar
ACT!’s Navigation — or Nav — bar is the column of icons located along the
left side of the program. The Nav bar allows you to move quickly between the
various areas in ACT!. For example, maybe you want to view all the informa-
tion about one particular contact by clicking the Contacts icon, or maybe you
want to see a list of all your groups by clicking the Groups icon.
23
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

The ACT! tabs
Because ACT! comes with approximately 50 predefined fields, and because
your database administrator might add another 50 or so customized fields,
placing those fields where you can see them clearly is important. Plunking
100 fields on one half of your screen gives you a jumbled mess. I suppose that
you could lay out those fields by using a smaller font, but the result —
although neat — is impossible to read!
ACT! solves this dilemma in a rather unique fashion. The top half of the
Contact Detail window displays the most basic fields that are fairly typical to
all contacts. In this portion of the screen, the fields include places for the
name, address, and phone numbers as well as a few miscellaneous fields. The
bottom half of the ACT! screen displays additional information about your
contact that’s divided into categories, which you access by clicking tabs
located across the middle of the Contact Detail window.
The first seven tabs (refer to Figure 2-3) — Notes, History, Activities,
Opportunities, Groups/Companies, Secondary Contacts, and Documents — are
called system tabs. The system tabs are actually tables; they don’t hold single
fields with a single piece of information in each one. Rather, you can add an
unlimited number of like items to the same tab. For example, you can add
multiple notes about your contact using the Notes tab, or you might have
numerous sales opportunities that involve your current contact displayed
on the Opportunities tab.
Because the system tabs contain tables rather than fields, you can’t cus-
tomize them in the same way as the other tabs. However, you can remove a
system tab or change their order. Chapter 16 shows you how to fix the order.
Depending on the layout you’re using, you probably see several additional
tabs after the system tabs. These tabs generally display less frequently used
information about your contact, such as these:
 The User Fields tab displays ten user fields; these fields are just waiting
for you to customize them.
 The Home Address tab reveals your contact’s home address, personal
e-mail address, and phone number as well as the spouse’s name.
You can find out how to customize the user fields in Chapter 15 and the lay-
outs in Chapter 16.
All the tabs are dependent on the layout that you’re currently using. If you
switch layouts, your tabs change as well.
24
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Some of the ACT! add-on products add new tabs to your ACT! screen. For
example, the ACT! QuickBooks link draws information from QuickBooks and
plops it into a brand new tab called QuickBooks.
Getting Help When You Need It
In addition to the information that I provide in this book, ACT! 2005 comes
with a very good — and quite extensive — online Help system that supplies
step-by-step instructions for just about any ACT! feature that you might want
to explore.
You can access the ACT! online Help system in one of two ways:
 Press the F1 key on your keyboard.
 Choose Help from any ACT! menu bar.
When you access ACT!’s Help menu, you’re treated to several options. All
these Help options provide a wealth of information, and you shouldn’t be
afraid to use them.
 Help Topics: This option supplies you with lots of information based on
the currently open window. Use this option when you find yourself
scratching your head about something and you’ll probably be rewarded
with just the answer you’re looking for.
 “How to Use Help”: This area of help provides you with the most infor-
mation. In fact, you can find so much good information that this section
is further subdivided into three tabbed areas:
• Contents: Think of the Contents tab as the Table of Contents in a
book. The Contents tab presents you with the major topics cov-
ered in ACT!. If you click the plus sign next to each topic, you find a
more detailed listing of the subject.
• Index: As its name implies, the index is just like the index you find
at the back of a book. It provides you with an alphabetical listing of
every feature found in ACT!. You can either scroll through the list
of features or type in the first few letters of the feature that you are
looking for.
• Search: The Search tab provides you with the most in-depth infor-
mation about the various ACT! features. This feature is particularly
helpful if you aren’t sure of the exact name of the feature that
you’re trying to find. For example, you may be looking for instruc-
tions on how to force a field to display only capital letters. A
25
Chapter 2: The Various Faces of ACT!

search of the Index tab doesn’t help you (the feature is actually
called Initial Capitalization), but you can find the information by
typing capital in the Search tab. Figure 2-4 gives you an idea of all
the help you can find in the Search window.
 Online Manuals: ACT! comes with two nifty PDF files. One is a Quick
Reference card that you can print to help you with the most common of
ACT! features. The other is a rather large document that you can refer 
to — or print — when you need extra help.
 Getting Started Wizard: In your zealous haste to start working with
ACT!, you might have chosen to ignore the wizard that pops up immedi-
ately after you first fire up ACT!. The Getting Started Wizard insures that
your word processor and e-mail preferences are set correctly and help
you to either convert an existing database or create a new one.
 ACT! Update: As much as you may want to think that the software you
purchase is perfect in every way, it’s not. Very often, users like you dis-
cover “bugs” or little errors in the software. Sometimes, major changes
such as the release of a new operating system may cause your software
to exhibit some bad behavior. An update patch generally corrects these
problems. The ACT! update insures that you have the latest and greatest
release of ACT!; best of all, there is no charge for this service!
 Service and Support: Ever wonder how to find help when you really
need it? Three great options can provide a bit of extra handholding:
• Contact information: Includes a link to the various fee-based sup-
port options offered by Best Software.
• Knowledge Base: Includes articles written by ACT!’s tech support
about commonly asked questions and procedures.
• ACT! Consulting: Most of you know a brother, buddy, or colleague
that “knows” ACT!. As the old saying goes, a little knowledge is a
dangerous thing. In reality, these well-intentioned folks probably
know ACT! as it pertains to their business — not yours. Unless
they are earning a living by consulting in the ACT! program, they
are probably not your best source for accurate information.
Your best source of help for ACT! is the ACT! Certified Consultant.
These consultants (or ACCs) earn their livelihood by working with
people like you. They are certified ACT! fanACTics who spend a
great portion of their day working with any and all things ACT!.
They can help you with anything from converting to ACT! from
another program and customizing your database to training your
employees. Most ACCs even make house calls. Clicking the ACT!
Consulting option takes you for a field trip out to an Internet site
that contains a listing of all the local ACT! consultants.

Getting Your ACT! Together
In This Chapter
 Creating a new database
 Adding new users to your database
 Changing the ACT! preferences
 Customizing your toolbars and menus
I
could easily have titled this chapter “Have It Your Way” because here’s
where I show you how to set up a new database and add a couple of users
to it. You discover some of the preference settings that you can change in
ACT!, especially if you’re sharing your database across a network. Finally, 
if you’re a real power user, you’ll be excited to know how to change your
menus and toolbars.
Creating a New ACT! Database
If your initial meeting with ACT! entailed looking at the Act7demo database
that comes with ACT!, you know that it’s a great database to use for learning
purposes before actually starting to work on your own database. After playing
with the demo for only a short time, you’re probably eager to start working on
your very own database. The easiest way to create your first database is by
using the Getting Started Wizard. In addition to setting you up with a new
database, the wizard helps you to set a few of the most basic preferences
needed for ACT! to work correctly.
Follow these steps to set up your new ACT! database with the Getting Started
Wizard:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Help➪Getting Started Wizard.
The first of the five Getting Started Wizard screens appears.
At this point, feel free to put your feet up on the desk, answer a few
questions, and let ACT! do the grunt work for you.

2. On the wizard’s introductory screen, click Next to get started.
Quick as a flash, the Getting Started Wizard - Word Processor screen
appears. Here’s where you get to choose your word processor. It’s an
either/or proposition; you have only two choices (see the next step).
3. Choose Microsoft Word (if Word is installed on your computer); other-
wise, choose the ACT! word processor. Click Next.
In the next screen, you get to tell ACT! which e-mail client you’re using.
(For information on determining which e-mail client you need to be
using, scurry over to Chapter 14.)
4. Select the e-mail program of your choice and then click Next.
If you prefer, you can even tell ACT! that you prefer to skip the e-mail
setup for now.
By now, I’m sure you realize running a wizard means clicking the Next
button a lot. Smart reader! However, the next step in the wizard gets a
wee bit more challenging because you have to decide to either create a
new database, convert an existing database from a prior version of ACT!
into ACT! 2005 format, or to just skip the database setup. I’ve made the
assumption that you are setting up a brand new ACT! database; that’s
the direction the steps take.
5. Select Set Up Database Now and then click Next.
In this step of the Getting Started Wizard, you get to make a couple of
decisions about the future of your database as you can see in Figure 3-1.
• Database Name: You might want to give the database a really cool
moniker, such as the name of your company, so that you can easily
identify it later. 
Figure 3-1:
Setting up a
new ACT!
database.
30
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

• Location: By default, the database is saved to the default database
folder. Unless you change that preference, the default location is
C:\My Documents\ACT\ACT for Win 7\Database. You also can
indicate whether you want to share this database with other
people with whom you might be networked.
• User Name: Most of the time the person setting up the database is
also one of the database administrators. Keeping this is mind, indi-
cate the name of the database administrator.
• Password: The good news is that as you type your password, each
letter appears on-screen as an asterisk just in case someone is lurk-
ing over your shoulder trying to nab your password. The bad news
is that because you can’t see what you’re typing, you might just
type something you didn’t intend to. ACT! demands that you retype
your password to ensure that you didn’t misspeak the first time.
6. Fill in the appropriate information and then click Next.
The final screen of the Getting Started Wizard appears, recapping all the
important decisions that you just made about your new database. If you
made a mistake or simply changed your mind, now’s the time to click
the Back button and fix things!
7. Double-check your answers carefully, make the appropriate changes
(if any), and then click Finish.
If you need to create another database, simply repeat the wizard or check out
the next section, where I show you how to make a copy of an existing data-
base. When you’re ready to add contacts to the database, head to Chapter 4.
If you have already set your preferences, you don’t need to use the wizard to
create a new, blank database. Just do the following:
1. Choose File➪New Database from any of the ACT! views.
The New Database dialog box appears. By coincidence, it is identical 
to the New Database screen of the Getting Started Wizard (refer to
Figure 3-1).
2. Fill in the database name, location, user name, and password, and
then click OK.
Copying an Existing Database
Each time you create a new database by using either the Getting Started
Wizard or by choosing File➪New Database you are creating a new, pristine
database based on ACT!’s original “out of the box” fields. After you use ACT!
for a while, you might want to create a new database based on a database
that you or someone else has customized.
31
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

If you make an exact copy of your database, you want to be careful how you
use it. If you merely want to place a database on another computer for refer-
ence, making an exact copy by following these steps is fine. However, if your
intention is to create a database for a remote user for purposes of synchro-
nization, read Chapter 18 to find out how to create a database for a remote
user. If you’re creating a copy of a database for backup purposes, check out
Chapter 17, where I show you how to create an ACT! backup.
1. Choose File➪Save Copy As from any of the ACT! views.
The Save Copy As dialog box opens (see Figure 3-2), where you decide
what type of database you want to create.
2. Type a name for the copy of the database.
Do not make the mistake of assigning the same name to the new data-
base that you have already used for your existing database. Even if you
save the database copy to an entirely new location, there’s a good
chance that you’ll accidentally use the “wrong” database. By default,
whenever you open ACT!, it opens the last database that you used;
ACT!’s title bar tells you the name of the currently opened database but
not its path. If two databases have the same filename, you may end up
working in the incorrect database — without even realizing it.
3. Specify the location for the new database.
By default, the new database is saved to C:\My Documents\ ACT for
Win 7\Databases. You can also indicate whether you want to share the
database.
Figure 3-2:
Creating a
copy of a
database.
32
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

4. Specify the type of database you’re creating.
Although creating a copy of your existing database is easy, you must
understand the consequence of your decision at this point. Consider
your choices:
• Create a Copy of the Database: This option creates an exact replica
of your currently opened database. After you create a new ACT!
database and customize it by adding many new fields, you may
want to duplicate it for use by other offices or for other businesses
that you might own. The new database copies the field structure of
your existing database as well as all the actual contact records
within the database.
• Create an Empty Copy of the Database: This option creates a
blank database that contains all the customized fields that you cre-
ated in your existing database, but it does not contain any of the
contact records from your original database.
5. Click OK.
A dialog box appears asking you to insert the name of the primary user
of the database, as shown in Figure 3-3.
6. Fill in the user name and password for the primary user of the 
database.
As you see in Figure 3-3, you’re also given an option to select a name
from the current database, which is what you want to do if the primary
user is already one of the contacts in the database that you are copying.
You are now ready to start entering contact records into your new data-
base. Chapter 4 contains the details about adding contact records to a
database.
Figure 3-3:

33
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

Adding Multiple Users to a Database
A Record Manager is a contact in your database who is also a user of your data-
base. If several people are entering data into your ACT! database, I highly rec-
ommend setting up each person as a Record Manager. If you and Jane are both
set up as users of the database, you need to make sure that you log in as you
and Jane logs in as herself. ACT! automatically enters several key pieces of
information based on the way that you log into the database. For example,
you’re recognized as the record creator of each new contact you add to the
database. Likewise, if Jane enters a note, that note is associated with her name.
If you generate a document from one of ACT!’s templates, your name — not
Jane’s — appears as the generator of that document. Most importantly, your
name is associated with any meetings, calls, or to-do’s that you schedule in
ACT!. Having unique, identifiable users in a database allows you to view your
own activities on a calendar. Otherwise, you might find yourself driving to
Podunk to visit Jane’s mom on her birthday!
Only the database administrator has permission to add new users to the ACT!
database.
To add a new user to your database, follow these steps:
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose Tools➪Manage Users.
The User Management dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
Adding 
a new
database
user.
34
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

2. Click Create New User.
In the next window that appears, you are given a choice to create the
new user from an existing contact, or to create a brand new user who
isn’t currently a member of your current database. In earlier versions of
ACT! this option was buried away, often resulting in an “evil twin” situa-
tion in that although you only know one John Smith, he is represented
twice in your database — once as a user and the other time as simply a
member of your database.
3. Choose either Existing Contact or New Contact and click Next.
If you chose the Existing Contact option, you see a list of all the contacts
in your database. You can sort the list alphabetically by either contact
or company by clicking the corresponding column heading. After you
sort the list, type in the first couple of letter of the contact’s last name 
or company (depending on how you sorted the list) in the Look For text
box and ACT! magically takes you to that name. Click Next to continue.
If you chose the New Contact option, a dialog box opens that is similar
to the User Management dialog box. (Refer to Figure 3-4.)
4. If the new user you added is also new to your database, you need to
type in his/her name.
If you already indicated the name of the user in Step 3, his/her name is
sitting there waiting for you.
5. Fill in the user name.
The user name is not case-sensitive. Just make sure you remember what
name you decide on. If you are setting up multiple users for the same data-
base you just might want to stick to a set naming convention: “Gary Kahn”
or “gkahn” are good choices; you might want to avoid “Gary B. Kahn” or
“Gary Kahn, Esq.”
6. Fill in the password.
By now you know the drill: You type in the password once, and because
that was so much fun, you type it a second time.
7. Choose the security role of the new user.
ACT! provides you with five levels of security, and because you are the
Administrator, you set those levels for all subsequent users.
• Browse: This user has the most limited role; he or she can view
contacts, view calendars, and add activities. The Browse user
cannot add, modify, or delete contacts; or modify or add any other
data. 
The Browse role is typically assigned to users who need to look up
calendar details and schedule activities. In the real world, the data-
base administrator typically assigns a user Browse level access if
he has serious doubts as to the user’s ability to add data.
35
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

• Restricted: This role allows users to access only areas of the appli-
cation to which he or she is granted permission. The Restricted
role is typically assigned to users working in a support capacity or
acting in a Standard or Manager role. A Restricted user can access
all data that he or she creates but cannot delete any data, even if
he or she created it. This role also doesn’t allow users to create
companies or groups.
• Standard: A Standard user is the default user role assigned to new
users. The Standard user can see the records in a database that he
creates or is given explicit access to. Standard users can add,
delete, and modify records; and synchronize data. What a standard
user cannot do is add new users to the database, perform database
maintenance, back up the database, import and export data, or
modify database fields and layouts.
• Manager: A Manager role is the second most powerful user role.
Typically Managers are people, such as sales managers, who
manage the various users of the database and control the types of
data that is entered into the database. Managers generally don’t
have the time — or sometime the technical knowledge — to use
the various maintenance tools that I describe in Chapter 17. The
manager can access nearly all the areas of ACT! except for data-
base maintenance and user management. The manager is also
restricted from viewing, editing, or deleting the private records of
other individuals.
• Administrator: The Administrator can perform any database func-
tion and is the chief, the head honcho, the Big Guy — the person
everyone blames if something goes wrong with the database. When
a user creates a database, he or she is automatically assigned the
Administrator role. This role is the most powerful role in ACT! with
access to all areas of the application and all data in the supplemen-
tal files folders. The only thing the Administrator can’t do is access,
edit, or delete records marked as private by another user and get
out of speeding tickets when caught doing 50 in a 35 mph zone.
Be sure to note which users you give the Administrator user level.
These users are the only ones who can add users, create a backup,
and perform routine maintenance on the database.
Assigning two users as Administrators of the database is always a
good idea. Not only do two people feel extra special, it can save your
little rear end. As hard as it might be to believe, the Administrator
may leave the company suddenly, and without warning — taking the
keys for the rest room and the password for the database with him.
This means you might not be able to access the database, to per-
form routine maintenance, add users, or make field changes. You
may also find yourself looking for a new job. Remember: No pass-
word, no entry!

8. Select the Active check box.
This option enables the new user to access your database. If, for some
reason, you do not want a user to have access to your database, feel free
to clear this check box. I show you how to delete and disable (but hope-
fully not maim!) your database users later in this chapter.
9. Select additional options that the user might be able to access.
• Allow user to synchronize with handheld devices
• Allow user to perform Accounting link tasks
10. Click Finish.
Deleting Login Users
After you master adding new users to your database, you need to know how
to delete users when they leave. After all, easy come, easy go. The first thing
that you need to do is to determine whether you’re going to actually delete
the user or just deny him or her access to the database. There is a slight 
difference.
If you are the database administrator and you simply want to stop someone
from accessing the database, you can do so without having to actually delete
that person as a user. You can simply shut off her login privileges (a very
simple process).
One of the reasons why you add users to the database is so that they can per-
form various functions, such as scheduling appointments and creating notes.
The user’s name is also associated with any contact that he may create. Opting
to shut off a user’s login privileges, rather than delete that user entirely, elimi-
nates the possibility of losing this information. Here’s how you shut off a user’s
access to the database:
1. Choose Tools➪Manage Users.
The User Management dialog box opens (refer to Figure 3-4).
2. Select the name of the user for whom you wish to change the access
rights.
3. Click Edit User.
4. Click Next to bypass the Password window.
If you’re removing a user’s ability to log in to the database, he no longer
can use a password.
5. Select Inactive and then click Finish.
37
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

If you are using ACT! 2005 Standard Edition, you are limited to ten active
users. When someone is no longer working at your company — or no longer
needs access to the database — make sure you change the user information
to reflect his or her inactive status.
Some of you are still determined to permanently erase all traces of past users
from both your database and your mind. The only users you can safely remove
from your database are those users who never added contacts, activities,
notes, or histories. You might also have other users who no longer need to be
associated with specific contacts, activities, notes, or histories. ACT!, being the
smart program that you’ve grown to know and love, allows you to delete a user
while preserving the information (notes, histories, and so on) associated with
him by reassigning those items to another user.
Follow these steps to remove a user from your database:
1. Choose Tools➪Manage Users from any ACT! view.
The User Management dialog box appears (refer to Figure 3-4).
2. Select the name of the user who you want to remove from your 
database.
3. Click Delete User.
A dialog box appears giving you two options:
• Delete Records Belonging to This User: If you choose this option,
you are in essence saying adios to all contact records and associ-
ated data including notes and history — no matter who entered
that data.
• Reassign Records to Another User: Although you retain all the
contacts, notes, histories, and activities created by the user, the
other user’s name is now assigned to them.
ACT! searches through your database and reassigns every record, note,
and contact one at a time. This time may be good to perfect the art of
thumb twiddling; the larger your database, the longer reassigning takes.
After you reassign contact records to a new user, you can’t reverse the
process. From here on, the notes, histories, and contacts that the deleted
user created appear to have been created by the new user. However, if you
simply delete a user without reassigning his records, you risk losing a lot of
contact information. If you don’t want that to happen, I recommend simply
removing the former user’s login privileges.
Rather than deleting a user of your database, you might also consider chang-
ing the Record Manager field for all contacts that are now associated with the
new user. Skip over to Chapter 17 to find out how you can change the field
data for a whole bunch of contacts at once.
38
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Working with Passwords
If you’re the only user using your ACT! database, or if your clients love you
and would chop their arms off at the wrist before turning to one of your com-
petitors, security might not be an important issue for you. But if you’re like
most people, you probably prefer not to share every tidbit of information in
your database with anyone who wanders into your office. Whether you want
to prevent certain personnel from changing the basic field structure of your
database or adapt a “look but don’t touch” attitude with the unfortunate
computer-challenged among your employees, ACT! has two security methods
that can help you accomplish your security goals. You can either
 Assign a specific security level to each user as I discuss earlier in the
section, “Adding Multiple Users to a Database.”
 Password-protect your database; I discuss this option throughout the
rest of this section.
Unless a contact record is marked as private, ACT! 2005 Standard Edition 
has no way of allowing someone access to only a portion of the contacts in 
a database. If you want to limit the contacts a particular user sees, you have
a couple of options. You can upgrade to ACT! 2005 Premium Edition, which
allows access to user records, based on your “team” preferences. You can
also supply the user with his own database and synchronize just those con-
tacts that he has access to from the main database as I show in Chapter 18.
Setting a password
Both the database administrator and the individual database user can set a
password for the user. The theory for this is that the individual can pick a pass-
word that has some meaning to him — and so, hopefully, he doesn’t forget it. (If
a user does forget his password, however, the administrator can reset it.)
If you have access to a database and are afraid that some nasty person might
use your name to gain access illegally, I recommend assigning a password to
yourself, which is ridiculously easy. Here’s what you do:
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose File➪Set Password.
The Change Password dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Enter your current password in the Current Password text box.
3. Type your new password in the New Password text box and then for
added excitement type, it once more in the Confirm New Password
text box.
4. Click OK.
39
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

Resetting a password
You might not know your password because you don’t have one, so before
tracking down your administrator to change a password for you, try leaving
the password field blank. (I frequently get phone calls and e-mails from ACT!
users who have no idea what password is assigned to them. Guess what?
They often don’t have one!)
But if you’ve tried every password that you can think of — and even have
tried using no password at all — and still can’t gain access to the database,
you might have to bribe the database Administrator into resetting your pass-
word. I find that chocolate chip cookies work the best, but feel free to pick the
bribe of your choice. Then, make sure the Administrator follows these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Manage Users.
2. Select the name of the user whose password is being changed and
then click Edit User.
3. Type in the new password in the text box and then retype it in the
Confirm Password dialog box.
4. Click Finish.
Changing a password
From time to time, you might want to change your password. Perhaps you
feel that a former employee compromised your security, or maybe you’ve
just been watching too many James Bond movies. Whatever the case, remem-
ber the new, improved password, or you may be forced to chase the database
administrator around with another batch of cookies!
1. Choose File➪Set Password from any ACT! view.
If you’re going through this chapter section by section, you already
know that you can do this from within any of the ACT! screens. I don’t
mean to sound like a broken record here; I just want you to get used to
the idea.

2. Enter the current password in the Current Password text box.
3. Enter the new password in the New Password text box.
4. Enter the new password in the Confirm New Password text box.
5. Click OK.
Giving ACT! the Preferential Treatment
After you install ACT! on your computer, becoming familiar with various pref-
erences is a good practice. If you’re the sole user of the database, these set-
tings likely save your sanity. If you share the database with other users, these
settings probably save you all a lot of head scratching.
If you created your original database by using the Getting Started Wizard,
some of your preferences are already set. However, reviewing your work
never hurts! Your preference settings are the place to turn to if you’re the
kind of person who likes to have things your own way. You might routinely
store all your documents in a specific location and want ACT! to follow that
same example. Or you might have a fondness for fuchsia and orange and
want to have your ACT! screens coordinate with this color scheme.
Here’s how to change several of the most basic preference settings. Feel free 
to flip through the various preference tabs to get an idea about additional 
preference settings that you might also want to tweak. You can find the ACT!
Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-6, by choosing Tools➪Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box is arranged into six tabs, each of which I discuss in
the following sections.
General
As the name implies, you find an assortment of preferences on the General tab.
General preferences allow you to specify settings for your database, such as
how names and salutations display on your contact records, whether checking
for duplicate records is enabled or disabled, and where files associated with
your database are stored. ACT! automatically stores your database in the My
Documents folder. Your database contains all your basic contact information 
as well as supplemental files such as layouts, templates, and saved e-mail mes-
sages. In addition, you might want to have your own set of “personal” supple-
mental files; this area is where you can tell ACT! where you prefer to have them
saved.
If you’re not the Administrator, you can’t change the history or duplicate
checking options.
41
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

Colors & Fonts
You can set the colors and fonts for almost any area of ACT! including all list
views, tabs, and calendars. However, there isn’t a global color setting; you
must set the colors and fonts for each item separately in the Colors & Fonts
tab, as shown in Figure 3-7. To set colors and fonts, follow these steps:
1. On the Colors & Fonts tab, select an item to customize from the
Customize list.
In the Customize list, you find a list of all the lists, calendars, and system
tabs. You’ll also notice in Figure 3-7 several items in the list with the
words “detail composition;” these indicate areas in ACT! in which you
can write in extra details when necessary.
2. In the Appearance section, select the text and background color for
the item you selected on the Customize list.
3. Click the Font button.
The Font dialog box appears.
4. Select the font, style, and size of the font.
5. Click OK.
6. To change the appearance of another item, select the item from the
Customize list, and repeat Steps 2 through 5.
7. Click OK to save your color preferences.

Calendars & Scheduling
The Calendars & Scheduling tab is nothing more than a gateway to the heart
of the matter: changing the calendar and scheduling preferences.
When you click the Calendar Preferences button, you can set
 The days of the week you want to appear on your “work week” calendar
 The minute intervals for your daily and workweek calendars
 Various calendar options, such as whether or not you want to see “pop
ups” when you hold your mouse cursor over a scheduled activity
 How you want to banner all-day events
When you click the Scheduling Preferences button, you can get the Activity
Type Settings dialog box. From this dialog box, you select the activity type
for which you want to set options. You can set options for each activity type,
but you must set the options one activity type at a time. The options you can
include for each activity type are
 The priority level you want to display automatically when the activity
type is scheduled
 How long before the activity you want the Ring Alarm to ring for the
activity type
 The default duration for the activity type
 The fields for which you want to display drop-downs lists for the activity
type

Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

E-mail
Exactly as advertised, the E-mail preference tab is the area where you tell
ACT! exactly how you want to handle your e-mail. The preferences you might
want to set include
 The e-mail system you want to use with ACT!: Microsoft Outlook,
Outlook Express, or Internet Mail
 Composing options including signatures, dealing with forwarded and
replied messages, and even how you want the recipients name to appear
when composing a new e-mail message
 How often you want ACT! to notify you about newly received messages
 How you want to handle attachments that you receive
Communication
The Communications tab lets you choose your word processor and fax pref-
erences including
 The word processing and fax software you want to use with ACT!
 How you want ACT! to check your spelling in e-mail messages and word
processing documents
 The Quick Print header and footer options when printing the Company,
Group, Opportunity, and Contact lists
Startup
The Startup options dictate both the default settings for each new contact
added to your database and how ACT! starts up every time you run the 
program.
 The Record Creation setting lets you set the default to Public or Private
for each new contact, group, and opportunity you add to the database,
and whether you want to automatically link each new contact to their
company record.
 Startup Database lets you specify the database you want ACT! to open
automatically as well as how often you want ACT! to check for new soft-
ware updates.

Part I: The Opening ACT! 

Customizing the Navigation Bar
One of the things you might find the most endearing about ACT! is your ability
to mold the program to the way that feels the most comfortable to you. You
might decide that for whatever reason you don’t like the way the Navigation
bar look (those big icons that run down the left side of ACT!). No problem —
all you have to do to have it “your way” is follow the next few steps:
1. Right-click the Navigation bar.
Note the menu that appears is divided into three sections. You actually
get to choose one option from both the top and middle sections.
2. Chose from the following options:
• Large: That’s the size of the Nav bar icons when you first install
ACT!.
• Small: If you’re working on a small monitor — or just want to have
a little more viewing room, you might want the Nav bar icons to be
small so the rest of your screen can be larger.
• Standard: The Nav bar shows you eight of the most common views.
• Expanded: For those of you who live for detail, the Nav bar shows
you 14 icons; you might want to set the size to small so that you
don’t have to scroll through all those options.
• Classic: For those of you loyal ACT! fanACTics who want things,
well, like you’re used to seeing them, here’s your chance to have
the Nav bar look “just like it used to.”
• Customize: Just in case you’re still not happy with the look and
feel of the Nav bar, feel free to choose the Customize option. A little
window magically opens that allows you to drag additional icons
to the Nav bar — or get rid of the ones you don’t want.
Modifying Menus and Toolbars
Customizing the various ACT! menus and toolbars to include functions that
you use on a regular basis is a great way to improve your efficiency. Tweaking
your toolbar literally allows you to perform various functions at the click of a
button.
45
Chapter 3: Getting Your ACT! Together

Tackling the toolbar
One thing you might find a little unique in ACT! is the variety of toolbars that
you encounter along the way. You see one toolbar while working in the
Contact Detail window, and an altogether different toolbar when you foray
into the Group Detail window. That said, realize that an icon you add to one
of your toolbars doesn’t appear on another. That’s okay because adding
icons to any one of the ACT! toolbars is easy.
I encourage you to do a little homework before tackling the toolbar. Don’t
worry, the assignment is fairly simply; you need to decide in advance which
icon you want to add, and know which menu it’s located on. Although this
step isn’t critical, it saves you from floundering around later. Follow these
steps to add an icon to any toolbar:
1. From any of the ACT! screens, choose Tools➪Customize➪Menus and
Toolbars.
For the right-clickers in the audience, you can also give the toolbar a
click with the right button of your mouse and choose Customize.
2. Click the Commands tab in the Customize Menus and Toolbars 
dialog box.
The Commands tab appears in the Customize Menus and Toolbars
dialog box (see Figure 3-8).
Figure 3-8:
Customizing
the ACT!
toolbar.
46
Part I: The Opening ACT! 

3. Select the name of the menu that contains the command that you want
to add to your toolbar.
If you did your homework, pat yourself on the back. If you didn’t, have fun
flipping through all the choices in the Categories list and scrolling through
all the corresponding commands until you stumble upon the item that
you want to add to the toolbar. I hate to be an “I told you so,” but. . . .
4. Drag the desired command up to the toolbar.
As you drag the command up to the toolbar, a black line materializes
that indicates exactly where the icon is going to appear. If you want the
new icon to be on the end of the toolbar, you need to drag it up so that it
slightly overlaps the last item currently located on the toolbar.
5. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog
box.
Deleting toolbar icons
I’m almost embarrassed to tell you how easy you can remove icons from a
toolbar. But, because you’re such a good person I am going to tell you. You
might store this information away for future reference and use it to impress
your friends some time in the near future.
1. Right-click the toolbar and choose Customize.
By the way, customize is not only the choice you want to choose — it’s
your only choice!
2. Right-click the icon that you want to send packing.
3. Click Delete.
4. Click the Close button on the Customize Menus and Toolbars dialog
box.

Putting the ACT!
Database to Work

In this part . . .
O
kay, you’ve whipped ACT! into shape; now it’s time
to get your life back in order. ACT! is a contact man-
ager, which, as the name implies, makes it a great place to
manage your contacts. First you must add new contacts
into your database, and then you need to know how to
ﬁnd them again. After you locate your contacts, you can
schedule an activity with any one of them, set a reminder,
and maybe add some notes for good measure. Sure beats
the heck out of a yellow sticky note!

Chapter 4
Making Contact(s)
In This Chapter
 Adding new contacts
 Editing contact information
 Deleting contacts
 Updating contact information
A
database is only as good as the contacts that it contains. In ACT!,
adding, deleting, and editing the contacts in your database is easy to
do. In this chapter, I show you how to do all three of these tasks to maintain
an organized, working database. Adding new contacts is only half the fun;
being able to find them again is the point of having the database in the first
place. Inputting contacts in a consistent manner ensures that all your con-
tacts are easy to find. After you add a new contact, you may need to change
that contact’s information or even delete the contact entirely. I demonstrate
how to change contact information if necessary and even how to “unchange”
changes that you might have made by mistake!
Adding New Contacts
On the very simplest level, the main purpose of ACT! is to serve as a place to
store all the contacts that you interact with on a daily basis. You can add and
edit your contacts from the Contact Detail window because it contains all the
information that pertains to one particular record and allows you to see all
your contact fields.
Every time that you add a new contact, ACT! automatically fills information in
three fields: Record Creator, Record Manager, and Create Date. If you click the
Contact Info tab of your layout, you’ll notice these three fields. When you add a
new contact, ACT! inserts your user name into the Record Creator and Record
Manager fields and the current date into the Create Date field. This tab enables
you to search for all the new contacts that you created within a given date
range. The Record Creator and Create Date fields serve as a permanent record,
and you cannot change them. Managers and Administrators can override the
contents of the Record Manager field if they so desire.

You probably have lots of contacts that you’re dying to enter into your data-
base, so what are you waiting for? Jump right in and follow these steps:
1. If you aren’t already in the Contact Detail window, go there by click-
ing the Contacts icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
Don’t know about the Nav bar? Check out Chapter 2, where you find out
all you need to know about the Nav bar and then some.
2. In the Contact Detail window, choose from one of three ways to add a
new contact to your database:
• Choose Contact➪New Contact.
• Click the New Contact icon on the toolbar.
• Press the Insert key on the keyboard.
Initiating any of the preceding commands results in a blank contact
record. You’re now ready to enter the new contact’s information.
3. Begin entering information by clicking in the Company field and
typing the contact’s company name.
ACT! doesn’t distinguish between actual contacts and blank contacts.
Failure to enter information or repeatedly pressing the Insert key results
in numerous blank contact records, which are of no use and only serve to
clog up the database. So, although you are free to leave any of the ACT!
fields blank, you do have to enter something — at the very least, I recom-
mend the key pieces of information — so you might as well begin with
the company’s name.
You can always go back to a record later and add, change, or delete any
information in any field. See the later sections “The Contacts, They Are
A’Changin’” and “Deleting Contact Records.”
4. Click in the next field where you want to enter information and start
typing.
You can also use the Tab key to advance to the next field. If, in your ini-
tial excitement to start entering all your existing contacts, you inadver-
tently press the Tab key once too often, you may find that you advanced
one too many fields and ended up in the wrong field. But don’t fret:
Press and hold down the Shift key and then press Tab to move your
cursor in the reverse direction.
5. Continue filling in fields.
As I mention in Chapter 2, ACT! comes with approximately 50 pre-
programmed fields that reflect the needs of most users. Many of the fields
are fairly self-explanatory (and reflect the type of information that you
probably expect to find in any address book): contact name, company
name, phone, city, state, and zip code. These are conveniently located
in the top half of the Contact Detail window; see Figure 4-1. A few of the
fields are a little less obvious:
52
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

• Address: If you assume that the three fields ACT! provides for the
address is meant to store three alternative addresses, you’re
wrong! The second and third address fields are meant for really
long addresses. This field is a good place to include a building
name if it is an integral part of the address.
5160-style labels, popularly used for mass mailings, generally print
four lines of information: company, contact, street address, and
city/state/zip code (all on the fourth line). If you need to use the
second and third address fields, you need larger labels.
• ID/Status: The ID/Status field is essentially the category field, and
it files each of your contacts into categories. By using the ID/Status
field, you don’t have to manually set up a variety of databases: one
for your friends, one for your clients, one for your vendors, and so
on. The ID/Status field comes preset with a couple dozen of the
most commonly used categories, including friends, customers,
vendors, and competitors, which makes searching for each of
these categories in a flash easy.
• Salutation: This field refers to the name that comes after the word
Dear in a letter, which is used in your letter templates. By default,
ACT!, being the friendly type, uses the first name. Feel free to
change the salutation to a more formal one.
Figure 4-1:
The Contact
Detail
window.
53
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

If you prefer using the more formal salutation as the default set-
ting, choose Tools➪Preferences and click the Salutation
Preferences button conveniently located on the General tab.
• Referred By: This field is one of the most commonly overlooked
ones in the database. Information entered into this field is used in
the Source of Referrals report; failure to enter Referred By informa-
tion renders the report useless. So what’s the big deal? Suppose
you’re paying for advertising in two newspapers — wouldn’t know-
ing which one attracted the most prospects be nice? If you’re
attending trade shows or putting a lot of time and effort into your
Web site, wouldn’t you like to know if it has resulted in any new
business? And, if an existing customer is sending you lots of new
leads, wouldn’t honoring him with a nice ham at Christmas rather
than the customary fruitcake be nice?
• User: Notice that several User fields are in the bottom half of the
Contact Detail window (refer to Figure 4-1). These fields hold infor-
mation that’s specific to your business. In Chapter 15, I explain how
you can change these field names to better reflect their contents.
For example, you might rename User 1 to Social Security number.
I recommend leaving these particular fields blank until you rename
them. If you don’t, you might end up with various kinds of data
entered into one field.
You can always go back and add, change, or delete field data at any
time! (See the sections “Deleting Contact Records” and “The
Contacts, They Are A’Changin’” later in this chapter.)
6. Don’t be alarmed when ACT! automatically formats some of your field
data when you enter information.
See the later section, “Letting ACT! do the work for you: Automatic for-
matting,” for the lowdown on what ACT! does and doesn’t do for you.
7. Add your data as uniformly as possible.
Check out the later section, “Getting the most out of ACT!: Using the
drop-down lists,” to find out how to easily keep your data uniform and
yourself sane.
8. If necessary, add multiple entries to a field.
Generally, limiting yourself to one item per field is the best practice.
From time to time, however, you find a situation in which a contact falls
into two categories. For example, JoAnne Chamar might be both a friend
and a client. In this situation, you can use the drop-down list to enter
more than one item into a field.
To select several criteria to be included in a single field, follow these steps:
a. Place your cursor in the field.
b. Check off your desired selections.
Figure 4-2 gives you an example of a drop-down list.
54
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

c. Click the desired entries from the Edit List Values dialog box.
d. Click anywhere outside of the dialog box to close it.
The various entries appear in the field, separated by a comma. 
9. When you fill in the information for each new contact, don’t forget to
click the various tabs at the bottom of your layout.
You find additional fields lurking on these tabs. The Home Address tab is
the place you record personal information about a contact. You might
have a few other tabs that you can also choose from (see Chapter 16).
Different layouts display different tabs. If you change your current
layout, you’re probably looking at a different set of tabs. Confused?
Check out Chapter 2 for a quick refresher.
If you forget to click those tabs along the bottom of the Contact Detail
window, you just might overlook some of the fields that you need to fill
in important information. So be sure to click those tabs!
10. Save the new contact information.
Theoretically, you don’t have to save new contact information; it’s saved
if you do any of the following:
• Execute any other ACT! command, which includes anything from
adding a note or sales opportunity to scheduling an appointment.
• Move on to another record in the database.
• Click the Save button (represented by the small floppy disk icon on
the toolbar).
• Press Ctrl+S.

Entering a new contact into the ACT! database is so easy that you may over-
look some of the magical things that happen when you begin to input contact

Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

information. ACT! is here to help by automatically formatting some of the
contact information that you input, including
 Automatic phone number formatting: A great example of ACT!’s magic
is found in the Phone field. When you type in a phone number, notice
how ACT! automatically inserts the necessary hyphens. ACT! automati-
cally inserts the dialing format for the United States each time that you
enter a new phone number. Have relatives living in Turkmenistan? Have
no fear: If you click the ellipsis button (the two little dots) to the right of
the Telephone field, ACT! pops open the Enter Phone Number dialog
box. By default, the country is listed as the United States, but you can
scroll through the list of the countries for just about any country that
you can think of, including Turkmenistan (see Figure 4-3). After you click
OK, the correct telephone country code and format is applied to the
telephone number.
 Automatic name formatting: Another field that ACT! automatically pro-
vides you with is the Salutation field. The Salutation field is the field that
appears after the word Dear in a letter. If you enter Mary Ellen Van der
Snob as the contact name, Mary Ellen magically appears as the saluta-
tion. Of course, if you prefer to address your contacts in a more formal
manner, feel free to change Mary Ellen to Ms. Van der Snob. When you
enter a contact name into the database, ACT! automatically divides it
into a first, middle, and last name. Again, if you click the ellipsis button
to the right of the Contact field, ACT! shows you how it plans to divide
the contact’s name. This allows you to sort your database alphabetically
by last name or to look up a contact by first name. If you attempt to
enter a rather large, unique name, ACT! automatically opens the Contact
Name dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4, and asks you how you want to
divide the name.
 History fields: Any changes to a history field results in the information
being preserved on the History tab. Say that you have six steps that you
want your staff to perform when dealing with prospects. You might
change the drop-down information for your history field to reflect those
six steps. When you perform one of the steps and you enter the informa-
tion into the field, the date and time of the change appears on the
History tab so you know exactly when each step took place.
Out of the box, only two fields — ID/Status and Last Results — are his-
tory fields. Theoretically, any field can be a history field, and Chapter 15
shows you how to do it.

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

 Date fields: If you don’t want to forget one thing, it’s the birthday of
your significant other. However, as you discover in Chapter 7, entering
data consistently is important if you have any hope of ever finding it
again. What if an important birthday occurred in January — and you
aren’t sure whether the date had been entered as “January,” “Jan,” “01,”
or “1”? By now you’ve probably guessed that ACT! came up with a cure
for the birthday blues with the addition of date fields. All date fields
have a drop-down arrow; if you click the arrow you actually see a mini-
calendar, as shown in Figure 4-5. Click the appropriate date, buy a card,
and you’re ready to roll. If you prefer, you can also manually enter the
date as “01/17/04” or 1/17/04, and ACT! translates it to the calendar
mode automatically.
Getting the most out of ACT!: 
Using the drop-down lists
One sure-fire way to sabotage your database is to develop new and creative
ways to say the same thing. In Florida, users often vacillate between Fort, Ft,
and Ft. Lauderdale, resulting in a bad sunburn and the inability to correctly
find all their contacts. You’ll notice that several of the ACT! fields contain
drop-down lists. In these fields, you can select an item in the list, or you can
type the first few letters of an item, and the field automatically fills with the
Figure 4-5:
An ACT!
date field.
Figure 4-4:
The Contact
Name
dialog box.
57
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

item that matches what you typed or clicked. When you type an entry that
isn’t in the drop-down list for the Title, Department, City, and Country fields,
the item is automatically added to the list so that you can then select it for
other contacts.
You have two ways of using the drop-down lists to enter information:
 Type the first few letters of an entry that already appears in the drop-
down list, and ACT! completes the word for you. For example, if you type
Ch in the City field, Chicago magically appears.
 Access the drop-down list by clicking its arrow and then choose the
desired item(s) from the list.
Using these drop-down lists whenever possible helps ensure consistency
throughout your database. In Chapter 15, I explain how to add additional
drop-down fields to your database and control how you use them.
If you want to change the content of the drop-down lists that come with ACT!,
follow these steps:
1. Click in a field that has a drop-down list.
2. Click the drop-down arrow in the field.
3. When the drop-down list appears, click the Edit List Values button.
The Edit List Items dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
4. In the Edit List Items dialog box, do one of the following:
• Click the Add button to add an item to the list. A new blank line
appears at the bottom of the list. Enter the text that you want to
appear in the list.
Figure 4-6:
Editing the
drop-down

58
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

• Select an item and click the Delete button to remove it from the
list. Click Yes when ACT! asks you to confirm the deletion.
• To modify an existing item, double-click it and edit it exactly like
you would in a word processor.
5. Click OK when you finish editing your list.
That’s all there is to it. A pretty easy way to ensure consistency, don’t you
think?
Duplicating Your Contacts
As you can see from the “Adding New Contacts” section, entering a new con-
tact into ACT! involves quite a few things. Thankfully, ACT! makes duplicating
a previously saved record easy.
Suppose that you just entered Jane Jones’ contact information, and now you
find yourself looking at a pile of business cards from Jane’s co-workers. All of
them have the same company name and address; the only variables are the
contact name and phone number. ACT! gives you two options for duplicating
contacts. You can either copy the primary information or all the information.
Out of the box, the primary fields are Company, Address 1, Address 2,
Address 3, City, State, Zip, Country, and Fax. When you copy all fields, every
field copies into the new contact record except the Contact and E-Mail
Address fields.
To duplicate contact information without extra typing, follow these steps:
1. Open the record that you want to duplicate.
2. Choose Contact➪Duplicate Contact.
3. Select either the Duplicate Data from Primary Fields or Duplicate Data
from All Fields radio button and then click OK.
A new contact record appears, filled in with the copied information from
the original contact record.
4. Continue creating the contact record by filling in the variable infor-
mation and proceeding as you would with an entirely new contact.
Deleting Contact Records
What do you do if you find that a contact is duplicated in your database? Or
that you’re no longer doing business with one of your contacts? For whatever
reason that you decide that a name no longer needs to be a part of your data-
base, you can just delete that contact record.
59
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

ACT! allows you to either delete one contact record or a lookup of contact
records. (A lookup is the group of contacts that displays after a database
search. Peruse Chapter 7 for more information about lookups.) Just realize
that you are deleting either the current contact that you’re viewing or the
current group of contacts that you just created a query for. When you’re on
the contact that you want to delete, do one of the following:
 Choose Contact➪Delete.
 Press Ctrl+Delete.
 Right-click the contact record and choose Delete Contact.
Any one of these choices brings up the warning shown in Figure 4-7.
If you click the Delete Contact button, you delete the current contact that
you’re viewing. If you click the Delete Lookup button, you delete the current
contact lookup.
Thinking before deleting a contact
Although the procedure is rather simple, you may want to rethink the issue of
deleting contacts. When you delete a contact, you are also deleting all the
associated notes and histories tied to that contact. For example, suppose
that State College is using ACT! to keep track of all prospective students that
it has contacted — or has been contacted by. State College admissions per-
sonnel may receive thousands of inquiries a month and fear that the data-
base will become too large to manage . . . and subsequently think that deleting
all prospects that they haven’t had contact with in over a year is the best
course of action. However, some of those prospects might be attending differ-
ent schools that they aren’t happy with and may want to enter State College as
transfer students. Other prospects may transfer in after completing two years
at a community college, and still others might consider attending State College
as graduate students.
Figure 4-7:

60
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

What to do in such a situation? I’d consider moving the contacts that you no
longer need into another archival database. That way, should the need ever
arise, you can still find all the original information on a contact without
having to start again from scratch. How nice to be able to rekindle a relation-
ship by asking, “So tell me, how did you find the accounting department at
Podunk University?” Although the setup of an archival database is beyond
the scope of this book, an ACT! Certified Consultant can assist you with this
matter.
Three warnings before deleting a contact
Losing contacts in your database is a very scary thought. You undoubtedly
rely very heavily on your ACT! database; losing that data can be potentially
devastating to your business. Worst of all, if you realize that you have just
accidentally removed several — or even hundreds of — contacts from the
database, panic may set in!
Divert this panic by following these tips before you attempt to delete any of
your contacts:
 Know the difference between deleting a contact and deleting a lookup so
that you don’t delete numerous contacts when you only wanted to
delete a single record.
The current contact is the single record that you view from the Contact
Detail window. A lookup is the group of contacts that displays after a
database search.
 Read the warning and make note of the number of contacts that you’re
about to delete. Don’t be afraid to click Cancel if a large number of con-
tacts start to disappear.
 Remember the three rules of computing: backup, backup, backup!
Chapter 17 provides you with instructions on how to create a backup. A
good backup provides the easiest method to restore all your information
after you accidentally deleted it.
The Contacts, They Are A’Changin’
Companies relocate and change their names, people move, and your fingers
sometimes slip on the keyboard. People change e-mail addresses. You might
want to add additional contact information for one of your contacts. All these
predicaments require the editing of contact fields. Not to worry; changing the
information that you store in ACT! is as easy as entering it in the first place.
61
Chapter 4: Making Contact(s)

ACT! gives you two ways of replacing contact information:
 Click in the field that you want to change and then press the Delete or
Backspace key to remove the existing field information. Then simply
type in the new information.
 Highlight all the information in a field. By typing in the new information,
the old information is automatically replaced.
If you accidentally overwrite information in a single ACT! field, press Ctrl+Z 
to undo the changes that you just made to that field — before you move 
your cursor to another ACT! field. For those who are keyboard challenged, 
an alternative is to choose Edit➪Undo from the main menu. After you move
on to another field, neither of these options is available to you.
To undo multiple changes that you’ve made to an ACT! record, choose
Edit➪Undo Changes to Contact before you move on to the next record. 
After you execute another ACT! command or move on to another record,
ACT! automatically saves the record. At that point you can’t automatically
undo any changes you’ve made to a contact record.

A Few Good Tabs and Lists
In This Chapter
 Discovering the lists and tabs
 Customizing the lists and tabs
 Putting secondary contacts in the right place
 Linking documents to the Documents tab
T
hroughout this book, you find all the neat ways in which you can cus-
tomize ACT!. In this chapter, you discover how to change the appearance
of the various ACT! tabs and lists. And, although you encounter numerous
tabs and lists in your travels through ACT!, you’ll soon discover that you can
modify them in exactly the same way.
After you’ve seen one list or tab, you’ve seen them all! And, if you’re a
fanACTic, the lists and tabs work pretty much like they did in previous 
versions.
Meeting the Lists and Tabs
The bad news is that numerous lists and tabs are sprinkled through ACT! and
new users may find themselves lost in a maze of windows. The good news is
that lists and tabs all have pretty much the same look and feel to them, so if
you master one, you master them all!
You can find all lists by clicking View on the menu bar and then selecting a
list that sounds fun and exciting. Two of the lists are so much fun that they
are included in the Nav bar running along the left side of ACT!. And, if you feel
so inclined, you’re welcome to flip back to Chapter 3 to find out how to add
all the list items to the Nav bar.

Here’s a list of the lists you work with most often:
 Contact: Lists all your contacts; the list is filtered based on your current
lookup.
 Task: Lists all the tasks and activities you scheduled for all your con-
tacts; you can filter these by date, type, priority, user, public versus pri-
vate, timeless, cleared status, and Outlook relationship.
 Group: Lists all groups and can optionally include subgroups.
 Company: Lists all companies and can optionally include divisions.
 Opportunities: Lists all the sales opportunities that you enter for all
your contacts; you can filter opportunities by date, status, process,
stage, probability, amount, and public versus private.
There are two types of tabs: system tabs, which are the same for any and all
layouts you use; and user tabs, which you can rename and modify to best fit
the way you work (see Chapter 16). The system tabs you use most often with
ACT! are
 Notes: Lists all notes you record for the current contact, company, or
group; you can filter the notes by date, private versus public, and user.
See Chapter 8 for more on the Notes tab.
 History: Lists all correspondence, activities, and document information
that was recorded automatically by ACT! for a contact, group, or com-
pany; you can filter the histories by date, private versus public, type of
history, and user. Chapter 8 covers the History tab.
64
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 
Minding your filters!
When viewing the various system tabs, you
must be aware of the effect that the filters have
on what information you see — or don’t see. In
ACT!, you can choose to filter out information or
to include it. Different tabs have different filters;
however, all tabs include a date filter and a user
filter. If the filter is set to show only items in the
future, and you have an activity scheduled for
today, you don’t see today’s activity. And, if you
schedule an activity, but you set the filter to
include only Alyssa’s activities, you don’t see
your activity either.
When frustrated, check your filters! You might
be puzzled at the fact that information you just
know has been entered into the database has
mysteriously disappeared. This becomes
increasingly important on the Activities tab,
which contains several options (including three
buried away behind the Option button). The Task
and Opportunity lists can be even more confus-
ing; these lists contain a variety of options — all
of which can be hidden away with one click of
the Hide Filters button.

 Activities: Lists all activities for the contact, group, or company; you can
filter the activities by date, private versus public, cleared, timeless, type
of activity, priority, and user. I go in depth about the Activities tab in
Chapter 9.
 Opportunities: Lists the financial lowdown on all the selling opportuni-
ties for the current contact, group, or company; you can filter the oppor-
tunities by date, status, private versus public, and user. Chapter 20
covers the Opportunities tab.
 Documents: Lists all files attached to the current contact, group, or 
company; you can’t filter this tab. See the section, “Documenting Your
Documents,” later in this chapter for more about the Documents tab.
 Secondary Contacts: Lists the secondary contacts, for example, the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker, that are directly associ-
ated with the current contact; you can’t filter this tab. Flip ahead a few
pages to the “Corralling Your Secondary Contacts” section in this chap-
ter where I discuss the Secondary Contacts tab.
 Groups/Companies: This tab has a dual-personality. You’ll notice the addi-
tion of the Show Membership For drop-down list that lets you indicate
whether you want to view the groups or the companies that the contact is
associated with. This tab only appears in the Contact Detail window.
 Contacts: Lists all the contacts associated with the current group or
company. You only see this tab in the Group Detail window or the
Company Detail window.
You’ll notice that the first five tabs appear on the Contacts, Groups, and
Companies windows. That’s because you can add a note, an activity, and so
on to either an individual contact record, or to a company or group record.
Remodeling lists and tabs
One of the reasons that you might find the lists and tabs to be so useful is 
the ease in which you can customize them. You can change the order of the
columns, widen the columns, add or remove columns, and then print out your
final product. In this section, I cover a few ways in which you can change the
look of your lists and tabs.
Adding or removing columns
Probably the first thing that you want to do to modify your lists and columns is
to add or remove an additional column — or two or three! Follow these steps:
1. Click the Options button (in the top-right corner) on any list or tab
and choose Customize Columns from the menu that appears.
The Customize Columns dialog box appears (see Figure 5-1).
65
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

2. Select the field (column) that you want to add by clicking the appro-
priate choice in the Available Fields list.
Depending on the list or tab you’re working with, you see various field
choices. Feel free to include as many — or as few as your little heart
desires.
3. Click the single right-pointing arrow.
If you’re really into seeing a lot of information, you can click the double
right-pointing arrows; that adds all available fields to your list or tab.
4. To remove an item, click the appropriate choice from the Show as
Columns in This Order and then click the single left-pointing arrow.
If you really want to get rowdy, click the double left-pointing arrows to
remove all the current fields. You might do this if you have an over-
whelming desire to start from scratch.
5. Click the Close button when you’re done.
Changing the order and width of columns 
You can also change the order of the fields from the Customize Columns
dialog box. Click the appropriate choice from the Show as Columns in This
Order and click the Move Up or Move Down buttons.
The order that the items appear in the Customize Columns dialog box is
exactly the way they appear in your final product. Knock yourself out, arrange
and rearrange all you want, and sleep peacefully knowing that if you don’t like
the outcome you can always change it again. Now, if I could just do that with
my living room!
You can also drag-and-drop the various column headings to change the order
in which columns appear on the lists and tabs. For example, if you want the
Date field to appear before the Time field, simply click the Time column head-
ing and drag the heading over to the left of the Date column heading.
Figure 5-1:
Adding
columns to
the Contact
List.
66
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Changing the width of a column is almost as easy. If you move your mouse on
the line between any two column headings, your cursor transforms into a
double-headed arrow. When that arrow appears, hold down your left mouse
button and drag to the left or right to narrow or widen a column. The column
to the left of your mouse changes width.
Sorting your lists and tabs
In general I hate terms like “automatic” and “click of a button” because your
vision of “automatic” might be quite different from that of a software engineer.
That said, sorting the entries in any of your lists and tabs is, well, automatic
and can be done with the click of a button: Just click the column heading that
you want to use to sort the list. Want the contacts in your Contact list to be
sorted alphabetically by city? Click the City column heading. Change your mind
and want it sorted by zip code instead? Click the Zip Code column heading.
When you click a column heading, an up arrow appears indicating that the
contacts are sorted in ascending order (in alphabetical, A-to-Z, or 1–10 order).
To reverse the sort order, click the column heading again. If the list is sorted
in ascending order, contacts that have no information in the selected column
appear first in the list. In descending order, they appear last in the list.
Sorting your contacts is so simple that you may decide to get really adventur-
ous and sort based on another criterion. Go ahead — I dare you! Click any
column heading to re-sort the list by the field of your choice.
ACT! automatically separates the contact’s name into a first and a last name.
When you click the Contact column heading in any of the lists or tabs, you’ll
notice that your information is sorted by last name so that Lindsay Garrison
appears alphabetically with the Gs rather than with the Ls.
Corralling Your Secondary Contacts
Does this scenario sound familiar? You have a main contact, but of course that
person, being the big cheese, is rarely available so you often have to work with
his assistant. But of course the assistant can’t do any true decision making, so
you might need to speak to Mr. Big’s sales manager on occasion. And, when the
sales manager goes on vacation, you need to call the assistant sales manager.
Yikes! The Secondary Contacts tab, shown in Figure 5-2, allows you to store all
the pertinent information about Mr. Big and his partners in crime in the same
area so you don’t have to go on a wild goose chase hunting down names, tele-
phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. And, just like promotions that often
happen, you can “promote” a secondary contact into a main contact.
67
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

Not sure whether to add a contact as a primary or a secondary contact? You
might want to think of how you are going to use the secondary contact. If you
just want to be able to access an assistant’s phone number, then the assistant
is a good candidate for entry as a secondary contact. However, if you want to
be able to e-mail your monthly newsletter to the assistant or include her in
some of your mail merges, you need to add the assistant as a primary contact
record instead.
Adding a secondary contact
Of course, you can’t add a secondary contact until you create a main contact
(see Chapter 4 to do so). After you create the head honcho’s contact record,
here’s what you do to create the secondary contact record(s):
1. From the Contact Detail window, click the Secondary Contacts tab.
2. Click the New Secondary Contact button on the top of the Secondary
Contact tab.
The Secondary Contact dialog box appears (see Figure 5-3).
3. Fill in all the juicy details for the secondary contact. 
Although you don’t fill in quite as much information as you can for a
main contact, you do have all the really pertinent fields. Don’t forget to
click the Business Address tab for even more fields.
Figure 5-2:
The
Secondary
Contact tab.
68
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

4. Click OK to create the secondary contact.
Congratulations! Your main contact has now given birth to a secondary con-
tact. All the secondary contacts that you create appear on the Secondary
Contacts tab of the primary contact.
If you need to go back and edit or add information for the secondary contact,
just double click the name from the Secondary Contact list and voilà, you’re
back to the Secondary Contact dialog box.
Deleting a secondary contact
Sorry to say, but some of the secondary contacts may drift off into the
sunset, leaving you with the need to remove them from your database. Not to
worry; you can delete a secondary contact by following the bouncing ball
through these steps:
1. Click the Secondary Contacts tab from the Contact Detail window.
2. Right-click the contact you want to delete and choose Delete.
You can never say that ACT! doesn’t give you ample warning before
deleting a contact. As usual, when you attempt to delete even a sec-
ondary contact ACT! shows you the scary warning seen in Figure 5-4.
3. Click Yes to delete the selected secondary contact.

Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

Promoting a secondary contact
Promoting, promotion — it has a lovely ring to it, don’t you think? That lowly
assistant might be promoted through the ranks and some day become the “big
guy” — or at the very least a more important contact than he/she is today. If
you’re worried that you have to reenter all that basic information in again,
don’t be. Just promote the contact by following these steps:
1. Click the Secondary Contacts tab in the Contact Detail window.
2. Select the secondary contact that you want to promote.
3. Right-click and choose Promote from the menu.
The Promote Secondary Contact dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
4. Select whether to duplicate the main contact’s primary fields.
With promotions come responsibilities and decisions. If the secondary
contact is sliding into the role of the current primary contact, you want
to copy all that information to the record of the newly promoted con-
tact. If, however, the secondary contact doesn’t have the same basic
information as the primary contact, you can choose not to copy the pri-
mary fields.
5. Click OK.

Documenting Your Documents
No matter how organized you think your documents might be, you probably
occasionally misplace one of them. Of course you can always have Windows
search for it, but ACT! offers an easier — and faster solution. The Documents
tab, which you can find on the Contacts, Groups, or Companies windows,
allows you to attach any and all of your files related to the current contact,
group, or company. You can add a proposal created in Excel, a contract cre-
ated in Word, or even a PDF file that you scanned into your computer. By
adding them to the Documents tab, which is shown in Figure 5-6, you are
actually creating a shortcut to the document.
After you add a document to the Documents tab, you can open the file
directly from ACT! to view, edit, or print. Or, if you prefer, you can still fish
through your computer and open the document in your word processor as
you’re already used to doing. You can also link the same document to multi-
ple records. Removing a file from the Documents tab does not remove it from
your computer.
Figure 5-6:
The ACT!
Documents
tab.
71
Chapter 5: A Few Good Tabs and Lists

Adding a document
Adding a file to the Documents tab is very easy, and considering the time you
save down the road, well worth the effort. Just follow these steps:
1. Display the contact, group, or company record to which you want to
add a document.
2. Click the Documents tab.
3. Click the Add Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area, and then choose
Add Document from the menu.
The Attach File dialog box opens.
4. Browse to the document you want to add, select it, and then click
Open.
ACT! adds the document to your ACT! database, creates a shortcut to
the document, and displays the filename, size, type, and last modified
date on the Documents tab. Because the document is now part of your
database, remote synchronization users can now access the document
as well.
You can drag and drop a file to the Documents tab from Windows Explorer or
My Computer by dragging the document’s icon to the Documents tab.
Opening a document
The true benefit of adding documents to the Documents tab is the speed in
which you can open the documents that pertain to a specific contact, group,
or company. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Documents tab.
2. Select the document you want to open.
3. Click the Edit Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area and choose Edit
Document from the menu.
Magically, the program associated with the document opens, revealing
the document. You’re on you own here — just remember that you can
now edit, save, or print the document as you normally do. Any changes
you make are reflected the next time you open the document again
either through ACT! or the original program.
72
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Removing a document
After you add a file to the Documents tab, you might change your mind and
decide to make it go am-scray. Easy come, easy go. Follow these steps to rid
yourself of the offending document:
1. Display the contact, group, or company record that contains the docu-
ment you want to eliminate.
2. Click the Documents tab.
3. In the Document List, select the document you want to remove.
You might have saved the same document to more than one contact
record. Removing the association between a document and one
contact record does not affect the link between that file and the
other contact record. The document is still contained inside the
database.
4. Click the Remove Document button on the Documents tab icon bar.
Alternatively, you can right-click in the file list area, and choose Remove
Document from the menu.
ACT makes sure you want to remove the document by presenting a
warning. Software programs very often present you with scary messages
before deleting important information. This is a good thing. Heed the
warnings!
ACT! removes the link between the document and the current record. It
also removes the document from within the database. And, because the
document doesn’t end up in the Recycle Bin, think very carefully before
deleting the document.
5. Click Yes to confirm that you really, truly want to remove the 
document.

T
he basic Contact Detail window shows you all the fields in your database
as they pertain to a single contact. Conversely, the Contact List view allows
you to see all your contacts together in one list. In the Contact List, you can
find contacts, sort your list of contacts, and create lookups of contacts. Best
of all, after you arrange the Contact List just the way you like it, you can print
out the information exactly as it appears on-screen. ACT! automatically sorts
all your contacts alphabetically by company; in this chapter you find out how
to sort your contacts by up to three fields. After you get the hang of ACT!, you
may want to import more contacts into your database — stay tuned!
Contacting the Contact List
The Contact List is a good way to view your contacts if you’re working with
large numbers of contacts at one time. Changing the columns that appear in
the Contact List provides you with a way of comparing information between
your various contacts. For example, you may want to see how many of your
contacts purchased each of your products, and have the name of each prod-
uct appear in the Contact List along with their telephone number.
Getting to the Contact List is half the fun
The road to the Contact List is simple to follow — just choose View➪
Contact List. A list of your contacts displayed in columns appears, as 
shown in Figure 6-1.

When you come across a contact record in your list that requires a bit of
tweaking you may want to flip to the Contact Detail window to make your
changes. You can get to the Contact Detail window in a number of ways:
 Double-click a contact in the Contact List.
 Right-click the contact and choose Go To Contact.
 Click the Back button on the Back and Forward bar if you were just in
the Contact Detail window.
The Contact Detail window appears with the selected contact’s record. To
return to the Contact List, choose View➪Contact List or click the Back button
on the Back and Forward bar.
Finding a contact in the Contact List
In Chapter 7, I show you how to create a lookup to find contacts that meet
your specific criteria. The Contact List also allows you to go to a specific con-
tact record in the blink of an eye. Here’s what you need to do:
1. Click the column heading to select that column.
For example, if you want to find a contact by last name, click the Contact
column heading.
Figure 6-1:
The ACT!
Contact List.
76
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

2. Start typing the first few letters of the contact information that you
want to find in the Look For text field.
If you click the Company Name column heading, type in the first few let-
ters of the company that you’re looking for. If you click the Contact column
heading, start typing the first few letters of the contact’s last name.
ACT! scrolls down the Contact List to the closest match. For example, if
you sorted the list by contact and typed the letter s, you might land on
Colonel Sanders contact record. If you typed sm, you’re probably look-
ing at all your Smiths.
3. Continue typing until you reach the contact for whom you are looking.
Tagging contacts in the Contact List
Using the Contact List, you can easily select — or tag — contacts to manually
create a lookup of your contacts. For example, say that you want to target
some of your best clients for a special promotion; a general lookup probably
doesn’t produce a list of those contacts because you don’t have a field that
includes special promotions. Instead, you can tag those contacts based on
your own instincts.
To switch to Tag mode, just make sure that a check mark is showing next to
the Enable Tag Mode option, which is located at the top of the Contact List.
You can do the following things in Tag mode:
 Tag a contact: Click anywhere in the contact; a gray bar appears across
the contact record indicating that you tagged it. Figure 6-2 shows tagged
contacts.
 Untag a contact: Click anywhere in a contact, and the gray bar disappears.
 Tag a continuous list of names: Click the first name in the list that
you’re selecting, and then press the Shift key while clicking the last
name in the list that you’re selecting.
Figure 6-2:
Selected
contacts in
Tag mode.
77
Chapter 6: Working with Your Data

Notice the four buttons to the right of the Enable Tag Mode option (refer to
Figure 6-2). After you tag the contacts that you want to work with or those
that you want to omit temporarily, choose one of the following four buttons:
 Tag All: Allows you to select all the contacts currently showing in the
Contact List.
 Untag All: Allows you to deselect any contacts that you already selected.
 Lookup Selected: Allows you to create a lookup based on the contacts
that you tag.
 Omit Selected: Allows you to remove the contacts that you select from
the Contact List. Don’t panic — it does not remove the contacts perma-
nently from your database!
Flip to Chapter 11 if you need to print out any lists and tabs for the lowdown
on Quick Reports.
Sorting your contacts
By default, your contacts are sorted alphabetically by the Company column.
You can see this two different ways:
 A small triangle appears in the Company column heading in the Contact
List.
 You remember your alphabet from grammar school, and you notice that
companies starting with the letter A appear before those starting with
the letter B as you scroll through your contacts.
78
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 
Playing tag with your contacts
One of things I like best about ACT!, and believe
me there are a lot, is the ability to create custom
lookups. Although Chapter 7 explains the most
popular ways to create a lookup, sometimes you
want to cut your database into “bite-sized”
pieces — and none of the existing lookups help.
For example, you may be planning a party and
want to handpick all the invitees from your
Contact List.
You can handpick items from a list or tab in two
ways. Those of you who are familiar with
Windows shortcuts probably already know them:
 If the items are all situated next to one
another, click the first item in the list that
you want to include, press the Shift key, and
click the last desired item in your list.
 If the items appear rather randomly
throughout your list, click the first item in the
list, press the Ctrl key, and click the rest of
the items to select them.
After you select all the items you want to
include, right-click the selected area and
choose Create Lookup.

In Chapter 5, you discover that you can sort any list view by clicking the
appropriate column heading that you want to use to sort the list. For exam-
ple, to sort by the contact’s last name, click the Contact column in the
Contact List.
Although the Contact List provides you with a quick-as-a-bunny way to sort
your contacts, it sorts the contacts based on the contents of a single field. If
you want to sort your contacts based on multiple criteria, you have another
way to do it:
1. Choose Edit➪Sort from either the Contact List or Contact Detail
window.
The Sort dialog box appears (see Figure 6-3).
2. Choose an option from the Sort By drop-down list to specify the first-
level sort criterion.
3. Select the sorting order (Ascending or Descending).
Ascending sort order means from A–Z or from the smallest number to
the largest number. Records with no information in the field used for the
Figure 6-3:
The Sort
dialog box.
79
Chapter 6: Working with Your Data
Why aren’t my contacts sorting correctly?
At times, your contacts may appear to not
alphabetize correctly. Possible reasons for this
include
 A stray mark or a blank space in front of the
field name; ’Zinger & Co. appears alphabet-
ically in front of Gadgets R Us.
 Numbers appear alphabetically in front 
of letters. 1st Financial Savings & Loan
appears alphabetically in front of AAA Best
Bank.
 ACT! may be a little confused about the first
and last name of a contact; a quick trip to
the Contact Detail window is worth your
time. Click the ellipsis button next to the
Contact’s name and then double-check that
the correct first and last names appear in
the appropriate spots.

sort appear first. Descending means from Z–A or from the largest number
to the smallest number. Records with no information in the field used for
the sort appear last.
4. Choose a second field option from the And Then By drop-down list
and specify Ascending or Descending.
5. If you want a third level of sorting, choose a field from the And
Finally By drop-down list and specify Ascending or Descending.
6. Click OK.
Importing New Information into ACT! 
You might have nothing but time on your hands and decide that the one thing
you want to do with all that time is to sit down and enter in thousands of new
contacts into your database. Or, you may have lots of excess cash in your
drawer and decide to hire someone to enter in thousands of new contacts
into your database. My hat is off to you, and all I can ask is that you send me
a postcard in ten years when you finish.
If you’re hoping that ACT! has an easier solution — it does! The question you
need to ask yourself is where did that data come from? If your data came
from any of the following sources I have great news for you:
 You purchased a list and received it as a download or on a disk.
 You downloaded a list from an Internet site.
 You received the list in conjunction with a trade show you attended on a
disk.
 Someone in your organization has been keeping his or her contact infor-
mation in another (gasp!) program besides ACT!.
 Another piece of software that you’re using, for example QuickBooks,
contains a good portion of the contact information you want to have 
in ACT!.
All these situations mean that your data is in electronic format, which you
can easily import into ACT!. You get to head to the beach rather than head
for your keyboard. ACT! can easily import your information if it is currently in
one of the following formats:
 ACT! in either the current or prior versions
 Outlook
80
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

If you or someone in your organization is currently using Outlook for
contact management, you need to check out Chapter 19 to find out how
easily you can import that information into ACT!.
 dBase
 Palm Desktop
 Text-delimited
Most databases have an option to export the data. After you export the data,
you need to save the data in text tab delimited format. You can easily save
data in the correct format using Excel. If you are using a relatively old pro-
gram that was written for DOS, you may not find an Export option. Not to
worry — most DOS programs allow you to “print to file,” which in essence is
creating a text file.
To start importing information and stop spending countless hours hovering
over your keyboard, follow these steps:
1. Open the ACT! database you want to import your information into.
If you are importing another ACT! database, performing routine mainte-
nance on that database and backing it up before attempting to bring in
the new data is a good idea. Not sure how to perform these feats?
Chapter 17 explains them in more detail.
Only Administrators and Managers have permission to import data into
the ACT! database.
Before you start importing data, be sure to select the Duplicate Checking
option. This option is particularly important if you suspect that your cur-
rent database may include some of the same contacts as the imported
information. Duplicate checking merges any duplicate records with exist-
ing ACT! records. If you don’t have duplicate checking turned on, you
might find yourself merging hundreds — or even thousands — of dupli-
cate records one pair at a time. Check out Chapter 17 to discover the ins
and outs of duplicate checking.
2. Choose File➪Import.
Holy guacamole! A wizard helps you out; if you follow the instructions,
you have your data imported in a jiffy.
3. Click Next to continue.
The Specify Source screen of the wizard appears (see Figure 6-4).
4. Fill in the important information about your import.
• What Type of File Do You Want to Import: Choose the file type
from the drop-down menu.
81
Chapter 6: Working with Your Data

• File Name and Location: If you click the Browse button, you can
navigate to the file that you’re importing.
• User Name and Password: If you are importing an existing ACT!
database into the current database, you need to supply this infor-
mation for the old database. If you are importing data from another
format, these options are grayed out.
5. Click Next to continue.
6. Specify the type of records you want to import and then click Next.
If you are importing an existing database, you can choose to import con-
tact, group, or company records. If you are importing a text file, you can
decide if you want the imported information to appear as contact,
group, or company records.
The Specify Import Options screen appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
7. Specify your import options if importing a text file and then click
Next.
Here’s where you can indicate whether your text file is in tab or comma
format and whether you want to include the header row of your import
file. The header row is the row that names each of the fields you are
importing. If you include it, you end up with a contact record whose
company name might be “company.” Usually, you want to include the
header row to make sure that all your fields map to the correct spot —
and then delete it after you verify all your fields map correctly.

Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

The Contact Map screen of the wizard appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
8. Map the fields from the new information to existing fields in the ACT!
database and then click Next.
Mapping fields allows you to associate field names from the import data-
base to the corresponding fields in your current ACT! database. If the
names of the fields in your import database exactly match the names of
the fields in your current ACT! database, you’re home free. You’ll notice
in Figure 6-6 that the left side of this screen indicates the field names of
the source database you are importing; the right side indicates the field
names of your current or target database.

Chapter 6: Working with Your Data

Blank fields in the right column are indications that the field in the left
column doesn’t import. To remedy this situation, you need to click the
drop-down arrows for all blank ACT! fields and indicate the name of the
ACT! field you want to use to hold this new data. If your ACT! database is
missing key fields, you need to add them to your database before you
can import information; Chapter 15 tells you how to add fields to your
database.
After you map the fields, you can save the mapping by clicking the Save
Map icon. That way, you can click the Load Map button in the future if
you ever import another similar database. It also comes in handy to
save a map in case you have to stop the import in order to add in a few
missing fields.
You’ll notice a few arrow buttons along the top. If you click the right-
pointing arrow, you’re treated to a sneak preview of what your informa-
tion is going to look like after the import completes.
To make life easier on yourself, you may consider renaming the fields in
your import database to exactly match the names of your ACT! fields.
For example, ACT!’s main address field is labeled Address 1. Renaming
the address field in your import database to Address 1 causes the fields
in both databases to map automatically.
9. Specify the merge options if importing another ACT! database into
your current one.
ACT! is now asking for a bit of feedback concerning what happens if a
contact record in the import database matches a contact record in your
current ACT! database. Typically, you want to merge the information
together so that the notes you entered for Nancy Wilson in your import
database combine with the notes you added for Nancy in your current
ACT! database. However, if you prefer, you can change the option so
either
• Duplicated information isn’t imported.
• Information from the import database overrides the information in
your current ACT! database.
10. Click Finish to start your merge.
You may want to take a quick break after completing the wizard.
Depending on the number of contact you are importing, this step can
take a while. Just make sure you keep an eye on your computer; ACT!
may run into multiple duplicate contacts and ask you if you want to
merge them together.
84
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

After importing your contacts, you may want to tweak them a bit. For exam-
ple, you may want to change the ID/Status field to Prospect, or the Referred
To field to Imported Database. Chapter 7 walks you through creating a lookup
based on the contact’s Create Date field, and Chapter 17 shows you how to
perform a global search and replace.
ACT! version 2005 handles the set-up of custom and monthly recurring activi-
ties differently than in earlier versions of ACT!. If you import custom or
monthly recurring activities from an earlier version, you’ll notice a difference
in the way the activities are set up for those scheduled to repeat on more
than one day of each week in a month. To change how recurring activities dis-
play, see Chapter 9.

Corex CardScan
I discuss importing lists into ACT! in this chap-
ter. However, you may be staring at a tower of
business cards sitting on the corner of your
desk, determined to start inputting all that infor-
mation into ACT!. Ah, the best laid plans of mice
and men! Do yourself a favor and buy the
CardScan by Corex.
This cool little gizmo can easily fit on a corner
of your desk. You simply feed in each business
card, and the software translates the information
from the business card into fields. Although the
cards scan with better than 90 percent accu-
racy, you probably want to double-check the
accuracy of each card. Then — and this part
is my favorite — click the ACT! button in the
card scanner software and watch as that
mountain of cards you just scanned magically
appears in ACT!. For more information, check

The ACT! Lookup: Searching 
for Your Contacts
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basic ACT! lookup

 Performing advanced queries
I
f all roads lead to Rome, then surely all processes in ACT! lead to the
lookup. A lookup is a way of looking at only a portion of the contacts in
your database, depending on your specifications. A good practice in ACT! 
is to perform a lookup first and then perform an action second. For example,
you might perform a lookup and then print some labels. Or you might do a
lookup and then perform a mail merge. Need a report? Do a lookup first! In
this chapter, I show you how to perform lookups based on contact informa-
tion, on notes and history information, and on advanced query information.
ACT! Is Looking Up
The theory behind the lookup is that you don’t always need to work with all
your contacts at one time. Not only is working with only a portion of your
database easier; at times, doing so is absolutely necessary. If you’re changing
your mailing address, you probably want to send a notification to everyone in
your database. If you’re running a special sales promotion, you probably only
notify your prospects and customers. If you’re sending out overpriced holi-
day gift baskets, however, you probably want the names of only your very
best customers.

In ACT!, you can focus on a portion of your contacts by
 Creating basic lookups based on the information in one of the nine most-
commonly used contact fields in ACT!. (See the later section,
“Performing Basic Lookups.”)
 Conducting a query based on information stored in your groups, compa-
nies, and opportunities. (See the later section, “Searching Your Groups,
Companies, and Opportunities.”)
 Creating lookups based on information from other areas in your data-
base including notes, histories, activities, annual events, and contact
activity. (See the later section, “Performing Special ACT! Lookups.”)
 Creating your own, more advanced, queries based on the parameters of
your own choosing by using logical operators. (See the later section,
“Creating Advanced Queries.”)
Performing Basic Lookups
The easiest way to pose a query is to choose one of your main contact fields
from a menu and then fill in the search criteria. This way is easy because the
menus guide you, but it’s also the least flexible way. The Lookup menu that
ACT! provides is probably the best — and simplest — place to start when cre-
ating a lookup; just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Lookup menu from the Contact Detail window.
Figure 7-1 shows you the Lookup menu that drops down and the criteria
that you can use to perform your lookup.
88
Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 
Don’t create an extra database — 
use the ACT! lookup instead
Some ACT! users originally create several data-
bases, not realizing that one database can be
used to store information about various dif-
ferent types of contacts. Although you might
want to create two separate databases —
for instance, one for customers and one for
vendors — a better alternative is to include both
your customers and vendors together in one
database. To this one database you can then
add a few miscellaneous contacts, including
prospects that aren’t yet customers or referral
sources that might lead to new customers. Just
make sure that each contact is identified in
some specific way; I recommend using the
ID/Status field. Then when you want to see only
vendors or only prospective customers, simply
perform a lookup to work with just that particu-
lar group of contacts.

2. Choose one of the criteria listed in Figure 7-1 to create a basic lookup.
The ACT! Lookup Contacts dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.
3. If you’re searching based on an Other field, click the Look in This
Field drop-down arrow and choose a field from the drop-down list.
4. In the For the Current Lookup area, select an option:
• Replace Lookup: Creates a brand-new lookup based on your 
criteria.
• Add to Lookup: Adds the contacts based on your criteria to an
existing lookup. For example, if you created a lookup for your con-
tacts based in Chicago, select this option to add your New York
clients to the set of Chicago clients.

89
Chapter 7: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

• Narrow Lookup: Refines a lookup based on a second criterion. For
example, if you’ve created a lookup of all your customers, select
this option to narrow the lookup to only customers based in
Philadelphia.
5. In the Search For area, select an option:
• Company: Type the word to search for or select a word from the
drop-down list if you’re looking for contacts that match a specific
criterion.
• Empty Field: If you’re looking for contacts that don’t have any data
in the given field — for example, people who don’t have an e-mail
address — choose this option.
• Non-Empty Field: If you want to find only those contacts that have
data in a given field — for example, everyone who has an e-mail
address — choose this option.
When typing in the match criterion, remember that with ACT! less
is more. ACT! automatically searches by the beginning of your
string. If you type Tech, ACT! returns Tech Benders and Technology
Consultants. However, if you type Technology, you only find
Technology Consultants.
6. Click OK.
The record counter now reflects the number of contacts that match your
search criteria.
7. Choose Lookup➪All Contacts when you’re ready to once again view
all the contacts in your database.

Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 
Playing the wild card
Some of you old-timers may remember that the
asterisk (*) was the DOS wild card. That same
concept exists in SQL-based products like ACT!
except that the percent sign (%) replaced the
asterisk for some reason known only to the
technical gods.
Say you’re trying to find all companies that are
carpet cleaners. If you created a lookup using
the word carpet, you find Carpet Cleaning by
Joanne Chamar but not Joanne’s Carpet
Cleaning. Enter the wild card. If you create your
lookup using %carpet%, ACT! finds companies
that both begin and end with carpet.

Searching Your Groups, Companies, 
and Opportunities
Probably the most common lookups you create are based on your contact
fields. However, you aren’t limited to searching by just those fields. You can
also query your groups, companies, and opportunities for key information.
The best part is that all three queries work in pretty much the same way.
Grappling with your groups
To find the groups that match your search criteria, here’s all you need to do:
1. Choose Lookup➪Groups.
The Lookup Groups dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2. Choose from one of the following options in the Look in This Field area:
• All Groups: Opens the Group List showing you a list of all the
groups in your database.
• Group Name: Finds all groups that match the name you specify.
• Other Fields: Allows you to search through any and all group fields
for the groups that match your desired criterion. The list shows all
group fields that you can search in the database.
• Save Lookup as Group: Lets you create a group based on the cur-
rently displayed contacts.
If you choose the All Groups or Save Lookup as Group options, you’re
finished. If you choose the Name or Other Fields option, you have to
continue along your merry way following these remaining steps.
Figure 7-3:
The Lookup
Groups

Chapter 7: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

3. In the Search For area, type the word to search for, or select a word
from the drop-down list.
4. In the For the Current Lookup area, select the Replace Lookup option.
5. Click OK.
Like magic, the Group List pops open, displaying a list of all the groups
that match your specifications.
Calling all companies
Hopefully, creating a lookup of companies seems vaguely familiar because it
is so similar to creating a group lookup. To find the companies that match
your search criteria, here’s all you need to do:
1. Choose Lookup➪Companies.
The Lookup Companies dialog box appears.
2. Choose from one of the following options:
• All Companies: Opens the Company List showing you a list of all
the companies in your database.
• Name
• Main Phone
• City
• State
• Zip Code
• ID/Status: Just like you use the ID/Status field to classify each of
your contacts into a separate category, assign your companies an
ID/Status. For example, if one of your company ID/Status options is
wholesale, it’s a snap to find all your “wholesale” companies.
• Other Fields: Provides you with a drop-down list of all your com-
pany fields.
• Save Lookup as Company: Lets you create a company based on
the currently displayed contacts.
Ogling your opportunities 
To find the opportunities that match your search criteria, here’s all you need
to do:
1. Choose Lookup➪Opportunities.
2. Choose one of the following options:
92
Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 

• All Opportunities: Opens the Opportunities List view, showing you
a list of all the opportunities in your database.
• Name: Finds opportunities that match the name you specify.
Typically, you want to use the quote number as the name of your
quote so that you can lookup based on that criterion. Chapter 20
shows you how to name your quotes.
• Stage: Finds opportunities that match a specific sales stage.
• Product: Finds opportunities that pertain to a specific product.
• Total: Finds opportunities that match the total sale you specify.
You can also search for opportunities that are larger or smaller
than a specified dollar amount.
• Status: Finds opportunities that match a specific sales status.
• Other Fields: Finds all opportunities that match any other opportu-
nity fields, including the eight opportunity fields you can customize.
If you chose the first option, you’re rewarded with a list of all your
opportunities. If you opt for one of the other options, the Lookup
Opportunities dialog box, displayed in Figure 7-4, appears.
3. Select the field on which you wish to search in the Look in This Field
drop-down list.
The list shows all opportunity fields that you can search.
4. In the Search For area, type the word to search for or select a word
from the drop-down list.
For example, if you’re looking for all opportunities that are in the
Negotiation stage, select Stage in the Look in This Field drop-down list
and Negotiation in the Search For drop-down list.
5. Select Replace Lookup in the For the Current Lookup drop-down list.

Chapter 7: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

Although you may be happy as a little clam creating and modifying your
lookups, you can achieve the same results by filtering your Opportunity 
List. Filtering may even make you ecstatic because you’ll probably find it 
a bit easier. Chapter 5 shows you how to filter your Opportunities List.
Performing Special ACT! Lookups
The ability to perform a simple lookup based on a single field criterion is an
element common to most databases, but ACT! isn’t your average database.
All databases contain fields, but only special databases contain things such
as notes and activities. And after creating a note to store a useful tidbit of
information (which I show you how to do in Chapter 8), you’ll want to find
that information again. ACT! provides you with three special query options 
to find information that was entered into ACT! in a special way.
Searching by keyword
The keyword search can be an extremely useful way to find data about your
contacts no matter where that information might be lurking. ACT!’s keyword
search enables you to perform lookups for information in Contact, Notes/
Histories, Activities, Sales/Opportunities, and E-mail Addresses fields. For
example, suppose that you’re looking for someone to design a new logo for
your business but you can’t remember where you stored that information. Is
logo part of the company’s name, did you enter it into the ID/Status field, or
did you stick it in a note somewhere? A keyword search searches throughout
your database, checking all fields, until it finds the word logo.
Here’s how to perform a keyword search:
1. From the Contact Detail window, choose Lookup➪Keyword Search.
The Keyword Search dialog box opens (see Figure 7-5).
2. In the Search For area, enter the key piece of information you are
searching for.
If you’re entering criteria into a drop-down list, the word fills in automat-
ically for you as you start to type.
3. In the Record Type drop-down list, indicate whether you are looking
for a Contact, Group or Company record.
4. In the Search These Records area, choose an option:
• All Records: ACT! sifts through all records in your database.

Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 

• Current Record: ACT! searches only the record that was on-screen
when you opened the dialog box. Use this option if you know that
somewhere in the deep, dark past, you entered a specific tidbit of
information as a note.
• Current Lookup: ACT! searches only the records that you selected
in a previous lookup.
5. In the Look In area, choose an option.
The keyword search is a powerful searching tool, and it does take a bit
longer to run than other searching methods. When you perform a key-
word search, ACT! sifts through every last bit of information in your data-
base, hoping to find a match that fits your specifications. To speed up the
process, limit the amount of elements that you’re searching through.
• Activities: Searches in your activities
• Opportunities: Searches the information on the Opportunities tab
• Histories: Searches through the histories that ACT! has created
• Notes: Searches in the notes you’ve created
• Fields: Searches through all your contact fields
6. After making all your choices, click the Find Now button.
ACT! responds with a list of records, similar to what’s shown in Figure 7-6.
The lookup results show the contact’s name and company and the field in
which ACT! finds the matching data, as well as the data that it finds. For
Figure 7-5:

example, if you searched for the word ACT!, your search includes such
diverse words as interactive and contractor because the letters act appear
in the middle of these words.
7. Decide what you want to do with the results.
Like the old saying goes, be careful what you search for because you just
might find it! Okay, the saying doesn’t go exactly like that, but now that
you’ve found a number of records using the keyword search, you must
decide which one(s) to focus on. Here are some of your options:
• Click the Create Lookup button to see all the records in the
Contact Detail window.
• Double-click any part of a single record, and you land on that con-
tact record. To get back to your search, double-click the Keyword
Search tab that now appears in the bottom-left corner of the
Contact Detail window.
• Select multiple adjacent records by clicking the first record, press-
ing the Shift key, and then clicking the last record. Right-click one
of your selections and choose Lookup Selected Records. You now
have a lookup that consists of only the contacts that you selected.
• Select records that aren’t adjacent by clicking the first record,
pressing the Ctrl key, and then clicking the other records that 
you want. Right-click one of your selections and choose Lookup
Selected Records. You now have a lookup that consists of only 
the contacts that you selected.

Annual event lookups
In Chapter 15, I show you how to create Annual Event fields. Annual events
help automate the processes of tracking important dates, such as birthdays or
anniversaries. When you enter a date in an Annual Event field, ACT! automati-
cally tracks the event date from year to year. Because annual events don’t
appear on your calendar, you must perform an Annual Event lookup to display
them. You can use the Annual Event lookup to generate a printed list to dis-
play events for the current week, the current month, or a specified date range.
Combining the power of an Annual Event lookup with an ACT! mail merge is a
great way to save lots of time. Birthdays and anniversaries are good examples
of annual events; like it or not, they happen once a year. The Annual Event
lookup tracks them all down regardless of the event. After you create a lookup
of these customers, you can then send them all a renewal letter by performing
a mail merge. (I show you how to perform a mail merge in Chapter 13.)
Here’s all you need to do to create an Annual Event lookup:
1. From the Contact Detail window, choose Lookup➪Annual Events.
The Annual Events Search dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-7.
2. Select an annual event from the Search For drop-down list.
If you’ve added more than one annual event field to your database, you
can search for more than one of them at a time. For example, you might
want to find everyone who has either a birthday or anniversary in the
month of June.
Figure 7-7:

Chapter 7: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

3. Choose a Time Range option in which you want to search.
Your options are the current week or month, or a selected date range.
4. Click the Find Now button.
The results appear in the lower half of the Annual Events Search dialog
box. Your results vary, depending on the number of contacts that meet
your search criteria. If no contacts meet your search criteria, you
receive a message nicely telling you so.
5. Click one of the following option buttons:
• Go To Contact: To go to the contact record of the selected contact.
• Create Lookup: To create a lookup of all the contacts.
• Schedule To-Do: To schedule an activity for the selected contacts.
Unfortunately, you can schedule only one activity at a time.
• Print List: To print a list of the contacts.
Searching by contact activity
I’ve often estimated that at least 20 percent of the average database consists
of long-lost contact information. You can either ignore these forlorn contacts,
or you might realize that there’s gold in them there hills! What if you could
find all the contacts that you haven’t contacted in, say, the last two years?
Chances are that many of those contacts will be glad to hear from you.
Maybe they lost your contact information or chose a company other than
yours that they weren’t happy with. Suddenly those “lost” contacts have
become a virtual treasure trove.
You can create a lookup of contacts based on the last time that you made 
any changes to their record or contacted them through a meeting, call, or to-
do. You can look for the contacts that either have or have not been changed
within a specified date range. You can also narrow the search according to
activity or history type.
To create a lookup by contact activity, follow these steps:
1. Choose Lookup➪Contact Activity.
The Contact Activity dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-8.
2. Select either Not Changed or Changed from the Look for Contacts That
Have area.
The neat thing about using the Contact Activity lookup is that you can
look for “touched” or “untouched” contacts. In other words, you’re able
to search for all the contacts that you contacted last month or for all the
contacts that you didn’t contact last month.
98
Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 

3. Select a date.
4. Select options in the Search In area to narrow your search.
You can search in the following areas of ACT!:
• Contact fields
• Notes
• Opportunities
• History
• Activities
If you decide to search through your History and/or Activities tabs you
can even indicate which specific types of histories or activities you want
to include in your search.
5. Click OK.
ACT! searches for the selected field or activity that was or was not modi-
fied within the specified date range. The Contact List appears and dis-
plays your selection.
ACT! isn’t searching just through all your contacts; it’s also scouring all
your notes, histories, and opportunities, so it may take a moment or two
to create your search results. Relax and practice a few deep-breathing
exercises while you wait.
Figure 7-8:
The Contact
Activity
dialog box.
99
Chapter 7: The ACT! Lookup: Searching for Your Contacts

Creating Advanced Queries
If you need to base your lookup on multiple criteria, you can perform a basic
lookup and then use the Narrow Lookup option (refer to Figure 7-2) in the
Lookup Contacts dialog box to create a more specific search. This option
works fine if you’re willing to create several lookups until you reach the
desired results. A better alternative is to use a query to create a lookup. A
query searches all the contacts in your database based on the multiple crite-
ria that you specify and then creates a lookup of contacts that match those
criteria.
ACT!’s other lookup functions require that you perform multiple lookups to
add to or subtract from a set of contacts. By using an Advanced Query, you
can find contacts based on criteria in multiple fields. You can enter values in
any field on any tab in the Contact Detail window, except for the system tabs.
Looking up by example
When you create a Lookup by Example, ACT! responds by presenting you
with a blank contact record and lets you specify the fields and values that
define the query.
This is what you do:
1. Choose Lookup➪By Example.
The Lookup by Example window opens. The Lookup by Example
window, as shown in Figure 7-9, looks just like any other contact record
with one major difference — all the fields are blank!
2. Click in the field that you want to query.
You can create a query on virtually any field in your database. Don’t forget
to check out some of those neat fields that might be located on your vari-
ous layout tabs. For example, the Contact Info tab contains the Record
Manager and Create Date fields, which are common things to query on.
3. Fill in any criteria on which you want to search.
Fill in as many criteria as you need. The whole purpose of doing a Lookup
by Example is that you’re looking for contacts that fit more than one cri-
terion. If you’re looking for all customers who are located in San Diego,
type customer in the ID/Status field and San Diego in the City field.
100
Part II: Putting the ACT! to Work 

The Advanced Query
After you use your database for a while and it slowly but surely fills up with
more and more contacts, you may feel the need to add a little more power
into your lookups. In fact, you may even start using the term query, which is
computer-speak for “fancy lookup.” Fortunately for you, although an Advanced
Query packs a lot of power, it’s still a piece of cake to run. Just follow these
steps:
1. Choose Lookup➪Advanced➪Advanced Query.
The Advanced Query window opens up, as shown in Figure 7-10.

2. Select Contact or Opportunity in the Type drop-down list.
3. Select one of the available contact or opportunity fields in the Field
Name drop-down list.
To make life easy for you, you find all your fields listed in the Field Name
drop-down list.
4. Select one of the operators in the Operator field.
Knock yourself out! Indicate whether you’re looking for a specific word,
a field that contains a part of a word, or even a range of figures or dates.
5. In the Value field, select one of the available items that correspond to
the selected Field Name item.
6. Click the Add to List button.
The query criteria appear in the columns in the middle part of the
Advanced Query window.
7. To select more than one criterion, repeat Steps 2 through 6.
8. Click in the And/Or column for the item and select an option if 
necessary.
As you build the query you may want to make use of the And/Or column.
This column helps you group your criteria in order to indicate the rela-
tionship between each set of criteria. In Figure 7-10, notice that the two
state criteria are bracketed together and joined by the word or, indicat-
ing that you’re looking for contacts from either Florida or Oregon.
9. Use the parenthesis column if necessary.
The example in Figure 7-10 groups the two state criteria together with
parentheses so that these queries are carried out together.
10. Click Preview.
For those of you in need of instant gratification, you can see a list of all
the contacts that match your specification. And, if you goofed and no
contacts show up, you can quickly remove a few of your criteria and try
again before anyone notices by clicking the Remove button.
11. When you finish selecting criteria, click OK.
12. At the Run Query Options message, select the Replace Lookup option,
and click OK.
The results of the query display in the Contact List or Opportunities List.

ook around your desk. If you have more than one sticky note attached to
it, you need to use ACT! Look at your computer monitor; if it’s decorated
with sticky notes, you need to use ACT!. Does a wall of sticky notes obscure
your file folders? Do you panic when you can’t find your pad of sticky notes?
Do you have small sticky notes clinging to larger sticky notes? You need to
use ACT!!
In this chapter, I show you how to make a note in ACT!. I also tell you all
about the notes or histories that ACT! creates for you automatically and give
you a short course in reviewing your notes.
Getting to Know ACT! Notes
What if one of your best clients called requesting a price quote? You jot down
some information on a piece of paper — only to have the paper disappear in
the mountain of clutter that you call your desk.
Or imagine that one of your more high-maintenance customers calls you on
March 1 in immediate need of an imported Italian widget. You check with
your distributors and guarantee him one by March 15. On March 10, he calls
you, totally irate that he hasn’t yet received his widget.

Sound familiar? The ACT! note is one of the easiest features to master but one
that too many users overlook. A simple note in ACT! provides you with sev-
eral benefits:
 Your entire office can now be operating on the same page by having
access to the same client data.
 You have a record, down to the date and time, of all communications
that you have with each of your contacts.
 You won’t forget what you said to your customer.
 You won’t forget what your customer said to you.
Adding a note
Considering the importance of notes to the overall scheme of your business,
they are amazing easy to add. Here’s all you have to do to add a note to a
contact record:
1. Make sure that you’re on the contact for which you’re creating a note.
2. Click the Contacts icon on the Nav bar.
3. On the Notes tab (middle of the screen), click the Insert Note icon.
The Insert Note window appears, date- and time-stamped with the cur-
rent date and time. Take a look at Figure 8-1.
4. Start typing your note in the Regarding area.
Your note can be as long or short as you want. You can use the format-
ting options exactly as you do in any word processor to emphasize any
portion of your note. 
Figure 8-1:
Creating a

ACT!.
104
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

5. Click OK to record your note.
That was almost too easy for you; now you can move on to a few tricks that I
have up my sleeve.
Working with notes
After you create a note (see the preceding section), you may need to change
it. To edit a note, just double-click it to get back to the Insert Note window.
After you open it, here are a few things you can change:
 Change the note information: Start typing in the Regarding area exactly
as you do with any word processor.
 Change the date on a note: No matter how much you depend on your
computer, sometimes you still rely on good old-fashioned paper. Maybe
you’ve jotted down a note after you turned off your computer for the day
or made notes — both mental and on paper — at a trade show. When you
start to input those notes into ACT!, they all have the current date rather
than the date when you actually created them. To change the date on a
note, simply click the date and choose a new date from the drop-down
menu that appears.
Not all notes are created equally; some of your notes might be more
important than others. As your list of notes becomes longer, various key
notes may get lost in the shuffle. A real low-tech solution is to postdate
the note by giving it a date several years into the future so that your
note always appears at the top of the Notes tab.
 Attach files to a contact record: In Chapter 5, I talk about adding files to
the Documents tab so that you can view and edit them right from the
Contact Detail window. In addition, you can attach a file to a note in a
contact record. To attach a file to a note, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Note icon on the Notes tab.
2. Click the Attach button in the Insert Note window.
3. Navigate to the file that you want to attach and click Open.
4. Click OK to record the note.
To view the attached file, simply open the note and click the attached
file.
 Spell check a note: If you’re like me, you type notes while doing a hun-
dred other things and end up with a lot of typos. Don’t fret; just run a
spell check by clicking the Spell Check icon in the Insert Note window.
ACT! opens the spell checker and locates any misspellings. Unfortunately,
you can check the spelling for only one note at a time.
105
Chapter 8: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

Discovering ACT! Histories
If you insist on doing things the hard way, feel free to skip this section. If you
love the thought of having someone else doing your work for you, read on!
Maybe you’ve noticed that the History tab is called, well, the History tab. In
the earlier sections of this chapter, I show you how to add and modify notes.
ACT!’s history entries are items that magically appear on the History tab
after you
 Delete a contact (Chapter 4)
 Complete a scheduled meeting, call, or to-do (Chapter 9)
 Write a letter, fax, or mail merge (Chapter 13)
 Change information in a field designated to create history (Chapter 15)
When you clear an activity, a history of the activity is recorded in the contact
record of the person with whom you scheduled the activity. You can also edit
or add activity details to the history, such as adding information about the
decisions made during the meeting. View these histories again later or create
reports based on activities with your contacts.
Creating field histories
ACT! provides you with a very powerful tool when you combine the use of
drop-down lists with the ability to create a history based on the changed
information in the field. By default, ACT! automatically creates a history when
you change the information in either the ID/Status or Last Results field. When
you enter information into either of these fields, it’s automatically saved on
the contact’s History tab.
Suppose that you’ve created ten steps to coincide with the average progres-
sion of one of your prospects into a customer. You need to create these steps
by using ACT!’s Last Results field. As you progress through the sales cycle and
change the content of the Last Results field, ACT! automatically creates a his-
tory indicating when the change took place. Figure 8-2 shows both the content
of the Last Results field and the automatic histories that are created as the
contact progresses through the sales stages.
By relying on the field’s drop-down list to create new content information,
you ensure that your information remains consistent. You can then create
reports on the various sales stages by creating a lookup based on the notes
and histories.
106
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

In Chapter 7, I show you everything you need to know about creating 
lookups — and then some! Chapter 11 explains the various ACT! reports
and shows you how to filter them by date range.
Recording activity histories
In Chapter 9, I explain how to use ACT! to plan your busy schedule. After you
hold or attend a meeting, place a call, or complete something on your to-do
list, clearing the activity is important. Figure 8-3 shows you the ACT! dialog box
that opens each time you clear an activity. Select the Add Details to History
check box, and ACT! automatically inserts a history on the History tab.
ACT! provides you with the same option when you get in touch with a contact
through a letter, e-mail, or fax. Figure 8-4 shows the Create History dialog box
that appears after you create a letter in ACT!. Of course, you can always
choose not to include a history, but you’ll probably find recording one more
useful. You can even add more details in the Regarding area.
Manually recording a history
Situations arise when recording a history of an event just isn’t possible. You
can create a history record for a contact without scheduling and clearing an
activity for that person. You can even add a history for someone who isn’t
yet in your database. For example, you might have called a potential new
client from your car and found juggling the steering wheel, your phone, and
Figure 8-2:

107
Chapter 8: Stamping Out the Sticky Note

your lunch while typing on your laptop a bit too daunting a task. But when
you return to the office, you still need to record the calls that you made and
the tasks that you completed.
You can also record one history for an entire group of people. For example, you
might have attended a meeting at your local Chamber of Commerce and want
to record a few details about the meeting for each of the attendees. Regardless
of why you need to do it, here’s how you create a history after the fact:
1. Find the contact for whom you want to record a history.
If you’re creating a history for an entire group of people, create a lookup
of the contacts for whom you want to add a note and then
Figure 8-4:

108

a. Switch to the Contact List.
b. Click the Tag All button to select all the contacts. (See Chapter 6
for the details on tagging.)
2. Choose Contacts➪Record History.
The Record History window opens, as shown in Figure 8-5.
3. Select an activity type from the Type list.
If you need more activity types, don’t worry. Chapter 10 shows you how
to increase your selection of activity types.
4. Select a Result option.
5. Enter date, time, and duration information.
6. Enter activity information in the Regarding field or select a descrip-
tion from the drop-down list.
7. Add additional information in the Details area.
The information that you enter here is added to the Regarding field on
the History tab.
8. Click OK to record the history.
Your note is now recorded in the contact’s record. If you created a his-
tory for an entire group of contacts, the note appears in the contact
record of each individual in the group.
If you click the Follow Up button instead of OK, you can schedule a new,
follow-up activity in the same way that you scheduled your original activ-
ity. Talk about one-stop shopping! The result of your phone call might 
be that you left a message or that you attempted to make the call but
couldn’t get through. By scheduling a follow-up activity, you have the
results of your original phone call — and a reminder to try to make con-
tact again in the future. You can also schedule follow-up activities for the
next step in your sales process.

Working with Your Notes and Histories
The Notes and History tabs are very similar, and consequently, you can use
them in similar ways. They are so similar in fact that in previous versions of
ACT!, they were actually combined into one single tab. Here are a few things
that you can do to make working with notes and histories even easier.
 Delete a note or history. To delete a note or history, you must first
select it and then press the Delete key; the note is gone. You can also
right-click the selected note and choose Delete Selected from the menu.
Either way, ACT! presents you with a warning before you remove the
note permanently.
 Delete several notes and/or histories. Eventually, you want to delete
certain notes or even histories. To delete several notes in one fell
swoop, just select the notes that you want to delete and then press the
Delete key:
• If you’re selecting several continuous notes, click the first note,
and then press the Shift key while clicking the last note that you
want to delete.
• If the entries aren’t continuous, press the Ctrl key while clicking
each note individually.
Now that you know how easy changing a history is, you may want
to prevent other users of your database from changing them. If
you’re the database administrator, choose Tools➪Preferences.
Then, on the General tab, remove the check mark next to the Allow
History Editing option.
 Copy a note. When you find duplicate contacts in your database, you
probably want to delete them — but not any notes attached to them. Or,
maybe you want a note from one contact record also attached to another
record. Luckily, ACT! gives you the ability to copy notes from one contact
to another contact with a simple copy-and-paste procedure:
a. Highlight the notes or histories that you want to copy and then
press Ctrl+C.
b. Find the contact where you want to insert the copied notes and, on
the Notes or History tab, press Ctrl+V.
If you’re feeling somewhat artistic, in need of a change, or just plain having
trouble with your forty-something eyesight, you may want to either add grid-
lines around your notes or change the color and/or font style. Or, you might
just decide to walk on the wild side and change the whole ball of wax. Take a
stroll down preference lane to accomplish this:
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from any ACT! screen.
The Preferences dialog box opens.
110
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

2. Click the Colors and Fonts tab.
3. Select the Notes tab.
4. Click the Font button to select a different font, style, or size.
5. Click OK to close the Font window.
6. Choose a text color and background color from the Appearance area.
7. Select the Show Grid Lines check box if you want gridlines to appear
on the Notes tab.
The ACT! gridlines are just like the gridlines you see in Excel. If you
change your preference to show gridlines, horizontal lines appear
between each of your notes and vertical lines between columns.
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 for the History tab.
9. Click OK.
Your Notes and History tabs are now modified according to the prefer-
ence settings that you selected.

 Scheduling activities
 Viewing ACT! calendars
 Using the Task List
 Sharing your activities with others
I
n this chapter, I show you how to schedule activities with your contacts,
how to view those activities and modify them if necessary, and even how
to find out whether you’ve completed a scheduled activity. You also discover
the intricacies of navigating through the various ACT! calendars, how to use
your Task List to keep you on top of your activities, and the joy of sharing a
list of your scheduled activities with others.
Scheduling Your Activities
One of the most useful of ACT!’s features is its ability to tie an activity to a con-
tact. More basic calendaring programs allow you to view your appointments
and tasks on your calendar, but they don’t offer a way of cross-referencing an
appointment to a contact. For example, if you schedule an appointment with
me and forget when that appointment is, you have to flip through your calen-
dar until you see my name. Plus, you can’t easily see a list of all appointments
that you’ve ever scheduled with me. But ACT! offers these helpful features.
In ACT!, every activity is scheduled with a specific contact. If the contact
doesn’t exist in your database, add the person to your database — or sched-
ule the appointment with yourself.
Here’s what you do to add an activity to your busy schedule:
1. Go to the contact with whom you’re scheduling an activity.
Here’s the drill. You create a lookup (I show you how in Chapter 7) to
find a prospect’s phone number. You call the guy, and afterward, you
want to schedule a meeting. At this point, you’re already on the contact
record of the person with whom you’re scheduling an activity.

2. Schedule a call, meeting, or to-do in one of three ways:
• Click the Call, Meeting, or To-Do icon on the toolbar in the Contact
Detail window or the Contact List.
• Choose Call, Meeting or To-Do from the Schedule menu in just
about any of the ACT! views.
• Double-click the appropriate time slot on any of the ACT! calendars.
Using different methods to schedule different activities is a smart plan 
of action. For example, I recommend scheduling meetings through the
calendars to make sure that you don’t have a conflict for a specific time
slot. When you’re scheduling calls and to-dos, however, which are gener-
ally “timeless” activities, you can simply click the corresponding icon on
the toolbar.
In any case, all roads lead to the Schedule Activity dialog box, shown in
Figure 9-1.
3. On the General tab, fill in the various options.
If Options is your name, ACT! is your game! The Schedule Activity dialog
box offers a myriad of scheduling options from which to pick, and ACT!
has thoughtfully filled in many of these options based on your default
scheduling preferences. (Chapter 3 walks you through changing some of
these preferences.) You can leave the information in the following fields
as is or override the default preferences:
• Activity Type: Choose Call, Meeting, To-Do, Personal Activity,
Support Ticket, or Vacation from the drop-down list.
• Date: Click the arrow to the right of the field to display the calen-
dar and select a start and end date.
Figure 9-1:

• Time: Enter a start and end time for the event. Choose Timeless for
the Start Time if you’re scheduling a call or to-do that doesn’t need
to occur at a specific time.
• Duration: Click the arrow to the right of the field to choose a dura-
tion for the activity. You can also manually specify a time range; an
hour-and-a-half-long meeting can be entered as either 90 m or 1.5 h.
The duration time is automatically set based on the starting and
ending times you specify. If you change the duration, ACT! auto-
matically adjusts the end time.
• Schedule With: The name of the current contact automatically
appears here. Select a different contact by typing the first few let-
ters of a contact’s last name to locate the contact in the list.
• Contacts: Click the Contacts button and then choose Select
Contacts to select more than one contact, New Contact to add a
new contact, or My Record to schedule a personal appointment.
• Priority: Choose High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low or Low.
• Schedule For/By: Click this button to assign a task to one of your
co-workers. (As if ACT! hasn’t made life easy enough for you
already!)
You might want to use these optional fields as well:
• Regarding: If you want to give a brief description of the activity,
type it here or choose an item from the drop-down list.
• Color: Click the arrow to the right of the field to display a color
palette, and then choose the color that you want to assign to the
activity. Feel free to design your own system of color-coding your
calendar.
• Ring Alarm: Sets an alarm to remind you of a scheduled activity.
• Use Banner: Lets you display a banner on the monthly calendar if
an activity involves one or more full days.
• Options: Allows you to confirm the activity with the contacts
involved and then send the meeting as an attachment in an ACT!
and/or Outlook format. You’re also offered a second option to
create a separate activity for each participant if you are scheduling
your activity with more than one contact.
4. On the Details tab, add additional details and print the details (if you
want).
These are two relatively important tasks:
• Details: Add additional information regarding an activity. For 
example, you may want to add special instructions about the 
items that you need to bring to a meeting.
• Print: This is where you can print the activity details.
115
Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

5. On the Recurrence tab, designate the activity as recurring if that’s the
case; otherwise, go to Step 6.
If the activity that you’re scheduling repeats on a regular basis, you can
designate it as a recurring activity rather than setting up several sepa-
rate activities. For example, if you’re taking a class that meets once a
week for the next 12 weeks, you can designate the class as a meeting
with a weekly recurrence. Be sure to specify the date on which the activ-
ity stops recurring.
Here are the recurring option settings:
• Daily: Select to schedule an activity that occurs daily and the date
on which the activity stops.
• Weekly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs weekly, on
which day or days of the week the activity is scheduled, and the
date on which the activity stops.
• Monthly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs monthly, the
weeks in the month when the activity is scheduled, the day of the
week the activity is scheduled, and the date on which the activity
stops.
• Yearly: Select to schedule an activity that occurs every year, and
the date on which the activity stops.
The Annual Event field can eliminate the need to set reminders for
activities, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and renewal dates.
Find out how to set up an Annual Event field in Chapter 15.
6. Click OK.
You now have a real, live scheduled activity!
After you create activities, ACT! is a worse nag than your mother! You can 
see your activities — and ACT! reminds you to complete them — in a number 
of ways:
 If you asked ACT! to ring the alarm when scheduling an activity, the ACT!
Alarms window (see Figure 9-2) appears at the specified time before the
activity is due. It also appears each time that you open ACT!.
 The Activities tab for a selected contact enables you to see what specific
activities you’ve scheduled with that particular contact.
 The Task List shows a listing of everything you’ve scheduled for all your
contacts during a specified time period.
 All ACT! calendars include a listing of the current day’s events.
Later in this chapter, in the section “Exploring Activities,” I show you how to
view, edit, clear, and share your scheduled activities.
116
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Regardless of your method of viewing your activities, remember this tip:
“When frustrated, check your filters.” If you’re just not seeing everything that
you know is supposed to be showing in your calendar — check your filters!
Not seeing anything scheduled for the future? Maybe your date range is set to
show the activities for today only. Seeing too much? Perhaps your filters are
set to show everyone’s Task List or calendar. Not seeing any of your activities
at all? Perhaps your filters are set to include everything except your own
activities!
Working with the ACT! Calendar
The various ACT! calendars are great for viewing scheduled tasks. Here are a
couple of ways to get to your calendars:
 Choose View and specify the type of calendar that you want to view.
 Click the calendar icon on the Nav bar.
Figure 9-2:
The Alarms
window

you of

117
Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

You can view your calendar in any one of four different ways, depending on
which way you feel the most comfortable:
 Daily Calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected
day as well as a listing of the day’s tasks (see Figure 9-3). The day is
divided into half-hour intervals.
Not happy with half-hour intervals? No problem; you can change that
default setting in ACT!’s preference settings. Not sure how to do that?
Take a peek at Chapter 3 to tweak your preferences.
 Work Week: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected week
as well as a listing of the day’s tasks (see Figure 9-4). Each day is repre-
sented by a single column and divided into half-hour intervals.
 Weekly Calendar: Shows the entire week including Saturday and
Sunday.
 Monthly Calendar: Shows you the time-specific activities of the selected
month as well as a listing of the day’s tasks (see Figure 9-5).

Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

The mini-calendar
The mini-calendar displays three months at one time (see Figure 9-6). The
mini-calendar works a little differently from the daily, weekly, and monthly
calendars. Press F4 to access the mini-calendar directly from the Contact
Detail window. Right-click the day that you want to check, and a small
window appears, displaying all activities scheduled for that day.
After you access any of the ACT! calendars, you can navigate to a different
date in one of the following ways:
 View today’s activities by pressing Ctrl+Home.
 Get a daily synopsis by right-clicking any day on the mini-calendar.
 Go to a different year by clicking the double arrows.
 Go to a different month by clicking the single arrows.
The Recap List
If you take a peek at any of the calendars (except for the mini-calendar), you
notice a little monthly calendar up at the top-right corner. This calendar pro-
vides you with a quick way to view a different calendar date by clicking it. A
miniature to-do list appears right below the calendar. That’s the Recap List.
The Recap List lists all your scheduled activities on a specific day.
You can only view the Recap List of one user at a time, but you can have
access to multiple users’ Recap Lists. When you select multiple users, buttons
with each user’s name appear in the Recap List. Click the user’s name to open
or close his Recap List. If a selected user has no scheduled activities for the
selected date, her name doesn’t display in the Recap List. To view another
user’s Recap List, follow these steps:
1. Click the Calendars icon on the Navigation bar.
2. Click the Select Users button.
The Select Users dialog box appears.
Figure 9-6:
A mini-
calendar.
120
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

3. Select the users whose Recap Lists you want to view, and then click OK.
I’m probably sounding like a broken record here, but remember that
your friend, the Ctrl key, is conveniently located on both sides of your
keyboard. If you press it, you can select more than one user by choosing
the name in the dialog box.
4. From the calendar, select the date for the Recap List you want to view.
The user’s tasks display in the Recap List (see Figure 9-7). If you selected
multiple users, you can click the button with the user’s name to view
that user’s tasks.
Using the Task List
Like the Honey Do list hanging from your husband’s workbench, the ACT!
Task List gives you a listing of all the activities for all your contacts.
The Task List is readily accessible by clicking the Task List icon on ACT!’s
Nav bar. Figure 9-8 shows a sample Task List.
You can filter the Task List by using different criteria (see Figure 9-8):
 The date range of the activities
 The type of activity
 The priority of the activity
 The users whose activities you want to view
 The cleared status of the activities
Creating a lookup from the Task List
Here’s the scenario. You wake up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to face
another new day. You get to the office, view your Task List, and stop dead in
your tracks: The length of your Task List is so long that you don’t even know
Figure 9-7:
The Recap
List.
121
Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

where to begin. Consider creating a lookup directly from the Task List. By
spending the first hour of your day sending out all those faxes and brochures
that you promised — and then the next hour returning your phone calls —
you get everything done.
When you break down your tasks into manageable pieces — instead of
having a breakdown yourself — the Task List becomes less intimidating.
Having said all that, I feel compelled to add that Rome wasn’t built in a day,
and you might not be able to complete all your tasks in a single day, either.
ACT! has a preference that enables you to roll over your tasks to the next 
day if necessary. Check out Chapter 3 for a quick refresher on changing ACT!
preferences.
1. To open your Task List, click the Task List icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
2. Select the date range of the activities for which you want to create a
lookup.
3. Select the activity types in the Types area to indicate the activities
that you want to work with.
4. Right-click the Task List and select Create Lookup.
ACT! creates a lookup of the selected activities. You can now scroll
through your contacts and work on all similar tasks at the same time.
Figure 9-8:
The ACT!

122
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Printing the Task List
As great as ACT! is, it can be totally useless if you don’t have access to a com-
puter or hand-held device. Or maybe you work with a technically challenged
co-worker (your boss?) who prefers to have a copy of his or her Task List
printed on a daily basis. No need to fret; ACT! can easily perform this task 
for you:
1. Click the Task List icon on the Nav bar.
2. Choose File➪Quick Print Current Window.
The Quick Report dialog box opens.
3. Click OK to print the Task List.
Exploring Activities
In the first section of this chapter, “Scheduling Your Activities,” I show you
how to do exactly that. After scheduling an activity, you’ll probably want to
take a look at it. Or edit it. Or clear it. Or maybe even share it with others. So
in this section, I show you how to do all these things.
Viewing the Activities tab
If you click the Activities tab at the bottom of the Contact Detail window,
ACT! displays all the activities scheduled with the current contact. This is 
a great way to have a list of all the activities that you’ve scheduled with a
contact.
You can see the Activities tab in Figure 9-9. You can filter your activities so
that only certain activities show on the Activities tab. Your choices include
 Dates to show
 Types to show
 Priorities to show
 Users
 Private activities
 Timeless activities
 Cleared activities
 Outlook activities
123
Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

Can’t find the filter options for Private, Timeless, Cleared, and Outlook activi-
ties? Click the Options button, and you’ll find them.
After you set your filters, you can also determine the columns that you want
to appear on the Activities tab. These are the possibilities:
 The type, date, time, and duration of the activity
 The priority that you set for the activity
 The regarding information and any details that you entered for the activity
 The company and contact name
 The name of the group that the activity might be associated with
 The contact’s phone number, extension, and e-mail address
 Additional activity details
 What ACT! user the activity was scheduled for and the ACT! user who
scheduled the activity
 Any attachments associated with the big event
After you determine the columns that you want to view on-screen, you can
easily print a down-and-dirty report. In Chapter 5, I give you all the juicy
details for rearranging the columns on the Activities tab — or on any other
ACT! list for that matter — and turning it into a Quick Print report.
Figure 9-9:
The
Activities
tab.
124
Part II: Putting the ACT! Database to Work 

Editing your activities
Like all the best-laid plans of mice and men, your activities will change, and
you need a way to make note of these changes in ACT!. Changing an activity
is all in the click — or in this case, the double-click — of the mouse. If you can
see an activity, you can edit it. That means you can edit your activities from
the Activities tab, the Task List, or from any of the ACT! calendars. The only
activities that you can’t change are those that you’ve already cleared.
Clearing activities
After you complete a task, clearing the task is very important. When you clear
a task, ACT! does several things:
 Stops reminding you about the activity
 Allows you to add some additional details about the activity
 Lets you schedule a follow-up activity if necessary
 Automatically updates the Last Reach, Last Meeting, or Last Attempt
fields with the current date
 Creates an entry on the History tab of the contact with whom you had
scheduled the activity
If you don’t clear your activities, you’re treated to a long list of alarms each
and every time you open ACT!. Not only is this annoying, it can also be dan-
gerous because you might also ignore current alarms!
To clear an activity, follow these steps:
1. Select the activity that you want to clear by doing one of the following:
• In any Calendar view, select the check box next to the activity in
the Recap List.
• In the Task List or on the Activities tab, click the check mark column.
• Right-click the activity and choose Clear Activity.
Using any method, the Clear Activity dialog box appears (see Figure 9-10).
The current date and time appear automatically. The Regarding informa-
tion that you had originally entered for the activity appears as well. This
information later appears in the Regarding column of the history that is
automatically created when you clear an activity.
The Clear Activity dialog box enables you to clear just one activity at a
time. You can clear multiple activities from the Activities tab or the Task
List:
a. Hold down the Ctrl key while selecting additional activities to clear.
125
Chapter 9: Playing the Dating Game

b. Right-click the selected activities and then choose Clear Multiple
Activities from the shortcut menu.
2. Select a Result option.
The result determines the type of note that’s added to the History tab as
well as the system field that is affected. For example, if you indicate that
a call was completed, two things happen:
• A history is added to the History tab with Call Completed showing
in the Type column.
• The Last Reach field is changed to include today’s date.
3. Select the Add Details to History check box if you want to edit or add
activity details.
Changes that you make to the Add Details area appear in the Regarding
field on the History tab for the contact.
4. Click the Follow Up Activity button to schedule a follow-up activity 
(if you want).
This is a very cool concept. When you clear an activity, ACT! gives you
the option of scheduling a follow-up activity. Schedule a follow-up
exactly like you schedule an original activity.
5. Schedule the follow-up activity in the Schedule Activity dialog box
and then click OK to return to the Clear Activity dialog box.
6. Click OK again, and you’re done.

 Scheduling an activity series
 Managing activity types
 Customizing results types and priorities
 Using annual events
O
ne common characteristic shared by most successful business people is
their ability to verbalize the routine procedures that they do on a daily
basis. In this chapter, you find out how to automate your procedures by cre-
ating an activity series. In Chapter 9, you discover how to create calendar
activities; in this chapter, I show you how to modify the Activity and Result
Type drop-down menus that you rely on when scheduling your activities.
Finally, I cover Annual Events fields and how you use them to send out birth-
day and anniversary greetings.
Creating an Activity Series
Quite simply, an activity series is a series of steps that you may want to
follow to achieve a specific goal. For example, you might have a six-step plan
of action for every prospect that heads your way, or seven things you need 
to do during each of your customer related projects. Every time you meet a
new prospect, you may want to lure him into using your services with a spe-
cific plan of action: send a brochure, follow it up with a phone call, send out 
a letter explaining some of the things you discussed in the phone call, and
then finally send an e-mail further explaining your business. After the prospect
becomes a customer, you may want to routinely send a welcoming letter, send
out a proposal, wait for approval, and then wait for the deposit check to slide
into your mailbox.
ACT! allows you to group these steps into one list in order for you to auto-
mate your process. By using an activity series, you can stick to your game
plan. And, hopefully, some of those hot prospects turn into customers

because you don’t allow any of them to fall through the cracks. After this is
created, you can schedule the series yourself or set a field trigger to automat-
ically schedule the series.
Using the Activity Series Template
Creation Wizard
Before you can schedule an activity series, you must create one using the
Activity Series Template Creation Wizard. Here’s where you develop the
series by naming it, setting it as public or private, and adding activities. The
wizard also allows you to edit or delete an existing activity series template.
Follow these steps to start the wizard:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Series Templates from any ACT!
screen.
2. In the Activity Series Template Creation Wizard, select the Create a
New Activity Series radio button, and then click Next.
The wizard walks you through the next three steps.
3. Fill in the name of your new activity series, indicate whether it’s
public or private, and then click Next.
Step 3 of the Activity Series Template Creation Wizard opens, as shown
in Figure 10-1.
4. Click the Add button to add all the steps you want to include in your
activity series.
The Add Activity dialog box opens; you can take a peek at it in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-1:
Creating an
activity
series.
130
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

5. Fill in the Add Activity dialog box and click OK.
Here’s where you indicate all the pertinent details for each and every
step of your activity series. You have to enter several key pieces of infor-
mation; don’t worry if you make a mistake because you can always go
back and edit these steps if you don’t get them right the first time.
• Activity Type: Indicate whether you’re scheduling a call, meeting,
to-do, or a custom activity (skip ahead to the “Adding custom
activity types” section, later in this chapter, for more info about
custom activities).
• Starts: Activity series are based on an anchor date. You can either
schedule an activity that occurs after the anchor date, or activities
that must be completed before the anchor date.
• Regarding, Priority, Color, and Ring Alarm: These fields are the
exact same ones you encounter when scheduling a regular, run-of-
the-mill activity.
• If Activity Falls on a Non-Working Day, Schedule on the
Following Work Day: Select this check box to prevent an activity
from being scheduled on a Saturday or Sunday.
• Schedule For: if you’re like me, you like nothing better than dele-
gating work on to another person. Here’s where you can assign
each Activity Series step to a poor, unsuspecting co-worker!
6. Repeat Step 5 as often as you need to and then click Next.
7. Indicate whether you want to schedule the series now or later and
click Finish.
Figure 10-2:

131
Chapter 10: Advanced Dating 101

Scheduling an activity series
After you create the template, you can schedule the series with one of your
contacts and set the anchor date. All the activities link together so that if one
activity changes to another date, you have the option to change only that
activity to another date or to reschedule all the remaining activities.
1. Create a lookup to find the contact or contacts with whom you want to
schedule the activity series.
I’ve warned you repeatedly that ACT! saves you lots and lots of time. If
scheduling an activity series with one person saves you time, just think
of what scheduling one with a bunch of people does for you!
2. Choose Schedule➪Activity Series.
The Schedule Activity Series dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-3.
3. Select the activity series template that you want to use, indicate the
anchor date, and click OK.
The activities are now scheduled and appear on the appropriate spots
on the contact’s Activities tab, the Task List, and on the calendars. You
might even notice that no time is associated with any of the activities;
that’s because activities scheduled as an activity series are automati-
cally timeless.
If you forgot to create a lookup or if you want to include a few more con-
tacts, you can do it. Select one contact from the With drop-down menu,
or select multiple contacts from the Contacts dialog box by clicking the
Contacts button and selecting Select Contacts.
Figure 10-3:
Scheduling
an activity

132
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

No conflict checking is performed when the activities are scheduled using an
activity series. Your tasks are scheduled regardless if you are already sched-
uled to be on vacation or off attending a conference in Kalamazoo.
Before scheduling the series with a large number of contacts, test the series
by scheduling it with just one contact. Then, take a gander at that contact’s
Activities tab to make sure that the activities appear in a logical sequence. If
something appears amiss, delete all the scheduled activities from the con-
tact’s Activities tab and read on.
Modifying an activity series
Mistakes happen — and you may make one when initially setting up your
activity series. Or you may wish to assign another employee to one of the
steps in the series. Not to worry; here’s all you need to do to modify the
series:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Series Templates.
2. Select Edit an Existing Activity Series radio button in the first screen
of the Activity Series Template Creation Wizard and then click Next.
3. Select the activity step that you wish to edit and click the Edit button.
4. Make the appropriate changes in the Add Activity dialog box and
click OK.
5. Click OK in the Schedule Activity Series window when you finish mod-
ifying all the activities.
Creating an Activity Series trigger
I have one other neat trick up my sleeve for you after you create an activity
series. You can set a field trigger to automatically schedule the series when
you leave, enter, or change a specific field.
1. Choose Tools➪Define Fields from any of the ACT! screens.
2. Select the field you want to add a trigger to and click Edit Field.
3. Click Next a few times until you arrive at the Select Trigger window. 
The Select Trigger window appears, shown in Figure 10-4.
4. Set one of the following trigger options:
• Select the Activity Series option from the When Changing a Field
Launch drop-down menu to set a trigger when the value in a field
changes.
133
Chapter 10: Advanced Dating 101

• Select the Activity Series option from the When Entering a Field
Launch drop-down menu to set a trigger when moving the cursor
into the field.
• Select the Activity Series option from the When Leaving a Field
Launch drop-down menu to set a trigger when moving the cursor
out of the field.
5. In the Activity Series Template field, select the activity series you
want to launch, and then click OK.
6. Click Finish.
Adding custom activity types
Out of the box, ACT! gives you five activity types: call, meeting, to-do, per-
sonal activity, and vacation. You can modify this list of activity types by creat-
ing a custom activity type. To add a custom activity type, just follow the
bouncing ball:
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Activity Types.
The Manage Activity Types dialog box appears, which bears a striking
resemblance to Figure 10-5.
2. Click Add.
The Add Activity Type dialog box appears, as seen in Figure 10-6.
• Type the name for the activity type in the Name field.
• Select the Active - Allow New Activities of This Type check box if
you want to allow users to schedule activities of this type.
Figure 10-4:
Linking an
Activity
Series
template to

134
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

3. Create the result options to use when the task is completed.
When you create an activity type, two types of results are automatically
assigned to it: Completed and Not Completed. You cannot delete these,
but you can edit them. You can also add new result types. When you add
a new result type, it’s available as an option when you clear an activity.
• Click the Add button to add a new result type.
• Click the Edit button to edit a result type.
4. Click OK in the Add Activity Type dialog box.
The activity type appears in the Activity Types list the very next time
you schedule an activity.
Don’t ask me why, but for some unknown reason, you can’t delete an activity
type after you create it. However, you can edit the activity and even change
the name of the activity type. Go figure!

Chapter 10: Advanced Dating 101

Editing priority types
If there is a square inch of ACT! that can’t be customized, I haven’t found it yet.
Even the priorities you use can when scheduling activities can be tweaked.
ACT! includes five basic priority types: High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-
Low, and Low. However, only three of the priority types (High, Medium and
Low) are “active.” A priority must have Active status in order for the Priority
List to include it in the Schedule Activity Series dialog box. And, although you
can’t add a new priority type, you can rename an existing one if you so desire.
1. Choose Schedule➪Manage➪Priorities from any of the ACT! screens.
The Manage Priorities dialog box opens, as seen in Figure 10-7.
2. Select the priorities you want to activate by selecting the check box in
the Active column.
3. Highlight a priority and then click the Edit button to change the name
of a priority.
4. Click OK when you finish editing the Priority List.
Using Annual Events
You can create Annual Event fields that help you track events for important
recurring dates such as birthdays, anniversaries, or annual policy renewals.
The whole purpose of an annual event is that it happens once a year, like it 
or not. More importantly, you can query on an Annual Event field by day or
month; for example, you could find all the January birthdays in your data-
base without having to know the exact year of the birthday.
Annual Event fields are set up like other date fields in ACT! and, like other
fields, can have specific options selected for them, such as whether the
annual event is a required field, generates a history, or is protected.
Figure 10-7:
The
Manage
Priorities
dialog box.
136
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Annual events do not display on calendars, but you can set a recurring to-do
activity and an alarm to notify you of them. For example, you might create a
to-do activity to remind you to create a lookup for all the birthdays occurring
each month.
Creating an Annual Event field
Follow these steps to create an annual event:
1. Choose Tools➪Define Fields from any of the ACT! screens.
2. Select the field you want to turn into an Annual Event field and click
Edit Field or click Create New Field and assign the field a name.
3. Select the Annual Event option from the Field Data Type drop-down
menu and click Finish.
Your final product looks something like Figure 10-8.
Creating a lookup of annual events
Follow these steps to create a lookup of your annual events:
1. Choose Lookup➪Annual Events.
As fast as you can say “abracadabra,” the Annual Events Search dialog
box, as shown in Figure 10-9, magically appears.
2. Select an event or events from the Search For drop-down menu.
ACT! allows you to search on more than one field at a time. For example,
you may wish to find everyone who has either a birthday or an anniver-
sary in the month of January.
Figure 10-8:

3. Select a time range from the Current Week, Current Month, or date
range options and then click the Find Now button.
After you find all the contacts that match your criteria, you have several
options available to you. You can
 View all contacts that match your criteria. Click the Create Lookup
button to look at your contacts on-screen or click the Print List button
to print the lookup.
 Display a specific contact record. Select the contact from the list and
then click the Go To Contact button.
 Schedule a recurring to-do activity for the event. Select a contact from

for sharing those reports with colleagues. You also find out about some of the
“non-reports” that are buried away in some unexpected places.
Knowing the Basic ACT! Reports
ACT! comes with a menu of over 30 basic reports right out of the box. In
Chapter 12, I show you how to customize existing reports or create new ones.
Here I list the basic reports, briefly describing each. Chances are good that at
least one of the basic ACT! reports gives you exactly the information that
you’re looking for.
If you really want to see first hand what each ACT! report looks like, consider
opening up the Act7Demo database and printing out the first page of each
report. Then, stick all the reports in a notebook. If you want to get really
fancy, stick them in sheet protectors first. That way, if you ever need to run a
report, you can go back to your printouts for a quick reference before you
start running a lot of unnecessary reports.

The first three reports in the ACT! Reports menu are probably among the
most useful because they supply you with information for each of your con-
tacts. You can determine which one best suits your needs by deciding
whether you want to view a page, a paragraph, or simply one line of informa-
tion about your contact.
 Contact Report: A one-page report showing all the contact information
for each contact, including the notes, history, and activities.
 Contact Directory: Prints the primary address and home address for
each contact in paragraph form.
 Phone List: Prints the company name, company phone number, phone
extension, and mobile phone number for each contact; the report dis-
plays one line of content for each contact.
The next several reports display information that’s pertinent to you and your
notes and activities:
 Activities: Shows you the scheduled and completed calls, meetings, and
to-do’s scheduled with each contact during a specified date range. The
Task List is sorted by contact so that you can see a listing of all the time
that you’ve spent — or are scheduled to spend — with any given contact.
 History Summary: Produces a list of every attempted call, completed
call, meeting held, letter sent, and field changed for each contact during
a specified date range sorted by contact. Figure 11-1 shows you the top
part of an unfiltered History Summary report.
 History Summary Classic: Shows the numerical total of attempted calls,
completed calls, meetings held, and letters sent for each contact during
a specified date range sorted by contact.
The History Summary report displays only those contacts that you’ve
contacted during a specific date range. The History Summary Classic
report, however, displays a list of all your contacts, including contacts
that you have contacted as well as those that you have not contacted. If
you end up producing a 50-page report, I suggest creating a Contact
Activity lookup before running the report. If you need help with creating
a lookup, turn to Chapter 7.
 History Time Spent: Shows the date, time, duration, and information
regarding activities scheduled with each contact during a specified date
range. You get a subtotal of the time that you’ve spent with each contact
as well as of the time that you’re still scheduled to spend with them — if
you assign a time duration to your meetings, calls, and to-do’s.
140
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

The next two reports are based on information in two of the key ACT! fields:
 Contact Status: Shows you the ID/Status, last reach, last meeting, and
last results for each contact during a specified date range. You’ll likely
want to create a Contact Activity lookup before running this report to
avoid having a lot of empty contact information in your final report.
 Source of Referrals: Changing certain default fields isn’t a good idea.
Here’s one reason why: The Source of Referrals report relies on the infor-
mation in the Referred By field. Figure 11-2 shows you an example of the
Source of Referrals report and plainly shows what happens if you don’t
enter data consistently. Dave Davis and David Davis are probably the
same person, yet they show up in two different spots in the report.
 Other Contact Reports: This is a good place to store other reports that
you might have created. You also find two additional reports, E-Mail List
and Fax List, stored here.
You can find the Group reports together in a subsection of the main Reports
menu. These reports give you different ways to view the information in your
groups. If you aren’t using groups (which I explain fully in Chapter 21), these
reports might not be of any benefit to you.
 Group Membership: Lists all groups and their members.
 Group Summary: Lists the notes, histories, and activities for all groups
or for specific groups.
 Group Comprehensive: Lists all information (including notes, histories,
and activities) for each group, subgroup, and their respective members.
Figure 11-1:

Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

 Group List: Lists all groups and their description from the Group
Description field.
 Other Group Reports: This is a great place to store your own cus-
tomized group reports.
You find the Company reports together in a subsection of the main Reports
menu. These reports give you different ways to view the information in your
companies. If I sound like a broken record, it’s because the five Group reports
that I mentioned earlier all come in a “company version.”
ACT! provides you with a variety of Opportunity reports, funnels, and graphs.
The Opportunity reports use information inputted onto the Opportunities
tab. If you aren’t using the Opportunities feature (head to Chapter 20 for the
lowdown), you can’t use these reports. The Opportunity Reports are all
housed in a separate Opportunity section in the Reports menu.
 Totals by Status: Garners totals of all sales opportunities and sorts them
by Closed/Won Sales, and Lost Sales.
 Adjusted for Probability: Lists all sales opportunities by contact, with
totals.
 Pipeline Report: Gives information about sales opportunities at each
stage in the sales process.

 Opportunities by Record Manager: Lists sales opportunities,
Closed/Won Sales, and Lost Sales sorted by Record Manager.
 Opportunities by Contact: Provides complete sales information for each
contact with a sales opportunity or a closed sale.
 Opportunities Graph: Gives forecasted or closed sales, in a bar or line
graph.
 Opportunities Pipeline: Gives the number of sales opportunities at each
stage of the sales process, in a graphical form.
 Other Opportunity Reports: Check in this section for a number of addi-
tional opportunity reports including Gross Margin reports, opportunity
reports by company and or group, and a Sales by Reason report.
Running an ACT! Report
The following steps apply to all ACT! reports. The dialog box is the same for
all reports. Depending on the report that you’re running, however, some of
the options may be unavailable and thus appear grayed out.
To run an ACT! report, just follow these steps:
1. Perform a lookup or display the contact record or records that you
want to include in the report.
All roads in ACT! lead — or at least pass by — the lookup. Before running
a report, decide which contact’s or group’s data you want to include in
your report. For example, you may run a History Summary Report for a
single contact or a Contact Report for all contacts in a state or region.
You can include data from the current contact or group record, the cur-
rent contact or group lookup, or from all contacts or groups.
2. Sort the contacts before running the report if you want the contacts in
the report to appear in a particular order.
Do you want the contacts to appear alphabetically by company name or
by last name? If you have numerous contacts with the last name Smith,
do you then want to sort them by company or state? You must make
these decisions before running an ACT! report.
Sort your contacts in one of two ways: Sort by up to three criteria by
choosing Edit➪Sort, or sort your contact by a criterion by clicking the
appropriate contact heading in the Contact List.
3. Choose the Reports menu and then select the name of the report that
you want to run. To run a report that doesn’t appear in the menu,
choose Reports➪Other Contact Reports and select the appropriate
report.
143
Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

The Define Filters dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-3. The General
tab is identical for any and all ACT! reports that you create.
4. In the Send the Report Output To drop-down list, select an output for
the report:
• Preview: Choose the Preview option if you’re at all hesitant about
your reporting capabilities. A preview of the report appears on-
screen. After previewing the report, print it or run it again if it isn’t
looking exactly the way that you intended it to look.
• Rich-Text File: Saves the report as an RTF file, which you can open
in Word.
• HTML File: Saves the report as an HTML file. Choose this option if
you want to use the report on your Web site.
• PDF File: Saves the report as a PDF file that can be read in Adobe
reader.
• Text File: Saves the report as a TXT file, which you can read with a
wide variety of software, including Excel.
• Printer: If you’re fully confident that your report will print cor-
rectly the first time, go for it! This option sends the report directly
to your default printer.
• E-mail: Sends the saved report as an attachment to an e-mail mes-
sage. The attachment has an .rpt extension and can be read only
by recipients who have ACT! installed on their computers.
5. In the Create Report For area, specify the contacts to include in the
report.
The choices are self-explanatory. You’re either going to run the report
for the current contact, the current lookup, or all contacts.
Figure 11-3:
The Define

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

If you sorted the contacts, select the Current Lookup radio button, 
even if you want to include all contacts in the database. If you don’t
select this option, the contacts in the report don’t appear in the sort
order that you specified.
6. Select the Exclude ‘My Record’ check box to exclude information
from your My Record in the report.
This option is not available for all reports.
7. In the Use Data Managed By area, select the Record Manager of the
contacts that you’re including in your report.
• All Users: Includes contact records managed by all users of the
database.
• Selected Users: Includes contact records managed by selected
users of the database. If you’re the only user of the database, only
your name appears in the list.
8. On the Activities, Note, and/or History tabs, make the appropriate
selections.
• On the Activities tab, select the type of activities and the corre-
sponding date range of the activities to include in your report.
• On the Note and History tab, select the type of histories and the
corresponding date range that you’re including in your report.
• In the Use Data Managed By area, select the users whose informa-
tion you want to include in the report.
9. Click the Opportunity tab if you’re running a Sales report.
Figure 11-4 shows the Opportunity tab that appears in the various sales
report.

Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

• In the Sale Opportunities area, select whether you want to include
Sales Opportunities, Closed/Won Sales, and/or Lost Sales in your
report.
• In the Within Date Range drop-down menu, specify the date range
of the Sales Opportunities to include in the report.
• In the Use Data Managed By area, choose to include information
from All Users or Selected Users of your database.
10. Click OK.
ACT! runs the report. If you aren’t happy with the results, run the same
report a second time by using different criteria, or try running a different
report. Better yet, read Chapter 12 to discover how to create your very
own ACT! reports.
Printing Address Books
Printing an address book is probably one of the more common tasks used by
ACT! users, and ACT! makes the chore an extremely simple one to perform.
Creating a hard copy of your ACT! address book is basically a three-step
process:
1. Add all your contact information into your ACT! database, making sure
that your information is as complete as possible.
2. Create a lookup of the contacts that you want to include in your address
book.
Of course, you may want to include all your contacts in the print copy of
your address book. You might even want to print separate address
books for each of the different types of contacts in your database.
3. Choose the format for your address book.
Those are the basic steps. The following step includes all the down-and-dirty
details for creating your own printed address book:
1. Create a lookup if you intend on printing only a portion of your
address book.
Refer to Chapter 7 if you need a refresher course in creating an ACT!
lookup.
2. From any of the ACT! windows, choose File➪Print.
Okay, I know you’re probably scratching your head wondering why I’m
asking you to print when you haven’t created anything yet. That’s the
concept with these non-reports: They aren’t actually reports by defini-
tion, so ACT! just threw them into the Print menu. Go figure!
146
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

The Print dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-5.
3. Choose Address Book from the Printout Type area.
4. Select the paper type for printing the address book.
ACT! enables you to print contact addresses and phone numbers in a
variety of commonly used paper formats, including
• At-A-Glance
• Day Runner
• Day Timer
• Franklin
You can print all your ACT! information onto preformatted addressing
systems. ACT! provides you with the most popular, commercially avail-
able, addressing systems. The preprinted forms are available at any of
the large office supply warehouse stores. If you are currently using an
address system from one of these manufacturers, choose it from the
Paper Type list.
Figure 11-5 shows you some of your choices. You might notice that the
Edit Template button is grayed out. That’s because you can’t make
changes to the Address Book templates.
Of course, if you don’t want to spend the money on preprinted forms, or
you just want a printout of your address book on a plain sheet of paper,
you can always use my particular favorite form for printing an address
book: plain paper.
A preview of the selected printout appears in the Preview pane on the
right.
5. Click the Options button to specify the information to include in the
address book.

Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

The Address Book Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-6.
6. In the Print area, select the fields to include in your address book:
• Primary Address: Prints the contact’s main address
• Secondary Address: Prints the contact’s home address
• Phone Numbers: Prints all contact’s phone numbers, including
Work, Alt, Phone, Fax, Mobile Phone, Home Phone, and Pager
• Alternate Contacts: Prints the second and third contacts’ names
and phone numbers
• E-mail Address: Prints the contact’s e-mail addresses
7. In the Additional fields drop-down menus, add up to three additional
fields.
The choices in Step 6 are based on the default fields that come with
ACT!. If you’ve added several new phone number fields, they don’t
appear in the printout of your address book, but ACT! allows you to add
up to three additional fields.
8. In the Print Settings area, select your printing option.
Here’s where you get to determine how your address book is going to
print:
• Double Sided Printing: Prints the address book on both sides of
the page
• Break Page on New Letter: Starts a new page for each letter of the
alphabet
Figure 11-6:

• Letter at Top of Each Page: Prints the current alphabetic letter at
the top of each page
• Lines Between Contacts: Prints a line between contact entries
• European Postal Format: Prints the postal code before the city
9. In the Sort Order drop-down menu, select the order in which you
want entries to appear in your address book — alphabetically either
by company name or contact last name.
10. In the Create Printout For drop-down menu, specify whether to
include the Current Contact, the Current Lookup, or All Contacts.
11. If desired, change the Font Size option.
12. Click OK.
The Print dialog box re-appears.
13. Click the Print button.
14. Click OK in the Windows Print dialog box.
15. Run to your printer and admire your newly printed address book.
Creating Mailing Labels and Envelopes
All right. You’ve created a brochure that’s guaranteed to knock the socks
right off of your customers — and potential customers. Now all you have to
do is send those puppies out in the mail. There is no easier method to do this
than by creating mailing labels or envelopes using ACT!.
Some of you may be snickering about now because you’re much too sophisti-
cated to be using snail mail. You’ve probably already raced over to Chapter 13
to find out how to create e-mail blasts. You might still use the ACT! labels to
create everything from file tabs to name badges.
You print out labels and envelopes in ACT! in exactly the same way. At first
glance, printing envelopes in ACT! to match a customized letter template
seems like a great idea. After all, they look a lot more personalized than an
ordinary mailing label. However, if your mailing entails sending personalized
letters to a large number of people, you may want to rethink your decision.
Unless you have a specially designed envelope tray, you’re probably going to
have to print your envelopes in batches. But remember that 30 envelopes are
much bulkier and harder to store than a page of 30 labels. While you print
each batch of envelopes, you have to make sure that they remain in the exact
same order as your letters, or matching them to the corresponding letter
could become a nightmare.
149
Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

If you’re printing envelopes, I suggest limiting the number of envelopes that
you print at any one time. If you’re just printing a single envelope for one
person to go with a letter that you just created using a document template,
using your word processor to create the envelope is probably easier than using
ACT!. ACT! automatically asks whether you want to print an envelope after you
create a document using a document template. (See Chapter 13 for the details.)
To create labels or envelopes using ACT!, just follow these steps:
1. Create a lookup of the contacts for whom you want to create labels or
envelopes.
If you’re creating a personalized mailing, I’d guess that you’ve already
created a lookup of the contacts that get the mailing. By creating the
corresponding labels using the existing lookup, you’re guaranteed to
have the same number of contacts and to have your labels print in the
same sort order.
2. Choose File➪Print from any ACT! window.
3. Choose Labels or Envelopes from the Printout Type list.
From this point forward, I focus on creating labels, but these directions
also work for envelopes. Just substitute the word envelope for the word
label in any of the directions.
4. Select a template from the list and click the Print button.
The available label templates are listed on the Paper Type area of the
dialog box.
Notice that all the labels are Avery labels. Chances are that even if
you’re using a generic label, you find the magic words “Same as Avery
Label #XX” printed on the side of the box.
The Define Filters dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-7.
5. In the Send the Report Output To drop-down menu, select to immedi-
ately print or to first preview the labels.
Previewing the labels before printing them is always a good idea. You
can print them directly from the Preview screen if everything looks
hunky-dory.
6. In the Create Report For area, specify whether you want to create
labels for the Current Contact, the Current Lookup, or All Contacts.
If you’ve sorted your database, choose the Current Lookup option even
if you are printing your entire database.
7. Select All Users or Selected Users from the Use Data Managed By area.
This option refers to the Record Manager of each contact. You might
want to print labels for just your own contacts.
8. Click OK.
You’re now the proud owner of a beautiful set of labels.
150
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Modifying Labels and Envelopes
You may decide that your labels need a little extra pizzazz. Maybe you want
to add another field or make a field longer. Maybe you think a font change is
in order. All modifications that you may have in mind can be accomplished
from the label template editor:
1. Choose File➪Print from any ACT! screen.
2. Choose Labels or Envelopes from the Printout Type list.
3. Click the Edit Template button to make modifications to an existing
label template (if you want to make modifications).
The Label Designer dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-8. The Label
Designer toolbox also opens; you recognize this toolbox if you design
layouts or reports in ACT!.
4. Before making adjustments to the existing label formats, save the tem-
plate using another name by choosing File➪Save As, typing the name
of the template in the File Name field, and then clicking OK.
The next time that you run a set of labels, the template that you create
appears as one of the label template choices.
5. Modify the label formats to your heart’s content:
• To delete a field: Click the Pointer tool in the toolbox, click a field,
and then press Delete.
• To move a field: Click the Pointer tool in the toolbox and drag a
field to a new position.
Figure 11-7:

Chapter 11: Using the Basic ACT! Reports

• To change the font for a field: Double-click a field and then choose
the Font menu to specify a different font, size, or attribute.
• To add a field: Click the Field tool and draw a rectangle to indicate
where you want to place the field. You’re then prompted to select
the name of the field you wish to add.
• To close the template: Choose File➪Close and then click Yes to
save.
6. Click OK.
If the label that you ordinarily use isn’t listed, changing your labels to corre-
spond to one of the labels listed in ACT! is probably your easiest choice. But
if you rely on a special label, you can create a document template that corre-
sponds with the dimensions of your labels. Check out Chapter 12 to find out
how to create custom templates.
Working with Quick Report
I like to think the ability to print the various ACT! lists and tabs as somewhat
of a secret weapon. By being able to print these lists, you can report quickly
on just about anything that you can view throughout your database. This
ability enables you to quickly create a report based on the specifications and
criteria that you need immediately.
You’re able to create a Quick Report for the following ACT! lists:
 Contact List
 Task List
 Group List
 Company List
Figure 11-8:
The Label
Designer
dialog box.
152
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

You can also create a Quick Report for the following system tabs in the
Contact, Group, or Company Detail windows:
 Notes
 History
 Activities
 Opportunities
 Groups/Companies
 Secondary Contacts
 Documents
Basically, if you’re viewing a list, such as the Task List, ACT! can print the list.
If you’re viewing a tab that contains a list of items, such as the Notes, History,
or Opportunities tab, ACT! can print those items.
Creating a Quick Report
Follow these steps to create a report:
1. Display the list view or tab that you want to print.
• To display a tab, click the tab from the Contact, Group, or
Company Detail window.
• To display a list, such as the Task List or Contact List, choose View
and then the appropriate list.
2. Arrange the columns exactly as you want them to appear on your
hard copy printout.
If you need help adding or removing columns, or changing the order or
size of existing columns, check out Chapter 5.
All lists that you see in ACT! work in exactly the same way.
3. Choose File➪Quick Print Current Window.
The Windows Print dialog box opens.
4. Click OK.
Setting the Quick Report preferences
Quick Print preferences allow you to modify the content of the headers and
footers that appear on your Quick Reports.

Designing Your Own Reports
In This Chapter
 Using the ACT! Report Designer
 Modifying an existing ACT! report
 Filtering report content
 Creating report sections
A
CT! comes with more than 30 reports right out of the box. Surely one 
of these reports can give you exactly the information that you need.
Chapter 11 shows you how to run any of the existing ACT! reports. In this
chapter, I show you how to create brand new reports or modify an existing
one. If, after designing a report, you want to add it to the Reports menu, 
head to Chapter 3 where I show you how.
Understanding the Report Designer
Designing a database report can be a bit intimidating if you’ve never done it
before. I like to think that you can tackle the chore of creating a report in one
of two ways: the hard way or the easy way. The hard way consists of creating
a brand new report entirely from scratch, which entails placing each and
every element of your report onto a blank report template. The easy way con-
sists of taking an existing report that is “kind of” what you’re looking for and
modifying it.
You might want to open the Act7demo database and print out a page of each
of the existing ACT! reports for reference. Doing so helps you decide which
report works as the best starting point for your modifications.
Being familiar with the structure of your existing database can prove helpful
when you attempt to create a report. Thus, you need to know the field names
that you’re working with as well as their location in ACT!. For example, if you

want to include the name of a company, you must know that the field is called
Company and that you find the field in the Contact Detail window. If you want
to include notes that you’ve added, you must know to include the Regarding
field from the Notes tab.
Before starting to create or modify a report, create a lookup of the contacts
that you’re including in your report. This step is optional but can be timesav-
ing. As you design your report, you’ll notice that sometimes certain fields
aren’t large enough to contain their data or that columns don’t line up cor-
rectly. By creating a lookup, you can check the progress of your report-
designing efforts each time that you add a new element to your report.
Naming Your ACT! Report
After you pick the report you want to modify — or decided that you are a
glutton for punishment, and start from scratch — you’re ready to begin.
1. Choose the Reports menu from any ACT! screen.
You have two choices here:
• New Template: Even if you choose this option, ACT! shows you a
list of all the report templates. The top choice, Empty Report, is
the one you want to choose if you’re adventurous enough to want
to start working without a net.
Yikes! The problem with designing an ACT! report from scratch is
that you have to create the report from scratch. As shown in Fig-
ure 12-1, a blank template with Header, Contact, and Footer section
titles appears on the left.
• Edit Template: For me and most ACT! users, this choice is safer.
You can now open the report that most closely matches your
desired results. Compare Figures 12-1 and 12-2 to see the difference
between a blank report and an existing one.
Notice that there appears to be duplicate fields. The first field that you
see is the Field label. You can edit any of these labels by clicking the
Text icon on the toolbox, clicking the label, and then typing in any
desired changes.
You can distinguish the field itself by the colon that appears in each
field. The actual data from your ACT! database appears in this area when
you run the report. The letter in front of the colon indicates the Field
type. For example, if you add your name in the Header section, the field
appears as My:Contact. If you add a contact’s company, it appears on
the report template as C:Company.

Chapter 12: Designing Your Own Reports

2. From the Report Designer, choose File➪Save As.
I highly recommend giving your report a brand new name even if you’re
just tweaking an existing report. That way, you still have the original
report to go back to, just in case.
3. Fill in a name for your new report and then click Save.
Saving early and often
Creating a report requires a great deal of patience. Even the most expert of
report designers run into problems at times or (gasp) make a mistake. Imagine
how you’d feel if after spending several hours working on a report, you made 
a huge mistake without realizing it until you ran your report for the first time.
You would be heading back to the drawing board, and none too happily, I might
add. For that reason, I suggest that you keep repeating the following procedure
each and every time you make a change to the structure of your report.
From the Report Designer, choose File➪Print Preview and give your report a
good examination:
 If you like what you see, close Print Preview and choose File➪Save. Your
changes are now safe and sound.
 If something is wrong in Houston, or at least somewhere in the body of
your report, close Print Preview and close the Report Designer without
saving your changes. Cutting your losses is easier now rather than
trying to untangle the mess you might inadvertently create later on.
Using the toolbox and properties
An ACT! report template consists of a number of elements. For example, you
might have your company logo at the top of your report, and a series of
column headings that appear at the top of each page in your report. ACT!’s
Report Designer lets you modify those various elements using the toolbox
and Properties features.
Tooling around in the toolbox
If you refer to Figure 12-2, you see the toolbox running along the left-hand
side of the Report Designer. It consists of the following eight options:
 Pointer: You must click the Pointer in order to select any element in the
Report Designer that you wish to modify.
 Field: Click this option if you want to add a new field to the body of your
report.
158
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

 Text: This option allows you to create a descriptive text box.
 Rectangle: As its name implies, this option allow you to draw a box or
rectangle in your report. Use this option to highlight a section of your
report.
 Picture: This option allows you to add a graphic, such as your company
logo, to your report.
 Picture Field: This allows you to add a contact’s picture to your report.
 System Field: This allows you to add fields including date, time, and
number of pages in your report.
 Subreport: This shows multiple objects for each contact in a report. For
example, you may want to show the contact information for each con-
tact listed on a sales report.
Using the properties properly
In addition to the toolbox, the Report Designer comes equipped with a
Properties window guaranteed to give you more options than your local ice
cream store. The Properties window runs along the right side of the Report
Designer (refer to Figure 12-2). You can see what I mean by the options avail-
able to you. The purpose of the Properties window is to show you all the
applied formatting to any given element.
Feel like the toolbox or Properties window is infringing on your territory? You
can minimize them out of the way by clicking the thumbtack in the upper-
right corner. Want to bring it back? Simply click the word toolbox, which now
appears on the left side or “properties” that now appears on the right side of
the Report Designer.
If you want to move the toolbox or Properties window out of the way, just
double-click the window title bar. Each of these windows now detach them-
selves from the side of your screen. At this point, you can drag them to what-
ever area of the Report Designer that you are not using.
The left side of the Properties window lists all the aspects available for the ele-
ment you selected. The right side shows you the currently selected choice. If
you want to change any particular aspect, simply click the option on the right
side and choose a different formatting option from the drop-down list that
appears. For example, if I want to change a font color from black to red, I click
the word black that appears to the right of the font color and choose red from
the drop-down list.
You can also use the Properties window to change the attributes of several
elements at the same time. You can click several elements at the same time by
holding down the Shift key while clicking the elements you want to change.
Once selected, you can change as many attributes as you want all in one fell
swoop.

Chapter 12: Designing Your Own Reports

Changing the Report Content
I mention earlier that chances are that you began with a basic report and
decided to modify it somewhat — or even give it a complete makeover.
Probably the first thing you want to do is decide which fields will — or won’t —
appear in your report. After you make that momentous decision, you may
decide that you want to tweak the order of the fields. Of course, then you’re
going to have to realign some of the fields that you moved so that they line up
in an orderly fashion. You also have to decide how long a field should be — for
example, the State field only needs to house two letters, but the City field may
need to hold thirty. Whew! You have a lot of work to do, so read on!
Working with existing fields
Start by tweaking some of the fields already on your report template. Like
anything else, it’s simple if you know the trick.
1. From the Report Designer, click the Pointer icon in the toolbox.
2. Select the fields you want to modify.
To select multiple fields hold down the Shift key while clicking any addi-
tional fields.
You can identify selected fields by the handles that now appear along
their edges and centers.
After you select the fields you want to work with, you can change a field in a
number of ways:
 To change field properties: Select an item from the Report Designer
Properties window and edit the properties. You can also select font
attributes such as bolding, centering, and size from the Report Designer
icon bar.
 To delete a field or a field label: Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
 To resize a field: Grab one of the selection handles on either side of
field and drag to either the left or right depending on whether you want
the field larger or smaller.
 To move a field: Place your cursor in the middle of a field or group of
fields and drag them to the desired location.
 To align fields: First select the anchor field and then additional fields.
The anchor field is the one that is correctly placed on the report tem-
plate; all subsequent fields are the ones that you want align horizontally
or vertically with the anchor field. Choose Format➪Align from the
Report Designer menu and indicate how to line up the fields.
160
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

You can distinguish between the anchor field and the other fields that you
select by carefully examining the selection handles. If you look at Figure 12-3,
the anchor field has filled-in handles whereas the secondary field has “open”
handles.
Adding a field
If you want to add a field to a template, follow these steps:
1. In the Report Designer, click the Field button in the toolbox.
2. Place your cursor on the template where you want to insert a field and
drag down and to the right to define the field’s length and position.
Most probably, you want to add the new field to the Detail section of
your report. However, you can also add fields to any of the other sec-
tions as well.
When you release the mouse button, the Select Field dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 12-4. You can now choose any of your existing ACT!
fields to add to the report templates.

Field dialog
box.

and sec-
ondary

161
Chapter 12: Designing Your Own Reports

3. Select the record type that you want to add from the Select a Record
Type drop-down list.
Typically, you want to add a new Contact field to the body of your
report. However, you may decide to add My Record fields to the header
so that “your” name and other pertinent information appears at the top
of the report. You may want to include Secondary Contact information.
You can even choose to add Activity, History, Note, and Opportunity
fields to your report.
As you make a record type selection, notice that the list of fields
changes. If you decide to add a Note field the choices include Date and
Time whereas a selection of Contact Opportunity allows you to include
any of your Opportunity fields.
4. Indicate whether you want to include a field label.
If you don’t want to include a field label for a field in the template, dese-
lect the Include a Label check box.
5. Click the Add button.
The Report Designer now contains the fields and field labels that you
added. Refer to Figure 12-2 for an example of a report template that con-
tains several sections, subsections, and fields.
6. Continue adding additional fields if desired. Click the Close button
when you finish adding new fields.
Adding a summary field
After you add a field to a report template, you may want to make it a sum-
mary field. Examples of summary fields include having a count of all the con-
tacts that appear in a report or a total for a column containing numeric data.
1. Double-click the field in the Report Designer that you want to convert
into a summary field.
The Field Properties dialog box appears.
2. Click the Data tab and select the Summary option from the Field Type
area.
You can check out the Data tab of the Field Properties dialog box in
Figure 12-5.
After you create a summary field, you’ll recognize it because ACT! inserts sev-
eral letters in front of the field name. To make life easy for you, I include clues
for you in the parentheses. The types of summary fields you can have are
162
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

 Count (count): This field counts the number of records for the selected
field.
 Total (sum): This field calculates the total of all values in the selected
field.
 Average (avg): This field calculates the average of all values in the
selected field.
 Minimum (min): This field finds the lowest number or earliest date in
the selected field.
 Maximum (max): This field finds the highest number or latest date in
the selected field.
Filtering Data in a Report Template
Just like you can filter heaven knows what out of your water, you can filter
data out of a report. You can change the filters each time that you run a
report, or you can include filters in your report template to save you from
having to do it later. Any filters that you set become defaults that you can
change later when you actually run the report. Here’s all you need to do to
add that timesaving feature to your report templates.
1. Choose Edit➪Define Filters from the Report Designer.
The Define Filters dialog box appears. You can sneak a peek at it in
Figure 12-6.
Figure 12-5:
Creating a
summary
field.
163
Chapter 12: Designing Your Own Reports

The Define Filters dialog box is divided into five tabs. Depending on the
type of report you are creating, some of the tabs may not be available:
• General: Selects the default output for the report, the contacts to
include, and the Record Manager of the contacts
• Activity: Lets you select whether you want to include calls, meet-
ings, to-do’s, and cleared activities within a given date range
• Note: Lets you specify the date range and creator of the notes to
appear in a report
• History: Lets you determine whether you want to include histo-
ries, e-mails, and attachments within a given date range
• Opportunity: Lets you filter for Sales Opportunities, and Closed
and Lost Sales within a given date range
2. Select the data to include in the report from the Activity, Note,
History, and Opportunity tabs, and then click OK.
Sectioning Your ACT! Report
You create sections in a report template to help you organize the information
that you want to include in your report. The fields that you include in each
section vary based on the type of report you are creating. For example, in a
Contact Report, you add Contact fields to the sections; and in an Opportunity
Report, you add Opportunity fields.
Figure 12-6:
The Report
Designer

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Defining report sections
A report template is divided into sections of information. You can determine
which fields you want to appear in each given section. A report template con-
sists of five main sections; you can’t delete or change the order of the sec-
tions, but you can hide a section if you don’t want it to appear in your report:
 Report Header: Information that appears at the top of the report, such
as the report’s title and creator.
 Page Header: Information that appears at the top of each page, such as
column headings.
 Detail: The area that contains one or more of your Contact or Group
fields. The Detail section is the meat and potatoes of the report where
you find pertinent information, such as the contact’s name, address, and
phone number.
 Page Footer: Information that appears at the bottom of each page in
your report, such as the date and page number.
 Footer: Information that appears at the bottom of your report, such as a
recap or a grand total.
Each section has a section title that appears in the report template but doesn’t
appear in the report itself. You can resize a section to make room for addi-
tional fields by dragging the horizontal gray line that appears at the bottom
of the section lower on the template.
After you fiddle with your report template and have it exactly the way you
want it, don’t forget to resize each section back to the original size — or close
it up as much as possible. Any blank areas in a section appear as blank areas
in your report!
Modifying report sections
Most of you will be quite happy to rely on the five default report sections.
However, from time to time, you may want to create subsection within your
report. Not a problem; here’s all you need to do:
1. In the Report Designer, double-click any section header.
The Define Sections dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-7. You can
choose a few other options as well:
165
Chapter 12: Designing Your Own Reports

• Page Break: Indicates whether you want to have each section
appear on a new sheet of paper
• Collapse if Blank: Closes up a section if no information is con-
tained in it
• Allow Section to Break Across Multiple Pages: Allows a long sec-
tion to continue on to multiple pages
2. Select the section to which you want to add a subsection.
In most cases, you want to add a subsection to the Details section of
your report.
3. Click the Add button to add a new section to the report.
The Select a Field to Group By dialog box opens.
4. Select the field you want to use to subtotal your report and click OK.
In Figure 12-8, you can see how I decided to subtotal my reports by city.
5. Select an ascending order.
From the Define Sections dialog box, indicate whether the new section
appears in alphabetical order.
After you create a new subsection, you can place as many fields on it as you
want using the techniques in the “Adding a field” section.

Hiding a report section
Although you can’t remove any of the default report template sections, you
can hide them, which gives you the same result. To hide a section:
1. In the Report Designer, open the Properties window by choosing
View➪Properties Window.
2. Select the name of the section you wish to hide.
3. Click the Visible property in the Properties window and change it
to No.
Although you can still see the section in the Report Designer, it doesn’t
appear in your finished reports.

Merging Your Information 
into a Document
In This Chapter
 Understanding the concept of mail merge
 Choosing your word processor
 Creating a document template
 Converting existing templates
 Using the Mail Merge Wizard
A
particularly useful ACT! feature enables you to create customized docu-
ment templates. These templates are forms in which ACT! fills in your
selected data fields. You can send these forms to a thousand people as easily
as you can send them to just one person. You can send out routine docu-
ments one at a time on a continual basis, or you can send out the document
one time to all or part of your database. After you create a form, you can
send it out via snail mail, e-mail, fax, or Pony Express.
Mail Merge Isn’t Just about Mailing
Poor mail merge! Folks often have two common misconceptions about mail
merge. Some people think that the term mail merge is synonymous with junk
mail. Also, the word mail makes some folks think that one requirement for a
mail merge is a postage stamp. However, neither of these common miscon-
ceptions is true. A mail merge simply takes the content of one or more fields
and puts that content into a template or form.
A good way to understand the concept of mail merge is to visualize this
simple equation:
template + data field(s) = personalized document

Note the (s) at the end of data field, suggesting that you can use either one
name or many names. Some of you may think that you will never perform a
mail merge because you have no desire to send out a mass mailing. Others of
you may have already perfected the art of mass mailing but never realized
that a mail merge can be directed to one person or to thousands of people. I
hate to be the one to break your bubble, but if you have any kind of routine
documents that you’re generating repetitively, you should be using ACT!’s
mail merge to do it.
The three things necessary to create a mail merge are
 A name or a list of names: By now, you’re the happy owner of a data-
base and know how to create a lookup. (Don’t know how to create a
lookup? Better check out Chapter 7.) You can merge a document with
your current contact, your current lookup, or the entire database.
 A document template: A document template is a letter or form that sub-
stitutes field names in place of names and addresses or whatever other
information that will come directly from your database. ACT! comes with
a number of document templates that you can either use as-is or modify.
You can also create your own document templates by using a word
processor.
 A program that can combine the names into the template: After you
have a list of names and a document template, you need something to
combine them. You could try to use your food processor, but I prefer to
use the mail merge feature in ACT!.
Picking Your Word Processor
ACT! can use either its own word processor or Microsoft Word to create
document templates. By default, ACT! is set to use its own word processor.
Most ACT! users prefer using Word as their word processor, and I assume
that you’re no different. Although the ACT! word processor gets the job done,
chances are you’re already using Word — and using an application that
you’re already familiar with is preferable.
If your word processing preferences inside ACT! aren’t set to use Microsoft
Word as your default word processor, you can’t use existing Word templates
or any templates that you created by using Word. To change your word
processor settings, follow these handy-dandy directions:
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from the Contact Detail window.
2. On the Communication tab, select a word processor from the Word
Processor list.
In this case, you’re choosing Microsoft Word.
3. Click OK.

Using the “out of the box” templates
For those of you all set to write the Great
American Novel, you may want to create all
your own original documents. That’s great, and
I recommend that you skip to the section
“Creating a Document Template.” The rest of
you may be interested in perusing some of the
great templates that come pre-packaged in
ACT!. Even if you decide that these templates
aren’t exactly what you’re looking for, you can
use them as a starting point for developing your
own unique document templates.
The following figure shows you the Open
Template dialog box that appears when you
choose Write➪Other Document from any of the
ACT! windows.
You may want to run each of the templates one
time to determine which ones you think will be
most useful to you. Later in this chapter, you find
out how to modify them to your heart’s content.
Right now, I want to point out a few of my
favorites that you might want to focus on.
These three document templates are listed for
you right up there on ACT!’s Write menu. That’s
because you’ll probably use these three tem-
plates the most often. The letter template is a
great template to use when you need to create
a letter on-the-fly to one of your contacts. It
automatically dates a letter and addresses it to
your current contact. It even includes your
name, company, and title on the bottom. All you
need to do is fill in the body of the letter, and
you’re good to go. Just don’t forget to add the
stamp!
 Letter
 Memo
 Fax Cover Page 
These two templates contain graphics and are
ready to send via e-mail:
 ENewsletter
 Special Offer
The Emailbody template pops up when you
choose Write➪E-Mail Message from any of the
ACT! windows.
You may want to hold off using the Quote 
template — it’s designed for use with the oppor-
tunities you create. Flip to Chapter 20 for more
details.

Converting Existing Document Templates
If you are a user of a previous version of ACT!, you may want to convert your
document templates into the latest and greatest ACT! 2005 format. This is a
fairly easy thing to accomplish.
1. Choose Tools➪Convert ACT! 3.0 – 6.0 Items from any ACT! window.
2. Select the type of document you want to convert.
• ACT! WP Templates: Converts documents that you created with
the .tpl extension
• MS Word Templates: Converts documents with the .adt extension
• E-Mail Templates: Converts documents with the .gmt extension
3. Browse to the folder that contains your “Oldie but Goldie” templates.
ACT!, being the smart program that it is, scrounges around and looks for
a folder that contains document templates (see Figure 13-1).
4. Select the template(s) of your choice and click the right-pointing
arrow.
Go ahead — convert as many templates as you want. There’s no extra
charge!
5. Click Next and then click Finish.

Reaching an Audience of One
Many of you might think creating a mail merge implies sending out a single
message to thousands of people at one time. However, a mail merge can also
be used to automate the most mundane and routine of tasks. You can use
ACT!’s document templates to write a thank-you letter every time that you
land a new client or to write an inquiry letter each time that you receive a
new lead. After you discover this timesaver, I guarantee that you’ll never go
back to your old way of creating documents again!
To send a document to a single member of your database, follow these steps:
1. Create a lookup to find the contact to whom you want to send a letter.
Feel free to turn to Chapter 7 if you need help creating a lookup.
The current contact record that you have displayed is the one whose
information fills in your template.
2. Choose Write and then choose Letter, Memo, Fax Cover Page, or Other
Document.
You can modify any of the ACT! menus. You might want to modify the
Write menu to include some of your own templates. Flip over to Chapter 3
if you need a little refresher course in adding new items to an ACT! menu.
3. Complete the body of the document.
Depending on the type of document that you choose to create and the
modifications that you had previously made to the document template,
you’re looking at the start of a document. For example, by choosing to
create a letter, the name, address, salutation, and closing are already
provided. You just need to add the body of the letter to complete it. If
you chose to create a fax cover sheet, you need merely to add the
number of pages in the transmittal and an optional comment to proceed.
If you choose Other Document, you’re able to choose one of your own
templates. These, of course, already include the body as well.
4. (Optional) Save your document.
After you complete your document, you can save it to the location of
your choice. If you don’t think that it’s necessary to save the document
that you create from your own templates (because you can so easily
recreate them), you aren’t required to.
5. Print, fax, or e-mail your document.
If you are using Word as the default word processor to create your ACT!
documents, you can now print, fax, and e-mail exactly like you’re already
used to doing in Word.
173
Chapter 13: Merging Your Information into a Document

If you chose to print, the Create History dialog box appears after print-
ing is complete (see Figure 13-2). Now this is cool. I like to refer to this as
the “Would you like fries with that?” step. After you create a document
using a document template, ACT!, at your discretion, can create a record
of the document on the History tab. You now have a history of the date
on which you sent a document. Better yet, other people in your organi-
zation are also aware of your interactions with the contact.
• If you do not want to create a history for the document, click the
No, Do Not Record History option.
• If you want to attach the document to a note on the History tab,
select the Attach Document to History check box. When you
enable this option, a shortcut to the document is automatically
added to the History tab; you can access the document by double-
clicking the attachment.
• If you want to have additional information appear in the note that’s
added to the History tab, enter a description of the document in
the Regarding field. This description appears on the History tab
regardless of whether you saved the document.
• Specify whether to print an envelope for the contact. You have to
hand it to ACT!: The program really tries to be as accommodating
as possible. After you work your fingers to the bone creating your
latest tome, ACT! gently asks you whether you want to print an
envelope. If you click No, you’re done with the letter-writing
process.
After you complete the special order for your mail merge, all that’s left
to do is to click the OK button, close your word processor, and return to
ACT!. If you selected Yes to print the envelope, the Print dialog box
appears.

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Creating a Document Template
Before you can win friends and influence prospects with your dazzling dis-
play of personalized documents, you need two basic elements: the data and
the document template.
You’re creating a template, not a document, to perform your mail merge. A
document is a plain old file that you create and use in Word. You use it once,
save it, and store it away for posterity, or delete it as soon as you’re done
with it. A template is a form that merges with your contact information. The
convenience of templates is that you use them over and over again.
Because you already have your data tucked away nicely in your database, all
you have left to do is to create the document template, which involves creat-
ing a form document. Your document template contains placeholders that are
then filled in with information from your database after you perform a merge.
Create a document template by following these steps:
1. Choose Write➪New Letter/E-Mail Template.
If you had previously chosen Word to be your word processor of choice,
try not to look too surprised when Word opens. You’ve already
demanded that ACT! use Word as your default word processor. Like an
obedient contact manager, your wish is ACT!’s command.
2. Resist the urge to close the Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box that’s
obscuring a portion of Word.
The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-3, is the
main event of this little procedure. If you scroll through the Add Mail
Merge Fields list, the various field names should ring a bell. After all —
they’re all of your database fields.
You can drag those pesky fields out of your way by placing your mouse
pointer on the Add Mail Merge Fields title bar and dragging it out of 
the way.
3. Change all your page settings.
Go ahead and change your font, margins, and other formatting items
exactly as if you’re working in a regular ol’ Word document.
4. Create the body of your letter or form.
Nothing new under the sun here. You can backspace, delete, and type
just like you do in a non-template document.
5. Click the spot in your document where you want the field information
to appear.
175
Chapter 13: Merging Your Information into a Document

6. Determine what type of field you want to insert into your template.
The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box allows you to insert three different
types of field information:
• Contact: If you want your contacts’ information to appear when
you perform a mail merge, you need to insert a Contact field into
your template. In a letter, the name at the top that you’re sending
the letter to is the Contact field.
Whatever information you’ve entered into a field appears in the
merged document. If any of the fields in the contact record are
empty, ACT! skips that field; you don’t see a blank line. In Figure 13-3,
I’ve inserted the Company field; if your contact isn’t associated
with a company, that line is skipped.
• Label: Selecting the Field Label option inserts the name of the
field, not the information contained in that field. You may wonder
why you want to go through the effort of scrolling through the list
of field names to insert a label when you could just as easily type
in the field label. I am wondering the same thing!
• My Record: If you want your own contact information to appear,
select the My Record Field option. If you’re creating a letter docu-
ment template, the name on the bottom is your name and is repre-
sented by the My Record field option.
Figure 13-3:
The Add
Mail Merge
Fields dialog
box.
176
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Your My Record information resides on the first contact record that
appears when you log on as yourself in the ACT! database.
7. Insert fields where you want contact information to appear.
Here’s where the fun begins. Every time you get to a part that could be
populated with ACT! information, you must scroll down that long list of
fields, select the one to insert into your template, and click the Add
button.
The field name appears in your document set off by a set of lovely brack-
ets. Treat these field names exactly as you do any other words in your
template. For example, if you want to see them set in bold, bold the field
name. If the contact information appears at the end of a sentence, follow
it by a period.
8. Choose File➪Save As.
Okay, I know that you probably already know how to save a document in
Word, but I want to draw your attention to an interesting phenomenon
that occurs when saving an ACT! document template in Word. Your docu-
ment is automatically saved with the .adt extension. And, unless you
specify otherwise, your template is saved to your default template folder.
In Chapter 3, I show you how to determine the location to save your tem-
plates, and also how to add a document template to the Write menu.
Document templates created with the ACT! word processor end in the
extension .tpl.
9. Check your document for accuracy and edit as necessary.
After you create a template, you can change it whenever the need arises. You
may need to go back and edit an ACT! template for a variety of reasons. After
using it, you may discover a spelling mistake. The contact fields that you’re
using may not be working correctly or may lack the proper punctuation. You
may even want to make changes to the wording in the template. The proce-
dure for editing your document template varies only slightly from that of 
creating the document:
1. Choose Write➪Edit Template.
2. When the Open dialog box appears, select the document template that
you want to open and then click Open.
The template opens in Word, and the Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box
automatically appears (refer to Figure 13-3).
When you’re editing an existing template, you see your field names
rather than your data. If you see actual data, you aren’t editing the tem-
plate, and the changes that you make affect only the current document
that you’re in; your document template remains unchanged.

Checking the spelling in a document template
Life is full of embarrassing moments. For many
of you, the thought of sending a mailing out to
several hundred of your closest friends with
glaring spelling mistakes ranks right up there
with the time you walked into that important
meeting with a piece of toilet paper stuck to the
bottom of your shoe. You’ll want to proofread
your templates carefully. You’ll also want to use
the spell checker to avoid embarrassment.
If you create your template using Word, you’re
on your own here — check your spelling as you
normally do using Word.
To check spelling in the ACT! word processor,
follow these steps:
1. Open the template in the ACT! word
processor.
2. Choose Spelling➪Check Document.
If you really want to be precise, you can first
select a section of your document and then
chose Check Selection.
The Spelling Check dialog box opens and
points out your first boo-boo as illustrated
in the following figure. If your spelling is
anything like mine, this one is the first in a
long list of misspellings!
3. Select one of the following options:
 Ignore: Feel free to ignore the suggestion if
you feel that the word is indeed correct.
 Ignore All: If you use a word several times
throughout your template, you just may
need to click the Ignore All button to avoid
repetitious nagging.
 Add: You probably want to train your spell
checker by adding things like your last
name, city, or company name.
 Change: Like all good word processors,
ACT! treats you to a list of suggestions.
Choose the one you like from the list.
 Change All: If you misspelled a word once,
there’s a good chance that you misspelled
it several times throughout your template.
The Change All button fixes it once and 
for all!
3. Make the appropriate changes to the template.
4. Click Save when you finish editing.

In general, using an existing template is easier than creating a new template
from scratch. Basically, to create a new template, you simply open a similar
template and follow the same procedure as if you’re editing an existing 
template — but save the file with a different name. Or, if the document already
exists in Word, you might want to first open the existing document in Word,
highlight the information that you want to appear in your template, copy it
to the Clipboard, and then paste it into the new template.
Initially, ACT! comes with a default letter, memo, and fax cover page template.
You can access them by choosing Write from any ACT! screen and choosing
letter, memo, or fax. You can easily modify these templates in the same way
you modify any other template: Choose Write➪Edit Template and choose
letter.adt, memo.adt, or fax cover page.adt, respectively. Your person-
alized templates then appear as Letter, Memo, or Fax Cover Page in the ACT!
Write menu.
We’re Off to See the Mail Merge Wizard
When you create a mail merge to multiple contacts, follow these four basic
steps:
1. Select the contacts to whom you’re sending the letter.
2. Select the template that includes both the contact fields that you want
to merge into the letter and the body of the letter itself.
3. Send the output to your word processor, printer, fax machine, or e-mail
program.
4. Perform the mail merge.
Luckily, ACT! has taken the laborious task of mail merging and simplified it.
Throughout the process, you encounter just four easy-to-navigate windows.
Trust me — there’s no chance of losing your way; ACT! holds your hand
during the entire journey.
To perform a mail merge, follow these steps:
1. Select the contacts to be the recipients of your mail merge.
To do so, either use a lookup to select certain contacts (such as all con-
tacts in a specific state, city, or company) or select contacts from the
Contact List.
If you’re creating one of those charming Christmas newsletters telling all
about your two kids who just graduated from Harvard Medical School
and your recent month-long excursion to purchase two Mercedes —
leave me off the list!

2. From any ACT! view, choose Write➪Mail Merge.
3. Decide how you want to send the merge.
Decisions, decisions! The four choices on today’s menu are
• Word Processor saves all the merged documents into a single
word processing document. This choice is good if you want to
review your merged documents before printing them out.
• E-mail sends all the merged documents as e-mail messages.
If you choose to send out a mail merge via e-mail, each recipient
receives an e-mail specifically addressed to that person. No one
sees a list of the other recipients.
• Printer is a good choice if you’re sure that your contact informa-
tion and that your template is perfect, as in error-free. This choice
is also popular if you like to chop down trees in the Amazon. This
option sends all the merged documents directly to the printer.
• Fax sends all the merged documents as fax transmissions. If this
option is grayed out, you don’t have fax software installed on your
computer.
You cannot fax directly from your computer if you don’t have
access to a fax/modem.
4. Pick your template and click Next.
You can now indicate the template to use in your mail merge by clicking
the Browse button and selecting the name of the document template
that you want to use.
The Mail Merge Wizard continues and demands to know, in a loud booming
voice, what contacts. All right, you caught me in one of my Judy Garland
flashbacks. You can’t actually hear the question, but it comes across loud
and clear in Step 4 of the Mail Merge Wizard, shown in Figure 13-4.

5. Choose to whom you want to send the mail merge to and then click
Next:
• Current Lookup merges your document with the contact records
that you chose in Step 1.
• Current Contact sends the merge only to the contact currently
showing in the Contact Detail window.
• All Contacts goes to everyone in your database.
• Selected Group enables you to merge your document with a spe-
cific contact group.
• Selected Company enables you to merge your document with all
the associates of a given company.
Depending on the choice you picked in Step 3, you’re pretty close to the
finish line and you can just click Finish.
• If you chose the printer option, you are hearing the happy sound of
your printer spitting out 1,001 personalized letters to your dearest
friends and relatives.
• If you chose the word processor option, you can now spend the
next two hours reviewing 1,001 personalized letters to your dear-
est friends and relatives, ensuring that all the information therein
is accurate.
• If you chose the fax option, your faxing software opened, and
you’re ready to fax.
6. You have a little more work ahead of you if you chose the e-mail option.
Try not to be discouraged. Your e-mails are going to arrive at their
intended destination long before those people choosing one of the other
options even finishes stuffing envelopes or deciphers the new area code
rules for a fax transmittal. Besides, you’re treated to the options that
you see in Figure 13-5.

• Type the subject line of your e-mail.
• You can create a history of your e-mail by including the subject or
the subject and message of your e-mail on the History tab. You also
have the option of attaching the entire e-mail message to a history,
or simply creating no history at all.
• If you like, you can send an attachment along with your e-mail
blast.
• Specify that each recipient of your e-mail send you back a Return
Receipt.
7. Set your options for the contacts who have missing e-mail addresses.
By now, I hope you are feeling appropriately ashamed by the fact that
you’ve made ACT! work so hard while you simply sat back. ACT! now
patiently asks you one final question regarding your e-mail addresses. As
you can see in Figure 13-6, you have several choices as to how to handle
the MIAs.
8. After you choose all your options, click Finish.
Congratulations! You have now completed in a very short time what used to
take hours and hours of work. Well-done!

Chapter 14
ACT! E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Choosing your e-mail preferences
 Working with your contacts’ e-mail addresses
 Sending e-mail
I
n this chapter, I show you how to integrate ACT! with your existing e-mail
client. ACT! enables you to send e-mail through it to contacts who are in
your database, people who are not in your database, and to a selected group
of contacts in your database. Finally, you discover the various preference set-
tings that are crucial in order to e-mail successfully.
Getting Started with ACT! E-Mail
To fully understand the e-mail portion of ACT!, you must understand the con-
cept of the e-mail client. An e-mail client is an application that runs on a per-
sonal computer or workstation and enables you to send, receive, and organize
e-mail. A senior executive at Best, CRM once told me, “ACT! is not in the busi-
ness of designing e-mail clients.” What that means is that ACT! isn’t built to
replace your existing e-mail client; rather, ACT! works on top of it. It also
means that if you really want to send out a lot of e-mail using ACT!, you proba-
bly want to investigate one of the add-on products I mention in Chapter 25.
As of this writing, ACT! 2005 supports the following e-mail clients:
 Internet Mail (an internal stand-alone e-mail client that supports the use
of your SMTP and POP3 settings)
 Outlook Express
 Eudora
 Outlook

I didn’t include America Online (AOL) in this list because ACT! doesn’t sup-
port it. AOL utilizes its own proprietary e-mail client that does not use the
SMTP and POP3 settings that are common to most other e-mail clients. For
that reason, and for many other limitations of the AOL e-mail client, your
needs are better served by using an alternative method of e-mail for your
business purposes.
The two most commonly used e-mail clients are Outlook and Outlook Express
in the Windows environment. For business purposes, Outlook is probably the
e-mail client of choice. It has more features than Outlook Express and is more
attuned to the business environment. Outlook comes bundled with most ver-
sions of Microsoft Office and is a common fixture on most office computers.
Outlook Express comes as part of the Windows operating system. Because it
is a much more basic program, Outlook Express isn’t as often used for busi-
ness e-mailing.
Setting your e-mail preferences
If you initially set up your database using the Getting Started Wizard (see
Chapter 3, where I show you how to work your way through the wizard), you
already specified your e-mail client. If you’re working on an existing database,
here’s what you must do to configure ACT! for e-mail:
1. Test to make sure that your e-mail is functioning correctly outside of
ACT!.
Before you configure your e-mail preferences in ACT!, I recommend test-
ing your e-mail to make sure that it’s working correctly. Send a test
e-mail to your significant other using Outlook or Outlook Express. Doing
so helps eliminate possibilities if, for some reason, you have trouble
e-mailing in ACT!.
2. Choose Tools➪Preferences➪E-Mail.
The E-mail Preferences dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
3. On the E-Mail tab, click the Composing Options button.
The Composing Options dialog box opens, shown in Figure 14-2, where
you set preferences for your ACT! e-mail.
4. Choose from the following options:
• Send E-Mails In: Lets you select HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) or plain text for the default format type of new messages.
• Default Priority: Allows you to select either a low, normal, or high
priority as the default preference for all your new e-mail.
184
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

• History Options: Allows you to select the history type that is
recorded after you send an e-mail. You can choose to have nothing,
only the subject, the subject and full body, or an attached copy of
your message recorded on the History tab.
• Request Return Receipt: Prompts the recipient of your message to
automatically send a notification when he or she receives your
e-mail.
• Close Original E-Mail on Reply or Forward: Closes the original
message window when replying to or forwarding e-mail.
• Include E-Mail Body on Reply or Forward: Select this option so
that ACT! includes the original message text when you reply to or
forward a message.

Chapter 14: ACT! E-Mail

• Include Attachments on Reply: Select this option so that an
attachment is included when you reply to a message that includes
an attachment.
• Include Attachments on Forward: Same as the preceding bullet,
except that this option applies to messages with attachments that
you forward.
• Use Auto-Fill to Suggest Names By: If you select this option, ACT!
supplies the rest of a recipient’s name after you type the first sev-
eral letters of it.
• E-Mail Addressing and Name Resolution: This determines
whether you want the auto-fill to search through the contact data-
base (ACT!) and/or the e-mail system database (Outlook or
Outlook Express) to find recipient names. You can also indicate
which database you like to have ACT! search through first.
5. Click the Signatures button.
The E-Mail signatures dialog box pops open. Here you type your signa-
ture and any other information that you want to appear in all new e-mail
messages. If you want to include a hyperlink to your Web site, include
the entire URL starting with http://www. For your e-mail address, you
must insert mailto: before the e-mail address, like this:
mailto:karen@techbenders.com.
6. Click OK when you finish.
The signature appears every time that you compose a brand-new e-mail
in ACT! to a new contact or send an e-mail blast (a mass e-mailing that’s
sent to several recipients at once) without using a template.
7. After you set all your Composing Option preferences, click OK.
The E-mail Preferences dialog box reappears.
8. Click the E-mail System Setup button.
The E-mail Setup Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 14-3.
9. Select your preferred e-mail client and then click Next.
• If you select Outlook, you’re asked whether you want to use your
default Outlook settings and to choose from the signatures that
you composed earlier.
• If you select Internet Mail, you have a bit of work to do as seen in
Figure 14-4. You’re prompted to enter the user name, e-mail
address, and SMTP and POP3 assigned to you by your e-mail ser-
vice provider. You might also be asked for your shoe size and
blood type.
10. On the final screen of the E-mail Setup Wizard, click the Finish button.

Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

Editing e-mail addresses
After you set your e-mail preferences in ACT!, you need e-mail addresses so that
you can actually send some e-mails. No doubt that you’ve already added many
e-mail addresses to your ACT! database, but I’m guessing that you haven’t yet
discovered a good way to correct or change existing e-mail addresses.
ACT! is designed to launch the e-mail window when you click the E-Mail field
in the Contact Detail window. This feature allows you to easily send e-mail in
ACT!, but makes editing existing addresses hard.
To edit the E-mail field, try one of these methods:
 Use the Tab key to move the cursor to the E-Mail field. After the cursor
is in an E-Mail field, you can edit it by clicking the E-Mail field’s drop-
down arrow.
Figure 14-4:
Setting up
Internet
Mail.

187
Chapter 14: ACT! E-Mail

 Move the mouse pointer over the E-Mail field and right-click. You can
now edit the E-Mail field.
 Hold the cursor over the E-mail field and wait a few seconds; the cursor
changes from a hand to a vertical line.
E-Mailing Your Contacts
A benefit of sending e-mail from within ACT! is that a history of the event is
added to your contact’s History tab each and every time that you send an
e-mail. E-mail is an increasingly popular form of communication, so having a
history of all the e-mail that you sent to each of your contacts helps you keep
track of it all. You can send e-mail messages to one or more contacts and
attach contact records, group records, or files to your messages.
Depending on how you like to reach your contacts, you can send e-mail to
them using ACT! in a variety of ways. You might be writing a one-time e-mail
to an individual contact, or you might be sending a form e-mail to either an
individual or a whole group of your contacts. You might also want to send a
spur-of-the-moment message to one contact — or even thousands of your
contacts. Explore the possibilities.
E-mailing an individual contact
To send an e-mail to the current contact, follow these steps:
1. Create a new e-mail message with one of three methods.
Although the three methods all result in a new message (see Figure 14-5),
they work in slightly different ways.
• Click in the contact’s E-Mail field: The contact’s name appears in
the To line, and the signature you created appears in the body.
• Choose Write➪E-Mail Message: The contact’s name appears in the
To line, and the wording of the E-mailbody template appears in the
body of the e-mail.
The E-mailbody template works exactly like all other ACT! templates.
For a refresher course in template creation, check out Chapter 13.
• Click the E-Mail icon on the Nav bar and click New: The To line is
blank, and the signature you created appears in the body.
2. In the Subject field, type a subject.
188
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

3. Edit or create the message in the text box.
4. Feel free to pick an option or two from the New Message toolbars,
depending on how fancy you want to get with your e-mail.
When you create an e-mail in ACT!, two toolbars appear in the New
Message window. If you hover your mouse over the various tools, a
ToolTip appears, explaining the function of each button.
• The top toolbar enables you to send attachments along with your
e-mail. You’re probably already familiar with the concept of file
attachments. ACT! also allows you to send either a single contact
record, a group of contact records, or a company to recipients (if
they’re using ACT!).
• The bottom toolbar enables you to make changes to the text for-
matting exactly as you do in any word processor. Notice also two
buttons (refer to Figure 14-5) that allow you to insert either a
graphic or a hyperlink into your e-mail message.
Is the bottom toolbar grayed out? You probably set your e-mail prefer-
ence to plain text. Try switching it over to HTML if you want to add a
splash of color to your e-mails — or at least if you want to be able to use
the formatting toolbar!
5. If you like, change the default options for Priority, Create History, and
Return Receipt.
See Step 4 in the section “Setting your e-mail preferences,” where I
explain these options.
6. Click Send.
Off your mail goes and, depending on the Create History option that you
chose, a message appears on the contact’s History tab.

Chapter 14: ACT! E-Mail

Sending mass e-mails
ACT! makes a distinction between sending e-mail and sending merged e-mail.
Merged e-mails all share the following characteristics:
 When you send a merged e-mail, ACT! relies on a template.
 When you send a merged e-mail, you must include at least one contact
field in your template.
 E-mail merging in ACT! allows each individual contact name to appear in
the To line rather than having to send the mail using the BCC (Blind
Carbon Copy) field.
Important things to consider when sending a mass e-mail
Before jumping head first into the world of mass e-mailing, consider the fol-
lowing important points:
 Test your e-mail preferences. You should test your e-mail preferences
before sending your missive out to thousands of people. If you don’t,
you might find yourself with a thousand e-mails in your outbox that
can’t be sent. Try sending a sample e-mail to a friend or colleague.
 Test your e-mail template. Again, testing your message before sending it
across the universe is always a good idea. Try sending the message to a
co-worker or colleague first. Having correct spelling and punctuation
isn’t a bad idea either.
 Check with your ISP. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have imple-
mented safeguards against spam. Before you send an e-mail to all the
contacts in your database, call your ISP to find out how many e-mails
you can send at a time. If your ISP limits the number of e-mails you can
send at one time, you need to send your mailings in smaller groups or
purchase an add-on product that sends your e-mail in batches. You can
discover more about these products in Chapter 25.
Sending non-merged mass e-mails
If you’re not entirely comfortable with the concepts of e-mail blasting, you
might want to start out by sending an e-mail to your contacts rather than
attempting an actual e-mail merge. This way is great for less computer-
oriented ACT! users to reach a large number of contacts.
You can send non-merged e-mail at the spur of the moment, but it doesn’t
involve the creation of a template. However, you’re not able to customize 
the To or Subject portions of the e-mail with any of your contact’s specific
information.
190
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

To send an e-mail to any number of your contacts, here’s all you have to do:
1. Create a lookup (Chapter 7 shows you how) to find the contacts to
whom you want to send the e-mail.
For example, if you want to send an e-mail to all customers in the
Southeastern Region, create the lookup and then narrow it to include
only those contacts that have an e-mail address.
Narrow your lookup by choosing Lookup➪E-Mail Address; next select
Narrow Lookup for the current lookup and finally click Non-empty
Fields. Voilà! Your lookup is narrowed to include only those contacts
having an e-mail address.
2. Click the E-Mail icon on ACT!’s Nav bar.
The ACT! E-Mail dialog box opens.
If you set your e-mail preferences to either Outlook or Outlook Express,
you now see a mirror image of either your Outlook or Outlook Express
folders.
3. Click the New icon on the e-mail window’s toolbar.
The New icon is easy to spot — it’s the icon that says New on it!
4. Click the To, Cc, or Bcc button.
The Select Recipients dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-6. Here’s
where you choose multiple contacts who all receive your e-mail blast.
Figure 14-6:

Chapter 14: ACT! E-Mail

5. In the Address Book drop-down list, select the address book that you
want to use.
You can select to use either the currently opened ACT! database or your
Outlook e-mail addresses.
6. In the Select From drop-down list, choose All Contacts, Current
Lookup, Groups, or Companies.
• Current Lookup: Limits the list of recipients to contacts in your
current lookup
• Groups: Displays a list of the groups in your current ACT! database
• Companies: Displays a list of the companies in your database
7. Select one or more names from the list on the left.
• To select a single name, click it.
• To select a continuous list of names, click the first name in the list,
press the Shift key, and then click the last name in the list that you
want to select.
• To select multiple (non-continuous) names in the list, click the first
name that you want to select, and then press the Ctrl key while
clicking any and all names that you want to select.
8. Click the To button.
The names that you select appear in the Message Recipients box.
Unless you want all the recipients of the message to know the names of
everyone else who received your e-mail, click the Bcc button rather than
the To or Cc buttons.
9. Click OK.
You return to the New Message window. Notice that the names of all your
intended recipients now appear in the To (or Cc or Bcc) area of your
e-mail message.
10. If you like, change any of the e-mail options.
Go for it! Insert a link to your Web site or attach a file. You find plenty of
options in the New Message menu.
11. Verify that all your intended recipients have a valid e-mail address.
ACT! automatically checks to ensure that an e-mail address exists for
each of your recipients. If you look at Figure 14-5, you’ll notice that some
of the names are underlined; those represent the contacts with valid
e-mail addresses. If a name does not have a valid e-mail address, it is not
underlined. When you send the message, you’re prompted to add any
e-mail addresses that ACT! doesn’t find.
192
Part III: Sharing Your Information with Others 

ACT! isn’t perfect — although it comes pretty darned close! The e-mail
checker finds contacts with blank e-mail addresses as well as those
missing key pieces of information, such as the @ character. If you don’t
know someone’s e-mail address, leaving it blank is better instead of
inserting something cute like N/A that may serve to confuse — or at
least slow down — the checker.
Don’t know whether an e-mail address is correct? You can right-click any
underlined name, and choose Properties to sneak a peek at the e-mail
address you have on record for that contact.
12. Click Send.
You might want to pat yourself on the back, content with the knowledge
that you have mastered the art of sending an e-mail blast.
Sending a templated e-mail
Using ACT! to create an e-mail merge enables you to send personalized tem-
plates for each recipient. The cool thing about ACT! templates is that you can
use them for either mailing or e-mailing. In Chapter 13, I show you how to pro-
duce a mass mailing. The Mail Merge Wizard provides you with the option to
e-mail as well as snail mail. 
But how about if you want to send a thank you e-mail to just one of your con-
tacts? You may not want to go through the entire wizard again, so here’s a few
shortcuts.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Write➪Other Document and chose the
template that you want to use for the body of your e-mail.
2. Generate the e-mail message.
• In the ACT! word processor, choose File➪Send➪E-mail.
• In Word, choose ACT➪Send E-mail. You have the choice of sending
the template as an attachment or as the body of the e-mail. After
you make your selection, select the name of your recipient and
click OK.
Figure 14-7 shows how the message was personalized to include both the
contact’s name and pertinent information.
Mail merge must include at least one mail merge field. If you aren’t personal-
izing your e-mails, you need to choose a different method of e-mailing. Also
keep in mind that you’ll probably want to create a lookup of the contacts you
want to e-mail before starting the e-mail merge!
193
Chapter 14: ACT! E-Mail

Working with Incoming E-Mail
When you’re proficient in sending e-mail, you need to know how to read an
e-mail message. Although you can continue to view your mail using your
existing mail client, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the ACT! e-mail
client. After you open up ACT!’s e-mail by clicking the E-mail icon on the
Navigation bar, you may want to perform one of the following tasks:
 Open a message. Double-clicking the message does the trick.
 Read messages in another folder. Simply click the folder in the Folder
List.
 Sort your e-mail messages. You can change the order by clicking any
column header.
 Create a new contact record from an incoming e-mail (if the contact
isn’t already in your database). Right-click the message and choose
Create Contact From Sender.
This is a particularly timesaving feature of ACT! and ensures that poten-
tial contacts don’t get lost in the shuffle.
 Attach the e-mail to a contact’s History tab. Just like you can create an
automatic history record each time that you send an e-mail to a contact,
you can also create a history each time that you receive an e-mail from a
contact.

1. Choose Actions➪Attach➪Attach to Contact.
2. On the Attach E-mail to Contact dialog box that appears, click the
name of the contact(s) to associate with the e-mail message.
3. Click the To button and then click OK.
ACT! places a note on the contact’s History tab indicating that you
received an e-mail from the contact.
 Schedule a follow-up. Right-click the message and choose Create
Activity from Message.
You can now schedule a follow-up; the subject of the e-mail automati-
cally appears in the Regarding area of your activity.

Chapter 15
Creating Contact Fields
In This Chapter
 Understanding the field concept
 Thinking before adding fields
 Adding a custom field
 Managing the ACT! lists
I
am a firm believer that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Although
adding a field to your ACT! database is not a hard thing to do, it is some-
thing that should be well thought out and planned in advance. This is particu-
larly true if you plan on sharing your database with other users. Planning is
important because you usually have a goal in mind for your database. If your
goal is to create a report with three columns — one for the contact name, one
for the birthday, and one for the Social Security number — you need to make
sure that all those fields exist in your database. Planning also prevents you
from adding thousands of contacts to your database, only to find you have to
modify each record to include information that was omitted the first time
around!
To add a field to your database, you must be a Database Manager or
Administrator; the makers of ACT! made this a requirement so that you
understand the importance of this responsibility. So unless you have adminis-
trative rights to the database, you don’t even have to read this chapter! I sup-
pose you still could, just for curiosity’s sake, but it isn’t necessary.
In this chapter, I show you (all of you who have Administrator or Manager
level rights to your databases anyway) not only how to add new fields to an
ACT! database, but also how to set the various field parameters to help users
use the database more effectively and efficiently.
Before getting started, I want to briefly outline the three steps involved with
adding fields to a database:

1. Understand why you want to add fields and what purpose these fields
will serve.
2. Determine what fields you’re going to add and what drop-down lists will
be available in each.
I can’t stress enough the importance of this step. Plan ahead! Or you
might end up with a big mess. . . .
3. Add the fields.
And, voilà! You’re done. (Okay, this one has a whole bunch of steps, but
you get what I mean.)
Understanding the Concept of Fields
For most of you, adding a field to your database will be easy. After all, you’re
good at following directions. However, for some of you, knowing why to enter
a field can prove to be more challenging.
To explore the question of why, I first want to reiterate the basic concept of
fields. What the heck is a field? A field is a single piece of information. In gen-
eral, a field contains just one piece of information. For example, you have
only one business zip code; therefore, you have one business Zip Code field.
Alternatively, you probably have at least eight phone numbers: home, busi-
ness, toll-free, cellular, fax, beeper, and the list goes on. Each of these phone
numbers requires a separate field.
A good field holds one fairly specific piece of information. A bad field con-
tains too much information. For example, having a separate field for your
street address, city, state, and zip code is a good thing. These separate fields
allow you to perform a lookup based on any of the criteria: You could find
clients by zip code, city, or state. An example of a bad field is lumping all the
address information into a single field; you then lose your ability to perform a
lookup by zip code, city, or state. (Need a refresher on performing lookups?
Head to Chapter 7.)
You might want to consider the following basic rules when determining the
criteria for adding a field to your database:
 A field contains an important tidbit of information.
 A field can be used to perform a query or sort. For example, you may
want to send a mailing to all your customers in New York and sort your
mailing by zip code. To do this sort, you need separate fields for contact
type, state, and zip code.
200
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

 A field can be used to insert information into a report or template. If you
want to create letters thanking one person for buying a purple polka-
dotted vase and another for buying a leopard-print vase, you need a
vase type field.
Do Your Homework!
Okay, I admit it — I’m a former secondary school teacher, and I guess that
background just naturally spills over into my ACT! consulting. Well class, pre-
tend you’re back in school because you’re now going to be assigned some
homework. To be politically correct, I could have said you’re now entering
the pre-planning stage of your ACT! implementation. But I still consider it as
important homework that you must complete prior to jumping in and adding
new fields to your database, so your assignment is as follows:
1. Jot down all the fields that you want to see in your database.
2. Scurry around the office and collect any documents that you want
ACT! to create for you. This includes both forms and form letters.
You’re going to have to get a little high tech here, but I think you can
handle it. Get out your trusty highlighter and highlight any of the infor-
mation in each document that is contact-specific. For example, each con-
tact has its own unique address. Maybe you’re thanking particular
contacts for meeting to discuss purchasing widgets (as opposed to gad-
gets, which you also sell). This means that you need a Product field.
3. Think of how to populate the fields with drop-down lists, and then on
the list that you started in Step 1, jot them down to the side of each of
the fields.
For example, if you run a modeling agency, you might need a field for
hair color. The drop-down choices could contain red, blonde, black, and
punk pink.
4. Sketch out any reports that you want to create from ACT!, and add the
column headings to the now rather-long list that you created in Step 1.
The idea here is to get your thoughts down on paper so that you can
visualize what you want your ACT! report to look like. If you already
have a sample of your report in Excel, you can use that. If not, get out
your trusty pencil and outline what you like your report to actually look
like on a piece of paper.
5. Get out a red pen, and at the top of your paper, write 100%, Well
Done, and draw a smiley face. Hang your list on your refrigerator.
Okay, that last step isn’t really necessary, but now you’re well on your
way to having the database of your dreams!
201
Chapter 15: Creating Contact Fields

Adding a New Field to Your Database
Believe it or not, after completing your homework (see the preceding sec-
tion), you’re done with the hard part of the task. The actual addition of fields
is relatively easy; just follow the steps.
Only an ACT! user with Administrator or Manager privileges can add new
fields to an ACT! database. If the Define Fields option is grayed out in Step 1,
you aren’t logged in as one.
1. In any ACT! view, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
The Contact Detail window is generally a good place to start for most of
your customization projects. The Define Fields dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 15-1. The View Fields For drop-down list indicates that
you’re editing or adding new contact fields to the database. You can also
add new group, company, and opportunity fields to your database by
switching the View Fields For list to the appropriate choice.
ACT! does not allow you to add new fields or edit existing fields while
other users are logged into the database. If you see the warning shown
in Figure 15-2, you know that other users are indeed currently logged
into the database. What to do? Storm over to their workstations in a huff
and demand that they exit out of ACT! immediately. If that doesn’t work,
consider bribery. Conversely, as long as you are editing fields, other
users are not able to access the database. If you look in ACT!’s title bar,
you even notice that “(Locked)” now appears. To avoid frustration on
everyone’s part, you might want to explain this concept to the users of
your database.
Figure 15-1:
The Define
Fields 
dialog box.
202
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. Start by renaming one of the 15 user fields. You find all your fields
listed alphabetically by field name. Select one of them.
This is where you need to drag your homework off the refrigerator and
type in one of the fields that you had planned to create in the Field Name
box. ACT! supplies you with 15 user fields that you can customize to
better serve the needs of your business. After all, Social Security Number
is a lot more meaningful than User 12.
3. Click the Edit Field option in the Field Tasks section.
You’re rewarded with a friendly-looking dialog window that looks exactly
like the one shown in Figure 15-3.
When you run out of user fields to rename, feel free to click the New
Field option in the Field Tasks section.
ACT! rewards you with a blank, new field in the Field Name box and
assigns it the name New Field until you can think of something better to
call it. At that point, the following steps are identical.
Figure 15-3:
Defining an
ACT! field.

203
Chapter 15: Creating Contact Fields

4. Type a field name.
Try not to get too fancy or long-winded when naming your fields. Using
special characters such as <, >, $, or : can cause problems when creating
queries and mail merges, so I recommend that you not use them. You
can use spaces in the field name, but don’t end a field name with a
space. Long field names can be hard to place into mail merge templates
and layouts, so you’re better off keeping field names as short as possible.
5. From the Field Data Type drop-down menu (refer to Figure 15-3),
choose a field type for the field that you’re adding.
You can create a variety of different types of fields. Actually, there are
eighteen different field types but who’s counting? Among the choices are
• Address: Talk about a timesaver! When you designate a field as an
address field, ACT! automatically creates seven fields: three for the
street address, and another four for the city, state, zip, and country.
• Annual Event: Like it or not, some events take place once a year.
Use this field to be reminded of birthdays, anniversaries, and
yearly renewals regardless of the year.
• Character: This is probably the most common of the field type
choices; a character field can contain both numbers and charac-
ters. It’s a one-size-fits-all kind of field.
• Currency: As its name implies, this is for fields relating to cold,
hard cash. The field comes equipped with a dollar sign, appropri-
ate commas, optional decimal places, and a sunroof (optional).
• Date: A really cool thing happens when you make a field a Date
field. When the time comes for you to enter information into a Date
field, you see a tiny little calendar that enables you to select a date.
The calendar is cute, but more importantly, it supplies a useful pur-
pose. If you create a field for a birthday and make it a Character
field, the other local yokels using the database might get creative
and input anything from Jan 1 and January 1st to 01/01 and 1/1.
Finding all birth dates in the month of January would become an
exercise in futility.
• Date/Time: When you really want to be exacting, create a
Date/Time field to record the exact date and time of an event.
• Decimal: This field only accepts numbers, a decimal point, and
more numbers.
• E-mail: It used to be that everyone you know had several phone
numbers. Now, the chances are pretty good that your contacts
have numerous e-mail addresses. Here’s your opportunity to
include as many as you like.
204
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

• Initial-Caps: At first glance, this seems like a nifty option. The idea
behind the Initial Capitals option is that you can turn KAREN
FREDRICKS into Karen Fredricks. Seems like a great idea on paper.
In reality, however, you end up with Ibm Corporation and Marcus
Welby Md.
• Lowercase: i suppose you might want to type in all lowercase. i
just can’t imagine why.
• Memo: This is where you can store a large amount of information
that you don’t want to risk burying away amidst your other notes.
For example, you might want to include your driving directions in
this area.
• Number: This option enables you to enter only numbers into a
field. Say you want to find all your customers that have more than
30 employees. You can easily search for a number greater than 30,
but you can’t possibly search for a number greater than thirty.
• Phone: In Chapter 4, I show you all those nifty things that ACT!
does to speed up the data input process. If you designate a field to
be a Phone field, you automatically get a year’s supply of dashes.
• Picture: A picture is worth 1,000 words, and here’s where you can
stick a picture of each client or a picture of each product that they
bought.
• Time: If time is of the essence, this is where you can input a time.
• Upper Case: I NEVER TYPE IN ALL UPPERCASE BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I’M SCREAMING. BESIDES, I’M AFRAID I MIGHT DEVELOP
POLYPS ON MY FINGER TIPS.
• URL Address: Use this field type if you need to associate another
Web address with your contacts.
ACT! already comes equipped with e-mail and Web site fields for
your viewing pleasure. And, you can add several additional e-mail
addresses to the existing ACT! E-mail field. Add a new URL field
with caution!
• Yes/No: This actually creates a check box field that you can click.
Call me old-fashioned, but I think check box would have been a
more appropriate name. To further confuse the issue, a query on
this field looks for “true” or “false” values.
6. Assign any of the five optional attributes and click Next:
• Allow Editing: Enables any of your users to add new data to a field.
• Allow Blank: If you want to require that a field must be filled in you
need to remove the check mark from this field. Use this option if
you want to require a user to enter information into a certain field.
205
Chapter 15: Creating Contact Fields

• Generate History: This neat little feature generates a history on
the History tab when you change the contents of the field.
• Primary Field: When you duplicate a contact record, the primary
fields are the fields that are duplicated.
• Use Drop-Down List: When you choose this feature, you can either
pick an existing drop-down list or create a new, unique drop-down
list later. I cover creating drop-down lists later in this chapter in
the “Creating a drop-down list field” section.
7. Customize your field further by choosing from the following optional
selections and then click Next.
The next Define Fields screen opens, offering you a few more choices for
your editing pleasure.
• Default Value: If 80 percent of your database consists of cus-
tomers, you might assign Customer as the default value of the
ID/Status field.
• Field Format: If you want dashes to appear automatically in a field,
here’s the place to do it by inserting the # symbol where you want
data to go. For example, a Social Security number looks like ###-##-
####.
• Field Length: You might want to limit the number of characters
that a user can enter into a given field; for example, you can limit a
field looking for values of “yes” or “no” to three characters.
8. Set optional triggers and click Finish.
Adding a trigger to a field causes something magical to happen when
entering data into a field. For example, you might want an Excel spread-
sheet to open when you move your cursor into the field, and an activity
series to start when you leave the field. In Figure 15-4, you see three
ways to start a trigger: when changing a field, when entering a field, and
when leaving a field.
Figure 15-4:
Attaching 
a trigger 
to a field.
206
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

207
Chapter 15: Creating Contact Fields
For each type of trigger you can assign one of three possibilities:
• None: If you want nothing to occur, choose this option.
• Program: Clicking the Browse button allows you to navigate to vir-
tually any file in your computer. You can browse to a program, a
URL, or even to a specific file.
• Activity Series: Clicking the Browse button takes you to a list of
the activity series that you’ve created. If you haven’t created any
activity series, you may want to pay a visit to Chapter 10 to find
out how.
Many of the neat add-on products that complement ACT! are designed as
field triggers; when you purchase the add-on you might need to link the 
product to a specific field. Check my Web site at www.techbenders.com/
act4dummies.htm to find out more about some of these special trigger 
products.
Working with Lists
The sure-fire way to destroy a database is by adding information in an incon-
sistent manner. Drop-down lists help ensure that users input data in a uni-
form manner. As an extra, added bonus, drop-down lists also save you time;
when you type in the first several letters of an item in your drop-down list,
ACT! responds by completing the word for you.
In ACT!, you find three major list types. Two of them, the Product List and the
Process List, are associated with your opportunities. The other list type,
drop-down, is associated with your contact, group, company, and opportu-
nity fields. Although you can add new items to a list as you are using it, man-
aging your lists in one central location is easier.
Creating a drop-down list field
Associating a drop-down list with a field requires two things:
 Specifying that the field is to contain a drop-down list.
 Adding items to the drop-down list.
Although which one comes first doesn’t matter — the field or the drop-down
list — I start by creating a field with a drop-down list:

1. From any ACT! window, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
The Define Fields dialog box opens in all its glory (refer to Figure 15-1).
You might even notice those three items in the List Tasks area. Hold that
thought — I discuss those in the next section.
2. Click the field name that you want to contain a drop-down list and
then click the Edit Field option in the Field Tasks area.
3. Select the Use Drop-Down List check box.
If you want to use an existing drop-down list, here’s your golden oppor-
tunity. For example, the last time I checked, there were 50 US states;
those states are the same for my mailing, business, and home addresses.
You could have one State drop-down list and associate it with the mail-
ing, business, and home state fields.
4. Click Finish.
Whew! That was pretty easy, and if you’re using an existing drop-down list,
you’re finished. However, if you need to build a drop-down list from scratch,
you have more work. Fortunately, ACT! returns you to the Define Fields dialog
box, which is right where you need to be to create or edit a drop-down list.
Creating a drop-down list
This might seem like a case of “which came first, the chicken or the egg?” In
the previous section, I tell you how to associate a field with an already cre-
ated drop-down list. For example, if you create a mailing list address, you can
use the existing State drop-down list to avoid having to type in all the states
into a new drop-down list. In other cases, you need to go back and create the
drop-down list. Here’s what you need to do:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
If you just created the drop-down field, you can skip this step because
you’re already there!
2. Select the Manage Drop-Down Lists from the List Tasks area.
The Create, Edit, or Delete Drop-Down Lists window appears.
• To create a drop-down list: Click Create Drop-Down List from the
Drop-Down List Tasks area.
• To edit a drop-down list: Select the drop-down list and then click
Edit Drop-Down List from the Drop-Down List Tasks area.
The Enter Drop-Down List Name and Type window opens, as shown in
Figure 15-5.
208
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

3. Configure the following drop-down list options and click Next:
• Drop-Down List Name: To make things less complicated for your-
self, use a name that very closely resembles the name of the field
that will be associated with the drop-down list.
• Type: Choose what type of field goes in the list — for example,
character.
• Description: If you have a lot of drop-down lists, you might need to
give your list a bit of further explanation.
• Allow Users to Edit Items in This List: Users have the ability to
edit the drop-down list as they are entering in contact information.
• Automatically Add New Items Users Enter to the List: Lets your
users define the items that will be used in a drop-down list by auto-
matically adding each item they enter into the drop-down list.
If you decide to allow users to automatically add new items to a
drop-down list, you might want to do so only temporarily.
Although this option is a great way to build a drop-down list from
scratch, you run the chance of creating a mess. Make sure that all
users have a good idea of the kind of items that should — and
shouldn’t — be added to the drop-down lists. And, more impor-
tantly, make sure they peruse the existing entries in the drop-down
list before adding new items to avoid duplication.
4. From the Enter Drop-Down List Values window, choose one of the fol-
lowing options:
• Add: When you click the Add button, your cursor jumps down to
the bottom of your list of drop-down items. Type in the new drop-
down item and an optional description, and you’re all set.
• Delete: This permanently removes the selected item from the
drop-down list. However, previously entered information based on
the removed drop-down item still remains in your database.
Figure 15-5:
Configuring
a drop-
down list.
209
Chapter 15: Creating Contact Fields

5. Type in the drop-down list item and an optional description.
Chances are that you don’t need to include descriptions in your drop-
down list. Once in a while, though, they can prove to be priceless. The
State drop-down list consists of the two letter state abbreviations; the
description includes the full name of the state for those of us who can
never remember whether MA stands for Maine, Maryland, or
Massachusetts! You can see what I mean in Figure 15-6.
6. Click Finish when you finish adding all the items you want to your
drop-down list.
Managing the Product List
In Chapter 20, you can find most everything you need to know about the exit-
ing world of Opportunities — and believe me, there are a bunch of cool
things. However, in this chapter, you discover how to modify your fields —
and the drop-down lists associated with them.
Don’t think that because your company doesn’t sell widgets — or some simi-
lar item — that you can’t use the Product List. Perhaps a better name for this
field would have been Products/Services. At any rate, if you are gaining finan-
cially from your customers, use the Product List to help you analyze your
profit centers. 
To modify your Product List, follow these steps:
Figure 15-6:

1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields.
The Define Fields window opens.
2. Click Manage Product List.
The Manage Product List dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15-7.
3. Click the Add button.
A New Product item appears at the bottom of the list of your product
names.
4. Fill in the appropriate fields.
You can move on to the various fields by pressing Tab.
a. Assign a name to your product.
b. Enter an item number if you use them.
c. Add the cost that you pay for the item.
d. Include the price you’re going to charge your customers for the
item.
If your costs and prices fluctuate, feel free to leave those fields blank. You
can always change them each time you enter a new sales opportunity.
5. Click OK to close the Product List and then click Close to close the
Define Fields window.

Managing the Process List
The ACT! program was originally developed as a sales tool for busy sales
people. Today, the product has evolved to the point that just about any
industry and individual can benefit by using ACT!. However, the tradition of
sales tracking remains, and the Process List is just one of those examples.
ACT!’s Process List allows you to set up the steps that everyone in your orga-
nization follows when trying to close a sale. You can even associate a proba-
bility with each step. It is rumored that you need to contact someone 12
times before you convert them from a prospect to a customer; here’s where
you can be reminded of where you are in that process.
To edit or create a Process List, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Define Fields➪Manage Process
List.
The Create, Edit, or Delete Opportunity Processes dialog box, as shown
in Figure 15-8, appears. If you have already set up a Process List, you see
it listed by name, description, and number of stage in the Process List.
2. Select one of the following three options and click Next:
• Create New Opportunity Process: Creates a brand spanking new
Process List.
• Edit Opportunity Process: Allows you to edit an existing Process
List.
• Delete Opportunity Process: Deletes an existing Process List.
Rather than deleting an existing list, you might decide to make it
inactive. You see that option on the next screen.

3. Double-click a name, description, or probability to change it.
If you are editing an existing Process List, modifying an entry by double-
clicking is easy. The steps from the previously created Process List
appear, as shown in Figure 15-9. If you are creating a new Process List,
your processes are empty. Don’t worry though — you can fill them up
easily enough.
4. Click the Add or Delete button to further configure your Process List.
The steps are numbered. ACT! automatically numbers the steps in a
Process List, saving you the effort. If you want, you can change the order
by choosing one of the options to either move an option up or down on
the list. When you move an option, all subsequent steps automatically
renumber.
5. Click Finish when you are done.
In ACT!, you can often skin a cat or solve a problem in more than one way.
You can access the Product and Process lists from two other areas of ACT!:
 From any ACT! screen, choose Contacts➪Opportunities➪Manage
Product (or Process) List.
 Scroll down to the bottom of the Product or Process List when creating a
new, or editing an existing, opportunity. From there, you can select Edit
List.

Customizing Layouts
In This Chapter
 Exploring the benefits of using ACT! layouts
 Moving and deleting fields
 Adding new fields to the layout
 Beautifying your layout
M
any ACT! users are confused about the concept of the layout. In fact,
some of you might have ended up renaming a layout label when you
wanted to rename fields. Remember: A field is a place to store information. 
A layout refers to how you actually see those fields. Your layout determines
both the order of the fields and the format of each field. A layout is the name
for a file that determines which fields you see and in what order those fields
appear. After you add new fields to your ACT! database, the next step is to
stick them into an existing layout (or design a new one).
The layout confusion is further compounded by users who share their data-
base across a network. Problems occur if the users are accessing different
layouts. Depending on the layout that they are using, some users may not be
able to see all the fields of the database.
In this chapter, I show you how to use the Layout Designer to modify an exist-
ing layout. Here you master adding or replacing tabs on your layout, reorder-
ing all the fields when you finish, and finally, adding a few artistic touches to
your masterpiece.
Only database users with the Administrator or Manager level of security have
access to the Layout Designer. If you are a Standard, Restricted, or Browse level
user you get to sit back, put your feet on the desk, and direct the Administrator
or Manager as to how you want to have the layout designed. Be careful what
you wish for, however; if you are an Administrator or Manager, you get to do all
the dirty work, so keep reading!

Modifying an Existing ACT! Layout
Before you begin modifying an existing layout, think about how you want
your fields arranged on your layout. Why not try out all the layouts that
come with ACT!? This way, you get a feeling for the one that’s most comfort-
able to you. Don’t worry about colors or the names on the tabs — you can
change all that.
Designing a new layout completely from scratch is possible, although 
more trouble, than modifying an existing one. If you feel the urge to design a 
new layout from scratch, you need to know that you’ll start with an entirely 
blank canvas. If you like to have a go at it, choose File➪New from the Layout
Designer, and a brand-new — absolutely blank — layout appears. You have 
a lot of work ahead of you. And I’m guessing a lot of headaches, too. So why
bother with creating a new layout from scratch? I can’t think of a good reason.
I recommend just making changes to an existing layout — you save yourself a
lot of time and grief and will probably be very happy with the results.
When you save a contact layout, ACT! automatically assigns it the extension
.cly. When you save a group layout, ACT! gives it the .gly extension. And
when you create a company layout, the file is given the .aly moniker.
Arranging fields the way you want them
Ah, the age-old question of form versus function. This hint may sound like a
no-brainer, but many ACT! users never realize the importance of changing the
field locations in their layout. For example, you might choose a layout that
has the main business phone number on the top portion of your layout, the
home phone number on a different tab along the bottom, and the mobile
phone number in a third location. If you’re constantly flipping between tabs
to find phone numbers, move them together into one strategic place on your
layout. This organization might not make your layout look better, but you’ll
certainly feel better! The point is to design your layout in such a way that
data input becomes easy — and possibly even fun!
Here’s what you do to modify an existing layout:
1. Choose the layout that’s closest to the one that you want to have.
If you need help with switching layouts, take a peek at Chapter 2.
2. Choose Tools➪Design Layout➪Contact.
You’ll notice that you’re also given a choice of group and company.
That’s because you can also design — or redesign — your group and
company layouts in exactly the same way as you do for your contact
layout.
216
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

The Layout Designer opens. Each field consists of two elements (see
Figure 16-1):
• The field label is an optional element but usually appears immedi-
ately to the left of a field.
• The field itself is identified by the down arrow that appears at the
field’s right edge.
3. Maximize the Layout Designer.
Okay, this step isn’t a necessity, but it sure makes your design chores a
whole lot easier! I’m always amazed when I see someone struggling with
layout on a small portion of the monitor.
4. Make sure the toolbox and Properties window are both open.
These are two important windows that you need to have open in order to
create or modify a layout. The toolbox sits on the left side of the Layout
Designer, and the Properties window sits on the right side. Feel free to
move them out of your way if you like, but trust me — you’re going to
need them momentarily!
If the toolbox and/or the Properties window are nowhere to be seen, try
giving the View menu a click to open them. You see both of them listed
right there; a check mark next to either Toolbox or Properties Window
means they are alive and well — and living on the Layout Designer.

5. Choose File➪Save As and give your layout a new name.
I recommend renaming your layout so that you can later go back to your
original layout (if you totally annihilate this one) and easily identify your
layout (if you choose a recognizable name).
The name of your layout appears in the Layout Designer title bar (refer
to Figure 16-1).
As you make changes to your layout, the Save icon on the Layout
Designer toolbar comes to life. Click it to save your work. Relying on the
old undo standby (Edit➪Undo) is an option, but saving your layout early
and often is always a good idea!
6. Select the Pointer tool in the toolbox.
The Pointer tool, the tool that you’ll probably use most often, enables
you to select fields so that you can move, change, or remove them.
7. With the Pointer tool, select the fields and field labels that you want
to move — or remove — from the layout.
Removing unused fields can simplify a layout and make room for other
fields that you want to add. I recommend removing what’s unwanted
before moving on to other aspects of the layout design process.
Make your selections by any of these methods:
• Click any field or field label to select it.
• Click any field and then press Shift or Ctrl while clicking additional
fields to select multiple fields and labels.
• Create a box around the desired labels and fields by holding down
the left mouse button and then dragging to create a selection box.
When you select a field, a border of small boxes appears around the field
indicating that it is selected. In Figure 16-1, the Address field is selected.
8. Press the Delete key.
The unwanted fields go away.
In Chapter 15, you find out how to create and edit fields. One of the field
options is the ability to allow users to edit the contents of a field. If you
remove that option, users can view the contents of a field, but they can’t
change it.
Removing a field from the layout does not remove the actual field from
the database. The field remains in your database but isn’t visible in the
layout. See the “Using layouts to restrict access to key fields” sidebar for
more details.
218

9. To move fields around, select them with the Pointer and then drag
them to a new location on your layout.
If only rearranging the living room is this easy! The idea is to drag the
selected fields and their corresponding labels to the place on your
layout that seems the most logical to you. When you hold your mouse
over selected fields, your cursor transforms into a plus sign, indicating
that you’re ready to move the field.
If you only need to make a minor adjustment to the field location, you
might try using your keyboard’s arrow keys for really fine-tuning your
layout.
You can cut a group of fields by selecting them and then pressing Ctrl+X.
Move your cursor to the new spot on your layout where you want to place
the cells and press Ctrl+V. Voilà — you’ve moved the group of fields en masse.
Adding new fields to the layout
In Chapter 15, you find out how to modify existing fields or to create new
ones from scratch. When you rename an existing field in ACT! that is already
present on your layout, the new name is magically reflected on the layout.
Typically, you start by renaming the 15 user fields; after you do, your work is
over because that new name is now included in your layout.
Adding a new field to your ACT! database is a bit more complicated because
after you create the new field (see Chapter 15), you now need to find a place
for it on your layout. But, if you follow the upcoming steps, you’ll find that
adding the new field to your layout is certainly not an insurmountable task:
1. Click the Field button in the Layout Designer’s toolbox and then hold
down the left mouse button and drag the cursor to the right to define
the field’s size and position on your layout.
The Select Field dialog box opens, presenting a list of all the fields that
do not currently appear on your existing layout. The fields are listed
alphabetically. If you added an address block, all the related fields
appear together, which allows you to easily add them all to your layout
in one fell swoop. You’ll notice in Figure 16-2, for example, that all the
credit card address fields are lined up together.
Clicking the Field button allows you to add the vast majority of new
fields that you’ve added to your database. However, you’ll notice a few
other field types lurking in the field section of the toolbox. These include
• Memo
• Picture
• YesNo
219
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

The Memo and Picture fields are super-sized fields that need to be made
larger than your other fields. The YesNo fields are tiny little ones that
are only large enough to hold a check mark. Don’t worry if you’re having
trouble “guesstimating” the size of those fields; ACT! automatically
resizes them for you.
Even though the field is called a YesNo field, it is actually a check box
field that you click to indicate yes or no.
2. Select the field that you want to add to the layout, deselect the Include
a Label check box (if you don’t want the field to have a label), and
then click the Add button.
The field is added to your layout. You can add as many fields to your
layout as you like, but you’re allowed to use each field only once.
3. When you’re done adding fields, click the Close button in the Select
Field dialog box.

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
Using layouts to restrict access to key fields
If you have certain fields in your database that
you don’t want other database users to have
access to — for example, a record of your cus-
tomers’ credit card information — you can’t
restrict your users from viewing selected fields
because ACT! doesn’t have field-level security.
You can create specific layouts, however, that
don’t include the fields that you’re concerned
about.
What you do is create a custom layout based on
your current one, remove the fields that you
don’t want other users accessing, and then dis-
tribute the new layout to your staff. As long as
your users don’t have access to other layouts
that include these fields, these fields remain
invisible to them.
Although this method of securing your database
isn’t foolproof, creative use of your layouts can
help you add more security to your database.

Changing the tabs
Just like you can add, move, or remove the individual fields of your database
on your layout, you can also add, move, or remove the tabs that are on your
layout. Using tabs is a great way to organize the fields in your database. You
might have a Products tab that, ironically, lists the various products that you
are tracking. You may even have a Personal tab that includes all the personal
information about a contact: their birthday, anniversary, blood type, IQ, and
shoe size. The whole point of being able to customize your layout is to make
it comfortable for you. If you find yourself constantly hunting for a field,
chances are that your fields are not arranged in a logical fashion. If that’s the
case, consider editing the tabs on your layout:
1. From the Layout Designer, choose Edit➪Tabs.
The Edit Tabs dialog box appears (see Figure 16-3), where ACT! gives
you several tab customization options.
2. Hide any tabs you no longer want to display in your layout.
You’ll notice the single left- and right-pointing arrows in the Edit Tabs
dialog box. These arrows allow you to hide a tab. Although the system
tabs — Notes, History, Activities, Groups, Opportunities, and Docu-
ments — can’t be deleted, you can hide them by moving them into 
the Hidden Tabs area on the left side of the Edit Tabs dialog box.
Hiding a tab on a layout is a great way to hide certain key pieces of infor-
mation from the lesser beings around your office. You might prefer that
the temporary help doesn’t have access to the credit card information 
of your customers or that your staff doesn’t have access to employment
information that you might be storing on your database. Then, when no
one’s looking, you can always unhide the tab to access that top-secret
information.
Figure 16-3:
Editing tabs
in an ACT!
layout.
221
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

Unless you want to drive yourself nuts, you might want to be very care-
ful about hiding tabs. You can place a field only on one layout. Be careful
that you don’t place a field on a tab and then hide the entire tab or you
might drive yourself nuts looking for the field that appears to be MIA.
3. Customize your tab according to your own sense of design and order.
• Add Tab: Add an additional tab to your layout. Enter a name for the
new tab in the Add Tab Layout dialog box and then click OK. You
now need to go back and add some fields to that shiny new tab.
• Edit Tab: Give the tab a new name.
• Delete Tab: Remove a tab from your layout.
When you remove a tab from a layout, all the fields located on that
tab are removed as well. Consider moving — or removing — all the
fields from a tab before you delete the tab itself!
• Move Up: Move a tab so that it appears before another tab.
• Move Down: Arrange a particular tab so that it appears after
another.
4. Click OK when you’re happy with the name and order of your tabs.
Changing the order of things
You can — and should — use the Tab key to progress through your fields as
you input contact information into your database. When you start with an
ACT! layout “right out of the box,” you can tab through the fields in a logical
order — that is, from top to bottom. However, you may prefer to move hori-
zontally across the layout rather than vertically from top to bottom. Or, you
might find that after adding a few fields you can no longer tab through your
fields with the greatest of ease. Modifying layouts generally renders the field
entry order non-sequential.
Although having out-of-sequence field ordering doesn’t damage your data-
base, it does make inputting data difficult. Each time that you press the Tab
key, your cursor skips to the next numbered field instead of to the next field
that you see on your layout. This could be a real bummer if not for the fact that
you can reorder your fields when necessary. A tab stop is associated with every
field on your layout; the Tab Stop number determines the order of the fields.
Although an important step, you might want to hold off on changing the field
order until you are absolutely, positively, 100 percent certain that you are
happy with the way you’ve placed the fields on your layout. There is no 
222
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

magic way to simply number the fields consecutively from one to one hun-
dred; unless you want to waste a lot of your time by redoing your work, you
might save this step until after you live with your layout for a while.
1. Choose View➪Tab Stops➪Show Tab Stops in ACT!’s Layout Designer.
The tab stop appear in the Layout Designer, as shown in Figure 16-4.
When you enter the land of Tab Stops, you’ll probably notice two things:
Little red numbers now appear to the right of each field, and you no
longer have the toolbox and Properties window to play with.
When you add a new field to your layout, ACT! automatically assigns the
field the next available field number. When changing the field number
order, focus on those fields because that’s where the numbering is out of
whack. If you previously removed a field number and not assigned it to
another field, ACT! automatically assigns that number to the next field
that you add to your layout.
2. Select any fields for which you want to change the field order.
If you select the fields whose field entry order you want to change (refer
to Figure 16-4, where the fields are not numbered sequentially), the
number disappears.
3. Select the fields a second time to reassign the field the next available
number.
When you select the field again, the next available number is assigned to
the field. Feel free to select the fields in any order you want. After all,
this is your layout!
Figure 16-4:

the order of
the tab
stops.
223
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

4. Right-click a field, choose Set Index, and type in a field number to
“advance” several fields at a time.
This is a great party trick in the event that you need to squeeze a field or
two in among all your existing fields and don’t want to have to “click”
and “re-click” each and every field in your layout. Say, for example, that
your fields are numbered sequentially from 1 to 61, and you want to stick
a new field smack under field 1. Whew! You’re looking at a lot of click time.
But wait! If you right-click field 2, choose Set Index, and change the field
number to 3, you see all the fields from 2–61 magically increase by one
digit.
I wish I had a great tip for decreasing the field numbers in the event that
you remove a field. Unfortunately, I don’t. And, I wish I could undo the
field numbers if I increased them by accident. I can’t. All I can tell you 
is to be careful when setting the field index because it can’t easily be
reversed.
5. Choose View➪Tab Stops➪Show Tab Stops to leave the tab stop area.
6. Click View➪Enter Stops➪Show Enter Stops to begin editing the enter
stops.
Just like the tab stops control the order that your cursor follows as you
tab through your layout, the enter stop controls the path your cursor
takes as you press Enter. Think of the enter stop as a bypass, allowing
you to skip merrily from one area of your layout to the next.
The enter stop looks and feels pretty much like the tab stop with two
major differences: The Enter Stop dialog box is tastefully decorated in
green instead of red, and you use a whole lot fewer of them. In general,
you want to place an enter stop at the beginning of each group of fields.
You may want to have one at the beginning of the address, one at the
start of the phone numbers, and a third one conveniently located on the
first of the personal fields.
7. Choose View➪Enter Stops➪Show Enter Stops to return to the Layout
Designer.
Beautifying Your Layout
I’ll admit that I count myself among the artistically challenged of this world. If
you read and assimilated everything in the beginning of this chapter, you’re
now pretty much equipped to go forth and design a nifty new layout. But
before tackling that new design project, you might first want to give some
thought to some of the things that can make your layout a bit more artisti-
cally pleasing.
224
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Doing minor touch-up work
At this juncture, you have left the area of function behind you and have moved
on to some of the more aesthetically pleasing aspects of layout design. You
can also decide whether your layout needs a major or minor makeover. The
Edit Properties dialog box allows you to make changes to the font, font size,
and other attributes, and to the basic border style. This is great for simple
touch-up work but is rather limiting if your layout needs an extreme makeover.
You can change the font and border attributes in the Edit Properties dialog
box (see Figure 16-5). Right-click the label or field you want to change and
choose Edit Properties.
Creating an extreme makeover
Use the Properties window if you want to create some major changes. 
There are two great advantages of using the Properties window over the 
Edit Properties dialog box. First, you can edit more than one field at a time.
Secondly, you have a whole lot more choice about which elements you can
edit.
If you click around in the Layout Designer, the choices in the Properties
window change accordingly. If you click in a field, you can change the various
color and font attributes; if you click in a label, you can edit the text of the
label.
Figure 16-5:

dialog box.
225
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

If you’re having trouble reading the various options on the Properties
window, you may want to resize it so that you can read it better. Simply place
your cursor over the left edge of the window; when your cursor changes to a
double pointing horizontal line, drag to the left to expand the window.
Changing a field label
In most cases, the field name and the field label are exactly the same. Having
a field label differ too radically from the name of the actual field proves to be
quite confusing when you wander into the area of template and report cre-
ation. However, sometimes you might want to tweak the field label so that it
fits on your layout better. For example, the Cellular Telephone Number field
might be represented by the Cell label.
You can change a field label with two different methods:
 Double-click the label.
The label turns into a text box with a blinking cursor. Delete any unnec-
essary letters and type the new label.
 Type the new field label in the Text section of the Properties window.
Adding color to your drab life
ACT! comes with close to a zillion colors that you can add to your layouts.
Okay, you caught me; there might be a few less than a zillion, but I think just
about every color of the rainbow is represented. To use one of those nifty
colors, follow these steps:
1. Click in the background of your layout in the Layout Designer.
2. Select a background color from the Properties window.
You can now change the background color by clicking the Background
Color drop-down arrow and selecting a color that matches your mood —
or the décor of your office. Like magic, your background color changes.
If it doesn’t, it’s probably because a graphic is hiding that beautiful back-
ground color. If that’s the case, go on to the next section.
You’ll notice that the background colors are further divided into three tabs:
Custom, Web, and System. By default, you’re on the Web tab; that’s where
you find the largest selection of colors to work with. The System tab is for the
drab members of the audience who prefer to work in the more refined shades
of gray.
Some of you may be a little hard to please and find that the colors provided
in ACT! just don’t match the décor of your home or office. If you want to add
your own custom-blended color to your layout, you can easily do so by
226
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

mixing your very own custom color on the Custom Color tab. When you
create a custom color, the Properties window displays the RGB (red, green,
and blue) number associated with the custom color. Feel free to change those
numbers if you’ve worked with graphic programs in the past and want to
match your layout to a specific color.
Changing the colors of your fields and labels is just as easy. Just select the
fields or labels and change the color option in the Properties window exactly
like you do for the layout background.
You can select as many fields and/or labels if you like and then change the
color for your entire selection at the same time.
Got a few fields that you want to make sure are used by your users whenever
possible? Make a field mandatory by turning off the Allow Blank option in the
Define Fields dialog box. This option can be an annoying one if you just don’t
have the information needed to fill in the field at the time of your data input;
ACT! demands that you supply the missing information before you leave the
record. An alternative might be to highlight the critically important fields in a
stunning shade of yellow so that users recognize their importance without be
asked to supply information that they might not have.
Adding the Finishing Touches
Whew! After you add, delete, move, and color your fields, you’re ready to
sally forth into the world and start using your new layout. But wait! If you
look carefully at your layout, things might look a bit, well, cock-eyed. That’s
an official computer term to indicate that your fields seem out of whack
because they consist of various sizes and aren’t aligned properly. If I didn’t
like you so well, I’d tell you to grab your mouse and start adjusting those
whacko fields by dragging them into submission. Several hours later, after
much dragging, resizing, and probably quite a bit of cursing, you’d probably
end up in pretty much the same place as you started. But because the point
of this whole book is to show you how to do things the easy way, you might
want to read the following sections instead.
Lining up fields and labels
One way to give your layout a truly polished look is by aligning all fields and
labels. When you move a field to a new location on your layout, you have a
strong possibility that the field is slightly out of line, both vertically and hori-
zontally, with the other fields. Of course you can always try to “eyeball it” by
227
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

dragging the field around trying to get it into just the perfect spot. This
method can be very time-consuming, aggravating, and hard on your carpal
tunnel. I have a much easier — and precise — way to accomplish your goal:
1. Select the errant field that is out of alignment.
2. Click the anchor field (the field that is properly aligned).
If you look closely, the selection boxes around the errant field are white,
and the selection boxes around the anchor field are black. This is your
indication that the anchor field stays in place and the other field lines up
with it.
You can align several fields at a time by selecting them and right-clicking
the anchor field. The field you right-clicked now becomes the anchor,
and all the other selected fields line up with it.
3. Right-click any of the selected fields and choose an alignment option.
As you can see in Figure 16-6, you’re given a whole bunch of options
from which to choose. Here are the two you’ll probably use the most
often:
• Align Lefts: Typically your fields look the best if they are lined up
along the left edges looking vertically down the layout. To do this,
you want to select your fields from top to bottom before aligning.
• Align Tops: If you have two or three columns in your layout, you
want your fields to align along the top edges as well. Select your
fields horizontally, from left to right, before choosing this option.
If you choose the incorrect alignment option you might end up with a
mess in which all your fields are now on top of one another. Quick!
Reach for the Undo button. Don’t see it? Choose Edit➪Undo.
4. Click anywhere in your layout to remove the selection boxes.

228
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Resizing fields
You’ll probably find yourself in a number of situations in which you need to
resize one or more fields. Typically, you want to make several fields smaller
so that you can squeeze more fields into your layout. You might want to make
several fields larger so that you can add more data into those fields. Or, you
might find that a new field you just placed on your layout isn’t the same exact
size as the other fields. Again, you can manually resize your fields one at a
time. You can also knock your head firmly against the wall several times, but I
don’t recommend either activity.
 To resize several fields at a time: Select all the fields that you want to
resize en masse. Then place your cursor on one of the selection boxes
on either the left or right edge of the selected fields. When your cursor
turns into a single horizontal arrow, drag the selection box to the left or
right, depending on whether you are making the fields larger or smaller.
 To resize against the anchor: Select all the fields that you want to be the
same exact size as an anchor field. Press the Ctrl key, click the anchor
field once, pause, and then click it a second time so that the selection
boxes are now black. Choose Format➪Make Same Size➪Width.
Adding a logo or a graphic
Perhaps the best way to truly personalize your layout is by adding your very
own logo to it. Adding a graphic to the layout means that the graphic appears
on each and every one of your contact records. Don’t confuse this with a
Picture field; a Picture field varies for every one of your contacts. You can
add your chef-d’oeuvre to your layout by following these easy steps:
1. From the Layout Designer, click the Drawing button in the toolbox
and then choose the Image tool.
2. Using your mouse, draw a shape on your layout to match the graphic
you want to insert.
The Open dialog box opens.
3. Navigate to the graphic you want to insert, select it, and click Open.
The graphic now appears on your layout. You can drag the graphic to a
new, improved location by placing your cursor on the graphic. When
your cursor turns into a plus sign, drag the graphic to the appropriate
spot on your layout.
229
Chapter 16: Customizing Layouts

Creating a circle in a square
Admittedly, no one would ever confuse me with Picasso. However, some of
you might be of a more artistic persuasion, or just want to take advantage of
some of the drawing tools to add a little clarity to your layout. By creating a
square that is slightly larger than a grouping of several of your fields, you are
in essence creating a frame that serves to highlight those fields.
If you click the Drawing button in the toolbox, you’ll notice the Rectangle and
Ellipse options; these are just fancy words for square and circle. At any rate,
by clicking either of these options, you can draw a square or circle (okay, a
rectangle or an ellipsis) on your layout. After they’re drawn, you can head
over to the Properties window and change the color of your newly created
shape. This is a great way to emphasize a group of fields, particularly if your
layout is starting to look cluttered.
Did your newly created circle or square plunk itself down on top of your
existing fields? Although this leads to an interesting work of art, you probably
prefer to have the graphic behind the fields. Don’t panic; simply right-click
the graphic in question and choose Send to Back.
Adding text boxes
If a picture is worth a thousand words, a text box might just be worth a mil-
lion. Inconsistent data input is a sure-fire way to decrease the productivity of
your database. This lack of uniformity is often caused not by lack of knowl-
edge but rather by lack of communication. Adding a text box to your layout is
a great way to help users input key pieces of information in the right place
and to help organize the groups of data on the layout. Use your text boxes to
create a heading for a group of fields or to include data input instructions to
your users.
1. From the toolbox, click the Drawing button and then choose the Text
tool.
Your cursor now looks like a plus sign instead of the normal arrow.
2. Find the spot on the layout to add a text box, hold down your left
mouse button, and drag the cursor to create a box.
3. Use the Properties window to customize your text box.
Here’s where you can really have fun. As long as the new text box is
selected, you can change the text, font attributes, font color, and back-
ground color of the text box.
230
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

I’m a firm believer in doing things the easy way whenever possible. If you find
yourself longing to have several text boxes all formatted the same way, create
the first text box, customize it just the way you like it, and then clone it by
right-clicking it and choosing Copy. At that point, you can paste it on your
layout — and the only thing you have to change is the text.
Building a table
Some of you may find yourselves running out of room on your layouts because
you needed to add so many customized fields. As an alternative to the tradi-
tional concept of listing all your field labels next to your actual fields, you
might consider arranging your fields in table format, as shown in Figure 16-7.
The idea here is to save room and allow you to easily fill in vital information.
Consider building a table if you have several products and need to track the
purchase date, serial number, and expiration date for each one. Or maybe
you’re a realtor and want to list the dimensions of several rooms. Not all
databases can take advantage of a table format but those that can free up a
lot of space on their layout.

Maintenance
In This Chapter
 Performing routine maintenance
 Avoiding database corruption
 Backing up the database
 Restoring the database
 Editing and replacing field data
I
n this chapter, I show you how to take care of your motorcycle . . . er, 
I mean your database. Would you believe that your ACT! database is 
very similar to a motorcycle? Both are made up of many moving parts that
require maintenance. Failure to provide routine maintenance can result in big
problems — for a motorcycle as well as for your database. If something does
go wrong, having a backup is nice and, in most cases, necessary to keeping
your job. Sometimes your motorcycle gets dirty; likewise, your database is
prone to clutter. You’ll sometimes have to bite the bullet, roll up your sleeves,
and do a little cleaning — and clear out old or duplicate contact records 
from ACT!.
Regular maintenance keeps your database running efficiently. When you
don’t provide routine maintenance for a motorcycle, things get corroded;
when you don’t provide maintenance for your database, your records
become corrupted. Quite simply, a corrupted database is one in which weird
things start happening. No, you won’t see a ghost, but you might not see a
note that you know you created the day before. Or that note just might pop
up again later — in the wrong place!

Understanding the Need
to Check and Repair
I love to change the messages on my voice mail, and one of my favorite
choices is, “Have you checked and repaired your database today?” Users
often offer up a variety of excuses for why they didn’t perform routine data-
base maintenance. These excuses range anywhere from “I didn’t have time”
to “I didn’t know I was supposed to.” Of course, many of you give these
excuses after your database has already been damaged. By then, of course, it
may be too late for checking and repairing.
Determining the maintenance frequency
If you are a little old lady who uses your database only once in a blue moon,
you may get away without maintaining your database. However, if the data in
ACT! is extremely important to you, you want to perform your maintenance
on a routine basis. At a minimum, I recommend your database receive a bit of
tender loving care at least once a week.
My general rule is that the frequency of maintenance is directly tied to the
amount of use that your database is receiving. There is no such thing as
doing too much maintenance — only too little! Here are some situations that
warrant more than weekly maintenance:
 You have a multi-user database.
When ACT! is being used over a network the database is subject to more
use — and abuse. The chances of having inaccurate and incorrect infor-
mation increase exponentially with the number of users entering data
into the database.
 You have a large database.
 You add new fields to your database.
 You make changes to the drop-down lists in your database.
 You add or delete numerous contact records to your database.
 You import another database into your existing ACT! database.
 You add — or delete — users to your database.
 You experienced a power outage.
 You had network problems.
 You suspect that your database is corrupted.
 You had a really lousy day when everything seemed to go wrong.

What are the warning signs of a corrupted database? Database corruption
comes in many shapes and sizes. The following is a list of some of the more
common indications of a corrupted ACT! database:
 While trying to open a database, you receive an error message or ACT!
stops responding. Smoke might be seen rising from the back of your CPU.
 You receive error messages while working in ACT!.
 You can’t log into the database as a particular user.
 Information appears to be missing, or mysteriously appears attached to
the incorrect contact record.
 You notice a significant increase or decrease in the number of contact
records in your database.
 Your database is acting funny or running slower than usual.
If you notice one — or heaven forbid, more than one — of the preceding
warning signs, I’m sorry to say that the time has come to either perform CPR
on your fainthearted co-workers or perform some simple database mainte-
nance. In the next section, I give you the details on performing the simple
database maintenance (that is, checking and repairing). You’re on your own
with the CPR.
Sometimes determining whether the corruption is in the database or in the
ACT! program itself is difficult. To determine this, try opening the Act7demo
database that’s installed on your computer when you installed ACT!. If the
Act7demo opens and runs correctly, the problem lies with your database. If
you encounter the same problems in the Act7demo database that you’re
having in your own database, you might need to reinstall ACT!.
Performing Routine Maintenance
The old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” does not apply to ACT!. Proper
maintenance enables your database to run efficiently and improves perfor-
mance. Some of the maintenance takes on a rather “behind the scenes”
approach; users don’t detect that maintenance has been performed. They
know, however, that the maintenance hasn’t been done if they start running
into problems with the database. The other type of maintenance involves
actual data cleanup; astute users can detect that changes have been made to
the database.
235
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

Only the database Administrator can perform routine maintenance to ensure
that your database continues to chug away without any problems. That’s
probably to ensure that everyone knows who to point at if things go wrong.
Some maintenance tasks require that all users log off of the database so that
the database can be locked, but those can be scheduled for off-peak or even
overnight hours.
In ACT!, basic maintenance is referred to as checking and repairing. The
system Administrator can run the Check and Repair tool regularly to ensure a
healthy database, which consists of two procedures: the Integrity Check and
the Re-index. These procedures are very similar to the Scan Disk and Disk
Defragmenter procedures that you might already perform on your PC. The
Integrity Check scours the database for errors and repairs them if found.
After any found errors are repaired, Re-index squeezes out all the little empty
spaces that are left in your database when you delete contact records in
order to ensure maximum performance.
Yikes! Performing the Check and Repair sounds really important so you’re
probably thinking that it must be really hard. Wrong! Here’s all you need to do:
1. Log in as an Administrator and make sure that all other users are
logged off the database.
If the Check and Repair command is grayed out from ACT!’s Tools menu,
you don’t have sufficient administrative rights to perform that option.
You might want to jog your database Administrator’s memory a bit to
remind him that his salary is directly proportional to the efficient perfor-
mance of your database!
2. Choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Check and Repair.
The Check and Repair Database window opens, as shown in Figure 17-1.
3. Select both the Integrity Check and Re-index options and then click OK.
Your computer makes a few whirring noises, and a snazzy indicator bar
appears momentarily on-screen. Try to look important during this time
so as to justify your administrative salary.

Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

Backing Up the ACT! Database
You probably already know the three rules of real estate: location, location,
location. Similarly, the three basic rules of computing are backup, backup,
backup! With the proliferation of viruses, as well as the poor construction of
many computers, backing up on a daily basis is imperative. Failure to do so
can result in loss of data — as well as time and money! Having a recent
backup enables you to recover quickly when the unexpected happens. It
might also ensure that you receive a paycheck at the end of the week.
Only Administrators and Managers of the ACT! database get to back up a data-
base. And, after it’s backed up, only Administrators can restore a database.
Because every database requires an Administrator, you automatically landed
the job if you are the only user of the database. If you need to back up the
database and find that the backup option is grayed out on the File menu, you
must find a database Administrator and wheedle him or her into changing
your permissions. In Chapter 3, I explain the various ACT! user permissions.
If you’re going to be making major changes to your database, such as import-
ing new records, deleting old contact records, or modifying existing fields, I
recommend creating a backup before you start — just in case!
You can set a reminder for backing up your database; I tell you how to do it in
Chapter 3.
When you create an ACT! database, ACT! thoughtfully automatically creates
several folders for you. In addition to a database folder that houses the main
database files, ACT! creates subfolders for your attachments, layouts,
queries, reports, and templates. When you back up your database, ACT! com-
presses all the data into a Zip file.
Very often, the ACT! database resides on a network drive and is backed up to
a tape drive on a daily basis. In this case, backing up your database using
ACT! is not necessary. However, you might be feeling a false sense of security
knowing that this backup is taking place. Don’t find out too late that your
tape backup was backing up the ACT! program and not the ACT! data files
themselves. Make sure that the database folder and all the subfolders are
included as part of your backup. Feeling scared? Remind your IT person that
his job security is directly related to the security of your database.
If you use backup software or store your data on an Internet site, remember
that an ACT! database consists of more than a single file. You must back up
all files whose filenames begin with the name of the database, as well as any
related folders that contain your various supplemental documents.
237
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

Performing the basic ACT! backup
You must have Administrator or Manager security level to back up your ACT!
database. Open the ACT! database that you want to create a backup copy of
and follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Back Up➪Database.
The Back Up dialog box appears displaying the location for the backup
database, as shown in Figure 17-2.
2. To back up the database to a different location from what’s showing,
click the Browse button, select a new location for your backup file,
and then click Save.
3. Select the option to password protect your database (optional).
Just in case you feel like spies are lurking about, you might want to pass-
word protect the backup file. However, you might not feel the urge to do
so knowing that only database Administrators can use the file.
4. Click the OK button.
An indicator bar appears, letting you know that ACT! is creating your
backup. The time required to complete your backup varies depending
on the size of your database and the supplemental files that are included
in your backup. When the backup is complete, a message appears telling
you that your backup was completed successfully!
Backing up to various media
Backing up a database is easy. The hard part is knowing where to place
your backup. For nearly 20 years, computer users relied on the floppy disk
as their backup method of choice. You may as well kiss those floppies good-
bye because they just aren’t big enough to hold your backup. By default, ACT!
places your backup file on your computer’s hard drive. That’s great if your
hard drive is ultimately being backed up, but not so great if it isn’t — and
your computer grinds to a painful halt. Here are a couple of good alternatives
to your backup housing dilemma:
Figure 17-2:
The Back
Up dialog
box.
238
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

 Zip drive: I know this sounds confusing but you can place your backup
Zip file on a Zip drive.
 USB storage drive: These tiny powerhouses can store the equivalent of
a hundred floppy disks on a device the size of your thumb.
 CD/DVD drive: These puppies come installed on most of the new PCs.
 External hard drive: The price of external hard drives has plummeted in
recent years; you might want to purchase one to store all your data files.
Restoring a backup copy of your database
A backup is no good if you don’t know how to use it to restore your data.
Although I hope you never have to use a backup copy, follow these steps to
restore a copy of your database:
1. Choose File➪Restore➪Database.
The Restore Database dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-3.
2. Select one of the restoration options and click OK.
• Restore: Restores all files to their original locations; this restore
option is most commonly used when data is lost or corrupted.
• Restore As: Allows you to restore the database to a new location
with a new filename; this option works well when you want to copy
a database or move it to another computer.
• Unpack and Restore Remote Database: Allows you to install a
database that synchronizes back to the main database.
3. Click the Browse button to navigate to the location where the backup
file is stored; click Save and then click OK.
You’ll notice that all your backup files ends with the .zip extension.
Figure 17-3:
Restoring a
backup.
239
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

Many of you are familiar with the .zip extension because you have
worked with the WinZip software. Do not be tempted to unzip an ACT!
backup file using WinZip. The files aren’t placed in the correct locations,
and the backup file probably is rendered useless!
4. Type the backup file password if prompted and click OK.
5. Type the Administrator’s name and password and click OK.
Yikes! ACT! shows you the scary warning message that you see in Figure
17-4. The warning explains in no uncertain terms that if you continue,
your database will be overwritten with older files. If your current data-
base is a corrupted mess, that’s a good thing; if your database is per-
fectly fine, that could be a bad thing!
6. Click Yes to acknowledge that you want to continue.
Your computer whirs and hisses for a few moments and soon the
restored database opens.
Backing up personal supplemental files
Your ACT! database comes with a set of database supplemental files that
include your layouts, and report and document templates. (Turn to Chapter 3
for more info about supplemental files.) The database supplemental files are
included in the regular ACT! backup. ACT! also allows you to keep a set of
personal supplemental files. These files can include saved documents and
reports that you create using an ACT! template, as well as any file attach-
ments that are of a more personal nature that you might not want to include
as part of the database. All database users have access to the database sup-
plemental files, but you are the only one with access to your personal supple-
mental files.
Because the personal supplemental files are not a part of the ACT! database,
you need to back them up separately from the rest of the database. Don’t
worry — the personal supplemental files are backed up in pretty much the
same way that you back up the rest of the database:
Figure 17-4:
Scary

240
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

1. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Back Up➪Personal Files.
The Back Up Personal Files dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-5.
2. Browse to the location to which you want to save your files and 
click OK.
3. Check the Password Protect File check box if you want to password-
protect the backup copy of your personal files.
4. Indicate whether to include your personal documents, Internet Links,
and spelling dictionaries in your backup, and then click OK.
That was fairly easy. If you indicated that you wanted password protection
you’re prompted to enter in the password. When the backup is complete, you
get a congratulatory confirmation message.
Performing Spring Housecleaning
The good news is that if you’re reading this, you’re probably the Administrator
of the ACT! database; after all, if you’re not the Administrator, you don’t have
the necessary permission to perform most of the administrative tasks. The
bad news is that with the job title comes quite a bit of responsibility — and
hopefully a large salary.
In addition to performing the obvious mechanical maintenance chores, you
probably want to do a little bit of extra house, er, database cleaning from time
to time. Having blank, duplicate, or incorrect contact information serves no
purpose other than to make your database perform less efficiently. So bite
the bullet, roll up your sleeves, and get cleaning.
Before you perform any type of maintenance, I strongly recommend that you
back up your database so that you can retrieve any data you accidentally
delete.

data files.

Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

Weeding out duplicate contacts
Finding pesky duplicates in your database is tricky but not impossible.
Because having multiple records for the same person or company is
common, ACT! allows you a way to easily check for duplicate records based
on predefined criteria. You can then create a lookup of the duplicate records
and delete them. You can also change the criteria used to find these duplicate
records.
By default, ACT! looks for duplicate contact records based on the company
name, contact name, and phone number. If the contents of these three fields
are identical for two or more contacts, ACT! views them as duplicates. 
1. From any ACT! view, choose Tools➪Scan for Duplicates.
As you can see in Figure 17-6, you can now specify how ACT! checks for
duplicate contact records in the Duplicate Checking dialog box.
2. In the Duplicate Match Settings area, choose the three fields you want
ACT! to use to search for duplicate contact data.
3. Click OK.
If ACT! finds any duplication in your database, the Contact List opens
along with a dialog box informing you that duplicates were found and
asking if you would like to combine them. From this list, you can delete
records, keep records, or combine duplicate records.
4. If you want to combine duplicates, click Yes to continue at the prompt.
The Copy/Move Contact data window opens. This is the first of six win-
dows that you go through when merging duplicate contacts. Merging
duplicates is a slow, grueling task; remember that once two contacts are
merged together, there is no “unmerge” function.
Figure 17-6:
Defining
duplication
criteria.
242
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

As you progress through the wizard you perform the follow six tasks:
• Select a pair of duplicates.
• Decide whether you want to copy the information from the first
contact record to the second contact record — or vice versa.
• Depending on your choice, one of the contacts becomes the
source, and the other one is the target. By default the new, merged
contact contains all the target information. If you want to retain
any source field information, click in the field and then click the
Copy button.
• As you see in Figure 17-7, you indicate in the fourth step if you
want to move additional information from the source to the target
or have the information remain duplicated on both records.
• Indicate whether to keep or delete the source record. For your con-
venience, ACT! recaps the information to make your decision
easier.
• If you decide to delete the source record, click Yes on the scary
warning that confirms that you might be losing information. Your
two duplicate records merge into one.
You cannot restore deleted records. If you inadvertently deleted important
information, run — don’t walk — to your backup file and restore your infor-
mation. For many of you, merging two contact records together is only the tip
of the iceberg. You need to repeat the merge process again for each pair of
duplicates in your database. And, after you complete the process, you might
want to start over again by changing the duplicate checking criteria.

243
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

As I stress throughout this book, having some semblance of uniformity is
very important. Lack of uniformity is a great way to sabotage your database.
A search for all your clients in Ft. Lauderdale does not include those clients in
Fort Lauderdale. In the same way, a company or contact might be duplicated
if it is entered into your database in two different ways. For example, you
might have John Q. Public and John Public, or ABC Company and ABC Co. ACT!
doesn’t recognize any of these examples as duplicates.
You can change the criteria that ACT! uses to look for duplicate records. To
find the duplicates that I mention in the preceding paragraph, you need to
use a different criterion for your search. Changing your search parameters to
search for duplicated phone numbers might just give you the results that
you’re looking for.
Removing old data
ACT! users tend to be extremely loyal; it’s not unusual to run into ACT!
fanACTics who have been using ACT! religiously for over 15 years. Over time,
the amount of information that is stored in ACT! gets larger and larger; over a
period of time that information may become less and less important. ACT!
provides you with a simple tool for clearing the clutter from your database; I
just wish I had a similar tool to clear the clutter from my closet!
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Remove
Old Data.
The Remove Old Data window opens, as shown in Figure 17-8.
Figure 17-8:
The Remove
Old Data
window.
244
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

2. In the Remove from Database area, select the type of data you want 
to remove and indicate the number of days that you want to use to
remove that data.
If you want to get rid of data that is older than a year, indicate 365 
days; if you want to get rid of data that is more than two years old, indi-
cate 730 days.
3. Click OK.
Like a champ, ACT! searches, scrubs, and ultimately removes any data that
matches your selection criteria.
Deleting a database
You may be wondering why you ever want to delete your database. That’s
good thinking because you’re right — you don’t want to delete your data-
base. However, you might have inherited several databases that you no
longer use, or perhaps you created a database or two for specific, temporary
purposes. In general, allowing users to have access to more than one data-
base is not a good idea; chances are pretty good that one of your users ends
up in the wrong database. Having a multitude of extraneous databases can
also put an extra strain on your resources and slow down your general 
performance.
Before deleting a database, I recommend backing it up, just in case. You
might also consider moving the database to another location for safekeeping
rather than deleting it.
Deleting a database is ridiculously simple and, once deleted, impossible to
undelete. Proceed with caution.
Okay, are you ready? Take a deep breath and follow these steps to delete the
database:
1. Open the database you wish to delete.
ACT! deletes the currently opened database. Be sure to close all other
databases. In previous versions of ACT! it was not possible to delete the
open database — only closed ones. Govern yourself accordingly!
2. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Database Maintenance➪Delete
Database.
The Delete Database window opens, verifying that you absolutely want
to delete, destroy, and make the current database disappear forever.
245
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

3. Click Yes to bid your database adieu.
Ironically, ACT! gives you two options to change your mind: No or Cancel
both serves to keep your database safely in place.
Copying or moving contact data
One of the neat utilities included with ACT! is the ability to copy or move
selected field information from one record to the next. One example of this
might occur if an existing contact leaves a company to work at another com-
pany. You might create a new record for the individual and then realize that
his previous record still contains pertinent information, such as his home
phone number and birthday. By using the Copy/Move command, you can
move that specific field information from his old contact record to his new
one. You can then edit the original contact record with the contact details of
the new, replacement person.
ACT!’s Copy/Move Contact Data function works almost exactly like the Scan
Duplicate function. The only difference is that unlike with the duplication pro-
cedure, you’re not presented with a list of contacts to start with. The onus is
on you to select two records whose field information you want to copy or
move.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Copy/Move Contact Data.
Look familiar? It’s the Duplicate Checking dialog box (refer to Figure 17-6).
2. Click Next to proceed through the wizard screens.
Proceed through the wizard while remembering a few key points:
• The source record is the record you want to copy data to.
• The target record is the record that contains the data that you want
to copy.
• You have the option to copy or move data on a field-by-field basis.
• You have the option to keep or delete the original source record.
Performing a global edit/replace
Another way that you can keep your database working well is by ensuring
that all fields contain consistent information. You might notice that some of
your contacts have the city listed in all capitals while others don’t. You might
see that some contacts are listed in Florida, whereas other contacts reside in
246
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

FL or Fla. This lack of consistency makes it extremely difficult to query your
database. Like a forgiving mother, ACT! provides you with the ability to cor-
rect the error of your ways. After you pinpoint your inconsistencies, you can
standardize them in one fell swoop (rather than by correcting each field on
an item by item basis); just do this:
1. Perform your lookup.
In the preceding example, you might create a lookup of FLA and then
add Florida to the mix. If you need help, flip to Chapter 7 and review the
section on lookups.
Unless you’re planning on changing field data for every contact in your
database, make sure you perform a lookup before proceeding. These
changes are irreversible! For example, say you notice 27 instances of Fla
that you want to change to FL. If you fail to do a lookup first, you end up
changing the State field for every contact in your database to FL rather
than just for the original 27 that you intend to change. Unfortunately,
unless you have a backup handy, you’re stuck with the changes because,
again, these changes are irreversible.
2. From any ACT! screen, choose Edit➪Replace Field.
You’re now looking at the Replace Data dialog box, shown in Figure 17-9.
If you prefer, you can choose one of the other two options as well:
• Swap Field: This option swaps the information between two fields.
• Copy Field: This option copies information from one field and
repeats it in a second field.
3. Select your desired field from the Replace Contents Of drop-down list.
You can select from virtually any of your contact fields with the excep-
tion of the system fields.
4. Enter the desired information in the Value field.
In this example, you type FL in the field. To make life even easier, ACT!
supplies you with the appropriate drop-down list based on the field you
indicated in Step 3.
Figure 17-9:
The Replace
Data dialog
box.
247
Chapter 17: Zen and the Art of Database Maintenance

5. Click OK.
6. Read the warning that appears.
Generally speaking, when life — or ACT! — gives you a warning, it’s a
good idea to heed it. ACT! is politely asking you to verify that you 
intend to change all the contact records in the current lookup (see
Figure 17-10). If you’re not sure as to the exact number of contacts in the
current lookup, click No, return to the Contact Detail window or Contact
List, and read the record counter in the top-left corner.
7. Click Yes.
ACT! might have to think about this for a moment depending on the
number of contact records in your lookup. When it finishes, you’ll notice
that the field that you indicated in Step 3 has now changed for each of
the contact records in your lookup.
A few more housekeeping tips
So far, I’ve talked about ways that ACT! can mechanically maintain the
integrity of your database. However, you, as the Administrator, can do a few
things to help ensure a healthy database:
 If your organization has customized the database, limit the number of
users who have permission to edit layouts and add new items to the
drop-down lists.
 Periodically clear unwanted items from the drop-down lists. Insist that
the users routinely pick items from the drop-down lists when entering
new data.
 To avoid duplication of contacts, emphasize the importance of querying
the database for an existing contact before entering a new one.
 Delete any fields not being used.
Figure 17-10:
Last chance
warning
before
replacing all
your data.
248
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 

 Delete outdated attachments, layouts, reports, templates, and queries.
 Be cognizant of field length. If you have a field that holds a Yes or No
value, consider trimming the field length down to three characters.
 Save contact records you rarely use to a different database, and then
remove them from the main database. Use a Contact Activity lookup to
locate infrequently used records.
 If you synchronize with remote databases, review and purge your syn-
chronization logs often.

Chapter 18
ACT!ing with Synchronizations
In This Chapter
 Understanding synchronizations
 Setting up the master database
 Setting up the remote database
 Performing a synchronization
O
ne of the most exciting new changes in ACT! 2005 is the change in 
synchronization procedures. In the past, synchronization was a very
delicate — and technical — operation; if not done correctly you had a great
chance of corrupting your database. With the advent of ACT! 2005, the syn-
chronization process has been streamlined. Although many steps are
involved, they are not hard or complicated.
The synchronization procedure I follow in this chapter refers to the method
used with ACT! 2005. I’m also assuming that remote users are connecting
their computers to the main computer’s network in order to synchronize. In
most cases, that involves bring in the remote user’s laptop and connecting it
to the network. Although connecting to the host computer using other meth-
ods (such as a VPN or terminal services) is possible, it’s beyond the scope of
this book.
What in the World Is Synchronization?
To understand synchronization, you need to know the following terms:
 The master database is the main database that contains all of your data.
 The remote database is a separate database being used by another user,
generally in a different location.

252
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
ACT! users commonly confuse backing up and restoring data with a true data
synchronization. If you back up your database and restore it on a remote
user’s computer, the remote user now has a carbon copy of your database.
This method works fine if the remote user doesn’t want to make any changes
to his database. However, if you both make changes to your respective data-
bases, you have no way of merging those changes. If you back up your data-
base and restore it once again to the remote user’s computer, you wipe out
any changes he has previously made.
Synchronization means that you can make changes from either the master or
the source database. It’s the exact same concept that’s used when you syn-
chronize your PDA to your computer. After synchronizing, changes made in
the master database are seen in the remote database and vice versa.
Why synchronize?
You may want to synchronize your data for several reasons:
 You want to share your database information with other remote users in
your organization and vice versa.
 Your database is located on an office server, but you need to keep your
information on a laptop for traveling purposes.
 You may want some of your users to have access to only portions of
your database for security purposes; ACT!’s synchronization allows you
to send and receive changes based on selected contacts so that your
remote user’s database contains only a portion of the entire master 
database.
The synchronization cycle in a nutshell
Here’s what happens during the synchronization cycle:
 Any changes that you made to your remote database are compiled into a
packet and sent back to the master database.
 When the master database “hears” the remote database, it accepts the
changes and sends out any changes that occurred in the master data-
base that affect the remote user.
 As other remote users sync to the master database, they can also
receive any contact changes that affect them, including ones made by
other remote users.

253
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
Things that change during 
a synchronization
When you synchronize your data, you merge any changes that you made to
your database with changes made by your remote user(s), including the 
following:
 Contact information: If you change a contact’s telephone number and
the remote user changes the address, ACT! merges both changes into
the original contact record. If you change the same contact’s telephone
number and the numbers do not match, ACT! applies the most recent
change.
 Notes and histories: If you both add notes, the contact record now
reflects all the notes and histories of both the master and remote users. 
 The Task List: Any tasks that either you or the remote users create now
appear in both the master and the remote databases. You can even
schedule an activity for your remote users.
 Calendars: Synchronization allows you to share the calendars of all the
users in your organization.
 Field definitions: If the master database has added, removed, or
changed fields, these changes are sent out to the remote users.
 Drop-down lists: Changes made in the master database to field drop-
down lists are sent to remote users.
 Layouts: New or customized contact, company, and group layouts syn-
chronize to remote users.
 Templates: Letters, reports, envelopes, and labels synchronize to
remote users.
 Attachments: All documents attached to the master and remote data-
bases synchronize; documents stored in your personal folders don’t 
synchronize.
Performing a Synchronization 
in Three ACT!s
The synchronization process consists of four parts: understanding the sync
process, setting up the master database, setting up the remote database, and
the actual sync process.

If you feel you are not up to the task, you might want to contact your local
ACT! Certified Consultant who arrives at your office wearing his or her
Superman costume. If you look carefully, you might even see his pocket pro-
tector under his T-shirt. Anyway, your friendly ACC can probably save you
hours of frustration — and ensure that your database doesn’t become cor-
rupted! You can find a list of ACCs by choosing Help➪Service and Support➪
ACT! Consulting.
ACT! 1: Doing your homework
Many of you may find that your knees are shaking. Relax, take a deep breath,
and plot your strategy. Before bravely forging ahead and attempting to sync,
you can do a little preparation.
If you were a Boy Scout, you learned to be prepared. Now that you are a
savvy user of ACT!, being prepared is even more important. Here are some
tips that make your synchronizations run more smoothly:
 Enter your data consistently. I know I sound like a broken record, but it
is worth repeating: Enter your data consistently. For example, if you
enter a contact’s company name as Tech Benders, Inc. and someone else
enters it as Tech Benders, you have duplicate contact records when you
synchronize data. To help enter data consistently, rely on drop-down
lists whenever possible.
 Determine which contacts to include in the remote user’s database.
This decision might involve setting up a query to identify those con-
tacts. If Joe is to receive all the contacts in the Southwest region, con-
sider adding a region field to your database — or at the very least,
identify those states included in the Southwest.
 Use the same criteria to search for duplicate records. ACT! matches
contact records using a Unique ID, which is an identifier assigned to
each record in your database. If you set up the synchronization proce-
dure correctly, identical contacts in all databases have the same Unique
ID. If both you and your remote users add the same contact to your data-
bases, each contact is assigned a different Unique ID. If the Unique IDs of
two records do not match, ACT! matches duplicate records using the cri-
teria you specify. To ensure that the synchronization process does not
create duplicate contact records, both databases need to use the same
criteria for determining duplicate records.
You can find out how to modify your duplicate record match criteria in
Chapter 17.

Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
 All users must have the same version of ACT!. You can’t synchronize an
ACT! 2005 database to an ACT! 6 database. You also can’t synchronize 
an ACT! 2005 database to an ACT! 2005 Premium database. Make sure
that all databases have the most recent version of ACT!:
• To display your current version, choose Help➪About ACT!.
• To update your version of ACT!, choose Help➪ACT! Update.
 Perform spring-cleaning on your database. Scan for duplicate records
and clean up your database before starting the synchronization process.
Turn to Chapter 17 to do so.
ACT! 2: Setting up the main database
You must follow a number of steps in order to set up a remote database.
Sound like a lot of work? Don’t worry; only Administrators and Managers
need apply because other users don’t have the appropriate rights to set up
synchronization. And, if you are an Administrator or a Manager, you can stop
hiding under your desk; although there are a lot of steps, they are all very
easy to follow.
Enabling synchronization
The first thing you need to do is to turn on the synchronization. Follow these
steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization panel opens, as shown in Figure 18-1.
Figure 18-1:
The
Synchro-
nization
panel.

256
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
2. Click the Enable Synchronization option in the Admin Tasks area and
then click Yes in the ACT! message dialog box.
Admit it — it doesn’t get much easier than that!
Defining a sync set
The sync set is the main list of contacts that the remote user receives. An
Administrator or a Manager of the remote database creates the sync set. On
the simplest level, the sync set consists of all contacts that the remote user
has permission to access. However, the Administrator might set up additional
criteria to limit the number of contacts that the remote user can access. After
you set the criteria, the remote user has the opportunity to add additional
contacts that he has permission to access to his database. Contacts that are
added to the remote database by the remote user would automatically
become part of the remote users sync set and the remote user has rights to
access the additional contacts.
Consider these key elements before creating a sync set:
 A sync set is only a starting point; remote users can add additional con-
tacts to their databases from the master database. 
 A sync set can include only contact records that the remote user has
permission to access.
 A sync set always includes all the master database Record Manager con-
tacts as well as all group and company records. The groups and compa-
nies populate only those records that the remote user has access to.
 Master database Administrators and Managers can create sync sets
based on a query.
 An Administrator or a Manager can copy, edit, or delete sync sets.
 More than one remote database can use a sync set; however, each
remote database has only one sync set.
Follow these simple steps to create a sync set:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization panel opens (refer to Figure 18-1).
2. Click the Manage Sync Set option in the Admin Tasks area.
3. Click Create New Sync Set and click Next.
Okay, I know you have several choices here, but for the purposes of this
section, create a brand new sync set. Just remember that you can
always go back and copy, edit, or delete your sync set later.

257
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
4. Give your sync set a name, an optional description, and then click Next.
What you decide to call the sync set is a big deal because you need to
recognize it by name later on down the road. If the sync set consists of
the contacts used by the remote sales guys, you might name the sync
set something clever like “Remote Sales Guys.”
5. Select the names of the remote users who will use the sync set, click
the right-pointing arrow and then click Next.
The remote user must be an active user of the master database, even if
he doesn’t have permission to access all records.
6. Decide on one of the following options:
• If you want to synchronize all the available contacts to the sync
users, select the Synchronize All Available Contacts option, click
Next, and then click Finish.
• If you want to further limit the contacts the remote user sees,
select the Define Sync Set Criteria option and then click Next.
The Sync Set Criteria window opens, as shown in Figure 18-2.
7. Choose the criteria you want to set the sync to:
• You only have one choice of field type — contact.
• In the Field Name drop-down list, select one of the available con-
tact fields.
• In the Operator drop-down list, select one of the available items,
such as Contains or Equal To (=).
• In the Value drop-down list, select one of the available items that
correspond to the selected field name.

8. Click the Add to List button.
As you add a criterion, it appears in the bottom section of the window.
Notice in Figure 18-2 that I am creating my sync set to include all con-
tacts in Florida that are managed by Gary.
9. To select more than one criterion, repeat Steps 7 and 8.
You might need to use the And/Or column to help you build the query.
And indicates that a contact must match all criteria; Or indicates that a
contact can match any one criterion.
10. Click the Preview button to see a list of all the contacts that match the
criteria you indicated.
You even see the total number of records that are included in the sync set.
11. When you’re happy with your results, click OK and then click Finish.
If necessary you can create or edit additional sync sets or click Home to
return to the main Synchronization dialog box.  
Creating the remote database
After you enable synchronization and create a sync set, you’re ready to
create the remote database(s). Once again, you return to the scene of the
crime — the Synchronization panel:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The Synchronization panel opens (refer to Figure 18-1).
2. Click Create Remote Database in the Admin Tasks area.
Like with most of the other ACT! tasks, you now follow a wizard through
the next several steps. Probably the hardest thing you have to do is click
Next at each juncture.
3. Give the remote database a name, click the Browse button to save the
new database to a different location if necessary, and click Next.
4. Select a sync set to use with the database and click Next.
You see the sync set you created earlier sitting there waiting for you.
5. Indicate the following choices and click Next.
• Allow database supplemental files to synchronize.
• Allow attachments to synchronize.
• Set the number of days that the synchronization expires. This
ensures that the remote user synchronizes on a timely basis or
risks having the database expire. After a database expires, the
remote user can’t synchronize until the Administrator of the main
database creates a new database for the remote user.

259
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
6. Give the database an optional password and click Finish.
7. Choose Tools➪Synchronize➪Accept Incoming Syncs.
The final step sets the master database in a wait-and-see mode. As the
Administrator, your job is almost finished. Time to sit back, pat yourself
on the back, and figure out a way to get that database to the remote
user.
Delivering the remote data
Your job as the grand poobah of remote database creation is just about done;
all good things must come to an end. The only thing you have left to do at
this point is to get that new database, along with all the associated files and
attachments, out to the remote users. But wouldn’t you know, ACT! has
solved that problem for you already. When you create the remote database,
you actually create a special backup file; unlike a traditional backup file, this
one comes with the .rdb extension. You can simply e-mail the file to the
remote user, or burn it to a CD and send it via snail mail.
ACT! 3: Setting up the remote database
When you set up the remote database and send it off by carrier pigeon to
your remote user, the ball is in the other guy’s court. Relax and go float in the
pool — just make sure to keep the cell phone on in case the remote user has
a question. And don’t forget the sunscreen!
Restoring the remote database
If you are the remote user, you have a few chores to do. Thankfully, none of
them are very hard. The first thing you need to do is restore the remote data-
base that the Administrator of the master database sent. This procedure
works pretty much the same way as the restore procedure that I discuss in
Chapter 17; the main difference lies in the fact that the remote database has a
different backup extension than a traditional database backup file.
Traditional backup files have the .zip extension. Remote database backup
files have the .rdb extension. Could it be that RDB stands for Remote
Database? You be the judge!
You, as the remote user, can follow these steps to set up the database:
1. Save the .rdb file that you receive from the master database
Administrator into an appropriate spot on your hard drive.
My suggestion is that you jot down the location so that you don’t have
to call the Administrator and ask for help. My experience is that
Administrators get very cranky when interrupted in mid-swim.

260
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
2. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Restore➪Database.
The Restore Database window appears.
3. Select the Unpack and Restore Remote Database option and then 
click OK.
The Unpack and Restore an ACT! Remote Database window opens.
4. Click the Browse button next to the Select the Remote Database File to
Restore field to locate the remote database (.rdb) backup file.
5. Click Browse to select a location for the restored database.
If you’re not going to store the database on a network, you’ll probably
find that the default location, located in your My Documents folder, fills
the bill nicely. If you’re sharing the database, save it to a place on your
network.
6. Select the Share This Database with Other Users option if you are
sharing the database with other users.
7. Click OK.
If the database you are restoring is password protected, type your secret
password and click OK. Don’t know the password? Your Administrator
might just have to finish his swim and supply you with it!
After you restore the database, you can open and begin using it just like any
other ACT! database. You can also begin to synchronize your data at any
time.
Depending on the access rights given to you by the master database
Administrator, you might not be able to perform various functions, such as
backing up your database. The same user rules apply to the remote database
as to the master database; you can’t delete contact records, notes, and other
things created by other users.
Synchronizing data
The remote user is the keeper of the synchronization key and the only one
who can initiate a sync. You’d think that having such a big responsibility
would entail a lot of work. Fortunately for you, it doesn’t.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronize.
2. Click the Synchronize Now option.
When you synchronize the database, two things happen:
• Any changes made in the remote database now appear in the
master database.
• Any changes made in the master database associated with contact
records included in the remote user’s sync set now appear in the
remote database.

261
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
The synchronization can take a few minutes depending on the number of
changes that have been made to both the remote and the master databases.
You see an indicator bar roll across your screen and then a congratulatory
message celebrating the fact that you have performed a successful synchro-
nization. You’re also asked to refresh your database so you don’t drive your-
self crazy looking for changes that might take a moment to appear.
Setting up automatic synchronization
In the standard edition of ACT!, the master database cannot receive sync
packets if other users are logged on to a multi-user database. Of course, one
way to get around this limitation is to come in at dawn — or stay until mid-
night — to perform your synchronization. For most of you, this option is not
what you have in mind! As the remote user, you might prefer to have ACT!
perform your synchronization automatically for you while you’re at home
snoozing.
Here’s how you set up an automatic synchronization:
1. Open the remote ACT! database.
2. Choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel. 
The Synchronization panel opens (refer to Figure 18-1).
3. Click Set Sync Schedule in the Users Tasks area.
The Sync Schedule window opens, as seen in Figure 18-3.
Figure 18-3:
Scheduling
an auto-
matic
synchron-
ization.

262
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
4. Indicate your scheduling preferences.
• Occurs: Indicate the frequency with which you want the synchro-
nization to occur.
• Occurs At: Indicate the date and time you want to commence using
the automatic synchronization.
5. Click Finish.
You must leave both the master and remote databases open so that 
synchronization updates are sent and received automatically at the spec-
ified times. And only one person can access each database at the time 
of synchronization.
Adding contact records to a sync set
Because a sync set is created based on a query and may be used for more
than one remote user, you might find that your database is missing some con-
tacts. These contacts represent people that you might have access to but
who didn’t match the criteria the Administrator used for the sync set.
Ironically, these contacts actually reside in the remote database even though
you can’t access them.
Sound confusing? To put it a little simpler, if you find that you’re missing one
of your contacts, you can add it to the database:
1. Choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel from any ACT! screen.
The Synchronization panel appears (refer to Figure 18-1).
2. In the User Tasks area, click Manage Subscription List.
You now see a list of all the contacts that you can access. The contacts
that are a part of the sync set are indicated with a check mark.
3. Click Add Contacts to Sync Set in the Subscription Tasks area.
The Contacts window opens, as shown in Figure 18-4.
4. Select the contact(s) from the list on the left, and then click the right
arrow button to add them to the remote database.
5. When you finish, click OK and then click the Finish button in the
Manage Subscription List window.
The additional contacts appear in your database after your next 
synchronization.

263
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
Maintaining the Synchronization
Wow! The worst is over. Your remote database is synching back to the master
database and life is beautiful. But meanwhile back at the ranch — or at least
at the master database — the Administrator’s job continues. You may want to
check a few minor details from time to time. Or you may decide that the fun
is over, and you no longer want to continue syncing.
Viewing the last data synchronized
The synchronization process goes so smoothly that you might be left won-
dering what, if anything, actually synchronized. Sure enough, you can easily
determine that by creating a lookup. Here’s all you need to do:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Lookup➪Advanced➪Last Synchronized.
The Last Synchronized window opens, as shown in Figure 18-5.
2. Specify the Lookup criteria:
• Last Session or Date Range: You can view either the last contacts
synchronized or the contacts that synchronized during a specific
date range.
• Record Type: Indicate whether you want to find contact, company,
or group records.
• Look In: Specify whether you want to find notes, opportunities, histo-
ries, and/or activities that changed during the last synchronization.
Figure 18-4:
Adding
contacts to

database.

264
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
3. Click the Find Now button.
The contact records that changed during the last synchronization are
shown in the lower section of the Last Synchronized window.
4. Click the Create Lookup button.
The Contact List now displays a list of all contacts that changed during
the last synchronization.
Looking up the Sync Set lookup
As an Administrator, you probably rush through your day; chances are you
occasionally forget something: lunch, your head — or maybe the contacts
included in a sync set. You can easily create a list of all the contacts that are
part of a sync set by choosing Lookup➪Advanced➪Sync Set. The Contact
List magically appears, displaying all the contacts included in the sync set.
The difficult part is figuring out what to do for lunch!
Viewing and printing sync settings
You might want to review the sync settings of your database that were cre-
ated for each of the remote databases. Again, this feat is easy to accomplish:

265
Chapter 18: ACT!ing with Synchronizations
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
The ever-familiar Synchronization panel appears (refer to Figure 18-1).
2. Click Manage Database in the User Tasks area.
The Synchronization window opens.
3. Select the name of your database and click View Settings in the User
Tasks area.
As you can see from Figure 18-6, you see the names of both the master
and remote databases, the sync server port, and the expiration period of
the database.
4. If you want to print out the results, click Print and then click Finish.
Stopping the synchronization process
All good things must come to an end, and so it is with your remote database.
You can severe the ties that bind the master database to the remote one in
three ways. After the synchronization stops, the only way to get it going again
is to completely create — or re-create — the remote database.
 Letting the expiration date expire: Remote databases are assigned an
expiration date when they are created. If the remote user fails to syn-
chronize during the allotted time period, the remote database no longer
can sync to the master database.
Figure 18-6:
Displaying
the sync
settings.

266
Part IV: Advanced ACT!ing 
 From the master database: The master database can disable synchro-
nization for a remote database and optionally allow one last synchro-
nization before disabling the remote database. The remote database
receives a notification that synchronization is disabled and is allowed
one last synchronization session.
 From the remote database: A user with Administrator rights can disable
the remote database so that it no longer synchronizes to the main data-
base. After a remote database is disabled, it is no longer a remote data-
base. The database can still be used as a standalone database.
To disable either a master or remote synchronized database, follow these
steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
2. In the Admin Tasks area of the Synchronize panel, click Disable
Synchronization.
3. When prompted, click Yes to disable the synchronization.
Re-creating a remote database
You may find yourself needing to send out another sync set to a remote user.
For example, the remote user might have forgotten to synchronize and finds
that his database has expired. Or maybe the remote user’s computer died a
slow and painful death and needs to be replaced. In any case, there is a
simple way to re-create a remote database:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Synchronization Panel.
2. Click Manage Database in the User Tasks area of the Synchronization
panel.
3. Select the remote database you want to re-create, click Recreate
Database and then click Yes.
4. Click the Browse button to specify a location to save the newly 
re-created database and then click OK.
ACT! whirs and hisses as it busily sets up the remote database again.
ACT! doesn’t complain about having to do this chore a second time. In
fact, you’re even rewarded with a happy message confirming that you
have indeed re-created the remote user’s database.
5. Click OK.

ace it. Microsoft is everywhere, and most probably you are running more
than one of its products on your computer. Like many other software
products, ACT! 2005 has taken the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” philoso-
phy. ACT! fully integrates with four of the most popular Microsoft products —
Outlook, Internet Explorer, Word, and Excel.
Although other Microsoft products don’t fully integrate with ACT!, you don’t
need to stop using them. For example, you can easily store PowerPoint pre-
sentations on the Documents tab for easy access.
Changing Your Outlook on Life
A common misconception I hear from potential ACT! users is that they don’t
need ACT! because they’re using Outlook. You might snicker at that sugges-
tion because by now you realize that Outlook is a PIM (personal information
manager) whereas ACT! is a true contact manager. I like to think of ACT! as
Outlook on steroids; try doing a mail merge, customize fields, or log in notes
in Outlook and you’ll see what I mean.
Still, some ACT! users find themselves needing to use Outlook for a variety of
reasons:
 His company is currently using Outlook to maintain the company 
calendar.
 She might use Outlook to keep track of personal addresses and informa-
tion that doesn’t belong in ACT!. 

Fortunately, you can teach ACT! and Outlook to share both their address
books and calendars with one another.
Sharing ACT! and Outlook address books
When using both ACT! and Outlook address books, you need to be aware of
how the integration works:
 You can import all your Outlook contact information — including
appointments, tasks, notes, and journal entries — into ACT!.
 You can view all ACT!’s e-mail addresses in Outlook.
 You can view all Outlook’s e-mail addresses in ACT!.
 You don’t see new Outlook contact information, appointments, tasks,
notes, and journal entries unless you reimport your Outlook data.
Importing Outlook into ACT!
ACT! very nicely includes Outlook as one of its import options. After all, more
people switch from Outlook to ACT! than from ACT! to Outlook. Here’s all you
need to do to import the Outlook data:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose File➪Import.
Backing up your database is a good idea before attempting to try some-
thing as tricky as a data import. Chapter 17 explains how to create an
ACT! backup.
The Import Wizard opens with a nice welcoming screen that you can
skip over by clicking Next.
2. Select Outlook as the type of data you want to import and click Next.
3. Specify that you want to import contact records and click Next.
Your contact records include the good stuff, such as the person’s name,
company, address, phone number, and shoe size.
4. Specify your import options and click Next.
The Specify Import Options screen opens, as shown in Figure 19-1.
• Outlook Contacts: Imports your Outlook contacts into ACT!.
• Exchange Contacts: Imports your Exchange contacts into ACT!.
Use this option only if you work for a large company that shares
your Outlook information on a network.
• Appointments and Tasks as ACT! Activities: Converts your
Outlook appointments and tasks into ACT! activities.
270

5. Map your Outlook fields to ACT! fields and click Next.
I personally love it when my software does all my work for me. ACT! has
already “translated” the existing Outlook fields into ACT! fields. For
example, Outlook’s Business Address Postal Code becomes ACT!’s Zip
Code field.
6. Click Finish.
Configuring Outlook’s address book to include ACT!
Using Outlook for your personal e-mail? You can view e-mail addresses stored
in Outlook from ACT! and vice versa. Although ACT! automatically detects
your default Outlook address book(s), Outlook isn’t quite that bright; you
have to tell Outlook where to find your ACT! data. Follow these steps to do so:
1. In Outlook, choose Tools➪E-mail Accounts.
The E-mail Accounts Wizard opens.
2. Select the Add a New Directory or Address Book option and click
Next.
3. In the Directory or Address Book Type window, select the Additional

received messages or for messages that you are creating.
Creating ACT! history from an e-mail received in Outlook
If you want to attach an Outlook e-mail message to a contact’s History tab,
follow these steps:
1. In Outlook, open the message to which you want to attach history.
2. Choose an option from the ACT! History drop-down list.
Don’t see the ACT! History option? Right-click the Outlook toolbar and
select ACT! History.
3. Click the Attach to ACT! 2005 Contact(s) button on the Outlook toolbar.

Creating ACT! e-mails in Outlook
If you’re in Outlook and feel the overwhelming desire to send e-mail to your
ACT! contacts, you can do so by following these steps:
1. Create a new message in Outlook.
2. Choose an option from the ACT! History drop-down list.
Don’t see the ACT! History option? Right-click the Outlook toolbar and
select ACT! History.
3. Click the To button on the new mail message.
The Select Names dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 19-3.
4. Select the name of your ACT! database from the Show Names from

5. Select a contact in the Type Name or Select from List drop-down list.
To speed up the process, type the first couple of letters of your intended
recipient’s first name.
6. Click OK.
Your message looks pretty much like what you see in Figure 19-4. Click
the Send button and you’re ready to go. Once again, you get to sit
around twiddling your thumbs while ACT! slaves away, creating a history
of the sent e-mail on the contact’s History tab.

ACT! to Outlook, Outlook to ACT!, or a two-way sync.
3. Select a date option in the For These Dates area.
If you chose the Date Range option, you’re to select a starting and
ending date. Always synchronizing from today forward to speed up the
process is a good idea.
4. Click Update.
If you are using ACT!, Outlook, and a PDA, you need to make a decision as to
which program to use in order to sync your handheld device. If you attempt
to synchronize both ACT! and Outlook to your PDA chances are quite high
that you end up with duplication of your contacts and activities. You’re safer
synchronizing ACT! and Outlook through ACT! and then synchronizing your
PDA to just one of your databases.
Removing Outlook activities from ACT!
After you synchronize your Outlook and ACT! activities, you might want to
remove them. If you realize immediately that your synchronization didn’t
work entirely as planned, you can always restore an ACT! backup. You can
also simply remove any synchronized activities.

1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪Outlook Activities➪Remove
Activities.
The Remote Activities dialog box appears.
2. Select the appropriate option:
• To remove ACT! activities from Outlook, select the ACT! Activities
from Outlook check box.
• To remove Outlook activities from ACT!, select the Outlook
Activities from ACT! check box.
• To remove both types of activities, select both check boxes.
3. Click OK.
This procedure removes only Outlook activities added to your calendar
through the synchronization process. It has no effect on Outlook activities
imported to your database through importing.
Displaying Outlook activities in ACT!
You can view — or not view — your Outlook activities in ACT! in a number of
ways. Your Outlook activities appear on your Task List, calendars, and even
on the Activities tab.
Viewing Outlook activities on the ACT! Activities tab
A major difference between ACT! and Outlook is in the way that the two pro-
grams schedule activities. I consider Outlook to be somewhat of a free-for-all;
scheduled activities are not generally associated with a specific contact. Not
so with ACT!; Chapter 9 shows you how every activity must be associated
with a contact record.
Because of this difference in scheduling procedures, you don’t find your
Outlook activities on the Activities tab of an individual contact. You do, how-
ever, see all your Outlook activities on the Activities tab of your own My
Record contact.
1. Display your My Record contact by choosing Lookup➪My Record.
2. Click the Activities tab.
You’ll notice that your Outlook activities have a unique icon displaying
in the Type column. The discerning eye also notes that all your Outlook
activities display in a fetching shade of blue, and all your ACT! activities
are in black.

Now, here comes the really cool part: You can edit every one of those syn-
chronized activities. For example, even though all the Outlook activities
appear on the Activities tab of your own My Record, you can edit the activity
with a simple double-click and change the Schedule With person to any one
of your contacts. By doing that, the activity disappears from your own record
and reappears on the other contact’s record.
Viewing Outlook activities from ACT!’s Task List
Viewing your Outlook activities in your Task List requires a bit more fiddling,
but I know you’re up to the (Task List) task. Please, no groaning!
1. Click the Task List icon on ACT!’s Navigation bar.
2. Click the Options button on the Task List toolbar and select Show
Outlook Tasks.
What? You don’t see a Task List toolbar? Click the Show Filters button —
and read all about list filters in Chapter 5. You see the same Outlook icon
and colors that you see on the Activities tab.
Viewing Outlook activities in ACT! calendars
By now, it probably comes as no surprise to you that your Outlook activities
magically appear on all your ACT! calendars. In fact, it probably would have
been a surprise if I had said you can’t see them.
1. Click the Calendars icon on ACT!’s Navigation bar.
The daily calendar pops open. Because your Outlook activities appear
on all your calendars, feel free to select Work Week, Weekly, or Monthly
from the Calendar toolbar.
2. Click the Options button and select Show Outlook Activities.
The nice thing about ACT! is the consistency that you see throughout
the program. If the Options button is MIA, remember to click the Show
Filters button.
Viewing ACT! activities from Outlook
All your ACT! activities that you synchronize to Outlook are now accessible —
and editable — in Outlook. Because ACT! and Outlook activities are created
differently, your ACT! activities look a bit different when you view them in
Outlook. The main difference lies in the association between activity and con-
tact that Outlook doesn’t have. However, an ACT! activity opened in Outlook
displays all the associated contacts in the Details area, as you can see in
Figure 19-6.
277
Chapter 19: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

Exploring the Internet
The Internet Services button sits on the bottom of the Navigation bar; when you
click it, Internet Explorer opens, albeit with a different home page than you’re
used to seeing. You’ll notice that all your favorites are intact and that you can
navigate through the Web until the cows come home.
Because ACT! is all about contacts, it only seems logical that you might want
to view a contact’s Web site. Accomplish this feat of daring by following these
steps:
1. Click the Web site address that you entered into the contact record.
You’ve probably already noticed that the Web site appears to be blue,
and that when you hover the mouse over the field, your cursor turns
into a pointing hand indicating that this is a link. If you click the link,
you’re hurled into the exciting world of the Internet.
2. Internet Explorer launches and displays the contact’s Web site.
3. After you peruse the site and are ready to continue working in ACT!,
close the browser.
Taking advantage of Internet Links
If you’re like me, you like to take advantage of the abundance of information
on the Internet. Even more important to me — and probably to you, too — is
the ability to find information about contacts. As its name implies, ACT!’s
Internet Links link your contact information to a site on the Internet. Among
the most frequently used informational sites are the various Yahoo! pages
Figure 19-6:
An ACT!
activity
displayed in
Outlook.
278
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

that help you find information on anything from a local weather report to dri-
ving directions and maps. By using an Internet Link in ACT!, you can access
these sites in a new, unique way: Yahoo! searches for your information based
on the information in the current contact record.
If one of your contacts is located in Boca Raton, Florida, you can go to that
contact’s record and click the Yahoo! Weather link to find the local Boca
Raton weather report. If your My Record has you listed in the city of Miami
and you’re currently on the record of a contact located in Fort Lauderdale,
the Yahoo! Driving Directions link supplies you with the driving directions to
get there.
You can program an Internet Link between your ACT! information and virtu-
ally any site on the Internet. However, creating a new Internet Link is doable,
but rather complicated. To make life easy for you, Stan Smith, a generous
spirited ACT! Certified Consultant from Birmingham, created links to nine
popular Yahoo! pages that you can download free by visiting http://tech
benders.com/act4dummies.htm and downloading the NetLink package.
Who said there’s no such thing as a free lunch?
Using one of the Internet Links
After you create — or borrow a pre-existing — Internet Link, you get to use it.
And that’s definitely a very simple process.
1. In ACT!, display the contact record containing the information that
you want to use.
2. Choose View➪Internet Services➪Internet Links.
You see a menu featuring the Internet Links installed on your computer.
3. Choose the site that you want to link to.
Depending on the site that you’re linking to, you might be asked to con-
firm the information that you’ve selected in ACT!. Internet Explorer then
displays the results; the My Record information appears on the left side
of the screen, and the contact’s information is on the right.
Internet sites are extremely volatile — here today, gone tomorrow. If an
Internet Link fails to function, maybe the site has changed its content
information or disappeared from the scene altogether.
Excelling in Excel
At the risk of sounding like a nerd, my accounting background has turned me
into an Excel junkie. Apparently I’m not alone because ACT! supplies you with
numerous opportunities to interface with Excel. 
279
Chapter 19: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

280
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 
Excel, the Opportunities List, and pivot tables
Because the Opportunities List deals with num-
bers and dollar amounts it is probably the list
that you’ll most often want to see in Excel. And,
just like with the Contact, Group, and Company
lists, one click is all it takes.
Remember: You can list only one product in the
Product Name column of the opportunity in
either ACT! or Excel. Opportunities with multi-
ple products list the first product name followed
by an ellipsis (. . .).
Now here comes the cool part: When you
export the Opportunities List to Excel, your infor-
mation is automatically translated into a pivot
table and chart. What exactly is a pivot table?
Well, according to Microsoft, “in a pivot table,
each column or field in your source data
becomes a pivot table field that summarizes
multiple rows of information.” What that means
is that you get some neat looking tables like the
one you see in the following figure and that you
can manipulate those charts to your heart’s
content.
After Excel opens with your Opportunities List,
just click the Opportunities pivot table or the
Opportunities Pivot tab to introduce yourself to
the exciting world of pivot tables!
Exporting a list to Excel
Very often, ACT! users want to export a part of their database to Excel. Perhaps
they need to get information to a non-ACT! user. Or maybe they want to manip-
ulate the data in a different way. It could be that they need to import their ACT!
information into another program, and Excel is the vehicle of choice.

If you look closely, you find hints of Excel throughout ACT! 2005. Specifically,
if you look really close to the Contact List, Group List, and Company List icon
bars, you see an icon that looks like a mini-spreadsheet. Figure 19-7 shows
the icon. If you pause your mouse on it for a second, you see that the button
is called Export to Excel.
Funnily enough, the button works exactly as you would suspect. Click it and
Excel opens, displaying the list view that you’re currently in. Don’t see the
field you’re looking for? Is Excel showing you a field you didn’t want? No
problemo. If you customize the list to show just the fields you want (find out
how to do that in Chapter 6), Excel displays those very same fields.
Because other programs can easily use Excel data, only Standard, Manager
and Administrator ACT! users can export list data to Excel.
Importing a product or drop-down
list into ACT!
I’ve never figured out whether I’m lazy or smart — or a little of each.
Whatever, I love to use shortcuts to save myself valuable time. If you’re a new
user of ACT!, you might have already developed a rather lengthy Product List
in another piece of software. For example, you might have created a Price
List using Excel or created an Inventory List in your accounting software. If I
didn’t like you so much, I’d tell you to start typing, but instead I tell you how
to export that list from Excel into ACT!.
To import data into ACT!, follow these steps:
1. Save the Excel file as a comma-delimited file.
2. In ACT!, choose Tools➪Define Fields➪Manage Drop-Down Lists.
3. Select the field into which you want to import the data, click Edit
Drop-Down List, and click Next.
4. Choose the Import Drop-Down List Items option.
From here, browse to the place where you saved the .csv Excel file and
watch while ACT! brings in your list of information — and saves you a lot
of typing.

Mapping ACT! fields to Excel
Another excellent ACT! feature (pun intended) is the ability to map specific
ACT! contact, group, or company fields to Excel cells. Here’s what you need
to know to accomplish that feat.
1. Add an Excel spreadsheet to the Documents tab.
2. Click the Documents tab, select the spreadsheet, and then click Edit
Document.
The spreadsheet opens. You’ll notice that after you install ACT!, Excel is
now the proud owner of a new ACT! menu just like the one in Figure 19-8.
If you prefer, you can attach a spreadsheet to ACT! while you’re in Excel
by choosing ACT!➪Attach to ACT!.
3. In Excel, select the Excel cell you want to map to an ACT! field.
4. Choose ACT!➪Map to Contact (or Company or Group).
The Map Fields dialog box opens. As you scroll through the list you’ll
notice that all of the fields are in it.
5. Select the ACT! field you want to map to the selected Excel field and
click Add.
You can easily add as many fields as you want by selecting an Excel cell,
choosing an ACT! field, and then clicking the Add button to “map” the
two together. Each ACT! field name appears in angle brackets in the
Excel cell.
6. Save and close the spreadsheet when you finish.
7. In ACT!, select the spreadsheet on the Documents tab and then click
the Map to Excel button.
The fields automatically update with the corresponding field entries
when the document opens.

What’s in a Word?
ACT! can use Word as the default word processor (see Chapter 3 to appoint
Word as your word processor), and you attach documents to the Documents
tab (see Chapter 5). What you might not have noticed, however, is that when
you install ACT!, it adds an ACT! menu to Word (as shown in Figure 19-9).
You can use Word’s ACT! menu to help you with several tasks.
Attaching a document to a contact record
Follow these steps to attach a document to a contact’s Document tab:
1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Attach to ACT!.
The Select Contacts window opens.
3. Select the contact to whom you want to attach the document and 
click OK.
In essence, you’ve created a link to your document. If you look carefully,
you’ll notice something new on the Documents tab — an icon that
matches the type of document you’ve just added. So, if you added a
Word document, you see the familiar-looking Word icon smack dab in
the middle of your Documents tab as well as the name and path of the
attached file. Go ahead, make my day: Click the icon. The attached docu-
ment miraculously opens in all its glory.
Sending a document as an e-mail
In this age of viruses, you’re probably hesitant to send too many attachments
knowing that the recipient might not even open it. If you’re using Word to
create your documents, here’s a simple way to convert the document into the
body of an e-mail:
Figure 19-9:
The ACT!

283
Chapter 19: Integrating ACT! with Microsoft

1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Send Email.
The Select Contacts window opens.
3. Select the contact you want to send the e-mail message to, click the
right arrow button, and then click OK.
The New Message window appears.
4. Type the subject and then click Send.
Through the wonders of modern science — or at least the wonders of
ACT! — a history of your sent e-mail appear on the contact’s History tab.
Sending a document in a fax
If you want to fax a Word document, follow these steps:
1. Open or create a document in Word.
2. From Word, choose ACT!➪Send Fax.
The Select Contacts window opens.
3. Select the contact you want to send the fax message to, click the right
arrow button, and then click OK.
Your fax software now opens. At this point, you need to follow the
instructions of your fax software with one big difference — ACT! creates
a history of your fax.
The ability to fax using ACT! is dependent on having access to fax software
and a phone line. The various options for sending a fax depend on the fax
software installed on your computer. If the fax option is grayed out, you can’t
fax because your machine is lacking the proper software.
Showing ACT!’s mail merge fields
Sometimes in your zealousness, you might close the list of mail merge fields
that opens when you edit or create a template (see Chapter 13 to find out
how to create a template). Not to worry — getting them back is easy enough.
In Word, choose ACT!➪Show Field List. The Add Mail Merge Fields dialog box
reappears — and you can continue adding fields to your template.

ACT!ing on Your Opportunities
In This Chapter
 Creating an opportunity
 Completing the sale
 The Opportunity List
 Tracking your opportunities through the various sales stages
I
n this chapter, I lead you through the entire sales process using ACT!. I
show you how to create an initial opportunity, make changes to it as the
sale makes its way through the sales funnel, and view your opportunities by
using the Opportunity List and various ACT! reports.
Creating Opportunities
ACT! was originally created by a sales person for sales people. Ironically,
many users of the earlier versions of ACT! found the program a bit lacking
when it came to tracking sales opportunities. Happily, ACT! 2005 includes a
totally revamped Opportunities module.
In ACT!, an opportunity is a potential sale to a contact. Each opportunity must
be associated with a contact. All sales information for a contact appears on
the Opportunities tab of the contact record. (Figure 20-1 shows an example 
of the Opportunities tab.) When you create an opportunity, you can list the
names of your products or services, specify a sales stage and forecasted
close date, and even make use of eight customizable fields. Click a button,
and ACT! generates a quote. You can even schedule a follow-up activity for
the opportunity.
After creating an opportunity, you can go to the Opportunity List where you
can see all your opportunities listed together or view the contact’s, group’s,
or company’s Opportunities tab. As if that isn’t enough, you can choose from
a slew of sales reports, including a sales graph. Whew!

By automating the sales process using ACT!, you have a better chance at clos-
ing more sales. First of all, if you’re following up on your activities as I show
you in Chapter 9, you have significantly fewer contacts falling through the
cracks of your database. Secondly, you can adjust your predictions as the
opportunity moves through the sales stages. Most importantly, you can gen-
erate reports based on your projected sales, allowing you to focus on the
deals that you think you have the best chance of closing.
Initiating the opportunity
So why are you sitting around reading a book? It’s time for you to go out there
and make some money. Here’s how you’re going to make your first million:
1. Go to the Contact Detail window by clicking the Contacts icon on the
Nav bar.
2. Perform a lookup to find the contact for whom you’re creating an
opportunity.
What? A little rusty on those lookups? Fear not — and head to Chapter 7
for a quick refresher.
Figure 20-1:
The
Opportu-
nities tab.
286
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

3. Create a new opportunity by clicking the Opportunities tab and then
clicking the New Opportunity icon.
If you have a bit of trouble locating the New Opportunity icon, it’s under-
standable; it’s the icon on the Opportunities tab that looks like a graph.
You also know you’re on the right track when you pause your cursor
over the button; a ToolTip proclaiming New Opportunity shows up.
The Opportunity dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 20-2.
4. Give the opportunity a name.
After you create the opportunity, you track it down by doing a Name
lookup, so you may want to assign a name that starts with the company
name that you’re doing business with. If you don’t give the opportunity a
name, ACT! assigns one for you automatically: New Opportunity.
5. Associate the opportunity with a contact.
After all, ACT! is contact-centric and needs to associate each opportu-
nity with a given contact.
6. Assign a sales status.
This option is a fairly simple one. All new opportunities are assigned the
Open status.
7. Assign a sales process.
Here’s where ACT! really forces you to get organized. Although not nec-
essary, you possibly have more than one Process List with your oppor-
tunities. You might use one for the pre-sales steps that you want
everyone in your organization to follow and another for the steps that
you need to follow once you land that large deal.
Figure 20-2:
The
Opportunity
dialog box.
287
Chapter 20: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

Each process comes with its own list of stages. Your homework is to 
verbalize your sales processes and translate them into ACT! (see
Chapter 15). Doing so keeps you organized, lets you know where you
stand in the scheme of things, and allows you to generate some useful
sales reports later on down the road.
8. Assign a sales stage.
If you’re hearing a nagging voice in the back of your head, it’s because
I’m nagging you. An important concept in computing is Garbage In,
Garbage Out (GIGO). You want to set the sales stage so you know where
this opportunity lies in your sales pipeline and so that this opportunity
doesn’t fall by the wayside. And, you’ll want to go back and change the
stage as the opportunity progresses through your sales cycle.
9. Enter a probability of closing.
This step could be rather easy because you can assign probabilities to
each sales stage when you set up the sales process. Feel free to over-
write the probability percentage based on your own hunches for each
opportunity.
10. Enter the estimated close date.
Again, you use this information for sorting and reporting later.
All that’s left for you to do is fill in the Product/Services, User Fields, Details,
and Opportunity Info tabs — a little time consuming, but you reap the
rewards later for all your hard work now.
Product/Services tab
If you’re like most people, this part is fun. Here’s where you get to count the
cash, bill for the beans, dream of the dollars. . . . In any event, the
Products/Services tab is where you get to add all the line items for your
opportunity and sit back while ACT! crunches the numbers for you.
Although the process of adding products or services to an opportunity is
pretty straightforward, I walk you through it, just in case:
1. Click the Add button.
2. Choose a name from the Name drop-down list.
If you’re selling a new item, scroll to the bottom of the list and click Edit
List to add it.
Chapter 15 gives you the full lowdown on creating a Product List.
3. Add an item number.
If you filled in all the appropriate item numbers when creating your
Product List, this step isn’t necessary.
4. Enter the quantity.
288
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

5. Double-check the cost and price.
This information fills in automatically from your Product List. If the
information is incorrect, head back to the Product List to correct it.
6. Adjust either the adjusted price or the discount percentage.
If you lower (or raise!) a price, ACT! automatically calculates the dis-
count percentage. If you prefer to tinker with the percentage, ACT! auto-
matically adjusts the price.
7. Get out your abacus and multiply the quantity by the adjusted 
price — not!
Throw out the calculator because ACT! does the calculation for you —
and even totals up all the line items for you. You’ll also notice a weighted
total that multiplies the total against the probability percentage. And
unlike me, ACT! never makes a mistake!
8. Repeat Steps 1 through 7 as many times as necessary until your oppor-
tunity includes all the necessary line items.
User Fields tab
The User Fields tab consists of eight customizable fields. Chapter 15 explains
how you can customize those eight fields by renaming and customizing them.
You might be a manufacturer’s rep and want to indicate your eight major lines.
Or you might want to indicate the eight manufacturers you deal with. Don’t
forget that you can query and generate reports with these fields so use them
wisely. You can check out the Opportunity User Fields tab in Figure 20-3.
289
Chapter 20: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities
Giving ’em a discount
You can create discounts on an item-by-item
basis by either changing the adjusted price or
the discount percentage. That works pretty well
for most situations, but you might prefer to add
the discount rate as a totally separate line item.
In order to do this, you need to add a Discount
Item entry to your Product List. Because the dis-
count amount varies, you need to manually
insert the amount of the discount each time you
create a new opportunity.
To create a discount item, follow these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Tools➪
Define Fields➪Manage Product List➪Add.
2. Type a name for the discount, such as
Discount.
To use the discount item
1. From the Opportunities tab, add or edit an
opportunity.
2. Add a new item and choose Discount from
the Name list. If you want to make this the
bottom item, you probably want to choose
Discount as your last item.
3. In the Adjusted Price field, type in a hyphen
(–) followed by the discount amount for the
order.

Details tab
In general, a database consists of many fields with each containing a single
piece of information. But people are people and sometimes storing all your
important information into a bunch of teeny tiny fields isn’t possible. That
said, you can use the Details tab to write the Great American Novel — or at
least a few important tidbits of additional info — about your opportunity.
If the information that you want to include with the opportunity is in a docu-
ment, such as a word processing file, you can copy the text in the other appli-
cation and paste it on the Details tab.
Opportunity tab
By now your mind is probably fogging over from all the information that
you’re inputting. The information on the User Fields, Details, and
Opportunity Info tabs are purely optional, albeit helpful. If your poor fingers
are wearing down to little stubs, you can always go back and complete the
rest of this information later.
Those of you with the stamina to make it this far will notice a few of the cool
pieces of information stored on the Opportunity Info tab. The rest of you can
sip your lemonade and gaze at Figure 20-4.
 Open Date: By default, ACT! assigns today’s date to a new opportunity.
This is where you can change it if necessary.
 Record Manager: By default, the name of the logged-on user appears as
the opportunity’s Record Manager. Feel free to change it if necessary.

a ham and the little guys get a fruitcake at holiday time — you might just
want to attribute each of your opportunities to the appropriate source.
 Competitor: If you keep one eye on the competition, here’s where you
can do it.
Click the Activity Follow Up button. Getting all your information into a sales
opportunity is only half the fun. The other half consists of sticking to your
original course of action. You get to set up your follow-up activity in the
Schedule Activity dialog box. You’ll notice in Figure 20-5 that ACT! inserts the
opportunity name and stage into the Regarding field. Then click OK. You’ve
just gotta love a program that does so much of your work for you!

Chapter 20: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

At this point, you’re essentially done with creating the opportunity. Sit back,
relax a moment, and then go out and start selling your heart out!
Modifying the opportunity
As your opportunity progresses, going back and modifying the sales stage is
often necessary. Again, this information appears in your various reports, so
updating your opportunities is vitally important. This process is painless and
short:
1. Find the opportunity that you want to update.
You have several choices here:
• Create a lookup for the contact associated with the opportunity,
and then click the Opportunity tab. On the Opportunities tab,
double-click the opportunity.
• From the Opportunity List, double-click the opportunity that you
want to modify.
• From any of the ACT! screens, choose Lookup➪Opportunities and
then select one of the field choices. For example, you can search
by opportunity name, product, or status. ACT! then scurries
through your database and opens the Opportunity List, which pre-
sents you with all opportunities that met your search criteria.
Double-click the opportunity you want to modify.
The Opportunity dialog box opens (refer to Figure 20-2).
2. Change the information in the Stage field as necessary.
The purpose of ACT!’s opportunities is to allow you to track a potential
sell from its inception to its final outcome. You’ll probably find editing
your opportunities useful as they progress through the various sales
stages. This allows you to view any of your opportunities to assess
exactly where you stand.
3. Schedule another follow-up if necessary.
4. Click OK when you finish editing the opportunity.
The biggest challenge for many busy people is remembering to take care of
all those nagging little details. Chapter 10 focuses on the activity series. You
might consider creating a sales activity series and including “updating sales
stage” as one of the steps.
292
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

Closing the deal
When you close a sale, you can record the outcome and the closing date.
ACT! records a history on the contact’s History tab, and if you associated the
opportunity with a group or company, on the History tab for the group and
company as well.
1. Find the contact for whom you’re recording the outcome of an 
opportunity.
2. On the Opportunities tab, double-click the opportunity that you want
to complete.
3. Change the status to indicate the current state of the opportunity in
the Opportunity dialog box.
• Open
• Closed-Won
• Closed-Lost
• Inactive
4. Click OK.
The opportunity remains on the Opportunities tab. The status changes to
Won, Lost, or Inactive depending on the choice you made. The Actual Close
Date updates to reflect today’s date.
You Can Quote Me on That
After you create an opportunity, ACT! can convert it into a quote for you. The
quote template actually consists of two pieces:
 The quote.adt file, which Word creates. You can edit the template by
changing the fonts, graphics, and wording. Typically, the .adt file con-
tains information about both you and your contact and can also contain

 The quote.xlt file is created in Excel and embedded into the .adt file.
It appears as a table in the center of a quote and contains numeric data,
such as quantity, pricing, and totals. Because of the way that the .xlt
file is created, you’ll probably not want to make any changes to the file;
doing so may run the risk of leaving the quote generator inoperable.

Chapter 20: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

Only one quote template works directly from the Opportunity dialog box. If
you create other quote templates, use them to fill in contact information, but
leave the product information blank.
Because the quote template consists of both a Word document and the
embedded Excel table, you must have both programs installed on your com-
puter in order to generate quotes using ACT!. You also need to set your word
processor preference to Word in order to edit the quote.adt template;
Chapter 3 shows you how to do that. You can see a quote in Figure 20-6.
Creating a quote for an opportunity
You can literally create a quote at the click of a button. And here’s how you
find the button:
1. Open an existing opportunity.
2. Click the Quote button on the Products/Services tab.
3. If you set the preferences to prompt you for a quote number, type the
number in the Enter Quote Number field and click OK.
After a moment or so of whirring and hissing, Word opens, revealing the
quote, which is all filled out and ready to go.

Chapter 3 focuses on the various ACT! preferences settings. Buried away
in those settings is one that determines whether you’re prompted to
supply a quote number every time you generate a quote. At the same
time, you can indicate the numbers and/or letters that you want to
include in the beginning of each quote number. You find those settings
by choosing Tools➪Preferences➪Quote Preferences.
Want to change the order in which your products appear on your quote?
It’s easy. Simply click the appropriate column heading on the Products/
Services tab in the Opportunity dialog box. Want the products sorted
alphabetically? Click the Name column heading. Want them sorted by
price? Click the Subtotal column heading.
4. Print and save the quote as you do any other Word document.
Editing the opportunity quote template
As I mention earlier, you can’t fiddle with the Excel portion of the quote tem-
plate; doing so could cause your calculations to not calculate. You can, how-
ever, modify the Word portion of the quote template to your exacting
specifications. Chapter 13 goes into greater detail about the exciting world of
template modifications, but for now, here’s a quick refresher course.
1. From any ACT! screen, choose Write➪Edit Template.
2. Choose quote.adt and then click Open.
3. Edit the template as necessary and then save it.
When you click the Quote button in the Opportunity dialog box, ACT! auto-
matically looks for the quote.adt template file. Although I advocate saving
templates and reports as other, unique names when attempting to modify
them, the same theory does not hold true for the quote template. If you
change the name, you can’t access it from the Opportunity dialog box — and
your product information doesn’t magically pour into it. Do not change the
name of the opportunity quote!
Viewing the Opportunity List
The Opportunity List provides you with a way to view all your opportunities
for all of your contacts. You can filter the Opportunity List to display only
those opportunities that match your specifications. You can then print 
the Opportunity List. Or, if you are really ambitious, you can export the
Opportunity List to Excel where you find Pivot Tables waiting patiently 
for you. Not sure what a pivot table is? Head back to Chapter 19 for more
details.

Chapter 20: ACT!ing on Your Opportunities

Getting to the Opportunity List is almost too easy: Just click the Opportunity
List icon on the Navigation bar. A list of opportunities appears, as you can
see in Figure 20-7. The Opportunity List even comes equipped with a status
bar running across the bottom that displays the total number of opportuni-
ties, the weighted total, and the grand total. You’ll also notice that the
Opportunity List comes equipped with its very own toolbar containing icons
specifically pertaining to the Opportunity List.
Filtering the Opportunity List
If you hate to make a decision at the ice cream store, you might not appreci-
ate the Opportunity List filters. But if you’re the kind of person who loves to
have things, well, exactly the way you want them, then you’re going to love
the Opportunity List!
The various filter options are located at the top of the Opportunity List
window. As you change filter options, the Opportunity List changes to
include the options you select. After this is set, you can click the Hide Filters
button in the upper-right corner of the Opportunity List. Don’t see any fil-
ters? Click the Show Filters button that appears instead.

Feel free to choose from the following Opportunity List filters:
 Dates: Limits the opportunities to those matching the estimated closing
date that you indicate.
 Status: Indicates whether you want to view Open, Closed-Won, Closed-
Lost, Inactive, or all opportunities. You can also choose None, which
frankly doesn’t make a whole lot of sense because then you don’t see
any of your opportunities!
 Process/Stage: If you set up more than one series of sales processes,
here’s where you indicate which one you like to see.
 Probability: Type the percent you want to use; you can find opportuni-
ties that only match a specific percentage, or those that are greater than
or less than a given percentage.
 Total: Type the amount you want to use or choose whether to view
opportunities that are greater than or less than a given amount.
 Select Users: Selects the names of the Record Managers associated with
the opportunities you want to view.
 Options: Actually, you have only one true filtering option here; select
Show Private to display your private opportunities. You’ll also notice the
Customize Columns options that let you add, remove, and change the
order of your columns.
Resetting the Opportunity List filters
After you diligently work to set all your filters, you’re probably going to need
to reset them again sooner or later. You can accomplish that task in either of
the following two ways:
 Click the Reset button from the Opportunity List.
 Choose Lookup➪Opportunities➪All Opportunities.
Printing the Opportunity List
Now comes the exciting part. Okay, it might not be your exact idea of excite-
ment, but seeing all your hard work translated onto a nice piece of white

I tell you how in Chapter 5.
1. Click Quick Print from the Opportunity List toolbar.
2. From the Print dialog box, click OK.
Viewing Opportunity History
Chapter 8 talks about the nifty histories created by ACT! when you change
certain key pieces of contact information. You create a history for an oppor-
tunity when you create, change the status or stage, generate a quote, or
change the estimated close date. You can view the opportunity history from
the contact’s History tab. If the opportunity is associated with a group or
company, you can view the opportunity from those History tabs as well.
When you customize the eight opportunity user fields in the Opportunity
dialog box, you can also modify them to become History fields so that what-
ever information you put into them is forever recorded on the History tab,
even if you change the content of one of those fields.
Okay, do you want the good news or the bad news? Well, I can’t hear your
response — and don’t you feel silly responding to an inanimate object — so
I’ll give you the bad news first. You might find the histories that ACT! creates
are a bit terse. The good news is that you can edit them as much as you like
by simply double-clicking the history. The Edit History dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 20-8. Edit away to your heart’s content — after all, who said
you couldn’t change history?

Tracking Opportunities
You poor reader, you! You work so hard in filling out the numerous opportu-
nity fields. Knowing that you need a little break, ACT! rewards you with an
abundance of sales reports and charts. Whether you need to report on a
single customer or all your current opportunities, ACT! has a way of giving
you the information.
You can monitor the opportunities that you have at each stage of the sales
development cycle and display this information in a report or graphically in a
sales funnel or sales graph.
Reporting on a single contact
The Opportunities tab provides you with the sales information on any given
contact. The columns on the Opportunities tab work just like the columns in
other ACT! areas, such as the History tab and the Contact List. You can
change their order, sort by any column, and add new columns. You can filter
the list by date and status.
You can use the information contained on the Opportunities tab to create a
quick-and-dirty report in the exact way that you create a report based on the
Contact List. ACT! prints the report in the same exact order as it appears on-
screen — that is, what you see on-screen is what you see on paper. To print a
report on a single opportunity, follow these steps:
1. Go to the contact record of the person for whom you like to track
opportunities.
2. Right-click the Opportunity tab or click the Options button.
You can use a lot of informational fields when you enter a new 
opportunity. You can portray each of these fields as a column on the
Opportunities tab. You can customize the tab in any one of the follow-
ing ways:
• Add a column: Select a field from the Available Fields area and
click the right-pointing arrow.
• Change the order of the columns: Select a field from the Show as
Columns in This Order area and then click the Move Up or Move
Down buttons.
• Remove a column: Select a field from the Show as Columns in This
Order area and click the left-pointing arrow.
3. Click OK when you finish adding columns.

Reporting on all your opportunities
If you feel an overwhelming desire to chop down a few more trees in the rain
forest, ACT! can help. ACT! comes equipped with a dozen opportunity reports
to suit most of your reporting needs. If, for some reason, you don’t find a
report that suits you, at least you look busy when the boss walks by! ACT!
opportunity reports provide details and summaries of opportunities, closed
sales, and lost sales.
The 15 ACT! opportunity reports are
 Totals by Status: Lists all your opportunities subtotaled by Closed/Won
and Lost sales.
 Adjusted for Probability: Lists all your opportunities by contact, sorted
by sales stage. I’m not sure what love — or probabilities — got to do
with it; they don’t affect the report.
 Pipeline: Lists information subtotaled by sales stage; this is a great
accompaniment to the Sales Pipeline graphic.
 Opportunities by Record Manager: Lists information on your opportu-
nities, subtotaled by the Record Manager.
 Opportunities by Contact: Lists opportunities subtotaled by contact.
 Lost Opportunities by Competitor: Subtotals lost opportunities by 
competitor.
 Lost Opportunities by Reason: Subtotals lost opportunities by reason
for losing the sale.
 Lost Opportunities by Record Manager: Subtotals lost opportunities by
the Record Manager.
 Opportunities by Company: Complete information for each company
with an opportunity or a closed sale.
 Opportunities by Group: Subtotals opportunities by group.
 Opportunities Referred By: The report is subtotaled by the opportunity
referral sources.
 Sales by Reason: Opportunities listed by the reason that they’re either
won or lost.
 Opportunity by Status: Report subtotals opportunities based on Open,
Closed, or Inactive status.
 Gross Margin by Product: Subtotals the opportunities by product show-
ing the gross margin.
 Gross Margin by Contact: Subtotals the opportunities by contact show-
ing the gross margin.

Creating an opportunities graph
The opportunities graph can show your sales forecast or your closed sales
for a month, a quarter, or any period of time you choose. Many sales organi-
zations prefer to see sales information in the form of a graph. As usual, ACT!
is up to the task and can create one for you in the blink of an eye — or at
least in the click of the mouse.
Here’s all you need to do to see all your opportunities translated through the
wonder of modern technology into a graph:
1. Create a lookup of contacts to include in the graph.
Need a warm-up on performing lookups? Head to Chapter 7.
2. Choose Reports➪Opportunity Reports➪Opportunity Graph.
The Graph Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-9.
3. On the General tab, indicate the information you to want include in
your graph:
• In the Create Graph For area, select the Current Contact, Current
Lookup, Current Opportunity List, or All Contacts radio button.
• In the Graph area, select the type of opportunities to appear in the
graph.
• Choose the Record Managers of the contacts you’re including in
your graph from the Display Data For area.
• Enter header and footer information to appear on your graph.
• Fill in the date range and intervals in the Dates to Graph area and
values to use in your graph in the Value to Graph area.

whether you want a bar or line graph, the graph size, gridlines, the
colors used in the graph, or the scaling used in your graph (see 
Figure 20-10).
5. Click the Graph button.
Voilà! Your graph appears before your eyes. Try not to look too sur-
prised. If the boss walks by, you might want to make little grunting

Viewing the opportunity pipeline
A picture is worth a thousand words — or in this case, it might be worth thou-
sands of dollars! Most large sales organizations are already familiar with the
concept of a sales pipeline. The ACT! Pipeline graphic represents the number
of opportunities at each stage of the sales development process. Each sec-
tion of an opportunity pipeline represents one of your pre-determined sales
stages. Opportunities that are marked as closed, or those that are missing a
sales stage, are excluded.
1. Perform a lookup to find the contacts that you want to include in the
opportunity pipeline.
Although you don’t have to assign a sales stage to an opportunity, only
opportunities with assigned stages are included in the opportunity
funnel.
2. Choose Reports➪Opportunity Reports➪Opportunity Pipeline.
The Opportunity Pipeline Options dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 20-12. Fill in the pipeline options that you want to use in your
opportunity pipeline:
• Select the contacts you want to include in your pipeline from the
Create Graph For area.
• Select the Record Managers whose data you want to include from
the Display Data for Sales Managed By area.
• Select the process that you want to track.
303

• Color-coordinate your opportunity pipeline by assigning colors to
each of your sales stages in the Assign Colors area. If you want to
change a color, click the ellipsis button to the right of the color and
select another color.
• Fill in the header and footer information that you would like to
include with your pipeline.
3. Click the Graph button.
You are now the proud owner of a beautiful opportunity pipeline (similar
to what’s shown in Figure 20-13), guaranteed to impress the heck out of
your boss and other members of your sales team.

Grouping Your Contacts
In This Chapter
 Understanding groups
 Creating groups
 Establishing group rules
 Putting groups to work
 Utilizing group notes and activities
I
n this chapter, I focus on a very commonly overlooked ACT! feature: the
ACT! group. What exactly is a group? Generally speaking, a group is a col-
lection of something. In ACT!, a group is a collection of contacts. More specif-
ically, a group is a semi-permanent lookup whose contact records you assign
to the group by any criteria that you want.
The contact record helps you to keep track of all activities as they relate to
an individual; the group allows you to track activities as they relate to an
entire group of contacts. So when used correctly, ACT! groups provide you
with the potential to increase the overall power and efficiency of the ACT!
program.
Throughout this chapter, after explaining all the ins and outs of groups, I
show you how to create a group. I then show you how to put groups to work
so that you can enjoy all the benefits that groups have to offer. After reading
this chapter, you’ll become a real group pro — knowing when to use them
(and when not to) and how to use them to their greatest potential.
A Few Good Reasons to Create a Group
You shouldn’t just create groups willy-nilly without putting some thought into
them. If you do that, you’re liable to end up with bad groups, which consume
your time without offering any real benefits. (See the nearby sidebar “Don’t

create bad groups!” to see what I mean.) So what exactly makes a good
group, you ask? Here are a few examples of when groups can really make life
easy for you:
 Managing large projects: Groups are particularly well suited for those of
you who work on large projects. For example, if you’re building a home,
you’re involved with any number of people from building inspectors and
city officials to subcontractors, your own personnel, and the new home-
owner. Assigning all these contacts to a group allows you to easily zero
in on only those contacts involved in the project.
 Tracking real estate listings: If you’re a real estate agent or broker, set-
ting up a group for each listing allows you to track all clients that see a
particular property and to list all properties that you show to a particu-
lar client.
 Organizing your classes and seminars: If you teach classes and semi-
nars, you can set up groups to track all the attendees for each of your
classes. Then, when the time comes, you can print out class lists to
ensure that you contact all class members. You also have a clear listing
as to what classes an individual contact has taken.
 Focusing on a specific group of contacts: Say you went to a trade show
and came back with 75 good, solid leads — all of which you are deter-
mined to call. Your first step is to put all those leads into a group. On
Monday, you might call 20 of those leads, moving each one out of the
group as you make the call. On Tuesday, your list is down to 55 but
maybe you only have the chance to call 5 people. Wednesday finds you
putting out fires around your business and you don’t have a chance to
continue phoning until Friday; you can easily access those remaining 50
contacts and take up right where you left off.
308
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 
Don’t create bad groups!
Here’s an example of a bad group: I once
worked with an ACT! user who had exactly 50
groups — one for each state. He had then sub-
divided each group into subgroups represent-
ing each zip code within the state. This user had
overlooked the obvious — his database already
contained fields for both state and zip code. His
groups provided him with no more information
than he already had — and after he had put all
that time and effort into creating them.
Many ACT! users create groups to track con-
tacts for their newsletter or holiday card mail-
ings. Unfortunately, this situation is another
poor use of a group; although the user sees who
will be receiving the mailing, he doesn’t find out
who is not to receive the mailing. More impor-
tantly, he doesn’t find out who fell through the
cracks and was just overlooked. Setting up a
Mailing field allows you to track all three things.

In previous versions of ACT! you might have relied on groups to track members
of a large company or account. ACT! 2005 introduces the Companies feature,
eliminating the need to use groups to track the companies and/or divisions
that you work with. Best of all, if you’re using groups to track your companies,
you can convert them with a few clicks of your mouse. Chapter 22 shows you
the various ins and outs of this new feature. 
What All Groups Have in Common
In the preceding section, I provide examples of using groups that surely give
you an idea of how you can use groups for a wide range of tasks. Despite the
flexibility of groups, however, all groups share a few common elements:
 Volatility: In general, groups and the contacts within them do not have
to be permanent. A contractor, for example, replaces subcontractors he
works with if they do a poor job. And, after that contractor completes a
house, he might no longer need to use the group that he created for the
project and may choose to delete it. Also, removing a contact from a
group doesn’t in turn remove the contact from the database.
 No limit to the number of groups: You’re allowed to create as many
groups as you want; your only limitation is self-imposed. Working with
thousands of groups, however, is probably rather cumbersome.
 No limit to the number of contacts that belong to a group: However, if
your database appears as though it has taken a tranquilizer every time
you go to the Group Detail window, look at the number of contacts in the
first of your groups.
 No limit to the number of groups a contact can belong to: Depending
on the type of groups that you set up, you might find that a contact
needs to belong to more than one group. For example, if you use groups
to help with project management, you might need to include the same
subcontractor in several groups.
 Relational cross-referencing: By creating a group, you can easily move
between the group as a whole and the individual members within the
group. From the Group Detail window, you can see a list of all the con-
tacts that belong to that group; from the Contacts Detail window, you
can see all the groups that a contact belongs to.
 15 levels of subgroups: You might be working on a huge project that
requires a greater amount of micro-management and consequently more
subgroups. Maybe you’re a realtor and you want to list each neighbor-
hood you work with and then subdivide that into subdivisions and then
subdivide again into individual houses.
309
Chapter 21: Grouping Your Contacts 

Creating a Group
Like most of the other ACT! commands, creating groups is as easy as pie. Just
remember that planning is always the first step: If you work in a shared data-
base, all users need to agree on how to use groups before creating groups
and adding contact records to them.
A group is not meant to be a replacement for the ID/Status field (or any other
existing field for that matter; see the sidebar “Don’t create bad groups!”). The
ID/Status field serves to categorize each contact. For example, you might cat-
egorize each contact as a vendor, customer, or prospect using the ID/Status
field. Limit your groups to help you accomplish something that can’t be done
through the use of fields.
To create a group, simply follow these steps:
1. Display the Group Detail window by clicking the Groups icon on the
Navigation bar.
The Group Detail window should look vaguely familiar — in fact, it’s
nearly identical to the Contact Detail window. Just like the Contact Detail
window, the Group Detail window features tabs along the middle of the
screen. And, just like the Contact Detail window, the Group Detail
window allows you to choose the layout of your choice. As shown in
Figure 21-1, the only differences between the Group and Contact Detail
windows are the list of Subgroups appearing in the Subgroups field and
the Hierarchy field. If you’re creating your very first group, the screen
appears to be blank.
2. Choose Groups➪New Group.
If you prefer, you can right-click in the Group Detail window and choose
New Group. Or, feel free to click the New Group icon on the toolbar. We
aim to please!
A new group appears, which is blank and naked as the day it was born.
3. In the Group field, enter a name for the new group.
When you move to another field, the group list automatically updates
and your group is saved.
4. (Optional) Create a subgroup by selecting the primary group, choos-
ing Groups➪New Subgroup, and then filling in the name of the sub-
group.
You can have as many subgroups per group as you like. And, you can
have up to 15 levels of subgroups; in other words, you can further divide
your subgroups into sub-subgroups. And, after you create a group, you
can go back to the scene of the crime and add a subgroup at any time.

If you prefer, you can also click the Add/Remove Contacts to Group

the Group Detail window and choose Group Membership➪Add/Remove
Contacts. 
In any case, the Contacts dialog box appears (see Figure 21-2).

• Select the All Contacts, Current Lookup, Groups, or Companies
option from the Select From drop-down list.
• Type in the first several letters of the last name of the contact you
want to add to the group in the Look For text box.
• If you want to search by company name, click the Company
column heading in the Contacts to Select From area and then type
the first several letters of the company you want to add to the
group in the Look For text box.
You’ll probably find creating a lookup prior to adding members to a
group easier. By creating the lookup first, you can choose the Current
Lookup option from the Select From drop-down list and then click the
double right-pointing arrows to move all the contacts into your group
with a single click. Need a little help in creating a lookup? Skip back to
Chapter 7.

8. Click OK when you finish adding new contacts to the group.
Need to remove contacts from your group? Use the same procedure you fol-
lowed to add a contact to a group — except that you click the left-pointing
arrow in the Contacts dialog box!
Adding new contacts to a group does not remove existing members of the
group — it just adds additional members.
Updating group membership
After you set up your group and throw a few contacts into it, you can easily
go back to the group to add — or remove — a few members.
1. Choose View➪Group List from any ACT! window.
2. Select the group to which you want to add a query, right-click it, and
then choose Group Membership➪Add/Remove Contacts➪Contacts.

Adding a single member to a group
In addition to adding or removing several contacts at a time to/from your
group, you might want to do it on a contact-by-contact basis. This is easy to
do as well.
1. If necessary, create a lookup for the contact that you want to add to a
group.
2. Click the Contacts icon on the Navigation bar to make sure you are in
the Contact Detail window.
3. Click the Groups/Companies tab.
The Groups/Companies tab is the home to both group and company
information. To make sure that you are viewing group information, make
sure that the Show Membership For drop-down list is displaying Groups
and Subgroups.
4. Click the Add Contact to Group button.
The Add Contact to Groups dialog box opens.
5. Select the group to which you want to add the current contact and
click OK.
Because a contact can belong to more than one group, you can add the
contact to as many groups as you like. The contact’s Groups/Companies
tab displays the groups the contact is a member of.
Setting Up a Group Query Definition
In the preceding sections of this chapter, I show you how using groups in ACT!
is a good thing. I show you how to add and remove contacts to groups. By now,
you’re probably an old group pro, qualified to receive an Official ACT! Groupee
certificate. But, like the best-laid plans of mice and keyboards, there is one
small hitch to your otherwise perfect world. What happens if you forget to add
a contact to a group?
For some of you, forgetting to add a contact to a group isn’t a life-threatening
event. In other circumstances, however, it might be absolutely crucial that all
appropriate contacts are added to the proper group. For example, what if you
send a notification to all members of a group about an important meeting,
but the CEO isn’t included in the group?
Step away from the aspirin — this problem is easily licked with the simple
creation of a group definition query. A definition query is ACT!’s way of auto-
matically adding contacts to a group based on information in specific fields.
Your group rules can be as simple as adding all contacts created by Joe Blow

to the Joe Blow Group, or they can be based on much more complex criteria,
such as “All customers in the Southwest region managed by Joe, Sue, or Steve
belong in the Widgets Group.”
A query runs every time you’re looking at the Group Detail window. You
create a query based on specific field values. For example, you might set up a
group rule to find all the prospects in New York for whom Mike is the sales
rep; base your rule on the ID/Status, State, and Record Manager fields.
To set up a group definition query, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Group List from any ACT! window.
2. Select the group to which you want to add a query, right-click it, and
then choose Group Membership➪Add/Remove Contacts➪Edit
Criteria.
The opening screen of the Group Criteria dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 21-3.
3. Fill in the criteria to use to establish group membership.
• Type: You can query on either Contact or Opportunity fields.
• Field Name: All the fields in your database are included in the
Contact or Opportunity field drop-down lists. Select the field that
determines the membership into your group depending on the
type you selected.
• Operator: Pick an operator from the drop-down list. The choices
are fairly self-explanatory with options like Equals, Contains, and
Ends With. It might even make you feel like you’re playing charades!
• Value: Type in the field value you’re looking to match. If you select
the State field name, the value might be FL.

4. Click the Add to List button.
Your entry now appears in the table portion of the Group Criteria dialog
box, and ACT! is ready and waiting for you to add another criterion.
5. Repeat the process until you select all the values.
For example, if you want the contact record to be in one of a series of
states and have an ID/Status of Customer, you can add a second condition.
6. Change the And/Or indicator as needed.
By default, ACT! inserts an And in the And/Or column. That means that a
contact must match both criteria in order to become a member of the
group. In Figure 21-3, I changed the value to Or indicating that I was
searching for either Customers or Prospects.
If you add a second condition, the contact must match both conditions,
not one or the other. For example, if you specify values for both the City
and ID/Status fields, all members of the group have to reside in the same
city and have identical ID/Status. The only way to avoid this scenario is
to change the And/Or value to Or.
7. Click the Preview button.
After a few seconds of contemplation, ACT! presents you with a list of
the contacts that match your criteria.
8. Click OK.
If you take a look at the Group Detail window Contacts tab, you’ll notice
that all of the contacts that appeared in the preview are now members of
the group. And those contacts that didn’t meet the specifications were
sent out in the cold — or at least removed from the group.
Working with Groups
You can customize groups in the same exact way that you can customize the
Contact Detail window. You can add new fields, change the layout, and add
tabs. You can even do a special Group lookup to search for a group based on
the information in any one of the group fields that you’ve created. For a crash
course in adding new fields, scurry to Chapter 15. For a refresher course in
customizing layouts, scamper over to Chapter 16.
After you create a group and stick a few unsuspecting contacts into it, things
really get exciting. I love to use the phrase “unleash the power of ACT!” — I
have this vision of Mr. Clean roaring out of my monitor. Okay, maybe I need to
get a life, but I feel that by correctly using groups, you can really get a lot of
bang for your buck with the ACT! program. This is how you can fool ACT! into
believing it’s a relational database. Try not to let too many people in on the
secret — it might just raise the price of the software.

Chapter 21: Grouping Your Contacts 

Think of your groups as a program within a program. You have nearly the same
functionality that you do with the contact portion of ACT! — with one big dif-
ference: The activities you create while in the Group Detail window affect the
entire group. After you set up a group, you can add group notes, histories,
activities, and opportunities for the group in exactly the same way you set
them up for a contact. You can even attach a group-specific file to the group
Documents tab. This is a great timesaver because information that you input
belongs to the group and doesn’t have to be duplicated on the contact level.
Using groups to schedule activities
One of the most powerful aspects of ACT! is its ability to associate a contact
with an activity. (See Chapter 9 to read more about activities in ACT!.) Many
scheduling programs allow you to design beautiful calendars; the problem is
that these calendars aren’t tied to a particular contact record. For example, 
if you schedule an appointment to visit Jane Smith and forget the date of the
appointment, your only recourse is to flip through your calendar until you find
the appointment. After you met with Jane, you have no history of the appoint-
ment unless you once again search through your previous appointments.
To take this analogy one step further, suppose that you chair a special com-
mittee for your local Chamber of Commerce and need to schedule a meeting.
Scheduling the same appointment with each of the twenty-odd participants is
very time consuming. Trying to fit each committee member’s name on your
calendar isn’t very practical either. By scheduling the meeting with the
group, however, you achieve your goal without the hassle.
Here’s how it works:
1. Click the Groups icon on the Navigation bar.
2. Click the Group List button on the toolbar and select the group with
which you want to schedule a meeting by double-clicking it.
3. Click the Schedule Meeting icon on the toolbar.
The Schedule Activity dialog box pops open (see Figure 21-4). The name
of the group that you select magically appears in the Associate With
field.
4. Click the Contacts button to the right of the Schedule With field and
then click Select Contacts.
Here’s where you can add any individual contacts that you might want
to include in your meeting. When you schedule an activity with a group,
the activity appears on each and every contact’s individual Activities
tabs.
5. Click OK to close the Contacts dialog box and OK again to close the
Schedule Activity dialog box.
316
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

6. Flip over to the Group Detail window by clicking the Groups icon on
the Navigation bar.
Okay, I know I get overly excited about the little things in life, but to me
this is way cool. You’ll notice from Figure 21-5 that when you schedule
an activity with an entire group, our friend the hyperlink shows up in the
Schedule With column. By clicking the word “multiple” — which shows
up when you schedule a group activity — you’re sent to the Contact List
where you’re rewarded with all the contacts invited to the festivities. Or,
if you prefer, look on the Activities tab of any of the individual attendees;
once again, you’ll notice that “multiple” appears in the Scheduled With
column; click it to return to the Contact List to see the list of attendees.
Using notes with groups
You can create a note and assign it to a specific group in three different ways.
I describe each of these ways in the following subsections.
Entering a note directly from the Group Detail window
By far the easiest way to enter a Group note is via the Group Detail window.
All you need to do is
1. Choose View➪Group List from any of the ACT! windows.
2. Select the name of the group for which you want to enter a note and
give it a double-click.
3. On the Notes tab, click the Insert Note icon.
Figure 21-4:

Chapter 21: Grouping Your Contacts 

Entering a note from the Contact Detail 
window and assigning it to the group
You can also add a group note using the Contact Detail window as your start-
ing point. The drill is just about the same as for adding a regular note, with
one extra step.
1. From the Contact Detail window, create a lookup for the contact
record of the group member for whom you want to create a new note.
Scratching your head as to how you’re going to find that contact? You
find the answers to all your lookup questions in Chapter 7.
2. On the Notes tab, click the Insert Note icon.
The Insert Note window pops open. If you want to see a real live picture
of this window stroll over to Chapter 8 for a better look. To edit an exist-
ing note, give the note a double-click.
3. Click the Ellipsis button in the Associate With area.
For those of you who might not be acquainted with an ellipsis, it’s the
button decorated with the three little dots.
4. Select the appropriate group name, click the right-pointing arrow, and
then click OK.

Creating a group history
Another method of adding a group note is slightly more complicated than 
the other methods. So why, you might be wondering, am I including this in a
For Dummies book? The reason is that you might find yourself in a situation
where you need to designate a note as belonging to a group after you created
it. Besides, by now you know that nothing in ACT! is hard once you learn the
trick. Here’s how you do it:
1. Choose View➪Group List to see a list of all your groups.
2. Select the group you want, give it a right-click, and select Create
Lookup.
3. From the Contact List that appears, click the Tag All button.
4. Press Ctrl+H.
The Record History window opens. You can see what it looks like in
Figure 21-6.
5. Fill in your information, making sure that you include the group name
in the Associate With field. 
ACT! grabs a pen and paper and starts jotting that note down for all of
the contacts in your group. Well, maybe no pen is involved but you get
the idea!

Chapter 22
Joining a Company
In This Chapter
 Discovering companies
 Navigating the corporate maze of divisions
 Creating companies
 Working with companies
T
he first portion of this book focused mainly on the contact aspect of
ACT!; after all, ACT! is considered to be a “contact manager.” In Chapter 21,
you can find out about groups, which, as the name implies, allows you to
group your contacts into more manageable-sized pieces. The company por-
tion of ACT! is new in version 2005 and quite frankly not all of you are going
to take advantage of this feature. However, those of you who are working with
larger companies and organizations will find this feature invaluable.
In this chapter, I lead you through setting up a company and, if necessary, a
division. I show you how to add (or remove) members of a company and how
to use the various company features. You even find out about the company
reports before all is said and done.
The 411 on Companies
Face it: Bureaucracy is alive and well and living in most civilized countries.
Actually, it probably lives in uncivilized ones as well. Your database might
contain the names of the head guy (also know as The Decision Maker), your
main point of contact, the guy who signs the checks, and the person who
actually does all the work (the Administrative Assistant). Seems easy at first
until the head guy gets fired, the check signer takes off for Brazil — and new
people replace both of them.
In really large companies (generally those that have their own cafeteria and a
lot of cubicles), various divisions within the company often compound this
hierarchy. Fortunately, ACT! can accommodate your need to track contacts,
companies, and even divisions.

Just like navigating your way around a maze of cubicles can be intimidating,
you might be a little hesitant about learning yet another piece of the software
puzzle. Relax! A lot of similarities exist between the contact and company
portions of ACT!; you can apply most of the concepts that you know about
contacts to companies as well. For example,
 You can add your own unique company fields and associated drop-down
lists (see Chapter 15).
 Companies come with a variety of modifiable layouts (see Chapter 16).
 You can add company specific documents, notes, activities, and oppor-
tunities (see Chapters 5, 8, 9, and 20).
 ACT! provides you with various customizable company specific reports
(see Chapters 11 and 12).
 You can view, modify, and print a list of all your companies.
 You can create company-based lookups (see Chapter 7).
 You can create a mail merge to a specific company (see Chapter 13).
Hey Dude, Where’s My Company?
Just like with contacts and groups, ACT! provides you with a whole series of
windows that help you manage your companies. Although most of these win-
dows parallel the contact and group windows, you’ll soon see that the cor-
rect usage of companies can transform ACT! into a highly effective relational
database. Although you might find navigating this maze of windows a bit con-
fusing, read on and you’ll soon navigate around your companies like a sea-
soned veteran.
Hyperlinks
The company feature you’ll probably like the best is the ability to quickly flip
back and forth between a company and the contacts that “belong” to that com-
pany. This is done through a series of hyperlinks. When you indicate that a 
contact is associated with a company, the company name turns to blue; click 
it and you arrive at the Company Detail window. From the Company Detail
window, you see a series of tabs running across the middle of the screen. Click
the Contacts tab, and you see a list of the contacts associated with the com-
pany. Guess what? All the contact names appear in blue. At first, you might
think that this feature is just decorative, but if you venture forth and click a
contact name, you’ll find that the hyperlink returns you safely to the Contact
Detail window of the contact you clicked.
322
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

If you’re really feeling adventurous, click the company hyperlink one more
time. When you see the list of company contacts, click a different contact and,
voilà, you land on that contact’s contact record. Even though you’ll probably
find “hyperclicking” back and forth between the company and its contacts
lots of fun, read on to find out even more about companies.
The Companies tab
Sorry to disappoint you, but in ACT! the Companies tab doesn’t refer to 
the boss’s decision to pick up the check for Friday night’s beer bash! The
Companies tab actually refers to one part of the Groups/Companies tab in 
the Contact Detail window. When you click the tab, you have a choice of
seeing the membership information for either the groups or the companies
that a contact is associated with. The Company List works in much the same
way in that it flips you back and forth between your groups and companies;
guess you can consider that you’re getting two tabs for the price of one!
In ACT!, you can link each contact only to a single company. The Companies
tab works a bit differently because a single contact can be a member of multi-
ple companies. Sound confusing? Think about it. I am linked to Tech Benders
because that is the name of my company. But what if I were a sales rep and
assigned to several companies, all of which I like to cross-reference on my con-
tact page? Or what if you have a contractor in your database who works with
more than one company? Enter the Companies tab, as shown in Figure 22-1.
The Company List
The Company Detail and Contact Detail windows are two ways you can see
company information as it pertains to the individual contact. The Company
List lets you view a list of all the companies that you have previously created.
Like with all lists, you can change the sorting order, add or remove columns,
filter the information, and print the list; feel free to review Chapter 5 if you
need a refresher course in how to do any of that.
Figure 22-1:

Chapter 22: Joining a Company

You can access the Company List in a number of ways (see Figure 22-2):
 Choose View➪Company List from any of the ACT! screens.
 Click the Company icon on the Navigation bar and then click the Company
List button.
 Create a Company lookup by choosing Lookup➪Companies➪All
Companies. If you create a lookup based on any of the individual com-
pany fields, the resulting Company List includes only those companies
that matched your search criteria.
In addition to allowing you to see a list of all your companies, the Company
List allows you to accomplish various company chores, all of which you can
access by right-clicking your way to the shortcut menu. As you can see from
the shortcut menu in Figure 22-3, your options include
 Creating or deleting companies and divisions
 Creating a lookup on any of the company fields
 Attaching notes, histories, and attachments to a company
 Moving that entails demoting a company to division or promoting a divi-
sion to a separate company
 Adding or removing members from a company

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

After you arrive at the Company List, you might find that your visit is some-
what short-lived because you want to zoom in on one of the companies for
more details. Not a problem — just double-click the company you want to
focus on, and you’re transported lickety-split to the Company Detail window.
Knowing the juicy company details
The Company Detail window has many of the same features as the Contact
Detail window, such as its own definable fields and layouts, and tabs for
adding or removing contacts as members, inserting or viewing notes, histo-
ries, activities, and opportunities.
You create and manage companies in the Company Detail window. Not sure
how to get there? Just click the Companies icon on the Navigation bar. If you
look at Figure 22-4, the Company Detail window looks almost exactly like the
Contact Detail window.
Because the Company Detail window is so similar to the Contact Detail
window, you may find yourself wandering dazed and confused into the wrong
window by mistake. You might think you are entering new contacts, contact
details, or contact notes when you are actually entering new companies, com-
pany details, and company notes. Just as checking the title bar to assure that
you are in the correct database is important, remember to sneak a peak at
the Back and Forward bar to make sure you’re in the correct view. Believe
me, the only thing worse than entering lots and lots of data is deleting it all —
and then starting all over again!
At first glance, the Company Detail window looks like a clone of the Contact
Detail window. A couple of major differences, however, are
 Division and Hierarchy fields: You can subdivide companies subdi-
vided into divisions; the Division field allows you to see all the divisions
within a company. You can zoom into a division by double-clicking it.
The Hierarchy field in Figure 22-4 indicates that you are viewing a divi-
sion; clicking the Up button returns you to the main company.

Chapter 22: Joining a Company

 The Contacts tab: There is a certain symmetry here. In the Contact Detail
window, you have a Groups/Companies tab; and in the Company Detail
window, you have a Contacts tab. The neat thing about the Contacts tab
is that you can zoom to any individual contact by clicking the hyperlink
attached to the name.
Company Housekeeping
The Company portion of ACT! is at the same time both surprisingly powerful
and surprisingly easy to use. Like anything else in life, your companies func-
tion best when you give a little thought to their care and feeding. Here are a
few of the routine tasks you need to know about.
Forming a new company
When you create a company in real life, you have to hire an attorney and sign
a bunch of papers. In ACT! the procedure is a bit simpler, thank heavens! You
Figure 22-4:
The Com-
pany Detail
window.
326
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

can add a new company from either the Company List or Company Detail
window.
1. Click the New Company icon on the toolbar of the Company Detail
window or the Company List.
A blank Company Detail window appears.
Adding a new company works in pretty much the same way as adding a
contact. When that blank screen appears, you are the proud owner of a
new, albeit blank, company. You need to start entering in some informa-
tion. If you clicked the New Company icon by accident, you’ll need to
delete the company.
2. Fill all the necessary information into the various company fields.
3. Click the Contacts tab, click the Add/Remove Contacts button, and
then click the Contacts button in the Add/Remove Contacts dialog box. 
Whew! I agree, that seems like a lot of steps, but you safely arrive at your
destination, which in this case is the Contacts dialog box, as illustrated
in Figure 22-5. Type in the first several letters of the last name of the con-
tact you want to associate with this company.
4. Click the right-pointing arrow.
You may add as many names as you like to the company.
5. Click OK when you finish.

Chapter 22: Joining a Company

Creating a division
You might find yourself dealing with companies that vary in size from the
sole proprietor who runs his business from his backyard tree house to the
Fortune 500 company with locations all around North America — or the world
for that matter. You might even find yourself working with a really super-sized
corporation — like the federal government. ACT! allows you to create 15 divi-
sion levels so you can have divisions of your divisions of your divisions. Sound
confusing? It is, but then so is the structure of many mega corporations. 
The Company Detail window is probably your best source for navigating
through the corporate maze. If you are looking at the main company window,
you’ll notice all the divisions listed in the Divisions field along the right side
(refer to Figure 22-4). If you want to home in on a division, just double-click the
division name; the company name and path now appear in the Hierarchy field
and additional subdivisions appear in the Divisions field. You can keep drilling
down through the divisions until you reach the final subdivision or oil —
whichever comes first.
To create a new division, subdivision, sub-subdivision, or whatever, follow
these steps:
1. Display the company to which you want to add a division.
2. Click the New Division icon on the toolbar.
You right-clickers in the crowd can also right-click and choose New
Division from the shortcut menu. Either way, a blank Company Detail
window appears.
3. Enter the pertinent info for the division that you are creating.
The next time you display the original company, you see the division
you added in the Divisions field. Double-click it and you land in the new
division. To add members to the division, click the Add/Remove
Contacts button on the Contacts tab and add division members just like
you add company members.
Deleting a company
I almost hesitate to tell you this one because you could easily delete a com-
pany by accident. The good news is that even if you delete a company, the
contacts associated with the company are still alive and well and living in
your database. The bad news is that all the information from the company
fields is lost forever — unless, of course, you have a backup!
1. Select the company you want to delete in one of the following ways:
• Highlight the company from the Company List. 
328
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

• View the company from the Company Detail window.
2. Right-click and select Delete Company.
3. Click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the selected company.
Converting a group to a company
You might already be an ACT! fanatic and have recently converted from
ACT! 6 to ACT! 2005. ACT! 6 users had to be content with groups because the
concept of companies was non-existent at that time. You might have set up a
group that in actuality is a company. New users in the crowd might set up a
group from time to time and find that the group miraculously transformed
itself into a full-scale company. By now, you know that ACT! thinks of every-
thing, and this is just one more instance. You can easily convert a group into
a company at the click (or two) of a button by following these steps:
1. From any ACT! screen, choose View➪Group List.
2. From the Group List, select the group you want to convert to a company.
3. Right-click and select Convert to Company.
If you prefer, you can also head up to the menu bar and choose Group➪
Convert to Company. In any case, the Convert Groups to Companies
Wizard appears.
4. Continue clicking Next until you arrive at the last screen; then click
Finish.
If you like, I can try to make these instructions a bit more difficult.
Basically the wizard is confirming that yes, you want to convert the
group into a company. By default, the group name becomes the com-
pany name; the group address now is the company address and so on.
Feel free to muddle in there if you want, but don’t blame me if your mud-
dling efforts are successful!
After the conversion is complete, you might want to race over to the
Company List to have a look at the company you just worked so hard to
create! You’ll also notice that the original group has disappeared — or at
least been replaced by the new company.
Following the company rules
Nothing is worse than letting things “slip through the cracks,” and ACT!
works like a demon to prevent this from happening. Companies are only as
good as the contacts associated with them — so what happens when you
forget to link a contact to a company? Never fear, once again ACT! is here
329
Chapter 22: Joining a Company

with a solution. Setting up company rules helps automate the process. That
way, whenever you add a new contact to an existing company, it is automati-
cally linked to that company.
To set up a company rule, follow these steps:
1. Right-click from either the Company List or the Company Detail
window and choose Company Membership➪Add or Remove
Contacts➪Edit Criteria.
The Company Criteria dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-6, opens.
2. Indicate the criteria that you’re using to determine how the new con-
tacts are automatically linked to an existing company.
Nine times out of ten, you base the criteria on the company name so you
fill in your criteria exactly as you see it in Figure 22-6. If you’re working
with a large company with multiple offices, you might need to indicate
the city as well. For those of you who always prefer multiple choice to
fill-in-the-blank exams, you can choose all the values from drop-down
lists so that you can simply select the criteria you want:
• Type: Indicate that you want to match a Contact or an Opportunity
field.
• Field Name: Indicate the field you want to use.
• Operator: Typically, you use something like Equal To or Contains.
• Value: Indicate the name of the company or the exact verbiage you
want to match.
3. Click the Add to List button.
Figure 22-6:

330
Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

In general, you only add one criterion — the company’s name. However,
if you need to have more than one criterion, go ahead and add as many
as you like. The criteria you select display in the center pane.
4. Click the Preview button to preview the contacts linked to the company.
5. Click OK when you finish.
The next time you add a new contact and indicate that he works at an
old company — or at least one of your existing ones — ACT! automati-
cally links the contact to the company.
Joining the Company Association
The beginning of this chapter concentrates on the company side of things;
you can read how to create a company and associate contacts with that com-
pany. This section looks at the individual contact and his association with a
company. As I mention earlier, there are two ways that a contact can be asso-
ciated with a company: through the use of a hyperlink in the contact’s com-
pany field, and by association with a company or companies on the contact’s
Groups/Companies tab.
A contact can be linked to only one company. However a contact can be a
member of more than one company.
Linking a contact to a company
You have two important concepts to remember before linking a contact to a
company:
 You can link a contact to only one company.
 Linking a contact to a company creates a hyperlink from the contact to
the corresponding company.
Sound a bit confusing? It is, but here’s a way to simplify things. Linking a con-
tact to a company is done using the company field on the Contact Detail
window. In general, the contact will be linked to his own company.
Now with those concepts in hand, follow these steps to link a contact to a
company:
1. Create a lookup of the contact that you want to link back to a company.
2. Click the Browse button (with the ellipsis) next to the Company field
in the Contact Detail window.
The Link to Company dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 22-7.
331
Chapter 22: Joining a Company

3. Select the company to which you want to link the contact and then
click OK.
The company name now appears in blue, indicating that a hyperlink is
created between the contact and the company.
If you find that you no longer want the link, simply click the Browse button
again. ACT! asks you whether it’s okay to disable the link. Click OK, and it’s
history.
Adding or removing company members
Just because a contact is linked to a company doesn’t mean that he is a
member of that company. I know this seems like fuzzy logic, but this concept
ties in to the fact that a contact can be linked to only one company but can
be a member of several. You saw earlier in this chapter how you could associ-
ate a contact with a company from the Company Detail window. Now you can
see how to associate an individual contact to one or more companies from
the Contact Detail window.
Don’t worry — gaining membership to a company is easy and doesn’t require
a membership application or initiation fee. You can add new members to the
club, er, company from either the Company Detail or the Contact Detail win-
dows. Start with an individual contact and sign him up as a member of the
company:
1. Create a lookup on the contact that you want to add as a member to
the company.
2. Click the Groups/Companies tab and show membership for
Companies and Divisions.
Figure 22-7:

Part V: Commonly Overlooked ACT! Features 

You’ll probably find that last step a bit unnecessary; I do, too. Just
remember that Groups and Companies are forced to share the same tab
so you have to specify that you are interested in using the Company por-
tion of the tab.
3. Click the Add Contacts to Company button.
The Link to Company window shows up, as shown in Figure 22-7.
4. Select the company you wish to link to the current contact and then
click OK.
After you set up a link from the contact to the company, you can also do it
from the Company side in pretty much the same way. You might want to add
several contacts to the company at once, so now’s your opportunity.
1. Create a lookup on the company to which you want to add additional
members and click the Contacts tab.
2. Click the Add/Remove Contacts button.
The Contacts dialog box appears (refer to Figure 22-5).
• To add a contact: Select a contact from the list on the left and then
click the right arrow to move the contact to the Selected Contacts
list.
• To add all the contacts from the current lookup: Click the double
right-pointing arrow button.
• To remove a contact: Select a contact from the Selected Contacts
list, and then click the left arrow to move the contact to the
Contact to Select From list.
• To remove all the contacts: Click the double left-pointing arrow
button.
3. Continue adding or removing contacts.
Feel free to add as many contacts to a company as you like.
4. Click OK when you finish.
The members of the company now appear on the Contacts tab of the
Company Detail window. Feel free to rearrange that tab in any way that you
like; if you need help doing that, refer back to Chapter 5.
Working with a Company
You might want to think of a company as a mini “database within a database.”
The Company Detail window includes the same tabs as other views do —
Notes, History, Activities, Opportunities, and Documents. However, it has one
333
Chapter 22: Joining a Company

major difference: You can filter the Notes, History, Activities, and Opportunities
tabs to show just the information that pertains directly to the contact. This fea-
ture is very useful and powerful and gives ACT! a whole new dimension.
Jotting down a company note
The concept of company notes is a powerful but confusing one. You might have
12 contacts, all associated with one company. Assume each of those contacts
has an average of 20 notes that you’ve entered. If my math is correct — and it
doesn’t hurt to double-check me here — the combined total notes for all the
company members is 240. Now imagine having to sift through all those notes
looking for the one important one. Yikes! That might take a while. Conversely,
imagine your company just closed a major deal with the other company; you’d
probably find having to enter the same note 20 times, once for each member of
the company, repetitious and a huge waste of your time. Enter the company
note.
Entering a note from the Company Detail window solves both of these dilem-
mas: You don’t have to enter the note repeatedly and you don’t have to
search through a mountain of notes to find it.
Entering a company note is as easy as one, two, three:
1. Click the Notes tab in the Company Detail window.
2. Click the Insert Note button.
3. Fill in the details of the note and click OK.
Now comes the fun part. If you look at Figure 22-8, you’ll notice the Show For
drop-down list. Here’s where you can filter the notes to show only company
specific notes. You have three choices from which to choose:
 All: Shows both company-specific and contact-specific notes.
 Company: Shows only company-specific notes.
 Company Contacts: Shows only contact-specific notes.
When you enter a note from the Company Detail window, you can only access
it from the Company Detail window. If you enter a note from the Contact
Detail window of a company member, you can view the note from both the
Contact Detail and Company Detail windows.

Associating a note, history, activity, 
or opportunity with a company
The final piece of the company puzzle occurs when you want to create a note,
history, activity, or opportunity with a specific member of a company and you
want to make sure that it’s easily accessible from the Company Detail window.
And, of course, you don’t want to have to plow through numerous items just to
find the specific note, history, activity, or opportunity that you’re looking for. If
you were dealing with another Contact Management program, I might just tell
you to take a hike; but you’re dealing with ACT!, so of course I have a solution
for you.
Actually, the solution is a pretty easy one. Any time you create a note, his-
tory, activity, or opportunity, ACT! allows you to associate it with a company.
By doing that, you take advantage of the Company filter on the appropriate
Groups/Companies tab so that you can just view the pertinent information
that you want. I show you how to do it for an opportunity, but you can use
the same methodology when creating a note, history, or activity.
1. Create a lookup for the contact with whom you want to create a sales
opportunity.
2. Click the Opportunities tab and then click the New Opportunity icon.

3. Click the Ellipsis button next to the Associate With field.
The Associate with Group/Company dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 22-9.
4. Select the Companies/Divisions tab.
5. Locate the company or division from the list on the left, and click the
right-pointing arrow to select it.
The company name now appears in the Associate With list.
6. Click OK.
After you associate a note, history, activity, or opportunity with a company,
you can view them from the Company Detail window. Filter the History,
Activities, and Opportunities tabs exactly the same way as the Notes tab 
by clicking the Show For drop-down list and selecting your desired filtering
option. And, when you quickly find just the item you’re looking for in the fil-
tered list, think of me before heading out to the pool!
Accessing the company files
Unlike the other systems tabs, you can’t filter the Documents tab. Rather, it
sits there like a giant bank vault, just waiting for your deposit. Okay, maybe
all this talk about companies has left me with dreams of Monopoly, but you
can attach as many documents as you like to the Documents tab of the
Company Detail window. This saves you having to hunt through the various
company contacts looking for the contact to whom you attached an impor-
tant file.

Getting the Company Reports
Although ACT! might not be submitting reports to the SEC for you, at times, it
seems like it comes pretty darned close. ACT! comes out of the box with five
reports, all of which you can clone and customize to fit your needs. If you
haven’t done so already, you may customize your reports in Chapter 12.
 Company Membership: Lists all your companies and their members.
 Company Summary: Shows the notes, histories, activities, and opportu-
nities for all companies.
 Company Comprehensive: Gives you the complete lowdown on a com-
pany. It includes all field information as well as notes, histories, activi-
ties, and opportunities.
 Company List: Provides you with a list of all your companies including
the description, phone, and toll-free numbers.
 Company Directory: Lists the regular and shipping addresses, and
phone and toll-free numbers for each of your companies.

tures that ACT! 2005 offers.

Ten Differences between ACT!
2005 and ACT! 2005 Premium
In This Chapter
 Bigger is better
 More contact security
 Multi-user and resource scheduling
 Synchronization differences
 Purchasing information
B
y now you know about all the neat features in ACT!. Your head is proba-
bly spinning and you’re feeling like you just can’t cram one more piece
of information into your addled brain. But wait — there’s more! So far, this
book has concentrated on ACT! 2005. However, a great universe of ACT! users
are part of larger office environments who have been hankering for a larger
solution for their contact management needs. Ta-dum (drumrolls, please) —
here it is! As I mention throughout this book, ACT! 2005 has a big brother
product — its name is ACT! 2005 Premium. In this chapter, I list the differ-
ences between the two products.
ACT! 2005 Premium includes all the features of ACT! 2005 . . . and then some.
Sharing Databases between 
the Two Versions
Realizing that the two versions of ACT! represent totally different products is
important. You can’t install ACT! 2005 and ACT! 2005 Premium on the same
machine; to upgrade to ACT! 2005 Premium, you have to uninstall ACT! 2005
before installing ACT! 2005 Premium. You also need to register the product.

If you have multiple users on your network, they must all be using the same
version of ACT!; ACT! 2005 can’t read ACT! 2005 Premium information and
vice versa. You also can’t synchronize information between the two versions.
You can easily convert ACT! 2005 databases to the ACT! Premium format.
However, ACT! 2005 cannot open or convert ACT! Premium databases, though
the Premium version does allow you to save a database in the 2005 format.
SQL Versions
SQL is the language that is used to create the latest versions of ACT!. This is a
good thing because it makes ACT! much more robust than previous versions:
Your database now supports more users, contacts, and fields. It’s also good
because developers can develop products that integrate with ACT!.
If you want to appear to be particularly knowledgeable at the next cocktail
party, you’ll want to throw around the word SQL a few times — and realize
that it doesn’t apply to the latest Oprah selection. SQL is the abbreviation for
structured query language. In order to avoid embarrassment, pronounce it as
either SEE-kwell or S-Q-L.
ACT! 2005 automatically installs the Microsoft Desktop Edition (MSDE) of SQL
on your computer. The installation CD includes the MSDE version of SQL.
Depending on your operating system, ACT! 2005 Premium installs either the
MSDE or the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition. If you are using
Windows XP Home, XP Professional, or 2000 Professional, ACT! 2005 Premium
automatically installs the MSDE version of SQL on your computer. Microsoft
SQL Server 2000 Standard Edition is installed if ACT! 2005 Premium detects
that you are running Windows 2000 Server, 2000 Advanced Server, or Server
2003. The full-blown version of SQL is included with your ACT! 2005 Premium
purchase; however, because this version of SQL is so large, you receive a
second CD that you’re prompted to install.
You can’t specify which version of SQL you want to install on your computer.
ACT! automatically installs either the MSDE or Server Standard Edition based
on your operating system.
You might be thinking that because you already own SQL licenses you don’t
have to purchase additional licenses. Because ACT! 2005 Premium comes
packaged with its own OEM version of SQL, you must still pay the full price
for the software. The ACT! versions of SQL are read-only; you can export
information out of the SQL tables, but you can’t change the structure of those
tables.
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

System Requirements
The minimum system requirements for ACT! 2005 and ACT! 2005 Premium
running the MSDE version of SQL are exactly the same:
 A Pentium III-or-higher processor
 512MB RAM
 A hard drive with 300MB of available space
 The Windows XP, 2000, or Server 2003 operating system
 A CD-ROM drive
 SMTP/POP3, Outlook, Outlook Express 5.5 or higher, or Eudora 5.2 or
higher as e-mail
 Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher
When you move up to running ACT! 2005 with Microsoft SQL Server 2000, you
need to bump your system up slightly to include
 A hard drive with 350MB of available space
 Windows 2000 or 2003 Server as your operating system
These system requirements are the minimum necessary to run either version
of ACT! 2005. In this case more is, well, more! Don’t be afraid to double up on
your RAM memory — you can never have too much of a good thing.
Scalability
Scalability is a popular buzzword that refers to how well a hardware or soft-
ware system can adapt to increased demands. For example, a scalable net-
work system is one that starts with just a few workstations but can easily
expand to thousands. Scalability can be a very important feature because it
means that you can invest in a system confident that you won’t outgrow it.
ACT! 2005 has a size limitation of 2GB per database. As your database
approaches that size — and believe me, I’m talking about one huge database —
you’ll probably experience a decrease in performance. ACT! 2005 Premium is
a more scalable database; it does not have any size limitations.
343
Chapter 23: Ten Differences between ACT! 2005 and ACT! 2005 Premium 

Number of Users
Ten is the magic number. If you currently have ten named users in your ACT!
database, you can use ACT! 2005. This restriction is very specific. You can’t,
for example, have 20 users in your database and just let 10 of them use your
database at one time; ACT! 2005 actually restricts the number of users that
you can add to your database.
One way to limit the number of users in your database is to make users who
are no longer accessing your database inactive. Make any users inactive who
never access your database or who left the company. Chapter 3 tells you how
to designate a user as inactive.
ACT! 2005 Premium lets you have over 10 users accessing your database. In
fact, you can have 100 if you like. Because of ACT! 2005 Premium’s scalability,
it doesn’t have a hard and fast limit on the number of users. However, the
developers recommend that you limit yourself to 100 concurrent users.
Limited Access Contacts and Teams
In ACT! 2005, the only way you can limit access to a contact record is by des-
ignating it as private; the Record Manager can only view private records.
ACT! 2005 Premium takes the issue of security one step further by adding 
a third level of contact access — limited access. Database Managers and
Administrators can allow users to access these limited access contacts 
on a contact-by-contact basis.
In addition to designating a contact as having limited access, ACT! 2005
Premium also introduces the concept of teams. Teams are basically groups of
users; Managers and Administrators can assign limited access contacts and
resources to teams in order to grant access to several users all at the same
time.
Group Invitations and Scheduling
ACT! 2005 Premium includes the ability to send formal invitations to activities
out to the other members of your organization. Don’t get too excited — these
invitations are not engraved on vellum but arrive in the shape of an e-mail. If
you are the proud recipient of one of these invitations you have the option to
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

accept, tentatively accept, or decline the invitation. After you make that life-
shattering decision, two things happen: A notice goes out to the person who
sent you the invitation informing them of your decision and, if you accepted
the invitation, ACT! automatically adds it to your calendar.
Scheduling Resources
Imagine working in a large company and scheduling a meeting with several of
your largest prospects only to find that someone else was using the confer-
ence room. Or what would happen if you were scheduled to travel across the
country to give a presentation — and the LCD projector was nowhere to be
found? ACT! 2005 Premium considers items, such as conference rooms and
audio/visual equipment, as resources. More importantly, you can check the
availability of these resources exactly like you can check the availability of a
co-worker. This doesn’t sound like a big deal — until you hold your next
meeting in the hall closet because someone else had boogied into the confer-
ence room ahead of you!
Synchronization
In ACT! 2005, you can only synchronize to another database if the master
database is open. Not so with ACT! 2005 Premium; an independent sync ser-
vice sits around waiting for the syncs to appear even if ACT! isn’t open.
ACT! 2005 can only synchronize through a separate service, such as VPN or
Terminal Services. Although ACT! 2005 Premium can also make use of those
services to sync, you can also configure it to work via an IIS Service.
Pricing and Availability
ACT! 2005 is available for purchase at literally all software and office supply
stores as well as on most Internet sites that sell software. ACT! 2005 Premium
is available only through volume licensing. That means you can’t cruise over
to your local Software ’R Us store and pick up a copy; ACT! 2005 Premium is
available only through special volume license distribution channels. Volume
licensing is available to users needing ten or more seats of ACT!. The good
news is that you can order just the number of licenses that you need for your
business. Need 18 seats of ACT!? No problem. Need 18 and a half? Well, that
might be a problem!
345
Chapter 23: Ten Differences between ACT! 2005 and ACT! 2005 Premium 

Your best bet to order volume license software is to contact an ACT! Certified
Consultant. All certified consultants sell volume licenses of ACT!. In addition,
you might ask if the consultant is a platinum level reseller; platinum resellers
offer you the very best prices.
Great things don’t come without a price, and ACT! is no exception. The MSRP
for ACT! 2005 is $229, although you can expect to pay somewhat less than
that at most retail and Internet sites. You’re probably thinking that because
ACT! 2005 Premium does a lot more it costs a bit more. Good thinking — the
MSRP of ACT! 2005 Premium is $399.

T
here’s always room for improvement, and ACT! is no exception. For the
benefit of you loyal fanACTics out there who upgraded to ACT! 6 from a
previous version — and for the new fanACTics, too — this chapter highlights
a few changes that I find particularly useful. So many new enhanced features
are in ACT! 2005 that limiting myself to my favorite ten new features was
really difficult. But, upgraders take heart; even though ACT! 2005 contains a
plethora of new features, the basic look and feel of ACT! is still alive and well. 
Sequel
The loyalty of ACT! users never ceases to amaze me. Many ACT! users start
off as single users and find their business expanding by leaps and bounds.
Other ACT! users move on to larger companies. Ironically, when an ACT! user
finds himself in a new working environment, he or she first sharpens a few
pencils, hangs a picture or two, and then looks around for the company’s ACT!

database. I’d be a very rich person if I had a quarter for every time a large cor-
poration called me in to install ACT! because “the new guy” couldn’t live with-
out it. Unfortunately, however, there were times that I couldn’t help because
the user had simply outgrown ACT!. Well friends, those days are over!
If I were forced to have only one favorite new ACT! 2005 feature, it’s a rather
intangible one. Previous versions of ACT! were all based on a technology that
limited the size of the database. Various factors, including the number of con-
tacts, fields, notes, and histories, all contributed to the size of the ACT! data-
base; when the database got too big, users experienced a drop in performance.
Because ACT! 2005 is SQL-based, size limitations are hardware-based rather
than mandated by the software. Simply put, you can have a whole lot more
contacts in your database than before and you don’t have to limit the number
of fields you add.
Large organizations demand large or “enterprise” solutions to their comput-
ing needs. They want to limit the contacts specific users can access. They
want to schedule things such as conference rooms and equipment. And they
not only want to see the calendars of their co-workers, they want an easy way
to check their availability before they schedule meetings. Finally, with ACT!
2005 Premium Edition, ACT! has a true enterprise version.
Another benefit of SQL is that supplemental files — layouts, reports, and tem-
plates — are stored in the database. For some of you, this isn’t a big deal, but
for any of you that synchronize your database to remote users, this feature is
huge. You no longer have to send supplemental files out to your remote users
via e-mail or carrier pigeon.
Opportunities
The good news was that ACT! 5 introduced sales opportunities. The bad
news was that the feature was not as flexible as most users would have
hoped. The bottom line is that the sales opportunities module in ACT! 5 and 6
was a “what you see is what you get” experience; you couldn’t customize any
of the fields, and many users were frustrated by the lack of functionality they
were experiencing. Chapter 20 tells you about all these great new additions to
ACT! but I’m so excited about them that I just have to mention a few of my
favorite improvements to the opportunities area again:
 Customize eight opportunity user fields
 Include multiple products in a sales opportunity
 Transfer your opportunity information directly into a customizable
Word quote template
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 View a list of all your current opportunities, zoom in on any given item,
and send the entire list over to Excel if you so desire
 Choose from many new sales reports
 Create a lookup by opportunity fields or products
New and Very Much Improved E-Mail
One of the exciting things about ACT! is that over the years it has slowly
evolved into a better and better program. Sometimes the little things just
make a program that much easier to use. A case in point is three minor, but
much needed, improvements to ACT!’s e-mail features:
 Multiple e-mail address fields: Just as most people have multiple tele-
phone numbers, more and more people have multiple e-mail addresses.
They may have a personal e-mail address and a business e-mail address.
ACT! now allows you to add multiple e-mail addresses for each contact —
and use all of them.
 Lookup by part of the e-mail: In earlier versions of ACT!, the e-mail field
wasn’t actually a field — it was a table. Although this didn’t cause much
of a problem most of the time, it did cause a number of minor irritations.
One of them was that you could only search by the beginning letters of
an e-mail address. Now, because the e-mail field is a real, live field, you
can search for any part of the e-mail address when using a keyword
search.
 Alphabetical sort by e-mail: Another frustration many ACT! users expe-
rienced in previous versions was the inability to create an alphabetized
list of e-mail addresses. Again, this was caused by the fact that e-mail
addresses were stored in a table and not a field. Guess what folks —
because of the new improvements to the E-mail field, you can now get
that list. 
Cool New Field Types
Most of you old-timers have discovered how easy modifying fields is in previ-
ous ACT! versions. And, you had a variety of different field types to choose
from. For most of you, this ability was what made ACT! so appealing. ACT!
2005 expands the list of field types by adding six new field flavors to the mix:
 Yes/No: With all due respect, I would have named this field Check Box
because that’s exactly what it does — creates a check box, allowing you
to indicate “Yes” or “No” with the simple click of the mouse.
349
Chapter 24: Ten Cool New Features in ACT! 2005

New to ACT! 2005 is the ability to easily choose several items from a
drop-down list. In previous versions of ACT!, you could do this if you
played around in the program a bit — or found someone willing to show
you the trick. 
 Memo: Most of the time, you want to put your long winded explanations
on the Notes tab; however, sometimes you may want some very specific
note information to appear on your layout rather than getting buried
under a mass of other notes.
 Pictures: After all, they’re worth a million words. So if you want to
include contact specific pictures on a contact record, you can.
 Address fields: You just have to love this new feature. Many of you like
to add new addresses for shipping or billing information. In previous
versions, you had to add each new field for the address, city, state, and
zip code individually. The new Address field feature automatically adds
these additional fields for you.
 E-mail: I mentioned it before and I’ll mention it again: ACT! 2005 allows
you to track more than one e-mail address for each of your contacts.
And, best of all, you get to send e-mail to any of those addresses.
 Decimal: This field allows you to specify a field as a number and include
decimal places.
ACT! 2005 has another new feature that isn’t a new field type exactly, but
rather an embellishment of an existing field. ACT!’s Contact field has tradition-
ally been two fields rolled up into one: a First Name field and a Last Name
field. This was generally a good thing because it allowed you to look for a con-
tact by either his first or last name. At times, however, this was a bad thing. 
If you were looking for Tom Smith, you had a choice of searching for either
“tom” or “smith”. Either way, you probably ended up with a long list of match-
ing contact names, which you then had to hunt through to find the smith
among the toms, or the tom among the smiths. ACT! 2005 has introduced the
Lookup by Contact, which allows you to search for the entire name at one
time. And the contact field now includes a specific area for a middle initial.
The All New Documents Tab
There’s a new tab in town, and it’s called the Documents tab because it lets
you store all your contact-related documents on one tab. In ACT!’s prior ver-
sions, there was a Notes/History tab. The good news was that it was a great
place to record notes and histories about your interactions with a contact.
You could even attach a file to a note, which allowed you to access saved files
in a jiffy. The bad news was that as time marched on, the number of entries
on the Notes/History tab became larger and larger until you reached the
point where you just couldn’t find anything anymore.
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

ACT! 6 introduced the Library tab, which seemed a great idea at the time; you
now had a tab dedicated solely to your saved files. And, so the theory went,
you could open those files right inside of ACT!. Unfortunately, the Library tab
proved to be a little flaky; the files were slow to open and, if not closed again,
ACT! started to crash and burn. ACT! 2005 still lets you attach files to the
History tab. However, I suspect that you’ll soon be spending a lot of time on
the Documents tab. Unlike ACT! 6’s Library tab, documents opened from the
Documents tab open in their appropriate programs. For example, an attached
spreadsheet opens in Excel, and word processing documents open in Word.
In Chapter 5, I give you the full skinny on the Documents tab.
Consistency of Templates
In ancient times, or at least in the earliest versions of ACT!, there lived an
ACT! word processor. This was a good thing because some ACT! users didn’t
own a word processor and were thrilled beyond words to receive one with
ACT!. Documents created using ACT!’s word processor received the .tpl
extension, which stood for template. As Word became more and more popu-
lar and most ACT! users started using it, ACT! allowed you to decide whether
you wanted to use Word or the ACT! word processor; if you chose to use
Word, your templates were given the .adt extension. Then, to confuse you
further, ACT! 6 added an e-mail template with the extension .gmt. And of
course, these templates had no compatibility; you couldn’t e-mail a template
created in Word or merge an e-mail template with your word processor. 
ACT! 2005 has decided to end the confusion by allowing you to save docu-
ments in various formats no matter what your word processor preference.
And, your documents are now multi-tasking because they’ll work equally well
on paper or as e-mail templates. If you think this idea sounds good, head to
Chapter 13, where you find all the pertinent details.
Prior to ACT! 2005 you received letterhead, fax, and memo documents that
you could customize and this was a good thing. Now, however, ACT! comes
equipped with a whole bunch of sales and marketing templates as well as
several newsletter templates.
All the News That’s Fit to Print
Rumor has it that all of you loyal ACT! users love to print reports. And, a few
of you more adventurous people even like to customize the format that these
reports use. Those of you who are into creating reports are just going to love
the new ACT! reporting features.
351
Chapter 24: Ten Cool New Features in ACT! 2005

Quick Print
One of the features many ACT! fanACTics found to be particularly useful was
the ability to print out any of the ACT! list views. Chapter 5 talks about list
views and shows you how easy they are to customize. Although this feature
has always been integral to ACT!, the ability to print these lists out with cus-
tomizable headers and footers is a new ACT! 2005 feature. ACT! users can
now create “quick and dirty” reports on the fly — all the while producing a
professional-looking product.
Redesigned Report Writer
For years, loyal ACT! users struggled with the creation of customized reports.
Most of you found it to be confusing at best and a downright pain at worst.
Although creating customized reports is still a feature best left to the more
advanced users of ACT!, the new Report Writer is much more intuitive than
the old one. And you can add a much wider variety of fields to your reports.
When created, save your reports in either HTML or PDF format. If you want to
become better acquainted with the new Report Designer you might want to
scurry over to Chapter 12.
Improved Activity Series
Although prior versions of ACT! included the activity series, ACT! 2005 has
added several much needed improvements. After you create a series, the
individual activities in the series are linked together so that when one activity
in the series is rescheduled or removed you’re prompted to change the rest
of the series accordingly. For example, you may have a whole series of steps
that you run through each time you encounter a potential customer. But sup-
pose that the prospect loved you from the get go, rendering the last sales
steps unnecessary. When you delete or change one of steps, ACT! asks you
what you want to happen with the remaining activities.
And, unlike in prior versions, you can now assign each step in the series to
unique members of your organization rather than having to assign the entire
series to the same person.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Grouping by Company
The Group feature has always been one of my favorites because it allowed
you to tap into one of the most powerful ACT! elements: the ability to create 
a “one to many” relationship. For example, you might use a group if you are 
a contractor building a house and you needed to be able to find all the sub-
contractors involved in the project. The new Company feature takes that idea
a step further. You might be working with several contacts in a large organiza-
tion but not be able to remember which exact person you spoke with. Or, the
company may relocate and you find yourself having to change the addresses
for the 25 company employees. You might even need to further group the
company members into subgroups or divisions so that you can easily find all
the members of the sales or IT departments. You can accomplish all this and
more through the use of companies, and Chapter 22 shows you how to do it.
Cool New Look and Feel!
All right, I know it’s not one of the more crucial new features, but ACT! under-
went a radical facelift with the advent of ACT! 2005. I like to tell upgraders
that it’s kind of like buying a new car. It feels strange at first, especially that
first time you have to turn on the lights or the windshield wipers. Just take a
deep breath and realize that the lights do work — you just don’t turn them on
the way you did before!
Although the icons are still located exactly where you expect them to be,
they’re updated to give them a slightly more modern look. ACT! now has
more of a Windows feel to it; you can navigate in ACT! to return to the previ-
ous window just like you do in your Internet browser. You’ll also notice that
the Navigation bar on the left side of the screen has a bit more flexibility than
it did before. You’ll particularly want to use the Nav bar to take you to two of
the exciting new additions: Companies and Opportunities.
Being left-handed, I’m often accused of doing things backward. However, I
think we’re all in agreement that, generally speaking, slapping a label on the
top of something makes more sense than on the bottom. After all, who ever
heard of putting a file folder label on the bottom of the folder? In previous
versions of ACT!, the tab labels were placed beneath the tabs; in ACT! 2005
they’ve been moved up to the top of the tabs where they belong.
Despite the many changes in ACT! 2005, you should find most of the original
features that have been around since the earliest editions of ACT!. And, with
the introduction of several wizards throughout the program, you should find
that some of the more advanced areas — such as creating a new database or
adding customized fields — are easier to manipulate than before.

B
y now, you know about the various powerful and timesaving features
that you find in the ACT! program. But I believe that you can never have
too much of a good thing. With that thought in mind, I give you ten sugges-
tions that allow ACT! to work even better — if that’s possible. Some of my
suggestions include products that are available for purchase; other sugges-
tions are free to one and all.
If you’re looking for more information about any of the items I list in this chap-
ter, please visit my Web site at http://techbenders.com/act4dummies.htm.
Because something new is always on the horizon, check back often to find
out about the latest and greatest ACT! products, enhancements, and tips.
Refreshing Your Data
It seems like everyone is in a hurry these days, and ACT! users are no excep-
tion. In order to get the optimum performance in ACT!, screens don’t neces-
sarily change “before your eyes.” This is the same thing you experience when
looking at a Web site; the stock quote you’re looking at might change after five
minutes and you need to refresh your screen to see the “latest and greatest.”

Most of the time, ACT! refreshes automatically when you move on to another
screen. However, if you make a change in ACT!, such as adding a new layout,
and find that the change didn’t seem to happen, you need to refresh your cur-
rent screen with a simple Ctrl+F5.
Linking Your PDA
Who doesn’t use a handheld these days? They’re great for people on the go —
and ACT! lets you take your database along with you. And, if you believe that
the best things in life are free, you’ll be happy to know that ACT! 2005 includes
both the ACT! Link for Palm OS and the ACT! Link for Pocket PC right on the
installation CD.
The links allow you to sync your ACT! information (including notes and his-
tory) with your handheld device in just seconds. Your ACT! information syn-
chronizes to the basic fields that are included with the Palm or Pocket PC.
ACT! links allow you to
 Map basic ACT! Contact fields including phone numbers, snail mail, and
e-mail addresses, several custom ACT! fields, and the ID/Status field.
 Synchronize ACT! contact notes and histories for each ACT! contact. 
 Synchronize a select group of contacts if you are using the Group feature
in ACT!
In addition, mini-versions of ACT! are available for Palm, Pocket PC, and
Blackberry handheld devices. These mini-versions of ACT! allow you to view
your customized ACT! fields. You can schedule activities and create notes
exactly as you do in the full-blown version of ACT!.
Linking Your Accounting Software
Most of you business owners out there need at least two pieces of software 
to run your business: database software to keep track of customers and to
market to potential customers, and accounting software to help you keep an
eye on your bottom line. Unfortunately, a piece of software that does it all
often comes with a whopping price tag and a very steep learning curve. As a
result, maybe you’ve chosen to use ACT! for your contact management and
Peachtree or QuickBooks for your accounting. If you have larger accounting
needs you might be using MAS 90, 200, or 500.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Accounting links are available to link your accounting software to ACT!.
These products eliminate the need to enter your contact information into
both applications. You can enter the contact information into either ACT! or
the accounting software and then synchronize the information between the
two. The link inserts a new accounting tab into ACT!, showing all the perti-
nent Accounts Receivable and Payable information for any linked contact in
ACT!. This feature allows your sales team access to invoice and payment his-
tory without sharing the rest of your confidential accounting information.
Sharing Your Database over the Web
For the past 15 years, ACT! users everywhere have been relying on ACT! to
take care of their contact management needs. During that same time, reliance
on the Internet has increased dramatically. Maybe you’ve contemplated using
an online calendaring system, such as the one that Yahoo! provides, just so
that you could access your calendar while away from the office. If you choose
that solution, however, you lose some of the functionality that makes ACT! so
appealing in the first place. Keeping your calendar in an online program other
than ACT! essentially cripples ACT!’s power.
One of the greatest strengths of ACT! is the ease in which you can enter 
notes and other pertinent data into a database. Better still, if your database is
located on a network drive, you can share all that information with the other
members of your staff. However, many salespeople find that they are not in
the office on a regular basis yet want to share updates with the home office.
One way to share information is by using a Web-based product.
Using an online product allows you to access, update, and share ACT! infor-
mation via the Internet. Best of all, the information is in real time. You can
perform lookups, run reports, and work on the Web-based version of ACT!
just as if you’re working back in the main office.
There are several huge benefits of having your ACT! database on the Web:
 All users can access the database on a real time basis.
 Unlike other Web-based CRM solutions, you still deal with ACT!. 
 The Web-based version of ACT! offers good security options to limit
which users have access to your database and which contacts they’re
allowed to view and edit.
 A remote user isn’t able to “take the database with him” should he leave
your company.
357
Chapter 25: Ten Tips to Make ACT! Work Better

So why isn’t everyone using a Web-based version of ACT!? Well, the service
does have its limitations:
 You must have access to the Internet. If you like to work from various
client locations or even on an airplane, you likely don’t have an Internet
connection, limiting when you can use the Web-based version of ACT!.
 You must purchase the Web-based version of ACT!, which is slightly
more expensive than the ACT! program itself. Each of your remote
users also must purchase the Web-based version of ACT! rather than the
traditional version even if they already own a regular ACT! license.
 You need a Web server with IIS installed at the site where your ACT!
database resides, a licensed copy of ACT!, and a Web site. This limita-
tion doesn’t mean, however, that you have to host your own Web site.
What it does mean is that you must buy a fully licensed copy of ACT! for
both your Web server and anyone wanting to access ACT! offline.
Several Web-based versions of ACT! are on the market. Although not available
in retail stores, they are available for purchase directly from most ACT!
Certified Consultants. Talk to one of them to help you decide which product
is best for you.
ACT! Add-Ons and Enhancements
There were probably over 300 add-on products that worked with ACT! 6. As of
this writing, developers were scrambling to rewrite their existing products —
or create new ones to fill a perceived gap in ACT!. Here are a few of my favorite
products.
ASDS
Steve McCandlish of ASDS Computer in Denver believes if it ain’t broke, fix it
anyway! He racked his brain and came up with several housekeeping solu-
tions that really make most offices purr along quite nicely. A few of my
favorites include
 MigrateAdmin: After you discover all the cool new features of ACT!
2005, you’ll be kissing other contact management products good-bye.
MigrateAdmin converts data from other sources, such as GoldMine and
Access, into ACT!. MigrateAdmin converts all basic contact data as well
as custom fields, histories, notes, activities, and sales data.
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 DocAdmin: Allows you to scan documents onto the Documents tab of
ACT! 2005 with a single mouse click. It automatically names the file and
attaches it to the ACT! contact record in PDF format, making the docu-
ments extremely portable. A DocAdmin license is needed only for the
workstation that does the scanning; all other users can automatically
see the document.
 FaxAdmin: Unlike earlier versions, ACT! 2005 no longer supports
WinFax. FaxAdmin allows you to fax right from within ACT! 2005 via
WinFax and MS Fax. Using this tool, you can easily write letters and 
send them via fax, send fax cover pages, send quick faxes, and do a 
mail merge and fax.
 MedleyAdmin: Includes a series of custom controls for enhanced lay-
outs including tabs within tabs, a personal dashboard of critical daily
information, and an automatic fill of city and state upon zip code entry.
Also included with the product are a series of tools that include Group/
Company tree views, a Group/Company Calendar window, Multi-Group
lookups, and lookups of who is not in a group.
The New Hampton Group
Sometimes it’s the little things in life that prove to be the most annoying,
whether it’s the missing cap on the toothpaste tube or ACT!’s inability to
quickly copy field information from one field to the next. Geoff Blood of The
New Hampton Group is a real “do-it-yourself” kind of guy. I can just imagine
the type of things he was creating with his erector set when he was a little
boy. The last time I checked his Web site he had over 20 “enhancements,” as
he calls them, that help with many of the minor, albeit annoying, little things
that ACT! just can’t do. My personal favorite TNHG enhancements include
 Sales Dash Board: Provides you with a “Tachometer” display of sales
performance-to-quota for the week, month, quarter, and year.
 Schedule Board: Displays a grid, with each column representing a user
(or resource), and each row representing a time-slot. You can quickly
see who is busy and when.
 AutoFill ACT! Fields: Automatically loads any number of ACT! fields
with values determined by the contents of another field.
Northwoods Software
Some of you may feel that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Well, for
many years now the nice folks at Northwoods Software have been providing
ACT! users with free ACT! add-ons. These add-ons consist of various free
enhancements to ACT!. As of this writing, I don’t know how many of these
359
Chapter 25: Ten Tips to Make ACT! Work Better

products will be updated to ACT! 2005, but, knowing those prolific folks,
they’ll probably be updating a bunch of them.
Northwoods also produces several fee-based products. Among my 
favorites are
 Sales Automation Mania: Allows you to define and automate your stan-
dard sales processes. The program literally prints your mail merges or
sends your birthday newsletters in the middle of the night.
 Mail Merge Mania: Sends mail merge blasts that avoid ISP limitations
and allows you to insert ACT! fields in both the body and the subject line
of an e-mail template.
 Web Prospect: Reads the mail you receive from your Web site registra-
tion forms and creates contacts in ACT!, saving you hours of re-typing.
Reporting Software
ACT! comes with an amazing array of reports right out of the box. And, if you
read Chapter 12, you see how easy you can tweak those reports. Because
variety is the spice of life, you might find yourself wanting to wander “outside
the box” and hankering for a different report. Unfortunately, ACT!’s Report
Designer can be somewhat limiting when designing complex reports that
involve multiple levels of grouping, filtering, and sorting.
Most report writing software requires an in-depth knowledge of tables and
queries. However, the folks at Stonefield Query have taken a relatively difficult
process and made it pretty much “dummy proof.” Reports are created using a
wizard that lets you pick from all the available fields in your database, decide
how you want to use those fields, and then preview your results. Reports that
used to entail hours of programming can now be created in minutes, passed
on to the other folks in your organization, and used over and over again.
E-Blast Software
Chapter 13 talks about mail merging and mentions some of the pitfalls you
might encounter when attempting an e-mail blast. One of biggest problems
you might encounter is your ISP’s reluctance to let you send more than 50 or
so e-mails at a time. Another common problem is knowing how to create a
cool-looking HTML template. Well, worry not my friends. A multitude of prod-
ucts are available to help speed you on your way — or to at least speed your
e-mail blast on to your customers.
360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

E-blast software comes in three flavors that I like to refer to as small, medium,
and large. The small products are the least expensive and offer less function-
ality; the large products are designed for those of you who are basing your
marketing efforts on e-mail and are willing to pay for it.
 Small: Helps you overcome the limitations set by your ISP by sending
out your mailing in a series of smaller blasts. These products are gener-
ally good for people who want to send out text e-mail messages rather
than the more graphical ones. Small products generally run around $100.
My recommendation is MergeMaster! Pro by GL Computing.
 Medium: These products generally include templates for the HTML-
challenged members of the crowd who want to send out snazzy looking
e-mail blasts. These products usually cost you slightly more money but
are well worth it. My favorite is Ace Mailer by Visual Data Integration.
 Large: If you are marketing to a database with over 1,000 contacts,
you’re faced with a whole new set of challenges. You’ll want to be able to
track your “opt-outs” so as not to violate any spam laws. You might also
want to track how many people actually open your e-mail message or
who they forward it on to. Several products can do that for you — and
more. These products are generally subscription-based and generally set
you back $20 to $100 a month; however, when you consider the cost of
printing, folding, labeling, stamping, and sending via snail-mail, the price
is a bargain. I highly recommend Swift Page Email if you do large scale 
e-blasting.
As of this writing, software developers were scrambling to rewrite their exist-
ing products to work with ACT! 2005. Check the For Dummies page on my
Web site at http://techbenders.com/act4dummies.htm to find out more
about the various products as they become available.
Tips from the ACT! Guru
I am very fortunate to have had Mr. Roy Laudenslager as the Technical Editor
of this book. Roy spent over 10 years assisting befuddled ACT! users in his
capacity as senior support specialist at Interact, Symantec, and then Best
Software. If you ever had an ACT! support incident “escalated” to the highest
level of support, you probably had the good fortune to have spoken to Roy.
And, if you’ve ever read any of the Knowledge Base articles at www.act.
com/search, there’s a good chance that Roy wrote it! 
361
Chapter 25: Ten Tips to Make ACT! Work Better

Roy’s mind is amazing — he has an encyclopedic memory when it comes to
any and all things ACT!. He tackled learning ACT! 2005 and immediately came
up with a few tips that I want to pass along:
 Roy likes to view the mini-calendars by pressing the F4 key from any
ACT! screen. After he’s there, he right-clicks a day to see all the pertinent
details. If you double-click a day, you land in your daily calendar. You’ll
notice, by the way, that any days with scheduled activities are bolded.
 In Chapter 16, I mention how you can use an anchor field to determine
the width, height, and alignment of other fields in your layout. Identify
the anchor field by the solid handles on the field. When you select multi-
ple fields, ACT! automatically decrees that the last field selected is the
anchor field. To designate another field as the anchor field, press the
Ctrl key, click the field once to deselect it, and then click it a second time
to make it the anchor field.
 Some of you multi-taskers like to view several ACT! screens at the same
time. For example, you might want to view the Contact Detail window
and the Daily calendar at the same time. Roy searched until he found 
an obscure setting to enable him to do just that. From any ACT! screen,
choose Tools➪Preferences➪Startup Tab and check the Open Each View
in Its Own Window option.
 Roy’s favorite shortcut is to create a lookup on any field simply by right-
clicking the field in the Contacts Detail window and choosing Lookup. In
fact, Roy makes a habit of right-clicking throughout the ACT! program
looking for shortcuts along the way.
Thanks for sharing, Roy!
Hiring an Expert
I like to say that ACT! is kind of a “good news, bad news” product. The good
news is that ACT!’s MSRP is fairly inexpensive; the bad news is that ACT!’s
MSRP is fairly inexpensive. You might assume that because the software price
is low, it is a fairly easy product to master. 
My mother told me that the word assume has a special meaning. Not sure
what it is? Write to me at dummies@techbenders.com!
People who have been using ACT! for over 10 years often come out of my
classes shaking their heads and muttering, “Gee, I didn’t know that!” In fact,
many consultants have been known to mutter, “Gee, I didn’t know that,”
because part of the fun of ACT! is discovering an unknown shortcut or feature.
362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

ACT! Certified Consultants make their living by helping ACT! users discover
the full power of the program. You can find a local consultant by choosing
Help➪Service and Support➪ACT! Consulting from any ACT! screen. Can’t find
a consultant nearby? Many ACT! consultants like myself use tools that allow
us to remotely access your computer.
Your local IT person might claim to “know” ACT!. To me, that’s kind of like
taking an anatomy class and claiming to “know” surgery. Because of the com-
plexity of ACT!’s file structure, save yourself time, money, and aggravation by
going directly to an expert.
Some ACT! consultants also have an additional certification. ACT! Premier
Trainers (or APTs) not only help you customize your database, they help you
learn how to use it. You find a list of ACT! Premier Trainers by going to www.
act.com/partners/apt/.
I could buy a scalpel, but I don’t think you’d want me to perform brain
surgery on you! So it goes with ACT! — save yourself a lot of time and 
frustration and let an expert help you to get up and running quickly.
Joining a Users Group
John Kaufman of Compass Technology LLC is an ACC who runs the South
Denver ACT! Users Group. Regular attendees find the information that they
learn there about ACT! and ACT! add-on software invaluable. They also get
tips and tricks from other ACT! software users. Attendees find John’s Users
Group to be a really great way to stay updated on new and innovative ways 
to use the ACT! software for their businesses and to test drive some of the
add-ons before actually purchasing them.
Don’t live in Denver? I run the ACT! Users Group of South Florida where 75
ACT! fanatics regularly hang out to learn more about ACT!.
Don’t live in Colorado or Florida? Don’t worry, Users Groups are in virtually
every state of the union. To find a local Users Group, go to http://act.com/
