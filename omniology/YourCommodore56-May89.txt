Telecomsoft Sale
rrelecomsoft, the company that
hosts the Rainbird, Firebird and
Silverbird labels, i s up fo r  sale.
Rumours have been nibbling at our
ears for a while and even now, with
the probing tongue o f conﬁrmation
beating on our eardrums, the reality
of a sell-off is hard to bear. But wait,
I'm starting to  sound like one o f
Rainbird's novellas.

while suggestions of a sale were being
repulsed b y the company's upper

putting their weight behind a manage-

suitable agreement, the team has now
conceded defeat and the company has
been offered fo r sale on the open
market.
Bids are obviously being kept a
close secret, but the Mirror group,
Activision and NEC have all been
named as prospective buyers. A high

price is expected fo r Telecomsoft,
whose turnover amounted to almost
E6 million last year, which is what one
might expect from a company that
boasts such a healthy presence in the
budget market.
The only ﬂy i n  Telecomsoft's
ointment is the loss of a major part
of Rainbird's software selection and
development team. As reported in last
month's Data Statements, Hibbard
and company have defected to Mic-
roprose, which must leave their old
label in a vulnerable position when a
buyer is announced.
Thoughts o f  a split are being
discounted by Ms Byrne, who recently
claimed that the three labels together
represented a winning formula as the
best software house in Europe.

Slaying Competition
A  wood just off the M42 may seem
like a strange venue for an Amer-
ican civil war, b u t that i s what
happened recently when Microprose
engaged Electronic Arts in a duel to
the death.
Casualties were low as the oppos-
ing factions dashed from tree to tree
armed with paint guns and goggles,
and at the end of the day, Microprose
was covered in glory while EA was
covered in paint.
The 'friendly' war was played out
in the battle zone owned b y the
Combat Game company, who ensured
that no real harm came to the com-
batants. Perhaps EA's valiant but
unsuccessful showing may have been
due to  an unconﬁrmed report that
Microprose's ex-USAF boss, 'Wild'
Bill Stealey, was preparing to do a
supersonic straﬁng run to  ensure
victory.
Of course, all this warlike activity
couldn't possibly have anything to do
with the fact that Mieroprose have
bought the rights to Universal Military

Gribbly's Back
Tt's like meeting an old friend -
Gribbly Grobbly has returned to the
Hewson fold after an absence of ﬁve
years or so. In Gribbly's Special Day
Out, our one-footed Blabgorian hero
treads where he has trod before, but
this time he's a real smoothy. For this
RackI t  re-release, the scrolling routine
has been updated to make i t ultra
smooth. This game is a real cutie for
E2.99.
Also fresh fro m Hewson are
Storm lord, Cyberdyne Warrior and
Mazemania. Raffaelle (Exo(on) Cecco
has set the scenario of his latest game,
Stormlord, in a world of endangered
fairies. Imprisoned by the evil Queen,
Stormlord has to free the peaceful fairy
folk before they are all wiped out.
Cyberdyne Warriors is a  rogue
droid round-up for bounty hunters,
and Mazemania is an action puzzle
which requires skill and coordination.

Up, Up and Away
S tar Micronics are sponsoring an
attempt to ﬂy a hot-air balloon
over the world's highest peak, Mount
Everest. The attempt will be made in
autumn by Per Lindstrand and Chris
Bonn ington.
Bonnington is no stranger to the
29,028 f t  high mountain after his
successful attempt at becoming the
ﬁrst man to climb its south-west face
in 1985. Lindstrand is a vastly expe-
rienced balloonist whose most cele-
brated feats have been the ﬁrst trans-
atlantic crossing in a hot air balloon
(with Richard Branson in 1987) and
gaining the altitude record the follow-
ing year, reaching a height of 65,000
feet.
The third member of the team is
cameraman Mark Jerrold, who will be
recording the incredible feat fo r
posterity.

T
Toy & Hobby Fair was held at
the Earls Court Exhibition
Centre, and it needed a venue of that
size to comfortably accommodate the
vast number of stands.
Everything you'd expect was there,
ranging from ﬂuffy Count Duckulas
to Japanese super-heroes and, o f
course, hi-tech executive toys. There
weren't as many, electronic gadgets as
I'd expected, but the ones that did
appear were of a high quality indeed.
Bandai, as expected, had a verit-
able squadron of radio-controlled cars,
and some o f  them wouldn't have
looked out of place on the Star Wars
set! Apart from these cars, there were
also quite a  few hand-held games.
These were principally sports games
and included soccer, volleyball, car
racing and tennis. In style, they ran
along the lines of those game'n'watch
toys that you get at Sunday markets
for a
their Cat 'n•Mouse game, though I
doubt that Warner Brothers would
appreciate h o w  m u c h  t h e  c a t
resembled Sylvester. There were three
shooting games, too: Space Force,
Tank Shooting and Defensive Gun. I
didn't get to play them, but the only
difference appeared to be what you
used to shoot with, and what you shot
at.
Much more exciting was Bandai's
Video Challenger. This set contains a
futuristic-looking gun and a  video
cassette, Just put the tape into your
recorder and off you go. This reminded
me o f  the Captain Power toys -
interactive television, they call it. The
tape shows a jet zooming all over the
place, and surprise, surprise, you have
to shoot it. Try as I might, my score
stayed ﬁrmly a t zero. Your score
doesn't appear on the screen but in
a small panel just below the sights on
the gun. The video itself seemed to be
almost of laser disc quality. I'd really
like to  see this take off, (no pun
intended), as the idea is well executed
and, for we satelliteless unfortunates
who aren't able to  watch Captain
Power, it's an admirable substitute. To
make it successful, though, Bandai will
need to expand the range o f tapes.
There are, apparently, two more tapes
to be had: Monster Maze and Chase.
I couldn't ﬁnd them, so whether they're
up to the standard o f the ﬁrst one
remains to be seen.
At the VTECH stand the emphasis
was ﬁrmly on education. There was
a wide range of pre-school toys on
PREVIEW
show, bright and colourful, with lots
of noises and buttons to push. Small
Talk is a brightly coloured telephone
with a different picture on each button.
By pushing the relevant button, the
caller is put through to the person
shown. All the obvious ones are there,
such as Mummy, Daddy and Police-
man, as well as those who might not
spring to mind so easily (have you ever
talked to an astronaut?). These char-
acters will call back when the receiver
is replaced. There are also buttons with
animals on that make the relevant
noises and a small musical keyboard.
I'm sure parents are going to love their
kids playing with that during the ﬁlm
they've been waiting to see.
School Bus comes with eight
blocks which ﬁt into the side of the
bus. The bus asks a  question and
Junior has to put the correct blocks
in the holes. The questions are the
standard numbers,/ letters/ animals
sort.
Talk Board is for slightly older
children, and it's shaped like the old
Speak and Spell toy. Again it asks the
usual questions, but you also get an
electronic boardgame to play.
Yet another talking toy is Mother
Goose Caboose. It comprises a Wild
West-style engine and a  truck. The
Mother Goose bit refers to the four
nursery rhyme characters that can be
put onto the engine's roof. Each plays
a different tune and there are four
blocks, similar to the School Bus ones,
to complete the set.
When I was a boy we used to have

a plastic steering wheel on the end of
a plunger. In the middle of the wheel
was a red button. When pushed, it let
out a faint squeak. You could stick
the whole thing on to a chair and drive
round all day without leaving the
room, VTECH have updated this idea
and improved it no end. Talking Little
Busy Driver allows the little dears to
listen to eight tunes on the car radio
and ﬁve types o f  siren. There are
working indicators, a gear stick and,
for puppy yuppies, a earphone. Add
this to the alphabet and shapes that
are on the dashboard and you've got
enough to keep even the most easily
bored kid happy on a long journey.
The whole thing can be attached to
a high chair or side of a cot by two
Velcro straps. Why didn't we have
them in my day? It is rather expensive

though, a t just under E40. That's

Wizard and Mi n i  Wizard are
'follow m e '  typ e  games. W h o
remembers Simon from a few years
back? These, however, have a maze
game incorporated into the fun.
Naturally, there had to be at least
one sports game and VTECH deliver
three. Talking Rallyracer. Soccer and
Baseball, to be precise. They all look
good and all have effective, if simple,
graphics. Soccer and Baseball boast a
'realistic announcer's voice'. Rally-
racer has 'true to life' sound effects.

cash.
Pre-Computer 1000 is the business!
The top half contains a narrow screen,
and just below that a range of buttons
which are used fo r selecting your
chosen subject including science,
geography and history. Below these is
a QWERTY keyboard j u s t  choose
your subject, pick a level and off you
go. The questions are by no means
easy. On level three I got only half
the questions right, so a  feature I
appreciated was the HELP button.
You start off with two lives and each
time you ask for help, the computer
gives you one letter of the answer. On
the third help, it tells you the solution.
There are to be a further ﬁve question
cartridges. I can't wait for my specialist
subject. Fantasy Trivia, to appear. The
others are General Knowledge 2, Bible
Knowledge, Assorted and Speller.
This was my favourite item in the
Show.
There were also had a number of
music keyboards and something called
Socrates, which connects to your TV
and uses animated graphics to teach
basic essentials to kids aged ﬁve and
above. Unusually for this type of thing.
there were touch pad and mouse sets
to add on. Three extra cartridges will
also be available: Pre-school, Brain
Teasers and Awareness. A cute robot
is your friend and guide through these
adventures.
The Ko n i x Multi-System was
looking good. For all those who miss
the hydraulic fun of Super Hang-On
at your local arcade, the Power Chair
is for you! It tilts, banks and generally
moves in synchronisation with your
joystick. It comes with a seatbelt, and
you mount your monitor on the chair,
presumably so that when you turn a
corner, you can still see the screen. This
is all well and good, but how many
people have got the space for one of
these? The Light Gun is much more
sensible, Resembling something Dan
Dare might use, it has a recoil action
and auto ﬁre. Surely anyone who uses
auto ﬁre will be bounced all over the
room like a squash ball..? Anyway,
there's a neat add on to convert it into
a riﬂe, if you want.
Two weird little games from Elﬁn
Design caught my eye. Poi is a plastic
sphere with a small gap at the base.
Inside the shell is a ball with a maze
engraved on its surface. The idea is
to manoeuvre the ball so as to get a
PREVIEW
little red light from one end of the maze
to the other. Having seen someone try
and fail dismally to complete it, I
wasn't keen to make a public fool of
myself. It will keep you busy during
those cold summer evenings and is
excellent fun.
Timerunner. What a name! What
a game! It looks like a cube, roughly
six inches square. On each side there
are six silhouettes o f elves. They're
repeated randomly on each side. When
turned on, a set of lights shows the
order that the shapes must be touched
to win. When the ﬁrst one's completed,
it's onto shape two, and so on. There's
a time limit, naturally, and i t seems
generous until you realise that a
mistake means starting over. In this
case, mistake means not only touching
the wrong shape, but repeating a move.
Unless i t's switched o ff, i t  w i l l
remember the fastest time. While I was
there, one of the Elﬁn Design people
Wizard - a follow-me' type game, but with a
twist
completed it in what seemed like only
seconds. For us mortals it'll take much
longer. I love this so much I wanted
to marry it.
Ever heard of Nuvue? Neither had
I but soon you will when Loony Letters
appears in the shops. It's an animated
word game. You get a  video tape
containing cartoony letters. They
appear every ﬁve seconds, and when
ﬁfteen have jumped up you have
ﬁfteen seconds to  make the best
scoring word you can. Things don't
always go your way - occasionally a
whistle sounds and you have to
exchange score sheas wtih the other
players. That means even the editor
could win a game like this. The game
comes from Australia - maybe by way
of an apology for Neighbours.
There you have it. Lots of fun and
I hope these toys all get British buyers.
It'd be a shame not to see them take
off over here.

Turbo
Touch
Are you a two-ﬁngered
typist? Could a tortoise
write more words per
minute. I f  so,
'Turbo Touch' could
change all that
A
is designed to  turbo charge
your typing ability. I f  you
practise frequently w i th  'Tu rb o
Touch', you should be able to accel-
erate your tempo to exceed 300 keys
per minute and reduce your error rate
to less than one percent, which is not
bad for a program written entirely in
Basic. 'Turbo Touch' also features
multi-colour graphics, sound effects,
perpetual feedback (measured against
the C-64 internal clock), and artiﬁcial
intelligence.
Artiﬁcial intelligence in this con-
text means the ability to read, interpret
and translate any given text into key
strokes for practise purposes. In other
words, 'Turbo Touch' can be custom-
ised according to the literacy level of
the user.
Even young children can learn with
this program, because parents and
school teachers can make the exercises
very easy if necessary. It's even possible
to create exercises in other languages,
as long as they use the same alphabet
as english. Such ﬂexibility makes this
program feasible for use by a very wide
range of people, and the variety largely
eliminates the inevitable boredom of
repeatedly typing 'The quick brown
fox'... etc., which is typical of most
other typing tutors.
USING 'TURBO TOUCH'
There will be two prompts when you
start up. The ﬁrst asks which
exercise you want to load. You may
select one of three prefabricated ones
- all ﬁnger, cap letters and practise
text, o r  a  previously customised
exercise. The second prompt asks how
many keys per minute should be
allowed before eliminating the help
function which highlights the keys you
must press. Help is allowed up to a
maximum o f 150 keys per minute:
above that the keys will only be
highlighted to correct mistakes.
The 'all ﬁngers' exercise shows all
the proper ﬁnger positions needed to
become a  proﬁcient touch typist.
Youll need to practise often with 'all
ﬁngers' (or a similar self-made exer-
cise) to develop coordination. Once an
exercise is loaded, the computer screen
displays a  keyboard with all black
keys, except for the 'home keys' which
are blue (for easy reference). Your
ﬁngers should be rest lightly on the
'home keys' (without pressing them)
before and after each key stroke, in
the following manner:
THUMBS: (space) Either thumb can
be used on the space bar.
When you're below the speed set
in the second prompt (at start up), the
keys will highlight themselves in the
order in which they must be entered.
The colour of the text line will be
changed one character at a time, each
time the correct key is entered. Mis-
takes will result i n  an annoying
buzzing sound, which is intended to
act as 'negative reinforcement'. Mul-
tiple mistakes on the same key will
continue to sound off the buzz, but
only one error per key will be counted
in the feedback updates at the end of
each text line. If, after making several
errors, the buzzing starts to drive you
goggle-eyed, then just lower the
volume.
Once you're familiar with the
'home keys', the rest is relatively easy.
The remaining keys need only be
learned in terms of how many keys
above, below or next to the 'home keys'
they are. The only extra thing youll
still have to learn is using the SHIFT
keys for capital letters and certain
symbols and punctuation. SHIFT-ed
characters should be entered using one
hand to press the character key, while
the little ﬁnger of the opposite hand
holds down the SHIFT key (on either

side of the keyboard).
'Turbo Touch' keeps track of the
total keys, total errors, and total time
elapsed since the ﬁle was loaded. Using
this information, the program updates
the error rate and the average number
of keys per minute each time one full
line o f text has been processed. A
typewriter-like 'ping' sound is used to
indicate that the end of line perfor-
mance feedback has just been updated.
CREATING AN
EXERCISE FILE
T
here's nothing to it. LOAD and
I_ RUN ﬁl e  maker', and just start
typing whatever you like. The ﬁle
maker works like a  simple word
processor: D E L  deletes, RETURN
goes to the next line, and the F2 key
saves the ﬁle under a name to be
speciﬁed by the user.
The DEL key is able to back trace
the entire 40 line length of the ﬁle if
neceSSary, but it's a good idea to double
check for mistakes, so that you don't
have to delete too many lines to correct
them if you don't notice them till much
later. The DEL key is also useful when
C64 P R O G R A M
words are cut off at the ends of lines.
In that event you can delete the partial
word, and then press RETURN to go
to the next line and enter the full word.
After saving a ﬁle, you can make
as many copies as you like and the
program will automatically name
another ﬁle by changing the last few
characters of the ﬁle name to indicate
the copy number. You don't have to
bother with copy numbers yourself,
since ﬁle names can be abreviated
(example: 'abc copy 3' is the same as
'abc*').

and these are as follows.
TURBO TOUCH - The main program
TT/ FILE MAKER -  An editor that
allows you to  create your typing
exercises
TT/ SCREEN MAKER - A program
that saves out the intro screen used
by TURBO TOUCH.
All of the programs are in Basic
and should be entered and saved using
our easy entry program (See listings
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989

pages for more details). Each program
should be entered and saved to disk
seperately. T h e  p ro g ra m T T /
SCREEN MAKER when RUN save
a new ﬁle out to  disk called Ti ',
INTRO SCREEN. Once this is on
your disk the program TT/SCREEN
MAKER is no longer required.
The ﬁnished Turbo Touch suite of
programs should now consist of:
TURBO TOUCH
TT/ INTRO SCREEN
TTi FILE MAKER
Once you have these programs you
can sta rt creating y o u r  typing
exercises. You should load and run the
program TT/ FILE MAKER in order
to create your test ﬁles. You will not
be able to use TURBO TOUCH until
you have created at least one test ﬁle.
Software For Sale
Should you purchase software through
our Readers Services department then
you will ﬁnd that a number of exercise
ﬁles have been included on the disk.

Teletext on your 64 or 128 brings you the very latest information
free! And unlike a Teletext TV you can print pages like todays
TV, save a recipe to disc or cassette. The ability to access
Teletext data from your own programs provides endless
possibilities. Ceefax and Oracle provide hundreds of pages of
news, share prices, weather and road reports, even bargain
holidays plus much much more.
The Microtext Teletext Adaptor ﬁts neatly on the user port, just
connect it to the Tuner and plug in an aerial or the Adaptor alone
may be connected to the VIDEO OUT socket of a video
recorder.
The Microtext Adaptor is only E79,85, Adaptor and Tuner just

There's a lot more to
Commodore disk drives
than ﬁrst meets the II Q
c
lieve, Commodore disk drives
are the most powerful available
for any 8-bit computer. They have a
comprehensive built-in DOS, RAM.
ROM and 6502 processor. It is the
software support of the C64 that lets
the system down. Under the control
of certain cartridges, the 1541 even
outstrips the BBC drives.
This article contains a selection of
simple programs and hints which you
don't usually ﬁnd i n  Commodore's
manual.
Easy loader
Before today, you have probably
loaded in the directory to check on
a program name. You may have
cursored up and put LOAD before the
ﬁlename and .8 after it - this is useful,
but also time consuming. This method
allows you to put ,8 or ,8,I after the
name in the directory entry when you
are saving the program. By loading the
directory, moving to the correct name
and pressing SH IFT and R U N /
STOP, you will be able to load your
program quickly and easily. This is
even better if you have an extended
Basic with a directory read facility
installed.
SAVE" FIL E N A M E <  
[
D
]
8< >  ",8 adds ,8:
SAVE"FILENAME <  SP> [ D ]  8
[D] 1",8 adds ,8,1
SF =  shift + space
[D] Commodore key + D
= shift +
The only restriction about this method
is that ﬁlenames must be II characters
or less.
Save and Replace
I'm sure that you have heard the
rumours of this function scrambling
disk, yet it is one of the most important
of all disk facilities. Apparently, the
problem is caused by omitting the
drive number. This is a hangover of
double-disk systems, where the two
drives were assigned the drive numbers
0 and 1. Any Commodore single drive
is 0 and omitting this number causes
the drive to  ignore some o f  the
available buffers, corrupting the disk
when there is a lot of shufﬂing of ﬁles
to be done.
The solution is always to include
the drive number:
SAVE"@
becomes
SAVE"@ 0:PRGNAME",8
This method has never given me any
problems.
Scratch one character
ﬁles
Sometimes, due to a typing error, you
get an unwanted ﬁle on disk with only
one letter in the name. No problem,
scratch it. Wrong, it won't scratch. The
solution is:
OPENI5,8,15,"S:?":CLOSE 15
Selective Directories
Commodore DOS allows you to view
speciﬁc parts of the directory, as well
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
15
as the standard directory. When
pattern matching and wildcards are
used, it becomes a powerful command,
allowing you to check a disk for a
particular program. Here are some
examples:
LOAD"SS:NAME",8
- lists only NAME's entry
LOAD"S:CO",8
- lists all entries beginning with CO
LOAD"S:*=S",8
- lists all sequential ﬁles
LOAD"S:MUSIC*=P",8
- lists only programs beginning with
MUSIC
LOAD"S:r64",8
- lists all four character ﬁles with 64
at the end
Software Speed-up
This allows small speed increases with
the scratch, validate and rename
commands by speeding up the move-
ment of the head between tracks.
OPEN15,8,15: PRINT # 15, "M - W"
CHRS(7)CHRS (28) CHRS (I)CHRS
(15)
Unobtrusive Load
You will, no doubt, have found i t
annoying that there is no easy way to
load a program from inside another
program without causing the program
to re-run. This method calls the Kernal
routines directly so that the load will
be executed only once, and the pro-
gram will continue from the correct
line after the help screen, machine code
or similar feature has been loaded.
POKEI47,0: SYS57812"NAME",8,1:
SYS6263 I
Rescuing Unclosed Files
I'm sure you have come across this
problem. When accessing a ﬁle, an
error stops your program, o r  the
computer is switched off by accident.
Most of the data has been transferred
to disk and should be easy to retrieve.
Strangely enough, when you try to
reopen the ﬁle, you get a WRITE FILE
OPEN error, Examining the directory
reveals an asterisk beside the ﬁlename.
This means that the ﬁle was not
properly closed and i s therefore
useless. An undocumented command
to the rescue! This allows you to open
the ﬁle and retrieve as much of it as

possible using INPUT # 5 or GET # 5
OPEN,8,5,"FILENAME,M"
Append
If you are manipulating sequential
ﬁles, particularly in databases, then
you know that the only way to add
information to an existing ﬁle is to
reload the whole thing, add the new
info and resave. The DOS provides an
easy way of adding this information
with the minimum of work. The DOS
can reopen the ﬁle, and tack the extra
information on the end of the existing
ﬁle. Note that this is only an append
and, as such, will not correct infor-
mation in the middle of a ﬁle. Never-
theless, it saves considerable time when
no alterations need to be made to the
ﬁrst ﬁle.
OPEN5,8,5,"FILENAME,APPEND"
Copy and Concatenate
This is a very under-used command,
as it usually only creates the same ﬁle
on the same disk under a different
name. Even with this limitation, it can
still be useful. Fo r example, when
using a database or wordprocessor you
could copy a saved ﬁle as "BACKUP"
and allow this to be recalled as an
'Oops' option in case of an irrecov-
erable mistake. The syntax is
OPEN 15,8,I5,"COPY: NEWFILE
OLDFILE"
Copy also allows you to append ﬁles
that are previously stored on disk,
inﬁnitely useful for a wordprocessor:
OPEN15,8,15, "C:TOTAL = FILEI,
FILE2, FILE3"
Reset Drive
This command will reset the drive
completely, as if it had been just turned
on. The device number and computer
type will be reset.
OPEN15,8,15, "111": CLOSE15
Change Device Numbers
This allows the standard disk drive
(device 8) to adopt a different number,
which is essential if you need to use
two drives at once. NM is the number
that you wish to allocate to the drive
(usually 9).
PROGRAMMING
OPEN15,8,15: P R I N T  # 15, " M -
W"CHR (119) CHRS (0) CHRS (2)
CHM (NM+32) CHRS (NM+64)
Well that's all the quickies - now
for some meatier programs which deal
with features o f the C64 operating
system.
Directory
This compact program can be used as
a subroutine in your Basic program,
or during program development. Any
business program must have a direc-
tory read, and this is as good as any.
10 OPEN 1,8,0, "$"
20 GET # 1,XS,XS
30 GET # 1,XS,XS,XS,XS
40 IF ST THEN CLOSEI:
RETURN
50 GET # 1, X$: ' F M  = ""THEN
PRINT: GOTO 30
60 IFXS=  CHM (34) THEN P =
NOT P
70 IF P THEN PRINT X$;
GOTO 50
Blocks Free
This scans through the directory until
it comes to  the BLOCKS FREE
statement, and puts it into BF. This
can be useful for the user to ﬁnd out
how much space there is on the disk.
Also, i f you know the length of the
ﬁle you are saving, you can check to
see if there is enough room on the disk
before you start saving.
10 OPEN 10,8,0, "SS"
20 E O M  =  I  T O  3 5 : G E T
I0,XS:NEXT
30 GET I0,YS:CLOSE 10
40 B F  =  ASC  (XS+CHRS(0)) +
256*ASC (YS + CHRS(0))
50 PRINT BF "BLOCKS FREE":
RETURN
Block Save
Most people know that altering the
Basic pointers at locations 4346 allows
any block of memory to be saved. This
has its drawbacks because it wrecks
your Basic program. The below
method is useful if you have to save
graphics data from within a program.

Block Load
This method does not alter the Basic
pointers like the normal ,8,I sufﬁx,
which gives an ?OUT OF MEMORY
error.
10 OPENI,8,1, "FILENAME,P,R":
POKE780, 0: SYS65493: CLOSE I
Load Address
It is often useful to ﬁnd a program's
load address because it gives a clue
as to what the program actually does.
Use the following:
10 INPUT"PROGRAM NAME"; N$
20 OPEN2,8,2, NS +",P,R"
30 GET # 2,XS,YS
40 PRINTASC (XS +  CHRS (0))
+256*ASC (YS +CHRS(0))
50 CLOSE2
Device Indicator
There's a handy location that gives the
device number which was last used.
In practice, this means that programs
can tell i f the user loaded with tape
or disk, and which disk i t  was.
D=PEEK (186) will store the device
number in D.
Keep track of ﬁles
Using several ﬁles can sometimes
become messy, especially when they all
have to  be closed i n  a  complex
program. SYS 65511 closes all ﬁles,
and is useful i f an error condition
occurs. PEEK (152) will give the
number of active ﬁles at any time.
Last ﬁlename
SYS 62913 will print the name of the
latest ﬁle that has been loaded. It uses
parts o f  the SEARCHING FOR
message routine. Naturally, i f  this
routine has been disabled, then this
hint will not work.
That should be enough quickies for
you. Prepare yourself for further disk
delights in the near future,

Banker is designed to  work with a
Commodore-style printer, and most
other printers that use channel 1,4.
Getting Started
First you need to form a P.I.N. code.
On loading you will be confronted with
the loader screen. At this stage, (as you
are using this for the ﬁrst time) you
must enter [left arrow]. You will ﬁnd
this key located at the top right-hand
side of your keyboard • enter this key
and press [RETURN]. You are now
asked various questions regarding
your personal use of Banker.
First you are asked to enter a PIN.
code. This can be any code you wish
to enter that the computer will then
use as a ﬁlename for your personal
details. (Please note that this code is
not intended as some form of security
procedure, simply a ﬁlename to save
time on entering personal details on
future loadings). Enter your P.I.N.
code followed by [RETURN]. You
will now be asked to conﬁrm it -  i f
it's correct, simply type "Y" for yes.

The next question is, how many
accounts do you intend to  use this
program for (BANKER can be used
for up to ten bank accounts). For the
purpose of this demonstration type I
[RETURN]. You are now asked to
input the year. You will see that "88"
has been entered in for you i f  that
is the correct year, simply press
[RETURN], if that is not the correct
year then tap in '89 or whatever the
year is and [RETURN].
Account Details
You are now in the accounts ﬁeld, and
are looking at the words ACCOUNT
1. This is the account we are going
to answer questions on ﬁrst. The ﬁrst
question is NAME OF BANK - please
do not use any punctuation in your
reply. Now answer the questions
ACCOUNT TITLE and FILENAME
FOR THIS BANK. This is the ﬁle-
name the computer will give to your
completed account ﬁle, so as to save
it for future use. Any ﬁlename will do,
(except the ﬁlename you have already
used as the name of your P.I.N. ﬁle).
Next, you're asked about standing
orders, the cost per month, when you
ﬁrst started paying the order, and for
how long the payments are to last. (The
computer needs this information to
calculate when the payments end, and
therefore when to start deleting them
from your tiles). If the order is of the
permanent kind -  fo r example, a
standing order to the Gas Company
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
20
- and therefore carries on regardless,
enter S at the question "IS THIS A
STANDING O R D E R  O R  A
REPAYABLE LOAN (S/L).
Conﬁrmation Mode
If you're using this program for more
than one account, you are now invited
to go through all the details again for
ACCOUNT 2  and any subsequent
accounts. Since for the sake o f this
demonstration we are only using one
account, we now move into the
conﬁrmation mode. The computer will
now run through your answers so you
can conﬁrm them. If there is a fault
in the details, answer N at the question
CORRECT ( Y / N) and you'll be
returned to the start to correct your
mistake. If they are correct, answer Y
and a ﬁle will be formed with your
new P IN , code. You are now back
at the loader screen ta p  in your newly
formed P.I.N. number, and the com-
puter will load your ﬁle into the
memory.
On subsequent loadings o f  this
program, the above procedure need
only be followed i f  there are any
changes to your personal details. I f
there are no changes, simply type in
your P.I.N. code.
Before we can enter the MASTER
MENU, there are still a few questions
to answer. The answers to these
questions have already been tilled in
for you, using the information from
your P.I.N. File, so all you are doing

for the most part is conﬁrming the
answers.
The year has been entered for you,
leaving you to  input today's date.
Please ensure that you use the correct
format (01.01.88) when entering the
date.
There is one question in this ﬁeld
where (as you are a ﬁrst time user)
the answer has been entered incor-
rectly. This is the question which asks;-
"ARE YOU LOADING THE FILE
FOR THE FIRST TIME? The answer
NO has been entered, whereas we are
in fact loading the ﬁle for the ﬁrst time,
so you'll need to change this answer
to YES.
After completion o f these ques-
tions, you will encounter another
conﬁrmation ﬁeld -  i f  you have
completed the answers correctly,
answer Y for yes. You are now into
the Master Menu.
There are six options at the top of the
Master Menu screen -  Cheques,
Cashpoint, Bank Orders, Payments,
Totals and Others - And ﬁve options
at the bottom - Save to disk, Update
ﬁles, Change entry, Printer option, and
End of run. We are now going to deal
with the top six.
Press the [1] Key, for CHEQUES,
and you w i l l  be faced w i th  the
CHEQUES MENU.
You will see you are faced with
three options on the cheque menu -
as option three is self-explanatory, we
will deal with the ﬁrst two.
The Master Menu
C128 PR O G R A MMIN G III
OPTION I :  Press the [1] key, for
MAKE AN ENTRY, and you will be
faced with the CHEQUES ENTRY
MENU - simply answer the questions
CHEQUE N U M B E R ,  D A T E ,
AMOUNT, and ITEM. On the cheque
number it is advised for simplicity that
you enter the last three digits of the
number instead of the whole number.
When using it for the ﬁrst time you'll
ﬁnd a 'I' has been entered for you -
just type over this, as it is for your
next entry, where it will show your
next cheque number (just so long as
your cheques go up in ones!). When
ﬁlling in the date, it is the date that
the cheque was cashed on that is
needed, and please remember to use
the correct format. On ﬁlling in the
amount, do not use the I '  sign.
When all the cheques to date have
been entered. depress the [E l l  This
can only be done once you have
returned to the 'CHEQUE NUMBER'
mode.
OPTION 2: After exiting the ENTRY
MODE, you will automatically be
taken into the VIEW MODE. After
viewing your entries, hit any key and
you will be returned to the Master
Menu.
CASHPOINT AND OTHERS: The
exact same procedure is repeated for
both the CASHPOINT and OTHERS
options. In the OTHERS mode you
will see that under ITEM, cheque book
has been entered in for you automat-
ically - this is because this is the sort
of item the OTHERS ﬁeld has been
designed for, deducting the banker's
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
21
charges for a new cheque book, 0:
basically anything that is deducted
from yo u r account, other than
cheques, cashpoint entries, and stand-
ing orders. If your OTHERS entry is
not for "cheque book", simply type
your item i n  over "cheque book".
Please remember to erase any remain-
ing letters of -
your item be shorter.
OPTION 4: On entering this ﬁeld you
will be faced with a slightly different
menu. Option 1 is used for viewing
all o f  your bankers orders on a
separate sheet (this sheet i s n o t
calculated with the rest o f  your
account and is for viewing only). On
leaving this option you will ﬁnd
yourself back at the BANK ORDERS
MENU.
Option 2 is a very powerful option
that will calculate all your bank orders
for this month. On subsequent load-
ings of the ﬁle, this option will check
the date o f the loading and decide
whether more orders need to be added
or not. It will also take into account
when a standing order has ﬁnished
(using information given about that
order in your P.I.N. ﬁle), and enter
a "CANCELLED" entry for that order
from that date on.
OPTION 5: On entering this ﬁeld,
you'll see the usual menu of MAKE
AN ENTRY/ VIEW ENTRIES, and
it w o rks i n  th e  same w a y  a s
CHEQUES. On entering the MAKE
AN ENTRY mode, you'll see that pay
is entered in for you automatically, as
the payments mode is designed to take
any income to your account, if pay
is not the required item, simply type
over it with your item (as we did with
"cheque book" in the Others mode).
On viewing your entries, you will
see that the ﬁrst entry shown is
"BALANCE", and that i t will be
valued at 00.00. Don't worry about this
at the moment, as we will deal with
this at a later stage. You will also note
that in this ﬁeld, the total expenditure,
total income, and balance is revealed,
these ﬁgures being the accumulation
of the whole account (cheques, cash-
point, standing orders, etc).
Please remember that for the total
expenditure (and therefore balance) to
work correctly, the computer has to
calculate the standing orders. There-
fore for a true reading, you must enter
the VIEW BAN K ORDERS ﬁeld
before using option 5.

OPTION 6: This option simply shows
the T O T A L  E X P E N D ITU R E .
TOTAL INCOME, and BALANCE,
as did the view mode of PAYMENTS
TO TH E  BAN K (option 5). The
difference with this option is it also
shows the breakdown o f each sub-
section (cheques, cashpoint, etc), as to
how it reached the ﬁgure shown at
TOTAL EXPENDITURE.
Please note that as with option 5,
for the total expenditure (and therefore
balance) to work correctly, the com-
puter has to calculate the standing
orders. Therefore for a true reading
you must enter the VIEW BANK
ORDERS ﬁeld before using this
option.
Saving Your Files
We have now completed all the
sections of the top six, and we can now
continue to the other ﬁve sections of
the Mister Menu.
OPTION 7: This option saves your
completed ﬁle to  disk; using the
ﬁlename that was appointed for it in
your P.I.N. ﬁle (It's also the ﬁlename
that you conﬁrmed in the opening
questions to the Master Menu -  see
page 3).
Before saving your ﬁle -  because
of the way your disk drive handles the
information -  each section (cheques,
cashpoint etc) has to have at least one
entry. The computer will check this
automatically, and if any section has
been left empty, it will enter a 'NIL'
and a value of 00.00.
Because o f its composition, the
'Bank Orders' section must be viewed
to calculate the automatic entries.
Should you attempt to SAVE your ﬁle
before viewing 'Bank Orders', you'll be
returned to  the Master Menu. On
returning, view the Bank Orders
(option 4,2), and then return (option
7) to SAVING.
If in doubt, view the Bankers
Orders before any option above 4 on
the Master Menu.
Updating Your Files
This is a powerful command, used for
updating your ﬁles after receipt of a
bank statement from the bank holding
the account that you are working on.
Option 8 : This section works b y

enabling you to delete cheques and
other payments that appear on the
bank's statement. By showing you each
section at a time, you are able to delete
items that are shown on the bank's
statement, therefore leaving only the
items not yet cleared by the bank. The
end product is an up-to-date account,
without hundreds of items not needed
because they've already been cleared
by the bank.
On entering this option, you will
ﬁrst be asked for the balance from the
bottom o f your 'issued' bank state-
ment.
This ﬁgure is the balance at the
bottom of the statement informing you
how much is left in (or owed on) your
account. On entering this ﬁgure it will
be placed in the BALANCE column
in the view mode of PAYMENTS TO
THE BANK' (option 5,2 of the master
menu). This is the ﬁgure which showed
00.00 when we viewed the section
earlier.
On entering the ﬁgure fo r the
BALANCE, you will be taken auto-
matically into the 'delete cheques'
mode. You will notice that down the
side of your entries is the numbering,
from entry I to whatever amount of
entries you have in your ﬁle.
To check the bank's statement,
simply tap i n  the number which
corresponds with the ﬁrst cheque
shown on the bank's statement and hit
[RETURN]. You will note that the
entry is now completely obscured by
asterisks (*****).
Continue on this way, until all the
cheques shown the statement are
blanked out in the same way. Now tap
in r ]  [RETURN] and the computer
will delete all the cheques marked with
the *******.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
22
Deleting the remainder of your ﬁles
(Cashpoint, Others, Bank orders, and
Payments), is done in exactly the same
way as you did i n  the DELETE
CHEQUES mode
On completion of the ﬁnal section
of the 'Upating Files' mode, you'll
automatically be taken into the view
mode of BANK ORDERS. Exit this
mode as usual.
After using the Update Files
option, the program is used exactly the
same way as before, and each section
can be viewed or the ﬁle saved.
Please remember that i f you save
the ﬁle after updating, it will be saved
'updated' and the previous ﬁle with all
the extra items (that we do not need
anymore) will then be deleted from
your disk.
Changing Entries
Option 9 of the Master Menu enables
you to change an entry if you make
a mistake. If, for example, you incor-
rectly type in a cheque number in the
ENTRY mode o f CHEQUES. You
simply continue through the page until
you can exit (see page 4), return to
the Master Menu, and then select
option 9, where you can alter the
cheque number to the correct number
and then return to the Cheques mode
to continue with the next entry.
OPTION 9: On choosing this option,
you will see the CHANGE ENTRY
MENU, categories t o  change:
CHEQUES, CASHPOINT, OTH -
ER
notice t h a t  t h e  o th e r section,
BANKERS ORDERS, is not present
this is because all entries to this
section are automatic, and therefore
there should be no mistakes.

Should you wish to delete an entry
in any of these categories, (including
Bankers Orders), you should use
option 8 -  updating ﬁles. CHANGE
ENTRIES i s  f o r  changing, n o t
deleting.
To change an entry made in the
Cheques mode, you would use option
1 o f  the CHANGE ENTRY menu.
Press the key [1] now. You will now
be faced with the Cheques change
mode menu. You'll see the words
"ENTRY N O. 1
which will be displayed your ﬁrst entry
from the CHEQUES mode, if you wish
to change this entry press [C], if not,
you can scroll through the entries by
pressing [.], to scroll forward, and [,]
to scroll back.
Once you've chosen the entry you
wish to change. and have pressed the
[C] key to change, you'll be asked to
input each detail again (date, cheque
number, etc). If, for example, the fault
was in the 'cheque number', simply
press [RETURN] to the other ques-
tions and they will remain unchanged.
After changing the incorrect item, the
display above will change to show the
amended version. You're now free to
scroll through for any other mistakes,
or to return to the Master Menu (this
is done by pressing the [R] key).
To change CASHPOINT, OTH-
ERS, AND PAYMENTS entries, you
choose the relevant number in the
Change Entry menu, (see above), and
follow the exact same procedure as for
Cheques (see above).
Printer Option
The printer option is the most impor-
tant part of the Banker programme,
the part that actually prints out bank
(style) statements of your account. The
beneﬁt of this is that your statements
will always be more up-to-date than
the bank's. lf, for example, you cash
a cheque on the 2nd of January, and
you receive a bank statement from
your hank on the 3rd, the cheque will
not be shown, therefore luring you into
thinking you have more money than
you actually have! This is obviously
not a good thing, as it leads to all sorts
of problems...
"Now", you say, "but I keep a
running balance in the stub o f my
cheque book". "Yes, but d o  you
account for standing orders, bankers
charges, costs of, for example, a new
cheque book that you ordered on the
22nd, and it slipped your mind?"
Of course, another way of checking
C128 P R O G R A MMI N G ' ,
is to load up your Banker program
and view through the various sections,
ﬁnishing with section 6 (totals). Well,
of course this is by far the safest way
of doing things, but now thanks to
option 0 - the printer option - all you
have to do is check your own, up-to-
date bank statement.
Your bank statement is split up
into the different categories, as is the
programme, fo r easy viewing (see
attached demonstration statement).
The computer will automatically print
the date, bank name, and your account
title, at the top of the statement. It
will then print the date, item, cheque
number, debit, and credit, for each
section in turn, concluding with the
total expenditure, income, and bal-
ance, of your account to date.
To use this option press [0] in the
Master Menu and you'll be asked to
conﬁrm that you want a  printout
(statement) -  this is in case you had
pressed the [0] by accident. Answer Y
for yes, and you will be asked to ensure
the printer is turned on. Check that
the printer is on, and there is paper
in it, and then hit any key. Your
'STATEMENT' will now be printed.
On completion of printing, you'll be
returned to the Master Menu.
End Of Run
To end the program, use option 'A'
on the Master Menu). On pressing [A],
you will be faced with a few 'safe-
check' questions, the ﬁrst of which is
checking that you didn't press 'A '
accidentally, and therefore giving you
the chance to return to the Master
Menu as if nothing had happened. The
remainder o f these questions check
that you have saved the ﬁle (option
7), and whether you wish to calculate
another account (if you select this, you
will be returned to  the LOADER
TITLE SCREEN awaiting your P.I.N.
Code). If you reply to this question
that you do not wish to  calculate
another account, the computer will
reset itself. Your computer is now
ready to run any other program you
wish to use.
Conclusion
We have now worked through each
section of the Master Menu, and by
this stage you should be fairly con-
versant with the system. You should
have entered all items from your
account, you should have viewed
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
23
them, you might have (for demonstra-
tion purposes o r otherwise) altered
'them, you might even have deleted
some of them, you should have saved
them as a ﬁle, and if you own a printer
you will most probably have printed
them out into a statement... Now it's
time to reload your ﬁle and update
(or add to) it.
We can, a t this stage, either
completely reset the computer and
reload Banker, or simply, using option
'A' ask to view another account. Either
way we will now end up with the
Loader Title Screen in front of us.
Because we've already formed a
P.I.N. Code, we don't have to enter
a lot of boring details about accounts
and standing orders, we simply enter
our P.1.N. Code and the computer will
load it all in a matter of seconds. Please
note that if you enter the P.I.N. Code
incorrectly, the computer will reply
with a 'FILE NOT FOUND' message,
and you'll be returned to the Loader
Title Screen.
On successfully loading the PIN .
ﬁle, you'll enter once again the
questions page that precedes the
Master Menu. Again all the answers
are already placed in for you, and all
that remains, i s fo r  you t o  h i t
[RETURN]. The only difference this
time is that you must answer 'No' to
the question, "ARE YOU OPENING
THE F I L E  F O R  T H E  F I R S T
TIN/En Also, for the sake of dem-
onstration, it might be a good idea to
add a month or two in the Date Field,
just to watch the Bankers Orders ﬁeld
doing its stuff!
Because you entered "NO" to the
"ARE YOU OPENING THE FILE
FOR THE FIRST TIME" question,
you will note that on entering the
Master Menu, there is a line between
the sections ﬂashing, reading;-
* * * * *  PI,EASE WAIT LOAD-
ING FILES **********"• This is
because the computer is loading the
'old' ﬁle that you have just saved. Once
this ﬁle has been loaded, the PLEASE
WAIT LOADING FILES line will go,
and you will see a line in the top right-
hand corner ﬂashing; -  "FILES IN
MEMORY". You will of course have
seen this before, as this line comes into
effect as soon as any entry is made
into any of the sections.
You are now ready to  add to,
delete, change or printout any of the
ﬁles. Remember to re-save the ﬁle,
before 'END OF RUNNING' once
you've started to use the programme
for your account.

C64 PROGRAMMING
Multi

to have your Basic program
listing in different colours?
For example, you could have half of
your program listed in blue, and the
other in white. But the main use I ﬁnd
is that you can highlight certain parts
of your program such as subroutines,
rem statements, messages, or even the
last part o f the program you were
working on!
The routine given will allow you
to do this with ease. I t  works by
inserting a REM statement at any line
you choose which holds a  string of
characters that actually changes the
colour o f your listing. To  use the
routine, ﬁrst type it in, save it out for
future use, and then to add colour the
syntax is:-
Brighten up your Basic Listings by adding some colour
with this handy routine
By Neil Higgins
SYS 53076, LINE NO, COLOUR (0-
15)
where LINE NO can be any valid basic
line number, and COLOUR is any of
the standard colour codes from 0-15.
If the line number chosen already
exists i n  your program, then the
following message will appear - LINE
EXISTS.CONTINUE lirj N. I f  you
press the Y key, then the line will be
replaced by a  REM statement and
your colour. If you press the N key,
then the old line will be left intact -
this is a safeguard so that you don't
delete important lines by mistake.
As a ﬁnal tip for people who don't
understand the beneﬁt o f this pro-
gram, let's say you have a subroutine
starting at line 1000 and ending at line
2000. If you want to make this list in
just the colour white, then you would
ﬁrst enter - SYS 53076,999,1, in which
case your listing would carry on in the
colour white, But we only want the
subroutine to list in white, and the way
around this is to include another REM
to change the colour back to normal.
Let's say for simplicity this happened
to be light blue. You would enter -
SYS 53076.2001,14, which will return
the colour after the subroutine back
to light blue, which was our original
colour. If you experiment with differ-
ent colours, you'll soon ﬁnd the best
ones that stand out.

This print effects package could bring your
Commodore screen to life!
By Mark Everingham
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989

A
you to death? Don't you wish
you could inject some life and
interest into your screen displays,
something more than turning them
some stomach-turning green colour in
an attempt to catch the user's atten-
tion? Well, PRINTEX can save you
from the oblivion of computer bore-
dom. Simply use the mystic SYS
command, and P R I M
your Commodore-using life!
So, after all these extravagant
claims that PRINTEX will change
your life, what exactly does it do? Well
essentially, it offers the Plus/4 user a
variety o f printing effects (or EX).
These can be used to liven-up your
boring screen displays, or for more
serious applications, for instance in
mimicking the output of a dot-matrix
printer for word-processing purposes.
Printing effects implemented range
from simple underlining to  bold,
italicised. underlined, vertically &
horizontally ﬂipped, double width,
double height text rotated through 270
degrees about the text origin, and
displayed using a n  exclusive-or
method. If you're struggling for breath
after that sentence, or wondering what
on earth i t meant, don't worry -
PRINTEX adds 20 new commands to
BASIC which make it simplicity itself
to operate.
Using PRINTFX
Commands
As I have just mentioned. PRINTFX
is operated through a new set of 20
BASIC commands forming an exten-
sion to normal CBM BASIC. These
commands work in exactly the same
way as the normal BASIC commands
and are fully supported with error
messages and function evaluation. For
example, the command TEXT prints
some text on the screen and has the
syntax shown below:-
TEXT xcoor,ycoor,"text t o  b e
printed"
Usually you would use something like
the command that follows to display
some text:
TEXT 18,10,"HELLO"
If, however, you want to print some
text at a position deﬁned by variables,
or want to allow the user to specify
PLUS 4 PROGRAMMING
the text to  be printed, this is no
problem. For example:
X C
"HELLO"
This will print "H EL L O" a t the
position (18,12) speciﬁed b y the
variables XC and YC. You could also
use an expression such as that below
to achieve the same effect.
TEXT 3*6, 3*4, "HELLO"
So any numeric argument can be
replaced with any expression which
yields a numeric result. The same can
be applied to strings:
INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME";
NS
TEXT 20-(LEN(N$)+6)/ 2,12,
"HELLO " + N$
As you can see, each argument may
be replaced with an expression o r
series of calculations which produce
either a numeric or string argument,
whichever is required. In this way it
is possible to achieve some complex
effects.
PRINTFX Error
Messages
Listed below are the error messages
that PRINTEX gives, and their rele-
vant meanings.
?SYNTAX ERROR -  You have
omitted one of the required arguments
or used a phrase which PRINTEX and
BASIC does not recognize i n  the
context.
?ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR -
One of the arguments you have used
is outside the valid range for that
argument. The appropriate range for
each argument is shown in brackets
in the next section.
?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR - You
have replaced a  numeric argument
with a string argument, or vice-versa.
The PRINTFX
Commands
What follows is a  list o f  all the
PRINITX commands, along with the
syntax they take, the actions they
perform and an example o f  the
command's use.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
27
TEXT xcoor (0-39), ycoor (0-24),
"text"
The TEXT command i s used to
perform the actual process of printing
some text on the screen, subject to the
special effects previously set up. Note
that if you are using double-width text
then the x-coordinate (xcoor) should
be in the range 0-38, and i f using
double-height text, the y-coordinate
(ycoor) should be in the range 0-23.
The text string can be of any length,
and the TEXT command will automat-
ically wrap the text around the screen
in the direction dictated by the MOV-
ING command.
BOLD ON/OFF
The BOLD command is the ﬁrst of
the special effects commands and is
used to switch on or off Bold printing.
The Bold typeface, which is sometimes
called "Emphasized" on Dot-matrix
printers, can be used for sub-headings
or to emphasize in-text headings. It
essentially widens every vertical line
within each character printed. Like the
other Effect commands, the BOLD
command takes only one argument
ON or OFF to turn the effect On or
Off respectively.
Example: BOLD ON:TEXT 1,16,12,
"BOLD TEXT": BOLD OFF
ITALIC ON/OFF
The ITALIC  command is used to
switch on or off the Italic typestyle.
This is usually used fo r  placing
emphasis on single words within the
main body of text. Alternatively it may
be used to highlight whole paragraph
quotes, or to indicate that a phrase
is o f Latin origin. The typestyle is
achieved by shifting the top half of
each character one pixel to the right.
The operation o f  the command is
identical to the BOLD command.
Example: ITALIC ON:TEXT 1,10,12,
"DULCE E T  DECORUM EST":
ITALIC OFF
UNDERLINE ON/OFF
The UNDERLINE command is used
to select whether subsequent printing
will be underlined or not. Underlining
is used for headings, or as an alter-
native to  italics for emphasis. The
effect is achieved by simply adding a
straight line to  the base o f  each
character.

Example: UNDERLINE ON:TEXT
1,13,12., "UNDERLINED TEXT":
UNDERLINE OFF
(0-360)
0
000
090
2
180
3
270
REVERSE ON/OFF
The REVERSE command produces a
similar effect to the RVS ONIOFF
control codes on the text screen in
Commodore Basic. The style inverts
each pixel of each character, produc-
ing a  white o n  black effect i f  in
monochrome,
Example: REVERSE ON :TE X T
1,14,12, "REVERSED TEXT":RE-
VERSE OFF
VTFLIP ON/OFF
The V IE L IP  command offers the
facility o f Vertically ﬂipping a piece
of text so that the top of the character
appears a t the bottom, effectively
turning it upside down. This can be
useful if making a piece of text follow
a shape on the screen.
Example: VTFLIP ON:TEXT 1,12,12,
"UPSIDE-DOWN TEXT":VTFLIP
OFF
H U M P  ON/OFF
The HZFLIP command allows horiz-
ontally ﬂipped text to be produced.
This is similar to Vertical Flipping,
except that it produces text which faces
left rather than right, each pixel on
the right being transferred to the left
and vice-versa. The effect can be used
when printing text from right to left
as directed b y  t h e  M O V I N G
command.
Example: HZELIP ON:TEXT 13,12,
"BACKWARDS TEXT":HZELIP
OFF
TURN stage (0-3)
The TURN command is the ﬁrst of
the special effects commands which
does not take a  single ON  OFF
argument, but instead a  numeric
argument in the range 0-3. The com-
mand is used to turn or rotate a piece
of text through an angle speciﬁed by
the stage argument. The text is rotated
about the centre of each character. The
stage number 0-3 produces the follow-
ing rotation:-
Stage (0-3) / Rotation in Degrees
PLUS 4 PROGRAMMING
Example: TU R N  1 :TE X T 9,12, O R D E R  "BlUVHTR
"TEXT ROTATED 90 DEGREES":
TURN 0
WIDTH 0/1
The WIDTH command is my own
personal favourite i t  allows text to
be printed twice the normal width with
20 characters per line. Even though
only 20 characters ﬁt on a line, these
can start a t  any position 0-38.
PRINTEX will take care of moving
the cursor two characters instead o f
one, and will wrap text across lines
correctly.
Example: WID TH  1:TEXT 3,12,
"DOUBLE-WIDTH TEXT":
WIDTH 0
HEIGHT 0/1
The HEIGHT command allows you
to print text twice its normal height,
with 12 lines o f text ﬁtting on the
screen at a time. These lines can start
at any line from y-7-0 to  y=23 and
PRINTEX automatically moves the
cursor two lines when wrapping text
across lines.
Example: H E IGH T 1 :TEXT 11,
1 I,"DOUBLE-HEIGHT T E X T " :
HEIGHT 0
Combining PRINTFX
Special Effects
If you've been keeping count, you will
have realised that 11 special effects
have been mentioned as achievable
using PRINTEX However, the real
beauty of PRINTFX is the ability to
mix different special effects. In this
way, it's possible to obtain more than
4000 effects by the combination of the
11 basic styles of printing. Every single
one of PRINTEX's effects can be used
together, even the double-width and
double-height commands. An example
of this is given below:
Example:
WIDTH I : H E I G H T  1 :ITA L IC
ON:BOLD ON
TEXT 1,1, "D OU BL E-WID TH ,
DOUBLE-HEIGHT, ITALICISED,
BOLD TEXT!"
WIDTH 0 :H E IGH T 0 : I T A L I C
OFF:BOLD OFF
In fact, many more than 4000
effects are available...
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989

It may not be very obvious, but the
order in which PRINTEX carries out
its special effects does in fact change
the way a piece of text appears. The
ORDER command can be used to
change the order in which the special
effects are carried out, although
double-width and double-height is
always performed last. The syntax of
the ORDER command is a  single
string which must be seven characters
in length, w i th  each character
representing a  special effect. The
default order is shown above, and the
characters in the order string are as
follows:-
Character
V
Special Effect
Bold
Italic
Underline
Vertical Flip
Horizontal Flip
Turn (Rotation)
Reverse
An example o f  the difference the
ORDER command makes is shown
below.
1. O R D E R  "BILIVHTR":BOLD
ON:REVERSE ON
TEXT 1 , I , " B O L D  
&
REVERSED (ORDER 1 ) "
BOLD OFF:REVERSE OFF
ORDER -
ON:REVERSE ON
TEXT 1 , I , " B O L D  
&
REVERSED (ORDER 2 ) "
BOLD O F F :  R E V E R S E
OFF:ORDER "BIUVHTR"
Using the ORDER command, i t is
theoretically possible to  produce
literally thousands more different
printing effects!
MODE STORE/PLOT/ERASE/IN-
VERT
If you've used the Commodore BASIC
CHAR command i n  the graphics
mode, you will know that whenever
it prints any text on the screen,
everything under the text is erased
completely. Most of the time this is
ﬁne, but sometimes you may want to
lay some text over graphics or erase
an area of graphics with some text to

produce a  rubbing-out e ffe ct.
PRINIFX can print its text in four
ways, and the MODE command is
used to select which method is used.
The four arguments and correspond-
ing effects are listed below.
Syntax / Effect
MODE STORE Erase everything
under text before
printing.
PLOT L a y  the text on top
of the graphics
below.
ERASE Reset each pixel that
the text consists of,
rubbing Out the gra-
phics only where the
text occurs.
INVER1Invert each pixel on
the screen where the
text is printed i.e. set
pixels become reset
and vice-versa.
Example: CHAR I ,0 ,0 ,"?
MODE PLOT
TEXT 0,0 "THIS TEXT IS
OVERLAID USING 'PL OT
MODE STORE
As another interesting aspect of the
INVERT mode, any text printed with
the mode set to INVERT can be erased
by reprinting the text in the same
position with the mode still set to
INVERT. This effect is often used in
arcade games to produce rapid smooth
movement.
EFFECT effect (0-255)
If you're using many special effects at
one time, you may be wondering i f
there is a quicker method of setting
up a special effect than using a string
of BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINE
etc.. commands, although these are
very easy to use. I f  you've become
familiar enough with PRINTEX, you
can set up any effect except TURN
using one EFFECT command. The
EFFECT command turns a number
in the range 0-255 into the combina-
tion of effects this number represents.
The number is built-up from eight
component numbers:-
Number /  Effect
128 B o l d
64 I t a l i c
PLUS 4 PROGRAMMING
32 U n d e r l i n e
16 R e v e r s e
8 V e r t i c a l  Flip
4 H o r i z o n t a l  Flip
2 D o u b l e - W i d t h
Double-Height
If you want an effect to be switched
on, then you add the number to your
accumulating total, or if not then leave
it as a zero. For instance, if you wanted
to set up Bold, Italicised, Reversed
text, the numbers you would use are:-
128 (Bold) + 64 (Italic) + 16 (Reverse)
= 208
Therefore, the command to set this
effect i n to  operation would b e
EFFECT 208. This short command
replaces the marginally longer BOLD
ON:ITALIC ON:REVERSE ON !
However, it is obviously not as easy
to understand, and so the value of the
individual effect commands should not
be underestimated.
Another interesting use o f  the
EFFECT command is to produce a
number o f  effects from a  single
FOR..NEXT loop. A program to show
256 o f  PRINIFX's special effects
follows:-
10 FOR E=0 TO 256
20 EFFECT E
30 TEXT 1,I,"EFFECT" + STRS(E)
40 GETKEY KS
50 NEXT E
UPPERCASE & LOWERCASE
All the examples we've discussed so
far have used the standard Commo-
dore upper-case font, which is i n
operation when you ﬁrst use your
Plus/ 4. This font gives upper-case
characters and shifted graphics char-
acters such as the Spade, Heart,
Diamond and Club. There may be
times when you want to use the lower-
case character set instead, which offers
both lower and upper-case characters
and so is more suitable for serious
applications. This is no problem - the
LOWERCASE command allows you
to do this. I f  you then want to use
the upper-case character set, just type
UPPERCASE.
Example:
LOWERCASE:TEXT
Text Using UPPER and
UPPERCASE:TEXT
Graphics: S  -A S  -S
( 
S
 -? indicates the
acter on key ?)
1,1,"Some
lower-case"
1,3, "Some

RAMFONT SA A A A /A A A A  &
CBMFONT
In addition to  using the standard
Commodore fonts which are located
in the ROM of your Plus„
at Some time prefer to use a character-
set which you've created using a
Character-Designer such as that found
on the Your Commodore YD I 6B, C16
Special Program Disk.
Usually, you can only print such
home-made characters in one style, but
using PRINIFX all of the thousands
of styles can be applied to your own
character-set, so you can even italicise
those little yellow Pacman characters
you have designed! To tell PRINTEX
that you wish to use a font based in
RAM rather than the standard Com-
modore ROM font, the RAMFONT
command is used. It takes as its syntax
the address where the character-set is
found. This address may be expressed
either in hexadecimal, preceded by a
"S" character, or in decimal.
For example, if you've designed a
font positioned in memory at S3F00
Hex, you can choose to use it with
the command R AMFON T $31;00.
Alternatively, if you have a character-
set in memory at the address $C000,
you could select it with either RAM-
FONT SCOGO(Hex) o r RAMFONT
49152(Decimal). Once you've ﬁnished
using a  character-set designed b y
yourself, you can go back to using the
standard Commodore font by execut-
ing the CBM FONT command.
MOVING M L E F T / M R I G H T /
MUP/MDOWN
It may have occurred to you when
using the TU R N , H ZE L IP  and
VTFLIP commands that it's some-
times a bit limiting to have text always
printed from left to  right i n  the
conventional manner. I f  your text is
facing towards the left, then it makes
more sense to print text from right to
left, or if the text is facing upwards,
from bottom to top.
You can choose which way text is
to be printed using the MOVING
command, followed by the direction
in which text should be printed. The
direction should be one o f LEFT,
RIGHT, UP and DOWN, and each
should be directly preceded with an
"M" for "Moving". This "M" is needed
to avoid clashes with the LEFTS and
RIGHTS functions of CBM BASIC.
Whichever direction PRINTEN is

printing in, it automatically takes care
of the wrapping of text from line to
line, and if a TEXT command causes
text to run off the screen, it simply
stops printing text on the last visible
character.

If you're using a  large number o f
special effects at one time, when you
come to turn them off again, this can
result in a large number o f BOLD
OFF, ITALIC OFF, UNDERLINE
OFF etc. Commands which are a bit
of a waste of time when you want
everything switched off. One solution
is to use an EFFECT 0 command, but
this doesn't reset the TURN function
or Font address. The answer is the
STANDARD command which simply
resets all PRINTEX's functions to
their Standard default values. These
settings are as follows:-

The FXHELP Command
When you're ﬁrst using PRINTEX, or
later when using the more advanced
feature, you may not be able to
remember the exact name of some of
PRINTEX's 20 commands. In such a
case, the solution is elementary, just
type EXHELP. The FXHELP com-
mand gives you a list of the PRINIFX
commands, as well as the tokenised
arguments they can take such as OFF,
STORE or MLEFT. This command
should be of great help when getting
to know PRINTEX.
PLUS 4 PROGRAMMING
USING COLOUR WITH PRINTEX
TEXT
That concludes our summary of the
PRINTEX commands. The next sub-
ject I would like to discuss is the use
of colour when printing text using
PRINTEX. This is simple to do, and
the process is shown below. Text
printed by PRINTEX is printed in the
current foreground colour on the
current background colour. These are
set-up using the standard C B M
BASIC COLOR command.
Example: Printing some te xt a
medium red colour on a bright yellow
background.
COLOR 0,8,6
(Set up Background colour)
COLOR 1,3,4
(Set up Foreground colour)
TEXT 1,1, "THIS TEXT IS RED ON
YELLOW"
Any one of the Plus 4's 121 colours
may be used for both background and
foreground colours.
Abbreviating PRINTTX
Commands & Keywords
In the same way that you can lessen
the amount of typing needed to enter
a BASIC command in standard Com-
modore BASIC by using abbrevia-
tions, you can abbreviate all the
PRINTEX commands and keywords
such as STORE or OFF. The full and
abbreviated forms of all PRINTEX
words are shown below.

Getting PRINTFX "Up &
Running"
The PRINTFX system is easy to
install, and may be used by either Tape
or Disk users. The process of poking
the machine-code data into memory
is simply a  matter o f loading and
running the BASIC LOADER pro-
gram (Listing I). The program will
inform you of any errors in the data
as follows:-
INVALID NUMBER IN LINE n -
One of the numbers in the speciﬁed
line is outside the valid range of 0-
255
CHECKSU M ERROR IN LINE n -
Each line of data contains a checksum
and this should be the sum of the other
numbers in the line. This error indi-
cates that either one of the data items
in the line is incorrect, or the checksum
number itself is wrong.
Once you get the message "STOR-
AGE COMPLETE -  D ATA 100%
CORRECT" follow the program's
instructions to  save a  copy o f the
working code onto a disk or tape. You
can then load PRINIFX by typing the
following:-
DLOAD "PRINTFX"
(For Disk Users)
or: LOAD "PRINTFX"
(For Tape Users)
RUN
A title message will appear at the top
of the screen, and the PRINTEX
commands will then be in operation.
Because PRINTEX uses the high-
resolution graphics screen, any print-

ing program should take the following
form:-
GRAPHIC 1,1 (to clear the screen)
or: GRAPHIC 2,1 (for a Split-Screen)
TEXT etc... (Do your PR INTEX
printing)
GRAPHIC 0 (Select Text mode
again)
END (R e tu rn  t o  B A S I C
[Optional])
The GRAPHIC 2,1 gives a screen with
graphics at the top and a small text
window at the bottom. I f  you don't
wish the screen to be cleared, omit the
",1". Some interesting effects can also
be generated using the multi-colour
graphics mode. To activate this, do
GRAPHIC 3 or GRAPHIC 4.
CI6 Owners cannot use PR INTEX
because on a  C16 with PRINTEX
installed there is exactly 2 bytes of free
memory left! However, if you possess
a CI6 with a minimum of 16k extra
RAM expansion, y o u  ca n  use
PRINTEX as i t  stands with n o
alteration.
In order to let you play around with
some of PRINTEX's special effects or
to generate simple screen displays with
the minimum o f  trouble, I  have
included a listing for a simple Screen
Editor. Using this program you can
use most of PR I NTEX's special effects
to quickly produce professional
screen-displays. The process for get-
ting this program running is shown
below.
DLOAD "PRINTEX"
(For Disk Users)
LOAD "PRINTEX"
(For Tape Users)
RUN
Type in the Screen Editor Program
(Listing 2)
DSAVE "PRINTEX &EDITOR"

SAVE "PRINTEX &EDITOR"
(For Tape Users)
RUN
Subsequently, you can use the Screen
Editor b y  loading &  running
PRINTEN then loading and running
“PRINTEX &EDITOR".
Upon running, after the Title

Protect yourself against
pirates with this ingenious
new program
By Neil Higgins
I
there have been many articles on
the subject of program protection
- indeed, I've even written one myself.
One thing they all had in common was
that they only described the simple
ways of protection, such as disabling
the run stop key, detecting a hardware
reset or even using a secret password
to prevent access to a program. These
methods worked well, but how can we
protect ourselves against the freezer
systems now used on the latest state-
of-the-art back-up cartridges? Well, in
this article I will explain one way in
which machine code programmers can
defeat such systems.
C64 PROGRAMMING d i
Eureka!
The most common cartridges for
the Commodore 64 at present have to
be'Action Replay', 'The Expert', 'Final
Cartridge' and 'Freeze Frame', all of
which have a built-in freeze button
which is supposed to be able to stop
any program while it is running and
make a back-up. If you have any of
these, then stay tuned! I was only able
to test my anti-freeze routine on two
versions of these cartridges - namely
the Final Cartridge 2  and Action
Replay MK 3, and in both cases it
proved highly successful.
Before I explain how to use the anti-
freeze, I will tell you how I ﬁrst came
across it. It all started when I  was
sitting around one day wondering
what my next project would be. After
an hour spent staring blankly at my
computer equipment, I  noticed my
'Action Replay' cartridge, and I had
a brainwave w h y  not try and detect
whenever the freeze button had been
pressed! But where on earth would I
start?
I decided not to  try using non-
maskable interrupts or other equally
precarious methods. I  thought there
would have to be at least one location
somewhere in memory that changes
whenever that button is pressed. Some
obvious memory locations to test were
around the CIA chips from SDC00 to
SDDOF, and the stack from S0100 to
$O I FF, so after a length of time around
the CIA s without getting anywhere,
I concentrated on the stack area.
Since 'Action Replay' is supposed
to have a system that leaves the stack
contents intact, I decided to ﬁll it with
a random byte (I ﬁlled $0100 to SO I FT
with $OO) and then run a routine which
would set the stack pointer. After
countless attempts a t pressing the
freezer and checking the stack, I ﬁnally

set the stack pointer to 25, then again
cleared the stack area and pressed the
freeze button, having entered the built
in monitor. I then noticed that location
$0103 had changed, and thus my anti-
freeze program was born.
Trying it out
The routine is given as a source code
listing which was written using the
Micro Assembler, but i t should be
compatible with most other assemblers
(you may just need to change the TXT
pseudo ops to BYT). A  basic loader
is also given fo r  those without
assemblers. To test i t on your car-
tridge, load it into memory and start
it with SYS 49152. A  message will
appear asking you to press the freeze
button, and after doing so you must
return to it by using the 'RUN' option
in your cartridge. I f  the test was
successful, the message 'I gotcha! You
have just used the freeze button 'will
be displayed, at which point you can
re-test to satisfy yourself that it works.
If it crashes on return, then you could
also call it successful, as it means a
working back-up cannot be made.
Machine coders can of course add
their own routines onto this, such as
ﬁlling the whole o f  memory with
random bytes, or even printing a silly
message to try on your mates. If you
do edit anti-freeze fo r your own
programs, it's important to note that
since the stack is reduced to 25, you
are severely limited as to the number
of nested subroutines or ROM routines
you can call. Also, check your usage
of the instruction PHA, in other words
keep an eye on the stack pointer.
The routine also needs to  use
location $0103. but this is also used
by certain rom routines - such as the
one at SFIDDD which converts the
contents of ﬂoating point accumulator
to a string starting at MOO -  so
if you intend to use the ROM: make
sure you know what memory addresses
are used, or it could be disastrous.
As there are new versions o f
cartridges coming onto the market
every few months. I can't tell you i f
anti-freeze would successfully work
with them. I hope you will try it out
yourselves, and if anyone out there has
already got all the latest ones, then why
not send i n  the results to  Yo u r
Commodore and demand they be put
in the Mailbag fo r us all to  see.
Anyway, I  hope anti-freeze helps
develop your own programs to star'o
out the pirates.

impressive feature you won't ﬁnd as an optional
extra is the LC24-10's versatile range of print
variations. All fonts come with the option of
shadow, outline and even shadowed outline to
turn all text into works of art.

Dragon
*Ninja
The game has obviously been programmed by the team
behind Target Renegade, and is a cut above the usual kung-
fu games. It combines fast action with good backgrounds
(such as a giant truck) which actually are part o f the
gameplay.
To improve your chances you can pick up and use
weapons the ninjas have used against you, which increases
your range but can cause you problems as it varies the
usual distance between you and your opponent to guarantee
hit.
This is one of the better kung-fu coin-op conversions
and you should be able to ﬁght your way through the ﬁrst
two levels by your second game, but reaching the seventh
may take longer.
S
enough to tackle Dragon Ninfa, or rather Bad Dudes
Vs Dragon Nit*, to give it its full title. Yes, here's
another attempt to beat the living daylights out of a motley
collection of opponents as you attempt to save the President
of the United States.
Controls are the usual, predictable walk, jump, kick and
punch moves with the addition of a super punch i f you
press and hold the ﬁre button for a few seconds to build
up strength. However, you are unlikely to have the time
to accurately move the joystick to select face kicks and
back elbows as you're swamped by ninjas, high-kicking
acrobatic women warriors and weapon-brandishing
minions.
If you manage to dispatch them you have to run the
gauntlet of the super villain positioned at the end of each
level who unlike the others that are killed with a single
punch has an energy bar next to yours at the bottom of
the screen and takes several blows to kill. The ﬁrst super Touchline:
villain you must cross ﬁsts with is a ﬁre-breathing giant, Title: Dragon Ninfa. Supplier; Imagine (Ocean), 6 Central

takes to the skies to defeat the Nazi hordes and rescue
the brilliant Professor and his beautiful daughter.
You've probably seen the series, you may even have read
the book, so now play the game and become Rocket Ranger!
The game begins in your lab in Fort Dix USA in 1940
- you're working on your latest invention when suddenly
a rocket pack, ray gun and decoder wheel mysteriously
appear in front o f you, warning that the Nazis have
discovered a fuel known as Lunarium and are set not only
to win the war but also to dominate the world for centuries.
Immediately, you realise that the equipment has been sent
from this potential evil future, and that you're the only
one who can stop it coming true.
Things suddenly take a turn for the worse when a deadly
Nazi Zeppelin lands and stormtroopers kidnap the brilliant
professor Otto Barnstoff and his beautiful daughter Jane.
You strap the rocket pack on your back and rush to the
rescue. Before you get carried away this isn't a simple bash
the bosche game, as it demands a combination of arcade
skill and strategy.
The strategy element is controlled from the war room
at Fort Dix, and involves issuing orders and receiving
reports from your team of agents in occupied Europe. These
agents can be ordered to either organise resistance to slow
down the Nazi war machine or inﬁltrate Nazi command
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
40
and gather information about their dastardly plans and the
location of secret bases.
But what of the professor and Jane I hear you cry?
Their fate will determine the effectiveness of the Nazi war
machine - they plan to ﬂy the unfortunate pair to Germany,
which will raise Nazi power from 50 to 75 per cent, and
then torture Jane with a mind machine until the Professor
agrees to be moved to the base on the Moon, which will
increase it to 90 per cent. This efﬁciency determines the
rate of Nazi conquest, and the time you've got left to save
the world.
Your ﬁrst task is to organise your agents to ﬁnd the
location of rocket labs, bases and bomb factories, and then
initiate resistance to slow down the Nazi advance. While
they're busy with that you can ﬂy off in pursuit of the
Professor, which will lead you into either a hijack attempt
on a Zeppelin, a dogﬁght with a squadron of Me109's or
a shoot-out with anti-aircraft (and anti-Rocket Ranger)guns
depending on how long it took you to ﬁnd them.
You then have to ﬁnd and attack ﬁve Nazi rocket bases
to steal parts to build your own ship (and plunder Lunarium
to fuel it), before blasting off to the moon and a ﬁnal battle
with an army of Nazi Zombie Women.
Unfortunately, your agents can be discovered and shot,
rocket pack fuel is in short supply, and Nazi guards and
Me109's aren't easy to beat, so the saving of the world
will be a heroic struggle. However, once you've taken to
the skies a  few times, you'll agree that this is best
Cinemaware games yet. Forget The Three Stooges,
Defender of the Crown and Sinbad - it's Rocket Ranger
that'll save the day!

ﬁghter and is capable o f quick take-offs, aerial
acrobatics and swift, deadly attacks. It's armed with
Phoenix long range missiles, Amraam mid range, sidewinder
short range missiles and a Vulcan cannon, and protected
by electronic counter measures, including chaff and ﬂare
launchers.
Before you decide that you've heard it all before, let
me add that there is a tough training program to endure
before you can even qualify for fast jets, and there are 80
missions to ﬂy once you do qualify. Once you've enlisted,
you have to complete a rigorous training schedule, but
luckily the program spares you the square bashing, so you
start by climbing into the cockpit of your training aircraft.
Throughout the exercises an instructor ﬂies in front of you
and gives you instructions, so it's a good idea to ﬁnd the
pause button so you can check what you're going to do
before he disappears from view.
The ﬁrst exercises are simple, and involve climbing to
set heights and banking to  speciﬁed headings before
returning to base. Then you move onto more complex
combat manoeuvres such as the Low-G Yo-Yo and the
Barrel Roll while still playing follow-the-leader. After the
eighth move, you're assessed on your performance and

which in most air forces means helicopters. If you should
fall short of the mark, a graphics sequence shows how you
continued to prove you couldn't ﬂy and ended up as a
wrestler known as Tomcat Tom. If you eventually succeed,
you'll be assigned to the Carrier Nimitz and sent on patrol
and work your way through the 80 missions, and hopefully
through the ranks and medals, until you ﬁnally retire.
Becore each mission, you're briefed as to the patrol you
are ordered to carry out, as well as the possible risks and
the rules of engagement. Then it's straight into action as
the bogies appear instantly on your scanner. In  some
missions, war has already broken out and you can shoot
at will. These tend to be the easiest as only you have Phoenix
long range missiles, so you can drop your speed and take
out the enemy without any risk.
Unfortunately, in most scenarios you aren't allowed to
ﬁre until either your commander gives you permission (very
rare) or the enemy ﬁre at you. The result is an intriguing
cat-and-mouse game, in which you try and warn the enemy
off while keeping them in your sights and you out of theirs.
This is where your training really pays off, as the enemy
ﬁghters (usually Migs) break and bank to try and get behind
you. Only then will they ﬁre. It's up to you to keep them
in check until they ﬂy off or risk a shot, when you can
ﬁnish them off with a couple of sidewinders.
Your Electronic Counter Measures warn you when an
enemy locks on to you, and ﬁres when it's up to you to
take the appropriate action and launch chaffs or ﬂares or
try and outﬂy them. When they're all destroyed, you return
to the carrier for a debrieﬁng.
Depending on your performance, you're either praised
or perhaps honoured with a medal, or chewed out for
disobeying orders (it's very tempting to blast a Mig when
it's right in your sights), which may lead to a review board
d some tough discipline.
F-14 Tomcat oozes quality, with its fast action gameplay
d quality graphics. What I particularly like is the attention
0 detail. For example, when you log in your name, it is
one on a form and the letters appear as i f they were a
gnature. This is deﬁnitely a high-ﬂyer.

WARLOCK'S
QUEST
en somewhere deep within an

of e 
u
 have to do is ﬁnd it. For some
unknown reason, y•
n
 only locate this bit of paste when
you have ﬁrst collec ed eight other random objects that
just happen to be lying around on the off-chance that some
day. some second-rate adventurer might just happen along
looking for them. You can just imagine He-Whose-Name-
Shall-Never-Be-Spoken saying "Aha! The entire power of
the world is in my evil clutches, unless some do-gooder
happens to collect the druid stone and ﬁre trident etc. I
know, Ill leave them out where he can ﬁnd them."
Thus it is that you wander about killing critters with
your faithful ﬁre-spitting wand (how can you have a faithful
wand? Is it called Fido?) picking up treasures, potions and
other useful objects. Beware though, some of the items are
cursed, whilst others simply kill you instantly. The caves
are on two levels, and you can move between the two by
means of a series of pits, ladders and teleports.
The caves load in different sections which are arranged
in a stupid order, necessitating having to backtrack across
the different loading zones. This is had enough on disk,
but I dread to think what it would be like on tape. A little
more care in positioning some of the dead ends could have
eliminated this problem entirely.
The graphics are dreadful a  cluttered screen ﬁlled with
tiny little characters. I  last saw graphics this size a few
years ago. The blurb describes the graphics as detailed and
witty th i s  is correct, they certainly made me laugh!
The top of the screen records your various stamina
points, as well as indecipherable blobs representing the
objects collected. There is also some sort o f multiplier
referring to your armour strength which goes up period-
ically. How signiﬁcant this is remains to be seen, as there
is no mention of it in the instructions. All in all, this game
is a mess. It would make a fair budget game, but at full
price, forget it.

the recovery of the aforementioned trinket and righting all
the %world's wrongs in one fell swoop.
riginating in the mid-Sixties, The Munsters have
now become something of a cult thanks to repeats
of the television series on Channel 4. A whole new
generation has come to enjoy the exploits of Herman,
Grandpa, Eddie, Lily and Marilyn. The Again Again
software house has managed to secure the rights for a
computer game and, surprise surprise, the game is actually
a reasonable representation of the TV series, unlike most
games of ﬁlms and TV shows.
The trouble with the Munsters is that they are too nice,
and so the Devil himself has decided that they must be
taught a lesson. His minions have kidnapped their Marilyn,
and 1313 Mockingbird Avenue has been invaded by a whole
host of ghosties, ghoulles and long-legged beasties, all intent
on hindering any rescue attempt.

The game starts with you in control of Lily, and your
ﬁrst task is to activate Grandpa and Herman. This involves
collecting a series of objects, but they must be picked up
in the correct order. Doing this requires a lot of backtracking
throughout the house, and you'll also need to make a couple
of visits to the graveyard.
There are two main types of monster, those that drain
all your energy away on contact, and those that don't! Your
problem is to ﬁnd a way of killing off the nasty monsters
in order to access different parts of the house and acquire
the objects needed to progress further with your quest. It
doesn't take long before you discover that you must ﬁrst
kill off large numbers of harmless ghosts in order to boost
your spell power sufﬁciently to have a go at the big beasties.
Naturally, attacking the harmless ghosts does not exactly
endear you to them, so they too start to drain away your
precious life-blood.
Once Grandpa has been activated, he must protect
Herman whilst together they locate Eddie. Then it's off
to the chateau where Marilyn is being held captive, but

The idea behind the game is simple. There are nine

to line yourself up with a ramp and time your jump just
right so that you land safely on the other side of the chasm.
Collisions with other cars just force you into a spin,
again slowing you down and using up fuel. The further
ou progress, the more crowded the roads become. There
are lorries carrying TNT which should be avoided at all
costs, as they too blow you off the road. Other hazards
that you might encounter include falling rocks, oil slicks,
holes in road and ﬂoating mines.
The amount of energy that your car can carry is carefully
calculated to make life as difﬁcult for you as possible.
Fortunately, you can top up en route. Energy pods ﬂoat
down on parachutes, and you can jump up to catch them.
Passing space ships drop three different types of capsule
to give you either bonus points, temporary invulnerability
or again, extra energy. The ﬁnal way to top up your fuel
supply is by driving over the jerrv cans strewn over the
road. Each one collected lights up one letter in the word
'energy' at the bottom of the screen.
One area where LED Storm scores over rival racing
games is that you don't have to go ﬂat out all the time.
Certainly, the faster you go the further along the track you
get, but i t does reduce considerably your chances o f
collecting anything in the road. Indeed, anything other than

are guaranteed not to stay on the course,
The graphics are pretty good, and there are some
excellent scrolling routines in operation, together with a
catchy tune. But all that only serves to add gloss to what
is already a highly addictive game.

remains to be done now is for Herman to work out which

A pretty fair rendition of The Munsters theme tune plays
throughout the game. Mo st o f  the characters are
recognisable, although a  bit lacking i n  detail and the
monsters look good. The main problem with this game
is that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that you
have to do things in. It's just a case of trial and error until
you ﬁnd out what works and what kills you. Even then,
you have to go through the same sequence of events every
time you play.
Flaying said that though, I  did ﬁnd The Munsters
addictive, and continued playing it long after I had intended
stopping. Deﬁnitely one of the better licensed tie-ins, and
a must for any Munster fan.

is in big trouble. Sure, he's a superstar Toon and
works every day at the Maroon Cartoon Studios
but he's just been framed for the murder of the cartoon
Gag King Marvin. To make things worse Marvin, who
owned Toontown, promised to give it to the toons, but
now not-so-funny business has reared its evil head and the
despicable Judge Doom looks set to cash in.
In a three part game based on the smash hit ﬁlm you
have to race in Benny's cab to the Ink and Paint Club,
ﬁnd Marvin's real will, slug it out with a weasel and ﬁnally
defeat Judge Doom to save Toontown.
Benny is a reckless cab driver, but your best bet to
reach the Ink and Paint Club before the Judge. The ﬁrst
part of the game is a race against time through the streets
of Los Angeles which are full of trafﬁc to halt your progress,
a battle to avoid pools of the Toon-dissolving dip that will
cost you one of your lives, and big reds (trams) which have
a similar i f more obvious effect. Luckily, Benny's car is
no ordinary vehicle and can leap with its accordion
suspension and even drive along the roof tops.
Eventually you will reach the Ink and Paint Club where
you must run around the tables collecting the papers that
the Penguin waiters put out while avoiding the grip of the
gorilla bouncer. You have to collect all the papers because
Marvin's will is written on one of them, but unfortunately
it's in invisible ink. Papers are collected by running around
the tables and pressing the ﬁre button at the right time.
If you mistime it you'll grab either nothing or a drink.
Toons and drink don't mix and so you'll lose valuable time
as Roger Rabbit ﬂips his lid under the temporary but
dramatic effect of the drink.
The next stage takes you back into Benny's car for a
last desperate dash to the Gag factory where all the cartoon

gags are made. These gags become your weapons as you
try and get the guarding weasels to laugh themselves to
death and so you wear glasses with springy eyes, throw
perma-slip bananas, cause a stir with itching powder and
make a quick escape through a portable hole.
Success will save Toontown and mark the end of one
of the most original games you'll play. It not only features
some neat animation but gameplay that actually does justice
to the ﬁlm.

where in Europe there is a top secret training
centre where only the most fearless soldiers come
to learn their trade and to earn their place in the
elite team known as the Cobra Commandos.
The centre is guarded by barbed wire and armed
wardens, and houses the toughest assault course ever used,
There are walls to climb, mines to hurdle, pipes to crawl
through, vicious guard dogs to avoid, enemy soldiers to
ﬁght in either unarmed kung-fu combat or with your trusty
repeating riﬂe.
All the time your progress is being monitored by the
instructors who make things as difﬁcult as possible for you,
and who deduct points for the slightest mistake. Fo r
example, enemy soldiers can only be fought i n  the
appropriate style unarmed soldiers cannot be shot or you'll
lose 100 points, which is disastrous as points are hard to
earn. If the instructors are feeling particularly vicious they
may order you to drop and do ten press ups at any time
during the course.
The course can be attempted in four different styles
which determine the type of challenge you will face. They
are physical (a lot of crawling), risk (avoid mines and handle
explosives), combat (hand to hand ﬁghting) or a mixture
of these. Whatever you choose it is a daunting task.
If you manage to complete the course then the game
includes a course constructor with which you can build
yourself a new challenge or set one for a friend.
Although the course is tough to complete and you have
different ways of approaching it, it does become repetitive
and would probably be better i f it was just the ﬁrst,
qualifying stage for a whole commando game complete with
assault and sabotage missions. As it is, it's little more than
a trial and error arcade game.

enjoyable, and became a big hit among thinking
garners. Now 824 has a sequel in the form of First Over

of B-17s in bombing attacks over Germany.
Such glories are a long way off when the game is loaded,

needed to command such a bomber, but they're short of
pilots so you're pressed into service. Your ﬁrst task is to
assemble your crew from those available t h i s  acts as an

you must take-off, ﬂy in formation and then land. Your
performance affects the health and safety of the crew, as
well as your chances of promotion. Eventually, you are
posted to Thurleigh airﬁeld, from which you will lead the
306th squadron in 25 missions over Germany.
The aircraft's controls are similar to those in B24, but
with a few additions. As well as controlling throttles, altitude
and direction, you also have to control the guns, manned
by the crew to ﬁght-off enemy ﬁghters as well as open the

atman and Robin, Laurel and Hardy and Tom and
Jerry. Everyone has their own idea of a partnership
that could be known as the Dynamic Duo. Firebird
has teamed up the most unlikely pair, as a duck and a
dwarf combine to break out of the Night House.
I suppose we have to be thankful that Firebird decided
against giving their cute heroes cute names, but nonetheless
we are stuck with a most unlikely pair of heroes. The
Dynamic Duo in question is lost in the dark-and-dingy Night
House, and they have to ﬁnd their way out against the
usual incredible odds.
The only way out o f the Night House is via the
calculation room. which can only be found once you've
collected ten parts of the room key. Unfortunately, these
keys are hidden in treasure chests somewhere in the house,
cing you to search it all. In the Night House, getting
one room to another is a far from simple task - you
to either walk through doors or climb down holes
in the ground, and to make things worse, some of the
corridors are blocked, requiring an engineered explosion
to clear the way through.
The Dynamic Duo can be controlled by two p l a y e l l

Now the bad news. Unfortunately, the game suffers from
a bad case o f line ﬂicker, and superﬂuous characters
sometimes ﬂicker just where you need to focus on your
controls. Anywhere else it would be a nuisance, but there
it renders the game almost unplayable.

dwarf), but can also ﬂy away to scout out the territory.
The dwarf moves slowly, but is the only one who can open
treasure chests. The only way to move them both to a new
location is to park the duck back on the dwarfs head and
then move the dwarf.
Throughout the game you are harassed by nasties that
can be shot by whatever weapons a duck and dwarf have
in common, but they continue to dog both your progress
and the little appeal this game has.

commands that may be useful
wrhen writing a program, it would
be surprising i f it consisted of more
than 20 items. Free Spirit Software
must have had a serious brainstorming
session to  squeeze every possible
function into Super Aide. The really
nice thing about it is that it principally
lurks under the ROMs, and doesn't
interfere with Basic memory at all.
Free Spirit has its roots in the vast
US Commodore User Groups, and this
is reﬂected in the software by virtue
of several public domain programs
being included to  run within and
beside Super Aide. The program itself
breaks down into several constituent
parts: DOS commands, programming
aids, 1 0  functions, and a miscellane-
ous collection of functions.
The DOS utility uses the conventional
preﬁx of the 'at' symbol followed by

the normal string command as used

A couple o f extra commands have
been added to the normal features, A
'hash' sign followed b y a  device
number greater than eight will direct
the computer's output to the corres-
ponding disk device. There is also a
'T' command which performs a cross
between the DUPLICATE and COPY
commands, and is equally useless to
the majority of users. Unfortunately,
the COPY command only copies a
program onto the same disk, but under
a different ﬁlename, while DUPLI-
CATE copies a whole disk on a twin
drive system.
With the 'T' command, a single
program is transferred from one disk
to another, but only on a dual drive

system, and only i f the second drive
has a  different drive number. A l l
commodore 1500 series drives have a
ﬁxed drive number of 0, and it's only
on the older 4000 twin drive units that
a drive value I was used, so on most
systems this facility is useless.
Apvrt from these minor niggles, the
DOS commands work well and save
a lot o f  unnecessary opening and
closing o f  ﬁles. Many programs
include these commands, even the free
wedge supplied with the drives, so there
is nothing really amazing about this
section, but it's essential for some sort
of DOS to be included, and this is as
good as any.
File Buddies
For loading and saving ﬁles, there are
no less than six different commands.
Using these, a load address can be
quickly retrieved from the disk, ﬁles
can be loaded from the directory
listing, and programs can be saved
with the minimum of effort.
A sequential text ﬁle can be read
to the computer screen or printed out
using a pound sign followed by the
ﬁlename, This is the most satisfactory
use, but the command also works with
program ﬁles, allowing lines to  he
grabbed and re-used wherever they
may be needed.
name. I f  a directory is listed to the
screen, this command can be placed
beside the printed out directory, and
when the RETURN key is pressed the
program loads to its correct location
in memory.
When any of the I/O commands
are used in conjunction with a direc-
tory display, the messages generated
are all printed on the same line. This
means that the actual loading process
does not affect the appearance of any
of the other directory entries, which
helps any future loads from the same
list.
Program Aids
Half a dozen essential commands are
available for program development.
These are all preﬁxed by an asterisk.
AU, followed by the starting line
number and the line increment,
initiates automatic line numbering.
Each time a program line is entered,
the next line number in the sequence
is printed out and the cursor place
made ready for the new commands to
be typed in.

V.drhen a program is being written
that will communicate with a printer,
it's often easier to write it so that the
PRINT statements are directed to the
screen. This can mean a laborious job
of changing all of the commands to
PRINT afterwards. Super Aide
contains a CHange command which
can make this job easier. This will
starch through a program for a given
string and change each occurrence to
the newly speciﬁed command. Sim-
ilarly, a  speciﬁc command can be
found using the FI command.
The DE command deletes blocks
of lines, and programs can be built up
in modular form by using the APpend
command. This adds a program onto
the end of any program in memory,
and then a ruNUmber command will
tidy up the line numbers and any line
jump commands where necessary.
Amazing Miscellany
Up until now, all of the commands
are useful but hardly earth-shattering,
and not really worthy of the iI4.95
price tag. A few hours with the relevant
copies of  Your Commodore and
anyone could knock it up for them-
selves. For me the strength of this
package lies in the miscellaneous
commands accessed by pressing the
RESTORE key. When the key is
pressed, the computer acknowledges
the fact by changing the border colour.
Any keypress that follows performs a
different function. All of these com-
mands are summarised elsewhere, so
the more notable inclusions will be
described here.
First and foremost is the special
listing facility accessed with the
upward pointing arrow. This is fan-
tastic, because it makes it unnecessary
to list programs. When the cursor is
taken to the bottom of the screen, the
C64/128 R EVIEW
ﬁrst line of the program scrolls into
view, and the scroll also works in
reverse when the cursor is taken to the
top of the screen. Being able to scroll
back and forth through a listing makes
debugging a lot easier.
Another debugging aid is a simple
Trace command which allows a pro-
gram to be run at a preset speed. A
small box at the top right of the screen
shows the current line number and
command being executed, while the
rest of the screen appears as it would
if the program was running normally.
Even if the fault occurs well into a
program, it can run at normal speed
until the point just before the problem
occurs and, because the RESTORE
button works on an interrupt, the
program can be halted with this key
and the trace initialised for fault
ﬁnding.
At any point a program can be
stopped and the current variable
values listed out, the length of a stored
program can be calculated beside the
start and end addresses, low resolution
screens can be dumped to the printer,
and the numbers can be converted
between any of the three common
bases -  decimal, hexadecimal or
binary.
Whenever one of these RESTORE
commands is called, the information
is printed on the screen, but the
original screen is returned when the
function is terminated.
Designing a low resolution gra-
phics screen is eased by one of the two
optional programs which can be
loaded with, and used from, the Super
Aide program. Full editing facilities
are allowed with this facility, and an
existing screen can be tarted up with
a few shapely graphics, or it can be
designed from scratch.
Once the masterpiece is completed,
a program to reproduce it is generated
which includes screen colours, other-

wise troublesome reversed characters
and upper and lower case selection.
One thing it doesn't do is to replace
the extreme bottom right hand corner
character with a  POKE to prevent
screen scroll-up when this line is
printed.
The second optional utility is the
well-known X  MON monitor, which
has been around in one form or
another since the early PET days. This
is a very good machine code monitor
which not only allows the usual
interrogative functions and disassem-
blies, but also has a memory move
routine and location modiﬁer which
adds to its usefulness.
The icing on the cake is the walk
facility, which allows the programmer
to run a coded program one command
at a time. As each line of code is
executed, a printout of the current
status of  the processor registers,
counter and status and stack states are
printed out alongside a disassembly of
the next command for execution.
What's Up Doc?
The documentation is rudimentary, to
say the least. The manual consists of
a printout of the help screens con-
tained within Super Aide itself and
therefore there is no contents page or
index. This doesn't make it easy to
become familiar with the system. An
example of the problems that this
causes is with two extra programs
which form Basic/code additions to
the Super Aide program, and deal
admirably with hi-res screen dumps to
the printer and disk doctoring. The
manual mentions that a hi-res dump
is on the disk, and perusal of the
directory eventually reveals the ﬁle-
name NON.CBM.HR.DUMP not  a
very friendly title.
The program menu shows that it

will dump images created with Simon's
Basic, UltraBasic 64, Doodle or Koala
Printer, which is all very ﬁne if you
own any of these programs - I don't!
There is also a standard hi-res dump
for other images, but there is no
documentation to say where the code
part of the program lies, so it is easy
to overwrite the code routine b y
accident.
I've had the program for a couple
of weeks, but fathoming how the dump
works took some time, and I initially
resorted to converting ﬁles from my
usual graphics packages (Rainbird's
Advanced OCP Art Studio and CRL's
Image System) to Koala format and
printing out the resultant ﬁle. For a
beginner without the resources o f a
good library, I'm  afraid that this
facility would be beyond them.
The disk doctor is easier to use and
performs adequately well. I t  allows
sectors to  be read from disk and
displays them on the screen. As the
cursor is moved along the sector bytes,
a display at the lower part of the screen
shows the screen character as a more
meaningful numerical value, and a few
C64/128 REVIEW
words describe the function of the byte
whether it be a sector pointer, ﬁlename
character or just a humble data bye.
Good though this utility is, it will not
seduce me away from my usual disk
utility, but for those without any form
of disk sector access, this is better than
nothing.
My ﬁnal gripe is that the Super
Aide program uses the RESTORE
key, which means that bailing out with
RUN/STOP and RESTORE is dis-
abled. This can be a problem i f the
program locks up in UDG or hi-res
mode, because you can neither read
any error message or get out of the
problem without resorting to the reset
button on the Cl28 or the even more
drastic power switch on the C64.
There is a second way to get out
of trouble if a syntax error occurs when
using hi-res or UDG modes. Super
Aide allows the function keys to be
deﬁned, so i f a series of reset com-
mands are stored on these keys, a few
presses will solve the problem. It would
be nice i f key deﬁnitions could be
saved, however, instead of having to
redeﬁne them at each power-up.

Conclusion
Despite its faults, Super Aide is a very
powerful utility which greatly facili-
tates program development. An y
features which aren't there (and there's
not many missing) can be stored on
the function keys.
The program utilities are all hidden
away under the ROMs, but the lo-res
screen editor is stored from 49152, and
the machine code monitor lies in the
higher reaches o f  normal Basic
memory. Fortunately, th e  p r o -
grammers had the foresight to realise
that a  user may wish to  use these
locations, so the routines are offered
as option extras which may or may
not be loaded at power-up.
I was very impressed with the range
of commands which this package
offers, and would certainly recom-
mend it to any programmer.

O
serious question everybody
was obliged to ask was, is it
Epson compatible? Nowadays, unless
you're buying a micro speciﬁc printer
(or an odd one) you can forget this
- virtually all printers conform to what
is now the accepted standard.
Given the overall improvement in
features and facilities you might think
there's no longer much to  choose
between one model and the next.
However, depending on the make and
model, you can still spend two, three
or even four times the amount for
essentially the same type of device to
do the same job. So what do you get
for your hard-earned readies, and what
justiﬁes the higher prices?
Of course no-one thinks the home
user who occasionally lists a program,
dumps a screen or writes a letter needs
the same printer as a  business
producing a couple of hundred receipts
a day, o r the school with a dozen
micros throwing listings at a single
network printer at the same time. The
fact is though, no-one wants to spend
more than necessary, and while
businesses or schools may have a larger
budget than the home user, it's often
more rigid too.
Twenty four pin dot matrix printers have become
a viable alternative to laser printing. But which
one should you buy?
By Robin Burton
Decision
Impressions conveyed by reviews are
inevitably subjective, and while most
try to  provide a  balanced view,
remember that your opinion is the
important one -  reviews are merely
pointers. For a large purchase like a
printer, you should always see and
compare several in your price range
before you decide. Buying a printer is
a serious business for most of us, and
a mistake can be expensive.
Separate the vital features from
those that would be a bonus. If you
have a very special application, you
might need to take a disc to your dealer
and ask to see the results from your
job. I f  the dealer is keen on service
as well as price, he won't mind. If you
buy from a 'box shifter' you may save
money, but ﬁnd that you pay for it
in lack of support later. Bear in mind
that most of us will expect our printer
to last for years.
While evaluating these printers, it
occurred to me that many potential
buyers would have been nine pin users
for perhaps several years, and might
be unaware o f  features that are
'standard' for 24 pin machines. A large
proportion of these facilities are quite
beyond the capabilities o f even the
most expensive nine pin models of just
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
72
a few years ago. Before moving on to
the individual reports perhaps a little
education is appropriate, especially if
you're unfamiliar with current printer
capabilities and trends.
Orientation
The most obvious additional feature
of most current printrs is the provision
of several I.Q font styles, usually with
the ability to add more. In addition,
many o f the combined print-mode
restrictions which apply to  older
printers (for example the inability to
use condensed and El i te  mode
together) no longer apply. In simple
terms, current printers have more
sophisticated internal software. This is
because some have moved to 16 bit
processors, whereas older printers used
eight bit controllers.
Buffer sizes are more generous
these days too, because R A M  i s
cheaper and three of the four here are
typical. Virtually all current 24 pin
printers also have commands for left,
right and fu l l  te xt justiﬁcation,
centring a line of text and tabbing to
a speciﬁed absolute position,
regardless of the current font or pitch.
The number o f  pitches too is
increased, 10, 1 2  and 1 5  being
standard, w i t h  expanded a n d

condensed modes on top of these, plus
the ability to  vary inter-character
spacing fo r all o f  them. Usually,
additional effects can also be overlaid,
like outline or shadow print, and most
can provide double height as well. You
can usually mix any o f these, but
condensed 15 pitch isn't possible.
Whether your printer control software
can handle all these print mode
combinations and effects is of course
a separate question, and one that
should also be considered if you expect
to be able to take advantage of all the
new facilities.
I feel that one other item has been
credited with more than it deserves by
some write-ups p u s h  feed tractors
are undoubtedly capable o f  more
ﬂexible and convenient operation, but
desirable though it is, 'paper parking'
has nothing to do with reducing paper
wastage. I f  printing must start right
from the top of a new page, as it always
does fo r fully formatted pages, i t
doesn't matter whether your printer's
tractor pushes or pulls. Contrary to
suggestions I've read, neither system
accommodates this need.
The only solution is to leave the
last printed sheet attached until you
start printing the next. Really the truth
is that most users want the convenience
of continuous paper, but actually print
only one or two sheets at a time. If
you print continuously the problem
doesn't exist, but if you don't, the only
perfect solution is a printer that moves
the paper up for tear-off, then moves
it back ready for the further output.
Such devices do exist, but not usually
at the sort of prices most of us would
want to hear about.
Evaluation
One area where subjectivity can be
eliminated is the speed a t which a
printer performs. The results for our
selection can be compared in the table
that follows. The tests were carried out
under identical conditions.
The test consisted of exactly 5000
bytes of this review, printed in Courier
at 10cpi b y all the printers. This
included a page throw with a one inch
top and bottom margin, blank lines
between paragraphs, but no headings.
It produced one-and-a-half pages of
typical text on standard I
at six lines per inch. I haven't quoted
manufacturers' ﬁgures, because they
have little or nothing to do with reality,
and they don't all seem to use the same
magical formula fo r  calculation
anyway.
PRINTERS
As an aside, I've often wondered
why there's no BSI test for printers,
or why performance claims are not
subject to the Sale of Goods Act. I've
had this particular bee in my bonnet
ever since testing my trusty FX80
many years ago. I found it couldn't
even print spaces at anything close to
its claimed speed (and in fairness the
FX80 was a lot nearer than many
others). The ﬁgures here are real, and
you can expect to  achieve them
yourself.
Samples of print are also illustrated
to show some o f  the styles, but
magazine reproduction, however
good, puts a limit on the validity of
this for personal judgement. Again,
always see (and hear) the real thing
yourself before you make your mind
up,
Two of the models, the LC24-10
and the LQ-500, are at the lower end
of the 24 pin price range, and must
compete head-on in the home-user
market. The bias towards this end of
the range is intended to reﬂect the
interest of the majority of readers.
On the other hand, if you've ever
wondered what higher priced printers
have to offer, (the ones that your dealer
doesn't stock and other magazines
don't review) read o n  a n d  b e
enlightened.

Star LC24- 10
Multi-font

he ﬁrst thing to strike me as I
unpacked the LC24-10 is how
extremely neat and tidy it is, There
are no bits and pieces sticking out, and
few to stick on, Preparation for use
involved installing t h e  ri b b o n
cartridge, pushing the carriage knob
on and plugging in. Unlike most
printers, the mains lead isn't separate,
it's permanently wired in and has a
moulded-on plug. Th i s  i s  ve ry
convenient, but the lead could be a
little longer, especially since it's not so
simple to change to a longer one.
S e tti n g  i t u p
The interface is Centronics (parallel)
and the lead plugs in at the rear of
the right side out of the way of paper.
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
73
Although not a problem for most uses,
it appears that there is n o  serial
interface, nor any other options.
The ribbon cartridge i s  th e
compact type which moves with the
print-head, and i t couldn't be easier
to ﬁt -  lift the top cover, place the
cartridge in position and press. I found
no need to touch the ribbon, so no
inky ﬁngers - excellent. It was so easy
I actually removed and replaced i t
twice just to make sure i t wasn't a
ﬂuke!
The LC24-10 also handles cut-
sheet paper, for which a separate paper
guide slots into place when needed.
Apart from the AS wire-bound 110
page manual there was nothing else
in the box - a good start! Construction
quality seems to be on the right side
of adequate. Neither the printer's case
nor its to p  cover suggest ﬂimsy
construction o r the need fo r over-
careful handling, and I  wouldn't
expect long-term durability o f  the
breakable bits to be a problem.
Control of the pre-set options uses
the familiar dip-switches, and these are
also accessed by lifting the top cover.
You don't need to disturb the printer
or paper to alter them, nor do you
have to be a contortionist, but they
are a little smaller and therefore more
ﬁddly than some. Setting the options
is explained clearly in a question-and-
answer style in the manual, and no
LC24 owner should be bafﬂed by these
(except for the print below).
The manual is quite well laid out,
with ASCII, decimal and hexadecimal
codes shown fo r  each command.
There's a  reasonable index and a
complete command list but in ASCII
code order, which is tine if you already
know the code that you're looking
for(?)! I was surprised that there was
no separate quick reference card, nor
is there a list of commands grouped
by function. As a  result, ﬁnding a
particular command usually involved
diving into the index, a minor but real
irritation, the novelty of which soon
wore off.
On the front of the printer, at the
left is the main power switch and at
the right a slot for either a replaceable
font cartridge or a RAM card. If you
use this for additional fonts, each card
provides an additional style, but the
manual contains no information on
what these are. Alternatively you can
plug in a battery-backed RAM card
which expands the printer's standard
7K buffer, though again the manual
doesn't say by how much.

Speciﬁcation
The LC24-10 provides both Epson
LQ-800 and I B M  Proprinter X24
emulation, giving the usual 96 ASCII
characters, o r  244 i n  IB M  mode
including graphics. Fourteen national
character sets are catered for.
From an initial check of the print
speciﬁcations and paper handling, I
rapidly formed the impression that this
printer w a s  thoughtfully a n d
comprehensively designed from the
beginning. Happily this was conﬁrmed
when testing began. Star seem to have
managed to  combine obvious style
with sensible, practical operation and
a remarkable range of print facilities.
Five fo n ts a r e  provided a s
standard, with italics available for all
of them. Other effects include outline,
shadow, double width, double height,
triple width and double or quad size.
One area which sometimes causes
problems for 24 pin printers is vertical
paper movement when used with
existing software designed for 9 pin
printers, but it's no problem for the
LC:24-10. Vertical spacing can be
controlled in either 180ths for 24 pin
software, o r  21 6ths fo r  nine pin
compatibility as you please.
Another notable 'extra' is that
vertical spacing can also be controlled
at twice the normal 24 pin resolution.
This means that, both vertically and
horizontally, you can produce dots at
360 per inch, a higher density that most
laser printers, although the LC24's
individual dots are obviously larger,
Using the Star
Continuous paper feeds through a slot
in the back o f  the printer and i s
controlled b y a  push-feed tractor.
When the paper runs out, a  small
portion of the rear of the ease lifts off
to make loading very simple. The rest
of the time there's no need to remove
the paper, even for a change to cut
sheet operation. Press a  couple o f
buttons and the paper automatically
parks out of the way, but still engaged
by the sprockets. Move the paper
release lever to its alternate position,
and cut sheets can then be used.
Cut sheet loading is also semi-
automatic. Drop paper in the guide,
pull the bail rod lever forward and the
paper is fed through leaving a one inch
prop margin. Put the bail rod back
and start printing. To resume contin-
uous printing is also easy. Move the
paper release lever back, pull the bail
rod lever and the continuous paper
feeds through again - then let the bail
rod lever go and start printing. It's
actually more difﬁcult to describe than •
do.
On the top at the front o f the
printer, there are four membrane-
covered micro-switches. Whether you
like membrane switches o r  not is
personal taste - I don't, but those on
the 1,C24-10 do operate with a satisf-
ying click, so at least you can be sure
of what you're doing.
One of these switches is on off line,
and with the other three in various
combinations all ﬁve font styles, with
or without italics and in 10, 12, 15,
17 and 20 cpi can be selected. Two
of the switches, i f pressed at power-
up, can also prevent either the type-
style and/ or the pitch from being
subsequently altered by software. The
usual line feed, form feed, self test and
hex, dump facilities are also provided
by these switches. Al l  this initially
sounds potentially confusing, but after
a minute or two it becomes quite clear.
Printing can begin about an inch
of the top of a page, and for continuous
paper the wastage when you tear off
is about an inch and a half. The tear-
off cutting edge would be better if it
were serrated. I found it necessary to
take when if a reasonably straight tear
was to be achieved. Print quality was
good fo r all the L Q fonts, unless
(unfairly) compared to the SQ-2500's.
I must say I wasn't very impressed by
the draft font though -  'adequate is
the most I can say about it.
Often 24 pin printers sound 'nast-
ier' than equal speed nine pin devices,
(more pins z more noise) but the LC's
noise level seemed about average, and
was quite acceptable. Unlike some
printers, the quality of the noise didn't
advertise itself too obviously as
emanating from a 24 pin device, but
like most printers, you wouldn't want
to stand next to it when making a
phone call.
The LC24-10 proved 100% reliable
throughout the test, and performed
precisely to speciﬁcation.
Conclusion
PRINTERS
The LC24-10 is an excellently designed
and very neat, compact printer. It has
eminently practical, easy to use facil-
ities, together with an unusually wide
range of fonts, print effects and sizes.
Eleven out of ten for effort, Star - it
shows.

The recommended retail price is
£399. Extra font cards are £49 and
RAM cards are £59, (all plus VAT,
giving E458,85, L56.35 and £67.85
respectively).
After a quick scan through current
magazines, I  found the LC24-10
advertised at around E290 plus VAT.
At this price, value for money isn't a
question. I f  you are buying an 80
column printer, the LC24-10 MUST
be high on your short-list.

Epson LQ-500

T
he ﬁrst job after removing the LQ-
500 from its box was to measure
it, I  was surprised that it's slightly
smaller in width and depth than the
Star, the square styling and greater
height are misleading. The height is
because the top-mounted tractor and
its cover are already ﬁtted. The ribbon,
paper feed knob and mains lead are
the o n l y o th e r ﬁttings needed
immediately.
Setting it up
However, there is a bit more left in
the box than the manual and a cut
sheet guide at this stage. The mains
lead is separate from the printer, and
perhaps importantly, it's longer than
the Star's. A  parallel interface i s
standard, but again in contrast to the
Star, the 230 page manual lists three
alternative serial interfaces, two IEEE
interfaces and two buffers, 32K and
128K, fo r both parallel and serial
connection.
The interface lead plugs in at the
rear, as does the power lead, and one
of the extra bits in the box is the paper
rest, an extension to the back of the
printer so that continuous paper can
be kept clear of the leads. The ribbon
cartridge is full width and ﬁts to the
printer chassis, not the print-head.
Fitting was quite straightforward
it's necessary to manoeuvre the ribbon
with a  pencil, ﬁngers or something
similar. As the manual suggests, it's
easier if the print-head is moved to the
centre to do this. The remaining parts
consist of the cut sheet paper guide

and its top cover.
Quality o f construction is very
good -  the case and both covers are
distinctly robust. I  noticed as I
inspected the printer that there was no
bail-rod. Quite neatly, Epson have
dispensed with this and built deep ribs
into the acrylic covers to keep the
paper against the platen, while at the
same time increasing the strength of
the covers.
Because th e  tra cto r i s  to p -
mounted, the minimum distance from
the top of a sheet to the ﬁrst print
line is about 2.75 inches. Also there's
no tear-off facility with the tractor
unit, except the perforations in the
paper. To  remove a  printed sheet
always involves the loss of about half
a page, unless you wind the paper
back.
The LQ-500's dip-switches are
located under a removable cover on
the right o f the printer towards the
rear. They're easy to reach and nothing
need be disturbed to do so. Control
of all the usual pre-sets is provided,
and this manual too adopts a question
and answer system to help setting up
(but see also the self-test feature
below).
I altered two switches from the 'as
delivered' state, one to select 11 instead
of 12 inch paper, the other to enable
the 8K buffer rather than download
deﬁnitions. The manual doesn't give
information on downloadable capac-
ity. One o f four extra fonts can be
added by inserting a font cartridge
next to the dip switches, out of sight
under the same cover,
The ﬁrst 50 pages of the manual
contain a thorough guide to setting up
followed b y another 50 pages on
general use and trouble-shooting, so
even ﬁrst time users should have few
problems. Control codes are given in
ASCII, decimal and hexadecimal
form, with direct keyboard versions
too where possible. Each command is
also accompanied b y a  generous
explanation where necessary.
The manual's contents list is rather
more thorough than the Star's, and
there's also a glossary of terms, as well
as a fair index. Commands are sum-
marised both by name and task, which,
with the tear-out quick reference card,
ensures that locating an unfamiliar or
seldom used command is easy.
Speciﬁcation
The LQ-500 is, o f  course Epson
compatible, and the IBM block gra-
PRINTERS
phics characters between ASCII 128
and 255 are included, together with
accented and Greek characters and
some maths symbols. IBM emulation
is n o t  supported. Th e  manual
acknowledges this and offers some
suggestions for setting up DOS soft-
ware, but while most recent DOS
software caters for Epson printers, old
software may not. In  this case the
bottom line is you may have trouble.
13 national characters sets are
supported,
Three fonts are provided as stand-
ard, each of course with italic versions.
Additional effects are outline, shadow,
double width and double height. All
fonts are available in 10, 12 and IS
pitch, and all can be condensed, except
15 pitch. Vertical spacing is controlled
in IJI8Oths o f an inch, while the
minimum horizontal movement is 1/
360th.
Using the Epson
Continuous paper feeds over the back
of the printer, and must be pushed
round the platen and o n  to  the
sprockets by hand. The process isn't
as ﬁddly as i t sounds, but since a
change to cut sheet means removing
both the paper and the tractor unit,
it's just as well.
Both the tractor and its top cover
are simple to remove, and the paper
guide covers are as easy to ﬁt, but it's
not the sort of job you'd want to do
every few minutes. Whether this is a
problem to you only you can decide,
but I  suspect that i n practice the
average user doesn't actually change
stationery very often. Loading cut
sheet paper is semi-automatic. Drop
a sheet in the guide and with the printer
still on-line, press the line-feed button
and the paper feeds through. In cut
sheet mode, pressing the form-feed
button ejects the printed sheet when
you reach the bottom.
On the top at the right side of the
printer are three buttons - the rear one
is on,' off line, and the other two
provide all manual control. With the
printer on-line, repeated pressing of
the form-feed button cycles through
the available fonts, including the one
provided by the cartridge i f  ﬁtted.
Pitches can't be changed b y these
buttons, but must be pre-selected by
dip-switch or altered by software.
Line feed, form feed, self-test and
hex, dump are also provided by these
buttons, but the self test has an
excellent extra. In addition to fulﬁlling
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
75
its obvious function, all the dip-switch
conﬁguration options are printed, with
the current selections highlighted by
emphasised print, so even if you aren't
conﬁdent about setting dip-switches,
checking what you've done is done for
you. A nice touch.
Print quality was good -  the
standard 'Roman' font (unique to
Epson, I  believe) looks particularly
clean and clear. Using 10 pitch Courier
(provided by cartridge) for a direct
comparison, th e  LQ-500's p ri n t
seemed to me slightly clearer than the
LC24's, with, for example, the letter
'0' a fraction larger (or is it rounder?).
In truth, if there is any difference it's
not much, so I  asked my wife to
compare a page of each (without any
other information) and she could see
no difference between them. This is
obviously an area where subjectivity
reigns supreme, so judge for yourself.
One font where the LQ did have
a deﬁnite edge was in draft mode.
Draft on the LC24, though quite
legible, was inferior. This probably
explains the LC's slight 'catching up'
in the draft speed test compared to LQ
(see table). I'd guess that in the interests
of ribbon life and print speed many
home users would operate in draft
mode most o f  the time, so don't
underestimate the importance of this
- make sure you compare them. The
LQ's draft was much more a  'real'
typeface, and I found it more pleasant
to read.
The noise level from the LQ-500
was OK, certainly no more than the
LC24's, Given that, at least on my test,
the LQ's draft print was about 6%,
faster and letter quality II% faster than
the LC24, you'd reasonably expect a
little more noise. The fact that there
isn't might reﬂect the LQ's slightly
heavier construction.
The L Q  performed faultlessly
throughout the test.
Conclusion
The LQ-500 is Epson's bottom-of-the-
range 24 pin printer. It is very solidly
built and simple to use, though the
paper handling distinctly shows its age,
This might be' unacceptable i f you
swap stationery frequently. While not
providing such a range of fonts and
controls as the LC24-10, all the
'standard' 24 pin facilities are present,
and these would be quite adequate for
most uses.

In some areas the LQ-500 has the
edge. For special applications needs
there is a  wide range o f interface
options. I f  output speed and draft
quality are important factors, the LQ-
500 might be preferred.
The recommended retail price is
E399, and extra font cards are £55.
(E458.85 and £63.25 including VAT).
Again checking recent magazines
produced a different story, and I found
the LQ-500 frequently advertised for
about kW to E15 less than the LC24-
10.

Citizen 1
1
he HQP-45 is a  wide carriage
printer, so the ﬁrst job was to make
space for it. The remaining contents
of the box were the mains lead, the
ribbon and two manuals.
Setting it up
Both the paper feed knob and the cut
sheet guide are already ﬁtted. After the
sound cover and the paper cutter have
been removed (both smoked acrylic
top-covers), transit packing was
removed from the print-head and the
full-width ribbon (all 18 inches of it)
was ﬁtted.
Surprisingly. Citizen haven't opted
for a compact cartridge for a printer
of this width. I found ﬁtting slightly
awkward, both because of its size and
because full width ribbons tend to be
more awkward anyway. The mains
lead is separate and plugs in at the
rear of the printer, as does the parallel
interface cable. A serial interface is also
provided as standard, and this is on
the right side towards the rear. No
other interfaces or buffers are listed.
The HQP's styling is very individ-
ual and quite elegant. I'm not sure why,
but I  couldn't help thinking that i t
would look good through a high street
travel agent's window. A t the same
time, I also thought the sharp corners
were not such a good idea. They might
be painful if you knocked your hand
on them, and they might get damaged
if something solid were to bang into
them.
Neither the printer's case nor the
PRINTERS
covers inspired impressions of dura-
bility, made worse, no doubt, by their
large size. I always felt a need to take
care when lifting o r replacing the
covers. To be honest, I can't imagine
them lasting very long in a school or
similar environment.
As a result o f this impression I
checked, and wasn't very surprised to
ﬁnd the HQP at 16.5 pounds weighed
only a pound more than the much
smaller (80 column) LQ-500, and more
than eight pounds less than the wide
carriage SQ-2500. I  know that you
don't buy printers by the pound_ but
there must be a message here.
On the front, at the right are four
push-switches to  control manual
operation, and immediately below
them is a  drop-down ﬂap which
conceals the dip-switches. I n  this
position they are very easy to reach
and nothing needs disturbing. Control
of all the usual options is provided,
but somehow Citizen have managed
to spread them over four banks of eight
— 32 dip-switches. It's certainly a record
in my book.
Bank three is mainly concerned
with the serial interface, but I  still
expected to see lots of extra options
there aren't any. There is more
confusion though. First, which man-
ual? Reference Manual? Wrong, the
User's Guide, As to the switches, in
the manual switch 1-2 is explained as
'Automatic Line Feed by CR code'
with options 'Yes/No', switch 2-3 is
shown as 'Automatic CR' with options
'Yes/no'. If that hasn't confused you
switch 2-6 is labelled 'Automatic Line
Feed by full column' with options
'CR+LF/ CR only'!
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
76
There are other examples. Switch
I-1 is 'Epson emulation on off' but a
note for bank four says 'When SW4-
8 off, Epson Conﬁguration' and while
switches 4-1 to 4-3 select international
character sets, 4-8 really selects 'Scan-
dinavian Character See!! Confused
now? I was. There is a 'maintenance
self-test' which prints out the settings,
but it only shows a I or a 0 to show
if a switch is on or off (1) unlike the
LQ-500, which interprets the settings
for you in English and shows the other
option too.
I'm supposed to know something
about printers, but i t took me two
attempts to turn the printer's line feed
off. Keeping a sense of proportion, this
is usually a one-off job, but while the
manual is clearly laid Out, in this area
it just doesn't explain itself. As a ﬁrst
job and the introduction to the HQP-
45, it wasn't very endearing.
It turns out that the Reference
Manual (60+ pages) contains the
software commands, while the Users
Guide (80 pages) is everything else,
including speciﬁcations, character sets,
print examples and the quick reference
card. Most things are quite well laid
out and with good explanations
(except for the lack of decimal control
codes and the dip switch section), but
splitting the material into two manuals
is a mistake, and the names don't help.
It seems the information you want
is always in the 'other' manual (and
of course you can't ﬁnd it). It's a nice
idea but it doesn't work. The problem
is aggravated by the fact that, in both
manuals, although all the sub-topics
are listed on the contents pages, only
the ﬁrst page number of each chapter

is shown. Even when you ﬁnd the right
chapter, you must still hunt through
it. I thought perhaps I was being dense,
but other reviewers have had the same
problem.
One excellent feature is the HQP's
unusually large print buffer of 24K,
and this can be split into 16K for
download deﬁnitions and still leave an
8K print buffer, ﬁrst class. The manual
doesn't gives download capacity in
either mode.
One extra font can be added by
means of a font card which slots in
under a cover on the right to the rear
of the machine. The manual doesn't
show what other fonts are available.
A second slot i s provided fo r an
emulation card, giving software com-
patibility with Diablo or Qume prin-
ters, o r an IBM Proprinter. Other
emulations are implied, b u t n o t
speciﬁed.
A six page addendum sheet was
included with the User's Guide. This
contained many corrections and addi-
tions (some quite signiﬁcant so really
there were three places to look), and
three more pages of index, doubling
its size. I had already thought that the
manual was a  'rush job', and this
conﬁrmed it. I t  isn't good enough
when you're spending several hundred
pounds.
Speciﬁcation
The HQP-45 is Epson LQ-1000 com-
mand compatible, but as standard
none of the IBM graphics, Greek or
accented characters or maths symbols
are included. Nine national character
sets are provided.
Courier is the sole font. Font cards
are necessary i f additional styles are
required, but only one can be used at
a time. Italic is of course included, and
LQ, draft and 'correspondence quality'
(halfway between draft and LQ) are
available. Enhanced print effects are
inverse print, available in 10 or 12 pitch
only, and double height. Neither o f
these use the standard Epson com-
mands, but instead have unwieldy
'Citizen Escape sequence'.
The usual 10, 12 and 15 pitch are
provided, and both 10 and 12 pitch
can be condensed. Vertical spacing is
controlled i n  180ths o f  an inch,
horizontal movement in 360ths.
Using the Citizen
Continuous paper is fed by a push
tractor, but paper parking isn't pro-
PRINTERS
vided, and isn't possible manually
either, because the tractor drive can't
be disengaged. A paper cutter allows
short tear off. Use of continuous paper
is very awkward unless the cut sheet
paper guide is removed, because i t
hides the sprockets for loading and
also gets in the way o f the paper
coming out again.
Swapping to cut-sheet paper isn't
very convenient either. The sound
cover must be removed and put aside,
the paper guide then lifts up from the
rear and locks in position. In theory
that's it, and loading cut sheets is semi-
automatic. Place a sheet in the guide
and the printer feeds i t through,
triggered by a micro-switch. In practice
the sheet is often 'grabbed' before
you're ready and before it's quite
straight, with the result that several
attempts might be needed.
When the paper does go in straight,
the vertical position isn't consistent to
within half an inch, so manual adjust-
ment is also needed (Even the User's
Guide says adjust ' i f necessary).
Unfortunately the remaining top
cover, the paper cutter, must now also
be removed so you can see the paper
to make the adjustment. This perman-
ently lets you in for the full blast of
the H Q P ' s  n o i se , w h i c h  i s
considerable.
On the front of the printer are four
buttons. The right one is on/ off line,
and the other three provide manual
control. Second from right is the form-
feed/ line-feed, th e  th i rd  selects
between the fonts (if ﬁtted as extras)
while the left button cycles the options
of draft, correspondence quality, letter
quality and proportional.
To the left o f  this are LEDs
conﬁrming the current selection, but
the screening between them isn't
sufﬁcient and light spills from one to
the next. The separate paper-out light
shows permanently, so until you get
used to them these aren't very helpful.
Line feed, form feed, self-test and hex.
dump are also provided by the buttons.
Print quality was acceptable for
letter quality or draft, but was not
thought to be as good as the LQ-500's
by anyone I showed sample to. I'm
not sure what purpose 'correspon-
dence quality' serves. It's little better
than draft, certainly not good enough
for correspondence, and seems rather
superﬂuous. I  think higher quality
draft mode would be an accurate
description.
Noise levels from the HQP-45 were
totally unacceptable. It was unplea-
YOUR COMMODORE may 1989
77
santly loud with both covers in place,
but when used for cut sheet (which
demands your presence and the
absence of both covers, see above) it
was stunning. A  conversation with
someone in the same room was an
effort, never mind by telephone. The
HQP's speed was not much higher
than the LQ-500's, and by no means
enough to justify or excuse the volume
of noise.
There were two worrying points.
I noticed that characters printed in
draft were, on alternate lines, quite
noticeably displaced to the right or left,
depending on which way the print-
head was travelling at the time. This
is another 'ﬁrst' for me, and together
with the noise levels suggest that both
the printhead and its strobe timing are
being pushed harder than they want
to go. Time will tell.
The second and more serious worry
was that, even with the printer power
switch in the off position, when the
mains lead was inserted there was a
distinct electrical 'ﬁzz', the source of
which I don't know.
Conclusion
Citizen's HQP-45 is the wide carriage
cousin of the HQP-40, their SO column
24 pin printer. On the plus side the
styling is quite striking, and the
unusually large print buffer is very
welcome.
Construction may prove adequate
over time, but i t  doesn't inspire
conﬁdence, although there is a two
year warranty. In places the manuals
will leave new users ﬂoundering. The
reliability of cut sheet paper handling
is not acceptable -  it's a good idea
which in practice is a liability. The
volume of noise is impressive, but for
the wrong reasons. Provision of only
a single font coupled with the lack of
the expected 24 pin extras simply isn't
good enough.
The recommended retail price is
E699 and extra font cards are E35.
(E803,85 and E40.25 including VAT).
I'm quite bafﬂed b y Citizen's
pricing policy. I have found the HQP-
45 advertised for E310 plus VAT. One
could almost believe the recommended
price (obtained from Citizen 15112/
88) is intended to make the printer
appear to belong to a higher speciﬁ-
cation category than it deserves. I can't
for a moment recommend it.

keyboard having just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one o f  the superb programs from Your
Commodore. Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press
the letters R, U and N. You press RETURN, sit back and
nothing happens.
- Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little but slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and
disk at a price o f £6.00 for disk and L4.00 for cassette.
None of the documentation for the programs is supplied
with the software since it is all available in the relevant
magazine. Should you not have the magazine then back
issues are available from the following address:
INFONET LTD, 5 River Park Estate, Berkahmsted, Herts,
HP4 IHL.
Tel: (04427) 76661
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions, i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus making use of the programs much easier. Unfortunately
at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and Plus/ 4 cassettes.
However programs for these machines will be available on
the disk.
What programs are available?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type, C64 Program etc. So that you can see
which programs are available on which format, you will
also ﬁnd a couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols
have the following meaning:
This symbol means that the program is available on cassette.

Readers Problems
Though the Commodore 64 is one of
the world's most popular microcom-
puters, it can be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd
speciﬁc information about your
particular machine.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we
receive literally hundreds o f letters
from you, our readers, on a wide range
of subjects ranging from the simple
Can you give me the telephone
number for...', to the more complex
'I'm trying to write a program that uses
a split screen. How do I do it?'
Unfortunately, the volume of mail
received has become so great that it
is impossible to answer every letter and
still manage to publish a  magazine
each month.
For this reason we have felt i t
necessary to  produce a  number o f
guidelines fo r getting information
from us:
.
every letter sent to  the magazine.
Should i t  become apparent that a
number of readers are suffering from
the same problem, then we will reply
to the letter via the Letters page.
2) A new helpline has been set up. This
will be open fo r your queries on
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
between 2.00pm and 4.00pm. We will
not be able to deal with our telephone
queries at any other time. If our tech-
nical adviser is not available when you
ring, then a message will be taken.
3) If you are having problems with one
of our listings, can you please let us
know in writing. This will enable us
to see if a number of people are having
the same problem. When a common
problem becomes apparent with a pro-
gram, then a correction sheet will be
issued. Enclose a  self-addressed,
stamped envelope and we will send you
a copy of the correction sheet as soon
as it is available.
We are sorry that it has become
necessary to instigate these rules. How-
ever, we are sure that you will agree
svith us that the more time that we
can spend making Your Commodore
the mo st informative magazine
around, the better.
