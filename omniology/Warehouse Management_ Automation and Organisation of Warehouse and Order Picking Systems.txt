Foreword
Modern warehouse and distribution systems constitute highly complex nodes
within the value-added chain and have to meet a variety of requirements with
regard to time, costs and quality. The eﬃcient operation of such a system is
a continuous and great challenge for anyone in charge. Recent developments
of advanced computer and control technologies have provided the necessary
control and management systems (warehouse management systems, WMS).
Nevertheless, due to the high complexity, users often ﬁnd it hard to handle
these kinds of systems.
Because of the large variety of solutions and system requirements the
design, choice and operation of a WMS requires extensive know-how and ex-
perience. Many aspects have to be considered and implemented which dictate
whether the system will succeed or fail.
The purpose of this book is to give the reader an overview over possible
solutions and help him to make the right choice. It presents background
information, examines not only the potential, but also the risks and strategies,
and thus sets the basis for comparisons for all those who are responsible for
the choice and speciﬁcation of warehouse management systems. Furthermore,
it is meant as basic support for students of logistic sciences and interested
beginners who would like to become acquainted with the subject. This book
is related to practice without neglecting the basic context or implying special
technical knowledge. The basic processes and technologies that are required
for a better understanding are described in detail.
In addition to this, the book will give system developers new ideas by
pointing out the problems and limits of current developments and oﬀering
new approaches with regard to the structure and design of WMS.
As an attachment, you will receive a simple, but functioning and well-
documented WMS, taken from the Open-Source Initiative myWMS. Thanks
to the simulation environment, the software can be operated on a standard
PC, independent of the platform and without the otherwise obligatory user
login data. Thus, the operation, function and beneﬁts of a WMS can be
visualized.
This book could not have been written without the dedicated support
of an experienced team. We herewith want to express our gratitude to (in
alphabetical order):

Foreword
Hubert B¨uchter, for his basic consideration concerning the design of ware-
house management systems,
Ulrich Franzke, not only for his engagement, but also for his valuable contri-
butions in the area of ident systems,
Dirk Liekenbrock, the optimal expert with regard to control and optimizati-
on, and
Oliver Wolf, Mr. Warehouse-Logistics, for contributing to this book with his
experience gathered during the Warehouse Logistics project.
This book certainly would not have been possible without the constructive
and helpful cooperation of a multidisciplinary team of experts.

1. Introduction
Warehouse management is the art of operating a warehouse and distribution
system or, better still, of operating it eﬃciently. Excellent logistic perfor-
mance can open up new markets while customers expect speed, quality and
minimized costs. Warehouses and material handling systems are the core ele-
ments within the goods ﬂow and build the connection between producer and
consumer.
The activities related to storage and goods distribution can only be ful-
ﬁlled by a warehousing system which is tailor made for the speciﬁc require-
ments and consists of
– the basic technical structure,
– the operational and organization framework and
– the coordinating system control.
Aspects concerning the planning of the technical system structure, for
example, are the system layout, the choice and dimensioning of convey-
ors and warehouse components and the design of the physical interfaces to
neighboring systems. These problems are discussed in various publications
[4, 29, 40, 54, 72, 73, 80] and will be considered in this book only as far as
they are relevant for the system control.
The operational as well as the logistic organization combine various as-
pects from diﬀerent areas (business management, organization, transporta-
tion). This book mainly focusses on the eﬃcient use of existing resources. As
far as speciﬁc business problems or the design of interplant logistic structures
are concerned reference is made to relevant literature [44, 62, 98].
An eﬃcient warehouse management represents an expert know-how com-
prising the exact knowledge of the necessary processes, the technically and
operationally feasible as well as the successful implementation into a function-
ing overall system. However, there are no generally applicable and universal
rules for achieve this goal. The requirements resulting from the customer’s
ordering pattern, the attractiveness of the products and services, the produc-
tion requirements and many more are much too diverse.
The design and realization of the control and management system is of
special importance. While technical systems and mechanical components are
planned just once or in the scope of an extension or optimization, the system

2
1. Introduction
control has to deal with one-time aspects of the system design and imple-
mentation but also with the continuous dispatch during the operation of the
warehouse and distribution system. This calls for the permanent supervision
and control of the processes and their continuous adaptation.
A look at the performance data of current warehouse and distribution
systems soon reveals that the complexity (scope and dynamics) of the pro-
cesses can practically be mastered only by means of computer-aided manage-
ment systems. The multi-functional control systems, on the other hand, also
become ever more complex and diﬃcult to use. For this reason it is very com-
plicated to ﬁnd a suitable system and to adapt it to existing requirements.
The number of suppliers of logistic control systems is legion as is the variety
of designs. For this reason, it is nearly impossible to evaluate the systems on
the market.
Another hurdle to be taken is the faultless implementation of the system.
Above all delays during the start-up and business interruptions not only cause
considerable costs, but also bear risks like a shift of customers, a negative
market image or recovery claims what may jeopardize a company’s medium
or long-term business success. What is decisive is to ﬁnd a suitable and highly
available system.
This book not only deals with the question of how to design warehouse
and distribution systems, but also of how to coordinate their operation. It
wants to provide the reader with the necessary knowledge and tools, give him
an overview, describe standards and help to avoid mistakes.
1.1 Requirements
Prior to giving a detailed description of the aspects of warehouse management
let us have a look at warehousing and goods distribution.
1.1.1 Warehousing
Although the term warehousing raises negative images like high costs and
non-value-adding times, in practice most branches are bound to store their
goods for various reasons. A distinctive feature from a logistic point of view
is the fact that this is a planned process to bridge over time and status [40].
Some important reasons to implement and operate warehouse and distribu-
tion systems along multi-level supply chains are:
Optimizing the logistic performance: A basic customer requirement is
the immediate fulﬁlment of an order. Since the time of the order entry
and the ordered quantity cannot be forecast exactly for the vast amount
of articles the ﬁrst approach is to keep a forecast quantity of goods in
stock, which can also be described as ensuring the readiness to deliver.
This is a justiﬁable process especially in case of a large distance between

1.1 Requirements
3
the sites of production and consumption and possibly custom clearance.
Distant markets sometimes can only be opened up with warehousing.
A growing variety of goods and articles, a trend towards the more fre-
quent ordering of smaller lots and the call for ever shorter delivery times
make logistic services a decisive criterion for the choice of a supplier. By
operating a goods distribution center powerfully and eﬃciently, a com-
pany can achieve, assert or improve its market position.
Of course, stockkeeping requires continuous supervision of stocks and
optimization of the ordering patterns in order to avoid too large stocks
or too long a storage time.
Ensuring the productivity: Production chains that are designed for a
just-in-time delivery, and thus work with minimized stocks along the
supply chain are highly sensible to disturbances. This was demonstrated
in recent years when complete production lines in the automotive indus-
try broke down due to border blockades caused by angry lorry drivers or
due to strikes in external supplier plants. Therefore, one of the main rea-
sons for stockkeeping is to ensure the supply of the expensive production
levels.
Providing additional services: Customers no longer just require the short-
term provision of single products or articles. On the one hand, the variety
of products grows in nearly all areas, and thus the product range - driven
by product marketing. One method to keep costs low is to ﬁnish the pos-
sible variants as late as possible by using just a few basic elements. These
assembly services are more and more oﬀered in goods distribution centers.
On the other hand, ﬁnished products can also be supplied via specialized
distribution channels, e.g., by attaching sales information (labels, etc.)
or by promotion activities.
Reducing transport costs: One of the main reasons for stockkeeping is
the attempt to reduce transport costs and to achieve ﬁxed-step transport
costs by optimally utilizing the loading capacity (complete loads).
This also requires optimized handling processes in the goods receipt and
goods issue. Generally, it is much less eﬃcient to handle a large number of
small lots than the consolidated total so that existing capacities (number
of gates, switching space, etc.) can be utilized much better. Especially
the retail trade lacks the capacity to handle frequent deliveries (staﬀand
gates) so that customized delivery quantities have to be collected at these
interfaces.
Balancing required and delivered quantities: Although the market has
long since changed from a seller’s to a buyer’s market and thus to a
demand-driven production (pull systems), many branches still have to
produce appropriate lot sizes.
In production the single phases are characterized by diﬀerent process
times and output quantities or irregular inputs and outputs between the
areas. In order to avoid idle times semi-ﬁnished products have to be

4
1. Introduction
buﬀered to ensure the consistent utilization of the production plants and
processes.
Furthermore, certain production processes are subject to regularities
which cannot be inﬂuenced (e.g., cooling processes, growing of pharma-
ceutical cultures, etc.) and which thus do not correspond to the contin-
uous or sporadic demand.
Many business ﬁelds are subject to considerable seasonal ﬂuctuations
which cannot be absorbed by just adapting the production capacities.
Using the market position: Warehousing induced by quantity discounts
is a classical costing problem and is described by a quantitative degression
on the supplier’s side and other costs like administration costs (execution
of orders, price negotiations) on the other side.
Warehousing as a process step: For some products or processes ware-
housing represents an elementary value-adding process or increase (e.g.,
by maturing of speculative intent) and thus becomes part of the produc-
tion process.
According to this list, the optimization of production lot sizes or discounts
for purchase quantities are not the only reasons for stockkeeping but a variety
of linked processes which need buﬀers and changed goods ﬂows to be opti-
mized. Consequently, stockkeeping is not only a matter of warehousing. What
is even more decisive is the optimal and eﬃcient handling of the necessary
goods ﬂows and their ideal combination, volume and form.
1.1.2 Characteristics of warehouse systems
The basic process in a goods distribution center is as trivial as it is simple.
A delivered article is not used at once and thus put aside until it is required
by a customer. Then it is retrieved and transferred. This reduces the main
steps to receiving, storing, retrieving, shipping goods.
In practice, due to time, quality and cost-related requirements as well as
a variety of external inﬂuences this seemingly simple process soon becomes
complex and has to be controlled and optimized:
– Goods receipts cannot be planned or the goods arrive in irregular intervals.
– Because of its dimensions, weights, temperature requirements the product
range requires a variety of diﬀerent transport, storage or handling tech-
nologies which have to be available at any time.
– The throughput of some articles diﬀers widely and is furthermore subject
to time ﬂuctuations.
– Customers order only small quantities which should be consolidated within
a short time and arrive at the shipping department simultaneously to built
a single shipping unit.
– At the same time hundreds of orders have to be handled while the process-
ing has to be optimized according to item, the type of order and shipment,
possible time slots and existing personnel and technical capacities.

– The system parameters are not constant but subject to permanently chang-

– And many more.
The complexity of such systems is mainly due to the size of the system,
the goods quantity or the required reaction time and dynamics. Table 1.1
holds the main key performance indicators for a rough comparison.
1.1.3 Optimization of warehouse systems
As already stated above the warehousing process is often eyed critically due
to the related costs of the warehousing process. This may be right but also
leads to questionable decisions. Some experts even ponder if the outsourcing
trend may be pushed by the fact that it will release decision-makers from the
tedious task of analyzing and forecasting the expenses and revenues for an
in-house logistics [9].

1. Introduction
In addition to the obvious warehousing and management costs, like inven-
tory costs (mainly capital binding and insurance costs) and technology, labor
and operating costs for the warehouse and goods distribution system stock-
keeping also causes special problems and indirect costs. Ineﬃcient processes
and structures are covered by adequate inventories. Furthermore, complex
systems include a variety of parallel transactions and processes and thus be-
come rather untransparent.
The ambition to reduce the number of warehouses and sites by central-
ization or to eliminate single warehousing levels, however, increases the need
for transparent processes, stocks and orders. In order to meet the general re-
quirements for fast and logistically eﬃcient goods distribution systems in line
with consequently minimized stocks and optimized costs structured, trans-
parent processes on the one hand and highly disciplined performance of tasks
on the other hand are required. In many cases these goals cannot be achieved
without a warehouse management system (WMS).
In this context one key element of an eﬃcient WMS is to impart a feeling
of trust and security with regard to the management and control system. One
of the main reasons for excessive “safety stocks” is simply due to the incer-
titude of the warehouse managers. This uncertainty is caused, for example,
by incomplete databases or time-consuming search for stocks, storage sites
or a certain order status. A transparent system begins with improving the
data security and thus making the database more acceptable and continues
with reducing disguised security stocks. For this reason the goal of each WMS
should be security and precise data handling. Transparent processes set the
basis for a continuous system optimization.
In addition to improving the controllability and manageability of pro-
cesses the response time and ﬂexibility are increased as well. The quick lo-
cating and accessing of goods are prerequisites for adapting the system to
the rapidly changing subordinate structures. Interfaces to subordinate sys-
tems ensure the exchangeability and changes can be taken into account at
short notice by adapting the behavior.
1.2 Warehouse Management
The authors deliberately have chosen the term warehouse management to de-
scribe the warehouse management processes and technologies although there
is the term inventory management. The majority of subjects discussed in this
book deals with the control and management of inventory systems so that it
seems much more appropriate to use the term inventory management. But
a closer look reveals that the terms warehouse management and inventory
management are not compatible.
Principally, an inventory management system is a system designed for the
management of quantities and locations (storage locations) and especially

1.3 System interfaces and deﬁnitions

their interrelations. Such a system may also work manually (e.g., warehouse
manager with cardbox system1). Nowadays, however, the majority of man-
agement system certainly is computer-controlled with additional functions
like the management of transport systems.
Warehouse management generally means the control and optimization of
complex warehouse and distribution systems. In addition to the elementary
functionality of an inventory management like the management of quantities
and storage locations, the control and planning of transport means according
to this principle warehouse management also comprises methods and means
to control the system status and to choose an operating and optimization
strategy. For this reason the system preferably has to be called internal system
for the control and optimization of material ﬂows or system for the control
and optimization of the (internal) material ﬂow. For the reason of simplicity
we have chosen the term warehouse management.
1.3 System interfaces and deﬁnitions
Warehouse management systems are mainly used to control and optimize
warehouse systems and therefore have quite a variety of interfaces to adja-
cent systems which are diﬃcult to deﬁne. According to the situation and
system structure, some control modules can also be found in adjacent sys-
tems. Small companies do not necessarily use all systems and implement
not original elements into their WMS. Depending on the functionality, there
are close connections to merchandize management systems, MIS, PPC and
ERP systems) and systems for the direct control of the material ﬂow and
order-picking warehouse control systems (WCS) and material ﬂow calcula-
tors (MFC). These systems can be deﬁned as follows:
Merchandize management system (MMS) These are computer-aided
systems for the exact recording of supply and volume ﬂows as they are
used, for example, in commerce. Their major task is to manage the order-
ing, stock keeping and marketing. For this purpose, they include book-
keeping, accounting and inventory modules. The main diﬀerence from
warehouse management systems is the value-based recording of stocks
and the storage of prices and customer data.
Management information system (MIS) These systems are often an
integrated part of a MMS. Their main task is to process and consol-
1 Actually, even today manual systems are operated very eﬃciently in certain ar-
eas. In small buﬀer warehouses in production and assembly systems, for example,
pinboards are used with labels for each kind of material. There is a slot for each
article. When an article is stored a card with the bin number is added from
above, when an article is retrieved a card is removed from below. For an inven-
tory with a limited number of articles this simple system ideally visualizes the
stocks.

1. Introduction
idate information to prepare for management decisions. They are also
called executive information systems (EIS).
Production planning and control (PPC) Producing companies use PPC
systems to optimally utilize their resources based on customer orders or a
production program and to optimize throughput times and stocks while
adhering to delivery times and utilizing their capacities.
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) In companies with several, possi-
bly international production sites ERPs are used as inter-locational PPC
systems.
Material ﬂow controller (MFC) Semi or fully automated material ﬂow
operations are performed by means of a material ﬂow controller (MFC),
which coordinates the source-sink relationships and the processing or-
der to single orders, processes, etc. by means of a subordinate control.
MFCs generally control exactly deﬁned areas like an automatic small-
parts warehouse or a transport control system.
Warehouse control system (WCS) Similar to MFC, WCSs control sink-
source relationships. Typically, additional tasks are integrated which go
beyond the functions of a simple MFC. WCS can be used to manage local
or immobile stocks and are mainly used where the main WMS functions
are performed by an MMS or ERP system and thus a separate WMS is
not required.
Figure 1.1 shows the interaction of diﬀerent systems in a distribution ware-
house. The functions, actions and communication channels are represented
to demonstrate the principal processes while the single hierarchies of the sys-
tems are represented by vertical lines. Within an inventory system the WMS
is responsible for the general optimization of stocks while the material ﬂow
controller optimizes the single processes. The more a system has to deal with
the physical aspects of the material ﬂow the more the time-related require-
ments increase with regard to the fulﬁlment of single functions.
On the superordinate level, the WMS communicates with the MLS or the
PPC/ERP system. The WMS transfers bookings to the MLS, e.g., inventory
changing processes. It furthermore communicates customer orders together
with the relevant information (e.g., delivery note data).
Furthermore, the WMS is responsible for some basic manual material ﬂow
operations. It carries out certain control functions, e.g., manual processes,
autonomously without communicating with the subordinate levels. After a
goods receipt check, for example, labels can be generated for unit loads by
which a stacker operator can identify the unit load and the target and thus
transport the unit load to the respective identiﬁcation point. The transaction
is then completed.
In case of automatic or semi-automatic material ﬂow operations, however,
the WMS communicates with the subordinate levels. In order-picking the
customer orders transferred by the MLS are processed by the WMS and
allocated to certain zones. The retrieval information for a pick-to-light zone,

for example, (allocation of retrieved quantities to shelves and generation of
the picking order) is handled by a WCS while the MFC is responsible for
the technical realization, i.e., it accesses the physical level (ﬁeld level) and
addresses the shelf display. Furthermore, single actions are shown (recording
of the picking process) and transmitted to the respective superordinated level
although this is not explicitly shown in Fig. 1.1. At the same time, when

feeder are represented in the WMS and carried out by the WCS for each area.
The single drives of a unit/device are controlled on the ﬁeld level.
As already mentioned before, in practice the functions of the diﬀerent
systems cannot be distinguished precisely and the standard process cannot
always be carried out.
E-Logistics (cf. page 15) requires an extremely close-knit network of dif-
ferent systems. Fig. 1.2 shows an example of the system structure. The rep-
resented structure may be a B2C application (business-to-consumer) as well
as a B2B application (business-to-business).
The customer communicates via the so-called shop system and not only
gets access to product catalogues and order placement, but can also generate
shopping carts, participate in auctions and actively carry out auctions by
means of corresponding tenders.
The shop system can be operated by an independent shop operator who
will be responsible to check customers and their solvency as well as the avail-
ability of products. The catalogue data is provided by the supplier preferably
for a direct availability request by the supplier’s MIS. The shop system is
also responsible for invoice matters.
In addition to a conﬁrmation orders are transmitted to the MIS of the
“distribution center” (in this case it represents trading companies as well as
manufacturers). The MIS is responsible for the complete order management,
the purchasing control (inventory audits, order proposals and order manage-
ment), maintenance of the product data and customer data and preparation
of analyses, forecasts and statistics with the aim to continuously improve the
stocks and the ordering behavior. Depending on the inventory status and
based on the order situation orders are transmitted to the MIS of the respec-
tive supplier. From here, notiﬁcations about consignments will be sent to the
WMS of the distribution center. This WMS manages the stocks and storage
locations within the distribution center, translates customer orders into the
necessary storage and picking operations and manages incoming and outgo-
ing commodity ﬂows. The management of outgoing commodity ﬂows includes
the transfer of delivery notes and invoice data to the forwarder or parcel ser-
vices and notifying the customer of the delivery. Furthermore, suppliers can
deliver directly to the customer, which is often done with high-quality goods
and express orders.
The control system of the shipper among others controls the delivery tours
and generates a detailed delivery note for the customer. It is also responsible

for the tracking of C.O.D.s and the management or returns. If the goods are
not directly shipped to the customer but to a decentralized pick-up station
where it can be collected by the customer, the delivery data are transmitted to
the station automatically by the control system or manually by the supplier.
Furthermore, a delivery can be announced by the WMS of the distribution
center which in this case acts as supplier. The customer is informed by the
pick-up station about collectable consignments. Finally, the control system
informs the distribution center about ﬁnished delivery transactions.
1.4 Structure and goal of this book
After the term WMS and its context have been deﬁned, Chap. 2 introduces
the management of warehouse and distribution systems and shows the re-
spective material ﬂow processes. Here, a warehouse system is described by
studying the typical material ﬂows and processes. Main emphasis is given
to the detailed and structured presentation of the processes, requirements

1. Introduction
and strategies in warehouse and distribution systems. Furthermore, the main
order-picking principles are described as well as some special processes and
the requirements on warehouse management systems. It is also demonstrated
how the requirements of the technical structure of a warehouse management
system can be fulﬁlled, i.e., how the tasks of the warehouse management and
control in a WMS can be carried out.
Chapter 3 deals with the optimization of storage operations as well as
scheduling and dispatching. This chapter mainly focusses on the optimization
of the order dispatch.
Chapters 4, 5 and 6 give an overview over the basic technologies for the
design and control of a warehouse and distribution system. These are the me-
chanical components like storage, conveying, sorting and distribution facilities
described in Chapter 4, the general automation technologies in Chapter 5 as
well as the principles of object identiﬁcation in Chapter 6. Available tech-
nologies are described in the context of warehouse and distribution systems
and only as far as they are of any relevance in this matter.
The general principles of information processing and communication in
networks are studied in Chapter 7. This includes the basic elements of the
operating system, communication in networks and the important matter of
data security. The various aspects of the implementation of a warehouse
management system from the requirements proﬁle up to the putting into
operation and the further information are discussed in Chapter 8.
Chapter 9 gives an example of the warehouse control and management.
At ﬁrst, the reader gets an overview over the basic architecture of warehouse
management systems, i.e., WMS based on a data-base and distributed WMS.
A warehouse management system is described based on this example, which
includes all elementary parts of a warehouse and distribution system. As a
bonus, a CD-ROM with a functioning system has been included.

2. Management of Warehouse Systems
Warehouse and distribution systems are tailor made for special requirements
and pursuant to the variety of technical and organizational features they
diﬀer more or less. Nevertheless, the basic organizational processes are similar
because these systems are part of a comprehensive material ﬂow. This book
intends to set a uniform basis for such systems and thus points out the
major frameworks, basics and procedures, on the one hand, and the resulting
requirements on the functionality of a WMS, on the other hand.
In an eﬃcient warehouse management system, these frameworks and logis-
tic entities are taken into consideration in order to achieve optimal processes.
In the following, the basic warehouse processes and functions are described
that are vital for eﬃcient operation. Furthermore, the special role of order-
picking as a labor-intensive and time-critical part of the internal process chain
is studied. Finally, the typical characteristics and key values of the systems
as well as the basic functions of a WMS are examined.
2.1 Logistic frameworks
2.1.1 Logistic principles
The term logistics
The term logistics describes the systematic approach towards the comprehen-
sive optimization of ﬂow systems, e.g., material ﬂow systems, beyond single
system boundaries. Depending on the alignment there are diﬀerent deﬁnitions
which are not dealt within this book. A lot of these deﬁnitions just describe
the role of logistics in research and teaching, with regard to the planning,
organization and control of such ﬂow systems ([31, 40, 44, 62] et al.).
Since this book focusses on the material ﬂow special emphasis is given to
the so-called “6Rs” of logistics1 The “6Rs” of logistics describe the logistic
targets as the delivery of
1 Sometimes also called 4Rs in correspondingly compressed contents.

14
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
– the right goods at the
– right time in the
– right quantity and the
– right quality at the
– right location at the
– right costs.
Despite this simpliﬁcation this principle is widely accepted. In this context
right means the fulﬁlment of customer requirements like ordered, required,
expected and minimum costs.
Coordination (synchronization) of material ﬂow and information
ﬂow
According to another recognized and relevant ﬁnding the logistic performance
of a system in the sense of an optimal delivery service at minimum costs can
only be achieved when material ﬂow and information ﬂow are well coor-
dinated. In most cases this means an information ﬂow which precedes the
material ﬂow and thus allows for the reservation of transport, storage or
handling capacities. This chapter continuously points out the importance
and realization of this paradigm.
Supply chain management (SCM)
As already described earlier, present material ﬂows include a variety of fac-
tors which lead to multi-level steps or sub-systems, a supply chain. In the
classical case where each element is self-sustained and just observes the be-
haviour of its customers (in the form of orders) and of its suppliers (in the
form of delivery times) the slightest variations in the ordering behavior at
the end of the supply chain may result in massive ﬂuctuations of the ordering
behavior (and thus of system stocks) at the beginning of the chain. This phe-
nomenon, also known as bullwhip eﬀect, was described by Forrester in 1950.
But only today, thanks to eﬃcient computer and communication systems are
we able to master these complex correlations. The key factor is the process-
ing and supply of important system information at supply chain participants
(echelons). Known strategies in this context are ECR2 and CPFR3.
Although this book does not focus on supply chain management and
the methods and tools to optimize these chains, the recording, processing
and handling of information are of great importance also for the operation of
warehouse systems. As a consequence, the decisive mechanisms and principles
of the SCM will be highlighted at all relevant points.
2 Eﬃcient Consumer Response is the direct response to the inventory system (of
the supplier).
3 Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment propagates the linking of
all supply chain elements in order to coordinate order requirements and delivery
bottlenecks early.

2.1 Logistic frameworks
15
Outsourcing
In recent years there has been a clear trend towards the outsourcing of inter-
nal logistic services. The main reasons mentioned in this context are:
– Concentration of operational eﬀorts on the core competencies, e.g., deve-
lopment and production of goods and release of management capacities.
– Reduction of logistic costs by economies-of-scale eﬀects and higher system
utilization by the licensed logistic providers.
– Balancing of seasonal work peaks or ﬂuctuations which do not justify the
generation of own capacities.
– Improved delivery services by increasing the customer presence or by re-
ducing the delivery times. Many licensed logistic providers already have
such a presence while it would be uneconomical to build up an own pres-
ence. One example is the implementation of an EDI solution with a secure
customer connection for the generation of the required delivery notices.
– Circumvention of wage-related frameworks.
– Purchase/creation of logistic competencies.
There are many diﬀerent forms of outsourcing. For example, a licensed
logistics provider may take over and operate an existing warehouse. In other
cases the stocks are transferred to the external warehouse of the licensed
logistics provider where they are stored together with the stocks of other
companies (multi-client system).
Anyway, this leads to new requirements on the operation of such out-
sourced warehouses. Since such services often are paid based on performed
transactions it is of vital importance to make the activities measurable and
transparent so that the customer is able to control the processes.
Solutions which combine diﬀerent customers in one system are much more
complicated. Here, goods of apparently the same value have to be subjected
to diﬀerent processes, e.g., during stock taking.
And last but not least it results in a variety of requirements on the ware-
house management and the employed warehouse management systems. De-
pending on their speciﬁc application, they have to be highly transparent,
general purpose systems which meet diﬀerent requirements. No wonder that
large logistic service providers typically have large manpower for information
logistics. These requirements are described in detail in the following section.
E-Logistics
One area which has become more and more important in recent years is
e-Logistics, which can be deﬁned as
an umbrella term for the planning, management and control of the
goods, information and monetary ﬂow along the complete supply
chain via public and private networks (Internet, intranets), i.e., from
the front-end over the customer’s online order (business-to-consumer

16
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
(B2C), business-to-business (B2B)) up to the tracking and tracing
and the customer services [14].
E-logistics is, thus, the connecting element of industrial activities in the
age of the Internet. Experience has shown especially in this area that an
eﬃcient logistics and quick material ﬂow systems decide whether a project
succeeds or fails. The focus on the sales channel and a neglected fulﬁllment
have at least accelerated the downfall of many E-commerce companies.
It becomes also clear, however, that classical distribution systems often
fail to fulﬁll the requirements of e-logistics. The decisive factor is the highly
ﬂexible and quick handling of small but numerous customer orders in line
with dynamically varying orders and article ranges.
CEP services and e-Commerce
For years the CEP services (courier, express and parcel services) have expe-
rienced dynamic growth. This success is closely connected to the already dis-
cussed ordering behaviour of the customers and the required reaction speed
of the companies. Especially with regard to the future development of E-
commerce forecasts predict further growth for this sector [14].
The changed distribution behaviour also has negative eﬀects on the pro-
cesses in the distribution centers where an increasing variety of small con-
signments has to be picked, recorded and booked within a short time. These
requirements can only be fulﬁlled eﬃciently by consequently using suitable
control and documentation systems.
2.1.2 Packaging and logistic units
To get a comprehensive overview all typical units which are in the widest
sense transformed during these processes have to be known. According to
[40] such a transformation process constitutes a change of the system status
of goods with regard to time, location, quantity, composition or quality. The
units are present in the warehouse systems in varying forms and combinations
depending on the requests of the relevant sub-systems and operating means
and on the customer requirements. Diﬀerent terms have established which
are above all used in logistic systems (although not stringently).
As a consequence, a study of material ﬂows starts with the quantities and
characteristics of the goods which have to be transformed in the respective
system. The actors or decision makers at the sinks of such material ﬂows put
entirely diﬀerent requirements on these units especially with regard to their
composition. At the beginning of the process chain producers or manufactur-
ers are anxious to produce goods in economical quantities (batches) and to
transport them as eﬃciently as possible, i.e., with a minimum of work steps
to the next customer. An important aspect in this context is the consolida-
tion of goods ﬂows and processes. The logistic and material ﬂow systems of
the producers generally are designed for the eﬃcient handling of a limited

2.1 Logistic frameworks
17
number of articles in large quantities. For this reason the required economies
of scale are achieved by means of a multi-level trade. These structures have
changed only with the appearance of E-commerce where classical trading
structures are sidestepped and where each producer is directly present for
the ﬁnal consumer.
Packaging
At the beginning of each goods and material ﬂow there is the necessity to
protect the goods from impacts during transport, transshipment and storage
(TTS processes) to avoid a loss of quality. This is mainly achieved, on the one
hand, by choosing a suitable packaging and, on the other hand, by building
so-called unit loads.
In addition to its main function, i.e., to protect the goods during the TTS
processes, packaging has to fulﬁll a lot of other requirements. In some cases,
e.g., hazardous goods, it should also protect the workers and the environment.
In order to facilitate eﬃcient handling during these processes a packaging
should allow for easier storage and transportation, e.g., in the form of uniform
units which can be stacked or transported by conveyors. In the retail trade,
packaging should have a high marketing eﬀect. It may oﬀer customers and
consumers a possible usability eﬀect, for example a recloseable seal or reuse
for other purposes after the original contents have been removed. Finally, the
identiﬁcation and information eﬀect plays an important role to identify the
goods within the material ﬂow (e.g., by printed barcodes) as well as for the
display of goods in the shop shelves.
This variety of requirements, which partly counteract each other, gen-
erally cannot be fulﬁlled by one single packaging alone, but only by a well
coordinated packaging system [40]. For this reason, diﬀerent types of packag-
ing have established for the diﬀerent sections of the transport chain. Types
of packaging are also classiﬁed according to the waste they produce:
Transport packaging: Protect the goods during the transport from the man-
ufacturer to the distributor.
Sales packaging: Packaging which are used by the ﬁnal consumer for the
transport of goods or until their consumption.
Outer packaging: Additional packaging of sales packaging which allow for
distribution of the goods in the form of self-service, protect the goods
against theft or serve as marketing media.
Especially in German packaging regulation, these types of packaging are
given special attention because this regulation obliges trade and manufactur-
ers to take back used packaging from the customer. A more detailed descrip-
tion of packaging technologies and problems is given in [20, 40, 47].

Logistic units
Although a packaged good represents a unit within any logistic system, it is
not necessarily a logistic unit. Such units are built with the superior goal to
combine single goods adequately so that the required logistic activities can
be carried out in the most optimal way. The most common goals resulting in
the building of logistic units are shown in Table 2.1.
In the ideal case only one logistic unit is chosen or built which passes
the complete transport chain unchanged, i.e., it is the storage, transport,
shipping and loading unit all in one. As said earlier, however, this goal is
almost impossible to achieve. Especially in multi-level supply chains there is
a trend towards even smaller units (Chapter 1, p. 2).
A logistic unit can be created by choosing a suitable form of packaging.
One example is the consolidation of bottles with condensed milk into pack-
ages. Usually packages are the smallest handing unit. For transportation they
are combined into loading units.
The building of loading units is the eﬃcient consolidation of goods into
larger, manageable units. These are handled by means of suitable loading aids.
Depending on their form and/or function, these loading aids are classiﬁed as
follows:
– bearing loading aids on which the goods are placed or stacked,
– enveloping loading aids which take up the goods and support them sidewise
– encasing loading aids enveloping the goods on all sides
For an improved product and transport protection the loading units are
also protected with securing means [92]. The most commonly used procedures
are shrinking, stretching and strapping [40].

2. Management of Warehouse Systems
As far as the material ﬂow is concerned, the change between the diﬀerent
combinations of packaging and loading units is of interest, as is shown in
Fig. 2.1.
Due to the special requirements of order-picking (cf. section 2.2.5) loading
units have to be classiﬁed even further:
– Storage units are those units in which an article is stored in the warehouse
(e.g., pallets, also supply units).
– Supply units are those units which are provided for retrieval (e.g., boxes or
containers).
– Retrieval units are units of a certain article which are retrieved by the
picker, if necessary with several single picks (e.g., packaging)
– Picking units include that quantity of articles or packaging which a picker
can retrieve with one pick.
– Collective units are built when the picker collects the single items on a pick
list.
– Shipping units represent the number of articles as ordered by the customer.
The single shipping units are often built by means of loading aids (pallet,
skeleton box, etc.).
2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
Although the requirements on a distribution center are quite diverse as are
the processes, technical system designs and control functions each system
still includes certain standardized processes. This is of vital importance since
each distribution center is only a link in a subordinate supply chain. These
typical basic processes as well as the resulting requirements on and functions
of a WMS are described in the following.
2.2.1 Goods acceptance and receipt
After the goods have been ordered by the company’s dispatcher the material
ﬂow starts with the delivery notiﬁcation of the manufacturer or supplier.
Notiﬁcation of goods receipt and delivery date
Depending on the
delivery status, a precise delivery date has been ﬁxed especially in cases
with a high number of deliveries and a low goods reception capacity. Such
time schedules should help to avoid or reduce waiting times for trucks and,
on the consignee’s or loader’s side, help to coordinate system loads and to
avoid load peaks. This, however, depends on many parameters like the size
and value of the consignment, the delivery distance and the general traﬃc
situation, oﬃcial working times (e.g., customs clearance) and, of course, on
the location of the consignee and the ideal can hardly be achieved.

2. Management of Warehouse Systems
Goods acceptance The goods acceptance is the ﬁrst important step in the
material ﬂow of a warehouse. Based on the delivery note, the consignment is
compared with the order and the bill of lading is compared with the notiﬁ-
cation. Then the notiﬁcation data are temporarily entered into the inventory
system. This process accelerates the goods receipt process considerably be-
cause in case of a positive check the data just have to be conﬁrmed.
While in small warehouse systems goods acceptance and goods receipt
may be in a physical vicinity due to the spacial separation in larger systems,
arriving trucks have to be directed and assigned to the loading gates. The
spacial separation mainly aims at a better control of the yard traﬃcs. For
this purpose, yard management systems (also stock management systems)
are used to guarantee for a coordinated traﬃc on the premises and above all
to minimize unnecessary searching and switching trips.
Goods receipt Based on the notiﬁcation data, the goods receipt depart-
ment can also be informed about the pending delivery. This is of special
advantage in case of larger deliveries (with regard to the reception system).
This includes, for example, the planning and reservation of buﬀer space, the
choice of a suitable terminal (e.g., loading gates or bays) or the print of
in-house labels for the internal identiﬁcation of goods. Cross-company la-
belling systems similar to EAN128 used in trade or Odette in the automotive
industry are advisable although they are not the state of the art in most
warehouses. One reason, among others, is the fact that a material ﬂow con-
trol puts other requirements on a labelling and identiﬁcation system than the
trade (cf. Chapter 6).
Incoming goods inspection In addition to the logical comparison of or-
dered and incoming goods, the consignment is submitted to a physical check.
This includes the inspection of all goods with regard to type and quantity is
generally performed by the unloading staﬀ. The condition of some goods is
carefully checked by the quality assurance according to the company rules.
These inspections may be a simple visual test, laboratory tests of samples
or a complete full-scale control. Faulty goods are marked with a blocking
indicator and moved into special areas or stored under consideration of the
blocking indicator (section 2.2, p. 27).
In case of new articles the article master data have possibly to be com-
pleted (cf. Table 2.13). The careful collection and maintenance of these data
are vital for a number of control and optimization functions further down the
material ﬂow process. Exact weights have to be known for order-picking tests
so that it can be checked if customer orders are complete. Special automatic
devices like picking robots need these information, e.g., to verify a successful
gripping process. For this reason, all new articles or articles still unknown to
the system have to be weighed at the incoming goods inspection.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
23
Figure 2.3. Automatic determination of unit dimensions (according to [59])
The dimensions of an article are also of importance to optimize the volume
utilization along the material ﬂow. The racks in a high-bay warehouse can
be adapted to the article range by changing the shelf heights and thus to
optimize the utilization of the storage capacity. Furthermore, according to
the volume of a picking order, the optimal shipping containers can be found
and thus shipping costs can be minimized.
The article dimensions are determined by diﬀerent methods. In addition
to measuring or entering the exact article measurements into the warehouse
management system some users are content with a rough classiﬁcation into
diﬀerent size groups. This method only makes sense when the articles are
measured manually. For this purpose often gages are used which bear marks
for the respective size categories so that it can easily be identiﬁed by the
worker.
Furthermore, there are also automatic measuring devices which scan the
article and transmit the measured dimensions directly to the warehouse man-
agement system (cf. Fig. 2.3). Then other characteristics of the article are
recorded when the article master data are not yet available.
In order to secure high-quality goods, it may be necessary to record the
serial numbers as well. The continuous control and traceability requires func-
tions beyond the goods descriptions since not the article but the special
loading unit and its movements in the warehouse should be documented.

24
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
Furthermore, the information may have been stored for a while after the unit
has passed the material ﬂow. The same applies to the tracking and tracing
of production batches.
In order to avoid the perishing of goods with a limited lifetime, it may also
be necessary to record the expiry date or the remaining life. These parameters
can serve as basis for retrieval priorities or stock transfers.
Building of loading units In many warehouse and material ﬂow systems
special loading aids are used for handling or security reasons. These are,
among others, tray storage or rack systems with standardized containers.
Incoming goods are consolidated into volume and quantity-optimized units
with the aim to minimize shipping and transport costs. Here, the goods have
to be reﬁlled in company-speciﬁc containers and consumption units to ﬁt the
material ﬂow system. The same applies to units on standard pallets (e.g., Euro
or industrial pallets). Often, the quality of the delivered units is questionable
with regard to the downstream automatic systems like a high-bay warehouse.
Damaged pallets, for example, may exceed the tolerances and thus get stuck
at certain sections of the conveyor belt. For this reason, such units often are
restored on tailor-made storage units (undamaged high-quality standardized
pallets) even if this means a worse utilization of the storage space. This
method allows for the permanent tagging of pallets for a better control. If
highly dynamic automatic storage technologies are used incoming loading
units may have to be secured additionally.
If the volume of the goods to be stored is much smaller than the available
minimum storage volume (e.g., the shelf of a rack) usually mixed pallets are
built to improve the utilization of storage space. This is of special importance
for the controlling warehouse management system. The additional storage of
articles with widely diﬀering characteristics which call for the precise man-
agement of article dimensions and available storage capacities is not the only
problem. When goods are retrieved it has to be taken care that only a certain
article is taken from a mixed pallet. It has to be avoided that the number of
partially loaded pallets becomes to large. This may require a volume control
and restorage, repackaging or densiﬁcation (cf. section 2.3.2, p. 50).
A particularity is the handling of returns (return of goods by the cus-
tomer) in the mail-order trade. In classical mail-order trade, the rate of re-
turns may be 30% of deliveries or more. Since the quality of the single articles
is not known in advance all returns have to be checked carefully. Thus, re-
turns are single incoming parts which have to be checked separately, cleaned,
repacked and labelled. This requires a considerable amount of human labour.
Depending on the used strategy the returned goods are stored at the current
single-item partial pallet or stored in special locations together with other
returned goods with a corresponding retrieval priority.
When all tests have been passed successfully, the articles are suitable for
storage and are inventoried by the system.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
25
2.2.2 Storage
In case of a manual storage system (e.g., stacker-operated block warehouse),
the process is continuous because the loading unit is taken up and then
directly moved to its ﬁnal storage bin where it is stored or transferred. In
larger automatic systems, however, the process is performed stepwise up to
the ﬁnal storage in the storage bin. For this reason, the overall process is
described below. In a manual warehouse it only consists of speciﬁc partial
steps.
Distribution to storage areas In a ﬁrst step the back orders have to be
checked (especially in manual systems), so that articles may be transported
directly to the place of consumption or into the shipping area. This process
is also called split-lot storage. Another term used simultaneously is Cross
Docking which more precisely describes an extensive concept (cf. page 59)
and thus is not the right term here.
Then the articles are moved to the storage areas. For this purpose, the
transport targets have to be determined in the warehouse management sys-
tem. Above all in large systems, there are large optimization potentials be-
cause of the long transport distances and large quantities, especially when
manual unsteady conveyors (e.g., stackers or tractors) are used. The in-house
transports can be optimized with diﬀerent methods. On the organizational
side, there is the collection and presorting of tours what requires suﬃcient
buﬀers and room for action. This method may result in diﬀerent handling
times for the goods to be transported. This can be avoided by using an auto-
matic transport control system which controls the transport of articles into
the diﬀerent storage areas by means of deterministic strategies and rules. For
this purpose, the stacker cranes can be equipped with a control system which
provides an optimal order sequence (cf. section 2.3.3, p. 50 and Chapter 3).
An important aspect is the transparency of the material ﬂow, above all in
larger material ﬂow systems. For example, when a transport unit is moved to
a wrong location this typically requires a physical search. A suitable measure
to trace the goods and identify possible errors is to treat the conveyor like a
virtual storage bin and to rebook the goods to these conveyors during trans-
ports. This results in a continuous documentation chain and single units can
easily be tracked and traced.
Identiﬁcation
If the storage unit has not yet been identiﬁed during the
goods receipt check this identity control is now carried out at the so-called
identiﬁcation point. This is often done in the prestorage zone of automatic
warehouse systems like high-bay warehouses. For this purpose, it is checked
whether the article and quantity correspond with the loading unit and if the
master data is available. At the same time the material ﬂow is synchronized
with the information ﬂow. When automatic warehouse systems are used this

happens at interfaces between the manual and the automatic system. From
now on the order cannot be changed.
At the same time the stackability has to be proven. This includes ﬁrst of
all the contour check (check of the dimensions of the goods to be stored) and,
if necessary, a weight control, especially in systems with non-uniform shelf
capacities (Fig. 2.4). This may be followed by a physical stock taking.
Assignment of the storage bin and put-away The ﬁrst step in a storage
process is the determination of the storage bin. This may be done according
to quite a variety of criteria which result from the physical requirements of
the goods to be stored, the operational and technical warehouse operation as
well as from security and legal requirements (cf. Table 2.2).
The requirements concerning the physical dimensions and weights of
goods to be stored arise from the construction of economical shelves where
speciﬁc dimensions and loads have to be determined from the current and
future range of articles. When the article range can be segmented in such a
way (suﬃcient classiﬁcation) the allowed loads usually are reduced for each
shelf in upward direction or corresponding load areas are built. In manual

warehouses, lighter goods are stored in the top shelves for ergometric rea-
sons.
In some dynamic warehouse systems like the horizontal ﬂow racks (cf. p.
104), a one-sided load has to be avoided for functional reasons. Here, the
system control has to distribute the goods evenly to optimally utilize the
available storage volume. For this reason, shelf heights should be graded to
take up goods of diﬀerent heights.
A variety of strategies can be used to optimize the operating process of
a warehouse system which is partly incompatible. The most commonly used
strategies and their compatibility are shown in Table 2.3. In this context
the shortest way strategy is a generally applicable secondary strategy and
mentioned for the sake of completeness.
Of course, security and legal regulations have priority, above all with re-
gard to hazardous goods and food. Here, a large variety of special regulations
have to be observed, which in the following are only described with regard
to their eﬀects onto warehouse management. The storage monitoring is also
an integral part of a modern warehouse management which terminates the
storage process. For this purpose, a feedback is given showing the storage
bin and time. While in automatic warehouses this step is carried out auto-
matically in manual warehouse systems (with a computer-aided control, e.g.,
stacker control system), it has to be veriﬁed by an operator, e.g., by directly

2.2.3 Retrieval / picking
Retrieval orders are managed over a longer or shorter period of time according
to the situation. In any case, the present orders have to be checked with
regard to their feasibility. The quantities and/or units to be retrieved are
blocked to avoid shortages at the ﬁxed retrieval time (cf. section 2.2, p. 27).

The dispatching and performance of the retrieval are carried out by means

Some strategies (time-phased or tour-optimized retrievals) can only be used
in line with a corresponding dispatching.
Furthermore, the warehouse management system has to monitor the initi-
ated retrieval process and give feedback about its correct completion. When
the goods have been retrieved the storage bin is released, the inventory is
updated by reducing the stock by the retrieved quantity and corresponding
reservations are cancelled.

30
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
To be able to continuously track the material ﬂow, the loading unit, re-
spectively the inventory, should be booked on the next recipient or the trans-
port means (which will logically be treated like a storage bin).
2.2.4 Consolidation point
The consolidation point is a location where handled units are identiﬁed at
key material ﬂow positions. Such a measuring point is of great importance for
demonstrating the production progress in the warehouse above all in systems
submitted to stochastic inﬂuences, e.g., manual work processes.
On the one hand, the destination and actual data are compared to check
the consistency of the material and information ﬂow. Here, the order status
is generally updated, i.e., the status of the retrieval order. The control point
sets the basis for a dynamic capacity utilization, i.e., for the utilization of
the following areas according to the work load. On the other hand, decisions
concerning the material ﬂow are made, like choosing the transport targets
for ﬁnished units.
2.2.5 Order-picking
The consolidation of a customized quantity of one or several articles is called
order-picking. Order-picking describes the building of customized units, i.e.,
the retrieval of items from a larger unit of single articles and their consolida-
tion and provision for shipment.
Order-picking is a labour-intensive and expensive part of a warehouse
and distribution center. It is, therefore, given special attention during the
planning and operation of such systems.
In modern order-picking all kinds of conveyors and storage equipments are
used. Because of the close relationship between technical facilities, process
and organizational structure and information management the design and
operation of order-picking systems is a highly complex task. Basic functions
and standardized processes have been deﬁned to improve the structuring of
these processes and tasks which should allow for a systematic planning and
organization of an order-picking system [38, 40, 88, 89]. A traditional order-
picking system is divided into the areas:
– material ﬂow system
– organization
– information ﬂow
Material ﬂow system
During the design of the material ﬂow of an order-picking system, it must
ﬁrst be determined how the pickers and articles can be brought together most
eﬃciently and in which form single retrieval units resp. collection or picking
units (cf. section 2.1.2, p. 20) should be transported further.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
31
Just in some cases (e.g., automatic picking facilities like shaft picking sys-
tems) there is no direct movement because the separating process — similar
to a cigarette automat — is carried out in the machine itself and the goods
are transported to the collection point from there. According to [40], the
physical order-picking process consists of the following basic material ﬂow
functions
– Movement of goods for pick-up
– Supply
– Movement of picker to pick-up station
– Retrieval of goods by picker
– Transport of retrieval unit for transfer
– Transfer of retrieval unit
– Transport of picked unit to transfer station
– Transfer of picking unit
– Return of broken loading unit
Based on the morphological kit shown in Table 2.5 structures and solu-
tions for order-picking systems can be found and described by combining the
single elements. It has to be taken into consideration that in order to consoli-
date picker and goods either the picker or the unit has to move. Furthermore,
either the retrieval unit or the picking unit has to be transported to ﬁnish
the picking process. The “picker” may either be a human or a machine (e.g.,
a picking robot).
In this context special attention should be given to some classiﬁcations.
Above all terms like “statical” and “dynamical” are used diﬀerently in prac-
tice and literature. The classical deﬁnition which is also used with regard to
warehousing means that at a statical supply a unit remains at the same place
from storage until retrieval (cf. e.g., [30]), i.e., that it awaits its pick-up, for
example in a rack. For a dynamic supply the unit of the desired article has
to be brought to the pick-up point and returned after the retrieval.
In more recent publications these terms describe the retrieval process
itself. It means that at a statical supply the parts to be gripped are statical
while at a dynamical supply they are in motion.
Another aspect of this problem is the classiﬁcation into centralized and
decentralized supply. Centralized supply means the supply and retrieval at a
ﬁxed location or at least in a limited area (e.g., 2–3 adjacent pallet transfer
points or picking out of horizontal rotary racks (cf. section 4.1.3, p. 104)).
The units are provided in sequence at this central point and the picker has
access only to these units. At a decentralized supply the articles are retrieved
at diﬀerent points to be approached by the picker.
In literature the statical or decentralized supply is equated with the prin-
ciple man-to-goods and the dynamical or centralize supply with the principle
goods-to-man.
Given the fact that the classiﬁcation into “centralized–decentralized” does
not cover all aspects of this problem and that picking methods where the

retrieval of an article in motion is practically unknown the following deﬁnition
is used:
The diﬀerentiation into statical and dynamical supply deﬁnes whether
the unit has to be transported by a conveyor for the purpose of
retrieval.
And:
The diﬀerentiation in centralized and decentralized supply deﬁnes the
retrieval site. At a centralized supply the articles are retrieved at a
ﬁxed location while at a decentralized supply they are retrieved at
diﬀerent locations.
These classiﬁcations are described in Table 2.6, which shows that the
statical supply is not equivalent to the movement of picker to goods (man-to-
goods (MtG) because in a picking pool the retrieval can also be centralized.
The dynamical supply may also required a movement of the picker. In these
cases the term goods-to-man (GtM) is no longer precise and it cannot clearly
be diﬀerentiated between GtM or MtG.
During the transfer of picked units, these classiﬁcations sometimes get
another meaning. As for the transfer of retrieval or picking units the classiﬁ-
cation into statical and dynamical transfer refers to the transferring conveyor
or the collection bin. If the conveyor is in motion (continuous conveyor sys-
tem), the transfer is dynamical. If the unit is transferred to a stationary
collection bin, however, the transfer is statical. The classiﬁcation into a cen-
tralized or decentralized transfer is analogous to the retrieval: if, for example,
a collection bin is carried along the retrieval units are transferred at diﬀerent
locations, i.e., decentralized, while a transfer at ﬁxed locations is considered
as centralized. Diﬀerent examples are given in Table 2.7.
Further classiﬁcations are made with regard to the kind of movement,
the kind of retrieval and the arrangement of already provided or trans-
ferred goods. The picking movement may be one-, two- or three-dimensional.
When the picker moves on ground level along a shelf his movement is one-
dimensional. A two-dimensional movement can be made, for example, by a
rack feeder or a stacker crane, while three-dimensional movements are per-
formed by cranes. Most retrievals are carried out manually, while heavy or
bulky goods are retrieved with the help of mechanical devices. In case of suit-
able article and order volumes, the picking may also be automated by means
of picking robots or shaft picking systems, e.g., in the pharmaceutical indus-
try. The arrangement of the units during the supply and transfer is also of
great importance with regard to automation. The picking can be automated
the more easily and eﬃciently the better the units are arranged.
While basic parameters and characteristics can be determined the decision
about which system is the best for a certain application practically depends
on the system design.

Articles are provided in a

those units are approached
for which a corresponding
demand exists. This process
is also called the man-to-
goods principle.

example, in

matic small parts warehouse

The

(mostly in U-shape) and the

where all articles are within
his range. Since there are
no trips the picker achieves
a very high picking perfor-
mance (up to 1000 parts/h).
The method is restricted to
the picking of a limited num-
ber of small articles.
The units are in an au-
tomatic high-bay or small
parts warehouse and have
to be brought to a central-
ized transfer point for re-
trieval. After they have been
retrieved from the shelf the
storage units are brought,
mostly by a steady conveyor,
to the picking station and
then restored. Such an ar-
rangement is also called a
picking U and the process
is deﬁned the goods-to-man
principle.
Organizational forms
The organization of the picking system, i.e., the structure and control of
the processes within the system, has a large inﬂuence on its eﬃciency. Typ-
ically, the organization is diﬀerentiated into the structural organization, i.e.,
the arrangement of the storage areas and the process organization, i.e., the
performance of picking processes.
Structural organization The structural organization deﬁnes the suitable
structure for an order-picking system. Main emphasis should be given to
the question which supply system is the best for which article. This decision

requires a careful analysis of the product range and the order structure which
results in varying requirements on the capacity, performance and features of
the supply system. These requirements are determined by:
– Volumes, weights and dimensions of the supply units
– Transshipment or gripping frequency per article
– Average quantity of each article to be retrieved per time unit, grip
– Frequent combinations of single articles
– Security requirements (high-quality goods)
– Temperature and security requirements
Since each supply system has its own special qualiﬁcations (cf. Chapter 4),
it could make sense to use diﬀerent systems. For this reason dedicated zones
are built for diﬀerent kinds of articles. But an optimization can be achieved
also within a supply system by means of a logical zoning (cf. Table 2.3).
Process organization The productivity of a picker is inﬂuenced by:
– Basic time (e.g., order acceptance, sorting of bills, take-up of picking con-
tainers, transfer of goods or picking containers, transfer or ﬁnal preparation
of documents)
– Gripping time (approach, take-up, transport and placement of retrieved
units)
– Idle time (e.g., reading, ripping of packages, searching and identiﬁcation,
control and reaction)

36
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
– Way time (movement, i.e., driving or walking) of the picker between ac-
ceptance point — pick-up point — transfer point)
The sum of these time slots is called picking time or average picking
time as far as the averaged time shares are taken into consideration. On the
one hand, it is determined by the order structure and mainly by the average
number of lines (order items) per job. On the other hand, it strongly depends
on the system structure and the organization of the units to be retrieved
and the pick-up points. While the basic and idle times can be inﬂuenced by
choosing a suitable information system (cf. p. 39) the process organization
focusses on the gripping and way times.
In the most simple case, the job is handled by just one picker who carries
out this job completely before he starts the next job. This principle is de-
scribed as a simple, job-wise picking. This process may be quite reasonable
with regard to the man-to-goods principle where the average order volume
utilizes the picker’s transport capacity. Another advantage is that it requires
less preparation. In the minimum case the arriving order is directly used as
picking list. However, the picker has to cover long distances because the pick-
ing order is determined by the order so that this principle is suitable only for
small systems.
The ﬁrst possibility for optimization is to collect and process several cus-
tomer orders at the same time what is called order-parallel picking or sorting
during picking. By increasing the density of pick-up points, the average way
time per job can be reduced. The picker has to be guided through the system
in such a way that he automatically reaches the next pick-up point and thus
long idle times (identiﬁcation of the nearest article) or returns are avoided.
In large systems it does not make sense to let a picker pass the whole
system for one order. In this case the picker would have to know all areas and
cover large distances. Furthermore, this method would lead to an increased
traﬃc and uncoordinated processes. For this reason, the areas are divided
into small sections where one or just a few pickers handle a part of the
customer order. When the articles stored in the respective zone have been
picked the collection bins are transferred to the next section. This method
is called order-picking in serial zones. It is of special advantage that single
zones can be bridged with conveyor systems if no articles have to be retrieved
from there.
As an alternative, the customer orders can be divided into partial jobs
which are assigned simultaneously to the single zones where they are col-
lected. This reduces the order lead-time. This method is called parallel or
more exactly zone parallel order-picking. On the other hand, however, there
is the expenditure for the preparation of orders and the consolidation of sub-
orders. While orders can be executed mostly computer-aided buﬀers, collec-
tion or distribution systems may be required to consolidate the sub-orders
(cf. section 2.2.6, p. 44).

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
37
All these methods have in common that the relation of the article to the
respective order is visible throughout the process. These methods are called
single level since the articles are retrieved and assigned to a customer order
in one step. The way times can only be reduced to a limited extend by means
of an order-parallel picking (simultaneous approach of similar or adjacent
articles or pick-up units) because the order has directly to be divided into
sub-orders. In article-oriented picking, on the other hand, the retrieval and
consolidation processes are separated and carried out in two steps . With this
method all identical articles in a larger order volume can be picked within one
picking process, i.e., the pick-up unit has to be approached or transported to
the pick-up station only once. The way times as well as the gripping times
can be reduced drastically.
This method requires the consolidation of several orders into so-called
batches, thus the term batch picking. After all units in the batch have been
collected the single pick-up units are assigned to the customer orders. This
is done by special conveying machinery, so-called sorting and distribution
facilities or sorters. The batch picking requires a relatively high system ex-
penditure for the preparation of orders, the transport of pick-up units and
the distribution of orders so that it is uneconomical for small systems with a
low order volume.
The article-oriented picking (two-tier picking, batch picking) renders a
high performance but also requires the following:
– Good transportability of pick-up units with similar dimensions and han-
dling characteristics
– Computer-aided order execution and consolidation for the sorting of pick-
up units and assignment to customer orders.
– Suﬃcient possibility to consolidate received orders, i.e., suﬃcient order
quantities for batches with a similar priority.
Operational organization / control strategies The operation of an
order-picking system requires diﬀerent rules, strategies and ﬂexible behavioral
patterns to meet the daily varying system requirements. As a consequence,
the operational organization of a picking system is represented by a series of
rules which are adapted to the special system requirements and can either be
part of the warehouse management system or a statistically established rule.
These are activities like:
– Input or handling of ﬁxed dates and express orders
– Order input depending on the currently available picking capacity, the
current work progress or the system status
– Assignment of pickers to zones or activities (resource management)
– Initiating supply
Principally, all measures are taken which are treated under operational
organization in Chapter 3 (see there).

38
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
Information processing
Information processing means the collection, preparation and processing of
all information which are necessary for the order-picking. These are [40, 88]
– The collection of order data under consideration of customer services and
the capacity of the recording system,
– the processing of orders in a format which is compatible with the type of
picking organization,
– the guidance of the picker by assigning pick-up stations and quantities and
– the process control.
Order-data collection Customer orders have to be collected securely and
eﬃciently while at the same time there has to be a high-quality customer
service. This leads to the following requirements on the data collection:
– A selection of possible order placements (by phone, fax, data transmission,
Internet)
– Time of order placement according to the customer’s wish (=optional time)
– Direct information about availability of articles and a possible delivery date
– Possible consultation with customers
– If necessary, consideration of special requests
On the other hand, there is the goal of a cost eﬃcient and error-free order
acceptance. Peaks have to be avoided for capacity reasons. For this reason,
often service providers (call-centers) are used for critical products. A solution
for business customers are ﬁxed request dates for regular orders. Because of
the good service and high availability Internet-based systems have more and
more inﬂuence. The current availability of articles is of critical importance
for all collection channels. This requires a precise and quick stocktaking.
The collection of order data is a typical function of an enterprise resource
planning system (ERP) but not of a WMS. This function refers, however, to
the current and realtime inventory management.
Order execution The recorded order data is unsuitable for an eﬃcient
order-picking, except in some very small systems. Depending on the chosen
picking method the following activities arise:
– Completion of orders with the picking-relevant data (storage bin, article
number, collection bin)
– Sorting of items in the order of their arrangement in the shelf
– Division of orders into sub-orders which are executed in diﬀerent zones
– Consolidation of orders into batches which have to be handled jointly
– Filtering of orders with the same priority, type of shipment or destination
– Filtering of orders with diﬀerent treatment (e.g., single-item orders)

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems

Information management
Picker routing In most order-picking systems, the operator, often supported
by technology, works as a picker. The following section focusses on how to
guide a human picker through the picking system. Automatic picking sys-
tems, on the other hand, mainly focus on certain article ranges where their
special features have the optimal eﬀect. Anyhow, automatic systems require
specialized, system-speciﬁc controls.
It is the main task of the picker routing to transmit relevant pick-up
information to maximize the picking performance and to minimize possible
picking errors. The transmission of pick-up information to the picker can be
divided into voucher-bound and voucherless processes.
Faulty pickings not only have a negative eﬀect on the customer’s trust
of the logistic abilities of the supplier, but also cause considerable ﬁnancial
loss and thus are a critical system parameter. In order to minimize errors,
controls are performed at diﬀerent stages of the picking process. Suitable
methods largely depend on the used picker routing system.
In addition to avoiding picking errors these measures should help to record
the system status and ﬁnished orders to enter the next orders. For this reason
the control is also called conﬁrmation of the order or pick-up unit.
Picker guidance with picklists The voucher-bound method is the classical
form of a picker guidance. The picker gets a sheet of paper containing the
picking information. Principally, this picklist can be used for all picking meth-
ods. In automatically supported systems, however (automatically controlled
goods-to-man systems), it makes not much sense because the information
which are necessary to control the plant (e.g., horizontal or vertical rotary
racks) are already available in an electronic form.
What is decisive for the picking performance is the order of pick-up in-
formation on the list. This should correspond to the order of articles on the
shelves. In larger systems where the pick-up units are arranged optimally
with regard to volume and way, the picklist has to be rearranged according
to the customer order which typically is arranged according to customer or
article number or alphabetically. This can only be achieved by computer-
aided management systems. In zone-parallel picking the original list has to
be divided into several partial lists.
The picklist has the advantage that it is easy to prepare and make out
and in ideal cases also additional functions can be carried out. A common
form of picklists are labels by which the pick-up units can be tagged with
various information (e.g., prices). This helps to save work steps.
A self-control of the picker is often achieved by checking oﬀthe single
items on the picklist and acknowledging the list, e.g., by signing the ﬁnished

picklist. A further control is only possible by the following 100% control of
the complete customer order.
Voucherless guidance and control of the picking process Disadvan-
tages of the picklist are the long ineﬃcient time spent to identify the next
pick-up position and handling of the list but above all the enormous inﬂex-
ibility. The basic times which are necessary to prepare and print the lists
cannot be reduced and changes on short notice are diﬃcult to add. This be-
comes evident in case of shortages which have to be reported and handled
manually. For these reasons, the picklist system requires that the picking sys-
tem react quickly to a changing system status (these also include dynamical
batch control processes in the two-tier picking).
Table 2.8. Voucherless picker routing
Description

Mobile terminal
The picker receives the pick-up information online (via
infrared or radio transmission) in other cases also of-
ﬂine (via docking stations), visually via LCD displays or
acoustically (pick-by-voice)
Stationary terminal
Stationary monitors show (online) the pick-up informa-
tion. Frequently used at central picking points e.g., at
goods-to-man picking stations
pick-to-light
Optical display at the shelves show the relevant supply
units and the quantity to be retrieved. Frequently used
in ﬂow or shelf rack systems.
For this reason, diﬀerent voucherless methods are used other than the
picklist (cf. Table 2.8). These online methods oﬀer the possibility to measure
the work progress and thus to set the basis for adapting the order control to
the system behavior (system load and capacity). Furthermore, inventory de-
viations can be recorded immediately (cf. section 2.3.5) and can be integrated
into the picking process in due time (on short term).
The voucherless methods oﬀer a better possibility to acknowledge orders.
When the picked up items are transferred individually 4, each pick-up unit
or each item can be checked and acknowledged separately. However, the time
consumption has to be taken into consideration which is especially high for
the acknowledgement of single pick-up units. A classical problem in pick-to-
light systems is that the pickers tend to hit the acknowledgement key before
the pick what in most cases leads to counting errors.
4 This is inevitably the case at pick-to-voice and in most mobile terminals; methods
like pick-to-light allow one to transfer single or several picking items.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
41
Terminal-based methods oﬀer a more advanced control. Some checks are
made with handheld barcode scanners where, for example, the shelf numbers
or each pick-up unit have to be scanned. Pick-by-voice systems analogously
request check numbers which have to be spoken by the picker.
Despite the diﬀerent control methods, it is not possible to ﬁnd a direct
connection between error resistance and transfer method. A recent study of
picking errors has shown that the picklist picking (voucher) is not inferior to
other methods ([53] and Table 2.9).
As the above example has already shown such test methods are ﬁrst of all
meant to support the picker and cannot replace the instruction, participation
and motivation of the staﬀ.

Common order-picking characteristics
The basic form of order-picking is shown in Fig. 2.5. The picker moves with
his cart along the shelf front (ﬂow, pallet or shelf rack) and grips the units
according to the information on his picklist. The cart holds one or several job
containers where the articles can be placed separately according to the cus-
tomer order. Starting at a basic station, B, where he takes up the empty job
containers and the picklist(s), the picker starts his tour and ﬁnally transfers
the ﬁlled containers at the interface for shipping. He moves in loops or me-
anders through the aisles (loop strategy). Depending on the picklists single
aisles may be skipped or passed only partially (branch-and-pick strategy).
According to the terminology deﬁned earlier this is a one-level, order par-
allel order-picking according to the man-to-goods principle where the picker
moves one-dimensionally. The provision is statical decentralized, the transfer
of pick-up units is statical decentralized and the transfer of picking units is
statical centralized.
In case of large article ranges, there is an alternative as shown in Fig. 2.6
While the principal process is the same the goods are picked in the shelves of a
high-bay warehouse. This improves the space utilization and reduces the way

42

Transfer

times since the movement of the stacker or rack feeder is more dynamical
what increases the picking performance. The sequence in which the items
have to be picked up from the shelves has a considerable inﬂuence on the
performance. There are diﬀerent methods of this so-called trip optimization
which are described in Chapter 3. Generally, the picker is guided by a terminal
which is installed on the rack.
Fig. 2.7 shows two typical systems which work according to the man-to-
goods principle. In the ﬁrst case (Fig. 2.7, a) the picker stands at the front
end of an automatic small parts warehouse (ASW) where the single-item
containers are provided for picking by a U-shaped conveying system (roller
or chain conveyor). This form is called picking-U. In the second example
(Fig. 2.7, b), the picker stands at the front end of a horizontal rotary rack
where the pick-up shelves are positioned at the front end. Often one picker
serves several rotary racks (about three) at the same time. In these cases,
the goods are provided centralized dynamically, while the transfer of pick-up
and order-picking units is centralized statical. The picker is usually guided
by stationary terminals. These systems can be used in one-level as well as in
two-step order-picking systems.
The fourth example shows a two-tier order-picking system (Fig. 2.8). The
units are picked from ﬂow racks; the supply and retrieval of goods are sep-
arated. The picker gets the pick-up information from a pick-to-light system.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
43
Figure 2.6. Man-to-goods in high-bay warehouse
The retrieved units are directly transferred to a conveyor belt or roller con-
veyor (pick-to-belt). Thus, the retrieval is decentralized statical, the transfer
of pick-up units decentralized dynamical. In the second step the retrieved
units are entered into a sorting loop and assigned to the customer orders.
Fig. 2.9 shows a reversion of the common picking process. While in com-
mon order-picking the goods are retrieved from a shelf and brought to the
transfer station in this case the order containers are arranged on a shelf.
Single-item containers are transported from a remote storage area to the pick-
up station (decentralized dynamical provision). The units are transferred to
the order containers on the shelves which, after completion of the order, are
transported to the shipping department by other members of the staﬀ(stat-
ical decentralized transfer of pick-up units and statical centralized transfer
of order-picking units). This method is called inverse order-picking and is of
growing importance especially in e-commerce (very large article ranges and
many small orders). When an optical device is used to guide the picker this
principle is also call put-to-light.
Supply control
To guarantee for the smooth and quick picking, the articles have to be avail-
able at the pick-up stations. Above all in batch-oriented order-picking systems
subsequent picking can delay many orders or lead to incomplete single orders.
For this reason, it is of vital importance to control the provided quantities
and to initiate the supply in due time.

2.2.6 Packaging department
In the packaging department the provided or picked goods are consolidated
according to certain criteria, checked with regard to completeness, packed for
transport and ﬁnally transported to the shipping department.
In larger warehouse systems customer orders generally consist of sub-
quantities coming from diﬀerent storage areas. Since it is not possible to
consolidate such sub-quantities for shipment within a few seconds, the articles
are consolidated into transport/shipping units in a ﬁrst step. This process is
often technically supported by order sorting buﬀers (highly dynamical buﬀer
stores) as e.g., ﬂow racks (cf. section 4.1.3) or rotary container racks (cf.
section 4.1.3).
To minimize the shipping costs the consignments have to be optimized.
Many companies rely on their skilled and experienced packaging staﬀto ﬁnd
the right packaging unit (e.g., box size) for each quantity to be packed. In
practice, however, it happens frequently that goods have to be repacked — a
highly ineﬃcient procedure. For this reason such a function is integrated in
most WMS which, based on a volume calculation determine the most suitable
packaging. The market oﬀers a variety of computer-aided optimization tools,
e.g., for the generation of packaging patterns for palletizing.
This step is terminated during the outgoing goods inspection where it
is checked if the customer order is complete and if the quality of the trans-
port/shipping units meets the requirements. This process can be facilitated
by consolidating and checking the pickings by means of the recorded order
weight as a sum of article and item weights. But this requires exact article
master data and mostly homogeneous weights and article ranges.

2.2 Functions in warehouse systems
45

Finally, the order status is updated by adjusting the status of the pick-up
order and, if necessary, completing the transport and shipping data.
2.2.7 Shipping department
On the face of it, the sole task of the shipping department is to consoli-
date shipping units according to orders and to load the goods into transport
means. Apart from the physical processes in the shipping zone these activities
also include a series of organizational and control functions. Unless it is spec-
iﬁed in the order the optimal shipping method or the transport means has to
be determined. This process is not an easy one due to the diﬀerent prices of
forwarders and CEP service providers. The choice of a cost-optimized ship-
ping requires the exact study of shipping quantities (volumes and weights)
as well as of the transport destinations and frequency. Based on these data
the optimal transport service provider can be found for each single trans-
port order. At the same time, tours have to be planned where the priority
of the delivery, the availability of ordered goods, already agreed delivery fre-
quencies, etc. have to be taken into consideration. These requirements vary
considerably according to the storage type and have to be considered in the
strategies.

Figure 2.9. Inverse order-picking
While the upstream storage and order-picking area is generally marked
by a continuous performance the loading into transport means often takes
place within a relatively small time slot, e.g., because of the downstream
consolidation of loads in hubs. This leads to receipt and issue peaks which
have to be buﬀered in the shipping zones. For this purpose, the shipping units
have to be consolidated prior to the loading and provided for loading. When
palletized or other larger units are shipped the loads usually are provided in
ﬂoor storage zones in front of the shipping gate. In addition to this, highly
dynamical storage technologies are used to ship smaller units and single items
(cf. e.g., section 4.1.3). In practice, the limited space at the shipping gates
leads to bottlenecks so that the organization of the shipping zone has to be
optimized continuously.
Finally, the transport/shipping documents (freight data, tour-related
loading bills) have to be prepared for the shipment of goods. The supply
chain can be made transparent by scanning the loaded units. Thus, the ﬁn-
ished order is acknowledged and a feedback is given to the order management.
2.3 Warehouse management system
2.3.1 Warehouse management
The management of a warehouse is the main function of a warehouse man-
agement system. On the one hand, these systems keep record of the storage
capacity, i.e., the speciﬁcation of the existing storage bins (location manage-
ment). On the other hand, of the stored units (inventory management). In
addition to this, it should also include several control functions to optimize
the storage activities.

Warehouse type management While the staﬀin a manually operated
warehouse system is able to independently choose the right conveyor and
storage facility owing to their knowledge and experience, in an automatic
warehouse management system single elements have to be assigned according
to their compatibility. Furthermore, the manual operator fulﬁlls certain tasks
intuitively while an automatic system is not able to derive the sequence of
work steps, like the loading or unloading of the storage channel according to
the FIFO principle, from the instructions. Some warehouse functions call for
the independent generation of orders, e.g., to deﬁne restorage or to optimize
the gripping time, and thus for the knowledge of the right storage and retrieval
operations.
The basis for such optimizations, thus are the stringent classiﬁcation of
the storage and conveyor technology from the informational point of view.
For this purpose the warehouse types listed in Table 2.10 should be deﬁned.
Management of storage bins At ﬁrst, the management of storage bins rep-
resents the technical warehouse structure, i.e., the speciﬁcation of the storage
bin based on the storage technique (e.g., shelf racks) including the descrip-
tion of the dimensions, loading capacity and position (e.g., shelf coordinates).
Some strategies for the assignment of storage bins (cf. section 2.2.2) require
such a precise description of storage locations. More ﬂexible storage methods
(e.g., ﬂoor storage areas) may only need the speciﬁcation of the areas and
coordinates.
The management of storage bins also includes the management of units
stored at a certain location. This includes the entry of goods-speciﬁc data
such as article speciﬁcations (article number or number of the unit load) as
well as the registration and update of the quantities stored in each location.
Status data are required for the control of storages and retrievals. When
the storage bin is registered at the identiﬁcation point, on the one hand, its
availability has to be sure, and on the other hand, it is has to be ensured
that this location is not assigned twice. For this purpose, diﬀerent states are
assigned with regard to the storage bin which is then blocked or reserved for

certain articles or orders. In case of a retrieval, it has to be known if a certain
unit is available. To make sure that the chosen unit is assigned to the current
order the article status has to be linked to the order. The most important
states of storage bins and unit loads are listed in Table 2.11.
In addition to the storage and retrieval the blocking of stocks or the set-
ting of blocking indicators are an elementary management function used for
various operations. These are above all
– Blocking for storage and retrieval and
– Blocking for certain warehouse operations (e.g., avoid restorage of fragile
goods).
The list of all occupied locations, i.e., the representation of the current
warehouse status, is called bin status report. The bin status report may also
include the type and quantity of articles stored in each bin.
Quantity management (Inventory management) Quantity and inven-
tory management are another logical aspect which focusses on the registration
and update of the quantities of each stored article, some times under con-
sideration of the relevant states (cf. Table 2.12). The management of goods
according to diﬀerent criteria (min./max. stocks) should ensure the supply
and avoid excess quantities. When ﬁxed limits are exceeded or not achieved
messages or actions (orders, restorage, etc.) have to be generated.
This function, however, requires a careful control of the stored goods
including the allowed storage time and blocking of the article when a certain
(expiration) date has been reached. Under certain conditions the respective
goods have to be taken out of store to protect other goods.
The main diﬀerence to an enterprise resource planning system (ERP),
which has similar functions, is the warehouse management, while an ERP

system mainly focusses on customers and sales. For this reason, a warehouse
management system generally does not contain customer data or prices. Nev-
ertheless, a functioning overall system needs the continuous exchange between
WMS and ERP.
System control The control of the warehouse condition (temperature and
humidity) and security (access control) is a special function which is of vital
importance only in a few cases.
Groupings
In a warehouse some regularly occurring tasks refer to a group of unit loads,
articles, shelves, etc. Therefore, a warehouse management system allows for
ﬂexible groupings in order to avoid the labour-extensive handling of single
elements. Such tasks occur, for example, during:
– the maintenance, repair or failure of single aisles in an automatic shelf
system,
– the goods control (e.g., special measurements for hazardous or high-quality
goods),
– the storage or blocked goods (e.g., quarantine storage),
– the choice of larger quantities or
– stocktaking.
Ideally, such groupings should be highly ﬂexible, but in any case it should
be possible to group
– storage locations (according to aisle, zone, etc.)
– article groups (according to type, article number, etc.)
– batches
As a consequence, it should also be possible to apply the management
functions (blocking, reservation, storage/retrieval) to the complete group.

50
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
2.3.2 Reorganization
An active warehouse and distribution system should be checked regularly with
regard to its eﬃciency and suitable steps should be taken for its optimization.
This is called warehouse reorganization. This action can be initiated by:
– changed retrievals of certain articles, e.g., lower throughput or change of
of the typical pick-up unit
– beginning or terminated campaigns
– changed product range
– growing number of partial storage units
As a result, storage areas are occupied faultily (e.g., wrong zone), the
average transport routes increase and the utilization of space is reduced. For
this reason, the corresponding parameter should be analyzed and controlled
continuously. The suitable system control method is described in section 2.3.4.
The resulting optimization of the system is achieved by some measures
which logically should be supported by the warehouse management system:
– rebooking, i.e., reassignment of articles to suitable retrieval categories and
storage zones
– restorage of already existing units in times with low retrieval rates (e.g.,
to reestablish an ABC zoning)
– densiﬁcation of partial units or badly utilized mixed pallets (retrieval of
relevant units, repackaging of units and restorage according to speciﬁca-
tions)
2.3.3 Conveyor management and control systems
While automatic conveyors are controlled and supervised by a corresponding
control (material ﬂow controller, MFC), manual unsteady conveyors (stack-
ers, etc.) are controlled by diﬀerent systems from the manual management
to the fully automatic system control.
Computer-aided control systems for the in-house transport are used in
warehouse management for diﬀerent reasons:
– To optimize the system performance (reduction of empty trips, larger hand-
ling volumes, higher system load)
– Flexibility of the system in case of short-term changes (quick reaction to
transport requirements)
– Control of the system status (runtime of vehicles, operational costs per
vehicle, etc.)
Systems for the deployment and control of vehicles are called stacker
control systems or transport control systems [90]. These systems consist of
a computer-aided control station or master computer, a wireless transfer

2.3 Warehouse management system
51
medium (radio or infrared) and mobile terminals on the vehicles. Incom-
ing transport orders or requests are handled, completed by relevant data
(e.g., completion of article number or description, storage location (source),
destination (sink)) and transmitted to the driver by certain procedures and
strategies.
In all control systems ﬁrst of all it has to be decided which conveyor has to
be assigned to a certain kind of order because of its loading capacity, lifting
height or other speciﬁcations. For this purpose, a classiﬁcation of the existing
conveyors has to be available in addition to the management of warehouse
types (cf. section 2.10). Furthermore, the restrictions of other facilities like
transfer points have to be recorded. There are two principle methods for the
vehicle deployment:
Dispatching In dispatching a suitable vehicle is assigned to the current
order according to diﬀerent criteria and strategies. This may be, for ex-
ample,
– the next free conveyor
– the nearest conveyor
– the conveyor with the shortest connection trip
Since the dispatching handles the currently incoming order the system
reacts quickly and ﬂexibly and the system can, thus, be used in dynamical
environments.
Scheduling In scheduling, on the other hand, several orders and/or con-
veyors are assigned to an “ideal” schedule. This method thus aims at
an optimal order sequence and system performance. The main condition
for a scheduling is the collection of queued orders in an order pool from
where they can be assigned optimally. In contrast to a manual schedul-
ing, which can seldom be used in a warehouse, the scheduling is repeated
in relatively short intervals.
In practice, mostly a mixed form of both methods is used where the most
important requirements can be considered at any time. In addition to these
extensive dispatching control systems there are simple conveyor management
systems which focus on the recording of the system status and where no orders
are assigned. This includes the recording of operating times or repair costs
per vehicle, the supervision of the battery status and control of maintenance
intervals for each vehicle. In systems where the vehicles are used by a large
number of people it may be reasonable to also record and document the driver
identiﬁcation.
2.3.4 Data collection, processing and visualization
As already described in section 2.4 a warehouse and distribution system in-
cludes a variety of diﬀerent data and key values for diﬀerent purposes:

52
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
– Activity recording
– Customer service
– Documentation of shortages from stocktaking
– Recording of picking errors, deviations at dispatch control
– Eﬃciency of the staﬀ(e.g., picks or orders per picker; storages per stacker
driver; waiting times per vehicle)
– Overview
– Bin status report (sorting according to storage bin, free/occupied, ...)
– Stocks
– Warehouse statistics (transshipping frequency, error times, ﬁlling level,
...)
– Utilization of space
– Operating means statistics
– Runtimes
– Idle times
– Maintenance and repair costs per unit
– and much more.
While the personal activity recording is not without legal problems and
generally requires the admission of the works council it sometimes is the
indispensable basis for the activity-based accounting especially with regard
to
– the recording of piece rates
– the recording of contracted logistic services
The recording of signiﬁcant status information is the elementary prereq-
uisite for the control and optimization of the distribution system. Based on
these data manpower requirements (e.g. in order-picking) or other resource
requirements have to be determined and scheduled in the system control. The
loading levels of conveyors show if parallel arranged systems are balanced.
Waiting times at certain points may indicate bottlenecks and initiate a check
of the operating strategies, system performances or personnel deployment.
The recording method is decisive for the use and successful evaluation of
the data. There are two principle methods to record signiﬁcant data and key
values:
Online recording The database which is necessary to generate the required
data is recorded in the process and automatically converted into the de-
sired key value. Thus, the key values are directly available. The record-
ing and evaluation focusses on the predeﬁned problems. Other or similar
data and key values cannot always be evaluated afterwards. The record-
ing time is almost ﬁxed and cannot be reset, for example to block out
certain events or periods, because the results just are aggregated key
values. Thus, this method represents a statical system.

2.3 Warehouse management system
53
Time series recording At ﬁrst, only a log ﬁle is made out containing the
events and the time of occurrence (time series). Here, it has to be en-
sured that the input data are determined purposefully. The required key
values are then extracted from the database via a corresponding request.
This method clearly oﬀers much more possibilities and a better basis for
the system planning and optimization. However, the data volume may
increase continuously. It is advisable to book the following data:
– Documentation of requested and completed orders
– Requests:
•
Request ID/demand ID
•
Source/sink
•
Date/time
•
Status (express-normal)
– Fulﬁllment:
•
Person or operating means ID
•
Date/time
•
Termination
– Operating protocol
– Start/end of operation
– Error message and times
– Warehouse movements
– Single information
– article-related data (article no. stocks,...)
– order-related data (order no., order item, dates...)
– unit data (storage bin no., free/occupied, quantity ...)
In addition to this, delivery notes and goods issue protocols have to be
recorded and documented for legal reasons.
2.3.5 Stocktaking
In most countries stocktaking is a legal obligation which has to be carried
out by each businessman for each business year. For ﬁxed assets and supplies,
i.e., stocks, a physical stocktaking has to be made. This has the aim to check
the inventories (booked stocks) and the reliability of the inventory manage-
ment (warehouse accounting). All objects (storage units) have to be identiﬁed
and classiﬁed by counting or measuring. The data have to be recorded in a
protocol showing the following information:
– Voucher no. (check of completeness)
– Storage location and position
– Description of the object
– Recorded quantity and quantity unit
– Unit price and total value
– Optionally information about value-related inﬂuences (age, storage time)

54
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
– Date of recording and signature (or recording person)
This procedure is immensely labour-intensive and nearly impossible in
very large warehouses. Furthermore, certain automatic warehouse techniques
do not allow for direct personal checks and for the retrieval of all units for
process-related or economical reasons. For this reason, diﬀerent stocktaking
methods have been developed which have to be cleared, however, with the
respective auditors and ﬁnancial authorities.
Annual stocktaking The classical form of stocktaking requires the physical
check of all stocks at the accounting date. Since there is no business at
this day there are no changes of the “assets”. Such a method is only
suitable for smaller systems. It is not necessary to ﬁnish the stocktaking
within one day but as close to the accounting day as possible, i.e., 10
days prior or after the date, as far as inventory changes are recorded and
considered in the stocktaking.
In a forward or subsequent stocktaking stocks can be taken at one day,
three months prior to or two months after the accounting day and recal-
culated by a special stock . This requires the use of an updating or back-
ward projection according to the Generally Accepted Accounting Princi-
ples GAAP.
Permanent stocktaking The permanent stocktaking is a suitable method
in times of little business or low stocks. Stocks can be physically taken
throughout the year if all inventories are booked continuously and all
receipts and issues are booked separately mentioning the day, type and
quantity. At the accounting day a (quantitative) inventory update is made
— a so-called book inventory.
The counting may be related to the articles or the storage bins. For this
purpose, all movements of the respective article or storage bin must be
stopped. For an article-related stocktaking all free storage bins have to
be checked separately. For this method the EDP-aided warehouse mana-
gement system has to be able to assign article or bin-related counters.
Since in automatic warehouses the stocktaking cannot be performed at
the storage bin for technical reasons the most suitable methods are the
warehouse stocktaking and the zero-crossing stocktaking. During a ware-
house stocktaking the items are counted at another location (usually at
the identiﬁcation point prior to the storage) where they are marked with
the counter. In a zero-crossing stocktaking all storage bins are recorded
at a zero-crossing (the stocks in the bins are completely removed). Dif-
ferences are entered directly and the counter is updated5.
Inventory sampling If an EDP-based warehouse management system is
used and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are met an in-
5 If shortages are recognized the warehouse management system has to initiate
a replenishment independent of the requirement (inventory) or has to consider
other retrieval points to fulﬁll the customer order correctly.

2.3 Warehouse management system
55
ventory sampling may also be used which requires considerably less ex-
penditure. Samples are taken physically which are evaluated by means of
proven mathematical statistical procedures, i.e., above all:
Sequential test The number of samples is unknown at the beginning and
results from the repeated check of the test criterion. The test is re-
peated until the acceptance criterion is fulﬁlled (fall short of min-
imum error rate) or rejected (exceeding maximum error rate). To
limit the testing period a stop criterion may be deﬁned.
Estimation The basic total is estimated based on the frequency ratio of
a sample. In case of layered estimations the basic total is splitted
from which a sample each has to be taken. Bound estimations also
use an auxiliary parameter, e.g., the booked inventory value, for the
projection.
As already mentioned above, the chosen method has to be accepted by
the auditor or ﬁnancial authorities. The following parameters inﬂuence the
suitability of a method:
– Use or existence of an EDP-aided inventory management system
– Accessibility of the shelves (freely accessible warehouse or closed area of
an automatic warehouse)
– Value of the goods (The more valuable the goods the more exact the stock-
taking. Sampling is unsuitable for “high-value goods”)
Warehouse management systems should have at least the following stock-
taking functions:
– Counting date for storage units and shelves
– Blocking of article groups or shelf areas for stocktaking purposes
– Permanent updating of counters considering the recording person, date and
time
– Zero-crossing stocktaking
The rigid stocktaking requirements do not come up to the possibilities
of modern warehouse management systems. A continuous counter booking
and zero-crossing comparison allows for an extremely detailed stocktaking.
And it should not be ignored that errors during the stocktaking process can
hardly be avoided.
On the other hand, an exact inventory management oﬀering safe data
is of vital importance for the readiness to operate. The combination of a
regular data update and a correct data management set the basis for a high
readiness to deliver and short response times. Furthermore, negligence or
thefts are detected only by a reliable stocktaking.

2.4 Basic data and key performance indicators of
warehouse systems
The planning and design of warehouse and distribution systems is highly
complex so that it is nearly impossible to describe all relevant system-related
parameters. The major part of such key values has to be deﬁned for a given
problem. In the following the most elementary key values which are used in
quite a number of systems are described. They are classiﬁed into basic data
and key values
Basic data are also called absolute numbers and directly result from mea-
surements, counts, summations or diﬀerences of certain units or they
are recorded as master data. At the same time, they also represent the
requirements and basic information to be provided by a system.
Key values should provide signiﬁcant and densiﬁed information to evaluate
and compare the eﬃciency of processes and systems. Here, absolute as
well as relative numbers, i.e., proportionate values or data are used.
2.4.1 Basic data
Master data
Master data are statical data which are not changed over a longer period
of time. The master data contain all important information about the basic
characteristics of an article, loading aid, etc. The most important master
data in a warehouse are the article master data because all main warehouse
functions and control mechanisms are based thereon.
The article master contains a description of all articles independent of
their current stock. The total number of articles represents the assortment
although discontinued or dead articles result in diﬀerences to the actual stock.
Table 2.13 gives an example of the most important elements of the article
master data.
Inventory data
This data group informs about the quantities of articles stored or provided
over a longer period of time. The up-to-dateness and accuracy of this kind of
data collection is of special importance to ensure the readiness to deliver and
to dimension the warehouse system. Since these data change continuously
they are also called dynamical data.
Movement data
The second group of dynamical data are the movement data which represent
all main physical warehouse processes. These are basic processes like goods
receipt and issue and warehouse operations as well as order-picking processes
and order execution.

2.4.2 Logistic key performance indicators
As already described in the preceding section a variety of diﬀerent informa-
tion arise in warehouse and distribution systems in the form of data. Because
of this abundance it is diﬃcult to evaluate and optimize the system. Further-
more, some data may be misleading when taken out of their context. The No.

58
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
orders/d, for example, reveal very little when it is not seen in combination
with No. items/order.
In a narrower sense key performance indicators are densiﬁed parameters,
i.e., values calculated from data and other key performance indicators. On
the other hand, all kinds of parameters with the following characteristics are
summarized as key performance indicators:
Logistic key performance indicators are numbers by which the quan-
titative aspects of logistics can be described in a concentrated form
[66].
Accordingly, basic data also are key performance indicators. The special-
ization of logistic key performance indicators takes into consideration that
key performance indicators are used in all areas of technology, economics,
etc. Key performance indicators are used to give a quick overview over opti-
mal costs and performances [66] and to evaluate the diﬀerent variants.
Above all eﬃciency/productivity values (output/input) and intensity val-
ues (input/output) are built to derive relative key performance indicators.
The generation of speciﬁc key performance indicators depends on whether
the problem is of an operative or a strategic nature. Operative key perfor-
mance indicators are ﬁrst of all used to control eﬃcient logistic processes
while strategic key performance indicators are used to develop and design
eﬃcient goods ﬂows [28]. Key performance indicators are often based on av-
eraged and approximated values and provide no precise information but just
a quick overview. Typical key performance indicators are shown in Table
2.14.
The key performance indicators “quantity turnover” and “inventory cov-
erage” show that single key performance indicators may be deﬁned diﬀerently
what leads to considerable evaluation discrepancies. Therefore, it should be
checked carefully if a key performance indicator relates to the value, quantity
or performance.
Since single key performance indicators can represent only partial aspects
and the variety of possible key performance indicators and their combinations
make it diﬃcult to use them targeted and systematically they are combined in
key performance indicator systems [66]. Thus, the auxiliary key performance
indicators which contain the necessary information for a management task
are combined in a hierarchical structure of systematically linked single key
performance indicators. According to Reichmann, the top key performance
indicators of such a system are the transshipment frequency, the overall lo-
gistic costs and the readiness to deliver. The main problem, however, is to
develop such a system for a special application.
While single key performance indicators can easily be used to analyze
deviations and to reach certain goals in warehouse management extensive
key performance indicator systems are a main tool of logistic controlling and
will not be described here any further.

2.5 Special procedures and methods
2.5.1 Cross docking
In cross docking goods receipts and dispatches are coordinated to such an
extent that incoming goods are directly transferred to the shipping depart-

60
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
ment without being put away. Thus, they are not entered into the warehouse
system which is a pure transshipping system with the aim to:
– reduce stocks at certain points along the supply chain
– increase the eﬃciency by avoiding process steps
– reduce the throughput times of articles in the system
– improve the services by more frequent deliveries
– sort articles eﬀectively according to destinations, e.g., for CEP
This method should not only minimize the stocks in the distribution sys-
tem or at the cross docking point but also at the POS. This requires frequent
deliveries what improves the services. There are two principle cross docking
methods:
1. Cross docking with broken pallets
2. Cross docking as ﬂow system
Cross docking with broken pallets
The incoming units are quasi single-item units and have to be distributed
or picked according to the orders of the single subsidiaries. Palletized units
are typically transshipped in roller containers, a principle which is also called
two-level or container cross docking. A main feature of this method is an
order-picking process.
Cross docking as ﬂow system
Here, the supplier pre-sorts the incoming units according to the orders of the
subsidiaries in such a way that the single units do not have to be broken
and distributed but only have to be consolidated, i.e., combined with other
single-order units. This principle is also called one-level cross docking. If only
complete transport units (e.g., pallets) are handled this method is called
pallet cross docking. If the pallets hold pre-sorted containers which have to
be assigned to the single subsidiaries or tours this principle is called pre-sorted
store order. In this case the goods are only transshipped without counting or
direct picking processes.
Prerequisites and ﬁelds of application Many requirements have to be
met before the cross docking principle can be used. One eﬃcient way is to di-
rectly transfer incoming goods. However, this requires that the desired quan-
tity is available on short notice so that the risk of shortages is very high due
to lacking stocks. It is practically impossible to restore articles in case of an
order cancellation. If the subsidiaries have similar order structures the tours
are scheduled almost simultaneously. This may lead to bottlenecks at the
goods issue and thus to several deliveries of single subsidiaries a day.
In practice this method is only suitable for systems with a relatively con-
stant demand, similar quantities and articles, short replenishment times and

short distances to the subsidiaries, for example for fresh goods. Furthermore,
these principles are used for certain groups of goods within existing goods
distribution centers where corresponding processes have to be integrated into
the warehouse management system. [11] gives recommendations for the real-
ization of communication interfaces.
2.5.2 Outsourcing of the physical distribution and warehousing
processes
The outsourcing of logistic services was already described earlier in this book
(cf. p. 15). The warehouse management is inﬂuenced, among others, by con-
necting external systems to the own enterprise resource planning (cf. Chap-
ter 7).

62
2. Management of Warehouse Systems
To be able to adjust the processes in multi-client outsourcing warehouses
to the special requirements of the customers the processes, procedures and
strategies have to consider not only the goods and customers but also the
client. This feature has to be integrated into the WMS which is then called
multi-client enabled.
Since provided services are often settled on the basis of performed activ-
ities single client-related services (e.g., stacker trips, picking positions) have
to be recorded separately.
2.5.3 Application Service Providing
Similar to the outsourcing of physical warehouse processes to an external
service provider in Application Service Providing (ASP) IT services and
computer-aided control functions are outsourced to a service provider who
controls the processes from a central computer center where he also carries
out the necessary evaluations, processing, etc. Such services are successfully
used in wage and ﬁnancial accounting.
An advantage are not only direct cost savings, e.g., by a reduced EDP
staﬀon the site, but above all the data security. A central service provider
can aﬀord other better possibilities than many companies at decentralized
locations.
In logistics such solutions are used in the form of shop systems in e-
commerce and ERP but also on WMS superordinate levels. An ASP solution
where time-critical processes in a large distribution system are controlled from
a central computer center is still unknown because the transmission security
cannot be guaranteed and the response times may be too long. Breakdowns
and failures would inevitably lead to process interruptions.
With regard to current developments in the information and communi-
cation technology such solutions are quite conceivable above all for smaller
applications. The basic functions remain unchanged so that the special pro-
cedures will not be described here.

3. Fundamentals of an Operational
Optimization
The optimal operation of a warehouse or distribution system has been
achieved when every customer order is ready for dispatch completely and in
due time and when all necessary processes are carried out within the shortest
possible time and with minimum resources also under changing conditions.
To meet these requirements the processes have to be planned and coordinated
in advance.
The order planning and dispatching in a warehouse management system
assigns all goods movements in the warehouse to the respective resources and
determines the time and order of the order execution as to avoid delays and
to achieve a continuous system load without bottlenecks. This also helps to
minimize unproductive auxiliary process times.
This chapter describes the methods of a computer-aided order dispatching
and the basic algorithms and heuristics of a typical warehousing problem.
3.1 Optimization in short
The achievement of economical, technical and organizational goals requires
optimized operational processes in a warehouse or distribution system.
Each work step which has to be performed in a warehouse requires one or
several resources, i.e., personnel and operating means which in turn consume
money and time. The aim is to provide the maximum transshipment perfor-
mance consisting of all single work steps with the lowest possible amount of
resources.
Furthermore, the relationship between supplier and customer results in
additional frame conditions, which have to be considered when operational
processes are optimized: agreed time slots for deliveries and shipments of
ordered goods deﬁne the period of time for the execution of certain activities.
The ability to provide information to the customer about goods and delivery
or collection dates is only possible with a preceding scheduling.
3.1.1 Background
Optimal acting means to choose “that decision out of a number of possible
decisions which best meets a speciﬁed target” [61]. Such situations occur in

64
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
all areas of our life. In logistics decisions closely linked to make the optimal
choice. A typical example is the planning during the design of a material
ﬂow. Diﬀerent system solutions are developed which have to be limited to
one variant during the selection process. This choice is based on the functions
of the material ﬂow system to be designed.
During the operation of a material ﬂow system a very large number of
decisions has to be made continuously, e.g., concerning the order dispatching
where the optimal order sequence has to be determined.
Optimization is the classical task related to the design and operation of
all technical systems. It comprises all aspects of the system design with the
general aim to provide a desired function at the lowest possible overall costs.
Consequently, there is a large variety of rather diverse methods which all
together are called the optimization theory.
At ﬁrst, this chapter gives a short overview over the optimization theory
followed by the classiﬁcation of warehouse problems.
Principally, optimization is the same as the targeted search for the op-
timum result within a given scope of action or within a number of given
alternative actions. The aim is to ﬁnd that one alternative oﬀering the opti-
mal result in one of the following scenarios [41]:
– To achieve the best possible result at a given expenditure (maximization
problem).
– To achieve a deﬁned result at the lowest possible expenditure (minimization
problem).
– To achieve the optimal result at the lowest possible expenditure (so-called
dual problem).
In order to determine the optimal solution the alternatives have to be
quantiﬁable, i.e., comparable. An important element of an optimization is
the deﬁnition of target criteria as well as of a target function, as basis for the
determination of the achievement degree or optimum of individual alterna-
tives. Thus, the basic task of all optimization activities is to
Determine the aim (W) under consideration of the given situation
(G) so that a target function F(W, G) is either minimized or maxi-
mized [61].
Many scientiﬁc disciplines have contributed to the development of user-
speciﬁc mathematical optimization methods. These are, among others, the
cycle theory and the decision theory [65] which, however, are mostly used to
solve economical problems.
Two scientiﬁc sectors with a diﬀerent history directly deal with the plan-
ning and operation:
Operations research (OR) aims at developing methods and procedures
(algorithms) for the determination of optimal solutions. Typical ﬁelds of ap-
plication are the preparation of time schedules and the sequencing of work

3.1 Optimization in short
65
steps as well as the solution of standard problems like the minimization of
trips in a warehouse by an adequate arrangement of storage areas. Another
important criterion of OR is the expenditure to be spent on a solution. As
described later on in this chapter, there are optimization problems which
cannot be solved optimally or not at all by computers within a ﬁnite period
of time.
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) goes beyond the methods of OR since it con-
siders the aspect of an autonomous decision making for machines (computers)
and tries to transform patterns of the human intelligence to the computer.
An example is the modelling of certain optimization problems by means of
artiﬁcial neuronal networks. Here, the main emphasis is given less to the de-
termination of an exact optimal solution but to the general solution within
an acceptable period of time even if this would mean a loss of quality.
Because of partly identical applications and methods both disciplines can
hardly be diﬀerentiated; both are computer-aided methods and thus part of
the computer sciences.
3.1.2 Classiﬁcation of the operational optimization
During all phases of a warehouse and distribution system, i.e., from the plan-
ning up to the operation there arise problems with regard to optimization.
The general goals of an optimization are:
– Consistent load of the operating means and staﬀ
– Avoidance of unnecessary idle times
– Reduction of empty conveyor trips
– Minimization of order lead times
– Observance of given order time slots
A ﬁrst approach is to deﬁne a time horizon for the following problems
Long-term planning tasks deals with the design of a warehouse system in line
with the strategic problems which have to be solved, e.g.:
– Dimensioning of storage areas and choice of the warehouse technology.
– Preparation of a warehouse layout (arrangement of the storage areas and
access ways).
– Development of fundamental operating strategies and proof of the system
functionality, e.g., by simulation.
In a warehouse layout the storage areas and ways have to be arranged in
such a way that the forecast goods ﬂows can be handled by the chosen sys-
tem technology with minimum transport expenditure. Although the planning
of the facility is not part of the operational optimization process a detailed
knowledge of the operating strategies to be used may be required to operate

66
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
the diﬀerent working areas of a warehouse system. To prove the overall func-
tions, the operating strategies which have to be implemented into a WMS
could be represented in a simulation model and thus be optimized at an early
stage.
Medium-term planning processes, which are due, for example, monthly
or weekly, are based on the turnover of a warehouse system during this time
and have to adapt the available resources to seasonal ﬂuctuations. Typical
planning tasks are:
– Planning the assortment, adapting the article range to be kept in stock in
order to react to seasonal or market-related inﬂuences.
– Manpower requirement planning, preparation of shift models or work
schedules.
– Reorganizing stocks, e.g., stock transfers following an ABC analysis1.
The reorganization of stocks by means of article transfers with frequent
access to the front storage areas also is a method to improve the access
on an article and thus to minimize order lead times. If suﬃcient capacities
are available for the execution of orders this method can also be applied in
shorter intervals. But the resulting savings have to be seen with regard to
the additional expenditures for stock transfers.
Organizational optimization in its real sense means the operative plan-
ning, i.e., the management of daily work processes. It is based on the current
order and delivery volume detailed to the day and represents the operational
activities over a maximum period of just a few days or hours. It has to fulﬁll
the following tasks:
– Resource assignment, scheduling and sequencing of picking and transport
orders
– Planning of transport routes within the warehouse
– Comprehensive planning of batches , i.e., preplanning all work processes in
the warehouse
The period of time which is available for the management varies accord-
ing to the tasks and is furthermore inﬂuenced by short-term changes like
express orders, unplanned goods receipts (deliveries unscheduled by the sup-
plier, wrong quantities) or operational breakdowns.
Depending on the available data of the orders to be managed and the
available period of time, the optimization times are still classiﬁed into oﬄine-
and online problems.
1 The generalized ABC analysis is a so-called cluster analysis where access fre-
quency on the available articles is not analyzed for three (A-B-C) but for any
number of articles. In the most extreme case the quantity to be studied is just
one article.

3.1 Optimization in short
67
Oﬄine problems are marked by the fact that all order information are avail-
able before the dispatching, e.g., the calculation of an optimal (order schedule
cf. section 3.2) The oﬄine scheduling is the classical form of sequencing in OR
and is described in detail in the relevant literature.
Online problems occur when orders are assigned to the operating means
without a scheduling or when new orders are assigned to a running work
processes with a ﬁxed procedure. Online problems are also called dispatching.
Online problems also arise when new orders have to be added at short
notice to an already planned schedule because of unannounced deliveries or
express orders.
The optimization theory comprises quite a number of other problems and
optimization models which diﬀer only slightly with regard to their logistic

According to [71] possible dispatching methods are divided in
– Order-based dispatching, i.e., a still unscheduled order is chosen which is
then completely scheduled, i.e., suitable resources and intervals are chosen
for every work step. This is repeated until all orders are scheduled.
– Resource-based dispatching, i.e., one resource is chosen for the schedul-
ing of the best suitable work step. This is also repeated until all orders (all
order steps) are scheduled.
– Operation-based dispatching, i.e., an operation (work step) and the suit-
able resource and interval are chosen until all orders are scheduled.
The remarks on the optimization of order dispatches have to be considered
as operational dispatching. For an exact classiﬁcation and representation of
the dispatching processes in the form of a batch generation please refer to
section 3.2.4.
Customer orders are orders managed by a subordinate ERP system and
contain information about which article has to be provided at a ﬁxed date at
the goods issue in which quantity for which customer. The basic elements of a
dispatching are orders which have to be executed by the warehouse resources.
Unlike customer orders, which initiate a warehouse operation, the term order
describes the movement of just one storage unit (loading means, package,
article) from a source to a sink and thus an elementary logistic operation.
Order elements which have to be considered during the dispatching are, for
example:

68
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
– Clear labelling of the units to be moved (LHM-ID, article number)
– Source and sink
– Executing resources
– Order reference (e.g., sub-order of a picking order)
– Time slot (earliest starting date, latest termination date)
– Priority
– Order status (still unprocessed, in process, ﬁnished)
Depending on the type of order sources and sinks may be storage loca-
tions, resources or loading facilities. Together with the choice of the executive
resources and information about the storage units to be moved they consti-
tute the main order data.
Resources are the executive units within a warehouse system, i.e., the
manpower and the conveyors and storage facilities. To be able to assign the
orders to be executed within a certain period of time to the warehouse re-
sources information about these resources have also to be available, i.e.:
– Performance (conveying speed, gripping time, etc.)
– Capacity
– Current work load
In addition to this, order dispatching requires information about the
topology of a warehouse, on the one hand, to calculate the order execution
time based on the covered distances and, on the other hand, to determine
the shortest route in case of several possible routes between source and sink.
The presentation of routing or cycle times in the form of adjacent matrixes
is a necessary element of the WMS data model.
3.2 Optimization processes in a warehouse
At ﬁrst, the methods of an operational optimization and the related problems
are described by use of some examples.
3.2.1 Transport optimization
A WMS controls the transport within a warehouse, e.g., pallet transports
between the diﬀerent storage areas with stackers, transports on conveyors or
the storage and retrieval in automatic high-bay warehouses, which will be
described in more detail below.
In a high-bay warehouse, all transports are managed by the WMS as
single transport orders for one loading facility (cf. Chapter 5) stating the
source and sink coordinates. Then they are transferred to the subordinate
control of the rack feeder in the warehouse aisles. Thus, the WMS controls
the order of cycles to be performed by a rack feeder in an aisle. In each aisle

Figure 3.1. Example of a double cycle in a high-bay pallet warehouse
the loading facilities to be stored as well as those retrieved by the rack feeder
are buﬀered in storage bins in the warehouse prestorage zone. Thanks to
this buﬀers the transport movements in the HBW are decoupled from the
remaining warehouse material ﬂow.
A basic optimization method in an aisle is to combine simultaneous stor-
ages and retrievals into multiple cycles, where one empty rack feeder makes
the connecting trips between a storage and a retrieval point to minimize the
routes and thus to maximize the throughput.
Creation of double cycles
In the present case, the load-carrying equipment of the rack feeder can take up
one pallet. Since the prestorage zone as transfer point has to be approached
at the beginning and the end of a multiple cycle the optimization is limited
to combining two transports, a storage and then the retrieval, into a double
cycle. If there is a suﬃcient number of transport orders the rack feeder starts
the double cycle by taking up a pallet in the prestorage zone and stores it
at the designated location. Then, it approaches a pallet to be retrieved and
transfers it to its location in the prestorage zone.
If the order list of the WMS holds more than one storage and retrieval
job for an aisle which can be executed in complete double cycles without
sequencing restrictions the WMS determines the best possible combination
of double cycles before charging the rack feeder.

The order volume assumed in Fig. 3.1 consists of three storage and re-
trieval jobs and thus of three double cycles2, which have to be executed by
the rack feeder in a consecutive order. At the beginning of the sequence the
transfer points TP1 to TP3 are occupied by the pallets for orders 1 to 3. The
pallets which are retrieved in the course of a storage process are then stored
at the released storage locations (TP1, TP2 or TP3).
The ﬁrst of the three storage jobs 1 to 3 may be followed by one of the
three retrieval jobs 4 to 6. The following storage job (one out of two) may
then be assigned to one of the remaining two retrieval jobs. The last double
cycle consists of the remaining two orders. Since each of the storage jobs 1
to 3 can be the ﬁrst in this sequence the number of possible double cycles in
n for this order volume according to 3.1 is
n = 3 · 3 · 2 · 2 · 1 · 1 = 3! · 3! = (3!)2 = 36
(3.1)
Thus, theoretically 36 combinations have to be analyzed with regard to
the optimal sequence of trips. Since the time slot for all double cycles for the
take-up and transfer of pallets remains unchanged the only optimization cri-
terion is the minimization of the overall distance. By means of the distances3
to be covered for fulﬁlment of the single orders in Fig. 3.1, the distances of the
double cycles can be determined as well as the overall distance to be covered.
(cf. Table 3.1).
2 For a better understanding the storage locations to be approached and the trans-
fer points are arranged in one level so that only the horizontal distances have to
be considered when determining the optimal order of double cycles.
3 The distances are entered without units into the coordinates of the storage lo-
cation (in this case only the width).

3.2 Optimization processes in a warehouse
71
It may be useful for the calculation that the order of double cycles seems
to have no eﬀect on the overall distance and that it does not matter whether
the double cycle sequence is 1 - 5 - 9 (cf. Table 3.1) or 9 - 1 - 5. As a whole
this strategy reduces the expenditure for determining the best solution since
only six sequences (3 · 2 · 1 = 3!) have to be built and compared.
In the present example the optimal order is the double cycle sequence
1-6, 2-5, 3-4) with an overall distance of 38 bin units. The worst double
cycle sequence is 2-4-9 (corresponding to the order sequence 1-5, 2-4, 3-6)
with 46 bin units. Generally, the following equation applies for the number
n of possible double cycles at a symmetrical order volume of k storage and
retrieval jobs each:
n = k! = k · (k −1) · . . . · 2 · 1
(3.2)
The problem described in equation 3.2 is characteristic for quite a number
of similar optimization problems. A typical such sequencing or scheduling
problem 4 is the travelling salesman problem (TSP), which is described in
detail in the relevant literature and represents a basic optimization problem
also in other technical and scientiﬁc areas.
A characteristic feature of the TSP is that the calculation expense grows
unproportionately in line with the order volume and requires a large number
of calculation steps and comparisons to ﬁnd a solution. The present problem
is relatively easy to solve exactly with six comparisons. It would require 10!
= 3.628. 800 comparisons to ﬁnd a suitable solution for ten double cycles.
Assuming a calculation time of one second on a medium performance PC, it
would take more than four days to search all solutions in order to calculate
a sequence of 15 double cycles.
As described later in this chapter, despite increasing computer perfor-
mances, the calculation time is a critical factor given the high number of
orders which have to be considered when dispatching all work steps within a
warehouse (cf section 3.3).
Multiple cycles at higher capacities
In containers or tray storage systems where load suspension devices with a
higher capacity can be used, there are further possibilities to combine and
thus to optimize transport trips.
The load suspension device of a rack feeder in a container store has a
take-up capacity of two containers. The load suspension device should take
up two containers at the transfer points TP1 and TP2 and store them at the
locations 1 and 2 (cf. Fig. 3.2). In the course of this double cycle two other
4 The present optimization problem provides for the determination of just one
optimal sequencing of already known transport orders. Additional conditions
such as the transport capacity of a rack feeder or the time slot for the order
execution have not yet been considered.

Figure 3.2. Example of a multiple cycle in a container store
containers have to be taken up at the locations 3 and 4 and transferred at
the transfer points.
When the containers are stored and retrieved at random the combinations
described in Fig. 3.3 are possible for the combined storage and retrieval of all
four containers. Theoretically, the containers can be moved in one double
cycle and thus in eight diﬀerent trip sequences (2 · (2 + 1 + 1)).
In order to ﬁnd out which trip sequence achieves the shortest overall cycle
time the times for all single trips have to be determined and added for each
of the eight valid combinations.
In the present example it is assumed that the rack feeder, after having
taken up the containers, carries out the ﬁrst storage job from the reference
point X where it will return after the last retrieval prior to the transfer. For
reasons of simplicity, it is also assumed that the height and width of the
shelves are equidistant and the horizontal or vertical speed of the rack feeder
is identical. The trip time between two locations thus is proportionate to
the longer section of a traverse path, i.e., the maximum of the horizontal or
vertical section of a single trip.
Table 3.2 shows the possible eight trips and the resulting overall paths of
the rack feeder. Compared to the best solution (26 unit lengths), the length
of the worst solution (37 unit lengths) is 42% longer. This shows that trips
can be optimized considerably optimizations also in small projects like this.
The sequencing problem occurs in many other ﬁelds of the material ﬂow.
Typical examples, other than the combined multiple cycles in container and
tray storage systems, are the transport planning for stackers and tractors with
a loading capacity of more than one pallet which should approach all storage

locations on the shortest way. Similar problems arise during order-picking,
according to the man-to-goods principle (cf. Fig. 2.2.5).
This problem, however, exceeds the TSP because the higher loading ca-
pacity of the conveyors increases the number of combinations considerably
and thus the calculation input5. In the following, the calculation input for
this optimization process, a multi-capacity TSP, is calculated on the basis of
the search area, i.e., the number of possible order combinations.
A conveyor has a take-up capacity of n uniform loading units. The order
should be executed in a closed cycle of known orders, i.e., no orders are added
during the execution. At the beginning of the tour n loading units have been
retrieved from the buﬀer and loaded on the conveyor according to its capacity
which have to be stored at the respective sinks (E). Like in the example above
n loading units have to be retrieved (A) and returned to the buﬀer. During
this order cycle a total of 2 · n loading units are moved.
Since all storage and retrieval jobs are known at the beginning of the tour
the dispatching can be made in advance to determine the shortest tour for
5 The example of a load suspension device shown in Fig. 3.3 with a double loading
capacity allows for a higher number of possible sequences (eight combinations)
than a load suspension device with a single capacity which executes the orders
in double trips (2!=two combinations).

the approach of all loading points (sources and sinks) in the working area.
During the sequencing, however, constraints have to be considered which are
due to the limited capacity of the conveyors.
1. A tour has to start with a least one retrieval or storage (E) and
2. to end with the take-up or retrieval (A) of the last remaining unit load.
3. Only as many retrieval points (A) can be approached in succession as
there are loading bins on the conveyor.
By this general task description all possible order combinations can be
determined and based on the resulting search area the ones with the shortest
overall path can be found. In order to describe the building of the search
area orders may be shown as nodes in a search tree where the sequence of
retrievals and storages is entered (cf. Fig. 3.4).
The ﬁgure shows a multi-capacity TSP with a capacity of two or three
loading points. The nodes in the search tree each stand for an order within
a sequence which has to be handled top to bottom. These nodes also bear
information about the order type (storage E or retrieval A) with the number
of variations for an order at this point.
Every complete branch describes the possible order sequence but only
the array of successive storages and retrievals and not the deﬁnite order
sequence6.
An array stands for that order sequence where the storage and retrieval
jobs are arranged in this way. The number of possible sequences 7 for individ-
6 As an example there are the storage jobs E1, E2 and E3 as well as the retrieval
jobs A1, A2 and A3. A deﬁnite (and valid) order sequence may then be E1-
E2-E3-A1-A2-A3. The array is the qualitative order of storages and retrievals
without clear information, in this case E-E-A-E-A-A.
7 Invalid order sequences are, for example, those with an array E-A-A-E-E-A. The
capacity of the conveyor would be exceeded by the ﬁrst two take-ups.

ual branches can be determined by multiplying the coeﬃcients of the nodes
on a branch. The product is the same for all branches.
The valid order sequences for a conveyor capacity of k = 3 are shown
in Fig. 3.4. In this case there are ﬁve branches with valid arrays. The top-
most node may be occupied by one out of three possible storage jobs. The
node coeﬃcient for the top retrieval job is determined in the same way. The
possibilities for the nodes further down decrease correspondingly. The num-
ber nARRAY of possible arrays at a given capacity k and the corresponding
number of storage and retrieval jobs can be determined by the equation 3.3:

(2·k)!

With a capacity k = 3 there are 20 possibilities for the sequencing of all
storages and retrievals within a cycle. However, some are invalid because they
are inexecutable.

3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
Here, the term (k!)2 represents the product of the node coeﬃcient of a
branch.
In this example, the total calculation input can be reduced by at least
75% compared to a complete solution which takes into consideration all pos-
sible (also the invalid) order sequences. This not only helps to determine the
optimal order sequence but also the calculation input.
Considering the above-mentioned relations the volume of the sequencing
problem can be reduced considerably. The strategy may also be applied to
larger order volumes which are handled successively by a conveyor in several
cycles.
As an example, four storage and retrieval jobs have to be carried out
with a minimum input of a conveyor with a capacity of k = 2. Theoretically,
the single orders can be executed in 8! = 40320 diﬀerent sequences. If the
conveyor capacity is fully utilized and the orders are grouped so that two
storages and retrievals are carried out in one cycle the number of possible
sequences is reduced to (4!)2 · 22 = 2304.
This method is also used to reduce the search processes during an opti-
mization. A general form of this procedure is the Branch&Bound (cf. sec-
tion 3.3.3).
3.2.2 Sequencing of picking orders
The optimal sequencing of picking orders can also be described and solved
as the ”travelling salesman problem”. Here, the retrieval points represent the
locations, the pickers or the system technology represent the vehicles and the
transfer/pick-up stations the depot. The optimal sequence of retrieval points
has to be determined for each order.
Exact and heuristical methods have been developed to solve the TSP
and tour planning problem (cf. section 3.3). Heuristics are used to determine
the relevant problem because the runtime of the exact algorithm is too long.
Tours can be planned with opening procedures which in the ﬁrst step provide
a valid but possibly sub-optimal solution. The solution may be optimized by
subsequent improvement processes.
The TSP can be opened by ﬁnding the best successor or the strip strategy.
At the best successor method the order with the shortest distance is chosen
out of an order pool as successor of the starting order. Here, it is made use of
the fact that the driving speed of a vehicle generally is higher than its lifting
speed.
For the strip strategy, the cross-section of the warehouse is divided into
strips of the same size. The shelves in the single strips are approached in turn.
At the end of each trip, the picker goes to the next strip. This procedure
can be improved by swapping the edges, e.g., with the 2-opt or the 3-opt
method where the solution should be improved by swapping the edges in the
respective graphs.

Figure 3.5. Order-picking strategies
Heuristic tour planning methods (cf. Fig. 3.5) are diﬀerentiated to whether
the aisles are passed (meander heuristics) or if the picker turns around in the
current aisle (center or largest gap heuristics). At the meander heuristics the
picker passes an aisle if it contains at least one target shelf. The aisles are
passed in a predetermined order either left to right or the other way round.
If more than one shelf has to be approached in one aisle the best alterna-
tive is the center heuristics. Here, each aisle is split in two parts. The shelves
in the upper half are approached from the upper aisle, the shelves in the
lower part from the lower aisle. The picker leaves the aisle at the side where
he has entered it.
Another excellent method is the largest gap heuristics. Unlike at the center
heuristics the aisle is passed up to the largest gap. A gap is the distance
between two neighbouring shelves to be approached or the distance from the
aisle to the next shelf. The largest gap is that part of the aisle which is not
passed.

3.2.3 Routing in the warehouse
The purpose of routing (also trip optimization) in the warehouse is to de-
termine the shortest way if there are several possibilities. Unlike in a high-
bay warehouse where the storage locations are approached with the shortest
way from the storage point the schedule of a driverless transport system, for
example, may allow for diﬀerent routes for one tour. In some warehouses,
transports with stacker cranes oﬀer several possibilities 8.
A typical situation is shown in the ﬁgure below where a consignment has
to be moved from the given source to the marked sink.

Figure 3.6. Routing problem in a warehouse
The warehouse layout consists of storage locations arranged in rows which
are connected by an orthogonal network of ways. The shortest way from
the source between nodes 11 and 12 to the sink between nodes 4 and 5 is
approached on the route →11 →8 →5 →S. Principally, however, all other
possible (and longer) routes between both ﬁnal nodes of the tour can be
chosen.
In order dispatching a computer-aided vehicle control system is used to
determined the shortest route for the execution of an order. In addition to
a path matrix this step also requires information about the path network
in the warehouse to be able to determine the shortest way. One method
to determine the shortest way is the Dijkstra algorithm, by which the way
between a starting node and a target note can be determined in a graph (cf.
section 3.3.3).
8 In these cases, it depends on the ability of the staﬀto ﬁnd the shortest way to
the sink.

3.2.4 Comprehensive order dispatching
The goal of an order-related batch generation is to manage orders which have
been received until a certain deadline in ﬁxed intervals, so-called batches.
The term batch calculation is used in diﬀerent contexts and describes the
prearrangement of picking or sorting orders as well as the complete order
management in a warehouse.
Within a batch all received orders have to be arranged and assigned to
the warehouse resources as to achieve the shortest possible processing time
in line with a continuous system load or utilization of resources. A general
term for this kind of problem is job-shop-scheduling.
The following examples describe the batch scheduling for a warehouse [78].
A superordinate ERP system transmits jobs to a WMS where customer orders
are accepted, delivery dates are coordinated and preprocesses according to the
current stocks and the job load. An order transmitted to the WMS generally
consists of the following elements:
– Order number (clear)
– Customer number
– Number of articles to be delivered for this order
– Date for the provision at the goods issue (and then collection by the ship-
per)
The order intervals are an important parameter for the batch planning
since the optimization potential is the largest for large order volumes. The
scheduling of order-related delivery dates stands in direct connection to the
batch scheduling and has to be determined based on the current resource
productivity values. In some cases this kind of dispatching is impossible:
an exact forecast of a delivery date would imply that this order had to be
integrated into the current backlog. The orders of this backlog, however,
are also given time intervals for delivery so that it would be necessary to
recalculate the order schedule9.
An order dispatching method used in many companies is based on the
medium-term estimation of the productivity so that articles ordered up to
a certain time can be provided for pick-up at the goods issue until the next
day. The order dispatching in the WMS (and thus the batch scheduling) is
typically carried out as follows:
– Acceptance of orders by the host system
– Separation of orders into single items and multiple item jobs
– Determination of storage locations for single articles
– Determination of the required number of containers for picking
– Calculation of the handling time (lead time) of each job
9 An exact batch dispatching method is described in [3]. According to this method
it takes several minutes to calculate the daily picking schedule in a picking area
with some thousands of items by means of an exact method (CSP).

before shipment, working hours, shift model)
– Provision at goods issue
Multiple item orders consist of similar operations which have to be se-
quenced optimally already in this planning step, e.g., in case of discrete pick-
ings. The operations have to be assigned within the batch planning to the
warehouse resources.
Thus, all customer orders are separated into elementary operations, which
are scheduled backwards starting with the respective delivery dates. Each
resource is assigned to an order pool which can be locally optimized later on
(cf. Fig. 3.7).
The sequence of orders in a pool can still be modiﬁed if the time schedule
(valid at that time) allows for such a change.
The time needed to plan the batches mainly depends on the number of
orders to be planned and thus on the working time to be represented (time
intervals). In principle, the batch size or the time interval can be detailed
at random so that the calculation time is reduced considerably. It has to
be considered, however, that smaller optimizations are achieved with short
time intervals because the resources can be fully occupied for this complete
interval to a limited extent.
On the other hand, when smaller intervals are used more information are
available about the occupancy of resources because orders can be dispatched

and batches can be recalculated at any time. The batch scheduling in a
WMS has to fulﬁll these two requirements — optimized order throughput
and short-term dispatchability.
3.3 Optimization of solutions
3.3.1 General aspects
The problems which arise during the operational optimization and the dis-
patching are computable i.e., they can be described by an algorithm.
The complexity deﬁnes the computation time of an algorithm and thus is
of vital importance for its development and use. Therefore, it is also called
computational complexity. Based on the algorithm structure an estimation
is made to determine the complexity. This estimation reveals the demand for
resources 10 of an algorithm at a given problem volume n.
The time complexity T (n) can directly be determined as a function of the
n input data by counting the operations computed by the algorithm. Since
emphasis is given to the functional behavior of n rather than to exact digital
values the time complexity is represented by the O notation which represents
the highest degree of that polynomial which describes the runtime of the al-
gorithm. As an example the time complexities of a typical task are shown in
ascending order:
• O(log n) :
Logarithmic expenditure, e.g., binary search in n struc-
tured data
• O(n) :
Linear expenditure e.g., addition of n input values
• O(n log n) :
quasi-linear expenditure e.g., sorting
• O(n2) :
Quadratic expenditure e.g., vector multiplication
• O(nk) :
Polynomial expenditure e.g., matrix multiplication
• O(2n) :
Exponential expenditure e.g., accomplishment problems
• O(nn) :
E.g. travelling salesman problem (TSP)11
P describes the category of problems which can be solved with an deter-
ministic12 algorithm in a polynomial and thus practically realistic time, i.e.,
O(1), O(n) or O(nk). NP describes the category of problems which can only
be solved by a non-deterministic algorithm in a polynomial period of time.
10 Generalized for disk space and time needed to ﬁnd a solution. The complexity is
a combination of the time complexity T(n) and the memory complexity S(n).
11 An algorithm for the complete solution of the TSP is exactly described by the
runtime behavior T(n) = (n!) while the order O is determined by means of the
Sterling formula n! ≈nn · e−n ·

3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
According to the current state of computer sciences a deterministic algorithm
needs a time which exponentially increases the size of the problem.
In addition to the formal deﬁnition the following features are character-
istic for an algorithm:
– Finiteness – A time-phased algorithm solved in a problem-based, prede-
termined number of computing steps.
– Clearness – The further steps are determined at any time.
– Eﬀectiveness – Each work step in carried out in a ﬁnite period of time
– Eﬃciency — The algorithm requires minimum disk space and computing
time.
The algorithm is always closely related to the predictability of the solution
quality while the term heuristics13 is used for those procedures where the
quality of the solution cannot be predicted.
3.3.2 Overview over the optimization procedures
A variety of diﬀerent methods is used to optimize combined problems. These
methods can be diﬀerentiated by the descriptive algorithm or heuristics, the
runtime behavior and their robustness. The following classiﬁcation shows the
basic procedures while a concrete implementation is described in the next
section.
Assignment strategies in queues
Assignment strategies are an eﬃcient method to assign orders to resources
and are mainly used to solve online problems. The order pool of a resource has
to be considered as a queue from where the orders are retrieved successively.
New orders can be added to this queue at any time (Fig. 3.8).
New
orders
Order pool
Resources
Figure 3.8. Dispatching in queues
The optimal sequence of all orders in the queue can be calculated only to
a limited extent since the combination of orders varies over the time. Thus,
the principle of the “best successor” is used for these cases. Such dispatching
strategies pick an order out of an order pool of the size n, which changes over
the time with a linear searching expenditure of (O(n)).
13 Greek heuriskein: to ﬁnd.

3.3 Optimization of solutions
83
An optimization, i.e., the search for the best successive order, focusses
on application-speciﬁc criteria. For conveyors and order-picking systems this
may be the shortest connection trip. Other criteria are the priority of the
order or the dispatching date. Search dispatching strategies are studied in
[3, 64].
Enumerating methods
In completely enumerating optimization methods all solutions within a scope
of solutions are studied so that it is guaranteed that the exact optimal so-
lution is found. However, all solutions have to be generated and evaluated
successively with the respective expenditure.
Since the number of solutions for real problems may be enormous com-
pletely enumerating methods are in this case not very eﬃcient. The typical
sequencing and scheduling problems belong to the group of NP complete
methods with exponential solution expenditure.
Adapted enumerating optimization methods reduce the solution expendi-
ture by integrating heuristics. The complete enumerating methods are mod-
iﬁed in that way that a minimum of solutions have to be generated and
evaluated while at the same time generation of the best solution (global opti-
mum) is ensured. A known example for such a method is the Branch&Bound
algorithm.
Calculation-based methods
With indirect calculation-based optimization methods the optimal solution
is found by means of a gradient method which studies the target function in
dependence of the parameters. Based on the target function the gradients are
set at zero and then the resulting equation for the corresponding parameter
is solved. The results represent the local optima which are compared and
evaluated. With this method the global optima can be identiﬁed.
With direct calculation-based optimization methods the best solution is
searched by targeted steps within a search area. A randomly chosen starting
point represents an initial solution. Near this solution the direction with the
steepest incline, i.e., the highest gradient value is determined.
The method searches the solution scope iteratively and stops when there
are no better solutions in any direction. This method is called “hill-climbing
method” because it unerringly ﬁnds the nearest local optimum.
In the best case the last local optimum is also the global optimum. But
since the global optimum is not guaranteed the result is just an approx-
imation. It has to be taken into consideration that only the enumerating
optimization method ensures the best solution although calculation-based
methods in most cases require considerably less expenditure.

84
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
Random methods
Random or stochastic optimization methods operate without a targeted
search but iteratively generate random solutions which are evaluated and
improved until a stop criterion is reached.
With the Monte-Carlo strategy diﬀerent random solutions are generated
and evaluated. If a better solution is found, it overrides the last one. A com-
mon stop criterion is the number of iterations.
Random walk is another method where the solution scope is searched
step by step based on the initial solution. Each solution is developed by
marginally changing the last one at random. The best solution is saved and
the stop criterion may also be the number of generated solutions.
Nature-analogous optimization methods also belong to the group of
stochastic methods. Analogous to natural processes the chemical/physical
and biological models are diﬀerentiated.
Conclusions about the quality of the solutions cannot be made neither by
means of the Monte-Carlo strategy or the random walk nor with one of the
nature-analogous methods. In some cases not even a local optimum is found.
3.3.3 Examples of known methods
Some highly specialized methods have been developed to solve all kinds of
optimization problems. The algorithms described below represent some of the
published methods for the optimization of warehousing problems.
Branch&Bound algorithm
The Branch&Bound principle is an exact method where systematically
promising solutions are generated based on the solution of simple sub-
problems and sub-solutions which do not result in the optimum are excluded.
In the following example the shortest route shall be determined to demon-
strate the functioning of the Branch&Bound algorithms (cf. Fig. 3.9). The
respective graph shows the knots 1 to 5 and the drawn side lengths. Node 1
is the starting node and node 5 the target node of a certain tour.
To point out the single route ﬁnding steps the solution is described in
3.10 of the diagram.
Distance, predecessor and lower limit each represent a ﬁeld the size
of which corresponds to the number of nodes in the graph. Like with the
Dijkstra algorithm the next known Min is taken from a quantity B of nodes
still to be processed whereas B corresponds to those nodes in the graph which
can be reached directly from the already studied nodes.
Starting from this node Min all adjacent nodes are studied. If the neig-
bouring node still has no predecessor Min is entered as predecessor and the
path length over Min to the starting node is entered as distance. If there is
a predecessor this is replaced by Min if the distance from the starting node
is shorter via Min than the distance saved for this neighbour.

Figure 3.9. Example of a TSP
Distance             Predecessor            Lower limit
Figure 3.10. Determination the shortest route
As can be seen in ﬁg. 3.10 in line 2 in the example the estimated path
lengths for the adjacent nodes of the starting node 1 are calculated as follows:
Lowerlimit(2)
=
0 + 4 + 5 = 9
Lowerlimit(3)
=
0 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 11
Lowerlimit(4)
=
0 + 3 + 8 = 11
The most promising node, thus, is node 2 which is therefore taken from the
quantity B to study its neighbour. The search for the best route is terminated
when the target node is taken from the quantity B. In this example this
happens when node 5 is reached after only 3 steps. The shortest route can
then be determined with the ﬁeld predecessor (1-2-5) and its length can be
derived in distance (5) = 9.
The Dijkstra algorithm determines the shortest route by means of a graph
is also based on this method.
Heuristic openings
The goal of an opening is to determine valid order sequences which do not
necessarily have to be optimal because they are improved later on by a re-

86
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
spective method. The following method describes the solution of a TSP with
n locations and one starting point similar to the computation of an order-
picking sequence. It is the basic idea of the savings heuristics to approach
all locations individually directly from the starting point (0). Such a solution
consisting of commuting tours (0 →j →0) seems to be rather unfavourable
because the overall distance resulting from the sum of all single distances d0j
(distance between 0 and the location j) would be computed very ineﬃciently
with
2 · n
j=1 d0j
(3.6)
But if a tour is chosen in such a way that two location sij are approached in
one cycle savings sij can be achieved by
sij = d0i + d0j −dij
(3.7)
These “savings” are computed for all location pairs which allow for a joint
tour under consideration of possible restrictions. The savings algorithm can
be formulated as follows using a distance matrix D = dij, 1 ≤i, j ≤n [108]:
1. Generation of an initial solution, all commuting tours (0 →j →0) for
j = 1, . . . , n.
2. Determination of all savings according to eq. 3.7 which may be generated
under consideration of the restrictions. Sorting of computed savings sij
in descending order in a list.
3. Search for an edge dij, for which sij is the maximum. Connecting the
locations i and j if the following applies:
– The locations are not on the same route.
– None of the locations i and j is an internal point of a route.
– No side conditions (capacity, time, driving distance, etc.) are violated.
Cancel sij, continue with step 4.
4. Check whether more tours can be combined. If so, continue with step 3,
otherwise step 5.
5. End
Other openings are “best successor”, the sweep method [107], especially
for the planning of picking orders and the methods described in 3.2.2.
Deterministic r-opt improvement methods
The r-optimal methods assume a valid solution determined by an opening and
try to improve the quality by exchanging a number r of edges in a sequence
graph. In 2-opt methods the possible exchange of two edges is studied. If this
improves the solution the edges are exchanged.
The algorithm for the 2-opt method to determine the shortest tour in the
scope of a TSP is described as metacode. Known factors are the n locations
s1 to sn and the distance matrix C where all distances between two locations
si and sj are entered as a way distance cij as well as an allowed starting

Genetic algorithms
Genetic algorithms (GA) belong to the group of nature-analogous methods
which adapt the mechanisms of natural systems in the form of technical and
economical applications [32]. The idea of developing and using genetic algo-
rithms to solve technical optimization problems was initiated by observations
and the wish to imitate nature which follows the principle of the “survival of
the ﬁttest” 14.
Genetic algorithms generate better (and some times worse) solutions out
of a pool of initial solutions within the population by means of recombination,
i.e., a new combination of already existing solutions. The worst solutions are
excluded from the pool and replaced by better ones until no signiﬁcant im-
provements can be achieved after several iterations. To ensure that the GA
produces no identical solutions the mutation method is used, i.e., a recom-
bined solution is changed at random.
The following steps describe the basic procedure of a GA. It assumes
a problem size divided by the number of elements n for which an optimal
sequence should be determined:
1. Generation of a basic population of µ elements (initialization, µ ≪n!).
2. Deﬁnition of a stop criterion for the following closed loop.
3. Evaluation of the individuals with the target function f (evaluation of
the ﬁtness by means of the path length),
4. Choice of individuals from this population (selection depending on the
ﬁtness)
5. Generation of oﬀspring (recombination)
6. Modiﬁcation of the characteristics of the oﬀspring (mutation).
7. Repetition beginning with step 3 until the stop criterion is reached.
14 According to the evolutionary theory the “Survival of the Fittest” is the result
of selection, inheritance and natural random mechanisms, the mutations which
lead to individual changes and characteristics of biological organisms.

Figure 3.11. Selection according to the ﬁtness ratio (roulette wheel)
Sequencing problems are encoded as GA in such a way that the orders
to be sequenced each correspond to one gene within one strand the genome
or chromosome. Each order may take any place within the chromosome and
the execution sequence will then correspond to the position within the chro-
mosome.
During the initialization a random generator generates a basic population
out of µ diﬀerent chromosomes. With regard to sequencing problems the
ﬁtness of these chromosomes corresponds to the tour length determined in
an evaluation (e.g., order-picking tour15).
In the scope of a selection the parent chromosomes are chosen for re-
combination according to their ﬁtness. Based on the relative frequency of the
ﬁtness a simple choice is made (cf. Fig. 3.11). But this may lead to dominance
eﬀects. Certain chromosome characteristics would be selected with an over-
proportionate frequency. Therefore the GA just focusses on a local optimum.
This eﬀect can be avoided by normalising the ﬁtness values.
After two parents have been selected, their genes are bequeathed to their
oﬀspring by recombination operators. An operator for sequencing problems
which is easy to implement, in addition to various problem-speciﬁc operators,
is the uniform order-based crossover where a random bitstring along the
chromosomes determines which genes will be bequeathed to which oﬀspring
(Fig. 3.12).
The points in the bitstring marked with 1 bequest the genes of parent
1 to the ﬁrst oﬀspring while the other genes marked with 0 are bequeathed
by parent 2 to the second oﬀspring. The empty spots in the chromosomes of
the oﬀspring are ﬁlled with the parent genes corresponding to their order in
the parent genomes. Thus it is ensured that only valid genetic sequences are
generated for the oﬀspring (no doubling of genes).
15 It has to be considered that the ﬁtness is maximized or minimized according to
the problem, i.e., depending on the basic target function.

Figure 3.13. Application of mutation operators
By mutation single chromosomes within a population can be modiﬁed
purposefully to limit the scope of solutions and thus to avoid a mere local
optimization. In case of the mutation operators shown in Fig. 3.13 sections of
a chromosome are arranged either by mirroring the gene sequence (inversion)
or by a random rearrangement (scrambled sublist).
How the diﬀerent operators are used for reproduction depends on the
reproduction model of the population or GA. This model deﬁnes, among
others, the number and possibility pcross of the parental pairs to be selected
and recombined and their oﬀspring as well as the number of generations as

90
3. Fundamentals of an Operational Optimization
well as the respective mutations and clonings with the possibility of their
occurrence.
At the same time the reproduction model classiﬁes the computation ex-
penditure and thus is a measure for the long-time behavior. Generally, the
computation expenditure for the GA described above can be considered as
polynomial.
In contrast to the classical optimization method, a genetic algorithm does
not rely on the stepwise improvement of just one solution but on several
solution instances which occupy diﬀerent places in the search area at the
same time. Thus, genetic methods are more resistant to changes of the input
values which determine the problem and can, thus, ensure that the solutions
are generated within a locally limited area (local optimum). For a further
study of genetic algorithms please refer to [36, 43].

4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Corresponding to the variety of problems and tasks concerning the storage
and transport of piece goods, there is a similar multitude of systems for
their eﬀective solution. In the following chapter the most common technical
solutions for the storage and transport of goods are presented as a basis
for a study of the eﬃcient control and management by means of a warehouse
management system. The intention of this chapter is not to compare diﬀerent
systems and technologies with the aim to optimize the choice of technologies
or systems but to provide a basic knowledge about these systems. For more
comprehensive and comparative studies please refer to other publications
[40, 54, 72, 73].
4.1 Warehouse systems
The correct evaluation and choice of warehouse systems calls for a system-
atic and general knowledge of the system performance. The basic features of
diﬀerent warehouse systems are shown in Table 4.1 as well as some general
characteristics. Warehouse systems are classiﬁed into statical and dynamical
systems depending on whether they require a relocation during the storage
process. The restorage in a classical rack system is not considered as a dy-
namical storage.
Some basic characteristics can be identiﬁed by this classiﬁcation. The
primary parameters for the choice of a storage system are:
– Number of diﬀerent articles
– Article dimensions and weights
– Quantity of each article
– Required storage/retrieval performance or throughput
– Space requirement
– Retrieval behavior and strategies
The most commonly used systems are described below and classiﬁed with
regard to their applications and requirements on the system control. They
can further be systematized according to the storage function, the type of
construction and the used conveyors.

4.1.1 Ground store
The goods are stored or stacked directly on the ﬂoor. The stacking height
depends on the characteristics of the goods or on the used loading aids (e.g.,
skeleton boxes), the handling facilities (e.g., stacker or crane) and on the
construction layout.
This simple form of storage requires only little investment costs and can
be adapted ﬂexibly to the constructional conditions (layout and form of the
building). When the aisles are wide enough, relatively high transshipment
performance can be achieved with a corresponding number of transporters.
This type of warehouse is operated mainly manually.
Ground block storage The goods are arranged in a compact block, i.e.,
directly one upon another, side by side and one after the other. The space is

4.1 Warehouse systems
93
Figure 4.1. Ground storage a) Block storage b) Line storage
optimally utilized by this method, but only the goods in the ﬁrst row can be
accessed. Therefore, this principle can be used only in warehouses working
according to the LIFO strategy (cf. Table 2.4, p. 29) These may either be
classical mono-structured warehouses (beverages, raw materials) or buﬀer
warehouses in the goods receipt/issue if complete loads are buﬀered.
Ground line storage In order to give better access on the single unit loads,
compared to the ground block storage, the articles are arranged in such a
way that each column is located at an aisle. This reduces the degree of space
utilization but increases the number of purposefully stored articles.
Organization and operation The disadvantage of this simple system is the
diﬃcult control of the material ﬂow. Since only ground space is recorded as
the storage location and the storage and retrieval is controlled manually and
according to the article type, it is not possible to record a single unit load.

94
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
The same applies to the direct assignment of a storage location to an operator
(stacker driver) since precise reference points such as the shelf numbers on a
rack are missing. There is no exact bin management, quantities are managed
by recording the incoming and outgoing units.
This situation possibly leads to problems with the tracking and tracing of
batches. If such a tracking is required single batches can be stored in separate
ﬁelds. In more advanced systems the exact position is recorded during the
storage and retrieval process by GPS (global positioning system) or based
on the AGV (automated guided vehicle) technology to ensure the tracking of
the material ﬂow [60].
On the other hand, in fully automatic block warehouses which are oper-
ated by cranes or automated guided vehicles (e.g., for the storage of paper
rolls or steel coils), the single items are recorded and managed exactly without
the problems mentioned above.
4.1.2 Statical racking systems
Racks are mostly used to optimally utilize the space and height of a ware-
house. The unit loads are placed on a separate shelf or a speciﬁed bin in a
rack. This allows for the eﬃcient storage also of not stackable goods. The rack
height is mainly determined by the used operating facilities (cf. section 4.2).
Accordingly, the rack heights range from 2 m (manual operation) to about
50 m (for rack feeders).
In addition to the problems of the physical storage, questions arise with
regard to the choice of a racking system. A great advantage of this system
is the possibility to clearly assign unit loads to storage locations and the
almost complete implementation of necessary strategies. This sets the basis
for the automation of storage processes and ensures an that the storage area
is ordered and well-organized during the daily operation.
Goods stored in line racks can be accessed from any side while block racks
allow for a more compact storage and a high utilization of space in line with
a high throughput.
Most racking systems, however, are suitable only for single-type goods
and standardized loading aids. If only complete unit loads are stored and
retrieved they are also called unit warehouses.
Line racks
The design of a line rack varies according to the size, form and weight of the
goods to be stored, the chosen or possible handling technology, the required
storage and retrieval performance and the constructional conditions. The
single shelves have to be adapted to the maximum dimensions of the goods
to be stored plus all handling and transfer tolerances. The length of the
individual lanes and the arrangement of the rack aisles are mainly determined
by the requirements of the order-picking system.

4.1 Warehouse systems
95
The term ”line rack” means that single shelves are arranged on top of
each other and side by side where the unit loads can be stored and retrieved
directly at the front. In case of a normal single-deep storage each unit, the
load can be accessed directly so that all possible storage strategies can directly
be implemented (section 2.2.3). Strategies like FIFO or LIFO are based on
the warehouse organization and not on the physical arrangement of storage
locations. Furthermore, the unit loads can be stored double or triple deep
with a suitable handling technology. When unit loads in the back row have
to be accessed, however, this requires restorage or special storage operations
which reduce the throughput1.
Provided the system has a functioning bin management all unit loads
can easily and quickly be localized and retrieved. Line racks are always of
advantage where moderate quantities of a large variety of single articles have
to be stored.
Diﬀerent goods require diﬀerent types of construction which are called
pallet rack, container rack, box rack or box warehouse depending on the type
of loading aid or traverse rack, cantilever rack, honeycomb rack according
to the construction of the warehouse. These systems are further divided into
storage systems with and without loading aids.
Large and heavy unit loads are generally handled with fork lift trucks,
rack feeders or cranes which vertically lift the units. In some cases also satel-
lite vehicles are used which are equipped with load suspension devices for
a sidewise take-up (automatic distribution vehicles). Light units are gener-
ally handled manually. The width of the aisles and thus the space utilization
varies depending on the used handling technology.
Pallet rack Pallet racks are the most common type of pallet storage systems
and are designed for use of a standardized loading aid. In the classical case the
stored unit load (pallet or skeleton box) is supported only at both front ends
whereas the unit load is stored lengthwise or crosswise. In case of a lengthwise
storage two traverses are ﬁxed (screwed, ﬁtted or welded) between the front
and rear rack supports where the unit loads are stored side by side. Due to
their construction standard pallets (800 mm×1200mm, 1000mm×1200mm)
have to be stored lengthwise referred to the shelf depth (cf. Fig. 4.2). Because
several unit loads may be stored side by side this principle is considered
a multi-bin storage system. Generally, three up to max. ﬁve unit loads are
stored side by side in a so-called ﬁeld.
For a crosswise storage an angular support is mounted between a front
and rear support and the unit load is stored frontal to the support and thus
crosswise. There is only one unit load between the rack supports so that this
system is a single bin storage system.
1 Actually, strictly speaking the multiple-depth storage is a block storage. But as
most systems use a double-deep storage and multi-functional load suspension
devices these systems are considered as line racks.

96
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.2. Pallet rack with lengthwise storage [Photo: ST¨OCKLIN SIEMAG]
The lengthwise storage allows for a more eﬃcient utilization of storage
space since the racks require less supports and security distances. Most rack
feeders are not so small as to allow for narrower aisles. In manual order-
picking, however, the crosswise storage ensures a better accessibility of the
shelved articles (the maximum reach of a person is about 950 mm).
In case of a double-deep storage the heights of the traverses have to be
adapted to the constructional height and the bending of the load suspension
device.
If pallets with diﬀerent dimensions are stored which do not ﬁt the tra-
verse grids, sheets or boards may be placed on the traverses so that, strictly
speaking, a kind of shelving systems is created.
Container racks When very small articles or small quantities have to be
stored the standard pallet size (800mm×1200mm) often does not lead to a
satisfactory utilization of space. For this reason smaller containers or trays
are used for this purpose (400 mm×600mm). Trays are metal troughs with
a gripping bar at the front. Since the articles have a low weight they can
be stored on simple angular proﬁles which are mounted at the sides of the
shelves.

4.1 Warehouse systems
97
Figure 4.3. Automatic mini-load system with trays [Photo: BITO]
Thanks to the low weight the shelves can be served more eﬃciently what
resulted in special designs of line racks and are called container, box or tray
racks. Owing to the relatively low weight of the items the unit load (container,
box, tray) can be pushed into or pulled out of the shelf. For this purpose the
load suspension device grips the bar or handle of the tray or removes the unit
by means of gripping pliers (cf. Fig. 4.24). With such pulling technologies
shorter load transfer times can be achieved and the vertical safety can be
reduced so that the storage space can be utilized more eﬃciently.
The container racks are generally served by automatic rack feeders and
called automatic mini-load systems (cf. Fig. 4.3). If mini-load systems are
used in accessible areas, they have to be encased at the sides to avoid a
shifting of the unit loads which may lead to considerable damage in case of
a collision with a rack feeder. Special attention is also given to operator and
theft protection.
Mixed pallet storage The storage of diﬀerent single item containers on one
pallet or mixed pallet puts special requirements on the warehouse manage-
ment. In addition to the management of several units at an identical location
(what is generally done by booking the units on one pallet ID), the quantities

98
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
stored on the pallet have to be controlled because the retrieval frequencies
diﬀer for each unit. This may even require consolidations (cf. section 2.3.2).
Furthermore, if an article has to be added to a partially loaded pallet this
unit has to be retrieved what causes additional ways. This problem also arises
in connection with mixed storage on trays and in containers.
High-bay racking The term high-bay warehouse is often used to describe
high racking systems although it is correct only for a rack height from 12 m
onwards. The term high-bay warehouse describes a high-bay racking system
with ﬁxed storage and retrieval machines (S/R). High-bay racks can have a
height of up to 50 m and may oﬀer space for more than 100 000 pallet bins
or several 100 000 container bins.
Such systems are often constructed as silo systems where the racks support
the ceiling and the walls and thus build a single-purpose construction which
is only used for storage purposes. One advantage of this system, in addition
to the short implementation time and relatively low costs, is the considerably
shorter amortization time. However, the rack construction has to allow for
the storage of all other kinds of loads.
Lift systems (tower racks) A special type of line rack is the lift system
or tower rack. Here, two storage columns are arranged directly face to face.
In between drives a vertically operating special load suspension device which
pulls the trays and moves them between the shelves and the transfer sta-
tion (cf. Fig. 4.4). Owing to the low weights, high acceleration and thus high
storage and retrieval performances can be achieved.
In addition to systems with ﬁxed shelf heights in a storage column, sys-
tems with ﬂexibly deﬁnable bin heights are used. For this purpose, other than
ﬁxed shelves a take-up grid for trays is created with a grid width of about
100 mm where the trays are inserted. After the height of the unit load has
been recorded the tray is stored and the corresponding level is blocked for
further storage. Thus, the shelf heights can be adapted to diﬀerent goods and
the space utilization can be optimized especially when unit loads of varying
height are stored.
Shelving system In a shelving systems, each shelf has a continuous bottom
(or grid) on which goods of any dimension can be stored. Owing to the ﬂexibly
adjustable height, diﬀerent shelf arrangements and a variety of accessories the
shelving system can be adapted optimally to the requirements of a manual
order-picking where it is used as the standard rack type. The normal rack
height is 2 m. When auxiliary means are used (e.g., ladders) also racks with
a height of 3 m are used although the picking performance is reduced by
additional movements. Furthermore, multi-level systems are used to better
utilize the height of the room (mezzanine shelf). Here, the serving platforms
are directly mounted at the rack supports (cf. Fig. 4.5).

4.1 Warehouse systems
99
Figure 4.4. Principle of a lift system [Photo: SSI SCH ¨AFER]
Honeycomb rack In a honeycomb system several racks are arranged di-
rectly one behind the other to create shelves with a special depth to take
up long goods. As is usual with line racks a precise warehouse management
and diﬀerent storage and retrieval strategies can be realized by a deﬁnite
assignment of shelves.
Depending on their use, the goods are stored directly in the shelf or on
special load carriers (long size trays or long size troughs). Since these goods
are long and sometimes heavy they have to be handled with special methods
and facilities, e.g., special rack feeders, stackers or cranes. Because of the wide
aisles the system is only suitable for large quantities of articles or goods.
Cantilever rack The goods are placed on cantilever arms which are mounted
at vertical or inclined rack props. The cantilever arms can also be used to

100
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.5. Multi-level shelving system [Photo: BITO]
separate standing goods. Similar to pallet racks continuous shelves can be
built for goods with diﬀerent dimensions by inserting additional shelf plates.
The cantilever system is ideal for the storage of long goods (pipes or rods)
or boards. Usually these racks have a high loading capacity and can thus be
used for universal storage purposes. Because of the ﬂexible use of shelves,
however, the stored goods have to be managed very carefully since the unit
loads may be stored at any location. In line racks each article can be accessed
directly.
The racks are served with diﬀerent systems. In addition to the manual
operation in case of light loads above all stackers and cranes are used. In
some cases the cantilever arms or shelves may also be mobile to allow for a
vertical access (from above).
Statical block rack
In statical block racks the unit loads are combined into a compact block. The
rack arrangement allows for access from just one or two sides. Depending on
whether the system is served from one or two sides the retrieval strategy is
either LIFO or FIFO (cf. section 2.2.3). When units within the block have to
be retrieved the goods have to be restored.

4.1 Warehouse systems
101
Figure 4.6. Drive-in rack [Photo: GEHRING]
The main advantage of this storage technology is that a very high space
utilization without dynamic pressure can be achieved in line with a low space
requirement (because of high storing heights). The unit loads are supported
only at both fronts and therefore have to be of identical width. Because of the
narrow aisles the unit loads have to be dimensionally consistent and stable.
Owing to these characteristics this system is ideal for the storage of large
quantities of a small assortment of articles.
Drive-in and drive-through racks The simplest kind of a statical block
storage system is the drive-in or drive-through rack. The rack supports form
vertical aisles for the rack feeders. Similar to the single bin storage angular
proﬁles are mounted at the supports to hold the unit loads. When the unit
loads are stored and retrieved they are moved slightly above the angle proﬁle.
The system is operated solely with front stackers and accessed from the side.
Two kinds of movement are made to serve the racks:
Drive-in rack The unit loads are stored and retrieved at the same side. This
inevitably requires a LIFO strategy.
Drive-through rack The units are stored and retrieved on opposite sides, this
results in a FIFO strategy. The occupancy of the rack highly depends on
the storage and retrieval frequency. The unit loads cannot be transferred
in the aisles.
Operation and organization Because of these characteristics this system
is not very suitable for the supply of diﬀerent articles but for the storage
of similar articles per aisle and the transshipment of complete units. The
storage locations can be recorded and managed individually; this is diﬃcult
to realize due to the manual operation and the required identiﬁcation of

102
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
locations. However, this principle is ideal for the buﬀering of incoming or
outgoing consignments.
Satellite racks This kind of rack is also called channel rack with satellite.
Below the storage area of a channel there is a driving rail for a satellite or
channel truck which can drive in this channel independently and has access
to the ﬁrst unit in each channel. Thus, more units can be handled than in a
drive-in rack.
In most cases the drive-in method, i.e., LIFO, is used. But a channel
can also be accessed from both sides. Diﬀerent channel trucks are able to
drive under stored units so that FIFO is theoretically possible. To achieve
high occupancy with diﬀerent articles the unit loads have to be restored
frequently.
Operation and organization Automatic satellite vehicles are an ideal
warehouse management tool. Since these vehicles serve the rack system in-
dependently and can be used in large numbers a compact storage can be
achieved in line with a high throughput. However, the more diverse the mix-
ture of articles in the channels (diﬀerent unit loads in one aisle) the more
single picks are necessary and the more restorage and organizational oper-
ations are necessary. This function has to be performed by the warehouse
control. Furthermore, to improve the execution of retrieval orders it is neces-
sary to move single unit loads near the retrieval point already in advance.
4.1.3 Dynamical racking system
For diﬀerent reasons, warehouse systems are designed to be dynamical, i.e.,
the unit loads are moved between storage and retrieval. This oﬀers the fol-
lowing advantages:
– Shorter order-picking distances and higher picking performance
– Higher transshipment in line with a compact storage
– Utilization of the beneﬁts of a block and line storage
There are two basic principles for a dynamical storage: Static unit loads
in mobile racks and mobile unit loads in static racks. The ﬁrst group includes
diﬀerent kinds of ﬂow racks.
Movable aisle systems
This type of rack is a statical line rack extended by a mobile platform, a
so-called subframe. All kinds of rack systems like pallet, container, shelf or
cantilever racks can be mounted on such subframes, but with a limited height
(up to about 10 m). This allows for the sidewise moving of single racks so that
a compact block is built and the aisles disappear (cf. Fig. 4.7). Alternatively,
single racks can be moved (pulled) out at the front of the block.

4.1 Warehouse systems
103
Figure 4.7. Movable aisle systems [Photo: META]
In such a system each single unit load can be accessed when an aisle has
been opened or the rack has been activated. The relatively slow motion of
the large and heavy racks of 3-5 m/min limits the throughput. Therefore,
the storage and retrieval strategy, which should focus on the minimization of
rack movements, has a large eﬀect on the throughput. When ﬂow racks are
used such a function should be part of the warehouse control.
Because of the above-mentioned features a ﬂow rack system is ideal in
cases where a high utilization of space is required in line with a low storage
capacity, e.g., in archives or cold stores.
Rotary racks
Principally, rotary racks are conveyors (cycle or rotary conveyors) with an
increased storage capacity. The aisles may be narrower than in a shelving
system because the turning radius of the vehicles can be minimized. This
method is often used in order-picking systems, which work according to the
principle goods-to-man. The picking performance can be increased consider-
ably by using several rotary racks at once.
Vertical rotary racks (paternoster racks) Turnable troughs are mounted
horizontally at two vertically moving chains. On the one hand, they can take
up small parts but also long goods (cf. Fig. 4.8). The picker is located at the
central transfer point. But it is also possible to include several transfer points
on diﬀerent levels. By utilizing the full height of the room a relatively large
number of articles with a small or medium number per article can be stored
in a small space. The casing of the system serves as operator protection and
prevents unallowed access to the goods.

104
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.8. Vertical rotary rack (Paternoster rack) [Photo: H¨ANEL]
The picking rate of a system largely depends on the building height and
the access frequency. In order to achieve an acceptable performance the ac-
cess sequence has to be adapted to the order of storage locations to avoid
permanent reserve trips.
Horizontal rotary rack (Carousel rack) Single storage ﬁelds are mounted
at a horizontally moving chain to take up a shelf column or similar. The picker
usually retrieves the goods at the turning point at the frontend where several
racks are arranged in parallel. To access a bin the chain is moved until the
respective column or ﬁeld reaches the retrieval point. Several racks (2-3) can
also be mounted on top of each other or in very high systems (about 7 m),
also vertically to save further space. The order-picking resembles that in a
paternoster rack. Because of their length of up to 50 m carousel racks have a
considerably larger storage capacity.
A special type of rotary racks are the so-called rotary container racks.
These systems are mainly used for a short-term buﬀering, e.g., to consolidate
partial orders in the shipping department. While in a classical rotary rack,
single articles or units are retrieved in a rotary container rack the complete
container is removed. For this reason, this type of system requires a high
transshipping performance. Thanks to separate superimposed conveyor lev-
els, each single level can be moved individually. During storage/retrieval the
shelves to be emptied are placed above other shelves so that all operations
can be performed in one step by a central exchange facility (step lift with
multiple grippers).

4.1 Warehouse systems
105
Flow rack
By adding a conveyor level to a ﬁxed block of racks, the unit loads can be
moved within these blocks (also called live storage). For this purpose the
unit loads are either transferred in a storage channel at the rear end of a
rack, moved to the frontend where they are retrieved or are pushed into the
channel at the front end where they are also retrieved (push-in system). In
the channels the units are stored one behind the other and can be accessed
only from the frontend of a rack.
According to the ﬂow principle, storage and retrieval are separated and
thus independent from each other. Furthermore, such systems inevitably work
according to the FIFO principle (or LIFO in case of a push-in system) without
additional controls. An advantage in addition to the compact storage is the
possibility to store many articles with direct access and a guaranteed supply.
The front side of the storage system may also be reduced what leads to shorter
distances during order-picking and operation. Flow racks are used for light
as well as for heavy piece goods.
Of operational importance is the fact that single items or single order
unit loads are built in the single channels. It is almost impossible to restore
units to get access to articles which are not stored at the front end of a rack.
For this reason such systems are only suitable for order-picking where several
units have to be stored without having to provide complete pallets.
Roller pallet systems These systems are a special kind of push-in system
where the unit loads are placed on a roller pallet which are inserted into the
rails in a storage channel. The unit loads within an aisle are coupled to trains
by means of hooks at their frontend which is moved by moving the units
at the aisle-side. Highly dynamical storage and transshipment systems and
mixed channels can be built by providing suﬃcient storage capacity.
4.1.4 Pre-rack zone
Diﬀerent tasks have to be performed in the pre-rack zones. Units to be stored
have to be distributed to aisles, picking places in front of the rack have be
be supplied with staging units and empty containers and, if necessary, the
picking units have to be removed. In addition to this, retrieved units have
to be transported to the shipping department or to be distributed to other
aisles, during an inventory unit loads have to be retrieved for recording and
restored afterwards, etc. This leads to several transport relations and cross-
traﬃcs. The performance of the pre-rack zone is inﬂuenced by two aspects:
An eﬃcient conveyor technology and a suitable control concept.
Used conveyors are roller conveyors, chain conveyors, turning deﬂectors
or sidetracking skates. Depending on the rack feeder the goods are provided
at both ends of the aisle or one upon the other (cf. Fig. 4.10).

106

4.2 Transport systems
The term transport system generally describes technical material ﬂow systems
which are mainly used to move articles. For transport purposes outside the
warehouse and distribution systems so-called traﬃc means are used which are
not discussed here. This book focusses on transport systems for the transport
of piece goods.
Transport systems can be divided into two groups depending on their
operating method:
Conveyors work continuously and are in most cases stationary. They have a
high transport performance measured in items/time units, and generate
a continuous or quasi-continuous transport ﬂow. They oﬀer various pos-
sibilities for diﬀerent routings and the permanent readiness to take up
or transfer articles. Thanks to their continuous operation and easy use,
they can easily be automated and the goods ﬂows are easy to control.
Transporters are single devices which transport single or a few goods from a
source to a target while traveling with the goods. This process is called
working cycle. Depending on the construction type any point along a line,
in an area or room can be approached. For this reason, these systems are
ideal to serve a high number of transfer and pick-up points, to transport
heavy goods and to cover large distances. Depending on the system design

4.2 Transport systems
107

outgoing ﬂows the conveyor routes are arranged separately and on diﬀerent levels
to save space. [Photo: KHT]
the requirements on the control and automation increase in line with the
ﬂexibility of use.
4.2.1 Conveyors
Roller conveyors Roller conveyors move the goods over stationary, turnable
rollers (cf. Fig. 4.11).
The dissipative motion resistance is reduced to the
bearing friction in the roll and to the pressing of the goods while it passes
the rolls. Thus, less energy is used for the transport of piece goods. Goods
are moved manually, on inclined roller conveyors by gravity and by diﬀerent
motor drives. Heavy goods (about 1 t) are driven with chains, while light
goods (<100 kg) are mainly driven with driving belts which are pressed to
the bottom side of the rolls. In addition to steel rolls more and more plastic
rolls are used.
To be transported by a roller conveyor the bottom of the goods has to
be ﬂat and suﬃciently stable. The distance of the rolls has a considerable
inﬂuence on the quality of the movement. The greater the distance the higher
the vibration and thus the higher the strain on the goods.
When the roll shifts the goods this results in a slip according to the
characteristics of the goods to be transported. For this reason, the positions of

108
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.11. Roller conveyor. In the inlet the rolls are tilted to adjust the goods
as shown on the right side of the picture. [Photo: SIEMENS DEMATIC]
the goods on the conveyor line vary and cannot be determined. In automatic
plants it has to be recorded at certain points by sensors (light switches).
When constructed accordingly these systems can also be used as buﬀers.
Since the compression on the goods at the front increases when several goods
are accumulated on a driven conveyor line the waiting rolls have to be de-
activated when the accumulation has reached a certain length. Those types
used for this purpose are called accumulating roller conveyors.
Owing to its simple construction roller conveyors often are a good alter-
native to simple transport tasks. But they are very noisy when the goods hit
the rolls depending on the piece goods as well as the division and bearing of
the rolls.
Belt conveyors The term belt conveyor is a general term for conveyors with
a continuously driven element (belt, strap, lash or meshed wire) to take up
and transport the goods. The goods solidly rest against the belt and do not
move relative to the conveyor so that the movement is smooth, secure and
gentle.
The most commonly used belt conveyor is the so-called conveying belt
[83] with a belt wide enough to completely take up the goods to be conveyed.
Rolls or plates are mounted below the belt to support the weight of the
belt and of the goods. The goods to be conveyed should meet the following
requirements:

4.2 Transport systems
109
Figure 4.12. Conveying belt: Helical curve [Photo: AXMANN]
– Take up tension forces with only little elongation
– Little bending resistance during turning
– Little friction on the lower side of the belt (running side) to reduce the
required driving force; but suﬃcient friction to transfer the driving forces
to the driving drum
– According to the use diﬀerent friction values on the upper side of the belt
(carrying side)
To meet all these requirements composite materials are used. Inlays from
polyamide, polyester or aramide are used to take up the tension forces. Rub-
ber or plastic insertions connect the outer layers which should also make the
belt more resistant against wear and tear and environmental eﬀects.
Conveying belts are used to transport light piece goods of up to about
50 kg. A suitable combination of belt and carrying construction can help to
reduce the noise level drastically. In addition to the more common straight
lines also curved systems can be realized by means of a lateral belt support
(cf. Fig. 4.12).
Conveying belt systems can be controlled accurately and are highly dy-
namical because the transported goods seat solidly on the belt thanks to
the high friction value. With this method, inclines can also be managed

(cf.Fig. 4.12). Accumulating conveyors are built with very small belts or lashes
where the goods are lifted by the lash during the accumulation.
Chain conveyor The characteristic element of a chain conveyor is a chain
as carrying and/or pulling device. A chain has a high loading capacity, a
small turning radius and can easily be equipped with additional elements.
For this reason, it is widely used in conveying and storage systems (cf. section
4.1.3). The most commonly used chain conveyors are listed in Table 4.2. More
detailed information about the single principles can be found in [40].
4.2.2 Transporters
While in a steady conveying system the complete line is designed for the heav-
iest or most sensible goods the dimensioning of a transporter system mainly
focusses on the design of the transport means. This reduces investments in
driving routes. Furthermore, diﬀerent kinds of vehicles can be operated within

4.2 Transport systems
111
Figure 4.13. Chain conveyor: Flexible link conveyor for light piece goods (Carrying
chain conveyor) [Photo: FLEXLINK]
a larger system as long as the requirements are met. Transporters are divided
into two basic types according to their movability.
Freely movable The conveyors can freely move on the level. The third di-
mension is served by extensions or lifts. The free choice of motions puts
high requirements on the vehicle control: Determination of the location
in the room, operating and traﬃc situations adapted to the driving style
or operation, anti-collision, etc. For this reason, the system is mainly con-
trolled by the human workforce because their cognitive skills could only
be simulated by a sophisticated control similar to that used in automated
guided transport systems.
Controlled movable The conveyors are guided on (ﬂoor-mounted) rails which
are propped up on supports or arranged ﬂoor-free outside the working
area. Since an active steering is not required the control can be minimized.
Most guided transporters are especially suited for automation.

112
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.14. Diﬀerent ﬂoor conveyors in a warehouse [Photo: JUNGHEINRICH]
Floor conveyors
This is a generic term for all ﬂoor-bound transporter systems. The diﬀerent
tasks have a large inﬂuence on the design of the ﬂoor conveyors:
– Transport of piece goods over short or long distances
– Transshipment of piece goods between work equipment or exchange be-
tween work stations
– Stacking of piece goods and, if required, transport of stacked units
– Rack serving: storage/retrieval of piece goods in/from the rack and order-
picking in the rack area.
Diﬀerent types of ﬂoor conveyors are used depending on the frequency of
one or several jobs. Simple transport jobs are performed by trucks or tractors
with trailers (transport devices), which require an additional conveyor or a
human being to be loaded and unloaded. Universal devices or universal trans-
shipment devices can take up unit loads independently and move them to the
transfer point or storage bin for automatic storage. Special storage devices
are used to improve the space utilization and the transshipping or picking
performance. These devices have narrow aisles, high-bay storage facilities or
articles can be picked at the rack front. But at the same time they put high
requirements on the quality of the ground and cannot be used universally.
Transport devices The mainly electrically driven trucks and tractors are
used for regular transports over long distances. They are more economical

4.2 Transport systems
113
Figure 4.15. Tractor [Photo: STILL]
than fork lift trucks and bear fewer risks since the driver has a better view
on his route.
For lower loads tricycles are used (up to about 8,5 kN tension forces, cf.
Fig. 4.15) which have an undriven and controlled front wheel. Single devices
are highly maneuvrable. In case of coupled trainsets (tractor with several
trailers) the wheel guidance of the trailers is decisive for the width of the line.
Trailers with only one controlled axle have a constricted cornering ability so
that the width of the line has to be increased in line with the number of
trailers. To keep the trainset on the path of the tractor the device has to be
equipped with a four-wheel control with coupled axles.
Transshipment devices The main characteristic of a transshipment device
is its ability to independently take up and transfer unit loads. Small trans-
shipment volumes are handled with manual devices like carts, trolleys and
pallet lift trucks. The widely used pallet lift trucks are designed for standard
pallets (Euro and industrial pallet). When weights and transshipment fre-
quencies increase, however, it is uneconomical to just use human resources so
that the system is motorized in several steps.
In addition to the drive and lift the trucks are equipped with driver’s
cabins and seats to increase the transport speed. For order-picking the pallet
lift trucks are also equipped with an elevating platform for the picker so that
the second rack level can be served as well.
Stackers are used when access to higher levels or stacking is required
in addition to the take-up and transfer of unit loads on ground level. The
most common type is the fork lift truck (also front stacker, balanced fork lift
trucks, cf. Fig. 4.16). A vertical lifting frame with forks is mounted on a three
or four-wheel body, which takes up the load outside the wheel basis of the
fork lift truck. To increase the loading capacity a counterbalance is ﬁxed at
the side opposite to the load.

114
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.16. Front lift truck loading/unloading a truck [Photo: JUNGHEINRICH]
To achieve the maximum lifting heights in line with low vehicle heights
the lifting frames are telescopic. A U-shaped proﬁle holds an internal frame
which can take up further frames. The lift is moved by chain hoists which are
activated by hydraulic cylinders at the side or in the center. The complete
lifting frame is moved towards the goods and analogously towards the vehicle
to transport the unit load securely on the forks. In addition to the admissible
load and the maximum lifting height the free lift, i.e., the maximum lifting
height of the forks without telescoping the mast, is a decisive factor for the
functionality of a lifting mast since it determines whether the truck can also
be operated in low rooms. Goods are always taken up and transferred at
the frontend. The preferred driving direction is the forward direction (fork in
front) so that in case of large loads the view may be obstructed. The large
variety of accessories and extensions allows for a use other than the mere
transport and transshipment.
Tricycles have a single controlled wheel at the side opposed to the load
so that their turning radius is small. Four-wheel trucks have a swing axle on
the side opposed to the load to increase the loading capacity. They are more
stable (above all tilting resistant) but have a larger curve radius. Since the
front fork lift truck has to turn by 90◦to take up and transfer the goods the
width of the warehouse aisles largely depends on the undercarriage and the
possible load of a truck.
For in-house operations mostly electric stackers are used while diesel-
driven stackers are used for outdoor activities. In mixed operation (in-house
and outdoor) stackers driven with LPG (Liquiﬁed Petroleum Gasoline) can be
used in addition to electric lift trucks. Another decisive factor for an outdoor
use are the tyres.

4.2 Transport systems
115
Figure 4.17. Straddle stacker [Photo: STILL]
Storage devices this group includes all ﬂoor conveyors which are used
mainly for rack feeding purposes.
Straddle stackers have two cantilever arms which are arranged below the
load, e.g., below the forks (cf. Fig. 4.17). If the load has to be taken up from
the ground, the distance of the wheel arms or straddles has to be adapted to
the size of the unit load or the notches of a pallet. When the distance is too
small the goods cannot be taken up from the ground and the unit load can
only be taken up from a shelf when it has a lower free size of about 250 mm.
Since the unit loads are handled or transported within the wheel base the
fork lift truck needs no counterbalance and therefore is much shorter. The
trucks normally have a three-wheel drive.
To take up units from the ground regardless of their width fork lift reach
trucks have a mobile lifting mast which is moved along the wheel arms for load
take-up (cf. Fig. 4.18). During transport the lifting mast is pulled back with
the load to a stable position. Another alternative to straddle stackers are reach
fork trucks which are seldom used today. The fork lift can be moved along
the lift mast and extended to the front position for load take-up/transfer so
that double-deep stored unit loads can be retrieved as well (cf. Fig. 4.19).

The diﬀerent types of wheel arm stackers require considerably smaller
aisles than counterbalanced stackers. Since the load units are handled at the
frontend the stacker has to be turned by 90◦what calls for an aisle width of
≥3 m. To reduce the aisle width stackers are used which are able to take up
the unit loads sidewise to avoid a turning in the rack system:
High-bay stacker These stackers are also called side loading fork lift trucks
or three-side loading fork lift trucks. Telescopic forks or a rotating fork
lift are mounted to the lift frame which can move the forks to both
sides (retractable swivel fork – cf. Fig. 4.20). According to the type the
retractable swivel fork can also be moved in the rack aisle.
High-bay stackers can serve racks up to a height of about 12 m. Unit loads
can only be securely retrieved in such a height with the help of auxiliary
means. For this purpose, the high-bay stackers are guided mechanically or
inductively in the rack aisle. In front of the racks the forks are positioned
by means of automatic shelf selection systems or camera systems.
Order-picking stacker Unlike a high-bay stacker the order-picking stacker or
high-lift stacker is equipped with an operator’s cabin which can be lifted
by the fork directly at the lifting mast so that the picker can retrieve the
unit loads directly from the shelves. The units are built by approaching

4.2 Transport systems
117

single shelves according to the man to goods principle. Some types are
solely used for the picking of partial quantities and are unsuitable for
the storage/retrieval of complete unit loads. For this reason, their fork is
rigid and cannot be swiveled. Other order-picking stackers can be used
to build partial units as well as to retrieve complete unit loads. These
stackers have all the features of a high-bay stacker.
Side fork lift truck This type is ideal for the handling of long goods in can-
tilever arm racks. A crosswise traveling lift frame is mounted on a four-
wheel trolley similar to a fork lift reach truck. These goods can be placed
on the trolley for a secure transport. With this method also long goods
can be handled quickly and longer distances can be covered without prob-
lems.
Four-directional lift truck Its construction is similar to that of a fork lift
reach truck. But instead of the two rigid front rolls this stacker has driven
rotary wheel motors so that it has at least two controllable wheel units (cf.
Fig. 4.22). This allows the stacker to move in any direction, i.e., length-
wise and crosswise as well as to make traverse trips. The stacker must
not be turned to take up goods since it enters the aisle crosswise to the
load take-up position.

Selection criteria In order to ﬁnd the optimal ﬂoor transporter the com-
plete task at hand has to be considered as well as the design of the warehouse
and order-picking system and the transporter technology. Other aspects are
the required transshipping and transport performance and their forecast de-
velopment. On the one hand, the performance of a transporter system can
principally be adapted to the number of transporters, but this rule does not
apply for warehouses with narrow aisles where the vehicles cannot move or
only one vehicle can be operated per aisle. Furthermore, the investment and
operating costs increase in line with the specialization of the conveying sys-
tem and have to be set oﬀthe achieved savings of space.
Because of the various side conditions, it is impossible to securely deter-
mine the proﬁtability of single vehicles.
Operation and organization To eﬃciently use transporters pending or-
ders have to be executed in such a way that prioritized orders are handled
ﬁrst, empty trips are minimized and existing resources are optimally utilized.
A suﬃciently experienced employee (stacker driver) may optimize his work
sequence if he knows the order batches. And a dispatcher (control station
assistant) can manually control certain optimization tasks.

4.2 Transport systems
119

This no longer makes sense when many vehicle units are operated in a
dynamical environment with a short-term order lead time. In such cases the
overall system can only be optimized by continuously recording the system
status in line with the current job status of the single conveyors and their
targets. To ensure a ﬂexible and dynamical reaction each single unit has to be
accessible at any time. For this purpose the system has to communicate with
the decentralized operating units. Furthermore, the trips of the order-picking
stacker between the retrieval positions in the rack system have to be reduced.
The optimization of the overall system requires a superordinate control
system which controls the order management. The functioning and strate-
gies of such a transport management system have already been discussed in
section 2.3.3.
Another important factor is the documentation of ﬁnished work steps. Er-
rors can be analyzed by means of reconstructed sub-processes so that arising
problems (e.g., wrong article in the shelf, shortages despite of goods received,
etc.) can be solved without an intensive error search. A prerequisite for this
error analysis is the tracking and tracing of the material ﬂow process (cf.

120
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.22. Four-directional lift truck [Photo: STILL]
section 2.3.4), which can best be achieved by considering the conveyors as
temporary storage locations. Materials in transit are traceable at any time
which is of special importance with regard to time-critical supply processes.
Automated guided vehicle systems Since these transporters are highly
ﬂexible they are diﬃcult to automate. For this reason, such an automated
system not only includes the vehicle control but also the stationary control
with the vehicle and system control and the communication and safety facil-
ities. The aim of such a system is to automatically transport the goods with
transporters without the direct intervenience of the staﬀ.
Regardless of the high technical expenditure automated guided vehicles
(AGV) are used for diﬀerent reasons:
– Transports in dangerous areas to improve operational safety
– Fulﬁlment of high requirements on the conveyors with regard to precision,
repetition accuracy or strict observance of movement sequences, e.g., during
the transport of large goods in restricted areas
– Reduction of labour costs, above all in multiple-shift operation
– Transparent processes
– Avoidance of transport damages
– Avoidance of ﬂoor installations in favour of rail-bound systems

4.2 Transport systems
121
Nowadays, all common transporters are also available as automated
guided vehicles (AGV). The processes are optimized according to the same
principles as for manual systems.
Cross-transporting vehicles
Cross-transporting vehicles, also called distribution cars or mobile carts, are
ﬂoor-bound and rail-bound transport vehicles with a load suspension device
(roller or chain conveyor) for the independent take-up and transfer of unit
loads. They move between ﬁxed transfer points, combine diﬀerent inputs and
outputs and serve as sorter and distribution device. They are frequently used
for the distribution of goods in a pre-rack zone where they are an inexpensive
alternative to conveyors.
Since cross-transporting vehicles usually are the connecting element be-
tween several facilities its performance has to be studied very carefully. To
ensure a suﬃcient system performance the vehicles are optimized with regard
to acceleration and speed. Another important aspect are driving strategies,
which are adapted to the special application and give equal consideration to
the choice of the shortest connections and to the date of the order. If required,
an appropriate idle position has to be considered as well.
Rack feeders
Rack feeders are rail-bound conveyors for the serving of line racks (cf.
Fig. 4.23). Thanks to rack feeders the constructional height of pallet racks
and thus the space utilization could be increased. Typical systems reach a
height of up to 50 m with an aisle length of 150 m.
Structure A rack feeder consists of two masts, a vertically traveling lift
equipped with one or several load suspension devices (LSD) and a carriage.
The rack feeder is guided by a ground and an overhead rail and driven by a
wheel and disk gear or a synchronous belt drive, in some cases with ropes.
Traction belts use stationary belts and mobile drives which are mounted on
the carriage as well as stationary, external drive and mobile belts ﬁxed at
the stacker. To avoid vibrations the length of the traction belts is limited to
the medium aisle length. Highly dynamical facilities may have an additional
drive at the upper guide.
Rack feeders can be used for all types of racks served from the frontend
(pallet and container racks as well as ﬂow/ push racks). They can also be
used in block storage systems, e.g., to transfer channel or satellite vehicles
between the single channels.
Load take-up The type and number of the load suspension device on a
lift truck have a decisive inﬂuence on the performance and functioning of
the system as well as on the design of the system interfaces. The basic load
suspension device principle is determined by the form and weight of the unit

122
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.23. Rack feeder for pallet handling [Photo: ST¨OCKLIN SIEMAG]
load. Pallets (loads >300 kg) are generally placed into the shelf with telescopic
forks what avoids relative movements between shelf and unit load. The load
transfer and positioning times are very long due to sequential movements
(positioning of shelf – extending fork – lifting lift truck – retracting fork).
Because of the linear loading aid telescopic forks cannot be used for the
handling of heavy loads which need a continuous and broad support (esp.
air cargo – unit load devices ULD). For this purpose, roller conveyors are
used as a load suspension device as well as at the shelf. This reduces the load
transfer times but for cost reasons is only used for the above-mentioned unit
loads without a suﬃciently stable loading aid.
Light piece goods, however, (trays, containers; cf. section 4.1.2) can be
transferred in many ways because they can among others, easily be pulled
(a suﬃciently smooth and level bottom of the unit load and a low-friction
shelf storage provided). Diﬀerent types of load suspension devices are shown
in Fig. 4.24.

Control and operation The eﬃcient operation of rack feeders requires the
realtime control of their functions. For this purpose, own system controls in
the form of autark material ﬂow controls and subordinate facility controls
are used to perform and optimize the movements on the ﬁeld level. The
strategies for the bin assignment (cf. Table 2.2) and retrieval (cf. Table 2.4)
are represented in the material ﬂow control as well as the department-speciﬁc
bin management.
Special constructions Stacker cranes are the linking element between a
rack feeder and a bridge crane. A vertical mast with the functions of a rack
feeder mast (load guidance, lifting platform and load suspension device) are
mounted at the trolley The main diﬀerence is that the system is suspended
without ground installations so that it can also be used for movable aisle sys-
tems (cf. section 4.1.3). This principle resembles that of the so-called Trans-
Faster, which is equipped with a suspended load suspension device mounted
at the trolley. The trolley moves in an aisle on lateral rails like a channel
vehicle so that several vehicles can move in an aisle on diﬀerent levels.
The “lifting bar system” is a rack feeder rotated by 90◦. The mast is a
horizontal lifting bar guided on vertical rails. The lifting platform moves on

124
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
this bar analogous to the trolley of the load suspension device. Owing to this
technology, the number of carried drives can be reduced and the dynamic of
the system increased although only in smaller warehouse systems.
Electric trolley conveyor
Electric trolley conveyors are ﬂoor-free automatic transporters. Electrically
driven individual vehicles move along a rail which is suspended from the
ceiling or mounted on pillars and powered via contact lines. The goods are
transported by means of load suspension gears, gripping traverses or diﬀer-
ent kinds of hooks and lifting devices at the bottom of the vehicle. The load
suspension gears may also be equipped with active load suspension devices
(roller conveyors, chain conveyors) to optimize the load transfer and for the
distribution of piece goods. In warehouse applications electric trolley convey-
ors are often used to connect diﬀerent function areas (e.g., goods receipt and
high-bay rack).
An electric trolley conveyor is a universal conveying system. It is loaded
in idle condition so that also large and heavy goods can safely be transferred.
With a driving speed of up to 2 m/s, it easily covers long distances and
achieves high throughput rates. Extensive networks can be built by means of
crossings and connections (turrets, two/three-way switches, parallel switches)
as well as inclines/declines and lifting devices. In case of heavy loads and
high throughput rates climbing aids can be used at inclines to reduce the
technical expenditure at the single carriages which can manage 90◦inclines
with light loads. With a respective number of vehicles or parallel buﬀer lines
also buﬀering tasks can be performed. The typical standard load for a vehicle
is 300-1000 kg in addition to systems with a smaller or higher load. To increase
the load single carriages are coupled by connecting at least one driven vehicle
with one or several undriven carriages.
The necessary commands are transmitted either via the contact line or
via radio or infrared transmission. In future, also contact-free transmission
methods (inductive) will be used to minimize the wear and tear. In addition
to the vehicle control (e.g., load transfer, distance control to preceding vehi-
cles) a system computer controls the rail network (switches, etc.) and special
sections to avoid deadlocks (right of way at complex sections) and to optimize
the system performance (also block sections).
Special constructions Special types of an electric trolley conveyor are the
electric carrying conveyor (ECC)
and the electric pallet conveyor (EPC)
(cf. [93]). Both run on ﬂoor-mounted rails similar to an electric trolley con-
veyor; the electric pallet conveyor moves on two parallel rails. The goods to
be conveyed are transported above the carriage so that this system can bet-
ter be integrated into certain applications. Both systems are controlled and
organized like an electric trolley conveyor.

4.2 Transport systems
125
Cranes
Cranes are classical goods handling devices and mainly used to transfer goods
between diﬀerent transport means and for the handling of heavy goods. A
major feature of all cranes is that they are ﬂoor-free and can move in nearly
all directions without traﬃc routes.
Cranes can be divided into linear moving cranes with a cuboid working
area and rotary cranes with a cylindrical working area. For outdoor use diﬀer-
ent kinds of vehicle cranes are used which are not discussed here any further
[85]. Cranes with a cuboid working area are:
Bridge cranes Lateral rails are mounted above the working area (crane
paths) which are directly supported by the building. The crane bridge
spans the complete working area and moves on lateral front supports. The
trolley moves above, parallel to and below the crane bridge and carries
the load suspension device (rope or chain lift). Sidewise mounted angle
trolleys induce a torsion moment into the crane bridge which is otherwise
inﬂected. This minimizes the crane height and increases the working area.
The movements and indication of forces into the crane path are achieved
by steel wheels.
Suspension cranes Other than at bridge cranes the rails are mounted at the
ceiling so that the crane hangs completely below the rails. This enlarges
the working area since the trolley can also operate below the rail and can
also move to other hall areas.
Stacker cranes Stacker cranes are based on a bridge or suspension crane but
instead of a rope or chain lift they have a ﬁxed, sometimes telescopable
mast to prevent a swinging of the load suspension device. For this reason
stacker cranes are highly suitable for rack feeding or dynamical diagonal
drives.
Portal cranes If the crane bridge cannot be supported by the building it can
be mounted on own supports on the ﬂoor. According on the size one
support is a pendulum support to avoid tensions at the edges by heat
or tolerances in the crane path. Due to the large mass and form of the
supports fewer dynamical movements are possible compared to a bridge
crane.
Wall crane The wall crane moves horizontally to a vertical wall and abuts
into the working area. The rails are superimposed and designed only
for small loads and goods of protruding length. The system can also be
operated below another bridge crane.
Cranes with a cylindrical working area operate with a rotating cantilever
arm. This may either be rotatable or equipped with a trolley to operate
diﬀerent parts of the working area. Indoor rotary cranes are only used in
the form of slewing pillar cranes in industry and are of minor importance

126
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
in warehouse and distribution systems. Outdoors diﬀerent kinds of rotary
cranes are used at harbor quays and construction sites.
Cranes in warehouse systems Cranes are mainly used in warehouses to
handle heavy piece goods like steel coils, paper rolls, steel boards or special
long goods. These goods are mostly stored in block storage systems which
are operated from above. Automated systems are often used for this purpose
because the operation and warehouse management is diﬃcult for the rea-
sons mentioned in section 4.1.1 (cf. p. 93). This requires an automatic load
suspension device (magnetic or suction gripper or pliers) such as a suitable
swing control. The crane must only be operated automatically in blocked
areas without personnel.
In this case the storage bins have to be managed exactly since the goods
have diﬀerent dimensions and the bins vary according to the stacks. Further-
more, the sequence of stacks has to be considered as well. The throughput
depends on the storage strategies and the required restorage. Cranes are also
used for rack feeding (automatic as well as manual) whereas the requirements
on the control are the same as on rack feeders. Furthermore, cranes are also
used as transshipping devices in the goods receipt and issue where single
goods as well as unit loads like containers are handled.
4.3 Sorting and distribution systems
Sorting and distribution system, in short sorters, are automatic devices which
are used to distribute a large number of goods according to special criteria
within a short period of time. Single processes can also be performed manu-
ally.
Because of increasing requirements on throughput times and operating
costs but also due to changing shipping structures like frequent just-in-time
deliveries of small quantities these systems are of growing importance. In
the following the elementary structures and distribution principles will be
described.
4.3.1 Applications
The requirements on the distribution process with regard to warehousing and
distribution vary considerably depending on the application:
Transshipment for mail and parcel services Here, incoming streams have to
be distributed immediately to outgoing tours. Regionally collected con-
signments are brought by vans to so-called hubs where they are dis-
tributed to other hubs as well as to regional deliveries leaving from the
same hub. Because of the short delivery times the consignment has to be

4.3 Sorting and distribution systems
127
handled within a few hours. The priority of the sorting order depends on
the distance to the destination.
The incoming and outgoing goods ﬂows or assignments are mostly deter-
mined. The single consignments always have a clearly deﬁned destination.
The transshipment systems have to cope with high load peaks and pulsat-
ing delivery quantities. The range of articles is very large and inhomoge-
neous because they are manufactured by the shipper, i.e., outside the sys-
tem. Guidelines refer to the weight and dimensions of the goods (admissi-
ble circumference of the girth plus the length often=length+2×width+2×
height=3000mm).
Order-picking systems The automatic distribution is an elementary part of
two-step order-picking systems (cf. section 2.2.5). The customer orders
which are consolidated into batches in the ﬁrst step are separated for
shipment. Since the number of daily customer orders often exceeds the
possible number of ﬁnal stations they are combined into batches which
are executed successively. Thus, the articles are reassigned during each
run. Furthermore, it is not possible to clearly assign a single unit since
the same article may be requested for diﬀerent orders2 and may thus be
assigned to diﬀerent destinations. For this reason, the performance also
depends on the application of suitable assignment rules.
Also one-step order-parallel order-picking systems can be rationalized
with sorters. The consolidation of sub-orders into shipping orders (con-
tainer sorting) puts other requirements on the distribution system: the
goods to be sorted are consolidated quantities (containers, cardboard
boxes), the throughput is relatively small and the quantities to be
buﬀered at the ﬁnal stations (often returns) are relatively large.
Sorting of returns Returns put special requirements on the goods receipt and
have to be treated specially by the system (cf. section 2.2.1). When re-
turned goods are restored they are distributed to the single warehouse
areas. They can also be directly entered into the current order-picking
process to avoid storage processes.
Baggage handling The most critical parameters at all airports is the mini-
mum connecting time, MCT to guarantee for the secure transfer of lug-
gage to connecting ﬂights. At large airports these short process times
can only be achieved with extensive conveyor systems with a sorting and
distributing function. Special care has to be given to the goods to be
sorted (baggage) which cannot be deﬁned in detail with regard to their
form and characteristics. These goods may be of any form and stability
and have loops, belts, handles, etc.
2 This condition is the intended aim of this principle to reduce picking distances
in the ﬁrst step (article-wise order-picking).

128
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
4.3.2 The basic structure of sorting systems
An evident characteristic of sorters is the distribution line with the corre-
sponding techniques. A safe functioning requires the ﬁve up- and downstream
features [91]:
– System input
– Preparation
– Identiﬁcation
– Distribution
– System output
System input
The main task of the system input is to adapt the working characteristics
of the sorter to the upstream system. Pulsating input ﬂows, for example,
have to be coordinated with the ﬁxed distribution rate of constantly working
distribution systems. This can only be achieved with lines for the unloading
of incoming transporters oﬀering suﬃcient buﬀering capacity.
In larger order-picking systems the just-in-time handling and provision of
picking batches cannot be ensured without problems. It may thus be neces-
sary to buﬀer several batches in front of the sorter to decouple the ﬁrst from
the second level.
Preparation
An automatic system generally is the more eﬃcient the more limited the
degree of freedom of the objects to be handled. This also applies to the
distribution. Depending on the system sorting and distribution systems oﬀer
the following functions:
Decollation It needs deﬁned intervals for the uninterrupted recording and
allocation of a sequence of goods. This can be achieved, for example, by
two series connected conveyors with a conveying speed of v1 < v2.
Adjustment To ensure the precise discharging the goods are adjusted on the
distribution conveyor in diﬀerent directions to the distribution loop. In
case of bumpers or swivel roller conveyors the goods have to be positioned
at the outer edge of the conveyor, e.g., by mounting roller conveyor sec-
tions with inclined or conical rolls. In case of single-slot conveyors the
space in the trough and possibly at the terminal can better be used
when the goods are placed lengthwise. For this purpose charging and
feeding conveyors are arranged in a corresponding angle to each other or
a manual feeder is used.
Another elementary prerequisite for the secure identiﬁcation of the goods
is a failure-free sorting. During diﬀerent processes, however, the location
of the identiﬁcation mark may be random. To avoid the use of expensive
all-side scanners (scanner bridges) the identiﬁcation marks should best

4.3 Sorting and distribution systems
129
be positioned in direction of the scanner. This is mostly done manually
but sometimes also by automatically tilting the goods into the correct
position.
Applying additional information When piece goods cannot be diﬀerentiated
by means of their dimensions, weight, design or barcodes they have to be
tagged with additional physical or logical information.
Weight scan The weight scan is used to avoid an overload of the sorter or to
identify picking errors.
Identiﬁcation
The goods to be sorted are usually identiﬁed by means of barcodes, mainly
in plain writing. These barcodes can be scanned at diﬀerent positions, at the
feeder or after they have been charged into the sorting loop. The earlier the
barcode is scanned to better react to errors. Furthermore, the slow feeding
speed improves the scan rate or allows for the use of several scanners.
If the goods are not marked with a code diﬀerent manual identiﬁcation
methods can be used. Mail services, for example, manually enter the target
code and then place the goods on the charger. In case of a mixed range of
articles (with or without destination data on the label) more and more large
systems operate with telecoding. Here, a camera is installed at the identiﬁca-
tion point which transfers the images to an external workstation. This not
only reduces the error rate because of a better ergonomics but also increases
the utilization of the human resources. The distance between the scanner
and the decision point has to be large enough (processing time about 20 s.).
Voice-coding is of growing importance because it enables the picker to grip the
goods with both hands. Pick-to-voice systems are used in parcel distribution
centers to enter zip codes or routing codes but also for the order-picking of
articles (cf. section 2.2.5). Mail services more and more use the plain writing
identiﬁcation which integrates other methods (telecoding) in case of prob-
lems.
Distribution
The structure of a distribution system is categorized according to the follow-
ing criteria:
– Arrangement in lines or loops
– Number and arrangement of the feeding stations
– Distribution and discharging principle
In line structures the goods are charged and distributed on a straight line
(cf. Fig. 4.25, a+b). According to the distribution principle the conveyor may
be deﬂected vertically at the end of the line which may thus be shortened.
Undischarged goods (e.g., because of congested chutes) have to be returned
to the charging station at the beginning of the line by additional standard
conveyors where they have to be recharged.

130
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
Figure 4.25. Arrangement in lines and loops
In a looped system the course is an endless horizontal loop (cf. Fig. 4.25,
c+d). The terminals and above all the feeding terminals may be placed any-
where along the loop. If goods cannot be discharged at the deﬁned terminal
they can remain on the loop without renewed identiﬁcation and charging and
be discharged the next time they reach their terminal. Other than the line
system this requires a long and expensive distribution route.
Goods can be charged from three diﬀerent directions
1. Vertically from above
2. Horizontally in conveying direction at the beginning of the conveyor line
3. Horizontally from the side of the conveyor line
The goods cannot be charged freely but mainly according to the chosen
distribution principle. Some distribution systems can only be charged from
above, from the front or from the side (cf. section 4.3.3). A lateral and vertical
feeding may lead to an increased system performance when several feeding
stations are arranged in line. In addition to this, conveyor lines coming from
other areas can directly be connected to the system. When a system is charged
horizontally in conveying direction the complete ﬂow has to be consolidated
onto one conveyor line.
The increase in performance to be achieved by diagonally arranged charg-
ing terminals (cf. Fig. 4.25, d) depends on the pretreatment of the goods ﬂow,
the reaction of the single stations and the recirculation ratio (average share
of cycling goods). In the ideal case the goods ﬂow is presorted in such a
way that the goods charged in a certain section can directly be discharged
at the next chute without having to pass the next charging station. Thus,
a multiple station occupance of the distribution line can be achieved. If, on
the other hand, mixed ﬂows are charged at diﬀerent points of the loop the
possible global increase in performance cannot be forecast because of the
above-mentioned parameters.
On the one hand, a distribution principle can be described according to
the assignment of sub-sections. In single slot sorting systems the distribution
conveyor is divided into discrete sections (trays) which take up one piece good
each. The theoretical distribution rate is determined by the division of the

trays and the conveying speed. In certain facilities single elements can also
be coupled to take up oversized goods. In facilities with free occupancy the
distribution conveyor can be charged at random so that the distance between
the goods can be optimized. This is of special advantage in case of largely
varying articles.
On the other hand, the functioning of the distribution technology is de-
ﬁned by the active principle of the discharging mechanism. Current systems
work according to the following principle:
Charging and discharging systems The goods to be sorted lie on a conveyor
and are discharged by its movements. Since there is no movement relative
to the conveyor the goods can be discharged precisely and gently.
Diverting systems The goods are lifted oﬀthe conveyor by a separate el-
ement. The positive ﬁt between the good and the charger ensure the
secure discharging. Depending on the design the strain on the goods may
be considerable.
Force ﬁeld-based systems The systems make use of the gravity and sometimes
of the centrifugal force to discharge the goods so that the number of drives
can be reduced. The discharging process depends on the characteristics
of the goods (weight, density, situation of the center of gravity, sliding
characteristics) and cannot be used for all types of goods.
The allocation of commonly used distribution methods according to this
classiﬁcation is shown in Fig. 4.26.

132
4. Warehousing and Conveying Principles
System output
There are various requirements on the destinations or chutes:
– The required order volume has to be securely stored
– The goods have to be conveyed safely after each breakdown at any degree
of occupancy
– The goods have to be quickly discharged from the sorter to discharge as
many goods as possible at the same destination
– The speed at the terminals and the resulting accumulating pressure must
not be too high
– Little space required
– Easy discharging by the packing staﬀ(ergonomic gripping height, no push-
ing of goods).
Because of their frequent use the system terminals require high investment
costs. For this reason it is important to determine the most suitable technol-
ogy and dimensions for a terminal. This is done by the following methods:
– Chutes (even chutes, stepped chutes, spiral chutes)
– Roller conveyors (driven or braked)
– Caster conveyors
– Belt conveyors
– Containers, troughs, roller containers
– Bags and shipping boxes
For cost reasons chutes are used for this purpose (cf. Fig. 4.27). To in-
tegrate the technology into the existing system, it should be connectable
to succeeding processes. Active terminals such as roller conveyors or belt
conveyors allow for an automatic handling. Passive terminals (often chutes,
containers, etc.) are discharged by the staﬀand released for the following
sorting job. This work step is of special importance for the performance of
the overall system because the sequence of the terminals and routes between
the terminals has to be optimized. In order to utilize the limited resource
packer to the optimum optical status messages have to be integrated and, if
necessary, suitable operating strategies have to be deﬁned.
4.3.3 Distribution technology
Cross-belt sorters, tilt tray sorters and sliding sorters are frequently used for
the distribution of classical piece goods. These sorters are described in the
following. Other systems are described in [40]. In addition to the sorting of
piece goods sorters are also used in mail services. Further special solutions
are used, for example, for the sorting of hanging goods.

4.3 Sorting and distribution systems

Figure 4.27. Terminals: chutes [Photo: BEUMER]
Cross-belt sorters Belt-conveyors are mounted on a chain crosswise to the
conveying direction. These conveyors are designed for the maximum load unit
size (cf. Fig. 4.28). Each belt conveyor can be moved separately. When the
goods are charged sidewise the belt conveyor typically is moved synchronously
to the feeding belt and the goods are transferred without a relative movement.
The goods are discharged at both sides by activating the belt conveyor at the
terminals. The belt conveyors are driven by positively driven controls as well
as by single drives. In more expensive systems with single drives the driving
and belt movements are completely decoupled so that not only the position
of the goods on the conveyor can be readjusted but also the drop line as well
as the position of the goods at the terminal. The complete chain is driven
mechanically by chains, drag or worm gears or linear drives. The chains can
be deﬂected horizontally as well as vertically so that the system can be used
in loop or line systems.
Tilt tray sorters This single-slot system mainly makes use of the gravity
force to discharge the goods. It also consists of a series of single elements
(cars). Each car has a platform (tray) which can be tilted sidewise to the
conveyor so that goods can be discharged at both sides (cf. Fig. 4.29). In case
of the common sidewise charging the goods are decelerated by the friction in
the tray (possibly supported by lateral guides). The system is activated at

Figure 4.29. Tilt tray sorter [Photo: BEUMER]
the terminals by stationary switch cams. In addition to this, newer systems
also have individual electrical drives for each tray so that the driving and
discharging movement can be decoupled to achieve a more ﬂexible goods
transfer. The kind of the tilting movement can also inﬂuence the discharging
process. The major aim is to reduce the width of the terminals. The drive
and deﬂection are the same as in a cross-belt conveyor.
Sliding shoe sorter Two vertically rotating chains are equipped with bars
or proﬁles (carrying elements) to take up and transport the goods. A movable
element (slider) is mounted at each carrying element which is controlled by
a positively driven control below the carrying elements (cf. Fig. 4.30). The

4.3 Sorting and distribution systems
135
Figure 4.30. Sliding shoe sorter (Posisorter (R)) [Photo: VANDERLANDE IN-
DUSTRIES]
sliders can be moved on rails and switches in such a way that the goods on
the carrying element are moved into the terminal. By preadjusting the sliders
in the return run of the conveyor chain, the goods can be discharged at both
sides. The positively driven discharge allows for the handling of a wide range
of articles, except goods with straps and very small goods (<150mm). The
system is arranged in lines and the goods are charged at the front, horizontally
at the beginning of the distribution line.
4.3.4 Control and strategies
A sorting and distribution system is a complex part of a material ﬂow system
and has to perform a variety of control and optimization tasks. An indispens-
able element is a separate control on the level of a material ﬂow control for
the control of type-independent functions.
In order-picking the system has to communicate cyclically with the su-
perordinate control system to transmit the sorting criteria which change with
each sorting batch. With this method the completeness of the sorting job as
well as the stop criteria (e.g., because of missing goods and shortages (no-
read) or faulty picks (no-need)) are checked. Finished and executed jobs have
to be documented for the sake of a better transparency.
The eﬃcient operation of a sorter is no trivial task. A variety of diﬀerent
control and process strategies are involved here, starting with the building of
the order-picking batches over the stop and go of a batch, the prioritization
of a destination assignment up to the control of the packaging system. Basic

interdependencies are described in [64]. A careful planning, e.g., with the help
of a computer-aided simulation of the overall system, is indispensable.
4.4 Robots in warehouse systems
Robots are handling devices which can inﬂuence the orientation of a good in
a room in addition to its situation. They have at least three axles and are
used in warehouse systems for palletizing and order-picking.
4.4.1 Palletizing robots
Palletizing robots are, one the one hand, used to relieve man from monotonous
and physically strenuous work which require intricate auxiliary means and
thus long processing times. Compared to fully automated special facilities
they are more ﬂexible and cost-eﬃcient for the handling of small work loads.
Typical robots for these tasks are portal or articulated arm robots.
4.4.2 Order-picking robots
Robots are used in order-picking which are mounted on rack feeders and
pick the goods from the shelf. Others operate in separate areas where they
pick larger standardized units from pallet stacks. The technical expenditure
and the performance depend considerably on the provision of pick-up units.
The more precise this provision the easier can the robot be integrated into
the overall system. These systems put large requirements on the positioning,
decollation and handling of articles and thus demand time-consuming and
costly processes.

5. Automation of the Material Flow
Automation comprises the independent operation of a technical system in
line with high performance and economy.
With regard to computer-aided and thus mostly stand-alone functions,
warehouse management is also a part of automation, however on a superior
business management level (cf. Chapter 2 and 7). Here, above all the strate-
gic and anticipated warehouse and distribution functions are automated. The
automation of the material ﬂow aims at controlling and supervising the op-
erative handling of the material ﬂow.
This chapter describes the basics of the material ﬂow automation. Based
on a hierarchical classiﬁcation, we present ﬁrst the main terms, requirements
and tasks. The main elements of an automation technology are the control,
sensors and drives to record and inﬂuence the material ﬂow processes. The
basic structure and functioning of the devices is described in the example of
a typical application.
5.1 Basics of automation
Technological and economical aspects aﬀect the technical design and oper-
ation of material ﬂow systems and in many cases oﬀer a possibility for au-
tomation. Although these requirements diﬀer from case to case the goals are
identical:
– Improved system performance (transshipment rate, shorter order lead
times)
– Quality assurance (continuous quality of the products and processes, ob-
servance of deadlines)
– Cost savings
– Relief of personnel from uniform, strenuous activities
Whether or not these requirements are met mainly depends on the choice,
dimensioning and arrangement of the function areas in the warehouse as well
as the used conveyors and storage facilities (cf. Chapter 4). The main task
of the automation technology is to ensure the smooth functioning of the
single conveyors and storage facilities or their components and to coordinate
interlinked systems.

138
5. Automation of the Material Flow
Automation does not always make sense since manual solutions may be
more simple or economical. An alternative to the in-house transport of pal-
lets, for example, are the manual transport with a hand pallet truck, a
semi-automated transport by stacker or the fully automated transport on
driven conveyor belts and automated guided transport systems. Which solu-
tion should be preferred depends on the frame conditions set by the overall
system and is not studied in detail here.
5.1.1 History of the material ﬂow automation
Modern automation technology was largely aﬀected by inventions in the ﬁeld
of electrical engineering and electronics some of which are listed below (cf.
Table 5.1).

Mobile electronic data memories are introduced in industry.
since 1990
Personal computers are more and more used in warehouse man-
agement for management and control.
Obviously, computer-aided data processing has had a considerable inﬂu-
ence on the development of the modern automation technology, above all the
development of microprocessors and the introduction of standardized com-
puter architectures [24]. Almost all digital controls which are currently used
in material ﬂow technology are based on these principles.
Advanced processors and memories in line with an increasing integration
of electronic components set the basis for systems the size of a check card and
the performance of a common PC. In addition to central process computers,
more and more mobile PC and handheld devices are being used. These are
described in more detail in section 5.2.3.

5.1 Basics of automation

5.1.2 Terms and deﬁnitions
According to the standard DIN 19233 automation is the independent perfor-
mance of processes by means of suitable technical means [18]. Based on this
process term the functioning of an automated system (cf. Fig. 5.1) shall be
described in general.
A process is an activity within a system where material, energy or infor-
mation is reformed, transported or stored.
Principally, the automation of a process requires target values which de-
termine the desired procedure. This information can either be stored in the
system or set by an operator independent of the situation.
The process and the respective functions of an automat often depend on
the process status. For this reason, relevant information about the process
status have to be recorded with sensors and evaluated in the form of signals.

Figure 5.1. Active principle of an automaton
The input signals (state variables) are processed in a control according
to deﬁned rules (in a program) and at the end of the control returned to the
process. Actuators then change these output signals (control variables) into
process-speciﬁc parameters so that the process is inﬂuenced as desired. This
is characteristic for all automated systems and can also be used for subordi-
nate sub-processes.
One elementary material ﬂow process is the translocation, i.e., the trans-
port of goods. For example, containers provided in an order-picking area are
ﬁlled with goods according to the order and then placed on a conveyor belt.
This container is transported via switches, connections and dischargers either
into an automatic container warehouse or onto a sorter which discharges the
containers onto diﬀerent lines in front of the goods receipt.

140
5. Automation of the Material Flow
In a warehouse management system the transport of the container is con-
sidered as the superordinate process with the aim to discharge the container
or to move it to a bin in the container warehouse. Sub-processes are the
movement of a switch, a pusher or a rack feeder. The task of the control
is to activate these components, i.e., to initiate the subordinate movement
processes.
There are two diﬀerent automation methods which describe the function-
ing of such systems [17]:
Open loop control implies an open function where incoming target
variables are inserted into the control line, i.e., into the control and
the process. The control processes these target variables according to
a stored logic and generated control variables for the process to be
controlled. Disturbance variables which may aﬀect the process can
sometimes not be identiﬁed.
Closed loop control describes a closed function where the status vari-
ables of a process are inserted directly at the beginning of the control
and compared with the target variables to minimize, for example,
disturbance variables.
In automated systems there is not always a clear diﬀerence between con-
trol and closed loop control since sensors always give a feedback to the control
about the process status so that disturbances can be eliminated, if necessary.
A regulation in the narrower sense occurs in systems where processes are
recorded continuously, for example the warehouse regulation at the axle drives
of a robot (cf. section 5.4). To ensure the exact positioning of the unsteady
axle load also under changing conditions while the robot follows the curves
it is necessary to continuously check the axle positions and to compare them
with the dynamical parameters (accelerations).
On the other hand, the automation of material ﬂow processes with discrete
piece good ﬂows is discontinuous and the moved units are recorded only
at predetermined points along the material ﬂow. For this reason, the term
material ﬂow control is used as a synonym for material ﬂow automation.
5.1.3 The structure of control systems
The technical design and structure of a material ﬂow control is mainly de-
termined by the type and number of the processes and sub-processes to be
automated. It may either be centralized or decentralized.
In case of a centralized control system all control functions are performed
by one control and all sensors and actuators of the operating means are di-
rectly connected to this control (e.g., process computer or SPS). Of advantage
is the direct access to the overall system and the possibility to change the

5.1 Basics of automation
141
control process from a central point. When the control breaks down, however,
the complete material ﬂow system stops. In decentralized control systems the
control functions are performed by diﬀerent components with a limited scope
which control a section of the material ﬂow. These components exchange the
control and process information of the diﬀerent sections via communication
systems.
A combination of both systems are distributed control systems where the
decentralized components are coordinated by a superordinate system. Infor-
mation is exchanged centrally via the superordinate system what requires
additional communication.
In practice, distributed control systems with standardized communica-
tion networks and component interfaces prevail. An advantage compared to
centralized control systems is the higher availability and investment security
because owing to its modularity it has an open structure and is suitable for
multi-client operation. When all single functions of the automated warehouse
sections are controlled by one system, this may lead to complex overall sys-
tems. It has also to be considered that components and devices of diﬀerent
manufacturers often have to be combined into a functioning system. The
possible variants and resulting requirements are legion. In order to design
technically and economically suitable material ﬂow controls which meet the
requirements with regard to
– planning and projection,
– realization and implementation, and
– operation and maintenance,
it is necessary to structure the main requirements.
For this purpose the control functions must ﬁrst be divided into process-
related single controls, section controls and superordinate master controls.
This inevitably results in hierarchical control levels with clearly deﬁned tasks.
The possible hierarchies of automation systems are discussed in literature
under diﬀerent technical and organizational aspects [94, 39]. Logistic systems
can be divided into the following levels according to the EDP systems or the
ﬁelds of application:
– Company management level →Management of the company-wide lo-
gistics by production planning and control or enterprise resource planning
– Factory management level →Factory-wide coordination of all work
ﬁelds, management of the operation of subordinate sections, levels of the
warehouse management
– Control level →Division-wide control of facilities and work ﬁelds such
as rack feeders, conveyors
– Field level →Recording and manipulation of processes
– Material ﬂow level →Physical processes controlled by the superordinate
level

142
5. Automation of the Material Flow
A detailed hierarchical model was described by the transport forum of the
German association VDMA1 in its journal [94]. It determines the functions
of the levels and interfaces to facilitate the planning and implementation of
material ﬂow systems and to coordinate the single manufacturers.
The hierarchical model shown in Fig. 5.2 consists of the master level, which
is responsible for the order recording and dispatch as well as the inventory
management and six other levels further down. This model represents the
functions of material ﬂow controls, but no ﬁxed speciﬁcations since diﬀerent
levels can be combined depending on their complexity. Information are ex-
changed between the diﬀerent levels from the dispatching WMS up to the
performing elements on the ﬁeld level.
Level 6: presentation and communication
This level represents the interface to the warehouse management. It receives
transport requests transmitted by the WMS and sends them to the subor-
dinate system control together with the system coordinates. It also sends
feedbacks to order completion or error messages to the WMS. It is, further-
more, responsible for the operation of the plant, the visualization of the plant
status and the logging of the processes. The most commonly used term for
the computer systems used on this level is material ﬂow control (MFC). Gen-
erally one or several interlinked industrial PC are used depending on the size
of the plant.
Level 5: System control
On this level all transport processes within the material ﬂow are controlled
centrally. The warehouse management dispatches the transport requests as
orders. Therefore, this level usually includes a model of the material ﬂow
system with all topological data, backlogs of orders and status information.
It also includes transport strategies as basis for the optimized control (cf.
Chapter 3) of transport orders in the system according to the plant status.
This system control assigns the transport orders to the suitable conveyors
and transfers them to the control of the respective subsystem.
Level 4: Subsystem control
The units on this level decentrally control all operations of the closed sub-
systems of a plant such as a high-bay warehouse or an automated guided
transport system. Subsystem controls are also called subordinate controls
and implemented in the form of an industrial PC or programmable controls
(cf. section 5.2.2) of the upper class. For implementation and maintenance
single sections can be semi-automated.

Level 3: Section control
A subsystem control may be divided into diﬀerent functional sections where
independent section controls regulate the operation of the conveyors. These
may be an automated guided transport vehicle or the section of a conveyor

144
5. Automation of the Material Flow
line. On this level the occupancy of the conveyors is managed, for example, by
recording the containers on a conveyor belt which are identiﬁed by a scanner.
Level 2: Element control
The element controls control one or several drives of a conveyor element. They
are either part of a section control or micro-controllers. This level is respon-
sible for the safety mechanisms and the synchronization with neighbouring
element controls.
Level 1: Drives and transmitters
Transmitters (sensors, cf. section 5.3) and drives (actuators) (cf. section 5.4)
build the interfaces between the material ﬂow control and the material ﬂow
level. Sensors transmit measuring values about the system status and the
relevant processes to the control of the next superordinate level. The drives
provide the mechanical energy for the transport movement.
In addition to the functional design, the planning (cf. Chapter 8) of a material
ﬂow control has also to consider and specify the interfaces between the levels
or controls.
Above all the scope and time schedule of the information exchange be-
tween the control levels have to be determined. The requirements and the
adequate communication means are studied in detail in section 5.5.
5.2 Control engineering
This section describes the basic functioning and structure of the control de-
vices used in automation systems. Characteristic for these control devices
are the presentation and processing of information as well as the program
realization, i.e., the generation of necessary functions and active principles.
We want to point out that in addition to electrical or electronic controls
also pneumatic or hydraulic controls are used for certain ﬁeld-related control
tasks which usually require just a few switches. But the technology of these
devices is not described in detail in this book.
5.2.1 Classiﬁcation of controls
To get an overview over, the multitude of diﬀerent controls and the basic
features which have to be considered during the project planning and choice
are described below.
Presentation of information
Process signals which are recorded by sensors or transmitted to actuators
and processed by a control are analogous, binary or digital.

5.2 Control engineering
145
Analogous signals are continuous in time. They are used, for example, for
temperature measurements where the measured temperature is represented
as a corresponding analogous voltage in a given voltage range, e.g., 0V up to
10V. Binary signals, on the other hand, can only represent two conditions (0
or 1), e.g., the supply of voltage. The information contents of a binary signal
thus is one bit. Digital signals are built by a series of bits which represent a
discrete value.
While in the past control information were represented by these diﬀerent
signals, e.g., in analogous computers, today only digital controls based on
micro-processors are used. For this purpose, A/D-converters2 are used which
transform a recorded analogous voltage into time and value discrete digital
values.
Types of functions
According to the German standard DIN 19237, the impact of functional and
time-related aspects is characterized by two elementary types of controls:
In case of a logic control combinations of input signals are logically con-
nected and represented without delay on the corresponding values of the
output signals according to a if-then rule. A typical example for a logic con-
trol are, for example, safety circuits in plants. The drive of a conveyor can
only be actuated when all emergency halts are released and no limit switch is
activated. For this reason, the type of control is also called interlock control.
Logic controls can easily be modelled mathematically by means of the
Boolean algebra as a combination of the elementary functions AND, OR,
and NOT (cf. Fig. 5.3), which are also called logical operations.
OR                             AND                      NEGATION
Figure 5.3. Elementary logical relation (cf. [22])
In the simplest case the control is modelled in the form of a truth-table
where all valid combinations of input conditions and the corresponding out-
2 Short for analogous/digital converter

146
5. Automation of the Material Flow
put signal images are listed. This results in an equation system which can be
combined and reduced to an elementary logical equation and a combinato-
rial circuit. Extensive logic controls are modelled with automatic procedures
which are described in more detail in [24].
The ﬂow control describes the forced successive run of a program and thus
of the process to be controlled. It consists of process and time-related steps.
One example is the control of a pallet lift in a conveyor system. For the
system control subordinate to the WMS (cf. section 5.1.3), the process con-
sists of one single step, the movement between two levels under consideration
of the source and target coordinates in the plant. In the control of the sub-
system the process is staged:
The pallet waits in front of the lift →Stopping and starting of the
lift →Pallet is moved in →Lifting of the lift to the respective level
and stop →Pallet is removed.
In this case, the control is divided into a logical sequence of single steps so
that it is also called sequential chain or sequential logic system. The succeed-
ing steps can start only when the preceding steps have been completed and
all relaying requirements are met. Other than in combinatorial circuits in se-
quential logic systems the control process is either generated event-controlled
by external relaying conditions or by a pulse generator. Suitable control ele-
ments for this purpose are:
– Latches (ﬂip-ﬂops)
– Timing elements
– Counters (shift registers)
Latches have to be able to store two signal stati (logical “0” or “1”) and
thus are bi-stable elements. A basic form of this kind of memory is the so-
called RS ﬂip-ﬂop which has two inputs and two outputs (cf. Fig. 5.4).

Figure 5.4. Structure of an RS ﬂip-ﬂop

5.2 Control engineering
147
Flip-ﬂops consist of two elementary logic operations, in this case NOR
gates3. The RS ﬂip-ﬂop diﬀerentiates three possible conditions according to
the truth-table:
Setting: At “1”-level and S-input the output Q is set at “1”-level.
Storage: If the S-input then again has a “0”-level the output Q remains
unchanged.
Resetting: If the R-input is connected with “1”-level the output Q is set to
“0”-level.
If both inputs have a “0”-level the condition of the ﬂip-ﬂop is undeter-
mined.
Programming of controls
In practice controls use a combination of both functions. Thus, the interlocks
within a sequential chain often are a combination of stored system conditions
and process-speciﬁc signals.
The required logical and process-related functions are called a program.
According to the German standard DIN 44300, a program is an instruction
required for the performance of a task with all necessary agreements. But the
use of programs does not necessarily result in a software solution. The term
can also be used for discrete, i.e., hardware-based controls.
Wired program systems (WPS) are wired or ﬁxed programmed controls
for deﬁned automation tasks which usually cannot be changed or adapted
afterwards or only at great expense. For this reason these controls are mainly
used in small systems with only few inputs and outputs and safety func-
tions (emergency stop, limit switch). They consist, for example, of relays and
contactors and can thus only be used for the processing of binary signals.
Programmable logic controllers (PLC) contain the control functions in the
form of program codes which are either freely programmable (software) or
programmable with interchangeable memory (ﬁrmware, EPROM modules4
so that they can easily be changed later on. In addition to the automation
devices of the same name, the group of PLCs also includes controls based on
industrial PC and micro-controllers.
This term is not only in its original sense for the group of controls but also
for automation devices since these are widely used. PLCs are mainly used on
the lower and medium control levels.
5.2.2 Programmable logic controllers
In order to avoid confusion, in this section the term PLC is used as synonym
for the automation device. The standard DIN EN 61131 (IEC 1131) deﬁnes
a programmable logic controller as [37]:
3 They may also consist of NAND gates; in this case the signal level inverted at
the input and outputs has to be considered
4 Erasable and programmable read only memory, e.g., erasable by UV light.

148
5. Automation of the Material Flow
“A digitally operating, electronic system to be used in industrial
environments with a programmable memory for the internal storage
of user-speciﬁc control instructions for the implementation of speciﬁc
functions such as the logic control, ﬂow control, time, counting and
arithmetic functions, in order to control diﬀerent kinds of machines
and processes by means of digital or analogous input and output
signals.”
PCLs have been the long-used core of industrial automation systems be-
cause of their reliability and robustness. Owing to their modular structure
and large variety of possible conﬁgurations, PLCs can be used for various
applications. Furthermore, they are inexpensive and easy to operate.
PLCs are mainly used to automate ﬂow-controlled processes thus the
name automation device. Modern programmable logic controllers are ad-
vanced logic controls which originally were designed as connector controls.
In 1968 a group of engineers at General Motors developed the ﬁrst PLC;
since 1979 the controllers of the Siemens series SIMATIC S5, and of the suc-
ceeding series S7, have been used as a worldwide standard in many industrial
areas.
System structure
The basic PLC consists of the following function groups:
Power supply: Provides the power for the device and protects it against
power surges.
Communication: Acts as user interface and allows the operator and the pro-
grammer to program and maintain the PCL.
Interfaces: The PLC is connected with the plant section to be controlled or
the processes and the superordinate systems via input/output elements
and interface processes. At these interfaces sensor values are read, actu-
ators are activated and process conditions are transmitted to the master
computer or managing tasks are accepted.
Signal processing: The core of a PLC is the signal processing in the CPU5
where the input signals are processed, the logic control connections are
computed in a determinable time, i.e., realtime and transmitted to the
output components.
Storage: Flow control functions are directly connected to the storage func-
tions where communication and interface data are evaluated and new
values are computed.
Structure
As already said, a PLC is a modular system allowing for the easy exchange
of certain modules or the integrated functions. Generally, all modules are

The processor assembly consists of one or several processors, internal reg-
isters (ﬂags) and a memory for the program and the so-called process image.
In addition, it also serves as connector for external devices such as program-
ming, operating and output devices.
In the input assemblies binary signals are processed by generators for
further processing. Each input is electrically isolated from the internal system
by an opto-connector and equipped with a delay module for a secure signal
recognition and to avoid false releases because of “shattering” buttons or
switches.
Output assemblies emit the binary signals computed by the central unit.
Here as well, each output is electrically isolated from the system by an opto-
connector. Circuit-breaker switches are mostly integrated and higher voltages
can be achieved by coupled relays or power switches (Thryristors, Triacs,
etc.).
Special assemblies include analogous input/output modules. Here, incom-
ing analog values are converted by A/D converters for the internal digital pro-
cessing. On the other hand, digital values by converted by D/A converters
into the required analog voltage.

150
5. Automation of the Material Flow
Further assemblies are counter modules for quick events, display modules,
computer coupling modules, diagnose modules as well as bus couplers for
diﬀerent ﬁeld bus systems.
Functionality and programming
All programmable logic controllers operate cyclically with stored programs.
At the beginning of a cycle a process image is generated from the input signals
and stored in the PLC memory. This image is processed by the program
and transmitted to the outputs. The process image is updated once before
each program cycle and remains unchanged throughout the run to avoid
inconsistencies due to changed input signals.
This method is very fast but may lead to diﬀerent runtimes per cycle since
the software may also include branches. The PLC software can be divided
into diﬀerent components with three hierarchical levels according to standard
IEC 1131-3:
– PROG: The main program of the PLC. Here, the periphery and the mem-
ory (global variables) are managed.
– FB: Function blocks access input and output variables and manage the
tags (memory elements).
– FUN: Functions (also calls sub-components SC) are sub-programs and also
control the input and output variables but with a memory function.
A component can only be accessed hierarchically from the superordinate
component.
The programs are generated with the text and graphic tools of the PLC
providers which are listed in the standards DIN EN 61131 or IEC 1131, part
3 [37]:
The instruction set (IS) resembles the internal computer-code of the PLC
the most. The program is a list of single instructions (cf. Fig. 5.6) which are
executed in the given order during the program run. An instruction consists
of the logic operation and the respective operator. Owing to the machine-
oriented programming with IS, a high processing speed can be achieved;
however, in case of extensive control tasks the program-code may become
very complex.
The programmer may ﬁnd it much easier to program the control in the
form of a structured text (ST) which allows for abstracted and intuitively
understandable commands. But at ﬁrst the source text has to be converted
by a compiler (cf. Chapter 7). As a result the machine-code is relatively un-
aﬀected, which may lead to a less eﬃcient runtime. An advantage, however,
is the compact and clear formulation which can also be used for more com-
plex tasks. Furthermore, the standard IEC 1131 also provides for the use of
compilers and thus for the programming in high-level languages such as C.

In addition for text entries also graphical entries can be used for pro-
gramming purposes. The ladder diagram represents all functions in the form
of circuit symbols similar to the presentation in circuit diagrams. The relay
wiring was adapted from electronic engineering so that a program can be rep-
resented like a circuit diagram (cf. Fig. 5.7). The symbols open contact and
closed contact are used to mark the consumers (such as drives, displays).

The continuous function chart (CFC) or the function block language
(FBL) can be used to process integers or ﬂoating point values. The circuit
symbols used in the ladder diagram have been replaced by logic symbols of
the Boolean algebra.
The ﬂow language (FL) can either be used in graphic as well as textual
form and is even more complex than the languages described earlier. It can
be used to divide a complex program into simple blocks or units and thus to
get a clearer structure.

5. Automation of the Material Flow
5.2.3 Computer control
The term process computer includes all types of microprocessor-based systems
which are used in automation for the control and process management. In
this context the PLC (cf. section 5.2.2) is a kind of process computer. There
is quite a variety of other computer systems which are used in diﬀerent partly
very special control areas.
Process computers generally are all kinds of programmable digital com-
puter which oﬀer the following functions::
– Realtime6 data recording, processing and output
– Input and output of process signals in the form of electrical signals
– Single bit processing
The architecture of process computers is similar and consists of one or
several processors, memory modules, data and address bus as well as I/O
modules to couple the periphery. The diﬀerent designs are classiﬁed into
– Single-chip computers (micro-controller, embedded systems)
– Single-board micro-computers
– Industrial PCs, plug-in computers
Single-chip computers are integrated micro-controllers that include all
components (processor core, program and working memory, I/O modules as
well as A/D converter, counting and timing relays) in one chip case which
is equipped with connections for the power supply, signal lines and, if nec-
essary, a serial interface to the in-Circuit programming. Because of its size
the capacity of the program and working memory is limited to one kilobytes
up to some 100 kilobytes. Since micro-controllers usually have a small in-
struction repertoire, such chips are mainly programmed in assembler code
(cf. Chapter 7) or by means of speciﬁc high-level language compilers. Since
the control functionality is in any case processor-speciﬁc the programmer has
to ﬁnd a suitable program for time-critical processes which are determined
by the cycle time of the process commands to be executed. Micro-controllers
are used, for example, for machine-oriented control functions in sensors or
actuators or as communication module in ﬁeld bus controls.
Single-board computers are based on a micro-controller as well as dis-
cretely on single integrated circuits. In addition to actual computer com-
ponents the board7 holds the signal periphery for the level adjustment and
interfaces for the connection as plug-in computer or screwed contacts for a
free wiring.
6 German standard DIN 44300 deﬁnes realtime capability as the “operation of a
computer system with continuously available programs for the processing of data
so that the results are available within a given period of time.”

Industrial PC are similar to conventional personal computers; however,
the casing and components are designed to meet the special requirements
of the operational environment and availability. The signal periphery is con-
nected with the PC by plug-in cards which allow for interface connections
similar to a PLC.
Industrial PCs are used for the simple dispatching in order management
and process supervision in subordinate controls up to the direct control of
processes by means of sensors and actuators. While the ﬁrst two application
do not need deterministic process response times of a few milliseconds and
thus put no requirements on the time behaviour of the installed operating sys-
tem a realtime capable operating system is indispensable in process-oriented
controls (cf. Chapter 7).
5.3 Sensors
To be able to inﬂuence an automatic system and its processes it is necessary
to understand the relevant system states. The status of a system is described
by a number of physical parameter which have to be identiﬁed by sensors
and changed into a suitable (electrical) output value which can be processed
by the control.
5.3.1 Sensor classiﬁcations
Sensors are classiﬁed according to diﬀerent characteristics like the physical
measuring volume, the measuring principle or the representation of measured
values at the sensor output. This classiﬁcation is also used as basis for the
choice of a device for an automation system.

154
5. Automation of the Material Flow
The tasks of a sensor are deﬁned by the physical measurements to be
recorded. In this context, the dimension represents the scanning range of
the sensor or the presentation of the measured values. The classiﬁcation into
tactile and non-tactile sensors shows which kind of measuring device has
direct mechanical contact with the process and thus is prone to wear and
tear. In the following, the typical types of material ﬂow sensors are described,
classiﬁed according to the physical measuring principle under consideration
of technical designs and interfaces.
5.3.2 Mechanically operated sensors
Switches and push-buttons are often used to supply low voltages. This sen-
sor group is characterized by a simple and maintenance-free structure and
is used for many industrial applications. An external force activates an elec-
trical contact in the sensor which turns on the power supply at the sensor
connection.
Mechanical sensors designed as break contacts, open contacts or toggle
switches supervise these functions so that cable breaks or sensor breakdowns
can be detected by a potential drop in the signal chain. Due to their con-
struction and the tactile operation switches and push-buttons are prone to
mechanical wear and tear but achieve a relatively high frequency (about
500,000 - 107 switching cycles).
The contacts generally allow only for small voltages up to some 100W.
Typical is a connection at the input module of a PLC. Here, an auxiliary
supply provided by the control and connected by the sensor is evaluated by
the PLC as a binary signal.
Push-buttons and switches are used to detect the ﬁnal positions of linear
drives or load take-ups at rack feeders (limit switch) as well as as safety
element on vehicle bumpers. Furthermore, they are part of control panels
and safety circuits (emergency stop).
5.3.3 Optical sensors
Optical sensors are widely used in material ﬂow systems for measuring tasks.
Their range of application reaches from a simple sensor for attendance checks
(light barrier) up to the automatic check of the position and environment
conditions of autonomous vehicles.
Optical sensors have a somewhat similar structure and consist of a light
source (sender) and an optical detector (receiver) which converts the intensity
of a light beam which is reﬂected or broken by an object into an electrical
signal. Speciﬁcal diﬀerences are the arrangement of the optical path and the
evaluation in the receiver.
Because of their measuring principle optical sensors work contact-free
and thus free of wear. In practice, problems may occur due to soiling and
condensation at the optical parts as well as external light.

Figure 5.8. Optical recording with light barriers and scanners
Attendance check
For the automatic recording and counting light barriers and light switches
are used (cf. Fig. 5.8) which generate a binary output signal. The sender con-
sists of a light source (LED, visible and IR light) and a focussing lens, which
bundles the beam. The receiver includes a light-sensitive element (photo-
transistor) and is connected to a sensor, which switches when the intensity of
an incoming light beam exceeds or falls below an adjustable threshold value.
This threshold value can usually be set by a potentiometer to adjust the ar-
rangement of the application environment.
One-way light barrier: Here, the sender and the receiver are separated and
mounted, for example, at opposite sides of a conveyor belt to record and
count passing objects. For this reason, one-way light barriers are also
called through-beam switches.
When the light beam is disconnected a switching operation is started in
the receiver. The distance between the sender (S) and the receiver (R)
can be set at random, but it has to be ensured that the optical beam is
exactly adjusted. Because they work over large distances one-way light
barriers are also used to secure gateways and entries to machines. Here,
the sender as well as the receiver have to be supplied with an auxiliary
voltage.
Light scanners: In these devices the sender and the receiver are mounted in a
casing. To start a switching operation, the light beam has to be reﬂected
by a passing object and guided to the receiver. When the beam hits the
receiver, the switching operation is started. To avoid faulty switches by
reﬂected external light infrared diodes and transistors as well as ﬁlters
are used.

156
5. Automation of the Material Flow
The function of the light scanner depends on the reﬂecting characteristics
of the objects to be scanned. The light has to be reﬂected oﬀan object
surface so that the intensity of the beam in the receiver is high enough
also when the object is tilted. Highly light-absorbing or reﬂecting and
very smooth surfaces (foils) may limit the usable scan (scanning range)
considerably or even make a measuring impossible.
The scanning range of light scanners is usually limited to a distance of
≤2m.
Reﬂecting light barriers: These are structured like light scanners but the light
beam is not reﬂected by an object but by a reﬂector on the opposite side,
which permanently returns the beam to the receiver. When the beam
is disconnected a switching operation is started. The principle is similar
to that of a one-way light barrier. As with light scanners, the reﬂecting
surfaces of passing objects are problematic but for another reason: The
beam path — and thus the object detection — may be impeded by
reﬂections at the object.
Light grids: Single light barriers are arranged in lines in cascades. The sensors
of this system bundle the single binary output signals into one digital
signal. Light grids are used to control the height of packages and pallets
and to secure the warehouse aisles.
Path and angle measuring
The through-beam or reﬂection principle is used in a modiﬁed form to deter-
mine the position of the axles of conveyors and drives.
The positioning requires an optical scale on a driving axle or on the path
which can be scanned by the sensor either incrementally or absolutely.
In case of an incremental scan a single sensor element (light barrier or scan-
ner) scans a path of alternately reﬂecting and light-absorbing ﬁelds (reﬂected
light method) on the scale or ﬁelds with gaps (through-beam method) of the
same width. The relative path or angle and, based on the measuring time,
also the speed can be determined by counting the phase changes at a ﬁxed
reference point.
It has to be ensured that in incremental systems the movement of the
drive is always recorded by a reference tag so that in case of a blackout the
information will not be lost.
Absolute scales can have one or several tracks. In contrast to incremental
systems the absolutely coded measuring systems have to be referenced just
once since a clear binary coded position value referring to a virtual zero point
can be read at any point on the scale.
Single-track scales have light-dark ﬁelds or gaps of diﬀerent widths ar-
ranged in the measuring direction. The ﬁelds represent a non-iterative se-
quential code [69], which is scanned by a sensor line consisting of sidewise

Figure 5.9. Optical absolute coded path measuring system
arranged light barriers and transmitted at the sensor output in the form of
a digital value.
The measuring system is used by a telpher line or rack feeders as posi-
tioning scale, for example with a steel rail mounted at the driving path (cf.
Abb. 5.9) The signal processor integrated in the sensor head continuously
determines the absolute position of the sensor according to the scanned bit
pattern and transmits the resulting value via the integrated serial interface.
The resolution is less than 1 mm at a maximum measuring distance of several
hundred meters.
In multi-track systems each track of a bit corresponds to a code consisting
of n tracks spaced one above the other and thus builds 2n discrete clear
position variables. This principle is used in absolute coded angle transmitters
which are ﬂanged to the axle of the positioning drive and detect the position
of the motor shaft. The position variables are also transmitted serially.
Measurement of lengths
Transit time techniques are used for the optical measurement of lengths.
With this method, the time between the generation of a light beam in the
sender and the reception is measured. Sender and receiver are mounted in
a casing and together with the measurement processor they form the sen-
sor which determines the distance to the objects. For physical reasons this
method requires a coherent, i.e., unbroken laser beam generated by a laser
diode. Industrial sensors achieve a measuring accuracy of some millimeters
and modern high-resolution systems even in the range of micro-meters.
These systems are used alternatively to scale systems in high-bay ware-
houses for the positioning of rack feeders. In these cases, the sensor is mounted
on the carriage of the rack feeder and directed at a ﬁxed reﬂector at the end
of the aisle. Because of this arrangement the laser distance measuring devices
are limited to straight moving facilities.
Laser scanners are also based on this measuring principle, but the laser
beam is additionally reﬂected fan-shaped by a rotating tilted mirror above
the casing and generates a planar scan ﬁeld (cf. Fig. 5.10). The sensor scans
the environment in preset steps and at each cycle generates a set of single
measuring values corresponding to the distances in the polar coordinates.
With a local resolution of 0◦- 1◦and an average environmental distance of
10 m objects with a minimum width of 10 cm can still be detected.

Figure 5.10. Laser scanner for the identiﬁcation of objects and supervision of the

These devices — when stationary — can be used to supervise the machine
safety areas by conﬁguring a warning area which overlays the device inter-
faces. When objects enter the warning ﬁeld and thus the actual distance falls
below the ﬁxed warning distance a signal output is activated at the device
which may be connected, for example, with a warning device or an emergency
stop at the machine control. Furthermore, this kind of laser scanner is also
used on automatic guided transport systems for a continuous environment
scan. In combination with a computer the scan ﬁeld generated by the sensor
sets the basis for the vehicle navigation.
During one kind of vehicle navigation the environment ﬁxed coded re-
ﬂector tags are scanned. A laser sensor mounted on the vehicle or trolley,
which is also equipped with rotating mirrors, scans the environment within
a range of 360◦. The navigation requires only some absolutely scanned mea-
suring points. Based on the topology data stored in the sensor, the horizontal
sensor coordinates and, thus, the vehicle coordinates can be determined.
5.3.4 Magnetic and inductive sensors
Magnetic and inductive sensors are used in material ﬂow technology for the
contact-free attendance and warehouse control of moving objects and for
positioning. Both measuring principles are based on the detection of changes
in the magnetic ﬁeld within the direct scan range of a sensor.
Based on a spindle module, inductive sensors actively generate an alter-
nating magnetic ﬁeld which acts on a receiving coil, which is also integrated
in the sensor casing. The voltage induced by this ﬁeld is ampliﬁed in a down-
stream measuring bridge and directed by an evaluation unit to the sensor
outlet.

5.3 Sensors

Scale
Scan window
Figure 5.11. Magnetic positioning with an absolute coded scale)
Metallic objects which enter into the scanning range of the sensor change
the ﬁeld (damping) and thus the voltage, which can be detected at the sensor
interface as an analog or binary signal.
Inductive proximity switches convert the analog voltage at the measuring
bridge into a binary output signal with an adjustable switching threshold.
The switching frequency can thus be varied within strict limits. The typical
scanning range of proximity switches is just a few millimeter.
The group of magnetic sensors includes magneto-resistive sensors (MR)
and Hall sensors. Both principles are passive, i.e., an external magnetic ﬁeld
is either directly converted into an analog output voltage (Hall principle) or
initiates a change of the resistance (MR), which is evaluated in a measuring
bridge.
Magnetic sensors are binary transmitters and used in the same way as
inductive proximity switches. Objects are detected by means of permanent
magnets.
Magnetic positioning systems consist of sensors arranged in a line which
scan the magnetic scale at the driving course [34]. The scanning method and
the possible resolution are similar to that of optical systems. In this case, the
incremental or absolute coded tracks are built by magnetic pole ﬁelds on the
ferromagnetic base of the scale (cf Fig. 5.11).
5.3.5 Ultrasonic sensors
Ultrasonic sensors are used for the measuring of distances and work according
to the runtime measuring principle. The ultrasonic sender in the sensor emits
sound waves in a frequency range above the human hearing range (40 up to
some 100 kHz) which are reﬂected by the environment and returned to the
receiver.

160
5. Automation of the Material Flow
The measurements are pulsed; the sender generates a sound impulse of
a ﬁxed length during each measurement. A downstream controller measures
the runtime diﬀerence between the generation and the return of the sound
wave and stores the measured value in a register. Parameter data can be
transmitted, measurements can be initiated and the last measured value can
be read via a digital interface. Measured data are put out as time or stan-
dardized distance value, according to the parametrization, the read digital
value corresponds, for example, to a linear measure in millimeters or inches.
Since the values are transmitted by ultrasonic waves the practical average
range of a sensor is about 5 m, the measuring accuracy some centimeters.
The eﬀects of temperature and humidity on the acoustic velocity of the air
have also to be taken into consideration.
Sender and receiver are both mounted in one casing, which may be
equipped with a megaphone for the directed sound radiation. It has to be
considered that the radiation of the sender is not linearly directed due to
overlays and reﬂections at the megaphone. This leads to additional externally
eﬀective secondary areas in addition to the primary club-like measuring ar-
eas. This may result in unclear measured values if the sound wave is reﬂected
by several objects at diﬀerent places in the measuring area.
Ultrasonic sensors are an inexpensive device for environment scans and
can be used as anti-collision devices at automatic guided transport vehicles
and mobile robots.
5.4 Actuators
Actuator8 are driving elements which convert the control signals into move-
ments. Actuators, thus, are a link between the information processing on the
control level and the automatic material ﬂow processes.
The driving tasks in a warehouse or distribution system reach from the
simple movement of a conveyor belt or roller conveyor up to the complex
multi-axle movements of a robot. As manifold are the requirements on the
actuators (cf. Chapter 4).
The characteristics and speciﬁc control features of the actuators are de-
scribed according to the driving tasks typical in warehouse and distribution
systems.
5.4.1 The tasks and structures of actuator systems
There are diﬀerent kinds of drives [95] depending on the movements of an
actuator or its task:
8 Generally, actuators can be deﬁned as technical systems which convert an electri-
cal input value into an adequate physical output value by means of an emergency
current.

Moving drives are used in most conveying and warehouse work machines,
e.g., in cranes, lifts, conveyors and vehicles. They are operated continuously
over longer periods of time and described by revolution and torque, force and
speed, respectively.
Actuating drives make discontinuous movements to ﬁxed control positions.
Such actuators usually approach deﬁned control positions which are deter-
mined mechanically or by sensors or by target values speciﬁed in the control.
Servo drives are used, for example, in discharging modules of sorters,in lifting
devices or pallet shifters.
Positioning drives are used as motion drives, for example, in rack feeders or
monorail suspension tracks. The control determines a target position along
the conveyor line. Unlike in actuating drives the positions can usually be
adjusted along the complete conveyor line. The selection of a suitable drive
should at ﬁrst be based on this basic classiﬁcation. In addition to the actual
driving module actuators or actuator systems consist of further components
which adjust the control signals in an adequate way to the requirements of
the drive (cf. Abb. 5.12).
Signal processing
The control values have possibly to be adjusted and converted for a further
processing by the actuator. On this input level the information images of
the electrical control value (e.g., digital/analogous) are converted and the
signal level is adjusted. In non-electrical drives the electrical input signal is
also converted into an adequate ﬂuid ﬂow depending on the medium (oil,
compressed-air) of the emergency current.

162
5. Automation of the Material Flow
Final control element
The drives are actually controlled by ﬁnal control elements9 which also regu-
late the energy supply. Depending on the emergency current the ﬁnal element
controls the electrical ﬂow or a ﬂuid ﬂow necessary for the operation of a hy-
draulic or pneumatic drive. In practice, the signal processor and the ﬁnal
control element often built a single unit. Integrated drive controls ensure
that the target values (speed, position check) speciﬁed by the controls sig-
nals are observed by returning the actual driving values. Furthermore, such
drive controls supervise the drive unit and in case of an overload can switch
oﬀthe drive.
Drive unit
The initiation and perpetuation of a movement at a machine require me-
chanical energy which is generated by the drive unit by means of the supply
emergency current and transmitted to the machine. According to the type of
the drive unit and the necessary movement translational (lifting cylinder) or
rotational drives (motors) have to be used. The mechanical movement gener-
ated by a drive unit has to be converted into the required movement for the
work machine by means of control shafts or crank drives.
In addition to electrical drives, in some areas of conveyor and warehouse
technology also hydraulic and above all pneumatic drives are used (cf. Table
5.3). In this context, special attention should be given to ﬂuid lifting cylinders
which are used as control drives in dispatching and sorting plants as well as
in palletizers and lifts.
5.4.2 Electrical drives
Since electrical networks are available in all companies and the electrical
energy can be stored in accumulators electric motors are often used for sta-
tionary and mobile material ﬂow operations.
According to their structure, functioning and operation the electric motors
commonly used in material ﬂow technology are classiﬁed as follows:
– Alternating ﬁeld machines (three-phase and alternating current motors)
– Commutator machines (direct current motors)
– Special forms (multiphase motors, linear drives)
The physical speciﬁcations of electro-dynamical drives are not described in
detail in this book. For further, more detailed information please refer to
[52, 57].
9 In literature this term has diﬀerent meanings. According to the German stan-
dards DIN 19221 or 19226 ﬁnal control elements here are considered as function
elements preceding the actual drive.

Three-phase asynchronous motors
Three-phase asynchronous motors (TAM) are alternating ﬁeld machines di-
rectly supplied from a three-phase power net. The structure and functioning
of such machines as well as the typical methods to adjust the revolution and
torque are described below.
At the periphery of the stator of a TAM pairwise connected coil halves
are mounted on opposite sides between which a magnetic ﬁeld is generated.
The number of coil pairs connected to a phase line determines the number of
pole pairs, a bipolar machine hat the number of pole pairs p = 1. Multipolar
machines have more pole pairs connected to their stator. Usually, two- or
four-polar machines are used with three or six coil pairs (in a three-phase
network).
The revolving ﬁeld is generated by the time mismatch of the phase current
by 120◦at the connected coils. It induces a ﬂow in the rotor which generates

Figure 5.13. Characteristics TAM
a magnetic ﬁeld with the same rotational direction as that of the outer stator
ﬁeld.
The torque generation in the rotor depends on how fast the magnetic
ﬂow between the stator and the rotor changes and is only maintained when
there is a slack s between the stator ﬁeld and the induced rotor ﬁeld. Only
when the machine is unloaded the revolution corresponds to the frequency
of the alternating ﬁeld (synchronous revolution nD, cf. ﬁg. 5.13). When the
machine is loaded the alternating ﬁeld precedes the rotation of the rotor, thus
the term asynchronous machine.
The rotor of a TAM is either a slip ring rotor with external connections
for the rotor coils or a squirrel-cage motor. Squirrel-cage motors or short-
circuit rotors have no rotor coils, but proﬁle bars made of copper, bronze or
aluminium which are connected with rings at both sides of the rotor. Squirrel-
cage motors are more robust and require less maintenance than slip ring
rotors, which because of their collectors are prone to failure due to burnout
or sparks. During start-up a TAM takes up the most energy, about ﬁve to
seven times the nominal current. To avoid surges in the network, eﬃcient
asynchronous motors with a capacity of 4 kW or more have to be equipped
with adequate jump starts. If a TAM should be used for RPM-regulated
drives additional control measures are necessary which will be described in
the following.
The delta-wye switch is a simple method to adjust the revolution but
can only be used in a ﬁxed revolution range.

Figure 5.14. Delta-wye switch
When the device is started in the delta-wye modus the coil ends of the
stator coil are bypassed at the connections U2, V2 and W2 and the con-
nections U1, V1 and W1 are directly connected to a phase connection of the
alternating current network (L1-L2-L3) (cf. ﬁg. 5.14). Thus, two adjacent sta-
tor coils are connected in series and because of the higher resistance between
the phase connections there is a lower start-up current. After the start-up
the machine is switched to delta, the power take-up and the corresponding
torque are increased by the factor three. The delta-wye switch is used as a
simple jump-starter for motors with a determined nominal revolution (lift
drives).
Without an additional circuit a TAM is operated with the revolution
determined by the number of pole pairs and the network frequency (50Hz)
and has the characteristics shown in ﬁg. 5.13.
In case of a pole pair switch motors with a so-called Dahland winding
are used. Their coils are switched at the periphery of the stator by a Dahland
switch. In case of four-pole machines (p = 2) either the adjacent or oppo-
site coils can be connected. The revolution of the alternating ﬁeld then is
3000 min−1 or 1500 min−1. Pole switches are only common for squirrel-cage
motors. They are also used as drives for lifting devices.
The operating characteristics of a TAM slip ring rotor can be inﬂuenced
by a slip control by installing an additional rotor circuit or by adjusting the
voltage.
The power induced in the rotor is weakened by resistors or power con-
version cascades in the rotor circuit and either dissipated as power loss to
the environment (resistors) or refed into the network. When the tension of
supply in the stator circuit is reduced, the start-up torque is reduced over-
proportionately (M ∼U 2) although this soft-start requires simple start-up
conditions (machines with low start-up torque).
The synchronous revolution of the circular stator ﬁeld and thus the driv-
ing revolution can be adjusted inﬁnitely and with low loss by means of a
frequency switch with a frequency converter. Frequency converters are in-

166
5. Automation of the Material Flow
stalled between the network and the motor where they rectify the alternating
current of the three-phase network and electronically generate a tension of
supply with a variable frequency and amplitude at the converter
The number of used frequency converters has increased in recent years
owing to the development of ever more eﬃcient and inexpensive devices. The
combination of frequency converter and squirrel-cage motors, thus, is a very
cheap and multifaceted drive which is more and more used in ﬁelds which
so far have only used direct current motors. [57]. When they are combined
with a frequency converter and high-resolution angle transmitters which are
mounted at the drive shaft more and more TAM are used instead of the
common direct current motors.
Direct current motors
Direct current motors oﬀer a series of diﬀerent features:
– Inﬁnitely adjustable revolution over a large range
– Highly stable revolution (little changes of revolution also when loaded and
unregulated)
– High synchronization (consistent revolution)
– Highly dynamical (acceleration capability)
Disadvantages are a high wear and tear at the moving current-carrying
contacts because of mechanical friction and burnout. Stationary operation
furthermore requires a synchronized well-smoothed voltage which has to be
generated by additional aggregates.
Direct current motors can be operated as shown in ﬁg. 5.15 by unequally
connecting the stator and rotor windings. The functioning of a direct current
motor is mainly inﬂuenced by the type of excitation and classiﬁed as follows.
In switch motors the armature and ﬁeld windings are arranged in line
and operated with the same voltage.
The torque characteristics of the switch motor are calculated from the
armature voltage UA, the resistance of the armature circuit RA as well as the
machine invariables cM according to eq. 5.1 into
M = cm·φ·UA
RA
−(cm·φ)2·n
RA·2·π
(5.1)
In case of an invariable ﬂow φ and a constant armature voltage UA the
characteristic is linear.
The start-up behavior is inﬂuenced by an adjustable started switched in
series to the armature which can be bypassed during operation. When the
values of the starter resistor are lower the characteristic curves ﬂatten so that
the start-up torque and the start-up power can be reduced. The ﬁeld winding
also passes the starter so that the self-induction voltage is bypassed via the
starter resistor and the armature circuit when the machine is switched oﬀ. A
disadvantage is the low eﬃciency due to the power loss in the starter control.

Figure 5.15. Excitations of direct current motors
In a series motor the ﬁeld and armature winding are switched in series
and are thus operated with a direct current.
Unlike in a switch motor revolution and torque are not linear because of
the electric circuit (cf. ﬁg. 5.15). This motor is marked by an easily adjustable
revolution and a high start-up torque. It is mainly used in lifts and drives at
unsteady conveyors.
In view of their characteristic curve series motors must not be operated
unloaded or equipped with just a revolution control. When the load moment
sinks the revolution may rise to a critical value and the resulting centrifugal
force may lead to a “runaway”.
The revolution can be controlled by a ﬁeld controller arranged parallel to
the ﬁeld winding or by tapping the ﬁeld winding, i.e., by reducing the number
of windings.
The compound motor has a series winding in addition to the switch
ﬁeld winding. If both windings are wound in the same direction, the revolu-
tion behavior is between that of a switch motor and that of a series motor.
Revolution and torque are inﬂuenced similar to a series of switch motor. The

168
5. Automation of the Material Flow
term compounding (cf. Fig. 5.15) describes the design and use of the ﬁeld
winding.
Separately excited motors require separate power supplies for the
armature and ﬁeld circuit. The mechanical structure corresponds to that
of a switch motor. Since armature and ﬁeld circuit are separated the exciter
ﬁeld remains constant when the voltage is reduced. Thus, the revolution is
more stable than in a switch motor (more stable drive). The revolution is
proportionate to the adjacent armature voltage.
For smaller motors permanent magnets are used instead of an electric sep-
arate excitation. These motors are used, for example, as ﬁnal control elements
for valves or as servo motors.
5.4.3 Fluid drives
Hydraulic and pneumatic drives are used as driving and control elements in
conveyors and warehouse facilities. Although electric drives can also be used
for these tasks and are more common ﬂuid actuators are more economical
and functional for certain applications because of their compact construction.
The function elements of ﬂuid drives are:
– Pressure generators, pumps (hydraulic) or compressors and compressed-air
containers (pneumatic)
– Drives (lift cylinders, axial, radial piston engines)
– Final control elements (valves to control the ﬂuid ﬂow)
– Wires and pipes to transport the medium (oil, air)
The compressed-air for pneumatic plants can be provided by a central
compressor which supplies all decentralized outlets throughout the company
via pipelines. On the other hand, the compression for hydraulic systems has
to be generated in the direct vicinity to the drive for safety reasons and to
return the medium into the closed cycle.
In stationary facilities electrical compressors are used while hydraulic ve-
hicle are operated with electric as well as combustion engines. Hydraulic
drives are characterized by a high power density (transmission of large forces
within a small area) and an excellent drive stability.
Typical applications for translational hydraulic drives are scissor-lift ta-
bles and lifts as well as lifting devices at fork-lift trucks. Hydraulic motors
are also used in very small rotation engines in stacker drives (hub motors).
Final control elements in ﬂuid systems are mechanically and mainly electri-
cally operated distributing and control valves which control the ﬂuid ﬂow and
limit or regulate the ﬂow and pressure. The main characteristics of hydraulic
systems are described in Table 5.4.
Pneumatic drives are mainly used as ﬁnal control elements in swivel de-
vices, pushers or stoppers in conveyor belts and in sorting and distributing
facilities. The required capacity is lower and no high requirements are put

5.5 Interfaces in automation systems
Computer systems sensors, actuators and periphery components have to be
linked by suitable interfaces to ensure a smooth data exchange. According
to the presentation of the information of a transmitted signal, the point-to-
point interfaces can basically be divided into binary and digital interfaces.
The digital data transmission is, furthermore, divided into a serial and a
parallel transmission.
An important criterion for the selection of an interface is the quantity and
speed of the data to be transmitted.

170
5. Automation of the Material Flow
Figure 5.16. Equivalent circuit diagram for a current interface
While large data quantities of up to some Mbytes are transmitted between
ERP systems and master computers (cf. Chapter 7) only small data quantities
of only a few bytes are transmitted on the ﬁeld level between sensor, actuators
and a process-oriented control. These data, however, have to be transmitted
in realtime to ensure that messages about rapid status changes can be sent
to the control without delay.
Based on the variety of communication requirements, diﬀerent types of
interfaces have been established which are each used for special applications.
In the following interfaces common in subordinate automation technologies
in warehouse management systems their characteristics and ﬁelds of applica-
tions are described.
5.5.1 Analogous and binary data transmission
The classical and technically most advanced method to connect ﬁeld-oriented
components is the use of a two-position or parallel connection where all sen-
sor or actuators are connected star-shaped with the control by a pair of
unscreened cores each.
Via this interface analogous as well as binary signals can continuously be
transmitted between two terminals. In a current interface10 (cf. Fig. 5.16) an
analogous signal is standardized to a signal level of 0 or 4 to 20 mA and to
0V and 10V for voltage interfaces.
When current interfaces are used the analogous signal is not tampered
by ohm losses caused by the output resistance. This is the case with volt-
age interfaces so that without an additional ampliﬁcation the transmission
distances are limited to some meters.
The output signal of the sensors is adapted to the signal range of the
respective interface and is converted by a PLC or process computer in the
input module into a digital variable for further processing.
10 The most common terms are TTY or current loop.

5.5 Interfaces in automation systems
171
At this interface mainly binary signal transmitters and actuators are con-
nected with a superordinate control (PLC). No special requirements are put
on the wires because the binary transmission with a usual voltage of 0V and
24V is relatively failure-free also over larger distances thanks to the switching
tolerance of a PLC (cf. 5.2.2).
A disadvantage, above all in large plants with many inputs and outputs,
is the extensive wiring since each device needs its own pair of cables. For this
reason the two-position connection is mainly used for the local connection
of a limited n umber of sensors and actuators to decentralized controllers or
connection modules of ﬁeld busses.
5.5.2 Digital data transmission
Serial and parallel interfaces are the basic tools for the digital data transmis-
sion between computer systems and periphery or automation components.
Both methods are presented in the following together with the prevalent in-
dustrial standards and typical characteristics (transmission rate, length of
wires, interface design).
Parallel interface
Many PCs oﬀer the possibility to control periphery devices via a parallel
interface and to transmit data byte by byte. Other than serial interface paral-
lel interfaces (Table 5.7) allow for a high data transmission rate. Due to the
relatively long wires and the high expenditure these interfaces are only used
to connect local devices, above all printers [58].
The connection between a PC and a printer consists of a 25-pole Centron-
ics cable11. In addition to the eight data lines (D0 - D7) and the signal mass
(GND) additional poles are needed for the so-called hardware handshake
which controls the communication between the two devices. The respective
control lines are set at both sides of the sender and receiver to show that
data are available at the interface (BSY ) and can be taken over by the re-
ceiver. Furthermore, the receivers acknowledge if the printer has successfully
received data (ACK - Acknowledge12). Further control lines show the status
of the printer (PE - Paper End, ONL - Online) or reset both communication
partners to a deﬁned initial status (RESET). The voltage is between 0V and
5 V.
Serial interfaces
During a serial data transmission the digital information is transmitted
sequentially bit by bit. Instead of eight or more data line for a parallel,
11 Another form with higher transmission rates in the SCSI standard which is also
used to connect external devices but requires additional hardware (controller).
12 The signal description shows that the signal is activated in case of a falling edge,
e.g., at a signal voltage of 0V.

character-by-character transmission, only one line or pole pair is necessary,
depending on the design. Thus the wiring expenditure is generally smaller.
The standard RS232 speciﬁes the physical interface for a serial data ex-
change between two terminals as a point-to-point connection. This kind of
interface requires one data cable for each transmission direction. For a full
duplex transmission (cf. Chapter 7) where both users can send and receive
simultaneously at least three poles (transmission, receiving and ground line)
have to be connected.
The signals are transmitted via a bipolar voltage interface with a typical
signal level of +3V to +12V or “High” to “Low” compared to the ground
potential. Due to the ground connection, the line is more sensitive to exter-
nal electro-magnetic disturbances. Furthermore, the ohm and capacity losses
reduce the maximum transmission rate and the length of the wires. In case
of a digital serial data transmission, the same electro-technical conditions
occur as during a binary or analogous signal transmission. The line capacity
which in this version together with the line resistance RL builds an RC-link
inevitably inﬂuences the signal transmission and thus limits the maximum
transmission rate (cf. Fig. 5.17).
RS232-interfaces are mainly used to connect PC periphery components
with only little requirements on the interference resistance and data integrity,

Universal serial bus USB(USB) is another industrial standard for serial
interfaces for the connection of periphery devices, which unlike RS232 are
bus-compatible.
Compared to RS232, the USB has a higher transmission rate, similar to
that of the Ethernet13 and oﬀers the great advantage that periphery devices
can be plugged in and out while the PC is running. Another advantage is
that the supply voltage is also fed into the bus so that many USB devices
do not need a separate power supply. With regard to the short wire lengths,
however, USB can only be used to connect local computer peripheries.
The interfaces R422 and RS485 transmit the data by means of ﬂoat-
ing voltage signals. A two-wire line for each channel is included in the ca-
ble (Fig. 5.18). Four data lines are required for a full duplex transmission.
Thanks to their physical transmission principles, both interfaces are failure-
free and can thus be operated with smaller signal levels and higher transmis-
sion rates14˙In the two-wire version RS485 is the most widespread standard
for ﬁeld bus systems.
5.5.3 Field bus systems
On the control and ﬁeld level ﬁeld bus systems are used to connect ﬁeld
devices (sensors, actuators) with the ﬁeld-oriented control.
Field busses are used for several reasons:
– To reduce the expenditure for the planning, projection and realization com-
pared to a star-shaped single connection of ﬁeld components
– To use a standardized data communication for all users
13 The USB standard 1.1 provides for 1.5 or 12MBit/s, USB 2.0 for a maximum of
480MBit/s.
14 The most important factor is the time for the growth of the signal edge which
because of the lower voltage level is shorter.

– To reduce the expenditure for the software implementation by uniform
interfaces and telegrams
– To render the digital and above all the analogous I/O modules in the
control unnecessary
– To ensure a higher ﬂexibility towards changes and reconstructions
In ﬁeld busses data can be transmitted via an electrical line (typ. two-wire
line), a light conductor or a wireless transmission channel. Electric two-wire
lines according to IEE 802.3 (Ethernet), RS485 or IEC 1158-2 are the most
popular interfaces in the automation of production and material ﬂow.
Optical wave guides are mainly used in explosive areas in process engi-
neering because of their high failure resistance and intrinsic safety. An electric
intrinsically safe version of IEC 1158-2 has been speciﬁed with a reduced sig-
nal voltage and currents and a maximum transmission rate as to avoid an
ignition of the environmental mixture of gases.
Busses are designed as direct serial connections between the users and
according to the topology they may be a bus (line), tree or ring. While the
users communicate, data are exchanged by telegrams where the actual user
data and ID are stored. The connection structure ensures that all users are
connected to the bus at the same time and principally can send data simulta-
neously. This would inevitably lead to a communication breakdown. To keep
the data exchange failure-free regulations have to be set up which control the
access on the bus:
CSMA/CD - Carrier sense multiple access / collision detect This
is a decentralized access method which principally allows each user to send
a telegram at any time. The users check before each transmission if other
stations use the bus (CS-MA). If no communication takes place a telegram
can be sent. Because of the signal runtimes, which in large networks can
be very long, two diﬀerent users may send two telegrams at the same time.

5.5 Interfaces in automation systems
175
Should the data collide the transmission is cancelled and the telegram is
resent at random (CD).
CSMA/CD was designed as an access method for busses with many users
(e.g., Ethernet). The busses are conﬁgured for a clear user address. Due to
the undeterminate access such a bus is not realtime compatible.
Master-slave describes a method where a user (master) centrally controls
the communication with the bus and grants transmission rights to to other
users (slaves). All slaves are cyclically addressed by the master, the access
frequency of single slaves can be parameterized in the bus master.
Thus, each user has access onto the bus in a ﬁxed order and for a deﬁned
period of time. This fulﬁlls the requirement for a realtime capability. It is a
disadvantage, however, that no communication is possible when the bus mas-
ter breaks down. The data transmission between two slaves is more complex
since it is done in two telegrams via the master. The cycle time increases in
line with the number of users so that the latter is limited. Furthermore, each
time a user is added or removed the master has to be reconﬁgured.
Token-passing is a communication method where a special telegram (token)
is exchanged in turn between all users. When a user receives the token he
is granted the transmission rights and may send a data telegram to the bus.
After a deﬁned period of time the token is handed over to the next user.
Since the token retention period is deﬁned by the controller the response
time per cycle is predetermined. The users can communicate directly with
each other and there is no communication overhead as in the master-slave
method. Here as well, the cycle time increases in line with the number of users
and the bus has also to be reconﬁgured when users are added or removed.
In case of the sum frame method which in Interbus-S controls the access
onto the bus the process and parameter registers of all bus users are rep-
resented by a so-called sum frame, which cyclically circulates in the bus.
The bus is a physical ring line with two pole pairs. Each user functions like
a shift register which receives a byte from the neighbouring user via an in-
terface connection, moves the internal register contents by one location and
sends the removed byte to the next user from the other interface connection.
Additional bits in the data ﬂow hold a code which bytes on the bus are read
or written by the users. A cycle is thus deﬁned by the number of bytes and
control bits in the sum frame and the determined data rate.
This transmission method is very eﬃcient thanks to the telegram over-
heads. In addition to this, the consistency of the data in the sum frame is
automatically ensured by the procedure. However, several cycles are required
to transmit larger data blocks. As with the master-slave method no commu-
nication is possible when the master breaks down. In this bus conﬁguration

this is also the case when a slave has broken down. Here as well, the bus has
to be reconﬁgured when new users are added.
For a ﬁeld bus implementation (cf. Table 5.8) the implementations of the
bus communication methods of the suppliers are deﬁned.
Because of the large variety of diﬀerent products, there is no uniform
standard for ﬁeld bus systems. For this reason, the bus systems of diﬀerent

5.5 Interfaces in automation systems
177
providers are compatible only under certain circumstances. But the busses of
diﬀerent providers can be connected by means of additional bus converters.
The Actuator-sensor interface (ASI15) plays a special role because it is no
ﬁeld bus in the narrower sense, but was developed especially for the connec-
tion of binary sensors and actuators. In addition to binary data, the bus also
transmits the emergency current for the power supply of the connected ﬁeld
devices; four binary ﬁeld devices each can be connected to the bus by a max-
imum of eight coupling modules. The number of users for each bus segment
is limited to 31, the slave address 0 is not assigned.
Independent of the telegram structure the number of users in the bus
is physically limited by the electrical line characteristics and by the power
consumption of the slaves. To increase the number of users repeaters are
used as ampliﬁers but not in ﬁeld busses with a ﬁxed telegram structure
(e.g., interbus and ASI).
Since ﬁeld busses are used for a large range of applications the suitable
choice largely depends on the concrete communication requirements. A gen-
eral statement about the suitability of a certain bus system cannot be given.
Busses working according to the token-passing procedure should preferred
for realtime critical applications because they have a deterministic response
time behaviour because of the predictable token runtime. In these systems,
the breakdown of the master causes almost no problems because each other
user may also be the master.
15 The term actuator-sensor interface is also used.

6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
The immediate automatic identiﬁcation of objects (auto-ID) for the manage-
ment and control of processes in production and logistics is a basic element of
each WMS. The immediate faultless identiﬁcation of objects is an elementary
condition for an eﬃcient process for which automatic identiﬁcation (auto-ID)
is the basis.
The tasks to be fulﬁlled in a warehouse put diﬀerent requirements on the
information technology and the choice of an adequate code. These are among:
– An ensured reading reliability under the given conditions
– A suﬃcient reading speed for existing and planned conveyor techniques
– The possibility to generate a suﬃcient number of identiﬁcation tags.
– A reading distance adjustable to the given conditions.
– An ensured compatibility to other supply chain members.
– The cost eﬃciency of identiﬁcation systems and operating means.
The choice of a suitable identiﬁcation system requires an understanding of
the basic auto-ID principles and techniques which are studied in the following.
In more than 70% of auto-ID application the barcode is the most commonly
used method and therefore it is given special attention. But the promising
transponder technology will be discussed as well.
6.1 Codes and characters
In the German standard DIN 44300 part 2 the Deutsche Institut f¨ur Normung
deals with the presentation of information and the related terminology and
deﬁned codes:
“A regulation for the clear assignment (encoding) of characters out of
a character set (original set) to those of another character set (image
set). Note: The assignment is not necessarily bijective.” [19]
Thus, a code is a character set for the representation of original sets by
image sets during the encoding including the rule for its presentation [7].
Encoding means the conversion of one character set into another. Thus, a
character is:

180
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
“An element (type) out of a ﬁnite quantity of objects deﬁned for
the presentation of information (character set) as well as each image
(copy) of such an element.”[19]
It is explicitly diﬀerentiated between the element and its image or the type
and the copy. Therefore, a character as an object out of the character set
may appear several times in the image.
6.1.1 Encoding
Encoding can be described mathematically as an image C which assigns
elements of the quantity A (characters of the original set, source alphabet)
to elements of the quantity B.
c : A →B
The characters of the original set can be combined into character chains and
thus words of the target alphabet. If the image C is bijective this is also called
the decodability of the code.
It has to be pointed out, however, that the decodability of character chains
of a target alphabet B built of the image C is not always desired. The pass-
words of an operating system (UNIX), for example, are encoded in such a way
as to avoid a clear decoding. Especially in case of passwords, it is important
to compare the words with the image set.
6.1.2 Encoding examples
By means of the character set of the alphabet A with A = {a , b , c , . . ., z}
the single characters can be encoded into another system, e.g., into Braille or
embossed printing. Braille translates each character into 3×2-matrixes M 3,2
with the elements mij, with mij ∈{0, 1} and i ∈{1, 2, 3} as well as j ∈{1, 2}.
A blind person cannot see the elements 0 and 1; therefore, these signs
are embossed on a sheet of paper. Since the number of elements in Braille is
larger than the number of characters in the alphabet1 and the characters are
clearly assigned to a dot combination Braille texts can be decoded.
Another well-known encoding method is the Morse alphabet where the
characters are translated into our alphabet by sounds2. The target set actu-
ally consists of only four signs: a short and a long sound as well as a short
1 Actually there are more Braille characters than characters in the alphabet if
upper and lower cases are not considered. But some dot combinations are used
for special characters like full stops, asterisks, exclamation marks, etc. but also
to build syllables and thus to improve the readability.
2 In everyday life quite a variety of encodings can be found, e.g., the encoding
of music data [26] which can be read by man and machine thanks to diﬀerent
notations.

Figure 6.1. Example of a character encoding with Braille
and a long pause between the single sounds and a still longer pause between
the single characters. Without the longer pause the single Morse characters
could not be diﬀerentiated.
In contrast to Braille, which builds alphabetic characters with diﬀerent
combinations of six dots, the Morse code is error prone because it allows for
the generation of sound sequences with diﬀerent numbers of sounds. Messages
are decoded for diﬀerent reasons. In this case, however, it is advisable to give
special consideration to the image and target set, the purpose and ﬁeld of
application, the density of information and the error rate prior to developing
a new code but also prior to choosing an already existing encoding system.
6.2 1D–Codes
If the symbols of the Morse code for short and long sounds, i.e., the dots and
lines, were heightened and the pauses were presented as spaces this would
resemble a barcode. But this barcode would be diﬃcult to read by machines
and — as described earlier — would be error-prone. If, for example, an e
consists of a short and a t of a long sound the a is built of a long and a
short sound. Because of the high misinterpretation rate in case of incorrect
pauses between the single sounds and the combined sounds such an encoding
method is inadequate.
Telegraphy is an old technique. When on 4 September 1837 the ﬁrst Morse
telegram was sent, nobody thought about barcodes. It was not until 1949
when the barcode was patented3 setting the basis for the automatic identiﬁ-
cation.
Codes do not depend on their physical presentation. Typically, Morse
signs are read acoustically, Braille signs tactilely and barcodes optically4.
3 On 20 October 1949 Norman J. Woodland and Bernard Silver presented their
invention which on 7 October 1952 got the patent number 2612994 and set the
basis for the barcode [81].
4 In case of bad environmental conditions, other physical presentations such as
slotted plates are used which are not scanned and read optically but inductively.

182
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
Here, the light reﬂected by the barcode label is recorded and converted into
electric signals.
With the advancement of opto-electronics in the 1950s and 1960s and the
call for a quicker identiﬁcation of objects, triggered by the growing queues at
the cash points in self-service shops and supermarkets [33], the code 2/5 (also
2 out of 5) was introduced for the ﬁrst time in 1968. This type of barcode is
still used today5.
6.2.1 Code 2/5
First of all the diﬀerent barcode symbols have to be classiﬁed into double-
width and multi-width codes. Some symbols use only two diﬀerent widths for
their lines and one constant width for the spaces Fig. 6.3). More advanced
multi-width codes use more than two diﬀerent widths. The code 128, for
example, works with four diﬀerent widths for lines and spaces (cf. Fig. 6.9).
Other diﬀerences are:
– the sign intervals (e.g., numerical or alpha-numerical)
– the interleaving (the use of spaces for the transmission of information cf.
section 6.2.3)
Non-overlapping double-width codes or barcodes of the ﬁrst generation,
like the 2/5 codes are a simple graphical binary image. Digits are coded
binary with lines of two diﬀerent widths (a narrow line for a zero and a wide
one for a one). Each digit is built of ﬁve lines: two wide and three narrow
ones. When systems with ﬁve elements are built by permuting two elements
of a set, whereas one element has to appear twice in the new image, there
are exactly
5
2

=
5!
2!(5−2)! = 10 (combinations without repetition) possible
systems. Thus, the ten digits 0...9 can be encoded.
The barcode has a deﬁned start and a deﬁned end. It is not enough to
print a number of bars one after the other to represent the single digits, but
a stop code has to be set at the start and the end.
Since with 2 out of 5, the symbol set is exhausted by the presentation of
the digits 0 . . . 9. The S start and end symbol 2 out of 3, consisting of two
wide and one narrow bar, are used (cf. Fig. 6.2).
Start and end symbols are used as start as well as stop characters for the
scan process. Barcode scanners work independently of the orientation of the
barcode. To ensure a secure scan all bars have to be scanned independently
of the reading direction. Each set of barcode symbols requires a unique pair of
start and stop symbols. Furthermore, the trigger helps to identify the barcode
symbologies.
During its lifetime an object may have been “labelled” with several bar-
codes. In case of an insuﬃcient coordination, for example, the companies
5 The code 2/5 was developed by Identicon Corporation.

Figure 6.2. Start and stop symbols of the code 2/5
participating in the supply chain possibly use internal barcodes. If the code
belongs to a diﬀerent symbology, this is recognized by the scanner and trans-
mitted selectively. This helps to reduce the number of faulty identiﬁcations
and improves the correct assignment. Generally, the scanners can be conﬁg-
ured for the selective transmission of certain barcode symbologies.
An important feature of all barcodes is the code length, and thus the
space it requires when printed. The diﬀerent barcode symbologies meet the
requirement for a maximum of information on a minimum of space in diﬀerent
ways.
The most narrow element in a barcode (the narrow line) is also called
module and its width is the width of this most narrow element. In the code
2/5 the width of the wide bar Sf usually is trice as wide as the module, i.e.,
as the narrow bar which in the following is called Sd. The blank Sz between
two bars has the double module width. The length Lz of a digit code can
now easily be determined:
Lz = 2Sf + 3Sd + 5Sz = 19Sd

184
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
Thus, the length of a digit code is 19 times the module width. Five spaces are
needed to separate the ﬁve bars because the next digit code also starts with a
black bar. Analogously the start character can be determined by Ls = 13Sd
while the stop character is determined by Le = 11Sd. Le is clearly shorter
since unlike Ls Le is not followed by another character.
Each barcode has to be preceded and followed by a space to avoid faulty
scans. This space is called quiet zone Rz; the quiet zone has to be ten times
as wide as the module, but at least 2.5 mm (cf. [70]): Rz = 10Sd. The total
encoding for n digits has a length Ltotal of:
Lges = 2Rz + Ls + nLz + Le
Based on the concrete module width the absolute length of the barcode
can be determined.
Table 6.1 shows the symbols for code 2/5. If, for example, the digits 4465
should be encoded with the code 2/5 together with the start and stop code
this would result in the concatenation6 of the combinations of bars (in Table
6.1) as is shown in Fig. 6.3.

Figure 6.3. The digits 4465 in code 2/5
The characters of code 2/5 shown in Table 6.1 and the system described
above have a high error detection rate. According to the regulation, a single
digit has to consist of ﬁve bars, two wide and three narrow ones.
Fig. 6.4 shows a faulty barcode for the digit 4. The results diﬀer depending
on how the scanner reads this code: Scan A actually identiﬁes the digit 4 with
the binary pattern 00101 while scan C identiﬁes the binary pattern 10001 and
thus the digit 1. Scan B, on the other hand, detects an error in the binary
pattern 10101 because there are exactly two wide bars in each digit code.
However, is is quite unlikely that such an error would occur, i.e., that in a
case like in Fig. 6.4 the digit 1 would be read because there would have to be
6 In the following the concatenation, i.e., the chaining of characters and character
chains is marked by the operator ⊕. The concatenation is not to be confused
with the addition +.

Figure 6.4. Code 2/5 partially with errors in the printing image. A,B,C: Scan lines
two errors in one character which would result in a readable character with
two wide and three narrow bars7.
There are three diﬀerent scan methods:
– The correct scan of the code (A in Fig. 6.4).
– The faulty scan which is signalled by a corresponding error message by the
scanner(B in Fig. 6.4).
– The unrecognized faulty scan “WrongRead” which returns an image which
does not correspond to the actual code (C in Fig. 6.4).
– The “NoRead” i.e., the message that something was scanned but could not
be identiﬁed
– The NoRead that is not acknowledged by the hardware.
This clearly shows the advantages of the code 2/5, compared to the above-
mentioned presentation of characters in the Morse alphabet. The following
section shows that the error detection in a barcode and the safety of this
system can still be improved considerably.
6.2.2 Check digit calculation Code 2/5
The occurrence of a substitution error, i.e., the opposed alternation of two bar
widths in a digit barcode is highly unlikely but has still to be expected. This
error can further be eliminated by a check digit as the last character before
the stop character. With this simple but eﬃcient method the unrecognized
scan of a substitution error can be reduced by more than 50 percent:
Starting at the right, one can add up the active digits ci of the digit
to be encoded are multiplied alternately by three and one and results: s =
3 × c1 + 1 × c2 + 3 × c3 + 1 × c4 + 3 × c5 + . . .. The sum s is calculated modulo
ten8 a = s mod 10 and the result a is subtracted from ten. The resulting c0
corresponds to the check digit. However, if c0 = 10 c0 is set to c0 = 0:
c0 =

7 Environmental impacts aﬀect the optical and geometrical properties of the bar-
code label. Diﬀerent processes have been developed to improve the scan quality.
A promising solution is the use of fuzzy barcode decoders in the form of software
[8].
8 Whereas the operation modulo corresponds to the remaining value after division
by a number. Example: 17 mod 5 because 17/2 = 3.

186

According to this formula the check digit for 124 is (10 −((4 × 3 + 2 × 1 +
1 × 3) mod 10)) mod 10 = 3.

Figure 6.5. Digits 124 in code 2/5 with check digit
The generation of a check digit is obligatory because it is a regular part of
the code 2/5. A missing check digit would lead to a recognizable error or an
unrecognized wrong read. The number 31509, for example, can be encoded
as 315098 after generation of the check digit. If this check digit is missing the
number 31509 is decoded as 3150 because 9 is the check digit of the number
3150, while 0 is the check digit of 315, 5 the check digit of 31 and 1 the check
digit of 3. There is a possibility of 10% for each combination of digits that the
last digit is a valid check digit. To reduce faulty or wrong reads is one aspect
which has to be considered when choosing barcode symbologies for the au-
tomatic identiﬁcation. If the scan rate in a warehouse, for example, is 10.000
units/hour an error rate of one-tenth of a percent would lead to an average
of ten events which typically would require manual correction. Depending on
where in the warehouse this error occurs, it would need additional manpower
to correct it and the consolidation of orders would fail.
The choice of the right barcode symbology and the correct technical print
and scan is a decisive factor. Furthermore, a warehouse planning always
should consider the question of what would happen in case of a wrong read
of a barcode.
6.2.3 Code 2/5 interleaved
Based on code 2/5 in 1972 the code 2/5 interleaved was introduced. The
code 2/5 interleaved can be seen as a reﬁnement of the conventional code
2/5 because the spaces between the black bars are used for the information
transfer so that the information density is much higher. The spaces are used
as shown in Table 6.1 whereas the codes are included in the white spaces
instead of in the black bars. Accordingly, these white spaces have diﬀerent
widths, three times narrow and two times wide. For the code of the number

6.2 1D–Codes
187
z (including the check digit) with z = cn ⊕cn−1 ⊕. . .⊕c1 ⊕c0 it applies that
each ci with an even index i is presented by a black bar while each ci with
an odd index i is presented by a white bar.
Since the code 2/5 interleaved represents a barcode symbology of its own,
it gets a new start and stop character (cf. Fig. 6.6).
= Start,
= Stop
Figure 6.6. Start and stop symbol of the code 2/5 interleaved
The following applies to the start symbol: It consists of four narrow bars
(two black and two white)9 in the sequence black, white, black and white,
Ls = 4Sd. The stop symbol consists of one wide black bar followed by a
white narrow one and is terminated by a black wide bar; the length is Le =
Sf + Sd + Sd = 3Sd + 2Sd = 5Sd. This makes the code 2/5 interleaved much
more compact.

Figure 6.7. The number 4465 in code 2/5 interleaved without start and stop
character and without check digit
Fig. 6.7 shows the structure of the code 2/5 interleaved: Instead of a ﬁxed
width for the spaces these have the same width as the bar of the following
symbol.
As can easily be seen in the code 2/5 interleaved only odd numbers of
digits can be encoded so that the number of bars will be even when the check
digit has been added. When the number of digits is even the set has to start
with a zero. The encoding of two digits is Lz = 2(2Sf + 3Sd) = 18Sd and,
thus, has one module width less than a digit encoded with the conventional
code 2/5. When even numbers of digits have to be completed by a zero
considerably more information can be packed on the same space.
9 Because the start symbol in any case will be followed by other bar sequences the
last bar has to be a white one.

188
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
124
Figure 6.8. Digits 124 in code 2/5 interleaved with check digit
While in code 2/5, the width (including quiet zone) is b2/5 for n digits
with b2/5 = n × 19Sd + 44Sd (with n ∈{1, 2, 3...}) the code 2/5 interleaved
for n digits has a ﬁxed width of b2/5i of b2/5i = (n + (n mod 2)) × 9Sd + 29Sd.
It has to be said, however, that the higher information density reduces
the tolerance. The code 2/5 interleaved is self-checking but the error rate has
increased considerably because the spaces (blanks) also include information.
Today more than 200 diﬀerent ID-barcodes are known. [70].
6.2.4 Code 128
A typical and often used multi-width code is the code 128, which is based on
four diﬀerent widths as well as on three bars and three spaces per character
and thus can represent the complete ASCII characters10 from 0 to 127. The
total of the diﬀerent widths of the bars and spaces always corresponds to
the width of 11 modules. The number of modules used to represent the bars
is even and odd for the spaces. This allows for the early detection of errors
already during the scan. The only exception is the stop character as the 106th
character. It is the only character with 13 modules consisting of four bars and
three spaces followed by a limit line two modules wide.
Like the code 2/5 the code 128 is a continuous barcode because the spaces
are part of the code. In addition to the 128 ASCII characters, the repre-
sentable character set of the code 128 consists of 100 digit pairs (from 00
to 99), four special characters, four control characters, three diﬀerent start
characters and one stop character. Owing to the three diﬀerent character sets
(codes A-C) the code 128 can represent more than 200 characters with 106
diﬀerent barcodes.
10 These are the digits, lower and upper cases, fullstop, comma, control symbols
like tabs, backspace, enter... (ASCII = American Standard Code for Information
Interchange, a worldwide used standard).

A special feature of code 128 is that it can be arranged in lines so that
active digits can be encoded which exceed the maximum reading width of a
scanner.
6.2.5 Check digit calculation code 128
The code 128 also has a check digit p as the last sign before the stop character.
For the character set z with n elements and z = cn ⊕cn−1 ⊕. . . ⊕c1 this is
calculated according to the formula:
p =

s +
n

i=1
w(ci) × i

mod 103
In this case w is an image which assigns a value to a character set accord-
ing to Table 6.2, e.g.: w(a) = 65 or w(b) = 66.
As an example, the character sequence “sinus” should be encoded. Since
this word consists only of lower case characters the character set code B is
chosen. The character set is chosen by a character in the code, in this case
the character with the value 104 (cf. Table 6.2). According to the formula

192
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
above the check digit is built with p = (s + 1 × w(“s”) + 2 × w(“i”) + 3 ×
w(“n”) + 4 × w(“u”) + 5 × w(“s”)) mod 103.
The function w in Table 6.2 determines the values of the single alpha-
numerical characters p = (104+1×83+2×73+3×78+4×85+5×83) mod103.
The check digit for the character sequence “sinus” is (when the start
character is chosen for character set Code B) p = 1322 mod 103 = 86 and has
be added as character “v” (cf. Table 6.2) as stop character after the sequence
“sinus”.

This method for the calculation of a check digit applies for the code 128,
all other symbologies use another method for this purpose.
6.2.6 The character sets of the code 128
The code 128 consists of the three character sets code A, code B and code C
(code in code). The start character indicates whether the following code is a
code A, B or C:
“Code A” “Code B” “Code C”
Figure 6.10. Start symbols for code A, code B and code C of the code 128
Code A contains, in addition to the upper case characters digits and
punctuation characters, also the ASCII characters 0 to 31 which have a value
of 64 to 95. Code B, on the other hand, contains in this range the lower case
characters “a” to “z”11. Code C is completely diﬀerent from codes A and B.
11 Of course, umlauts can be represented when the ISO character set at the PC has
been conﬁgured accordingly. Then the symbol “{” could be “¨a” or the symbol “|”
an “¨o”. For compatibility reasons, however, special characters should be avoided
in warehouse applications.

With the digits 0 to 99 it represents the digit pairs “00” to “99” so that two
digits can be encoded by the bar sequence representing one character.
This is demonstrated by the following example where the digits “4465”
are encoded with all three character sets.

In code A a start and stop symbol and a check digit are required in
addition to the digits “4465”, i.e., a total of 7 bars. Since each character,
except the stop character with a width of 13 modules, has a width of 11
modules the required space is 6 × 11 + 13 module widths. The stop character
corresponds to a character with the value of 4, i.e., the character “$”.

Figure 6.12. Numerical sequence “4465” with check digit in code 128 code B
In code B the same sequence “4465” starts with a diﬀerent start character
for code B. Since in code B the value (cf. Table 6.2) of the character is higher
by a factor one than in code A the check digit is also higher by one, the
character with the value 5, i.e., the symbol %.
When only digits are represented the density can be drastically increased
by switching to code, which represents a pair of digits with one character,
“44” as well as “65” are represented by one bar. A barcode in code C thus
has 2 characters less or is by 2 × 11 module widths narrower than barcodes
in code A or B. Regarding the active characters code C achieves a double
density for numerical codes compared to codes A and B [49].

Figure 6.13. Numerical sequence “4465” with check digit in code 128 code C
Since a barcode in code C always requires an even number of digits a
solution has to be found to represent odd numbers of digits. One possibility
is to add a zero as ﬁrst character.
6.2.7 Mixed character sets in code 128 and their optimization
In the code 128 the 200 characters of the three character sets can be mixed and
combined freely. If lower and upper case characters and special characters are
used in one sequence it can be switched between codes A, B and C. For this
purpose, the code start character (103-105) is inserted. From that character
on the character set of the other code applies until a stop character appears
or the code is changed.
In addition to this, it can be switched from code A to code B and vice
versa with the <SHIFT> symbol (character 98). The character following the
<SHIFT> symbol (and only this) is represented in the character set of the
other code. A switch to code C explicitly requires insertion of the character
with the value 105 (code C) while a switch from code C to code A or B has
also to be explicitly indicated.
A barcode can be optimized considerably by the clever use of the three
diﬀerent codes. However, to optimize and increase the information density it
is necessary to analyze the characters to be encoded in advance. When more
than four digits follow each other, the required space for the barcode can be
reduced by switching to code C.
When a character sequence begins with two digits it does not matter if
the barcode starts with code A or B or with code C. A start with code C,
the representation of the digit pair and the switch to code A or code B needs
three characters and thus 3 × 11 modules. The initial encoding of two digits
with either code A or B has the same length.
The situation is diﬀerent when the digit pair is not at the beginning of
the character sequence to be encoded. In such a case a switch has to be made
from code A or B into code C, the digit pair has to be represented, and then
it has to be returned to code A or B. Three characters are required for this
procedure. If, however, code A or B is maintained only two characters are

6.2 1D–Codes
195
needed to represent the two digits so that the required space is narrower by
11 modules widths. When four or more digits follow each other it is more
eﬃcient to switch to code C.
In case of an odd number of subsequent digits higher than four, it has
to be determined when the code switch should take place. If the numerical
sequence stands at the beginning of a character sequence the bar code should
start with code C to minimize the required space. In case of an odd numerical
sequence in the middle or at the end of a character sequence, code C should
be used only after the ﬁrst digit.
The switch from code A to code B has also to be studied more closely:
A switch from code A to code B can be performed at any time but if it has
to be initiated by a <SHIFT> symbol for a single character or for a longer
character sequence depends on the individual case. If a single character can
be represented by the character set of the other code the best solution is
a <SHIFT>. In case of two digits, it does not matter whether a switch or
double switch is chosen while for three or more characters a code switch is
to be preferred.
If, on the other hand, two characters of another code are at the end of
a character sequence the <SHIFT> symbol for these two characters would
prolong the barcode by 11 modules compared to a switch because this would
require no back-switch.
Generally, the choice of the optimal character set in code 128 is no trivial
pursuit. Optimizations can well be achieved while the wrong switch may
prolong the barcode drastically.
The characters <FNC3> and <FNC4> are included in the code 128 but
reserved for special or future use. Here, FNC means “Function code”. The
character <FNC2> induces the scanner to change into the multiline mode,
to store the scans and to go to the beginning of the new sequence after the
next scan. Since <FNC2> may appear several times this method allows for
the reading of very long barcode sequences if supported by the scanner.
In combination with one of the three start characters the last character
to be scanned <FNC1> introduces an EAN 128 code – quasi as a twin start
character.
6.2.8 Code sizes, tolerances and reading distances
Certain sizes are recommended for each code for the print of module widths.
Tolerances are also speciﬁed for each barcode which determine acceptable
deviations of the bar widths [33]. These tolerances are of importance at least
when barcode labels have to be printed with diﬀerent methods and they may
be a criterion in favour of or against a certain barcode.
The code 2/5 with a ratio of narrow bar to wide bar of 3:1 and a ratio of
narrow bar to separator of 2:1 has a tolerance of 20%. This is very high and
due to the fact that the spaces between the bars do not hold any information.
Thus, the code 2/5 is optimal for a simple print on matrix or ink-jet printers.

196
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
The code 2/5 interleaved has a considerably lower tolerance, which is
based on the ratio between the narrow and wide element v (between 2:1 and
3:1) and the chosen module width mb. Thus, the following applies to the
tolerance t of the code 2/5 interleaved: t = ±((18v −21)/80)mb [49].
In case of a ratio between the narrow and the wide element v = 3 and a
chosen module width mb = 0, 33mm the tolerance (rounded) is t = ±((18 ×
3 −21)/80) × 0, 33mm= 0, 136mm. Thus, in the code 2/5 interleaved and
at a ratio between narrow and wide elements of v = 3 : 1 the tolerance t
must not exceed one third of the module width. If the ratio valency sinks the
tolerance is automatically reduced as well. In case of a ratio of v = 2 it is
only 0, 062 mm.
Due to the low tolerance of the code 2/5 interleaved compared to the code
2/5, this code requires a higher printing quality and thus a more expensive
technology.
The acceptable tolerances are speciﬁed for each barcode symbology. Three
diﬀerent tolerances b, e and p are given for code 128 which depend on the
module width mb:
– b = ± 0,33mb the tolerance of bars and spaces,
– e = ± 0,2mb the tolerance of bar edges within a character and
– p = ± 0,2mb the tolerance between the ﬁrst bar of a character to the ﬁrst
bar of the following character [103].
This low tolerance is understandable because the code 128 is a multi-width
code with information-bearing spaces.
There are diﬀerent recommendations for the module widths of the single
codes. Values from 0.3 mm to 0.35 mm can be found, while the general
enlargement factor 1.0 of the barcode is 0.33 mm [49, 70, 103]. An enlargement
factor larger than 1.0 (about 1.35 or 1.5) improves the readability but requires
more space. The reading distance as maximum scanner distance which still
allows for a faultless scan depends on the scanner and the chosen enlargement
factor of the barcode. The reading distance is given by the manufacturer of the
barcode scanner either as maximum distance (e.g., 100 mm) or as scanning
range (e.g., 100 mm - 500 mm).
In practice, many errors12 are due to the non-observance of reading dis-
tances. Depending on the scanner the distance may be 0 mm (touch reader)
(cf. section 6.5.2) or several meters (stationary industrial scanner or camera
system, (cf. section 6.5.3). Light also plays an important role with regard to
the reading distance since not all barcode scanner have a light source of their
own (e.g., cameras). Furthermore, the correct print depends on the pitch and
the screw of the scanner with regard to the barcode as well as the print
contrast signal.
12 Here, errors mostly are the “NoReads”, i.e., unread scans.

6.3 Printing method and quality
197
6.3 Printing method and quality
To use the barcode for the artiﬁcial encoding of an object, it has to be gener-
ated and applied prior to the actual identiﬁcation. The most optimal method
for the respective application has to be chosen from the variety of printing
and labelling techniques.
6.3.1 Labelling techniques
In principle, all printing techniques are suitable which print barcodes on
the desired surface with an adequate quality and precision. There are two
diﬀerent labelling methods, the direct and the indirect labelling:
Table 6.4. Labelling techniques
Direct labelling
Indirect labelling
– Direct ink-jet print
– Direct laser labelling
– Engraving
– Pins
– Matrix print
– Ink-jet print
– Laser print
– Thermo transfer print
– Direct thermo print
– Photosetting / Oﬀset print
– Screen printing
In case of a direct labelling the barcode is directly printed on the object
without a separate carrier. Ink-jet printers are often used to label cardboard
boxes. Other materials (plastic, glass, metal) are best labelled with laser
printers or by mechanical engraving. The quality of the prints largely de-
pends on the materials used and is reliable only under unchanged conditions.
Despite of their poor quality direct labels have some advantages:
– Cost savings (no labels or applicators)
– Code generation can easily be automated
– Code is directly and inseparably applied to the object
– A variable code and encoding in plain writing is possible
– Ink labels can be removed from suitable surfaces and the objects can be
relabelled in automatic cycles
The second group of labelling techniques is used more often above all
in logistic systems, i.e., the indirect labelling. Here, at ﬁrst a label or code
applicator is printed, which is then attached to the object. This may also be
done later.

198
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
6.3.2 Quality requirements
The quality of the barcode print has to ensure the quick, unproblematic
and, above all, faultless scan of the code. Especially in highly automated
warehouses each unidentiﬁed object initiates a system error and, thus, high
costs. The main reason for wrong reads is the poor quality of the auto-ID
label. Because of the high conveying speed in automatic warehouses it is vital
to achieve a high initial scan rate, i.e., the code has to be identiﬁed already
by the ﬁrst scan line. Important quality criteria for the printing of barcodes
are [48, 51, 68, 100]:
– Contrast between bright and dark
– Dimensional accuracy of the print
– Contour sharpness
– Congruence of the black surfaces
– Resolution (for very small codes)
– UV resistance
– Scratch and smear resistance
– Water and solvent proved
Above all the contrast largely depends on the used source of light. A red
barcode on a white background, for example, cannot be read under a red
laser light (cf. section 6.5.1). The most tried and tested combination is black
on white [48].
6.3.3 Selection of the printing technique
The quality of the barcode is of great importance for the choice of a print-
ing technique although not the sole criterion. In case of doubt the decision
in favour of or against a certain technique is based on the purchasing and
operating costs. The following aspects have to be cleared before choosing a
printing technique:
– Availability of the data to be encoded in the long run or a little bit in
advance
– Changeability of the data contents
– Direct or indirect labelling (print on the object (book, packaging, work-
piece) or on a label)
– Required printing speed
– Media handled by the printer (e.g., form, thickness and structure of the
label)
– Barcode to be used
– Space available for the barcode
– Advanced quantitative determination of the needed labels
– Purchasing costs

– Estimated costs for consumables such as toner, ink or labels as well as for
maintenance and repair of the equipment.
In any case, special attention has to be given to the ecological acceptability
of the used printers and materials. In some cases, this aspect may be decisive
when label printing is outsourced to other companies. During operation labels
can be printed with diﬀerent techniques: While matrix, ink-jet and laser
printers are widely used in oﬃces industry mainly works with thermal direct
and above all thermal transfer printers. Here, the label is guided along a print
head where small ceramic elements can selectively be heated. At a thermal
direct print the heat initiates a chemical reaction on the labels which causes
colored spots on the label. This method requires thermo-sensitive labels.
In case of a thermal transfer print (cf. Fig. 6.14) a wax or resin-coated ink
ribbon runs between the print head and the label. The heat melts the ink
particles, which are then transferred to the label. The print need not be ﬁxed
and is immediately smear resistant.

200
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
Thermal direct printers are simple and highly compact systems (cf.
Fig. 6.15). Their advantage is the small quantity of consumables (special pa-
per) so that maintenance and operating costs can be kept low. The printers
are easy to operate, work at a medium speed and provide a good quality. La-
bels printed by a thermal direct printer are not too suitable for a long-term
use because the chemical reaction in the label may be reversed so that the
label would become sensitive to heat and UV rays.

Thermal transfer printers are more sensitive because of a more elaborate
mechanics and, thus, generally cause higher operating costs. The printing
costs remain constant since a ﬁxed length of ink ribbon is used for one label.
The costs for a 20% black print; however, (cf.Table 6.5) are lower than for a
laser print [68]. The prints are of high quality, smear, heat and UV resistant
as well as water, alcohol and fat proved.
The decision whether conventional laser-ink-jet or matrix printers should
be used instead of the relatively expensive thermal transfer printers can only
be made after all parameters have been taken into consideration. Special
attention has to be given to the requirements on the printing quality and the
durability of the print. If these requirements are high and if the print should
be resistant to all external impacts, a thermal transfer printer is a good
solution [68] while laser and matrix printers are good solutions for oﬃce and
industrial use.
6.4 Semantics in the code: EAN 128
While the code 128 can be used to encode data on a barcode level the code
EAN 128 is used for a cross-company communication. The barcode symbology
of the code 128 deﬁnes all technical basic characteristics of a code. However,
the organizational handling of the barcode is not determined so that the

6.4 Semantics in the code: EAN 128
201
deﬁnition of code 128 can be seen as basic layer of an encoding technique
which does not yet provide any rules regarding the future practical use. These
are provided by the code EAN 128.
Any warehouse operator is able to deﬁne objects which are necessary for
the warehouse operation, such as articles and their packaging as well as load
supports and storage bins for the logistic processes and to label them by
means of barcodes. Such labelling is indispensable for automatic identiﬁca-
tion. As long as the objects do not leave the in-house cycle, i.e., the company
premises, it is suﬃcient to label them with an internal code. This is best
done by a systematic approach, such as the redecoding or uniqueness of the
numbers.
However, for cross-company communication, a decoding method has to be
agreed upon to allow for a “common language”. Such an agreement is very
complex and has to be repeated every time a partner wants to join the com-
mercial or communication group. Another possibility is to use an industry-
wide standard such as the code EAN 128. In 1977 in Germany the CCG,
“Centrale f¨ur Coorganisation GmbH — Gesellschaft zur Rationalisierung des
Informationsaustausches zwischen Handel und Industrie” was founded. The
CCG represents the “International Article Numbering Association” (an um-
brella organisation located in Brussels). Both organizations focus on the fur-
ther development of the EAN systems which
“in the meantime has become a worldwide standard for identiﬁcation
techniques, or even better, the only standard for really international
applications” [12].
The EAN systems are based on three numbering or encoding systems,
the GLN (global location numbering), the EAN (international article num-
bering)13 and on the SSCC (aerial shipping container code). These three
encoding systems are included in the code EAN 128 which, on the other
hand, can also be represented in the barcode symbology of the code 128.
6.4.1 Global location numbering (GLN)
The GLN serves as physical address of companies and sections or depart-
ments. It is compatible to the GLN concept of EAN and applies worldwide.
A GLN is assigned just once and can be tracked down precisely.
The GLN is divided into type 1 and type 2, which are compatible. Global
location numbers of type 1 are used for the clear identiﬁcation of an orga-
nization, but not for the numbering of articles or unit loads. A type 1 GLN
consists of 2 digits and one check digit. In Germany this number is assigned
consecutively by the EAN commission, the CCG.
A GLN type 2 also consists of 13 digits (twelve digits and one check digit).
Here, the EAN authorities assign just a seven-digit basic number while the
13 Originally, the term EAN stood for European article numbering.

202
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
other ﬁve digits and the check digit are freely determined by the GLN user
and should not be used otherwise.
GLNs of this type are used to build continuous location numberings for
own sections such as production lines, warehouses, departments or other lo-
cations and as article numbers. Up to 100 000 company sections or locations
can be deﬁned with these digits.

The ﬁrst two or three digits (cf. Table 6.6) of the GLN are the country
code. This code should not indicate the country of origin of the product or
the location of the company but the country where the location number was
assigned. The general terms and conditions of EAN Austria stipulate, for ex-
ample: “Eligible are all companies which participate in the goods and services
traﬃc in Austria.”14 A company with headquarters outside the country may
have a GLN in this country but also in all other countries worldwide. The
GLN is a company code, but not a code of origin. Table 6.6 shows the codes
of diﬀerent countries.
A company has been assigned, for example, the GLN 40 12345. It has
oﬃces in Berlin, a warehouse in Bochum with 4800 storage bins and a pro-
duction site in Bremen. With the GLN the company can determine location
numbers for each of its three section. Since these numbers have to have ﬁve
digits corresponding zip codes may be used here, i.e., 10713 for the oﬃces in
Berlin, 44791 for the warehouse in Bochum and 28777 for the production site
in Bremen.
Together with the corresponding check digit the valid thirteen digit GLNs
thus would be 4012345107135, 4012345447910 and 4012345287776. It would
be wiser, however, to assign number ranges to the single locations, e.g., the
range from 40000 to 49999 for the warehouse in Bochum. Finally this range
should be reﬁned, e.g., by assigning the number 40000 to 44799 to the storage
14 cf.: http://www.ean.co.at

6.4 Semantics in the code: EAN 128
203
bins, the number 44800 to the goods receipt and 44801 to the master oﬃce,
etc. If a company has a GLN type 2, it may built systems of its own and
assign the ﬁve location numbers at discretion.
6.4.2 International article number (EAN)
The EAN guarantees for the clear international identiﬁcation of single arti-
cles. Consisting of machine readable barcodes, it sets the basis for automatic
scans at the point of sale (POS).
Each company with an international location numbering type 2 is able to
generate EANs of its own. For this purpose, the ﬁrst seven digits of the GLN
(type 2) build the basic number. Like in sub-locations the next ﬁve places
can be ﬁlled with own digits which correspond to 100 000 diﬀerent articles.
The last place is reserved for the check digit. The result is a correct thirteen
digit EAN. Should these 100 000 options not be enough, i.e., if a company
oﬀers more than 100 000 diﬀerent articles another GLN can be requested.
The GLN and the EAN are very much alike and can easily be mixed up.
According to the CCG, however, it can be derived from the context if a code
is a GLN or an EAN so that a confusion is very unlikely in practice.
One speciality is the EAN 8, an eight-digit EAN code which was developed
above all for small-volume goods and articles. Since these very short EANs
have a limited number range the existence of the related article has to be
proved to the corresponding EAN authority.
For example, a company has been assigned the GLN 40 12345 and has an
assortment of ﬁve articles, it can number these articles itself, e.g. 00001 for
the ﬁrst article, 00002 for the second, etc. Together with the check digit the
EANs would be 4012345000016, 4012345000023, etc. The purpose of a clas-
siﬁcation of articles into groups and a subsequent segmentation will not be
discussed here because experience has shown that so-called descriptive num-
ber ranges cause considerable problems at least when the system boundaries
are exceeded.
With regard to licence agreements, each company participating in the
EAN system is obliged to ensure a clear numbering and to block numbers for
a certain period of time if the related articles are no longer available. Thus
it is ensured that, for example, in a supermarket the master data totally
correspond to the articles.
6.4.3 Serial shipping container code (SSCC)
The basic number of a GLN serves as basis for the generation of SSCC.
The term shipping describes a logistic unit (cf section 2.1.2), i.e., physically
connected units, e.g., packages like pallets or cardboard boxes which cannot
be separated.
The recipient of a package, who may also be a sender (forwarder), can
continue to use the SSCC of the container as long as he does not break the

204
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
unit (the package). He may notify the next recipient about the shipment just
by mentioning the received SSCC.
The SSCC is an 18-digit numerical sequence with the following sections:
The ﬁrst digit is the reserve digit, generally the digit 3. In the USA and
Canada the UCC15 has used this reserve digit of the SSCC to describe the
type of shipping container (such as cardboard box, pallet, crate or parcel). In
a SSCC the digit 3 stands for an “undeﬁned shipping container”. However,
since the adjustment of both systems EAN and UCC on 1 January 2001,
the digits 0 to 9 can freely be used as reserve digits. The reserve digit is
directly followed by the basic GLN number of the sender so that the shipping
container can clearly be assigned to the shipper similar to the EAN16.
Then follows a continuous nine-digit number that is freely assigned by
the user and, if necessary, has to start with an adequate number of zeros.
According to the CCG this number should not be reused for a certain period
of time — one year is proposed — to ensure the uniqueness of the SSCCs.
If the nine digits are not enough, i.e., should more than one billion shipping
units be built within this period, another GLN can be requested at the EAN
authority to generate further SSCCs. The last digit in the SSCC is the check
digit which is built according to the code 2/5 from the right side with the
weighting factors 3, 1, 3, 1, ... and the reloaded module operations17.
For example, a company has been assigned the GLN 40 12345, the con-
tinuous number of the shipping container is 987654321 and the check digit
calculated according to the formula of code 2/5 is 5, together with the reserve
digit 3 the SSCC is: 3 40 12345 987654321 5.
Provided that the SSCC is correct, unique and well documented the ship-
ping container can be identiﬁed worldwide. Owing to the GLN basic number
and the standardization of EAN and UCC each shipping container can be
directly assigned to a company. This sets the basis for an open and world-
wide tracking and tracing of consignments, which in the past has been an
additional service but nowadays is an indispensable feature and simpliﬁed
considerably by SSCC.
6.4.4 Characteristics of the code EAN 128
The code EAN 128 can be generated by directly including <FNC1> in the
code 128 after the start symbol.
The code EAN 128 not only carries diﬀerent data like the SSCC, the GLN
or the EAN, but also a number of other types of information. This information
is combined by a number of qualifying data identiﬁers and can be represented
in the form of barcodes. A ﬁxed format of the data identiﬁer in relation to
15 United Code Council, an organization pursuing the same aims as the EAN.
16 Since 1st January 2001 the CCG also assigns 8-digit and 9-digit basic numbers
but an SSCC label must not exceed 18 digits.
17 The check digits for GLN and EAN are built by just the same method.

its contents ensures that diﬀerent data identiﬁers and the related contents
can be written one after the other. There are two-, three- and four-digit
data identiﬁers as well as data ﬁeld contents of ﬁxed and variable lengths.
In addition to numerical contents, some data ﬁelds may also contain alpha-
numerical data. When diﬀerent combined data ﬁelds are represented by the
same barcode, the ﬁelds with a ﬁxed length should be at the beginning while
data ﬁelds with a variable length which have to be separated by a <FNC1>
are placed at the end.

The data identiﬁers are described, among other places, in [12], where it is
deﬁned whether a data ﬁeld is variable or ﬁxed, how many digits are provided
for the identiﬁer, and how many for the contents. Since all data identiﬁers
are numerical, it makes sense to do without alpha-numerical symbols as far
as possible and develop adequate codes for these ﬁelds instead. With its
completely numerical character set, the code C of the code 128 can be used
throughout; this compression saves up to 50% of the space18 (cf. section 6.2.7).

as the space they require. The date in the identiﬁers 13 and 15 has to be
followed by a six-digit information. If no day is given 00 has to be entered.

6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
The data identiﬁer 99 is an example of a variable length and the following
information may consist of up to 30 digits (in code C up to 60 digits). If the
identiﬁer 99 is followed by another data identiﬁer the separator <FNC1>
has to be put at the end of the ﬁeld to mark the beginning of the next ﬁeld.
Therefore, the <FNC1> symbol must never be used as a text sign.
The data identiﬁer for the SSCC is 00 (cf. Table 6.7) and together with
the 18-digit SSCC it requires space for 20 digits. If, for example, a barcode of
the type EAN 128 should be generated with the SSCC 3 40 12345 987654321

Figure 6.17. Correctly generated NVE in the form of a barcode
The SSCC built according to Fig. 6.17 can be used and printed on a
transport label for direct application. Transport labels should just bear the
SSCC and no further information.
The reason for this becomes evident when looking at mixed pallets: The
data identiﬁer 02 deﬁnes the EAN of the included sales unit and the data
identiﬁer 37 the quantity of the included units19 as to determine the single
contents and quantities. Since, however, there is no regulated order of infor-
mation about sales units and quantities (e.g., a meta data identiﬁer which
includes the identiﬁers 02 and 37) this may lead to some misunderstand-
ings. A mixed pallet, for example, requires twice the identiﬁer for the EAN
and the quantity. In the age of electronic communication the contents and
the quantity related to a SSCC can be sent by fax or EDI (electronic data
interchange). New promising methods like, for example, AS2 (Applicability
Statement 2) by IBM or BPEL4WS (Business Process Execution Language
for Web Services) by IBM, Microsoft and BEA are used in ﬁrst applications.
19 According to Table 6.7 the identiﬁer 37 has a variable length. If it does not stand
at the end of a barcode its contents has to be separated from the next identiﬁer
with a <FNC1> separator.

modules and thus 99 module widths more than the most space saving repre-
sentation in code C. A numerical sequence with a module width of 0,33 mm
in code A has a width of 84,15 mm and in code C of 51,48 mm (cf. Fig. 6.19).
Common and widely used barcode scanners in the form of a handheld touch
reader with a scan width of 60 mm up to max. 80 mm would not be able to
read the unpacked form of code A or B.

6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
6.5 Scanner technology, devices, interfaces
The choice of a suitable barcode symbology for the use and generation of the
codes and the application on a object is just one problem to be solved. The
scanning, identiﬁcation and processing of the barcode is another which will
be studied in detail in this section. When a barcode is scanned the optical
image in the form of light and dark bars of diﬀerent widths has to be scanned,
digitized, identiﬁed and processed into mechanically readable data ﬂows. All
this is performed by a barcode scanner.
6.5.1 Barcode scanner
A scanner and a decoder are the basic parts of a reader. The scanner receives
the reﬂected signals of the bars and spaces of a barcode with a single photo
diode, an array of photo diodes, a photo transistor and a CCD (charge-
coupled-device).
For this purpose, the barcode has to be suﬃciently lighted and the pat-
terns have to have a suﬃcient print contrast signal. Older devices have to
have a print contrast signal of a least 70% to ensure a correct scan, newer
devices can be operated with half the signal. The print contrast signal dk can
be determined based on the reﬂection of the bars rs and the spaces rl with
the formula: dk = 100% × ((rl −rs)/rl). If, for example, the background of
a barcode has a reﬂection of 80% and the bar of 42% this results in a print
contrast signal of dk = 100% × ((80% −42%)/80%) = 47.5%. If a barcode
on such a medium should be readable for older devices the reﬂection of the
darker bar rs has to be (70% = 100% × ((80% −rl)/80%) ⇔rl = 24%)
and should be reduced to 24 percent. Generally, this is achieved by a darker
colour.
The light reﬂected by the barcode is digitalized by the scanner with a A/D
converter and transmitted to the decoder. In the past, scanner and decoder
were separate devices, but now they are built as a unit in the same casing.
The decoder decodes the transmitted digital data into the ASCII code and
provides the decoded numerical or character sequences.
Prior to studying the diﬀerent barcode readers, they are classiﬁed into
portable and stationary devices.
6.5.2 Handheld scanners
The ﬁrst barcode readers on the market were barcode pens that had to be
moved directly above a barcode at a continuous speed. These simple struc-
tured devices are still in use sometimes. A light ray bundled by a lens or a
laser diode is sent to a point at the light-sensitive end of the scanner (cf.
Fig. 6.20).
This end is moved along the barcode, which reﬂects the light more (light
surface) or less (dark surface). A photo diode converts the reﬂected light into

6.5 Scanner technology, devices, interfaces
209

a voltage. By smoothing the voltage edge (Schmitt trigger principle) and
levelling the time a digital signal can be generated and thus the bars, spaces
and their respective length can be interpreted.
More eﬃcient than code pens are CCD handheld scanners or scanners with
a mobile ray (cf. Fig. 6.21). The CCD handheld scanner, which are primarily
in the form of touch readers, contains an array of microscopic photo diodes
which can scan the barcode as a complete image. The barcode is lighted by
an LED line which emits red or infrared light. These user-friendly, light and
robust devices are ideal for order-picking terminals, cash points and manual
work places; however, the scanning range is limited by the CCD array is of
disadvantage.
The portable scanner with a mobile ray sends a light signal, which is
generated by a semi-conductor laser diode, via a mirror oscillating at 30 or
50 Hertz or a rotating polygon mirror onto the barcode. The reﬂection of
the lighted areas is recorded by photo detectors. This device is able to read
longer scan lines and thus longer barcodes but due to the required mechanics
it is larger. More comfortable devices dispose of processors with multi-line
mini-displays and block keyboards. Some of them oﬀer terminal functions or
the possibility to directly preprocess the data.
Handheld scanners generally have an RS232 interface. Some smaller hand-
held CCD scanners can even be plugged between the keyboard and the com-
puter. The barcode scanner then works transparently i.e., like a computer
keyboard.
6.5.3 Stationary scanners
In addition to handheld devices, stationary barcode readers are used . These
look and function like the handheld scanners. The only exception are the
camera systems that do not scan the code line by line but process the complete

210

image. A commonly used version is the POS scanner (point of sale), which is
integrated in shop counters and was developed to scan barcodes at consumer
goods.
Stationary scanners are used at conveyor lines for the identiﬁcation of
piece goods where conditions remain relatively unchanged to allow for an
automatic scan or where a manual scan is impossible for throughput reasons.
In front of shunts they collect data for transport decisions, behind the shunt
for control purposes.
A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the handheld scanners and stationary
barcode scanners is the data transfer method. While most of the handheld
scanners transmit the data via the keyboard port or RS232, many station-
ary industrial scanners are connected to a RS48 interface via various ﬁeld
bus systems. This allows for a data transmission over considerably longer
distances (cf. Chapter 5).
6.6 2D-Codes
In addition to ID-codes, simple linear (horizontal) barcodes or optical codes
are used to increase the information contents. These codes also use the 2nd

211
dimension, the “vertical” component for the transfer of information. In the
most simple case common barcodes are put one above the other, i.e., in
multiple lines. More complex methods reduce the bar to a dot and are thus
called matrix or dot codes.
The 1D-barcode is a reference to an information while the actual infor-
mation is transmitted by a 2D symbology with a higher information density.
6.6.1 Stacked barcodes
In 1987 the company Intermec was the ﬁrst to develop the stacked barcode of
the code 49 to be used in astronautics. With this code a maximum of 81 digits
or 49 alpha-numerical signs can be transmitted which are encoded in up to
eight lines. The basic idea was to better utilize the barcode space for data and
to minimize the redundancy of prolonged bars by a multi-line representation
of the codes. This clearly reduces the height of the single barcodes.
Figure 6.22. Example of a code 49
One year later German engineers started to develop another stacked bar-
code, the Codablock barcode.
In a Codablock a barcode line is continued
until the line is complete; then it is wrapped. In Codablock F, which is based
on the code 128, up to 44 lines with four to 62 characters each can be encoded,
that is a maximum total capacity of 2728 characters. Nowadays, Codablock
is widely used in health care, e.g., to mark blood bottles.
Figure 6.23. Example of a Codablock barcode
A widely used stacked barcode is the PDF 417 barcode (Portable Data
File). Each single character is encoded into a codeword with a width of 17
modules which consists of four diﬀerently wide bars and spaces. A maximum
of 90 lines with 2700 digits or 1850 ASCII characters can be stored.

212
6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
Figure 6.24. Example of a PDF 417
Of course, it requires another technology to read 2D codes, i.e., camera
systems and fan scanners in addition to line scanners.
6.6.2 Matrix codes
Only few of the many matrix codes are commonly used, such as:
– Aztec
– QR Code
– MaxiCode
– Data Matrix Code
– Dot Code A
In case of the Aztec code several nested squares in the middle of this
square code serve as search element20. 12 to 3000 characters can be encoded
and owing to an error correction the code can even be read when up to 25%
of the data surface are damaged.
Figure 6.25. Example of an Aztec code
The QR code (quick response code) consists of nested squares situated in
three corners which serve as a search element. This code is also square and
owing to an error correction the data can be reconstructed when up to 30%
of the data surface are damaged. The code was developed in Japan and can
store up to 1810 Japanese Kanji/Kana characters, 4296 ASCII characters or
about 7000 digits.
For the shipment of parcels the MaxiCode is used where 93 ASCII
characters or 138 digits are encoded on a ﬁxed surface of one square inch
(25,4mm×25,4 mm). The Max Code has a search pattern consisting of three

concentric circles around which 866 hexagons are arranged in 33 lines which
are ﬁlled in black or white. Owing to the MaxiCode error correction data
damaged up to 25 percent can be reconstructed.
Next, there is the Data Matrix Code, version ECC 200 , which was de-
veloped in the USA in the late 1980s. Up to 1558 ASCII characters or 3116
digits can be encoded on a square surface of a variable size.
Figure 6.27. Example of a Data Matrix Code
The search element of the Data Matrix Code is a horizontal bar at the
lower end and a vertical at the left side. The alternating black and white
pattern at the left and the upper side deﬁnes the size of the symbol and thus
of the data contents. The Data Matrix Code is mainly used in the electronic
industry to label conductor boards and and chips as well as in the automotive
industry and as digital postage stamp.
Figure 6.28. Example of a dot code A
The Dot Code A consists of a square of 6 × 6 up to 12 × 12 dots. Up to
42 billion objects can be encoded with this code which is used, for example,
to identify laboratory tubes, to label linen in laundries, but also to process
aluminium slugs with stamped dot codes [50].
Last but not least, there are the so-called 3D codes, which are based on
the 2D codes and use colored components as a third dimension.

6. Automatic Identiﬁcation
6.7 Radio frequency identiﬁcation
The introduction of automatic identiﬁcation technologies supported or even
allowed for the tracking and tracing in many logistic applications. Of all
available technologies barcode systems are the most commonly used, owing to
their simple structure, good standards and low costs. But the radio frequency
identiﬁcation (RFID) is becoming more and more important.
This section deals with the RFID technology and its use in logistics. In
ﬁelds where barcodes are used RFID systems oﬀer additional features and
open up a variety of new ﬁelds of application. This study from the techni-
cal and organizational point of view is followed by an comparison between
barcode and RFID.
6.7.1 Functioning and technical structure
RFID is a technique for the contact-free recording and transmission of binary
encoded information by means of electromagnetic waves. Information are
transmitted between an information tag21 applied to the goods and a mobile
or stationary scanner. RFID systems are divided into two main function
groups:
– Transponders22 as information carriers on the goods to be identiﬁed. The
information stored on the transponders are just readable or rewritable,
according to the type.
– A device for the recording of transponder information. Depending on the
transponder type either readers or writers/readers can be used.
Since the data are transmitted via radio transmission, no intervisibility is
required between the transponder and the scanner during the transmission.
All types of transponders are equipped with an antenna for the data
transmission, a transmitter to couple antenna signals23 as well as a micro-
controller (µC) to control the data in the memory. Controller and memory
often are integrated in one chip (cf. Fig. 6.29).
The active data received by a write/read device can be transmitted via a
serial interface (RS232, RS485) to a computer for further processing.
RFID systems are available in a variety of forms (cf. Fig. 6.30). Basic
diﬀerences exist with regard to the power supply, the memory technology
and the frequency ranges used for data transmission.
21 The most commonly used term for RFID carriers is transponder, but terms like
mobile data store (MDS) and tag are also used.
22 The term is combined of transmit and respond.

data.

Power supply The power supply mainly aﬀects the size, lifetime and ap-
plication range of a transponder. Transponders, thus, are divided into two
basic categories:
Passive transponders are powered by a magnetic ﬁeld generated by the
scanner. As long as a transponder is within the range of the scanner the
externally radiated alternating ﬁeld generates a voltage in the antenna
coil. The power is transmitted according to the transformer principle but
only over short distances.
Active transponders are equipped with a battery (ﬂat or coin cell) for the
chip and can independently initiate a data transmission. Owing to the
internal power supply, the performance is large enough also for long-
distance data transmission.
In a certain kind of active transponders the battery is used only to buﬀer the
data memory. The required power for the transmission and reception is —
like in passive systems - generated by the alternating ﬁeld.
Memory types The data memories of transponders have a capacity of one
bit24 up to 128 Kb. Read-only memories contain ﬁxed actual data already
24 1-Bit transponders for the electrical article securing (EAS), e.g., in the textile
industry.

determined by the manufacturer. The buﬀering of data needs no electricity
because a ROM25 is used and the access speed is relatively low. Therefore,
they are used for the storage of small data quantities (e.g., article numbers)
with a typical capacity of some hundred bits. Write-once memories contain
similar technical data and are used for the same purposes but can be written
once by the user (OTP-ROM26). In Read-/Write memories RAMs27 are used
which allow for a quicker access and have a larger capacity but require a
battery buﬀer.
Data transmission, frequency ranges and coverage
The design of a
transponder antenna depends on whether it is a wire coil, a print coil28 or
a dipole (for microwave transmission). If a transponder is located within a
transmission ﬁeld, the chip is activated and in case of read-only transponders
the stored active data are transmitted.
In passive systems the data are transmitted in two phases: During the
ﬁrst phase the ﬁeld energy is used to charge a memory condensator, which in
the second phase activates the chip and thus the data transmission. This pro-
cedure is continued until the transponder is no longer activated by the trans-

mission ﬁeld. In case of active systems the ﬁrst phase is omitted so that the
response time may be shorter. Rewritable transponders require a protocol-
based transmission where either the reading or writing of the transponder is
initiated by the transmitter by means of a corresponding telegram. . Princi-
pally, higher transmission frequencies allow for a larger coverage and thus for
higher transmission speeds (Table 6.8).
The achievable transmission rates and coverage depend on the physical envi-
ronmental conditions29 and are furthermore deﬁned by corresponding stan-
dards and regulations.
Allowed frequency ranges and transmission rates for transponders in Ger-
many and Europe are stipulated by corresponding regulations30 as not to
interfere with other radio services (mobile telephony, broadcast) [97].
In the USA, South Africa and Asia further frequency ranges are allowed so
that passive transponders and microwave transmission can be used worldwide
(cf Fig. 6.31).
Multiple access A promising application of RFID systems is the simultane-
ous recording of many transponders and thus of tagged objects. This multiple
access also known as bulk scan is already supported by the radio technology
since all transponders within the sphere of a scanner can send and receive data
at the same time. While during a broadcast from the scanner all transponders
simultaneously receive a data request, the response telegrams of the single
transponders have to be recorded and processed collision-free by the scanner
by means of adequate procedures.
Using access methods known from radio technology, one can distribute
the capacity of one transmission channel to several participants (multiplex
operation). However, this can only be used in case of a continuous radio
transmission. Passive read-only RFID transponders with little data volumes
transmit for short, discontinued periods of time and with long breaks. In
29 Metals or liquids in the sphere reduce the strength of the radio signals emitted
by an RFID system.

such cases, multiplex methods cannot be used or only to a limited extent.
Anti-collision methods are used instead which optionally are transponder or
scanner-controlled:
ALOHA: This simplest transponder-controlled method makes use of the
diﬀerences between the repeat times of transponders. Since the transmis-
sion time of a telegram is much shorter than the repeat time until the
next telegram and since all transponders with a deﬁned possibility send
at diﬀerent times the collision rate and thus the average time required
for the reading of all transponders can be estimated31.
Slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA): Is an optimization of the above-mentioned
method by a synchronized data transmission where the transmitter deter-
mines time slots for all transponders by means of a broadcast telegram.
Dynamical S-ALOHA: In this method the number of slots initiated per
time unit can be varied to increase the reliability of the scan.
There are further methods as well as error recognition techniques.
In ad-
dition to this, safety mechanisms have to be considered in certain ﬁelds of
application which can be used to encode the transmitted data [1, 10].
31 Finkenzeller sets 800 ms as an average time for the reading of eight passive
transponders. To ensure a reading reliability of 99.9% about 2.7 s would be
required.

6.7.2 Fields of application
Tagged transport packaging opens up all ﬁelds of application for barcode sys-
tems. Furthermore, the direct automatic scanning and booking, for example,
during a bulk scan, allow for the consistent tracking and tracing along the
complete supply chain without manual interference.
General use in logistics The tagging of goods and packaging in the con-
sumer goods industry with transponders oﬀers a large potential for the opti-
mization of the supply chain. But because of lacking standards and relatively
high costs this method is only used in special cases or for high-quality goods.32
Principally, transponders can be used in all areas of automatic identiﬁca-
tion, control and partially for the recording of measuring data33 This method
is ideal for reusable packaging, such as containers, crates, barrels, etc. Since
transponders manage the product-speciﬁc information as well as information
about the owner, times of use and cycles.
They can further be used to protect the originality of products (forge-
proof) and to ensure the consistent traceability along the production and
supply chain.
RFID in commerce — ePC The Electronic Product Code (ePC) was de-
veloped in 1999 by a cooperation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) and diﬀerent American trading companies with the aim to standardize
and propagate the ePC. The resulting code standard provides a data space
for transponders of 96 bits by which about 7, 9 ·1028 unique article codes can
be assigned. Transponder costs should be minimized by means of the small
memory. Instead of storing the article data and data histories locally the code
serves as a key by which the article-related data can be retrieved from the
Internet.
The ePC is implemented on transponders physically in the microwave
or UHF range. On request each code is assigned to a storage location for
the article data by means of object name services34 (ONS). A standardized
semantics is ensured by the physical markup language (PML).
Since all information is highly decentralized, all data ﬂows in the Inter-
net are controlled by so-called savants35. These distributed software systems
collect, count and ﬁlter all transponder numbers arriving in the network, or-
ganize the data update between the distributed systems and oﬀer interfaces
for the local connection of a scanner [27].

carriers).

food along the cold chain.

7. Information and Communication
Technology
This chapter deals with the basics of information and communication tech-
nology with the aim to give a better understanding of general principles
and their practical implementation – as far as they are relevant for decisions
about the choice, procurement and operation of a WMS. Since the informa-
tion and communication technology is subject to rapid changes this chapter
just gives a basic overview and describes concrete procedures by means of
chosen examples.
7.1 Communication technology
Modern communication technology is the key to a quick and faultless data ex-
change and to various services oﬀered in public networks [76] [77]. The era of
electronic communication started when the ﬁrst Morse telegraphs were sent.
These were soon followed by telephone, telefax and television as well as mod-
ern digital technologies. The transmission techniques have also changed a lot.
While at the beginning only wired point-to-point connections without relays
were possible these were followed by switched connections1, packet switch-
ing2 and broadband technology3. Furthermore, the multiple use of media by
means of the multiplex technology, the optical transmission and satellite tech-
nology opened up new possibilities. Today, a variety of services are oﬀered
for diﬀerent transmission media.
The following sections give a short overview over the many terms and
abbreviations related to communication technology.
1 The switching technology where a line is switched for the time of a connection
is called line connection.
2 The data to be transmitted are combined into small units, packets. Each of these
packets is transported individually through the network instead of sending the
complete data over a ﬁxed line.
3 The same frequency band in a transmission channel is used simultaneously for
several data transmissions.

7.1.1 Layered architectures
Layered architectures represent just one software structure. In communica-
tion technology this principle is used with great success. A layer provides
services for the superordinate layer using the services oﬀered by its subordi-
nate layer (cf. Fig. 7.1).

Figure 7.1. Basic principle of a layer in a software system
This and the following sections describe the ISO/OSI reference model
(cf. Fig. 7.2) which is widely used and recognized in the communication tech-
nology. With the ISO/OSI model the communication via electronic media
can be represented in seven hierarchical layers, which represent the informa-
tion ﬂow from the physical medium to the application (at the example of a
WMS). Applications are connected with each other via the layer sequence
6 →5 →4 →3 →2 →1 →transmitter →1 →2 →3 →4 →5 →6.
Since on the receiving side the layers are passed in reversed order it is also
called a protocol stack. Table 7.1 shows the tasks of the single layers. The
layers 1 to 4 are considered as transport-oriented layers while the layers 5 to
7 are application-oriented. A detailed description can be found, for example,
in [77].
7.1.2 Protocols
Protocols implement the functions on a layer. Each single layer receives the
active data to be transmitted from its superordinate layer. Together with

the header, which contains information about the transmitted data, these
data are combined into a frame or packet4 and transferred to the next layer.
During this procedure larger packets can be split up into several smaller
ones or combined into larger packets. On the receiving side, the headers
generated on the diﬀerent layers are separated from the active data so that
the application only gets the data sent by the sending application.
Received packets are in most cases accepted or rejected by acknowledg-
ment packets which, by means of checksum calculations and evaluation pro-
tocols, identify transmission errors and can request the corresponding layer
to resend the packet. For a detailed description of general protocol principles
please refer, for example, to [35, 77]. Typical protocols used in the Internet
are shown in Fig. 7.3:
– Internet protocols
– FTP (ﬁle transfer protocol) for the secure transmission of ﬁles
– TELNET (remote terminal program) for a character-based communica-
tion with system and application programs
– SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) for the transmission of emails
– NSP (name server protocol) for the breakup of names in the Internet
– SNMP (simple network management protocol) for network management
– Transport protocols
– TCP (transmission control protocol) for the connection-oriented commu-
nication. A client process (cf. section 7.1.6) connects to a server process.
This connection can be used for communication in both directions until
it is terminated by one of the users.
4 Frames and packets always include a header and active data. The term “frame”
is mainly used for the layers one and two.

Net-

The packets which are not destined for this computer are
transferred to another computer. This networking may include
several computers and is called routing. The computers which
use this layer only as node between neighbouring computers
and do not transfer received packets to a higher protocol layer
are called routers (cf. Fig. 7.11).

Securing of the correct data transmission. The correctness is
also checked on the higher layers but this layer is the ﬁrst one
with a direct connection to the hardware where a high error
rate has to be expected depending on the used transmission
medium and the access procedure as well as the current er-
ror situation. The smallest unit of transmitted data is called
frame.
This layer is divided into two sub-layers, the medium access
control (MAC layer: MAC regulates the access to the medium.
It deals, for example, with collisions in bus systems (cf. Chap-
ter 5). The LLC layer (LLC: Logical Link Control) is responsi-
ble for the secure data transmission. Check sums are added to
the frames; acknowledgement frames acknowledge the correct
reception of frames.

7.1.3 Transmission media
The transmission media are the bottom layer of a communication system.
Despite of their analogous physical functioning they are used for the trans-
mission of digital signals – i.e., signals with a ﬁnite countable set of symbols.
On the higher layers only digital signals with two status – binary signals –
are used. The electric cable, for example, can be charged at the same time
with diﬀerent voltages. The higher the possible voltage the more critical the
assignment of a concrete variable to a symbol under real conditions. Under
real conditions the voltages are always subject to ﬂuctuations caused by the
characteristics of the transmission medium and external interferences. For
this reason the quantity of information to be sent at a certain time depends

on the interferences and the quality of the medium. Many modems5 which
are used for a data transmission via telephone lines adjust automatically to
the current transmission quality.
The transmission of voltages is just one way to transmit information to
a medium. Alternatively, they can be transmitted by sounds, sound modula-
tions but also by combined methods6.
With optical ﬁbres (also called glass ﬁbres) signals can be transmitted
nearly error-free. They cover a large band width and are insensitive to electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. Optical ﬁbres are more and more used in all industrial net-
works. Figure 7.4 shows the basic structure of a data transmission from the
source to the sink. The source code packs the data ﬂow. The methods de-

quadrature modulation) are described in [42].

pend on the kind of data source. Digital images and audio ﬁles, for example,
are encoded by other methods that text ﬁles. To better utilize the trans-
mission channel several data ﬂows may use the same transmission medium.
This technique is called multiplexing, the corresponding devices are multi-
plexers/demultiplexers (MUX/DEMUX). The channel encoder optimizes the
bundled signals according to the characteristics of the transmission channel
[42]. Adaptive methods work dynamically and consider the current interfer-
ences. When the interferences acting on the transmission channel increase
the transmission speed is reduced. The modulator converts the signals into
physical values (electrical/optical) which are then sent through the channel
to the destination. This basic diagram does not show the bi-directional use of
the channel but just point-to-point connections: Each data source is assigned
to just one data sink. Section 7.1.4 shows other possible network structures
and connections.
Another important factor is the transmission speed. The number of ﬁgure-
shift signals per second is described by the unit baud and is restricted by the
characteristics of the medium (bandwidth). For the user the transmission rate
in bits per second is more important since this value has a direct eﬀect on
the transmission time required for a given data volume.
When longer cables are used the signal lapse is slurred and the signal
strength is reduced. For this reason, repeaters (cf. section 7.1.4) are used to
restore and increase the signals.
In addition to the electrical transmission media described in this chap-
ter also optical media are used which function independently of external
electromagnetic ﬁelds and emit no such ﬁelds themselves, i.e., have a high
electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC). They can be laid together with other
cables without causing any problems.
Special attention has to be given to radio transmission. Above all shading,
large signal ﬂuctuations at the destination and multiple input due to reﬂec-
tions complicate the technical implementation of this technology. Especially
in warehouses with a lot of steel elements, the use of radio transmission has
to be planned and set up carefully and often requires extensive measurements
and, if necessary, additional transmitters and antennas.
7.1.4 Network types and internetworking
Networks can be categorized into bus, loop, double loop, hub-and-spoke, grid
or complete systems according to their structure (cf. Fig. 7.5). With the ex-
ception of the bus structure the topologies are based on the point-to-point
connection. In bus systems the communication between the users is some-
what diﬃcult because data can be transmitted by just one user at a time. In
Chap. 5 some methods (medium access methods) are described by which this
problem can be solved. Similar problems occur in radio and infrared systems
where several users share one medium. Because of the mobility of the users

From the ﬁeld bus to long-distance traﬃc
Networks are used in all
industrial sectors. They are classiﬁed according to the length of the transmis-
sion line between two communication partners7. The error rate and latency
increase in line with the distance. The networks are categorized as follows
according to the typical distance between the single front-end computers:
– In automation equipment ﬁeld bus systems (cf. Chapter 5) support the
quick exchange of signals and measured values between transmitters and
controls as well as between controls and actuators. The call for a short
latency may range from a very short to a guaranteed maximum latency.
The realtime behavior of the overall system has to be ensured also in the
relatively slow conveying processes.
– Local Area Networks (LANs) are mainly used within buildings and achieve
a high throughput at a short latency.
7 This also applies to the distance between to front-end computers by which the
data packets are transmitted to the target computer.

– Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are typically used for “medium” dis-
tances
– wide area networks (WANs) are used to bridge large distances – e.g., be-
tween cities, countries or continents.
Fig. 7.6 shows the qualitative classiﬁcation of a network. Based on these
networks and their characteristic features large networks – so-called Internet
networks [77] – can be built. A typical example of this is the Internet. Its
main connection lines, where large data volumes are transmitted over long
distances, are called backbones (cf. Fig. 7.7).

have to be bridged and diﬀerent networks have to be connected. The routing
in such networks requires adequate, cross-network switching facilities. Sub-
networks can be connected on the diﬀerent levels of a layered system.
– Repeaters belong to the ISO/OSI layer 1 and regenerate electrical signals.
They are used to bridge larger distances.
– Hubs also belong to layer 1 and are mainly used to reduce the cabling.
They connect several segments each of which is a bus system of its own.
A hub copies all incoming frames of each segment into all other segments.
Thus the network has the topology of a hub-and-spoke system but behaves
like a bus system (cf. Chapter 5).
– Switches are used to avoid the collision of the frames of diﬀerent segments.
Switches are structured like a hub but copy the received packet just into
the segment connected to the receiver (also called switching hubs).
– Many companies operate several LANs which have to be connected. For this
purpose bridges are used. Compared to a router which operates on layer 2
it requires less expenditure. Bridges can connect networks with diﬀerent
technologies – or better with diﬀerent medium access protocols. The target
address of the switching layer is not decoded for this purpose.
– Routers transmit the data packets in layer 3 via “favourable” paths.
– A gateway operates on the application layer and has to pass all subordinate
layers of the protocol stack. Gateways are used to connect diﬀerent appli-
cations or diﬀerent subordinate protocol layers where a transition between
diﬀerent networks is possible only on this level. Gateways are often used
to couple WMS and ERP systems to allow for a communication between
these systems despite of their diﬀerent application protocols.
7.1.5 Network addresses
Each layer of the ISO/OSI protocol stack operates with clear identiﬁcations
which are called function code, session ID, service ID, node address or hard-
ware address, depending on the layer. The addressing is described by a simple
example8:
8 The example is based on a TCP/IP protocol and an Ethernet bus system.

pling of diﬀerent applications
On layer 1 the physical connections are deﬁnitely identiﬁable and labeled
units. Ethernet connections are typically labeled with eth=, eth1, etc. while
RS232 connections are often labeled with com1 and com29
The addresses in layer 2 are called MAC addresses. They are indispensable
in bus systems for a clear user identiﬁcation. The Ethernet operates with a
worldwide deﬁned 48-bit address which is assigned to a network card by the
provider.
The addresses in layer 3 – the network layer – are similar to telephone
numbers. Each user needs a clear ID independent of the technology and
the protocols of layers 1 and 2. Figure 7.12 shows the often used IP address
scheme ipv4 with a 32-bit address10. To improve the readability the addresses
are represented by four numbers separated by dots — each in the range of 0 to
255 — and are assigned by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
The addresses

play a special role since they cannot be managed centrally. They can be used
in networks without Internet access. Addresses beginning with the bit pattern
“1110” are used for so-called multicast addresses which are reserved for group
communication (one sender – many recipients) [77]. The classiﬁcation is very
9 Under Unix operating systems and under Linux the serial interfaces are labeled
with 66yS0 and ttyS1.
10 Here, only the ipv4 will be described which with 216 possible addresses is much
too small for a worldwide use. For this reason procedures have been developed
for the dynamical assignment of IP addresses. Currently, the ipv4 is changed to
ipv6 with 2128 possible addresses.

rigid and networks of the classes A 224, B 216, and C 28 can include users.
By means of a so-called network mask by which partial areas of the address
can be marked, this address scheme can be adjusted to better meet the daily
requirements.
Layer 4 uses an ID deﬁned for each user or computer node. Under TCP
(transport control protocol) this is called a port.
Layer 5 uses a session ID for the time of the connection by which the
user can be identiﬁed. Layer 6 identiﬁes the data types via corresponding IDs
and layer 7 can use function codes or object IDs as deﬁned ID depending on
the used application.
7.1.6 Examples
Client-server model
Networks can be used to provide services to other
users. Such a provider is called server, the user is called client11. A ﬁle server,
for example, gives access to a ﬁle system. These services can be used by several
clients concurrently. Such an architecture has to be able to deal with diﬀerent
kinds of errors. For example, the server, one of the clients or the network may
break down in diﬀerent system stati [77]. A process may be server and client
at the same time when it uses the services of another server to provide its
services.
WMSs often use the client-server principle to manage, for example, de-
centralized workstations. The inventory data are stored centrally on a server
while warehouse-speciﬁc applications run on the client using local capacities.
Examples of such a system are identiﬁcation stations at the I-point, order
11 The client-server principle is universal and bound to a network. A server can
also be implemented on a single computer in the form of processes while other
processes represent the client.

233
management for the entry and control of retrievals and mobile terminals in
the order-picking area which work with stationary or local client programs.
Time synchronization at the example of NTP In a WMS which con-
sists of several computers and/or is coupled online to other systems the con-
sistency of the system can only be ensured by use of a time protocol (cf.
section 7.4.2). The NTP (network time protocol) is one possibility to syn-
chronize the clocks in diﬀerent networks. Basically, the average value is built
and a distributed algorithm is used which runs on diﬀerent computers.
Name service DNS The DNS (domain name service) is an Internet service
designed for assigning hierarchically structured identiﬁers to a number of
characteristics [77].
The hierarchy is speciﬁed by dots which are separated by a sequence of
identiﬁers where the rightmost represents the highest level – the so-called top
level domain. The name can be reﬁned by adding one dot and one identiﬁer
at the left. The part of the identiﬁer to the right of the dot is called “domain”,
the part left of the separator is called a “name”, which has to be unique only
within its domain.
The most important application is the assignment of an IP address to
an identiﬁer. Thus it is possible to specify a computer in the Internet by a
“talking name” instead of the numerical IP address which often is diﬃcult
to memorize. Furthermore, the numerical address may change during a reor-
ganization while the name remains the same. Aliases referring to the same
computer can also be used12. The DNS can further be used, for example, to
assign computers to mail servers or to display the computer in plain writing.
In the Internet DNS is a distributed data base. The characteristics of an
identiﬁer – for example the assigned IP-addresses – are decoded by a name
server, which is permanently informed about the status of all computers in
its domain. To decode external addresses the name server uses the services of
other name servers and stores these information for a certain period of time
to reduce the data traﬃc.
URL The requirement for a standardized addressing scheme is met by the
URL (universal resource locator)13. The hierarchical name space of a URL
is built by combining several name spaces. The ﬁrst is the protocol identiﬁer
which is terminated by a colon. The speciﬁed protocol, on the one hand, de-
termines the used application protocol and, on the other hand, the further
structure of the URL. This often begins with a slash when ﬁle names are spec-
iﬁed and with a double slash for computers. Computers can be speciﬁed op-
tionally by their name (cf. section 7.1.6) or their IP address (cf. section 7.1.5).
12 www.mywms.de and www.mywms.com refer to the same IP address.
13 The term URI (Universal resource identiﬁer) is used synonymously but is not as
widely used [99].

WWW The WWW (World Wide Web) is an Internet service, which was
developed in 1989 by CERN in Geneva with the aim to standardize the repre-
sentation and connection of documents. Meanwhile, the WWW has become
the most popular Internet provider and the Internet is colloquially called
WWW or just the Web. The service functions according to the client-server
principle where the server manages the documents which are connected via
URLs or so-called links. A link may refer to parts of the documents in which
it is deﬁned or as external link to other documents stored on external com-
puters. The documents are stored and transmitted in a logic format in the
hypertext markup language (HTML). The exact type of representation is de-
termined by the client. The representation tool for HTML documents, the
browser, adapts the received documents to the user requirements by means
of local settings. These requirements are, for example, font size, color or page
dimensions but also security settings like the linking of received documents
to applications. The documents are transmitted in form of a simple protocol
in plain writing14, the HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).
Documents are not limited to plain text but also appear in a variety of
other forms like multimedia documents or application-speciﬁc documents,
e.g., drawings or article master data.
Documents are speciﬁed by their mime types (multipurpose Internet mail
extensions) [77], which originally were developed for emails (cf. Table 7.3).
In WMS HTML is more and more used for user interfaces because owing to
the standardized communication the terminals just need a suitable browser.
14 Plain writing means that only printable characters are transmitted.

Release of resources
This network technology oﬀers the possibility to
provide local devices, directories and ﬁles on the net to be used by other
users. Advantages of this multiple-client system are cost savings and the use
of central services like the centralized backup of a ﬁle server.
7.2 Data management
The data management is an important aspect of the warehouse manage-
ment. In addition to the article and inventory data – the basic data of a
warehouse management system – quite a number of other data have to be
managed. These data are diﬀerentiated according to their dynamics. Statical
data, which can be changed during operation, are, for example, the number
and dimensions of the storage bins15. Data with little dynamics are article
master data because they are only generated when new articles are entered
and changed when the article characteristics are changed. Highly dynamical
data are, for example, order and inventory data because they change with
every movement in the warehouse (cf. section 2.4).
The following sections focus on the safe and permanent storage, the co-
herence of all data in a system, the quick access and ﬁling of data. They
also deal with the relational database which nowadays is the most common
standard for the data management in complex systems.
7.2.1 Principles
The following principles and deﬁnitions are independent of the type of data
management.
15 Some systems allow for such changes during operation but the securing of the
system integrity may be very costly.

236
7. Information and Communication Technology
Persisting
The permanent storage of data independent of the method is
called persisting. Programs store their data during the runtime so that they
will not get lost in case of short circuits, hardware defects or program er-
rors. Sometimes it is necessary to cancel a running system for maintenance
purposes and to restart it later on. In such cases the data have to be stored
permanently, i.e., they have to be persisted.
Referential integrity Data must not be deleted when they are still used
by other parts of the program (referenced). This referential integrity ensures,
for example, that article master data in a WMS are deleted when there still
are corresponding articles in the warehouse or announced by the supplier.
Transactions
During the data processing temporarily inconsistent states
occur from time to time. When, for example, a new pallet enters the system
the data have to be stored, the pallet counter has to be incremented and a
location bin has to be reserved. Since the program ﬂow is sequential this leads
to temporary inconsistent states. This problem can be solved by transactions
which “clip” such operations. Each state before a transaction is consistent
as is each state after a transaction. Transaction systems oﬀer the possibility
of a rollback to cancel a transaction and to return to the former state. A
rollback deletes all changes performed during the transaction. The opposite
– the successful conclusion of a transaction – is started by a commit so that
the changed data are stored persistently and the system returns to a new
consistent state.
Access and blocking mechanisms
The concurrent use of data and
the transaction concept require access mechanisms which dependent on the
planned operations. A blocking may refer to just the read data or to com-
plete ﬁles as well as to database tables or only to parts thereof. Some data
management systems oﬀer the option to read also blocked data. A user of
this dirty read principle has to bear in mind that these data may be changed
concurrently. This type of access is used, for example, for inquiries.
Trigger Changes of data sets often initiate further actions. The basic prin-
ciple that a status change becomes an event is called trigger – in this concrete
case a data trigger. In a WMS the change of an article feature leads to an
update of other data. These facts can be encoded in the program functions
but data triggers always ensure that these changes are made and prevents
potential programming errors.
Journaling The persistent storage of large data sets is very time-consuming
and in some cases it may be better to save the operations instead of the data
after a data set has been changed. This principle is called journaling and is

7.2 Data management
237
widely used – also for data storage. Transactions and “undo functions” are
mostly performed by journaling. Starting from an initial status all changes
are stored in a so-called journal ﬁle. After a system breakdown the current
status16 can be restored by means of the operations stored in the journal ﬁle.
In journaling the persisting thus only refers to status changes and not to the
status itself. To keep the journal ﬁle small the current system status has to
be persisted from time to time and the journal ﬁles have to be deleted.
Filing
In contrast to the persisting data ﬁling is used to save data for a
long term. It is important for the future evaluation of data and above all for
the preparation of reports and other oﬄine evaluations. There may even be
regulations for the ﬁling of data or they have to be ﬁled for quality assurance,
e.g., the ﬁling of delivery notes and inventory data.
7.2.2 File systems
Each operating system oﬀers the option of a persistent data storage17 in the
form of a ﬁle system. Files are referenced by names which generally are hier-
archical. This hierarchy is represented by Directories. A ﬁle can be referenced
by an absolute or a relative path. Each hierarchy begins with a root and ends
at a ﬁle. The root of a ﬁle system can start with the memory of the ﬁle sys-
tem or with a logical identiﬁer(UNIX: “/”, WINDOWS: “a:, b:, c:, d:, etc.”).
Special characters are often allowed but are interpreted diﬀerently by some
systems. These aspects have to be considered especially in distributed and
portable WMS. Here, special characters and blanks should be avoided and
all ﬁle names should be written in lower cases. Recommendations have been
established for portable ﬁle identiﬁers.
The logical structure of a ﬁle determines how certain data sets can be
selected:
– Sequence access: The data sets of a ﬁle can be read and written only se-
quentially. This kind of ﬁle organization is used, for example, to write time
series for statistical evaluations. Because of their physical structure tape
machines support just this kind of access.
– Index sequence access method (ISAM): Each data set can be selected by
means of a key. Then data can be accessed sequentially from this position.
In the past ISAM ﬁles were often used in warehouse management systems.
Today, this access method is used by databases and thus is hidden from
other applications.
16 Open transactions are not carried out during the restorage so that after a sys-
tem breakdown, it has always to be checked if the last operations have been
performed.
17 So-called RAM disks in the central memory of a computer represent a volatile ﬁle
system and is of use when an application requires the functions of a ﬁle system
except the persisting. Because of the short access time, RAM-disks are ideal for
tests. Generally, they are not used in WMS.

– Random access: Each data set can be selected by means of an integer num-
ber. Thus, an application can access any ﬁles by a so-called key transfor-
mation. In the past, data sets related to the bin locations were selected by
a random access. Present systems mainly use a database for this purpose.
The access on ﬁles is controlled by a safety mechanism which in most
cases consists of a correction system for the owner, the group members and
other users.
By encoding the data content it can be further protected against misuse
– should they be meddled with.
7.2.3 Databases
Today the term database generally describes a relational database (RDBS:
Relational Database System) the basic principle of which is described in the
following section. The tasks of a database are:
– to store data persistently
– to ensure the integrity of the data
– to give access to data sets
– to link data sets
– to save, change and delete data sets

7.2 Data management
239
In addition to this they meet the general data management requirements
described in section 7.2.1. Chapter 9 gives an example of a WMS based on a
relational database.
The real or imaginary elementary data sets managed in a database
(records, tuple) are called entities. The structure of the data set is deter-
mined by attributes with the corresponding attribute values. Each attribute
of a data set is assigned to a data type. Similar structured data sets are stored
in a table The data sets in a table have to diﬀer by at least one attribute
value. Thus, a table, in the mathematical sense, is a relation (s. Table 7.5).

The relations between entities are described by direct associations. An
association EM1 ←EM2 determines how many entities of EM2 may be
assigned to an entity of EM1. In practice, only four basic kinds of associations
are diﬀerentiated. Table 7.8 gives examples of such associations.

Each table needs a deﬁned primary key which is assigned to just one
attribute. Many databases also support segmented keys spanning several at-
tributes. In order to speed up the access on single data sets indexes can be
entered which may also be assigned to an attribute or a group of attributes.
However, each additional index requires additional memory space and com-
puting time.
The association between several relationships are represented by entity
relationship diagrams. The association are relationships themselves which are
implemented in databases also by tables. Figure 7.13 shows an example. The
entities article, pallet, bin location and batch are linked by the associations
joint-storage prohibition, unit load, batch and pallet bin assignment. In the
diagram the association type is shown on the connecting line.
Up to now this book described a database from the logical point of view
(logical schema). A database is deﬁned by three database schemes:

– The logical schema describes the table structure (see above).
– One or several external schemes describe views on the logical schema. Each
schema contains a section of the views, which is needed by or allowed for
the application, a user or a group of users.
– The internal schema describes the physical organization of the data storage
and the access organization.
Before data are entered, read and changed in a database this has to be
set up by means of a data deﬁnition language. This description deﬁnes the
tables, their structure and types of attributes as well as the indexes. DML
(data manipulation language) are used to operate in a database as well as
for data requests and changes. In most database systems DDL and DML
are combined in one language, the SQL (structured query language). With
SQL tables, indexes and views can be built and data can be searched, linked,
changed, inserted and deleted. Table 7.5 can be built with the commands
create table ARTICLE (
NUMBER
number(7)
NAME char(40)
WEIGHT number(8) )
The values are entered into the table with the commands
insert into ARTICLE values (3973684, PU foam, 0.800)
insert into ARTICLE values (3974954, Bitumen, 30.000)
insert into ARTICLE values (3978617, Spackle, 5.000)
The basic operations which can be performed in a table are described by
simple SQL examples. The result of such a link is always shown in a new
table.

242
7. Information and Communication Technology
– With the projection certain attributes (columns) can be chosen from the
table.
select NUMBER NAME from ARTICLE
The result appears in Table 7.5
3973684 PU foam
3974954 Bitumen
3978617 Spackle
The basic operations of the selection and the projection can be linked by
an additional where clause.
– With the selection certain tuples (lines) can be selected from a table18.
select * from ARTICLE where WEIGHT > 20.000
The result is shown in Table 7.5
3974954

.
– The join links the joint attributes of the two tables P and Q19. The result
is a table with a new structure which contains the joint attributes of both
original tables just once. The new tuple includes all combinations of the
tuples of P and Q with identical attribute values. A join of the tables
ARTICLE and UNIT LOAD is described in SQL by
select * from ARTICLE, UNIT LOAD
The result are all tuples or ARTICLE combined with all tuples of UNIT
LOAD20 with the same article number.
In addition to this natural join (⊗-join) there is the Θ join, which contains
further regulations for the attribute values [5]. A Θ join of the tables
ARTICLE and UNIT LOAD can be described in SQL by an additional
where clause.
select * from ARTICLE, UNIT LOAD
where ARTICLE.WEIGHT > 20.000
Other elementary links can be achieved by the operations (union),
(intersection) and (minus).
Databases are client-server applications where the actual database, the
database engine (DBMS: database management system) acts as server for
the clients. These clients are applications which perform the data operations.
In a WMS this may be, for example, a client for the maintenance of master
18 The * symbol after the select means that the stated tupels contain all attributes.
19 Two attributes are alike when their identiﬁer as well as their values are the same.

shown here for lack of space.

7.2 Data management
243
data or for the goods receipt. The database engine is either accessed via
library modules which are part of the database or via a standard protocol
such as the ODBC (open database connectivity). With ODBC an application
can link – possibly via a network – with a database to use its services. For
this purpose a suitable ODBC driver has to be installed on the client which
is generally included in the delivery.
In a client-server architecture of a database system each manipulated data
set has to be sent by the server – the database – to the client where it is ma-
nipulated and then returned. Frequent or extensive operations of such kind
– like the blocking of all shelves in an aisle – reduce the performance consid-
erably. Therefore most databases oﬀer so-called stored procedures. These are
functions stored on the server which, after being activated by a client, inde-
pendently carry out an operation without a data transfer between server and
client. Owing to the quick performance the data sets are blocked only for a
short time. This often results in a drastic increase of the overall throughput.
In addition to the relational database more and more object-oriented
database systems (ODBS) come on the market. They allow for the direct
positioning of software objects so that databases can also be used for object-
oriented techniques.
7.2.4 Availability of data
The availability of data stocks must not be mixed up with a safe integrity
or an access protection. These aspects are dealt with in the section Safety
of data stocks. The current data have to be available at all times (online
availability) and older data on request (oﬄine availability).
Uninterruptible power supply The availability of data has to be ensured
also in case of power failures and hardware defects. A power failure can
be bridged for a short time by means of an uninterruptible power supply
(UPS). During this time the power is provided by accumulator batteries.
The computer is informed about this load alternation by – mostly serial –
interfaces. If the line voltage is not restored after a certain time the operating
system has to close all applications and to “shut down” the computer to save
the data stock. The application programs have to shut down in a controlled
manner when they receive such a signal from the operating system. Running
transactions (cf. section 7.2.1) and open ﬁles have to be closed as well as the
connection to databases.
Redundant data management
Data protection in case of a hardware
breakdown can be achieved by a redundant data management. These methods
are known as RAID systems (redundant array of independent disks). The
levels linear and 0 have no redundancy but where nevertheless included in
the RAID scheme by the ANSI (American National Standards Institute)

244
7. Information and Communication Technology
which has deﬁned this standard. The most common methods are the levels 1
and 5. Levels 0 and 1 can also be used together. This method then is called
level 10 or level 0/1. The RAID levels described here are as follows:
RAID 0 is also called disk striping and has no redundancy. It is only used
to speed up the access and should therefore only be used together
with one of the other levels. The data ﬂow is divided into blocks and
written parallel on the installed drives. If there are n drives the blocks
1 to n are written on the drives 1 to n, then the blocks n+1 to 2n also
on the drives 1 to n, and so on in numerically ascending order. The
data are read analogously. This method does oﬀer no fault protection.
If a driver fails all data on the other drives will be lost.
RAID 1 is also called mirroring and is based on the double storage of
data (data mirroring). For this reason, only half of the disk space can
be used. When a drive fails the operations are carried out with the
remaining one.
RAID 5 adds a checksum to the data and distributes the data as well as
the checksum to diﬀerent drives. RAID 5 is ideal for frequent accesses
with small data volumes. For this reason it is often used in transaction-
oriented environments like databases. When a drive fails the data can
be reconstructed on the remaining drives.

Journaling
Another method to reconstruct data is journaling. All data
changes are stored in a journal ﬁle which is written always before the data
are changed. Based on the last backup the current status can be reconstructed

7.3 User interface
245
by a so-called recovery. For this purpose, the journal ﬁle has to be available.
The actual data ﬁle and the journal ﬁle are stored on diﬀerent hard disks so
that the loss of one of the two ﬁles does not cause too much trouble.
Backup Backups are used to reduce the damages caused by hardware break-
downs or external impacts like water, ﬁre or surges but also of involuntary or
voluntary deletions of ﬁles. The media should be exchangeable, e.g., CDs or
magnetic tapes, and stored at a safe place. Alternatively the data can also be
stored online at a remote location. Such backups are also oﬀered as remote
data transmission services (e.g., via a dedicated line).
A backup can refer to a speciﬁc application, a database, the ﬁle system
or a logical or physical hard disk.
It is advisable to make a backup of the complete system before starting
a new system. This also includes the operating system with all settings and
user programs in the form of a so-called image backup, i.e., the backup of the
complete hard disk. Thus, it is not necessary to reinstall the operating system
and the user programs, above all the settings of the system parameters, after
a hardware breakdown. The stored image can be copied directly on the hard
disk; however, the dynamical data are not updated. For an update these data
have to be saved at regular intervals. When the latest backup has been copied
the latest changes have to be reinstalled by means of the journal ﬁle. If the
journal ﬁle is no longer available the last changes can be made manually. In
addition to an occasional complete backup changes are saved by incremental
and diﬀerential backups to minimize the memory volume (cf. Table 7.9).
Backups are also used to ﬁle data for a later evaluation. Therefore, a ﬁling
system should be operated which not only takes technical but also organi-
zational precautions. These are, for example, backup programs, automation
of backup processes, responsibilities, ﬁling systems and recovery scenarios.
While in practice the backup often is well organized the recovery of damaged
data is often neglected.
Packers are used to pack the data of most ﬁling systems to minimize the
data volume. Most ﬁles contain multiple characters or character sequences
while text ﬁles are marked by long sequences of blanks or repeated words.
But in other ﬁles, as well, many character sequences occur repeatedly. Basic
methods save these multiple sequences just once and mark repetitions with
a reference to their ﬁrst occurrence. When sequences occur several times a
repetition counter stating the multiplicity is included into the packed ﬁle. This
basic principle has been extended and improved and today many diﬀerent
algorithms and programs can be used to pack ﬁles.
7.3 User interface
The user interface as a man–machine interface plays an important role in a
WMS. If a system is accepted by the users largely depends on the right choice

of terminals, an intuitive operator guidance and the ergonomic design of the
screen marks. This also has great eﬀect on the error rate.
7.3.1 Terminals
Terminals are all input/output devices which – in contrast to sensors and
actuators which built the interfaces to the conveyor technique – are directly
operated by the user.

Typical output devices

– Mouse or touch screen
– Keyboard
– Barcode scanner

7.3 User interface
247
Figure 7.15. Typical terminals with barcode scanner, text display, keyboard and
radio data transmission [Photo: SYMBOL]
These input/output devices are often combined into complex units for
special applications, for example:
– Mouse-controlled workstations emitting audio warnings over a loudspeaker.
– Radio terminals with text display, numerical keyboard and barcode scanner
(cf. Fig. 7.15).
– Status display by a control light and acknowledgment by means of a push
button.
7.3.2 Functional point of view
Terminals can be used as man-machine interface only with a suitable soft-
ware and a number of functions which have to be adjusted to the respective
operation. These functions interplay with the input and output and, on the
one hand, should guide the user purposefully but, on the other hand, should
not causelessly enforce a ﬁxed order.
Most important, it has to be possible to cancel an already started function
– as far as possible. The choice of a suitable function is supported by mostly
hierarchically structured select menus. The selection of the next level and the
return to the superordinate layer represent the statical navigation in a select

248
7. Information and Communication Technology
menu while the return to the last chosen level represents the dynamical nav-
igation. In the dynamical navigation a return can be cancelled by a forward.
When this navigation is used it should be made sure that input ﬁelds which
have been seized by values in the course of an earlier function are reﬁlled
with the preset values after a dynamical return.
Adequate standards have to be set for the input values and all values
entered by the user have to be checked with regard to their plausibility. This
means that it is not possible to enter unallowed characters, to exceed the
deﬁned value range and to infringe any interdependencies between the single
parameters.
The functions carried out at a workstation or device are assigned to one or
several roles. These functions are, for example, blocking/release of pallets and
bin locations or the change of a pallet assignment. Roles are, for example,
incoming goods inspections, quality checks and dispatches. In an assumed
scenario the incoming goods inspection as well as the quality assurance are
allowed to block pallets while only the quality assurance is entitled to release
pallets. Bin locations, for example, can be blocked and released only by the
dispatching.
7.3.3 Access control
Before functions are carried out in a WMS an access control should be made
for safety reasons. For this purpose, the WMS administrator stores the per-
sonal names, access data and the role this person is allowed to take. Access
data may be passwords or biometrical data21. At the start of work each per-
son has to log in at his/her workstation and to provide the access data – e.g.,
by entering the password or scanning the ﬁngerprint – for the access control.
After a successful login the workstation can be used for the roles for which
it has been set up and to which the respective user is entitled. The logout
should be made explicitly by the user. As an alternative or additional fea-
ture, the workstation may be blocked or the user may be logged out when no
entries have been made for a certain period of time. A blocked workstation
can only be released by a repeated successful login of the registered user.
Workstations with an access right may also be restricted. This gives a
stationary access – e.g., to exactly one or several deﬁned I-points or order-
picking stations – instead of a role-related access (storage, order-picking,
etc.). Except allowed individual functions further restrictions can be made
by granting certain rights (information about master data, blocking/release
of batches, etc.).
The access control should oﬀer dialogues in the user’s native language
(cf. section 7.3.4). The quality check may also require the traceability of users
as well as of payments for services. In these access control applications per-
sonal data are recorded and stored so that at least the protection of data
21 For example a ﬁnger print or iris image.

7.3 User interface
249
privacy has to be observed when such a system is introduced. It furthermore
is advised to include the staﬀand their representatives into such projects.
7.3.4 Internationalization
This section deals with the most important aspects of the internationalization
of user interfaces. Basically, inputs and outputs can be made depending on
the user or the location or according to a company or international standard.
Dialogue texts can be represented in the mother tongue of the current user
and can be selected manually or via the user proﬁle of the access control. The
terminals have to have the corresponding fonts or be able to load the fonts
from an external device. Since the usual 8-bit code often is not suﬃcient to
display some characters the Unicode, a 16-bit code was developed to support
the multi-lingual word processing.
Dates and times should be displayed in a distinctive form but may also
be displayed in the form common at the user’s location. Decimal may be
displayed in dots or the dot or comma notation but usually the regional form
is chosen.
Physical values – such as weights or dimensions – should correspond to
the international standard (MKS system: meter, kilogram, second). In identi-
ﬁcation suitable functions should allow for the conversion of diﬀerent quanti-
ties. New programming languages support the internationalization by suitable
data types and libraries.
7.3.5 Help systems and help functions
Manuals are not used during practical operations but mainly for training
purposes and can also be published online (cf. Fig. 7.16) so that they can
easily be searched with regard to their contents, catchwords or the complete
text (full text search). More important than the online manuals, however, is
a context-sensitive help which oﬀers information about the current function.
Of great help are displays of possible input values or value ranges. Adaptive
methods can provide selective details according to the history of the user
dialogue. Adaptive help functions are seldom used today or only in a very
rudimentary form. Instead, a ﬁxed variable, mostly a reference to the online
manual, is preset which appears in case of a repeated wrong entry. Additional
help functions may be reasonable in some cases:
– Electronic memo instead of “bits of paper”
– Electronic in-house mail system with a direct connection to the WMS
– Workstation-speciﬁc to-do lists for the cross-shift communication
– Workstation-speciﬁc calendar for the notiﬁcation of maintenance dates and
extraordinary events

An operating system is a program of a computer system which manages
and controls all components and initiates the startup of programs. It is an
abstraction layer which prevents the direct access of user programs on the
hardware of a computer and coordinates all activities.
Since the advent of the personal computer in the early 1980ies the term op-
erating system (OS) is often used to describe characteristics of the ﬁle system,
network capability and above all concepts of the user surface. An operating
system, however, oﬀers quite more elementary functions mostly hidden to
the user. For users of IT systems, it makes sense to know the basic principles
of an operating system which are described in short in this section. Further
functions like network compatible ﬁle systems and user surfaces are described
in other sections.
7.4.1 Tasks
An operating system is a software layer which protects the user programs
from a direct access on the hardware. It is responsible for providing resources
and services by means of the hardware. Resources are, for example, printers,
barcode scanners but also the memory on a hard disk. An operating system
has to perform the following tasks:

– Implementation of deﬁned chronological interdependencies between diﬀer-
ent user programs (synchronization)
– Provision of generally applicable program (libraries)
– Provision of a standardized input/output system (virtual I/O system)
– Provision of a memory management (virtual memory)
– Protection of the user programs against errors in other user programs
– Support of diﬀerent users with user-speciﬁc rights and mutual protection
(multiuser)
In short, the tasks of an operating system can be described as the presen-
tation of a logical computer (virtual machine) with user-oriented interfaces
on a high logical level.
The principle of the virtual machine as abstraction layer between hard-
ware and user programs can still be reﬁned further. Many modern operating
systems work with a so-called hardware abstraction layer (HAL) so that a
system provider can easily port his product to diﬀerent hardware systems.

7.4.2 Principles
This section introduces the basic principles and components of operating sys-
tems. For further and more detailed information please refer to publications
about OS [2], [76] or [101].
A basic function of each operating system is the management of diﬀerent
hardware systems, which are usually categorized as follows:
– Memory: The physical store where data and programs are stored during
runtime.
The hardware supports the dynamical classiﬁcation into read-only and
read-write areas. A MMU (memory management unit) permanently con-
trols the read-only area concerning writing access which it prevents. In case
of infringements it initiates an interrupt which then prompts the operating
system to shut down the respective program. More advanced safety mecha-
nisms like the access on memory areas of other programs22 and the alloca-
tion of memory space to the programs have to be provided by the operating
system (cf. p. 256). The deliberate controlled access of diﬀerent programs
on the same memory, however, should be supported (cf. section 7.4.2).
– Processors (CPU, Central Processing Unit): Here, the programs in the
memory are run. Modern hardware supports diﬀerent CPUs that have to
be managed by the operating system (cf. p. 254). Modern processors have
an integrated cache memory where frequently referenced commands and
data are buﬀered to speed up the access. The eﬃciency of a CPU is often
speciﬁed by the number of commands executable per time slot and by the
clock speed. But such key values are just one parameter for the evaluation
of the hardware performance. This is a combination of all components and
without consideration of the characteristics of the operating system and
the user programs these values are of no signiﬁcance for the user. Instead
benchmarks23 are used to determine the performance for a group of single
applications.
– Devices: These comprise the following groups of devices
– Interfaces: Parallel and serial interfaces such as RS232 or USB (cf. Chap-
ter 5).
– Network: Access on local and/or long-distance networks for the commu-
nication of computers via diﬀerent media (cf. section 7.1).
22 For reasons of data protection the read-only access on memories of other pro-
grams has to be prevented in any case, cf. section 7.8. A read-write access may
even be used for sabotage.
23 In this context benchmarks are deﬁned test runs of chosen programs of one or
several application categories with deﬁned input data running under a concrete
operating system on a speciﬁed hardware. The aim is, for example, to deﬁne the
response times and the medium throughput rate.

7.4 Operating systems
253
– Bulk memory: Bulk memories with random access24 such as hard disks,
ﬂoppy disks, CD-ROM and DVD, which are based on rotating media and
those without mechanically movable parts like ﬂash-media cards. One
criterion for the classiﬁcation of bulk memories is the exchangeability of
the storage media. This feature is of great importance for ﬁling but also
for data imports and exports and backups (cf. section 7.2.4).
– Screen: Screens are generally controlled by so-called graphic cards, i.e.,
sub-systems which receive a high data rate from the CPU. Based on these
data the graphic cards can independently perform complex operations.
The functioning of the screen has no eﬀect on the computer.
– Clock: The clock is a device of special importance. It initiates cyclical
interrupts which prompt the operating system to perform certain tasks
(cf. p. 254). Furthermore, the clock shows the current date and time. Op-
erating systems oﬀer further functions which set the time zones and, if
applicable, the summer time, set the timer for processes and synchronize
the computer clock in distibuted systems (cf. section 7.1.6).
The importance of the clock was widely recognized by the public at the
change of the millennium when the so-called “year-2000 problem” (Y2K
problem) occurred. This problem was caused by the two-digit display of the
year and mainly aﬀected the software with the exception of computers with
clocks which displayed the year in the same manner. New hardware clocks
are unstructured counters which show the number of time units which have
elapsed since a certain point of time.
Each user program is controlled by an operating system and allocated to
a process. A process is also called a task and in addition to the user programs
also includes information about the current status and the resource require-
ments and allocations. Tasks can be performed at any time sequentially or
concurrently. Concurrency means that processes can be carried out parallel
in time, but not necessarily. This chronological parallelism may also apply to
just some time intervals, may change strictly cyclically or cover the complete
runtime of a task. Since these chronological processes cannot be predicted
in a dynamical system with non-deterministic external events in this context
the term concurrency is used.
From the software-related point of view WMS are complex systems con-
sisting of several, partially concurrent tasks which exchange data, provide
services to each other and synchronize their program ﬂow at deﬁned points.
Recently, the term application has more and more established itself for sin-
gle user programs but also for more complex program systems. Accordingly,
WMS are applications.
In the following the main tasks of an operating system – above all in
combination with a WMS application – are described in detail.
24 Random access means that a program has at any time access to any “data set”
on this medium.

254
7. Information and Communication Technology
Control of the operating system processes The process control is re-
sponsible for performing the following tasks:
– Mutual exclusion: Only one process is allowed to access an exclusive re-
source at a time. A good example is a printer where several processes print
concurrently – without further precautions. To achieve good results only
one process can print at a time – the processes have to exclude them-
selves interactively. The principle of the mutual exclusion is also used con-
tinuously for all exclusive resources. Recent programming languages oﬀer
language constructs for the mutual exclusion.
– Synchronization: It has to be ensured that under certain conditions a pro-
cess can continue only when it receives a signal generated by another pro-
cess.
– Avoidance of deadlocks: It has to be avoided that a pool of processes is built
where one or more processes obstructs another one25. Since the deadlock
problem is of vital importance – not only with regard to operating systems
but also for databases and material ﬂow controls – this subject is described
in more detail in section 7.4.2.
– Communication: The exchange of messages between processes, the so-
called interprocess communication, has to be ensured. This communication
may be limited to the exchange of signals without additional information
or contain contents in the form of data sets. Furthermore, a data ﬂow
oriented communication can be used to exchange an unstructured ﬂow of
characters between the processes (cf. section 7.1).
Each process at any time represents one of the the three conditions “com-
puting”, “ready” or “blocked”. Blocked processes wait for a resource, the
completion of an I/O job or on a timer event. When the blocking is released
the process is set to the status “ready” and applies again for a CPU. The
processor management controls the allocation of processes to the processor(s)
and manages the corresponding process states.
The blocked processes wait passively, i.e., they practically require no com-
puting time. The operating system manages the events for which the blocked
processes are waiting and “awakes” them when the event occurs. The opposite
principle is the active waiting where a program detects an event by cyclically
scanning a condition. This principle is called polling and is sometimes used
in user programs but never in operating systems. The polling requires an idle
time τp between the single queries so that other processes can continue with
their program. If τp is small the polling process puts an extra load on the
CPU without providing any result. If τp is larger this increases the average
response time of τp/2.
25 In literature this deadlock problem is often discussed as the so-called “philoso-
pher’s problem”.

Figure 7.19. Principle of a round-robin scheduler
Processor management A ready process “applies” for the resource CPU.
The corresponding allocation principle is called scheduling and the relevant
program of an operating system is called scheduler. Generally, there are con-
siderably more processes than processors. To be able to handle all processes
the multiplexing is applied to the CPUs. According to this principle, the CPU
is removed from a process after a certain period of time (time slice, time por-
tion) and allocated to another process. When a scheduling is only based on
the time slice and when all ready processes are allocated to a CPU strictly
sequentially this is also called a round-robin scheduler (RR) (cf. Fig. 7.19).
In practice, a variety of other criteria are of importance for the schedul-
ing. A scheduling strategy, which is implemented in almost any operating
system, allocates priorities to the processes. These priorities are often dy-
namical, within certain limits: Processes which release the CPU because of
an input/output get a higher priority until they reach a given upper limit.
After the termination of a time slice the priority is decremented step by step
up to a lower limit. The scheduler always handles the processes with the
highest priority ﬁrst according to the RR principles and then the processes
of the next category. If a process with a higher priority is ready the current
process is interrupted – i.e., it is set to the status “ready” – and the scheduler
is activated.

256
7. Information and Communication Technology
In some operating systems the scheduler is a process itself with a high
but ﬁxed priority. Thus, processes with a priority higher than the scheduler
are no longer submitted to the RR principle and can only be interrupted
by a process with an even higher priority. Such processes are called realtime
processes.
Priority-oriented scheduling methods have a dynamic which adjusts to
the current system load – often according to considerably more algorithms.
Memory management Each process has a separate virtual address space
which is provided by the operating system and represented on the physical
memory by diﬀerent methods. The most commonly used method makes mul-
tiple use of the physical memory space and is, therefore, also called memory
multiplexing.
The usual procedure – the so-called paging – divides the memory in equal
pages. Unused pages can be copied (swapped out) with diﬀerent algorithms
into a background memory, a bulk memory with slower access but a consid-
erably larger capacity (in practice, this is the hard disk). This releases areas
of the physical memory for other programs.
When swapped out pages are requested this is called a page fault and the
pages are recopied (swapped in). At ﬁrst, however, other pages have to be
copied into the background to make room for the pages to be swapped in.
The corresponding algorithms are very extensive and also consider the access
rate on single pages as basis for a forecast [101].
The pages to be swapped out are stored in one or several ﬁles (swap-
ﬁle, page ﬁle26) or in one or several unformatted areas of the harddisk27
(cf. section 7.2.2). To increase the throughput by means of a concurrency
many operating systems support a distributed paging on diﬀerent drives.
A high page fault value per time unit always indicates a too small memory
while a too small page ﬁle always leads to an error message of the operating
system which is generally be indicated by warnings when a certain ﬁlling
degree is exceeded. If no measures are taken the following scenarios may
occur:
– The operating system suspends complete processes and swaps their mem-
ory contents in a separate background memory area, the so-called swap
ﬁle.
– the operating system by force closes down single processes.
– The problem is ignored what leads to a deadlock (cf. section 7.4.2). Such
a deadlock can often not be cancelled by closing a process because this
would require additional memory space which is no longer available.
26 In some systems the term swap ﬁle is used while in others this term is not used
for pagings but for complete swappings.
27 Hard disks are mostly divided into partitions which may contain ﬁle systems or
be used as raw device without a formatted applications or databases.

Device and resource management On its bottom level the device man-
agement communicates in realtime with the hardware. This is done by in-
terrupts prompted by the hardware which interrupt the program ﬂow and
branch into an interrupt service routine. This routine handles the interrupts
by exchanging data and signals with the requested device and then passes
the control back to the up to now idle program ﬂow.
On the next higher logical level the devices are managed as resources or
as operating facilities. A resource is not necessarily a physical device. Logi-
cal or virtual resources are, for example, are communication buﬀers, memory
areas used by several processes or database tables. They are generally used
exclusively by processes in case of a write access. Read-only accesses gen-

Figure 7.21. Deadlock situation in a resource allocation graph
erally lead to no status changes and can thus be performed concurrently.
This method is called mutual exclusion or in short mutex. The period of time
during which a resource is exclusively occupied by a process is also called a
critical region. Processes which want to enter a critical region at ﬁrst have to
request the respective resource from the operating system. If this is available
it is allocated; if not the process awaits its availability. The resource manage-
ment awakes the process as soon as the corresponding resource is available.
If several processes wait for the same resource their requests are managed
in a waiting queue according to the ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve principle (FCFS)28
In case of time-critical processes or for processes which occupy some other
resources it is possible and sometimes reasonable to diverge from the strict
FCFS principle.
The deadlock problem In an environments where the mutual exclusion is
ensured, processes wait inﬁnitely for the availability of resources and where
it is impossible to remove a resource from a process deadlock problems may
occur. A deadlock is a system blockade which can only be released by the
removal of resources preemption or by the enforced shut down of processes.
Figure 7.21 shows a typical deadlock situation by means of a resource
allocation graph. Processes and resources build the node of such a graph
while resource requests and allocations are represented by the edges. The
graph describes the following situation over the time for two processes (P1,
P2) and two resources: (BM1, BM2):
28 According to the ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve principle the ﬁrst process to request a
resource is the ﬁrst to be allocated to a resource, similar to the FIFO principle
which is also common in material ﬂow (section 2.2.3).

t3 : P1 requests BM2 and has to wait
t4 : P2 requests BM1 and has to wait
At the time t4 a deadlock occurs. Neither of the two processes can continue
without having to wait for the other.
Another way to represent the above-mentioned scenario is a diagram of
the process advancements (cf. Fig. 7.22). It shows by means of a trajectory
how such situations occur and how they can be avoided. Both axes of the
coordinate system represent the advancement of the two processes P1 and P2.
The graphs in such a diagram represent the advancement of both processes
and may be marked with the parameter t for time. Such graphs are also called
trajectories.
Under the assumption that a preemption is not allowed, these graphs
never contain a component in the negative axis direction. In case of a one-
processor system they always build ascending step curves. The resource re-
quired by both processes is entered at the axes. To ensure the mutual ex-
clusion must never cross a dark grey area. This would inevitably lead to a
deadlock when the area at the lower left side – the unsafe conditions – is
reached. Here, the deadlock prevention methods come into force which are
used by operating systems and sometimes also by databases.

260
7. Information and Communication Technology
An alternative to the deadlock prevention is to request all required re-
sources by an indivisible operation or to solve a deadlock problem by pre-
emption. If all required resources are allocated on the ﬁrst request of just one
resource this generally reduces the throughput because other processes have
to wait for this resource. But a deadlock can be avoided with this method.
After a preemption the operations performed up to then by the respective
resources become invalid and have to be repeated later on. This also leads to
a reduced throughput.
These interrelations also apply to material ﬂow systems. In Chapter 9 a
warehouse is described which is also prone to deadlock problems which have
to be avoided by means of suitable algorithms. A preemption is not advisable
and not always possible in this case because returns would be necessary after
transport interrupts.
Clocks The hardware clock sets the basis for
– the initiation of cyclical functions of the operating system such as the
scheduling which is hidden to the user
– the provision of timers
– the calculation of the current date and time
The hardware clock of a computer is always subjected to a certain drift
so that it has to be updated from time to time. This may be done manually
by a system administrator, by coupling it to an external reference clock ro by
means of a clock protocol (cf. section 7.1.6) in a computer network. The clock
must not be reset while the system is running because this would interfere
with the causality. If absolute times are used in a system a clock reset may
imply that the eﬀect of an uninvolved process lies before its cause. For this
reason, hardware clocks deliberately lose a little bit.
Such an eﬀect occurs, for example, when applications process ﬁles ac-
cording to the date of their creation or change. In software development all
programs are interpreted by the “make” command the ﬁles of which have been
created or changed before the last successful “make” request. If the clock had
been reset during the development, the program may be interpreted only par-
tially what leads to incompatible results and thus to programs which operate
faultily or not at all. Similar eﬀects may also occur in WMS when dates are
used as criteria for the execution of single work steps.
However, if a clock has to be reset this problem can be solved by means of
a software clock. This is always based on a hardware clock but in addition to
this oﬀers an oﬀset variable for time corrections. The software clock misses
single ticks so that the oﬀset is increased and the clock runs slower but never
backwards. In network systems this problem is solved by means of clock
protocols.

7.5 Programming languages
Programming languages are used to compile logical concepts into functioning
programs. They are a link between the program P of a programmer and the
machine M where the program should run. The term “machine” should not
be mixed up with the hardware because the operating system is a virtual
machine for the execution of programs29. Each program processes inputs I
and generates outputs O which in turn may be inputs for another program.
7.5.1 Compilers and interpreters
This section deals with the most important concepts and deﬁnes some terms.
The programming language of a program should be of minor importance to
the user as long as the provider guarantees for the correct functioning and
is available in case of changes, extensions and portings to another hardware.
But if this is not the case or when other providers should or have to be
involved the programming language becomes more important.
T diagrams (cf. Fig. 7.23) are a kind of graphical representation for these
interrelations [105]. During the runtime each program needs a machine which
is able to perform the program code. Seldom machines are available which
can directly handle the program code. This problem can be solved in two
ways:
– By means of a compiler the program code is interpreted into the language
which can be read by the machine. The program to be interpreted is called
source program or source code, the result of such a compilation is the ma-
chine code, which can be performed by a machine. Compilers can be divided
into the following two types:
– Assemblers are structure conserving, i.e., the program language can be
read by man but can also be performed by a machine. In this case, the
programs are written in an assembler language and compiled by an as-
sembler into the machine language. This kind of language is no longer
used for the programming of applications but for hardware-oriented de-
velopments.
– Compiler are interpreters which do not maintain the structure of the
program to be interpreted (cf. Fig. 7.25). Owing to this transformation
the compiler can perform extensive optimizations with the aim to create
small programs which require less memory space and short execution
times. Since the structure is transformed the compiling cannot be re-
verted so that the source code has always to be available for further
changes of the program logic. Most providers of WMS do not supply the
source code or just parts of it while the complete source code is provided
in open-source projects.
29 The operating system is a program as well but it hides the hardware for the
applications discussed here.

– Macro-expanders or Macro-processors are text replacement systems
where required program parts are replaced by parameterizable text mod-
ules, the so-called macros. A macro-processor replaces the formal pa-
rameters of the macros by the current parameters of the macro request.
Applications are not programmed by macros but some programming
languages use macros. The actual compiling is preceded by a separate
pass30 where the macros are expanded. On the one hand, this reduces the
desk work but, on the other hand, hides weak points in the programming
language [75].
– The source code is directly performed with the support of an interpreter,
i.e., a program which runs on a host and interprets and performs the com-
mands of an application (cf. Fig. 7.24). Thus, an interpreter is a virtual
machine which hides the features of the host to the applications.
Applications are developed with compilers and/or interpreters. Both basic
principles have advantages as well as disadvantages:
– An interpreter facilitates the immediate performance of a program without
an interpretation. When an interpreter is used the execution times are
longer than for compiled programs.
– Compilers analyze the program during the compile time while interpreters
analyze it during the runtime, i.e., when the program is being executed.
This analysis is able to identify programs with a faulty syntax. When it is
30 A pass is the performance of the complete source code by a program. Compilers,
for example, operate with several consecutive passes such as syntax analysis,
code generation and code optimization.

performed only during the runtime one of its potentials is not completely
utilized.
– Compiled programs are not portable. Thus, an application can only run
on the computer and under the operating systems it was designed for. In
some cases, it is even restricted to the version of the operating system. To
be able to run the program on another computer at least the source code
and a suitable compiler have to be available while a program can run on
any computer with a corresponding interpreter.
A synthesis of the compilation and interpretation principles oﬀers a good
compromise between execution speed, compile time analysis and portability.
The source code is compiled into a machine-independent intermediate code
which can be performed by all computers with an adequate interpreter.
The most commonly used programming system which is based on this
concept is Java. A source code written in Java is interpreted by a Java
compiler into the so-called bytecode, a binary code which is independent of

264
7. Information and Communication Technology
the hardware and an operating system (cf. Fig. 7.26). Thus, all lexical, syn-
tax and some semantical errors are identiﬁed already during the compiling
(cf. section 7.5.2). In addition to this, the compiler can optimize the code.
The resulting byte code is very compact and is interpreted by a virtual Java
machine (VM ) during the runtime. This concept is suitable for the creation
of distributed applications. kap9 describes a Java-based WMS.
7.5.2 Language concepts
Programming languages are described by
– their lexical elements
– their syntax structure
– their semantics
The lexical elements are the atomic units, the “characters” of the source
code, i.e., keywords, numerical constants, character sequences with a ﬁxed
contents, operators and identiﬁers for variables and functions.
The syntax structure describes the “sentence structure” of a program
and is formally described by a recursive deﬁnition, by the Backus–Naur form
(BNF) or a similar notation or by Syntax diagrams. Syntaxes are represented
by grammar symbols. The syntax of a programming language is speciﬁed
by a number of rules with exactly one grammar symbol on the left side
and a sequence of grammar symbols and lexical symbols on the right side.
Syntax diagrams graphically represent these rules by rectangles and circles
or rounded rectangles. In contrast to the syntax diagrams the BNF shows
special operators and symbols on its right side to simplify the representation.
Optional symbols or symbol sequences are put into squared brackets while
accolades indicate that the corresponding symbol sequence is iterative and
may thus appear in a program in series (cf. Fig. 7.27).
The semantics of a programming language generally is described verbally
to the programmers. One example of semantics is the observance of signa-
tures, i.e., when a function is deﬁned and requested the number and types of
parameters have to correspond to the declaration.
7.5.3 Language generations
Programming languages can be categorized as follows:
1. First generation: This is the machine code, i.e., the language which can
be directly performed by the computer hardware without interpretation.
2. Second generation: The assembler code has the same structure as the lan-
guages of the ﬁrst generation and facilitates the programming by means of
mnemonic codes, i.e., plain writing identiﬁers for commands and storage
addresses. Before this code is performed it always has to be interpreted
by an assembler.

3. Third generation: The problem-oriented programming languages are of-
ten considered as advanced programming languages and can be inter-
preted either directly or after a compiling – depending on the language
type and the availability of the interpreter and compiler.
4. Fourth generation: (4GL: 4th Generation Language): Programs are mainly
written in natural language. The necessary data structures and algo-
rithms are generated or chosen by a compiler and/or interpreter. A typi-
cal example of a 4GL language is SGL which is used for database queries
and manipulations.
7.6 Basic principles of object-oriented programming
This section describes the basic idea of the object-oriented programming.
Object-orientation is not just a programming technique but also a method to
analyze and design systems. The last sub-section shortly deals with these as-
pects. Transport devices are described which are able to transport unit loads
from one location to another. These images include UML symbols (uniﬁed
modelling language, (cf. section 7.6.4) as well as code pieces written in Java.
7.6.1 Data abstraction
The traditional programming is either based on data structures or the func-
tions. The basic idea of data abstraction is to combine data and functions
into a unit. These data, which may consist of such units, are accessed exclu-
sively via these functions. This principle is also called information hiding and
prevents a direct access on the data31 and oﬀers the following advantages:
– The standardized interfaces of the function query are abstracted from the
basic data
– The details of the access functions and the underlying data are hidden to
the initiator.
– The data integrity is assured exclusively by the access functions and not
by the initiator
– Additional changes can be made locally and without aﬀecting their initia-
tors.
At ﬁrst this exclusive use of the function interface and the explicit pro-
hibition of a direct access seems very complex for “simple” variables. The
advantages become visible at a second sight when the software is upgraded
and when at each access on a variable other variables have to be changed
or other functions have to be requested. Only the corresponding functions
31 However, many programming languages which support this concept grant direct
data access. This has to be prevented by programming disciplines.

7.6 Basic principles of object-oriented programming
267
have to be upgraded while the interface to the program remains unchanged.
To use this function the programmer just needs a self-explanatory name; the
details are hidden to him.
For example, the additional request can be made in a WMS to record the
time for which a storage bin has been blocked in an operating protocol. In
Java the change could directly be programmed as follows32:
...
// Choice of a storage bin bin
...
// The chosen bin is marked as blocked
bin.blocked = true;
...
In this programming language all allocations to the variable block have
to be replaced later on by corresponding function requests or be completed
by additional commands. When the information hiding principle is used this
line bin.blocked = true has to be replaced by bin.block(), i.e., corre-
sponding function requests. The function block allocated to the bin would
be programmed as follows:
class bin {
...
public void block()
{ blocked = true;
}
public void unblock() { blocked = false; }
...
}
By extending the data type bin by the variable startBlock the functions
can now be extended as follows:
class bin {
long startBlock;
...
public void block() {
if (! blocked) {
block = true;
startBlock = getTime_ms();
}
}
public void unblock() {
long delta;
if (blocked) {
block = false;
delta = (System.currentTimeMillis() - startBlock)/1000/60;
logbook.println( "bin " +
name +
"was blocked" + delta +
"minutes.");
}
}
...
}
32 The double slash marks the rest of the respective line as a comment.

268
7. Information and Communication Technology
In this case, the request position remains the same so that the number of
software parts to be changed and tested remains small.
7.6.2 Classes and objects
The description of the entity of all logically related data descriptions and
functions is called class, the data are called attributes and the functions
methods of this class. A class contains no attribute values33 but only meta-
data. To generate data at ﬁrst an object of this class has to be generated
which is also called the instance of its class and has a memory for the stor-
age of attribute values. Any number of objects can be generated from each
class under consideration of the limited memory space. In most programming
languages the operator for the instantiation of classes is set to new.
This principle, however, does not guarantee that all attributes are initial-
ized. For this purpose, the object-based technique oﬀers special functions, the
constructors. In most programming languages constructors have to bear the
name of their class and each class has to contain at least one constructor34. If
needed, several constructors can be speciﬁed when they have diﬀerent param-
eter lists (signatures)35. The initialization of a class at ﬁrst provides memory
space for its attributes and then carries out the constructor requested by the
programmer.
A rack feeder, for example, may be represented by a class AS/RS. This
class may contain several constructors which are shown below in a very simple
Java code:
class AS/RS {
// Definition of a constant for the idle position of all AS/RS
private final position homepos = new
Position(1, 1);
// Attribute for the current position of the AS/RS
private Position pos;
AS/RS () {
// Generation of a new instance for the attribute pos
pos = new Position();
// Setting the position coordinates from the constant
// homepos
pos.setx(homepos.x());
pos.sety(homepos.y());
}
AS/RS (int x, int y) {
// Generation of a new instance for the attribute pos
33 The static attributes to which values of a class are allocated are not studied here.
34 Most programming languages provide implicit default constructors which, how-
ever, cannot replace a speciﬁc initialization of attributes with the interdepen-
dencies of their values.
35 This overload technique is also allowed for methods.

7.6 Basic principles of object-oriented programming
269
pos = new Position();
// Setting the position coordinates which are transferred
// to this constructor as parameter
pos.setx(x);
pos.sety(y);
}
S/RS (String pos) {
// Generation of a new instance for the attribute pos
pos = new Position();
// The class position can calculate the coordinate values
// also from a string
pos.setByName(s);
}
}
A new instance of a rack feeder can be generated in three diﬀerent ways:
– AS/RS as/rs1 = new AS/RS() for a new rack feeder. The newly created
object of the class AS/RS is named as/rs1 and is created with the standard
initialization, the idle position (1,).
– AS/RS as/rs1 = new AS/RS(2, 3) for a new rack feeder with the current
position (2,3).
– AS/RS as/rs = new AS/RS("E2T3") for a new rack feeder with current
position which is described by the character sequence E2T3.
The opposite of a constructor is the destructor which releases the re-
sources occupied by the object. Finally, the destructor releases the memory
space occupied by the object36.
7.6.3 Inheritance
An analysis of objects represented by a software shows that these have joint
functions or attributes. A “conveyor”, for example, can transport unit loads
from one storage location to another. This can be achieved by diﬀerent tech-
nical features which often oﬀer additional functions. The basic idea of the
object orientation adds the specialization of classes to the above-mentioned
object-based concept .
A class which provides methods and attributes can be specialized by a
derivation. The more general class is called basic class, the more specialized
class derived class. This principle is also called inheritance since the derived
classes “inherit” the attributes and methods of their basic class.
The principle of inheritance is shown in Fig. 7.28 at the example of the
basic class transport facility for all transport facilities and a derivation
36 Because of the automatic memory management in Java systems it cannot be
predicted when the destructor is performed. In C++ systems destructors are
performed immediately when a delete operator is used for an object. The concepts
diﬀer considerably but this does not impair basic understanding of this technique.

Figure 7.28. Derivation of one class each of AS/RS and sliding cars from the
basic class transport facilities. Attributes are marked with “-” and methods
with “+”
each for rack feeders and sliding cars. Both derived classes can be instan-
tiated while in this case no objects can be generated from the basic class.
The basic class just provides some attributes and declares some methods,
i.e., it speciﬁes an interface. WMS which include AS/RS as well as sliding
cars can operate with the methods of the class transport facility. Only
during the instantiation the programmer has to take care that the object is
generated exactly from the class which describes this transport facility. The
programming system ensures that always the correct method is called.
If methods are deﬁned by a basic class as well as by the derived class the
methods of the derivation are requested; otherwise the methods of the basic
class.
Derivated classes can include further attributes and methods which are
not declared in the basic class. Such methods cannot be requested via the
interface of the basic class because they are unknown there37. One example is
a curve-going AS/RS (allows to convert the AS/RS in diﬀerent aisles) which
can swap the aisle by means of the method changeAisle().
The derivation principle can be used in several ways so that a complete
tree of other classes can be derived from a basic class, e.g., the class AS/RS.
37 In this case the object has to be converted into an object of the derived type
(type casting).

7.7 Extensible markup language: XML
271
7.6.4 Uniﬁed modelling language
The object-oriented programming is just one aspect of the object-oriented
software which includes a comprehensive approach from analyses over the
design and programming up to tests. For this purpose, a variety of software
development tools has been developed, e.g., the uniﬁed modelling language
(UML) to simplify the notations. This modelling language includes a number
of graphical notations for very diﬀerent views; the most common diagrams
are:
– A use case diagram describes the interaction of actuators – in this case the
WMS operator – with the system to be analyzed. This kind of diagram is
used to informally represent such interrelations.
– Class diagrams represent the derivation relationship and associations be-
tween classes. Fig. 7.28 shows a derivation relationship in a UML notation
while associations are shown in Fig. 7.13 similar to associations in an entity
relationship diagram.
– Interaction diagrams describe the collaboration behavior of object groups:
sequence and collaboration diagrams. Sequence diagrams (cf. Fig. 7.29)
show the behavior of objects along their “lifeline” which can be seen as
a kind of time axis38. Collaboration diagrams oﬀer the same information
without considering the lifeline.
– Activity diagrams (cf. Fig. 7.30) represent a series of activities, either con-
ditional or concurrent.
The system described in Chapter 9 was designed with UML. The diagrams
can be found on the Internet under www.mywms.org.
7.7 Extensible markup language: XML
XML is a meta language for the free deﬁnition of other languages by which
data structures can easily be described, corresponding values can be speciﬁed
and transported to the data. Owing to the suggestive structure of XML and
the variety of tools which are available in diﬀerent versions and qualities
data ﬂows can easily be processed in the XML format. This ensures a high
compatibility between diﬀerent software and hardware products.
7.7.1 Key-value-coding
In the past data were often transported by telegrams where the values have
to be written consecutively and in a given order. Unlike the XML format in
38 Here, the main focus is not set on time but cause-eﬀect relationships are studied.
This diﬀerence is important above all for distributed applications.

272

Figure 7.29. Example of a UML sequence diagram
a telegram the data are placed in a given order on ﬁxed positions or they are
separated by delimiters. To be able to plan such telegrams the data have to be
known in detail because to change them afterward would require considerable
eﬀort. If not all data are sent within a telegram the corresponding positions
in the related byte stream have to be ﬁlled with zeroes or marked as empty.
XML uses the so-called key-value coding which analogous to a dictionary
represents one or several values for each key. Thus, there never is a value
without a key. On the other hand, there may be a key without a value which
may even be reasonable. As an extension of the pure key-value coding XML
allows for the multiple denotation of a key.
The key values of an XML document are combined into elements where
the key is written as element name and the value as element content within
the element tag39. Written in angle brackets the element name builds the
start tag introducing the element. It is followed by the element content and
then by the end tag which, also in angle brackets and preceded by a slash
repeats the element name.
The contents of elements may consist of further elements. If, for example,
a stored article, e.g., a can of peas, should be described in XML this could
look as follows whereas the characteristics of the article are framed by the
start tag <article> and the end tag </article>:
<article>
<ean>401234500001</ean>
<name>peas</name>
<quantity>850</quantity>
39 A tag is the character sequence which gives the element its name.

</article>
Alternatively, attributes can be used in XML which contain the charac-
teristics of an element. The attribute values have to be included in pairs in
apostrophes or quotations. If an element has no content, the end tag can be
omitted if the last character before the closing angle bracket is a slash. This
is no longer called a start and end tag but an empty element tag. The article
is then described as follows:
<article
ean="401234500001"
name="peas"
quantity="850"
unit="ml"
packaging="can"
/>
If mnemonic (self-explaining) names are used to denote the elements,
XML can be used to get a self-documenting description of data structures.
The above example of an article element shows that it is possible to use
sub-elements and to build attributes for elements. It is also possible to mix
both procedures as is shown below at a customer description, which, because

274
7. Information and Communication Technology
of the self-explaining element and attribute names, has not been explained
further:
<customer title="Mr" name="Duck" surname="Donald"
customer no="123">
<addresse type="supplier" road="Minnie Street 3"
city="Ducktown" zipcode"44227"/>
<addresse type="invoice" road="Goose Road 42"
city="Ducktown" zipcode="44227"/>
<telephone type="work">+49-231-21282</telephone>
<telephone type="private">+49-231-56080</telephone>
</customer>
The resulting XML documents, i.e., documents which have a start tag and
an end tag for an element (in the correct order and nesting) or just an element
empty tag and where the attributes of the start tag and the element empty
tag are used as shown above are called well-formed or admissible. Below, an
example of an inadmissible XML document:
<tag1>
<tag2>
</tag1>
</tag2>
<tag3>
<tag4>
</tag3>
Generally it can be said that XML, if correctly used, in combination
with the key-value coding has many advantages compared to the telegram.
In addition to self-documentation, attention should also be given to the fact
that there is no deﬁned order of elements (and of their attributes). Another
advantage is that optional ﬁelds can simply be omitted.
7.7.2 The syntax of XML
With the help of DTD, the document type deﬁnitions of schemes XML doc-
uments can be restricted. Such a restriction is important to validate this
document. While the admissibility of an XML document can be derived from
its structure, i.e., the correct handling of elements independent of its contents
the scheme or the DTD speciﬁes the validity of a document by checking the
existence or absence of certain elements as well as the observance of nestings.
The example below shows a DTD for the above example of a customer
element. The element customer consists at least of one element address and
any number of telephone elements whereas address consists of an element
empty tag and telephone of a start and an end tag:

7.7 Extensible markup language: XML
275
<!ELEMENT customer (address+,telephone*)>
<!ELEMENT address EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT telephone (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST customer
title
CDATA #REQUIRED
name
CDATA #REQUIRED
surname
CDATA #IMPLIED
customer no

<!ATTLIST addresse

(supplier|invoice) "invoice"
road
CDATA #REQUIRED
city
CDATA #REQUIRED
zipcode
CDATA #REQUIRED >
<!ATTLIST telephone
typ e
(work|mobile|private) "private" >
DTDs should be used with care because in the element above telephone
with the attribute type=“private“ may occur several times in a customer
element or telephone may consist of an element empty tag and contain no
number at all. In the last case, the telephone number could be deﬁned as
an attribute in telephone. However, DTD cannot check the correctness of a
telephone number; any entered character sequence would be valid.
The content of XML documents can be checked much better by means of
schemes which are able to analyze also attributes and element contents.
7.7.3 Parsers and processors
The basic tool for the processing of XML documents are parsers and proces-
sors, although with diﬀerent goals: While the processor converts an existing
XML document into another form using a style sheet the parser reads the
document and provides the included elements and their attributes for further
processing.
There are two types of parsers: On the one hand, the DOM, the Document
Object Model and, on the other hand, the SAX – simple API for XML. The
diﬀerence between the two parser models is the way how they process the
XML documents. While DOM reads the complete document and represents it
in the form of a DOM tree40 with a root element SAX operates according to
the stream editor (comparable to sed under UNIX) and immediately returns
each completely recognized construction.
DOM and SAX behave diﬀerently: While DOM works more slowly be-
cause of its tree structure SAX processes, the elements and thus the complete
40 In computer sciences a tree is often used to represent nested structures.

276
7. Information and Communication Technology
document relatively quick. If SAX detects an error in a long XML document
the actions are diﬃcult to reverse. DOM, on the other hand, starts the pro-
cessing only after the complete tree has been built from an XML document
and the document has been validated.
However, DOM needs much more memory space and in case of very large
XML documents it may happen that it cannot be processed with DOM.
Unlike the SAX concept the DOM parser is able to generate XML documents
and to process existing documents interactively.
The diﬀerent parsers are provided by the developers partly as freeware41.
Parsers often have a diﬀerent performance. Parsers and processors are avail-
able with standardized interfaces for diﬀerent programming languages (e.g.,
C, C++ and Java) and can directly be integrated into existing applications.
7.7.4 Variety with style sheets
The example of customer shown in section 7.7.1 could be converted into an
order by adding an element orderItem to a new element order. The element
orderItem is based on the element article shown in section 7.7.1 to which
it adds price and number. The respective DTD looks as follows:
<!ELEMENT order (customer,orderItem+)>
<!ELEMENT customer
...
>
<!ATTLIST customer
...
>
<!ELEMENT orderItem EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST orderItem ean

CDATA
#REQUIRED
quantity
CDATA
#REQUIRED
unit
CDATA
#REQUIRED
packaging
CDATA
#REQUIRED
price
CDATA

number

#REQUIRED >
With the DTD above XML documents of the type order can be validated.
The following example shows a well-formed and admissible XML document:
<order>
<customer titel="Mrs" name="Marple"
surname="Jane"
customer no="0042">
<addresse
type="invoice" road="Highstreet 42"
city="St. Marymead"
zipcode="1650" />
</customer>

Figure 7.31. Conversion of an XML document by means of a style sheet
An order written in XML can be converted with a processor and a suitable
style sheet. The output format is determined by the contents of the style sheet
so that diﬀerent results can be achieved with the same processor and input
data but diﬀerent style sheets.
Figure 7.31 shows two diﬀerently formatted orders.While the processor
converts the XML document with a style sheet into an SQL statement for
database processing the same processor (or another one) converts the XML
document into a browser compatible HTML ﬁle.
7.8 Safety aspects
When data worth being protected are exchanged via networks safety regula-
tions have to be set up with the aim of ensuring the conﬁdentiality, integrity
and assignment of data to their owner or sender as well as their availabil-
ity. These safety regulations have to protect the data against random events
as well as against targeted attacks. Cryptography is an important tool for
ensuring the conﬁdentiality, integrity and assignment of data.
The availability of data is achieved by diversity and distribution – both
can be ensured by backups (cf.. section 7.2.4) – as well as by error tolerances
[99].
In addition to the contents of a communication its conditions may also be
worth to be protected. The most important aspects are the anonymity and

278
7. Information and Communication Technology
protection of the communication partners. These may be persons, programs
or processes of the operating system. A communication proﬁle provides rough
data based on which conclusions can be drawn concerning warehouse move-
ments, customer behavior or sales volumes with no or limited knowledge of
the communication contents.
Physically distributed WMS and/or WMS in network environments are
particularly vulnerable. E-commerce systems need billing processes where the
quality characteristic safety plays a major role. In the following sections the
principles are described in the example of an e-mail exchange which can easily
be transferred to other scenarios in distributed applications.
7.8.1 Secrecy
Messages have been kept secret on their way from sender to recipient for
several thousand years. In recent years new procedures have been developed
which also meet highest safety requirements.
To keep data secret or otherwise safe they are encoded. The basic en-
coding principle is based on an encryption as well as a decryption algorithm
using keys (cf. Fig. 7.32). These algorithms and keys can be structured quite
diﬀerently. The safety of the code, however, should always be ensured by the
key and not by the algorithm. By means of the key K the message M is
compiled in an encoded message MK with the encoding function E42.

42 E stands for encryption.

7.8 Safety aspects
279
Symmetrical or secret encoding methods use the same key for encryption
and decryption. The main problem here is the secure exchange of keys. For
this purpose, sender and recipient need a separate transmission channel be-
cause the channel used for the transmission of messages is not encrypted and
thus insecure. The security can further be increased by sending the data in
several packets – if possible via diﬀerent channels.
The data are decrypted by an inverse function E−1 which compiles the
encoded message MK into the plain text M with the same key K43.
E−1(K, MK) →M
or:
E−1(K, E(K, M)) = M
Because of the diﬃcult exchange of keys this method does no longer meet
the requirements of an electronic communication.
Asymmetrical encoding methods or methods with public keys use diﬀerent
keys for the encryption and decryption. These keys are the key Ke on the
sender side and key Kd known on the receiving side [96]. The encryption
function E diﬀers from the decryption function D.
D(Kd, E(Ke, M)) = M
The key exchange problem does not occur since Kd cannot be derived
from Ke – or only at great expense. A simple example is a method where an
integral number is partitioned into its prime factors: While the product can
easily be partitioned into its prime factors the reverse is possible but only
at great expense44. This expense depends on the size of the number – i.e.,
on the length of the key. The recipient generates of pair of keys (Ke, Kd).
The private or secret key Kd remains at the sender while the public key Ke
is available to all potential senders. This explains the often used term public
key system. The sender encrypts his message with the public key, sends it via
the transmission channel to the recipient who, by means of the private key,
converts the message into the plain text.
Practical methods are diﬀerent with regards to their algorithms, the
length and distribution of their keys. One example is the RSA method (Rivest,
Shamir and Adelman), which is based on the above-mentioned prime number
partition [99]. The length of the keys is independent of the algorithm and
determines the security degree. An eﬃcient computer needs several months
to partition currently used keys with a length of 128 bit into their prime
43 The functions E and E−1 may be identical, e.g., the bit-wise XOR link of the
message with the key.
44 Each natural number n can be represented as potence of prime numbers P:
n = k
i=1 P ei
i ; e.g., 1024 = 210, 7007 = 72 × 111 × 131
In case of large numbers the partition is very complex.

280
7. Information and Communication Technology
numbers. On the opposite, the product of the prime factors can be calcu-
lated by some multiplications. Principally, KE can be calculated out of KD.
The required eﬀort – above all the required time – increases exponentially to
the length of the key so that keys of an adequate length are always secure
enough. Public keys may be sent directly from the recipient to the sender
via insecure channels or be published via central services. With regard to
security the asymmetrical methods with their open systems prevail.
7.8.2 Integrity assurance
On its way from sender to recipient a message must not be forged by a third
party. This integrity assurance protects the data against external aﬀects.
Order quantities, for example, which initiate a retrieval in a WMS, could be
altered during their transmission. As a consequence, the complete inventory
could be delivered and would not be available for other customers until the
situation would be cleared and the stocks are returned.
The integrity can be assured by encryption. In a system with symmetrical
keys the hacker has to have two secret keys, one to read and one to change
the message. In asymmetrical systems the hacker has to have the recipient’s
secret as well as his public key.
7.8.3 Authentication
The integrity of a message can be assured by encryption. In asymmetric
system everyone can sent a message to its owner and prevent to be someone
else if he/she is in possession of the public key. For example, he/she can easily
send orders to a supplier under the name of another customer. The supplier,
however, has to be sure that the sender of the order is identical to the sender
stated in the order. This authentication problem can also be solved by means
of asymmetrical keys. There is quite a number of authentication protocols
[77] which either call for a cental. reliable instance or the mutual knowledge
of the public key.
The second case is described in a simple example with the participants A
and B. A wants to communicate with B and agrees upon a session key KS
valid for the duration of the session. This session key has to be exchanged via
a secure channel. For this purpose, an asymmetrical pair of keys is deﬁned:
(KEA, KDA) for A and (KEB, KDB) for B. After the authentication this ses-
sion key is known only to both participants who now use it for a symmetrical
procedure. An advantage of symmetrical systems are their considerably faster
algorithms.
1. A randomly chooses a number RA which he/she encrypts with the public
key KEB of B. A sends the resultE(KEB, RA) to B.
2. B decrypts the message with his/her secret key KDA.

7.8 Safety aspects
281
3. Since only the owner of this key can decode the message the random num-
ber chosen by A is returned to A as a “proof”. In addition to this, B also
generates a random number and a session key. B encrypts the received
random number RA, his own random number RB and the session key
KS with A’s public key KEA. B sends the result E(KEa, (RA, RB, KS))
to A.
4. A decodes the message with his/her secret key. When the received random
number RA corresponds with the number sent in step 1 B is reliable and
the procedure can go on. If not, the procedure is terminated.
5. A operates with the session key E(KS, RB) which he received from B.
He/she encodes the random number generated by B with the session key
and sends the result E(KS, RB) to B.
6. B decodes the received message with the session key. When the decoded
random number RB corresponds to the number generated in step 3 A is
reliable and starts to communicate.
For this method each communication partner has to know the public key
of the other and the keys have to be assigned reliably to a participant. Public
keys are managed in so-called trust centers which guarantee for the reliability
of each participant.
An alternative to this are logical networks which set up decentrally a
reliability variable. When A trusts the communication partner B and B trusts
C then A also trusts C although to a somewhat lesser degree. Thus, the
trustworthiness among the participants of a communication network can be
propagated dynamically.
7.8.4 Authentication and electronic signature
It may be important for the sender as well as the recipient of a message to
proof his/her authenticity. Here, we describe the basic principle of just one
method based on asymmetrical keys. A prerequisite for this method is that
in addition to the above characteristic D(Kd, E(Ke, M)) = M this method
can also be performed with “swapped” keys:
E(Ke, D(Kd, M)) = M
Thus, messages encoded with the private key can be decoded with the
public key of the sender. For this purpose, the sender at ﬁrst encodes the
message with his/her secret key and then with the public key of the recipient.
In the ﬁrst step the message can only be decoded by the recipient with his/her
private key. In the second step the recipient decodes the message with the
public key of the sender. Since this key is only known to the sender, the
recipient can be sure that the message was actually generated by him/her
and that he/she cannot deny its existence and contents. The recipient cannot
change the contents of the message afterwards because in case of a conﬂict

the sender can request the message encoded with his/her private key as a

basic procedure is explained in ﬁgure 7.33.
Since the expenditure for this two-step encoding is very high faster meth-
ods are used in practice which are also based on this principle and require
the mutual knowledge of the public keys and their reliability.

8. Realization of Warehouse Management
Systems
It takes about nine months to implement a WMS1. This shows that the in-
troduction of a WMS cannot be compared to the installation of a software
application like word processing, but has to be seen as a project2. Further-
more, the smooth operation of the warehouse during this time cannot always
be guaranteed. Malfunctions may occur for diﬀerent reasons (e.g., diﬃculties
with the adaptation of new work processes, the operation of new software or
the integration of new hardware). These malfunctions cost a lot of time and
money and have to be minimized as far as possible.
A careful planning prior to the project start and a targeted implemen-
tation are, thus, indispensable. This chapter describes the systematic imple-
mentation of a WMS which basically corresponds to the introduction of a
software of the same in size industry and trade (cf. Table 8.1).
In the following the single steps of the project are described including
the respective requirements, activities and results. Two project types can be
diﬀerentiated according to the initial situation:
1. The replacement of an existing WMS.
2. The introduction of a new WMS in line with the construction of a new
warehouse.
In both cases, the project is carried out in the same way; however, ad-
ditional restrictions have to be considered when an existing warehouse is
replaced. For this reason, the following sections focus on such a situation.
Should the procedure diﬀer considerably for the new construction of a ware-
house this will be mentioned explicitly.
The basic procedure is deﬁned in the German standard VDI 2523 (Project
management for logistic systems in material ﬂow and warehousing).

project is limited in time, has a deﬁned goal, is carried out once and is cross-
sectional.

8.1 Requirement deﬁnition
The project phase requirement deﬁnition is marked above all by the realiza-
tion that the existing WMS no longer meets the requirements and/or the
status quo has to be improved.
There are various reasons for the introduction or revision of a warehouse
management system whereas an increase in eﬃciency is the major one. Other
reasons are, for example:
– Introduction of a new warehouse technology (e.g., automatic high-bay
warehouse) or of a new article to be stored (e.g., hazardous goods)
– Rationalization or increase of the key performance indicators by introduc-
ing new technologies (e.g., increase of the manual order-picking perfor-
mance by pick-to-light)
– Use of the warehouse for diﬀerent owners of the goods (multi-client capa-
bility)

8.1 Requirement deﬁnition
285
– Integration of additional value-adding warehouse activities (Value Added
Logistics, VAL)
– Outsourcing of logistic services
– Changed warehouse processes (e.g., improved quality assurance and docu-
mentation)
– Changed order structure or ordering behavior (e.g., because of a contin-
uously increasing picking performance because of smaller quantities per
order which is not eﬃciently covered by the system)
– Integration of e-commerce solutions (e.g., integration of an online shop)
– Changed requirements on the performance of the WMS (e.g., improved
ergonomics)
– Securing the future by replacing outdated hardware and software (e.g.,
introduction of new databases)
– New interfaces to superordinate ERP and PPS systems (e.g., introduction
of an ERP system on a company-wide level)
– etc.
8.1.1 As-is analysis
Because of the many requirements put on a new WMS, the coordinated and
exact documentation of the status quo is of special importance. It is based
on the as-is analysis and consists of the following steps:
Recording of the business processes and the information ﬂow The
aim of a business process record is to completely document all business pro-
cesses3 in a warehouse, mostly in the form of a business process chain. In
addition to the physical activities also the information ﬂow and the use of
documents are recorded so that, for example, media breaks (change between
two diﬀerent media , e.g., EDP and paper) which aﬀect the performance can
be identiﬁed.
Recording of the existing performance of the WMS To get a clear im-
pression of the performance of a WMS all functions and the related business
processes and procedures are analyzed as well as the main response times
(mask structure, database access, batch calculation, etc.).
Documentation of the interfaces to superordinate (ERP, MIS, etc.)
and subordinate (WCS, MFC, etc.) systems When the interfaces be-
tween WMS and superordinate and subordinate systems is documented the
complete data ﬂow of the WMS is recorded. This documentation includes
the type and number of external systems, the used protocols as well as the
3 A business process is a series of activities covering diﬀerent functions which
creates a value for the customers and the company.

286
8. Realization of Warehouse Management Systems
transmitted input and output data, the storage location for master data and
the hierarchical design of data and information ﬂows.
Description of the structure of relevant data The description of the
structure of relevant data (e.g., article number, order number, batch, etc.)
gives a complete overview over the structure of all important data, objects
and number ranges like article master data, serial number, number of the
loading aid, etc. (cf. Table 2.13, p. 57).
The aim of the as-is analysis is the continuous recording and description of
all warehouse-related processes and systems.
8.1.2 Weak-point analysis
During a weak-point analysis all data of the as-is analysis regarding potentials
for improvement are studied while the weak points are divided according to
the work steps deﬁned for the as-is analysis. Weak points are, for example:
Business processes and information ﬂow in the warehouse By means
of the process chain analysis4 (PCA) weak points can be identiﬁed within a
business process (e.g., inconsistent processes for nearly identical tasks or no
deﬁned processes for exceptional cases) and the information ﬂow (e.g., media
breaks).
Scope of performance of the WMS The WMS does not have the capacity
required to ensure the smooth operation (e.g., no support with regard to the
order sequence (batch optimization) by the WMS).
Interfaces to subordinate and superordinate systems Incomplete de-
scriptions of interfaces recorded during the as-is analysis (e.g., incomplete
description of the ERP interface).
Structure of relevant data The structure of the existing number ranges
corresponds no longer to the actual requirements or needed number ranges
are not available in the WMS (e.g., a serial number for tracking, lack of a
corresponding data ﬁeld in the WMS).
The aim of the weak-point analysis is to identify all weak points and to derive
potentials for improvement.
4 A process chain can be deﬁned as a coordinated, i.e., process-oriented, sequence
of single sub-processes (process chain elements). At ﬁrst, the relevant process
chains are recorded and analyzed with regard to their potentials (e.g., reduction
of time and costs). ([45]; [46], p.162ﬀ)

8.2 Preparation of the tender documents
287
8.1.3 Development of a target concept
Before the target concept is developed it has to be decided whether the
existing WMS should be replaced or not. In addition to the improvement
potentials this decision should also be based on following aspects:
– Economic situation of the company
– Strategic orientation of the company
– Prognoses (e.g., macroeconomic, branch-speciﬁc, etc.)
– Feasibility study and risk analysis5
If it is decided to replace the existing WMS by a new one a target concept
is developed. This concept is based on the results of the as-is analysis and
the weak-point analysis and deﬁnes the requirements on a new WMS under
consideration of the improvement potentials. According to the classiﬁcation
set up by the weak-point analysis, the requirements are as follows:
Business processes and information ﬂow in the warehouse All busi-
ness processes concerning the warehouse are clearly deﬁned. The information
ﬂow and the use of documents are documented completely.
Scope of performance of the WMS The capacities of the WMS (functions
and related business processes and procedures) complete meet the actual and
planned requirements.
Interfaces to subordinate and superordinate systems The complete
data exchange of the WMS is documented as well as all included external
systems, the used protocols and the transmitted data. Furthermore, it is
clearly deﬁned which system has which date as master date.
Structure of the relevant data All required data, objects and number
ranges are completely deﬁned (cf. Table 2.13 (p. 57) and Table 8.2).
Finally, a set-up schedule is prepared for the target concept which shows the
rough milestones and the required time (cf. Table 8.3).
8.2 Preparation of the tender documents
During the project phase is performance speciﬁcations, technical speciﬁca-
tion and call for tenders the elaborated target concept is formally written
down under consideration of valid standards, guidelines and laws as well as
company-speciﬁc regulations. The goal of this project phase is the prepara-
tion of tender documents.
5 The aim of the risk analysis is to identify and evaluate as early as possible
potential internal and external project risks.

8.2.1 Deﬁnition of the key performance indicators
In the performance catalogue the key performance indicators
(KPI) are
listed, for example:
– Orders, items, grips per time interval (day / week / month)
– Item, grips per article / assortment / client
– Orders, volumes, weight per customer / type of shipment
– etc.
To avoid an under-dimensioning of the WMS the KPIs have also to con-
sider long-term developments (e.g., extension of the assortment or introduc-
tion of performance-related wages for pickers) in addition to current require-
ments. The KPI deﬁne the requirements on a new WMS and are an important
part of the tender documents.

8.2.2 Preparation of the technical speciﬁcations
Another important part of the tender documents are the technical speciﬁca-
tions:
“The technical speciﬁcations of a project summarize the requirements
on the system to be developed, in this case the program/program
system. This requires:
– a feasibility study and
– an extensive analysis of the risks which occur or may occur during
the development” ([63], p. L-1).
The main aspects for the preparation of a WMS requirement speciﬁcation
are ([6], p. 63):
Task The requirement speciﬁcation describes in detail all technical require-
ments which have to be met by the WMS from the customer’s point of
view.
Addressees The usual recipients of the technical speciﬁcations are the mar-
keting experts of the WMS provider and the potential project manager
as well as the application specialists.
Content The problem to be solved, not the solution, is described on suﬃ-
ciently high abstraction level (WHAT and HOW).
Form A clear numbering of the single requirements makes it easier, for ex-
ample, to compare the oﬀers and prepare the functional speciﬁcations

290
8. Realization of Warehouse Management Systems
Time The technical speciﬁcations are the ﬁrst formal document describing
the main requirements on the WMS.
Scope Since the speciﬁcations focus on the fundamental requirements they
can be limited to a few pages.
The above-mentioned aspects result in the following rough scheme:
A) Basics (Short, unfunctional description of the project)
– Task
General strategic description of the task (e.g., replacement of the ex-
isting WMS by a new one).
– Reasons
Reasons and necessities of the tasks (e.g., insuﬃcient capacity of the
existing WMS to meet all warehouse requirements).
– Project target
General description of the project target (e.g., functional support of all
warehouse activities by a new WMS whereas the use must be able to
parameterize this system to future events.). The planned key require-
ment parameters are also listed.
– Project environment
Short description of the environment (e.g., headquarters with produc-
tion and intermediate warehouse of the company in city A, distribution
centers in the cities B and C).
B) Scope of functions (description of all functions)
– Limitation to ERP and MFC and other software
– Functions
List and description of all indispensable functions and services (e.g.,
batch capability).
– Optional functions
List and description of all functions and services (e.g., online language
switch without renewed login) which would help to operate the ware-
house but are not absolutely necessary (e.g., because of increasing
costs).
– Special functions
List and description of all functions and services which are not related
to the daily warehouse operation but are necessary for its administra-
tion (e.g., compatibility/upgradability: The user can represent other
warehouses in the WMS without support from the WMS provider).
Another special function other than the representation of uncommon
functions is the description of data to be transferred from the WMS
The content of this exemplarily requirements speciﬁcations for the choice
of a WMS is represented in the form of a directory (cf.Fig. 8.1). The following
standards and guidelines should be considered while preparing a requirement

– VDI/VDE 3694 (technical speciﬁcations for automation systems)
– VDI 3969 (WMS interfaces to superordinate systems)
– DIN ISO 9126 (Software quality characteristics)
In addition to the above-mentioned standards and guidelines the following
standards should be considered when deﬁning the availability:
– VDI 4004 Sheet 4 (Reliability parameter - availability parameter)
– VDI 3649 (Use of the availability calculation for conveyors and warehouse
facilities)
– VDI 3581 Draft (Availability of transport and warehouse facilities as well
as of their sub-systems and elements)
As a conclusion it can be said that the technical speciﬁcations should be
structured sensibly. Oﬀers should refer directly to the technical speciﬁcations.
8.2.3 Completion of the tender documents
The tender documents are completed among others by the following points:
– List of the general purchasing conditions
– Addition of a secrecy agreement
– Information about possible penalties (also: right to amendment)
– Provision of a binding template for the structure of the oﬀer
– A binding template for the price list (cf. Table 8.4).

8.3 The placement of an order
293
8.3 The placement of an order
Before an order is placed the providers have to be preselected, the tender
documents have to be sent and, if required, the oﬀers have to be presented.
8.3.1 Preselection of providers
To prepare for the preselection of providers and to compare the oﬀers the
technical speciﬁcations have to divided into the following criteria:
– Criteria which are indispensable for the smooth operation of the warehouse,
e.g., multi-client capability for logistic service providers, become exclusion
criteria: If this requirement is not met by the product of the WMS provider
the product is immediately excluded from the selection process.
– Criteria which support the operation but are not indispensable become
so-called optional criteria: This function supports the operation but if it is
not oﬀered this WMS is not automatically excluded.
The list of oﬀers to be compared can be reduced drastically by addressing
only providers who meet the minimum requirements (the so-called qualiﬁed
sending of tender documents). An example of a checklist for these minimum
requirements is shown in Table 8.5.
The preselection of WMS providers is supported by a database mentioned
in [74]. Table 8.6 shows the four-step process with the aim to generate a list
of providers which meet the requirements as basis for the qualiﬁed mailing
of the tender documents.
8.3.2 Comparison of oﬀers
Since WMS providers do not always oﬀer the performance of the functions
described in the technical speciﬁcations, but those covered by the WMS, the
incoming oﬀers have to be compared according to the checklist shown in
Table 8.7.
Each oﬀer is tested systematically, which in most cases leads to questions
which have to be cleared. For this purpose, it may be necessary to extend or
detail the oﬀer at hand. Table 8.8 and 8.9 show examples of the structure of
a comparison of oﬀers.
8.3.3 Oﬀer presentation
Generally, providers or oﬀers cannot directly be evaluated by a direct nu-
merical comparison, and this method would not be adequate for the choice
of a WMS. A meeting of customer and consignee provides further helpful
information, e.g., in the form of an oﬀer presentation.

Table 8.5. Checklist minimum requirements
Which kind of warehouse projects should the provider have carried out?
E.g.,
• Automatic mini-load warehouse
• manual container / small parts warehouse
For which kind of special goods should the provider have carried out
projects? E.g.,
• Piece goods
• Coil
• Long goods
• Bulk goods
For which kind of warehouses should the provider have carried out projects?
E.g.,
• Order-picking warehouse
• Bonded warehouse
• Cold store
• Hazardous goods warehouse
• Multiple warehouse: central warehouse with regional stores
Is a software required which is suitable for shippers?
Is a software required which is suitable for parcel services?
Is a software required which is suitable for logistic service providers?
Is a batch management required?
Is a serial number management required?
Should the system by multi-client capable?
Should the system be a Mehrlager?
Should the dock / yard management be supported by the WMS?
...
This gives the WMS provider the opportunity to personally present his
services as well as the excellence of his product and his company. Further-
more, the procedure/methodology or the project schedule for the introduc-
tion of a WMS can be discussed, and the customer has the possibility to clear
unanswered questions. The results and ﬁndings of this oﬀer presentation are
recorded in the form of a protocol.
On the customer’s side the responsible decision-makers, the operative
warehouse staﬀand the project manager (of the customer) should attend
this presentation while on the provider’s side at least the responsible market-
ing staﬀthe potential project manager (of the consignee) should be present.
A standardized procedure makes it easier to compare and evaluate the
presentations of all WMS providers, i.e.:

Shortlist
The system generates a list of all products which
meet the deﬁned exclusion criteria.
3.
Weighting
The complete data stock is divided into function
groups which can be weighted individually by means
of the rough weighting. Additionally, all questions
and answers can be weighted explicitly up to 1000
single aspects in the scope of the detailed weighting.
With this detailed weighting the user can exactly
specify his/her requirements.
4.
Result
As a result the user gets a list of all eligible products
with the degree of performance of the superordinate
function groups. Furthermore, the actual answers of
the providers concerning each function group can be
viewed.

A) Each participating member of the customer’s staﬀacquaints himself with
the functions stated in the oﬀer; this makes it easier to complete the
evaluation sheet (Table 8.10) during the presentation.
B) Each participant makes a short and precise remark (e.g.: Requirements
are met; requirements are not understood; requirements not mentioned;
unacceptable, etc.) about his personal impression of the functions in the
column “Status oﬀer” of the evaluation sheet Table 8.10
It is recommended to complete the evaluation sheet (Table 8.10) as fol-
lows:
A) There is one evaluation sheet for each bidder.
B) In the column “Status oﬀer” the evaluations of the functions — based
on the oﬀer — are listed which have been made during the preparation
of the presentation.
C) During the oﬀer presentation each participant enters his personal impres-
sion into the column “Comment”.
D) A short and precise remark about the personal impression during the
oﬀer presentation in the column “Status presentation”.
E) Finally, each function is evaluated according to the school mark principle
in the column “Value”.
The oﬀer presentation has the aim to clear all unanswered questions of
the customer as well as the WMS provider.

of an application-speciﬁc solution.
8.3.4 Selection of a provider
All ﬁndings gathered during the presentations are used to evaluate the oﬀer.
After the ﬁnal evaluation of all oﬀers, the providers are listed according to
their priority. Intensive negotiations can be started with bidder 1. If these
negotiations fail (e.g., for cost reasons) negotiations with bidder 2 follow,
etc. In the end that WMS provider has to be chosen who will provide and
implement the new WMS system.
8.4 Implementation
During the implementation the requirement speciﬁcations are prepared and
the system is implemented supported by a quality assurance.
8.4.1 Preparation of the technical speciﬁcations
The requirement speciﬁcations describe how the technical speciﬁcations are
fulﬁlled. It sets the basis for all activities during the implementation and
should be an integrated part of the agreement between customer and con-
signee.

“The requirement speciﬁcations mainly describe how the tasks spec-
iﬁed in the technical speciﬁcations have to be solved. It describes
the performance of the system to be developed and speciﬁes how
and by which means the tasks have to be solved. Before this back-
ground the requirement speciﬁcations sets the basis for the ac-
ceptance....Customer and consignee shall prepare a performance
speciﬁcation based on the technical speciﬁcations as basis for the
agreement...”([63], p. L-1).
When the provider and the customer communicate continuously during
the preparation of the requirement speciﬁcations unclear terms can be deﬁned
and summarized in a glossary. Thus, diﬀerent interpretations of the speciﬁed
performances can be minimized what allows for a more exact implementation.
“The requirement speciﬁcations are a reﬁnement of the technical
speciﬁcations.... Based on the requirement speciﬁcations and the glos-

8.4 Implementation
299
sary a formal product model is developed which has to be specify the
requirements completely, consistently and clearly” ([6], p. 100).
The aspects of the requirement speciﬁcations principally equal that of
the technical speciﬁcations (cf. section 8.2.2) plus the complete, consistent
and unambiguous description of the fulﬁlment of the requirements deﬁned in
the technical speciﬁcations. Should new unpredictable ﬁndings occur during
the implementation, these should be integrated into the requirement speciﬁ-
cations with the agreement of the customer responsible consignee.
The consolidation of the following standards and guidelines facilitates
the preparation of the requirement speciﬁcations and their observance may
become part of the contract, if necessary:
– VDI 2519 (Procedure during the preparation of the requirement speciﬁca-
tions)
– VDI/VDE 3694 (requirement speciﬁcations for use in automation systems)
– ANSI/IEEE 830-1998 (SRS Software Requirements Speciﬁcations)
The following rough scheme of a performance speciﬁcation includes the
main requirements:
– Basics (short, unfunctional project description)
– Tasks
Basic (business) description of the tasks, e.g., replacement of the existing
WMS by a new WMS.
– Reasons
Reasons and necessities leading to the task, e.g., new activities in the
warehouse can no longer be performed by the old system
– Project goals
General description of the project goal, e.g., functional support of all
warehouse activities by a new WMS whereas this WMS has to be ad-
justable by the user to future events. The performance parameter have
also to be stated.
– Project environment
Short description of the environment, e.g., headquarters with produc-
tion and intermediate warehouse of the company in city A, distribution
centers in the cities B and C.
– Time schedule
Mention of all milestones with key dates.
– Scope of functions (description of all functions)
– Delimination to ERP and MFC and other software: Positioning of the
WMS within the system landscape.
– Functions: List and description of all functions and services.
– Interfaces: Description of the necessary interfaces and protocols.
– Data transfer: Type and method of the data transfer with information
about the data to be transferred.

300
8. Realization of Warehouse Management Systems
– Training (date, place and volume as well as target group of each single
training)
– Start-up (date and procedure of the start-up)
– Acceptance (form and scope of the acceptance with precisely deﬁned perfor-
mance key values and a list of performances to be provided by the customer
and the consignee)
It is the aim of this project phase to exactly and unambiguously deﬁne
all requirements (services, activities and functions) including their scheduling
which are necessary to achieve the project goal. The requirement speciﬁca-
tions are approved by the customer and it is binding for both parties as part
of the contract.
8.4.2 Realization
During the realization the tasks deﬁned in the requirement and technical
speciﬁcations are fulﬁlled to complete the product. It depends on the kind of
WMS:
– Implementation (Installation of the software on the provided hardware)
– Customizing (Adaptation to the existing interfaces and activation of the
necessary program modules)
– Parameterization (Adaptation of the software to the customer requirements
by means of parameter and switches)
– Individual programming (Programming of individual functions)
All changes of the technical and requirement speciﬁcations which occur
during the realization have to be documented and communicated between
customer and consignee. Possible reasons for these changes may be new ﬁnd-
ings (e.g., from simulation), missing topics in the technical and the require-
ment speciﬁcations or new requirements (e.g., additional statistical informa-
tion requests). The documentation should include, among others:
– Which service/function drops out; is added; is altered?
– This leads to which cost-eﬀective changes?
– This leads to which time eﬀects (scheduling of project milestones)?
– Which priority has this change? Has it to be completed before the start-up?
When the change can be performed later by when has it to be performed
at the latest?
– Does the change have any eﬀect on the acceptance?
A documentation of changes avoids disputes during the acceptance be-
cause the diﬀerences between the functions described in the technical and
the requirement speciﬁcations and the implemented functions can clearly be
demonstrated.

8.5 Start-up
301
8.4.3 Project management / Quality assurance
During the realization the usual controlling measures should be taken in the
scope of a supporting project management:
Supervision of the milestones Has the time schedule of the single milestones
been observed, are there project backlogs or is the total lead time in
danger because of delays on the critical path?
Resource control Are eﬃcient resources available? Would an increase in re-
sources signiﬁcantly improve the productivity? Has the the planned bud-
get kept?
Furthermore, the following quality assurance measures have to be consid-
ered as part of the quality management:
– Quality management (QM) includes
“all activities of the management which deﬁne the quality policy, goals
and responsibilities and realize it in the scope of the quality man-
agement system by planning, controlling, assuring and improving the
quality”[23].
– The general term QA describes
“all planned and systematic activities which are realized within the
quality management system and are presented as required to create
an adequate trust into the ability of the unit to fulﬁll the quality
requirements”[23].
This step focuses on the fulﬁlment of the function deﬁned in the require-
ment speciﬁcations within a given period of time with the planned resources
and in the desired quality.
8.5 Start-up
The start-up consists of the test phase with the oﬄine performance tests,
the changeover from the existing to the new WMS and the parallel training
courses. When the start-up has been ﬁnished successfully the new WMS is
released for the production process.
8.5.1 Test phase
Prior to the test phase the old data stocks (e.g., article master data, ware-
house movement protocols, etc.) have to be transferred. It may be necessary
to develop, for example, special import programs for this purpose. The data
transfer may be very time-consuming so that it should be planned in good
time, especially when large data stocks have to be transferred.

302
8. Realization of Warehouse Management Systems
During the test phase the new WMS is tested under laboratory conditions
but with real data: The orders submitted by the WMS are not really exe-
cuted by the picker but in a simulation (e.g., a test program directly enters
the picked quantity into the database). On the one hand, the used data should
reﬂect the current requirements on the other hand the client and server soft-
ware should prove in oﬄine tests that the system is able to cope with the
peak loads of the last months as well as projected, future loads. If a material
ﬂow is simulated the software and simulation data have to be consistent.
8.5.2 Changeover from old to new WMS
The changeover from the old to the new WMS can be made in two ways:
Parallel operation During the parallel operation or parallel run [6] both sys-
tem run simultaneously whereas at ﬁrst only the old WMS is active.
Then, the new system is activated and tested section by section and suc-
cessively replaces the old system. This method is very safe because in
case of failures the old system can be used. A disadvantage, however, is
the high cost for the operation of two systems and the general problems
which arise during the parallel operation of two systems.
Direct changeover In case of a direct changeover the old WMS is directly
replace by a new one. The old system is switched oﬀand the new one im-
mediately starts to work. Usually, the direct changeover is chosen when
the transition period is limited for business reasons, e.g., during the com-
pany holidays or outside the seasonal business. An advantage of the di-
rect changeover are the low costs. However, it may come to considerable
start-up problems or data inconsistencies.
8.5.3 Training
The early and careful training of the staﬀis of great importance so that the
participating employees have to be set free. An ill-prepared training, above all
after work hours or on weekends, may have a negative eﬀect on the readiness
of the staﬀto accept the new system. At the end of this project phase trained
members of the customer’s staﬀare able to manage and control the warehouse
supported by the new WMS under consideration of the functions described
in the technical and requirement speciﬁcations and to eliminate all failures
which occurred during the start-up.
8.6 Acceptance
During the acceptance the functions and response times described in the
technical and requirement speciﬁcations are controlled, failures are simulated
and emergency strategies are checked. Acceptance is based on the German
guidelines VDI 39777E and 3979 and concluded by the acceptance certiﬁcate.

8.6 Acceptance
303
“Acceptance Legally deﬁned procedure where the customer ac-
cepts the product. The accepted product becomes the property of
the customer”([6], p. 1098).
8.6.1 Performance test
The performance test with the function test of the main parts and availability
test comprises the uninterrupted operation (mostly over several days) under
real conditions and full load. When the operation has to be stopped due to
failures the test has to be repeated.
During the function test at ﬁrst, it is checked if all functions described in
the requirement speciﬁcations exist. Then, the proper function of each single
element is tested individually. Special attention should be given to functions
which deviate from the standard6:
– Does the function exist?
– Does the function meet the requirements?
Typical performance key values which are determined during the test are
the duration of the mask buildup on the screen, the duration of a database ac-
cess (e.g., display of master data and statistics) and the time for a database
request (e.g., open picking orders) as well as the reporting time (e.g., ar-
ticle per client per month). Furthermore, the response times to the exter-
nal/mobile terminals (e.g., stacker terminals) have to be recorded according
to VDI guideline 3649.
8.6.2 Failure simulation and emergency strategies
A failure simulation simulates extraordinary situations as described in the
requirement speciﬁcations:
– System behavior in case of an interrupted communication with the host
computer
– Consequences of a power breakdown
– Strategy check (Which strategy applies when an article has to be retrieved
but the bin is empty? How does the system react when an article is going
to be stored in the wrong area, e.g., frozen goods in the hazardous goods
area?)
– Instruction and documentation check (What has to be done in case of an
emergency?)
– etc.
6 Functions deviating from the standard are those functions which have been im-
plemented individually for the project and have not be adapted to the project
by parameters or customizing.

304
8. Realization of Warehouse Management Systems
In failure simulation adequate emergency strategies which maintain the
operation are of special importance. The tests should also include the restora-
tion of data and the synchronization of the diﬀerent sub-systems (e.g., WMS
and ERP) after a breakdown.
All criteria, services and availabilities which are described in the require-
ment speciﬁcations and which are relevant for the acceptance are listed in
the transfer protocol.
8.6.3 Formal acceptance
The single positions are accepted one after the other and signed by the cus-
tomer and the consignee. Each fulﬁlment, each fault and each deviation is
stated in the protocol. In case of faults and deviations it is discussed to which
of the four fault categories they belong:
– The warehouse cannot be operated due to the fault or the functional de-
viance from the requirement speciﬁcation (e.g., the safety light barrier or
the control of the rack feeder do not work).
– There is only an expensive alternative to the faulty or deviating function
(e.g., the scanner at the goods receipt does not work and each article has
to be scanned manually).
– There is an acceptable alternative for a faulty or deviating function (e.g.,
some of the data are not recorded by the WMS during the automatic
order acceptance by the host which has to be carried out twice a day.
The operator has to check the order acceptance and arrange for a renewed
input, if necessary).
– A fault or deviation does not limit the operation of the system (e.g., the
print format of the supply note in the goods issue does not exactly meet
the speciﬁcations).
They have the following eﬀects on the acceptance and the decisions about
the implementation of the WMS:
Category 1 No acceptance, no putting into operation.
Category 2 Clariﬁcation who has to bear possible additional costs incurred
by the customer (e.g., additional staﬀhas to be employed until elimina-
tion of the fault). It can only be decided from case to case if parts of the
system are accepted with restraints and the WMS is put into operation.
Category 3 The system is accepted with restraints and can be put into op-
eration. The unﬁlled points have to be settled with highest priority.
Category 4 The system is accepted with restraints and can be put into oper-
ation. The fulﬁlment of the unsettled points has to be scheduled by the
customer and the consignee.
Minor deviations should not prevent the commissioning of the system.
It has to be deﬁned, however, up to when the fault or deviation has to be

8.6 Acceptance
305
eliminated. If the number of faults of the categories 3 or 4 gets too high an
acceptance should be reconsidered. The categories also imply the priority of
the fault elimination.
The ﬁnal formal acceptance of the total system according to § 12 VOB,
part B and VDMA follows the faultless, unobjected performance test which
has to be completed at least 3 months after the start-up. All shortcomings
stated in the handover certiﬁcate have to be eliminated prior to the accep-
tance which has to be requested in writing by the consignee.
If there is no other legal agreement, the system is accepted solely by
the written certiﬁcate of the customer; it is replaced neither by an earlier
use, start-up or acceptance by an authority nor by the consignee’s notice of
completion.
The customer as well as the consignee have to deploy suﬃcient material
and qualiﬁed staﬀfor the acceptance and tests to guarantee for the smooth
performance of the stated activities. In addition to this, they have to appoint
qualiﬁed contact persons.
The acceptance generally constitutes the transfer of risks from the con-
signee to the customer and the start of the contractually agreed warranty
period.
With the acceptance the project implementation of warehouse manage-
ment systems is ﬁnished. All guaranteed features have been checked, the fa-
cilities meet the requirements, the acceptance certiﬁcate has no faults or gaps
and has been signed by both contract parties. The WMS goes into service.

9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of
myWMS
A large variety of diﬀerent warehouse management systems are available on
the market which diﬀer with regard to
– their scope of functions,
– their interfaces,
– the required hardware,
– the required operating system,
– the operating concept
and to many other features as well as, last but not least, regarding the in-
vestment costs. Often, with his decision for a certain WMS, the warehouse
owner binds himself for a long time to the provider and depends on him for
the extension of functions and interfaces and the exchange of hardware.
A modular and open warehouse management system which is programmed
in a widely accepted language independent of the hardware and operating sys-
tems improves the compatibility to third-party products and components and
ensures the eﬃcient adjustment to the rapidly changing market conditions.
Such a comprehensive WMS solution was developed at the Fraunhofer
IML1 with the name myWMS. This system is a framework based on the
principles of a modular WMS. It provides a number of software modules and
regulations for the software-related construction supporting a WMS.
In this chapter, a general data model is ﬁrst described which can be found
in many warehouse management systems and sets the basis for myWMS. This
discussion is followed by the description of a classical WMS implementation
and ﬁnally the elementary structures of myWMS are presented and demon-
strated at a practical example.
9.1 Data model
The core of each WMS is a data model which sets the basis for the man-
agement of the diﬀerent data stocks and data ﬂows which occur during the
operation of a warehouse. This data model represents the relevant practical
parts in the form of software structures (data structures). The ﬁrst modelling

step is the analysis of all WMS relevant data, their structures and formal
description. Then, their interrelations have to be studied and speciﬁed.
9.1.1 Data container of the model

Figure 9.1. The data model of a warehouse management system with the adjacent
systems. The dotted line separates the WMS from its environment. The entries in
the data containers show the terms used in myWMS.
The exact data contents of a container does not necessarily have to be
speciﬁed here so that, for example, the container 1c in Fig. 9.1, which repre-
sents the customer, may only hold a customer number or detailed customer
data like surname, name, delivery address, billing address, telephone number
and payment behavior. They just have to exist in the model; their meaning
has to be deﬁned and they have to represent reality.
– Supplier: The container 1a holds the supplier data
– Manufacturer: The container 1b holds data about the manufacturers of
single articles

9.1 Data model
309
– Customer: The container 1c holds data about customers which are sup-
plied via this warehouse
– Article group: Articles can be grouped within a warehouse according to
diﬀerent criteria. This is achieved by means of container 2.
The ﬁrst three containers have been numbered with 1a, 1b and 1c. Since
a supplier may also be a customer or a manufacturer a supplier (or vice
versa), it would make sense to combine the containers 1a, 1b and 1c into one
container which represents a legal person to avoid redundant data stocks.
A WMS does not need detailed information about this person. Therefore,
in Fig. 9.1, it is located outside the dotted line like the container for article
groups.
Data containers which are relevant for a WMS and are required by exter-
nal systems (e.g., personnel management, quality assurance and goods econ-
omy) (cf. section 9.1.3) are described in the following. The terms used in the
diagram are generally used throughout the myWMS project (cf section 9.3).
– Supply: A supply is an outgoing order (and possibly its execution) of
articles for the warehouse.
– ItemData: Container 4 holds the meta data for the articles. The ItemData
describe the characteristics of the articles and not the pick-up unit in the
warehouse which is associated with a serial number. They above all include
data which are required for the correct storage and movement such as
preference zone (A, B, or C), allowed light and temperature range, number
of pick-up units per pallet or the hazardous goods category and weight (cf.
section 2.4).
– Order: Container 5 holds incoming orders (customer orders) and is similar
to the container Supply where just the customer and the supplier side are
swapped.
– Worker This container holds data about the warehouse staﬀ, e.g., of pick-
ers. Above all information about the skills of workers and their authoriza-
tion to operate certain machines - e.g., fork lift trucks - are important in a
warehouse.
– LocationCategory: Locations can be grouped in container 12 where they
can be allocated to a zone or storage group or categorized otherwise.
– OrderChain: Container 13 holds data about the single movements of the
loading aids between the bin locations. It can also be seen as a kind of
protocol.
The last container group is of relevance only within a WMS.
– StockUnit: Container 6 holds the data for those articles the meta data
of which can be accessed via container 4 (ItemData). A device with a
serial number substantiates its meta date. The TV set “look-out” with
the serial number 405432100002, for example, is entered into the container
StockUnit whereas in the container ItemData all data of the model

310
9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
“Look-out” are described. Here, the concrete model only aﬀects the stock.
Similar approaches are also used in systems without serial numbers.
– StockUnitCategory: Here, concrete stock units can be built, for example
by building batches or tour numbers of the supplier.
– UnitLoad: Container 9 describes the unit load which may hold stock units.
A unit load may be loaded with mixed or single-type articles.
– LoadHandler: The load handler is used for the physical transport and for
this purpose temporarily has to take up unit loads. Thus, a load handler
is a “bin location” for a short time.
– Location: In container 11 the bin locations are recorded. A location may
be occupied or free. In addition, a blocking mark can be set like for all
other containers (cf. section 2.2).
The containers described up to now represent the typical warehouse data.
Further containers can be added to this model, e.g., a container for the group-
ing of unit loads to classify unit loads with partially similar characteristics.
This model is based on a warehouse with few types of unit loads, as it pre-
vails in practice, and represents the diﬀerences in an attribute of the container
UnitLoad. A real data model does not necessarily use all containers.
9.1.2 Data interrelations
While the containers in Fig. 9.1 describe the data of a WMS, the lines point
out their interrelations. Several kinds of uni- or bilateral relations are possible
and their multiplicity is marked by numbers or characters at the end of the
connecting line.
– A 0 means that there is no relation in that direction. A 0 does not have to
be shown to simplify the presentation. Relations with a 0 at both ends are
called empty relations, hold no information and are not drawn.
– A 1 at one end of a connecting line shows that at this end exactly one
element of the container is assigned to the container at the other side.
For example, a telephone number is related to exactly one legal person
(customer, manufacturer or supplier).
– An n at an end of a connecting line indicates that there are a maximum of
up to n relations to this side. For example, a legal person may have several
telephone numbers but there may also be none.
In case of a multiple relation in both directions, one side is marked with
n and the other with m to indicate that the multiplicity may be diﬀerent.
For example, a relation
n
m between the manufacturer and the supplier
container could be shown if it is relevant. This relation could show that
a manufacturer uses the services of n suppliers, while a supplier sells the
products of m manufacturers. A relation line n
m , thus, is the symbolic
combination of a
n
0 and a
0
m line.

9.1 Data model

In the following, all relation lines shown in Fig. 9.1 are listed and described
in a table. The numbers of the respective containers are connected by one of
the lines mentioned above and marked with a name.
– ( 1a
1
n
6 ) Delivery:
This relation describes the delivery of ar-
ticles whereas a supplier delivers several articles (n ≥0), but one article
exactly belongs to the delivery of one supplier. Reasonable relations cannot
be diﬀerentiated from unreasonable ones with the data model alone. This
relation, for example, allows empty deliveries but also deliveries without
articles. The superordinate logic has to ensure that a supply contains at
least one article.
– ( 1a
1
n
3 ) Order (or notiﬁcation): This relation represents an
order (or a notiﬁcation). An order (a notiﬁcation) is assigned to exactly one
supplier while a supplier may be allocated to several orders (notiﬁcations)
– ( 1a
m
n
4 ) Catalogue: The catalogue of a supplier contains the
meta data of diﬀerent articles but an article may also be bought from
diﬀerent suppliers.
– ( 1b

n
4 ) Item list: An article which is represented by its meta
data is manufactured by exactly one manufacturer who may, however, have
several articles in his assortment.
– ( 1c

n
4 ) Purchasing behavior: The purchasing behavior of a
customer can be described by a relation between item data and customer.
A customer may buy diﬀerent articles and an article may be bought by
diﬀerent customers.
– ( 1c

n
5 ) Order: A customer may submit diﬀerent orders during
the time but an order is always assigned to exactly one customer.
– ( 1c

n
6 ) Serial number tracking:
With this relation the
delivered article can be traced back to the customer and vice versa. A
warranty claim, for example, can be settled by tracking the relation starting
from delivery (to the supplier). This relation also closes the chain for a
recall.
– ( 2
m
n
4 ) Goods classiﬁcation: The relation goods classiﬁca-
tion combines the meta data of articles with the same characteristics. This
relation is of interest mainly in shop or merchandize management systems.
– ( 3

n
4 ) Storage order: A delivery (or notiﬁcation) initiates
a storage order which is related to a quantity of articles. A delivery is not
only related to the article itself but also to its item data.
– ( 4

n
4 ) Mixed-storage prohibition: This relation is neces-
sary because some articles must not be stored together (cf. Chapter 2).
– ( 4

a quantity of articles which is described by this relation to the respective
meta data.

7 ) Article classiﬁcation:
An article may belong to
several categories and each category contains a variety of articles.

With this relation the articles are assigned to
the unit loads. An article can be on just one unit load2, but this can hold
several articles.

– ( 11

13 ) Transport destination: These relations all start from
one transport order and are unilateral. The relation work order assigns
just one worker to the transport order, e.g., a stacker driver for a driving
order or a picker for a picking order. In a fully automatic warehouse the
relation work order describes the responsibilities. The relation transport
object indicates which unit load is moved while the relations transport
medium indicates the relation to the executing load handler. The relations
transport source and transport destination are self-descriptive.
– ( 9
n

11 ) Bin occupation:
Each unit load has to be assigned
to exactly one bin. A storage bin may take up several unit loads.
– ( 10
m
n
11 ) Working area:
A certain bin location may be ac-
cessed by several machines, but one load handler may also serve several
bin locations.
– ( 11
m
n
12 ) Zoning:
Diﬀerent locations can be grouped in zones
and each zone may consist of many bin locations.
Further relations can be generated, but are seldom required. The model
may be extended, for example, by a n
m relation between worker and load
handler, which informs users about the skills and authorization to operate
certain machines. The respective characteristics then have to be removed
from the container worker.
The existing relations may also appear in another multiplicity, e.g., the
relation working area as a 1
n relation when the bin locations are accessed
by exactly one load handler, e.g., a rack feeder. Similar restrictions may also
be made concerning the article classiﬁcation when the single category is built
by the batch.
The relations may also be interpreted in another way. The relation pur-
chasing behavior, for example, may occur as purchasing prohibition3. If pur-
chasing behavior as well as purchasing prohibition are wanted as a relation
between customer and item master both are shown by a separate line.
2 Articles which are transported or stored without a unit load are assigned to a
“virtual unit load”, which is physically nonexistent.
3 Such a purchasing prohibition for single articles and countries was stipulated,
for example, in the CoCom–list (Coordinating Committee on East-West Trade
Policy).

9.1.3 Interfaces
The containers which in Fig. 9.1 are crossed by the dotted line build the
interface of the WMS. The data in these containers are relevant for the WMS
as well as for the adjacent systems such as
– Personnel management
– Quality assurance,
– Forwarding agencies
– Client management and
– Merchandize management
They can be implemented in two diﬀerent ways: A joint database helps to
avoid redundant data stocks and the related disadvantages (cf. section 7.2).
Alternatively, the principle of multiple data management can be used, i.e.,
the data are stored as copies at diﬀerent locations.
A disadvantage of this method is the high expenditure for the synchro-
nization of data stocks and the short-term infringement of the integrity by
unilateral data changes. Nevertheless, this method is often used in practice
because it can easily be implemented and allows for the intermittent au-
tonomous operation of sub-systems.
Figure 9.2 demonstrates the method of a multiple data management at
the example of the article item data. These data are required by a WMS as
well as a merchandize management system (MMS). In addition to the part
which is commonly used by both systems – shaded in grey in the center of
Fig. 9.2 – the article master also hold speciﬁc data for the WMS and the
MMS.
Only the mutually used part builds the interface and has to be synchro-
nized. Generally, the data are synchronized cyclically in times of low activity,
mainly at night. Other containers with highly dynamical data have to be syn-
chronized much more frequently, in the extreme case even after each change.
9.2 Classical implementation of a WMS
This section describes some aspects of an implementation by means of a
relational database. This method to implement the logical concept of a WMS
is typical for currently oﬀered systems. Because of the suggestive structure
of relational databases and their plausible query language systems can be
implemented within a short time.
9.2.1 Functional structure
A WMS can be implemented in two ways:

Figure 9.2. Implementation of interfaces by a partially redundant data manage-
ment
– Mainframe-based architectures (cf. Fig. 9.3), where the WMS runs on a
central computer with a database server4.
– Client-server systems (cf. Fig. 9.4) which bind distributed work stations
with speciﬁc functions to a database server.
In a mainframe architecture all processes run on the central computer
and are operated at terminals with no WMS functions of their own. In client-
server systems these processes are distributed completely or partially to the
intelligent work stations. The informational tasks are divided as follows:
– Masks can be conﬁgured and data represented locally without database
access, i.e., by a HTML browser.
– Plausibility checks can be carried out by a client. The correct entry of
zip codes or e-mail addresses, for example, can be checked locally. A data
transfer from the client to the server and back is an unnecessary commu-
nication.
– Integrity checks can be carried out locally when they refer completely to
a current operation. For example, when the serial number for an article is
entered it can be checked locally that the ﬁeld for the number of articles
4 The database operations can also be encapsuled by means of an application
server to oﬀer services on a WMS level.

is not unequal 1. The uniqueness of the serial number, however, cannot be
checked locally5.
– Depending on whether data are requested from the database server or not
computations can be made locally or just on the server.
– Generally, database operations have to be carried out on the server with the
exception of distributed databases which are partially realized by clients
(peer-to-peer solution).
In practice, it is not always easy to deﬁne if a system is based on a
mainframe architecture or a client-server solution.
9.2.2 Table structure
The database allows for the structured storage of all data which are necessary
for or generated during the operation. This structuring is facilitated by the
table concept. Generally, each container shown in Fig. 9.1 can be represented
in a database table of its own.
5 Unless a “serial number” consists of parameters which guarantee for uniqueness
like, for example, the millisecond which since 1st January 1970 concatenates with
a primary key describing the input terminal.

Figure 9.4. Example of a client-server architecture
Before the data can be stored, however, each table has to be structured,
i.e., the following storage parameters have to be speciﬁed
– what (which)
– where (which table)
– how (which accuracy)
– whereby (which data type)
It makes sense, for example, to store a telephone number as an integer num-
ber 6 However, the zero as ﬁrst digit of the area code or special symbols like
a plus or a hyphen cannot be stored as an integer data type. For this reason,
a telephone number should be stored as a character string where a suﬃcient
number of characters (accuracy) has to be chosen as possible length.
Logically related data like the ItemData (cf. Fig. 9.1) are entered line by
line into the speciﬁed cells of a table. To use relational databases and tables
the primary keys for the identiﬁcation of data lines have to be assigned in a
deﬁnite way.
A database table ItemData could be structured as shown in Table 9.1. In
this structure the cell photo has a length of 255 characters to enter a URL
(see page 233) for the photo. The database type blob (Binary Large Object)
is one possibility for storing such binary data. The advantage of the URL
compared to the blob is that the storage location for the photo data can be
freely chosen. Furthermore, multiple references can be made and the database

does not have to handle large data volumes. A similar method is to describe
the data in a separate text ﬁle where they can be accessed via a URL. With
regard to internationalized descriptions the URL oﬀers many possibilities to
manage and represent the data.
In Table 9.1 the ﬁeld ID rId deﬁnes a clear rawID as primary key. The
article number could not be used as primary key because it would lead to am-
biguity at least at the implementation of a client warehouse. Present database
systems allow for the automatic generation of primary keys for the single data
sets and thus relieve the programmer.
There is a relation
1
n between ItemData and StockUnit. The Item-
Data may refer to no, one or several StockUnit tables. This relation is deﬁned
by the ﬁeld itemDataId (cf. Table 9.2) that assigns exactly one rId of Item-
Data to each line of StockUnit while an rId of ItemData can appear in several
lines of StockUnit (cf. Fig. 9.5).
The
n
m association between location and locationCategory can only
be built with an auxiliary table, the reference table, also called map table (cf.
Fig. 9.6).
Each line of the reference table connects a rawID of the table location to
a rawID of the table locationCategory and contains a primary key which can
be built from the two rawIDs of the respective line.
Without such a reference table the data stock would be highly redundant
what would lead to additional memory and runtime requirements.

9.2.3 Securing the logical integrity
Fig. 9.6 shows the structure of the database table locationCategory where the
ﬁeld characteristic describes the single zones. The reasonable assignment
of a location to a locationCategory has to be ensured by a logistic integrity.
Depending on the application each location should or has to be assigned to
exactly one zone A, B or C. From the logistical point of view a location must
not be assigned to several zones but may be allocated to a weight category
which is represented by the same ﬁeld.
Alternatively, the contents of locationCategory can be distributed to sev-
eral dedicated database tables. This problem is avoided by a distribution with
only 1
n relations. This would impede a statical structure and additional
categories cannot be generated during operation without having to change
the data model.
Another problem regarding the safe logical integrity is described on page
314. When in the database table stockUnit the ﬁeld serial number is occu-
pied the value in the ﬁeld number has to be 1.
9.2.4 Generation and query of master data
Data stored in a database are accessed and manipulated by the user in a
speciﬁc database language (DML7). Most database systems support SQL8 as
standardized query language. A user has to know the data model to use SQL
for queries and changes of a data stock. The examples describe some typical
database operations carried out in SQL.

A new data set is entered into the table stockUnit withh the following
command where the cell contents are deﬁned by variables. In the example
the stockUnitCount represents a sequence which contains the number of
data sets in the table stockUnit:
insert into stockUnit
(rId, serial number, number, itemDataId)
values
(stockUnitCount.nextVal,’’,11,42);
The names of all articles with a weight fewer than ten weight units can

If all shelves in zone A should be selected this is achieved with the com-
mand:

In the example above the number of selected lines in the reference table
corresponds to the number of bin locations which fulﬁll the desired criterion.

9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
With the function Stored Procedures many relational databases oﬀer the
possibility to store frequent queries on the server together with the transfer
parameters.
9.3 myWMS
The object-oriented programming (OOP) oﬀers many advantages also for
the implementation of a WMS. For this reason often object-oriented pro-
gramming languages9 are used for more advanced systems. This method has
the best eﬀect when not only the programming, but also the analysis and
the design of a software are based on it. The focus does not lie on the rep-
resentation of data structures in a database table, but on an object-oriented
analysis. During this phase of the analysis not only the data and their in-
terrelations are described, but also possible methods referring to these data.
The data are represented in software structures and realized by means of a
OOP later on.
Such an OOP solution for WMS was developed in the project myWMS10.
This section describes the technical concept of myWMS as an example for
the consistent use of the OOP technique in WMS. From now on, knowledge
about object-orientation and Java is required. But owing to the suggestive
structure of this chapter and the chosen examples, the basic principles can be
understood without such know-how. Section 9.4 shows the use of this frame
for the implementation of a simple WMS.
9.3.1 The basic structure of myWMS
Like an operating system, myWMS provides several basic functions and el-
ementary services for WMS applications. It is a platform and, thus, can-
not be operated without speciﬁc applications. myWMS creates well-deﬁned
communication interfaces to external systems and internal interfaces to the
exchangeable modules, the so-called plug-ins, which are speciﬁed by Java
interfaces and allow third parties to integrate own products.
In addition to the pure warehouse management, the myWMS framework
also includes a material ﬂow control. myWMS does not deal with aspects
of merchandize management, production planning and production control
although the framework includes interfaces to such systems.
Since myWMS is not limited to special types of warehouses and logistic
processes, its range of application is wide, from manually operated warehouses
and automatic warehouses to physically distributed warehouses with hetero-
geneous structures. Thanks to suitable plug-ins like routing or optimization
algorithms the system can easily be adapted to existing warehouses.
9 According to the general terminology “object-oriented” is abbreviated with OOP.

Figure 9.7. As intersection of functions and data structures the core system sim-
pliﬁes and idealizes diﬀerent types of warehouses
A plug-in has to be bound to a process – later called kernel. A kernel
provides basic functions independent of the type of warehouse (cf. Fig. 9.7).
myWMS oﬀers a library for frequently used plug-ins and the user can option-
ally use the original or a modiﬁed version or develop his own plug-ins. Thus,
a system can have the USP of the user but still beneﬁt from the advantages
of a standardized system.
A modular and up-gradable warehouse management system, which is not
yet specialized for a certain application, should at least meet the following
requirements:
– Independent of platforms: A programming language which allows for the
generation of portable codes assures that the system runs on diﬀerent com-
puter architectures and operating systems.
– Distributability: It should be possible to concurrently run the modules of
a WMS on several cooperating computers. The material ﬂow control, for
example, could run on another computer than the warehouse management
system itself. Since the system is independent of a platform it can be op-
erated on heterogenous computer systems.
– Scalability: Increasing requirements, like a growing throughput rate, for ex-
ample, or more clients should be met by a WMS by means like distribution,
adjustment of modules and parametrization.
– Parametrization: A WMS should allow for the continuous parametrization
of its modules. For this purpose the conﬁguration concept should facilitate
the persisting of the parameters.

Figure 9.8. The hierarchical model of myWMS
– Releasability: The long-term constancy of the interfaces is an important
aspect for the selection of a WMS. The basic software can be exchanged
retaining the existing modules and their application-speciﬁc extensions as
these modules can be exchanged retaining the basic software.
– Web-based operation: The system can be operated with any web browser
and is thus independent of platforms. This allows for the integration of the
existing IT-infrastructure.
– Independence: No limitation to certain warehouse types, operating means
or strategies.
– Upgradability: The system can be adapted to the logistic requirements by
generating additional or upgrading existing modules.
myWMS fulﬁlls these requirements by means of the kernel/plug-in tech-
nology, a conceptional distribution, the conﬁguration capability and an im-
plementation in Java. myWMS is based on a three-level hierarchy consisting
of the inventory management, the location management and the material ﬂow
control (cf. Fig. 9.8).
The inventory manager is responsible for the management of item data
and article-related operations independent of the location as well as of avail-
able and existing quantities of stock units (cf. Fig. 9.1).
The location manager manages the current occupancy of the locations by
unit loads as well as the attributes of the locations.
The equipment manager calculates the transport routes, orders the oper-
ating means and supervises the operative execution of the transport orders.

9.3 myWMS
323
Not all systems have to use all three levels. For example, an inventory
and location manager can be operated while the bottom level is replaced
by a separate material ﬂow computer. In a non-automated warehouse the
bottom level, i.e., the equipment manager, may print transport instructions
or control radio terminals.
Since the bottom level is operated separately an independent material ﬂow
computer without a warehouse function can be built on a myWMS basis.
Each level can also be operated in several instances. A multi-client ware-
house, i.e., the provision of several logical warehouse in one warehouse, can be
built, for example, by instantiating the two top levels. By means of a multiple
instantiation of the bottom level a multiple warehouse, i.e., a warehouse with
several physical locations, can be operated. This also allows for the building
of multi-client multiple warehouses.
9.3.2 Business objects
The single levels are responsible for managing the respective data stored in
the business objects. Each business object exactly corresponds to a container
in the data model shown in Fig. 9.1. myWMS includes the following business
objects:
– Supply
– ItemData
– Order
– StockUnit
– StockUnitCategory
– UnitLoad
– LoadHandler
– Location
– LocationCategory
– OrderChain
Thanks to the hierarchical structure single objects can be modelled in de-
tail, e.g., the physical location is deﬁned as StorageLocation and the logical
one as Location. Generally, each logical location has a physical counterpart.
The space on the load take-up of a machine is a physical location without a
logical equivalent (cf. page 310).
The business objects have been generated consequently according to the
OOP principle, i.e., analysis, implementation and test. No attribute can di-
rectly be accessed: All attributes are encapsulated and only accessible by
so-called accessor methods. Each business object communicates in the above-
mentioned way via interfaces. Other methods are encapsulated and not avail-
able.
Business objects can be specialized by inheritage. If new attributes are
added which were unknown or not considered during the implementation they

324
9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
are realized by key-value codes. This method is generally known as the design
pattern property and implemented in Java among others as hashtable. It is
also possible to combine both methods, inheritage and property technique.
The myWMS business object ItemData should be adapted to the cur-
rent application just by derivation because in the basic category only the
attributes itemNumber and name (plain text description) exist, as in every
warehouse11. Real warehouses may need other attributes like the location of
a photo or a minimum inventory (cf. section 2.2). These would then be de-
clared and deﬁned in an ItemData upgraded class together with their accessor
methods. They are unknown to the kernel and are used by other objects or
plug-ins.
For the business object LocationCategory can be reasonable to use prop-
erties because this allows for the dynamical extension of location groups.
The comObject, a category implemented by myWMS, uses both meth-
ods. The basic category provides a protected hash table which is ﬁlled with
every derivation phase. Each derivation provides the corresponding accessor
method.
Adequate business processes have to be modelled and implemented to
ensure the functioning of a WMS. myWMS can be notiﬁed about these busi-
ness processes by the PluginInterface. Another important component is the
SupplyStrategyInterface as an extension of the PluginInterface and serves
the Locations. The coupling of business processes and business objects is
event-driven and based on the Listener concept. The business processes do
not exchange any status information and and are considered as stateless by
myWMS. Typical business processes are
– Storage
– Order-picking
– Retrieval
When a business object is changed all business processes registered as
listeners are notiﬁed. A business process which receives such a message checks
if additional frame conditions are met and, if necessary, performs the next
process step. This may require a change of business objects.
myWMS contains some pre-modelled business processes but generally
they have to be adjusted to the actual logistic requirements.
9.3.3 Kernel concept
The three levels – inventory management, location management and equip-
ment management – consist of at least one IT process, a so-called kernel. A
WMS consists of the kernels of the three levels, the respective plug-ins and
the application extensions. The basic principles of myWMS are:
11 ItemData can also use plug-ins via interfaces, such as ItemDataLockInterface to
manage article blocks.

9.3 myWMS
325
– Logistic orientation: In contrast to universal databases or application
servers myWMS is tailored to the requirements of logistics, especially the
warehouse management.
– Flexibility: Since it is limited to core functions and the use of speciﬁc plug-
ins the system is highly ﬂexible12.
– Distributions of kernels: The kernels of the diﬀerent levels can run on dif-
ferent computers. Furthermore, the single levels may consist of several dis-
tributed kernels. Section 9.3.1 describes this principle at the example of a
multi-client and a multiple warehouse.
– Event-control: To achieve short response times, the event control is strin-
gently used according to the design pattern listener. Here, an object regis-
ters by callback with one or several other objects.
– Exception handling: Exceptions are unpredictable events during the run-
time like the accidental triggering of a sensor signal by the operating staﬀ.
Usually, the result of a radio request is returned to the requester in the form
of a feedback which describes the success or failure of the action. When
the implementation is correct this feedback is handled adequately. The
exception handling enforces a transparent further handling what directly
improves the quality of the software.
– Integrating active components: The plug-ins are called by the kernel via
their methods. They can concurrently carry out actions as independent
threads and thus increase the performance.
– Realization of associations: The business objects do not manage any asso-
ciations but are realized in the kernel. This is one of the prerequisites for
the distribution capability.
– Distribution of business objects: If a kernel temporarily distributes a busi-
ness process to a concurrent process this object is copied with the same
object number. Business objects are capable for serialization and are dis-
tributed via diﬀerent computers.
– Assurance of integrity: Although each business object makes elementary
integrity checks additional checks can be made with plug-ins. StockUnit,
for example, checks if the serial numbers are correctly completed with
allowed characters and blanks. With a plug-in it can be checked if these
serial numbers already exist.
– Persisting of data: The kernel requests persisting methods which have to
be provided by means of a plug-in interface. Some persisting plug-ins are
part of myWMS so that data can be secured via the database and the ﬁle
system can be used by means of serialization. For teaching and training
the data can be stored via the same interface without using a database.
According to the above-mentioned concepts the myWMS kernels and the
respective plug-ins should best be implemented in Java because it oﬀers:
12 This limitation does not imply that the kernels are trivial. The open source code
reveals the complexity and eﬃciency of this concept.

– Event and exception handling as well as multithread
– Interfaces to describe abstract classes
– Basic serialization concepts
– Remote Message Invocation (RMI),
– Extensive network capability
– Extensive class libraries for all kinds of problems
Furthermore, Java is the most commonly taught language used by most
programmers and software engineers and widely accepted.
9.3.4 Runtime environment
In addition to the kernel and the plug-in library myWMS has a runtime
environment, the “standard environment”, which oﬀers many useful functions
and can also be used for other projects. This environment is divided into the
following sections:
– Logging: The logging records diﬀerent messages which are transferred to
exactly one logserver according to their logLevel and category. myWMS
provides such a logserver as singleton. Thanks to a categorization into
– executing computer
– current user
– date and time
– object
– method
– thread
the messages can eﬃciently be analyzed oﬄine.
– Statistics: Rough statistical data are collected on a separate server, the
statistics server, analogous to the recording of log messages.
– Conﬁguration: In addition to the parametrization the conﬁguration de-
termines which plug-ins are used. When a user logs in at a conﬁguration
provider the registered objects are informed about changed conﬁgura-
tions. Thus, the conﬁguration can be changed also during the runtime.
– Clearing: Exceptions which cannot independently be handled by the sys-
tem are transferred to a clearing singleton13 with a given number of
responses or instructions. If a clearing receives such an exception the
correct response or acknowledgement of an instruction has to be chosen
from outside.
– Communication: Thanks to the channel concept of myWMS communi-
cation objects can be transmitted via diﬀerent physical and logical lines.
myWMS implements the transport via the layer of the ISO/OSI protocol
stack (cf. section 7.1.1) like the communication via RS232. The protocols
13 A class which corresponds to the design pattern of the singleton ensures that it
is initiated only once.

9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS
327
in the form of plug-ins allow for the serialization and deserialization of
the communication objects.
– Event multicasting: Diﬀerent listener objects can register at a panel ob-
ject which is a listener and thus build a listener group. Events which
arrive at the panel object are sent as a copy to all registered listeners.
The event multicasting implemented in myWMS can manage up to two
listener groups.
The included runtime environment does not necessarily have to be used;
only the interfaces have to be considered. Thus, the system can be integrated
into existing systems like an own logging.
9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS
This section describes a virtual warehouse with typical warehouse manage-
ment structures, its topology, operating means and logistic processes.
9.4.1 Description of the example
The functions are described at the example of a distribution system for small
household appliances. The system consists of a goods receipt and goods issue
and the warehouse with an order-picking zone. (cf. Fig. 9.9).
Arriving units are unloaded by stackers and buﬀered in reserved pick-up
zones. After they have been checked and entered into the system, they are
brought by stackers to the I-point of the warehouse system (input spur) or
into a separate blocking zone for an extensive quality check. On the one hand,
complete units are taken from the storage zone and brought with stackers
from the output spur to the buﬀer zones in the goods issue. On the other
hand, picking Us are built in front of the high-bay rack and transported
analogously to the goods output after completion.
Description of the warehouse system
The warehouse (cf. Fig. 9.10)
is a simple, automatic high-bay warehouse. On the one hand, it represents
typical components and warehouse processes to meet the requirements of the
reference system; on the other hand, it is simpliﬁed at many points to make
it less complex and to outline the most important aspects.
Topology
The presented warehouse has 4000 bins and uses Euro pallets
(800 mm×1200mm) as loading aids where the articles are transported and
stored homogeneously. It consists of the function areas high-bay rack, pre-
storage zone and order-picking terminals.
The high-bay warehouse consists of four aisles with two high-bay racks
each. Each aisle is served by a rack feeder. The pre-storage area connects
the diﬀerent function areas. Traversing cars are used for cross-transports.

Furthermore, the pre-storage area includes the input spur with an I-point,
the output spur and two transfer terminals per aisle where the units are
transferred between stacker and traversing car. Each of the four order-picking
stations consists of the “order-picking U”, the space for pickers and pallets
to be picked on collecting units. The order-picking U consists of the buﬀer to
be picked from as well as an upstream and downstream transfer terminal as
a connection to the traversing cars.
Warehouse technology This form of high-bay warehouse is widely used
in practice and represents a classical warehouse technology (cf. Chapter 4).
All racks have the same dimensions and are designed for the single-depth
lengthwise take-up of standard Euro-pallets. Each of the eight racks consists
of 50 sheds in horizontal and 10 sheds in vertical direction, i.e., 500 sheds per
rack and a total of 4000 racks. This warehouse does not consider specialities
like double-deep storage or racks of diﬀerent dimensions.
Conveyor technology
Each aisle is served by an automatic, rail-bound
overhead rack feeder (cf. section 4.2.2). The vehicle cannot change from one
aisle into another. All drives are electrical, the energy and control signals are
transmitted over contact lines. The load is taken up by a telescopic fork. The
most important parameters of the rack feeder are shown in Table 9.3.
The traversing car in the pre-storage area is also rail-bound. However,
the energy and control signals are transmitted over trailing cables and the
load take-up is a chain conveyor. Since it is a central and decisive element

Figure 9.10. The sample warehouse
the traversing car has a high acceleration and speed rate to meet the high
requirements.
Two chain conveyors set up in series act as transfer station between pre-
storage zone and high-bay rack and oﬀer a buﬀering capacity of two bins.
Each aisle is equipped with two such pairs of chain conveyors: One pair for
the input, one for the output. Together with two edge converters the chain
conveyor modules build the “order-picking Us”. The input and output belts
are two driven accumulating roller conveyors. A converter is integrated at the
end of the input line which transfers pallets (e.g., in case of a negative contour
check) directly to the output line or to the traversing car. Conventional front-
end fork lift trucks put pallets on the input line, retrieve pallets from the
output line or pick complete pallets. They receive their orders from a separate
stacker control system which is no ﬁxed part of this system.
Control technology First, the information for the control of an automatic
warehouse is given by the sensors and identiﬁcation devices. One of these
identiﬁcation media is a barcode label on the loading aid (cf. Chapter 6).
This label is applied during the goods receipt process, which takes place
outside the system boundary of the reference warehouse and, thus, is not
described here. Inside the warehouse each pallet can be identiﬁed by two
scanning stations. One of these is a stationary scanner at the beginning of

the input line and identiﬁes the pallets which enter the system. The second
station is a scanner at the traversing car. Furthermore, those pallets which
enter the system via the input line are submitted to a contour check.
Various light barriers (e.g., at the end of each accumulating roller conveyor
and each transfer station) allow for the tracking and tracing of goods within
the warehouse. The order-picking stations are equipped with switches where
the picker can acknowledge an order and with terminals which display the
article and quantity to be retrieved.
The sensors send all their information via a ﬁeld bus to superordinate
programmable logic controllers (PLC). These PLCs communicate with the
superordinate systems via Ethernet and TCP/IP. Depending on the control
philosophy this is the warehouse management system or a material ﬂow com-
puter and possible further sub-systems. Each PLC compacts the received
sensor information and sends a corresponding telegram to the superordinate
system. Each PLC receives control telegrams from the superordinate sys-
tem which it converts into control commands for subordinate activators. The
control architecture is hierarchical and designed as a client/server structure.
Figures 9.11 and 9.12 give an overview over the logical and physical archi-
tecture of the system.
The conveyor system is controlled by a total of six PLCs: one for each
rack feeder, one for the traversing car and one for the remaining pre-storage

9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS

zone including the order-picking stations. The PLC layer is the joint interface
between subordinate control and superordinate systems.
Material ﬂow The possible routes of a pallet through the reference ware-
house are determined by the described topology and the used conveyors. The
traversing car plays a central role because it is the sole connection between
the function areas and a node14. Because of the unidirectional transport at
the single transfer stations, the traversing car can either take up a pallet
at a station (transfer onto the traversing car) or hand over a pallet at this
station (transfer from the traversing car). No transfer station can transfer
and receive pallets from the traversing car. Typical routes of a pallet through
the warehouse are determined by the logistic functions. Basically these are
storage, retrieval and order-picking. Typical routes using a traversing car are:
– Storage in aisle 4: identiﬁcation point →TC →U1r →RF4 →Storage
bin
– Retrieval from aisle 1: Storage bin →RF1 →U1l →TC →Output line
– Order-picking: Storage bin →RF2 →U2l →TC →Order −pickingU2
→TC U2r →RF →Storage bin
Typical routes without a traversing car are:
– Restorage in aisle 1: Storage bin →RF1 →Storage bin
– Negative contour check: Input line →Output line
14 Although transports are bundled on a central device and despite of possible bot-
tlenecks well-dimensioned distribution vehicles are an inexpensive, space-saving
and eﬃcient solution.

332
9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
Logistic processes Conveyors, warehouse technology and controls together
with the articles to be managed build the basis for the warehouse management
system. The tasks of a WMS are described in Chapter 2. Basic processes
closely related to the material ﬂow are:
A) Storage
B) Retrieval
C) Order-picking
The speciﬁc characteristics of these processes are roughly described below
and determine the requirements on the WMS to be implemented.
Storage When a pallet is transferred at the identiﬁcation point the unit
load is identiﬁed by the stationary scanner. The corresponding PLC then
sends a telegram with the pallet ID to the WMS where the message triggers
the process. First, it is checked if the pallet ID is known. If not, this is an
error since the pallet ID should have been sent to the WMS during the goods
receipt process together with the article ID. In this case, an order is generated
to transport the pallet onto the output line so that it can be discharged and
brought to the clearing station. The same happens when the scanner can
identify no pallet ID (NO READ).
When the WMS knows the pallet ID, the pallet is moved to the accumu-
lating roller conveyor and to the contour check. If the scanned proﬁle does
not correspond to the speciﬁcations the pallet is directly discharged from the
system via the output line. Otherwise, the goods are booked into the inven-
tory, a storage order is generated and a corresponding storage bin is blocked.
This bin should be chosen so that the articles are
A) distributed evenly over all aisles
B) arranged within the aisles according to an ABC zoning.
The even distribution of articles over all aisles improves the accessability,
while the ABC zoning grants a quick access on fast-selling articles. If no
suitable bins are available an article can principally be stored in each empty
bin. The storage process is terminated when the respective load carrier could
be booked on the correct storage bin.
Retrieval and order-picking Customer orders are entered into the WMS
via an ERP system and stored in a queue. A customer order generally consists
of several items. If a position cannot be fulﬁlled because there are not enough
units of the desired articles in store the complete order is rejected and a
message is sent to the ERP. Otherwise, the WMS includes the order into
the queue which is handled according to the FIFO principle. Based on the
customer orders, the WMS generates retrieval orders and selects the unit
loads to be retrieved. It has to make sure that the unit loads are chosen
according to the following – possibly conﬂicting – goals:

9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS
333
A) The number of pallets to be picked should be as small as possible, i.e., unit
loads should be retrieved directly. Broken pallets should be considered as
well.
B) The unit load with the oldest storage date should be retrieved at ﬁrst.
C) The rack feeders should be loaded as evenly as possible.
Pallets which cannot be picked are removed from the warehouse by traversing
cars and output lines. When the traversing car picks up the pallet at the
transfer station it makes a scan to ensure that the pallet is the right one. If this
is not the case the pallet is brought to the clearing station. Otherwise, when
the pallet arrives at the output line the stacker control system is requested
to bring this pallet to the buﬀer in the goods issue determined in the order.
If a position cannot be completed with complete pallets articles have to be
picked. In this case, the pallet identiﬁed as suitable by the WMS is brought
by the traversing car from the high-bay warehouse to the speciﬁed picking
station. There, the picker is informed on his terminal how many units he has
to retrieve and to place onto the provided pallet. By pressing a switch he
informs the WMS that the picking order is complete. The WMS then deﬁnes
a new storage bin for the pallet. It furthermore checks if all positions of the
current order have been completed. If this is the case the WMS instructs the
stacker control system to remove the order pallet to the respective buﬀer in
the goods issue where picked and directly retrieved unit loads are consolidated
and packed for shipment.
9.4.2 Topology structure
The topology of a warehouse which consists of storage bins, machines and
their connections is set up in Java using the kernel methods. The storage bins
are represented by objects of the class StorageLocation where diﬀerent access
methods can be chosen (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, RandomAccess) depending on the
requirements. The location of the bins is of no importance for the WMS and
thus not shown.
Objects of the class HandlingScope represent a working area for the ma-
chines which connect the objects of the class StorageLocation. Each Load-
Handler which represents a machine operates at a time on exactly one Han-
dlingScope. The following code shows the principle topology structure:
// Structure of an aisle side
EquipmentKernelInterface ek = ... // Connection to kernel
int x=50;
// Aisle depth : 50 bins
int y=10;
// Aisle height : 10 bins
int i,j;
// Run variables
long tid;
// Transaction handle
StorageLocation sl;
// temporary SL for ALL bins

334
9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
HandlingScope hs;
// temporary HS for total aisles
String HandlingScopeName =...// Name of the aisle
...
tid = ek.beginTransaction(); // Start of a transaction
hs = ek.getHandlingScope(HandlingScopeName, tid);
// existing handlingScope
// incl. requesting Loadhandler
for ( i = 0 ; i < x ; i++ ) {
for ( j = 0 ; j < y ; j++ ) {
try{
sl = ek.createStorageLocation(tid);
sl.setName(getBinName(i,j));
// getBinName provides
// individual name
sl.setStorageType(StorageLocation.LIFO);
sl.setDepth(1);
// one UnitLoad per bin
ek.setStorageLocation(sl,tid); // sl to kernel
hs.addStorageLocation(sl);
// Connection hs with sl
}
catch (...) {
...
}
}
}
try {
ek.setHandlingScope(hs,tid);
// hs return to kernel
}
catch (IntegrityException iex){
...
}
try {
ek.commit(tid);
// Carry out transaction
}
catch (TransactionException tex){
...
}
...
This code fragment requires a HandlingScope as well as a LoadHandler
including its load take-up consisting of a StorageLocation. In this example the
business objects are instantiated by the 500 StorageLocations according to
the create methods of the kernel, here ek.createStorageLocation(tid).
Each business object can be addressed by its name which is assigned by the
method sl.setName(name) of the StorageLocation.
Then the type “LIFO” is assigned to the storage bin with the method
sl.setStorageType(StorageLocation.LIFO) as well as the capacity with
the method sl.setDepth(1). The type LIFO was chosen for racks consider-
ing a future extension for a multiple-depth storage. With such an extension
it would be suitable to set the shelf depth with the method sl.setDepth(n).

9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS
335
Furthermore, the access strategy would have to be adjusted to the racks
since it cannot be guaranteed that the desired loading aid can directly be
accessed. The kernel is informed about this adjusted access strategy by the
plug-in method.
For further management, the method ek.setStorageLocation(sl,tid)
is used to transmit the newly generated and conﬁgured StorageLocation
to the kernel. Finally, the rack is connected to the HandlingScope by
hs.addStorageLocation(sl). The method hs.addStorageLocation(sl)
ensures a bi-directional material ﬂow (stacker ⇔bin).
With this method all other bins, in addition to the 3500 sheds, are cre-
ated and allocated to at least one HandlingScope. The transfer stations be-
tween rack feeder and traversing car, for example, are connected to two Han-
dlingScopes. Since the material ﬂow at the transfer stations is bi-directional
the methods hs.addPutAway(sl) or hs.addRetrieval(sl) have to be used
for the HandlingScopes.
The line ek.beginTransaction() starts a transaction which is then man-
aged by its transaction handle tid. This transaction is stopped only when
ek.commit(tid) is called. Thus, the generated objects are persisted and be-
come available for other kernel methods.
9.4.3 Plug-In – Routing
The route from a source, e.g., a shelf, to a sink, e.g., an order-picking sta-
tion, is calculated by a plug-in which fulﬁlls the RouteStrategyInterface.
With the class RouteStrategyFirstMatch, myWMS provides a simple rout-
ing plug-in which always ﬁnds a route by means of excursion.
In practice it will do to adjust this class to the requirements accord-
ing to the inheritance principle. Often, it is suﬃcient to overwrite the
method findWay() of the class RouteStrategyFirstMatch with an algo-
rithm which meets the warehouse requirements. findWay() is called by the
method route() of the plug-in interface.
Alternatively, it is possible to fulﬁll the interface directly with an own
class without deduction. In addition to the inherited interfaces15 just the
method route() has to be implemented.
public interface RouteStrategyInterface
extends PluginInterface
{
OrderChain[] route(final OrderChain[] orders, long tid)
throws TransactionException;
}
Pairs of sources and sinks are transferred to the method route() and
route() computes a route for each of these pairs. Source and sink are a
15 PluginInterface and its predecessor ConﬁgurationClientInterface.

336
9. Structure of a WMS from the Example of myWMS
StorageLocation and are transmitted to an otherwise empty OrderChain.
The route is also returned to the caller as OrderChain, but with exact details
consisting of the single StorageLocations connected by HandlingScopes.
route() is the multiple application of the mathematical function r which
operates on the transport network with the node l and the edges in the
HandlingScope h:
r(l1, l2) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
null
l1 = l2
null
there is no route
l1, (h, l)∗, h, l2
otherwise
The function reveals that there is not always a route between two Stor-
ageLocations.
The represented plug-in has to be registered at the kernel. For this pur-
pose, a corresponding entry is made into the conﬁguration ﬁle. The conﬁgu-
ration manager instantiates the plug-ins and integrates them into the kernel.
Figure 9.13 shows the interrelation of the diﬀerent components:
– The kernel provides a plug-in interface with pre-deﬁned method names,
their arguments and feedback parameters.
– A plug-in has to fulﬁll this interface.
– The plug-in can be extended by inheritance.
– The conﬁguration determines which plug-in is used by the kernel.
This method has to be observed by all plug-in interfaces. myWMS oﬀers
an extensive library of predeﬁned plug-ins by which a simple WMS can be
set up.
9.4.4 Communication
The communication between myWMS and the subordinate actuators and
sensors, respectively their combination into sub-systems, is a basic part of
the equipment kernel which controls the material ﬂow. During this commu-
nication the kernel sends and receives objects while the connected devices
receive and send byte streams of diﬀerent formats.
The basic class of all communication objects is the class ComObject which
provides basic methods such as the property management. The design pat-
tern “property” with the two methods setProperty()and getProperty()
facilitates the implementation of diﬀerent classes derived from ComObjects.
The class DirectedMessage is directly derived from ComObject and with
the protected methods setProperty() and getProperty()provides public
functions to set and get the following attributes:
– sender generates the instance.
– receiver receives the message.
– functionCode describes the type of message.

If a functionCode is given which is known to myWMS a special object
is generated. Figure Fig. 9.14 shows possible structures in a class diagram. It
is clearly deﬁned how specialized communication objects have to be handled
in myWMS. Communication objects with a known functionCode cannot be
evaluated by myWMS but are designed for application-speciﬁc extensions.

elements of this derivation level but stored in the property structure of the
root class. These new attributes are:
– transportSource the starting point of the transport.
– transportDestination the ﬁnal point of the transport.
– orderNumber a consecutive number for the transport.
– unitLoads the number of transport units.
The single steps of a transport order are represented in MfcTrans-
portOrder in the form of a routing strategy and communicated to the ex-
ecuting machine by the protocol channel method.
The communication objects are exchanged with the environment via the
channel (cf. section 9.3.4). The channel is responsible for the data transport
and uses the protocol object to serialize the communication objects or to
construct them from the byte streams.
public interface Protocol {

9.4 Example of a distribution system using myWMS
339
...
public byte[] eval(ComObject comObject, ...)
throws ComException;
public ComObject[] eval(byte[] bytes, ...);
}
Each protocol has to comply with the above mentioned protocol interface.
The most important method is eval which has to be implemented twice by
overloading.
– During a serialization the ﬁrst parameter transferred to eval is a ComObject.
According to the protocol to be implemented the ComObject is converted
into an array of bytes (byte[]) and returned to the caller.
– During the deserialization the ﬁrst parameter transferred to eval is a byte
array. The byte array is the section of a received stream. For the construc-
tion of a ComObject it does not matter whether it is incomplete, contains
data for one or several ComObjects, incomplete parts of the next or is
faulty. Complete byte sequences are converted into ComObjects and re-
turned in an array. Incomplete byte sequences have to be buﬀered until
the next eval request.
myWMS includes several protocols with diﬀerent targets. There are
classes for the communication with a choice of AutoID devices while other
classes represent protocols for the data exchange with material ﬂow comput-
ers. The class XMLProtocol is a universally suitable protocol which uses the
ﬂexibility of the XML meta language and all XML tools.
<message type="WMSmessage">
<header sequence="0005" receiver="PLC3"
sender="WMS7" />
<MfcTransportOrder unitLoads="0001"
orderNumber="3"
transportSource="1.2"
transportDestination="1.7" />
</message>
This example shows a serialized MfcTransportOrder object which was
serialized by an instance of the XMLprotocol and sent in this form to a
transport facility (LoadHandler). The identiﬁers for the transport source and
sink correspond to the “point of view” of the transport device.
This section describes basic techniques at the example of simple distribu-
tion systems. It was pointed out that a WMS includes more than just one data
model. Warehouse management systems are complex systems which have to
meet diﬀerent requirements and thus are a challenge for software engineers.
In recent years this science has developed into a valuable engineering disci-
pline - especially thanks to the use of object-oriented techniques and suitable
usable methods and tools.

The future goal is to fulﬁll diﬀerent requirements in a high quality and
without individual reprogramming by means of suitable methods and stan-
dards. In addition to WMS which are based on relational databases the pre-
sented concept is one possibility to reach this goal.

System requirements  
THE MYWMS DEMO CD IS A BOOT CD! 
When the CD is inserted and the computer is switched on, a Linux 
operating system on the CD is booted.  
hardware: System requirements for the myWMS demo systems are a 
x86 PC, min. 512 MB memory and 1 GHz CPU. A higher memory and 
computing capacity of the CPU will increase the system performance 
considerably.  
Boot version: This CD is bootable. After the CD drive has been activated 
as boot device (to be set in the BIOS) the system is booted directly from 
the CD without access to the hard disk. When the CD is removed the PC 
runs as usual.  
Linux: The CD holds a JRE (Jave Runtime Environment), version 1.4.1, 
which don’t need to be installed. 
Windows: Under Windows a JRE (Jave Runtime Environment) version 
1.4.n has to be installed on the PC. It can be obtained at java.sun.com as 
packed or executable file.
