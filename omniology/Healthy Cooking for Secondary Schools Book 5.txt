Healthy Cooking for Secondary Schools (Book 5)
www.brilliantpublications.co.uk
Simple practical cooking is a fundamental life skill that all young people should be 
able to master by the time they leave secondary school. 
Through practical cooking, young people are empowered to make healthy choices 
themselves. These choices take place all the time: when we plan our meals, when 
we shop, when we store our food and when we cook it. At every stage of the 
cooking process, young people need to have the knowledge to turn these choices 
into informed choices.
The understanding of food, nutrition and balanced diets, safety and hygiene is most 
successfully acquired through practical experiences. Through cooking and using a 
wide range of skills, ingredients and recipes, young people are given the chance to 
appreciate that cooking is for everyone.
Healthy Cooking for Secondary Schools (Book 5) is part of a series of ﬁ ve books, 
providing a practical cooking programme for schools, designed to foster enthusiasm 
for cooking and give young people the tools to choose a healthy life. Each book 
contains 12 easy-to-follow recipes.
For each recipe you will ﬁ nd:
 
Skill focus for lesson –These become progressively more advanced as   
 
you progress through the series
 
Theory – Providing information on where food comes from, nutrition,   
 
balanced diet and healthy eating
 
Health and safety points.
Each recipe appears in two formats, so that you can choose the format best suited to 
your students:
 
Illustrated step-by-step format
 
Traditional format
The step-by-step format is particularly suited to lower ability groups. The instructions 
are the same in both versions, so you may use both in mixed ability classes.

How to use the Resources
All ingredients are based on two pupils sharing, and the timings will all ﬁ t into a 
double lesson of approximately 80 minutes. We recommend you use low-fat options 
where possible.
Make a display using the Visual Lesson Structure Cards (pages 7–10) and pictures of 
the recipe and skill to be focussed on in the lesson (to download colour photos of 
the recipes, log on to www.brilliantpublications.co.uk/PAGE1028 and click on the 
recipe you want). 
Keep the skill, theory and health and safety point sheets to hand so that you can refer 
to them when demonstrating to pupils. (The language has been kept as simple as 
possible on these sheets, so you may wish to give copies to your pupils as well.)
Choose the best format of the recipe to use for each pair of children and photocopy 
sufﬁ cient copies. The illustrated versions of the recipes can be photocopied onto 
either an A3 sheet (if space is an issue, fold it in half so that you view six steps at a 
time), or reduced to A4 size. 
If you place the recipes and other sheets in clear plastic wallets (or laminate them), 
they can be used again and again.
Encourage children to gather together all the ingredients and equipment they need 
before starting. They could tick things off on their copy of the recipe.
Demonstrate the recipe 2–3 steps at a time, introducing the skill, theory and health 
and safety points as you progress through the recipe.
An important aspect of learning to cook is learning to work together. You may wish 
to display the Discussion cards on pages 11–12 (Communicate, Share, Help, Be 
pleasant) so that you can refer to these throughout the lesson.
There are assessment sheets on pages 85 and 86 that provide a fun way of testing the 
practical and theoretical knowledge gained.  The Certiﬁ cate of Achievement on page 
87 can either be used as an ongoing record or be given out when all the recipes in 
the book have been completed.
Above all, have fun and enjoy cooking!

Good sharing follows on from good communicating. If you have 
communicated well, you will have reached a fair decision about sharing. 
Sharing works best when it has been done fairly and everyone is happy. 
Sharing is particularly difﬁ cult if it involves doing something really exciting or 
really boring. You have to imagine that the other person feels very much like 
yourself. This can be hard to imagine, but it is an important lesson to learn. 
Sharing is a lot easier when you talk together about things.
Communicate
It is vital to have good communication in the kitchen. If you are working with 
a partner, it is important to say what you are doing and to agree on who does 
what. You have to talk about what you would like to do and listen to what your 
partner wants to do. Then you have to work out a way to make it fair for both 
of you. You can only come to an agreement if you talk together! 
You should also let others know if there are any dangers, such as you opening 
the oven or if water has been spilt on the ﬂ oor. Talking is absolutely key to 
good cooking habits. The better you are at communicating, the better you are 
at cooking in a school kitchen.

Help
 Be pleasant
It is important to be able to help others, but it is also important to accept help 
from others. Help is a two-way thing. If you are offering your help to someone 
else, it is important that you choose your words carefully. Be kind in giving 
your help, as it can be hard to accept help given with harsh words. If you have 
communicated well, you will be able to help each other well. If you are very 
capable, offer your help kindly, but also let others help you in return, even if it is 
to do with something you feel you might already know about.
It is, in fact, very simple to be pleasant. Look at and listen to the person you are 
working with and notice something he or she does well. Then say something 
pleasant about that. You will soon discover that the more pleasant you are to 
people, the more pleasant they are back to you. You can also do something 
pleasant, like smile at a person or pat someone kindly on the back. Don’t just 
wait for someone to be pleasant to you; try to be the ﬁ rst one to say or do 
something pleasant.

It is best to watch a demonstration of someone rolling a croissant. You will see that 
the dough is ﬁ rst rolled out into a circle and cut in quarters. Next, each quarter 
is rolled up, starting at the wide end and rolling into a point. Then the rolled-
up dough is shaped into a crescent shape and the end or tip is tucked under the 
dough, so that it doesn’t come undone during baking.

Foods Contain More Than 
One Type of Nutrient
Always be aware of the smells in a kitchen, particularly when you have something 
in the oven. You can generally smell when the food in the oven is ready. You can 
also smell when it is burning. The more you bake, the more you will be able to 
understand the smells you smell. 
When we begin to learn about nutrients, we tend to generalize to make it simple. 
We might say that protein is found in meat and eggs, carbohydrates are found in 
bread and pasta and vitamins are found in vegetables. This is all true. However, 
most foods contain more than just one type of nutrient. When we say that eggs 
have protein in them, this is true, but they also have other nutrients in them, 
including vitamins A, D and E, B vitamins, iron and calcium. When we talk 
about nutrients in bread, don’t forget that bread ﬂ our contains protein in addition 
to carbohydrates. On top of that, bread also contains yeast, margarine and 
sometimes milk, all of which have their own nutrients in them.

How to Coat Fish in Flour
Many ﬁ sh recipes use breadcrumbs as a coating. Often you will be asked to coat 
the ﬁ sh in egg ﬁ rst and then in breadcrumbs. Salmon patties are very moist from 
the outset, so we do not need to coat them in egg ﬁ rst. You can choose whether 
to coat the patties in breadcrumbs or just in plain ﬂ our. In either case, you put a 
little ﬂ our or breadcrumbs on a plate and then you simply turn the patty over in it 
several times to coat it. The ﬂ our will help to make the patty more solid and stick 
together better.

What is Omega 3 Good for?
Keep cooked food and raw meat separate.
Omega 3 is found in all ﬁ sh. The main source for omega 3 is found in oily 
ﬁ sh such as tuna, sardines, salmon and mackerel, but is also present in soya, 
pumpkin seeds, walnuts and leafy-green vegetables in small quantities. Omega 3 
is a type of fat, but it is a good fat which has many health beneﬁ ts and therefore 
it is a fat we need a lot of. One major beneﬁ t is that it is very good for the heart. 
Scientiﬁ c studies also point to the fact that Omega 3 is very good for the brain 
and helps to relieve anxiety, depression and ADHD. It is also a natural anti-
inﬂ ammatory.
This recipe calls for tinned salmon. However, you can also use fresh salmon, 
bought in most supermarkets. If you bought fresh salmon you would need to 
keep it separate from the cooked foods. We need to keep cooked food and raw 
meat separate. This is because the raw meat, and its juices can contaminate any 
cooked food. Always use separate equipment for raw meat and always keep raw 
meat separate from other food in the fridge, in your shopping trolley and in your 
shopping bags.

How to Check Chicken is 
Cooked
To check whether your chicken pieces are done, you simply take a chicken piece 
out of the saucepan and cut it. The chicken is done if the centre is no longer pink. 
For chicken with bones in, you stick a fork or a knife into the meat; if the juices 
run clear, it is done.

What is Salmonella?
Salmonella is a type of bacteria found particularly in chicken and eggs. The 
salmonella bacteria attack the stomach and intestines. If you get salmonella 
poisoning, you could suffer from diarrhoea, vomiting and fever. You can avoid 
salmonella infections by always washing your hands before preparing food and 
after touching meat, by observing good kitchen hygiene, by proper storage of food 
and by cooking food (particularly eggs and chicken) thoroughly. 
If you have a lid on your saucepan, you must be careful when you lift it off. This 
is because the steam inside the saucepan will escape rapidly and can burn you. 
Therefore, when you take off the lid, stand well clear and turn the lid slightly to 
allow the steam to be released without any obstructions. This will also allow any 
water to drain off.

How to Use Filo Pastry
Filo pastry consists of paper-thin dough. When you use it, you have to be both 
careful and quick. Filo pastry tears easily and it dries out very quickly as well, 
especially in a hot kitchen. As soon as you have taken the ﬁ lo pastry you need, 
cover the rest up in cling ﬁ lm again.

Onions come in a wide range of sizes, shapes and colours, as well as speciﬁ c 
varieties. There are fresh onions and onions for storage. There are onions for eating 
raw and onions for cooking. Basically there are three kinds of onions: bunching 
onions which include spring onions and green onions; bulb or common onions 
including dry onions for storing or for cooking; and pickling onions. 
Onions were important in the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. This was 
because they thought the onion’s round shape and concentric rings symbolized 
eternal life. As with any other circle or ring, there is no beginning and no end; 
it simply goes round endlessly. The ancient Egyptians even buried their dead 
with onions. Ramesses IV was buried with onion rings placed on his eyes. It was 
believed that the strong smell of the onions would bring back breath to the dead.
You should always keep your kitchen bin clean. This is because it is an 
environment where micro-organisms will thrive. Always have a lid on the bin and 
keep it closed. When you remove the bin bag, tie a knot in it and put it straight 
in your outdoor bin. Your outdoor bin should be well away from the kitchen and 
should always have the lid closed. Some people recycle their organic waste for 
compost. This must also be done in a hygienic way, using a bin with a lid and 
regularly emptying and cleaning the bin.

Börek is a pastry dish originating from Turkey and the Middle East. They are 
usually ﬁ lled with cheese, potato, spinach or ground lamb and are often folded in 
the same way as a samosa. You take the ﬁ lo pastry and cut it in half lengthwise. 
When you have brushed the strips with oil, you put a teaspoon of the mixture in 
the corner. Then you start folding the pastry into triangles. Watch a demonstration 
of it and then try to do it yourself.

Feta cheese comes from Greek cuisine. It is a cheese that is salted and cured in 
brine for several months. Brine is salty water. Traditionally, feta cheese is made 
from goat’s milk or sheep’s milk. It is mainly produced in blocks and has a grainy 
texture. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese which has a rich tangy salty ﬂ avour.
Feta can be crumbled over salads (the Classic Greek Salad), or mixed together 
with sliced tomatoes, sprinkled with olive oil and fresh herbs. It is also used as a 
ﬁ lling for puff pastry.
What is Feta Cheese?
Make sure you have a general feeling/awareness of what is going on around you 
in the kitchen. Don’t just concente on one detail of the recipe at a time, know 
what the next step is going to be and be aware of the other people around you and 
what stages they have reached. Make sure you keep the kitchen clean and tidy as 
you go, as this minimises the risks of accidents. The more time you spend working 
in the kitchen, the more aware you will become of the complete process and the 
easier it will get.
Be Aware of Your 
Surroundings

How to Cut a Pepper
The safest way to cut a pepper is to cut off all the sides. There are other ways 
of doing it, but this method is the safest. Hold the stalk of the pepper and use a 
sharp knife to cut down one side. Then put the cut side down on the chopping 
board and cut off the next side. Continue until you have cut off all four sides. 
You will be left with the core with all the seeds on.

Correct Food Storage is 
Important
When you are cooking foods in a frying pan or saucepan that has a handle, 
make sure that the handle never sticks out over the edge of the cooker. If the 
handle were to stick out, someone could easily walk into it by accident. This 
would probably knock the frying pan off the hob and onto the ﬂ oor or even over 
somebody. Therefore, always make sure that the handle is turned in over the 
working area.
Always turn pan handles inwards over the cooker 
or work surface when using them.
Correct food storage plays an important role in maintaining good food hygiene. 
Some foods need to be stored in a cool and dark place, like a pantry. Other 
foods need to be frozen. Yet other foods need to be chilled in a fridge. Always 
make sure that you store food in the right place, at the right temperature and for 
the right amount of time. Remember that no food lasts for ever, however well it 
is stored. Check labels for storage instructions and learn where food should be 
stored.
Turn Handles Inwards Over

How to Grill Bacon
There are many ways of cooking bacon: frying, microwaving, baking or grilling. To 
grill bacon, you simply cover the grill tray with tin foil and then place the bacon 
on (using of tin foil will make the tray easier to clean). After this, put the grill on 
medium heat, and when it is up to temperature, slide the bacon under. Always 
keep an eye on it and turn it occasionally until it is ready. Be aware that hot fats 
can easily burn you and can catch ﬁ re quickly too.

Where Does Bacon Come 
From?
Always check the sell-by-date and the use-by-
date.
Always make sure that the food you are using has not exceeded its use-by date. 
This is easy on packaged products, as the sell-by date and/or use-by dates are 
displayed on the packaging itself. You should plan your shopping and cooking so 
that you can use the food well before its sell-by date. Also, check sell-by dates on 
the products when you buy them, and pick the freshest one. 
Bacon comes from pigs. More accurately, it comes from the side, back or belly of 
the pig. Bacon can be cured or smoked, which means that the bacon is salted and 
dried or smoked. It is usually cut thinly into “rashers”. Bacon is basically meat and 
fat; some bacon rashers have more fat on than others. You can see the fat, because 
it is white, so try to get the bacon with the least fat on it as it is healthier for you.

To turn a drop scone, you need to use a turner. Check that the scone is ﬁ rm 
enough to ﬂ ip over by peeping under it when lifting it slightly with the turner. 
When it is light brown, you push the turner under the entire drop scone and ﬂ ip 
it over quickly, though not too quickly as you can splash yourself with hot oil.

You can check the freshness of an egg by putting it in a bowl of cold water. If 
it ﬂ oats, it has gone off; if it sits ﬁ rmly on the bottom, it is fresh. If the egg is 
beginning to ﬂ oat, the freshness is somewhere in between. The ﬂ oating happens 
because of the air pocket that is inside all eggs at the blunt end. As the egg gets 
older, the air pocket gets bigger, and this is what eventually makes the egg ﬂ oat. 
The air actually gets in gradually through the eggshell that is, in fact, slightly 
porous.
Pay attention when you are using the hob.
Testing the Freshness of an 
Egg
Hobs Remain Hot After Use
Always maintain a high level of awareness whilst in the kitchen. You should 
always remember to turn off the hob after use and remember that the hob 
whether it’s gas or electric will remain very hot for a time while it goes through 
the cooling process. A great number of house ﬁ res are caused by carelessness 
in the kitchen; a deep-fat-fryer not being turned off after use will catch ﬁ re very 
quickly.

It is a useful skill to be able to cook on a low heat. This means that you will have 
to watch the saucepan or frying pan closely and adjust the controls if needed. 
You also need to know what it looks, sounds and smells like when the food 
is getting too hot or even too cool. It takes practice to learn this properly. The 
reason for cooking food on a low heat is to cook it through thoroughly without 
burning it.

Tortilla is a Spanish omelette – very different from the thin, ﬂ at bread also called 
tortilla in Mexico. The Spanish tortilla is made with thin slices of potato and eggs. 
Other vegetables are often added as well.
Most pathogens (harmful bacteria) grow best in temperatures between 5˚C and 
63˚C, with optimum growth around 37˚C (the temperature of the human body). 
Pathogens are dormant at temperatures below 5˚C. At temperatures above 63˚C, 
their growth stops. However, pathogens are killed only at temperatures above 
70˚C. It is therefore recommended that to kill pathogens during the cooking 
process, food must reach a temperature of 70˚C for 2 minutes. Therefore, make 
sure that your heat is not so low during the whole tortilla cooking process that it 
does not kill potential pathogens.

To chop parsley, you have to gather all the washed parsley leaves into a tight 
heap. Whilst you hold onto the heap with one hand, you chop it from one 
end. When it has been chopped roughly, you start cutting the heap of parsley 
again from one end to the other. If you are capable with a knife, you can guide 
the knife gently by putting your hand on top of the knife as you are cutting 
the parsley. Remember to gather the loose parsley every now and again and 
continue until all the parsley is ﬁ nely chopped.

When you plan your meals, you have to look at the bigger picture. The idea 
is that you get all the nutrients you need as often as you need. It is therefore 
sensible to plan a whole week’s meals in one go, making sure that each meal 
covers all the basic nutrients. You do not need all nutrients every day, because 
the body can store certain nutrients, but make sure that these are covered some 
time in the week.
Always store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge. This is to avoid cross-
contamination, as raw meat may drip juices onto other food. Keep cooked and 
uncooked foods apart so that the uncooked foods do not pass on any bacteria to 
the cooked foods.

When you make macaroni cheese, you have to add the milk gradually to make 
the sauce. This enables you to mix a smooth sauce, and it allows the mixture 
to thicken slowly. You have to know how much milk to add, and you have to 
remember that it thickens gradually over heat and not straight away.

You store milk in the fridge. Keep the milk container closed in order to avoid the 
absorption of other food ﬂ avours. Always return the milk to the fridge as soon 
as you have used it; don’t just leave it on the kitchen table. Always use the milk 
before the best-before date.
Obesity is the terminology used to describe the condition of people who are 
very, very fat – more than just a few pounds overweight. It is, in fact, a medical 
term used for very overweight people (people who carry more than 20% extra 
body weight). These people are at an increased risk of a lot of diseases, such as 
diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. 
To avoid obesity, you have to eat a healthy and balanced diet. You can eat as 
much fresh fruit and vegetables as you like, but remember to avoid eating junk 
food and sweets more than once-a-week as these foods are full of fats, salts and 
sugars. Exercise plays a key role to keeping your weight down, although some 
overweight people have medical conditions that prevent them from losing weight.
Eat sensibly, exercise more.

How to Add Food Gradually 
When you have a number of foods to fry in the same frying pan, chances are that 
you will not add them all at the same time. This is because different foods need 
different amounts of frying time. Some need more and some need less, and you 
add them gradually so that it will all be ﬁ nished and ready at the same time. It 
takes a lot of food knowledge to be able to do this well.

Where Do Samosas Come 
From?
Samosas are very common in South Asian countries, such as Pakistan, India and 
Nepal. It is believed that samosas originally came from Central Asia as far back as 
before the 10th century. Traditionally, samosas are fried, but many people prefer to 
bake them nowadays.
“A healthy mind in a healthy body” is in fact a quote from the Roman poet Juvenal 
(55AD to 127AD). It is a quote that has been much used ever since. Basically, it 
means that if you feel well physically, you will feel well mentally. Your mental and 
physical well-being are linked. We still very much believe this today when we talk 
about Healthy Living. In other words: exercise, healthy eating and happiness in 
general are all linked. Think about it!
