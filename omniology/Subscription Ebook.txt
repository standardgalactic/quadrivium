I will be showing you how to get any two (2) subscription cards for the price of 
one! (Xbox,iTunes,PS3, ECT) 
 
Things Needed: 
- Money to buy what subscription card you want. 
- Knowledge  
 
Step 1: 
Go to your local Best Buy, Target, Wall Mart, Fredmeyers, or anywhere that sells 
the subscription card you want to buy. 
 
Step 2: 
Buy your subscription card you want, KEEP THE RECEIPT. 
 
Step 3: 
Scratch the gray bar thing, and right down the REDEEM CODE, make sure you 
written it CORRECTLY! Also DON'T NOT REDEEM IT! Repeat! DO NOT REDEEM IT! 
 
Step 4: 
Go back to where you bought your card and tell them that you tried to redeem it 
and it wouldn't work, you tried multiple times and it gave some message that it 
can't redeem or something. They will call Microsoft, Sony, whatever card you 
got. 
and ask them if you redeemed it [Note: Might take a few minutes] They'll check 
if you redeemed it or not, if haven't WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE, then they'll 
give you a new one! 
 
Step 5: 
Go home then redeem the code you wrote down first, in case they find out you 
just ripped them off. Then you got the new one they gave you! :) and there you 
go! You got 2 subscription cards for the price of one! 
 
Step 6: 
Do not go back to the same store and keep on doing it unless your retarded. If 
your going to continue to do this then go to different stores. 
 
I have tired this, it worked perfectly, so it should work for you unless the 
store is a pain in the ass. I hope I helped you, and find something new out. 
Good luck everyone!
