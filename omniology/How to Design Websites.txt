Coding, and conforming to standards, could be seen by 
some as constraining, but there are plenty of examples on the 
web of beautiful functional design achieved without resorting 	
to Flash or type-as-image methods that play fast and loose with 
accessibility. Conversely there are sites on the web that may 
have impeccable coding but lack imagination, don’t tell a story 
and are downright boring.
This book aims to be a hands-on guide to designing 
websites for anyone who needs a web presence – be they 
designers, makers, illustrators, artists or photographers – with 
the curiosity to want to take charge of the process. Above 	
all, it is a practical and pragmatic handbook. Why reinvent the 
wheel? There are many generous and talented pathfinder 
people on the web who have already been along the learning 
curve and are waiting to help, with public-domain templates, 
plug-ins and helper programs, that will make ‘coding’ as painless 
as it can be – mostly just a matter of copying and pasting. This 
book aims to provide you with the framework and knowledge 
to design websites. You just need to add the all-important 
sparkling content – so go and create!
I would like to thank Jo Lightfoot at Laurence King 
Publishing for commissioning this book, editor John Jervis for 
his patience, support and sensible suggestions to improve 	
the text, copy editor Kirsty Seymour-Ure for asking the sort of 
questions that require clear and concise answers that ultimately 
make the text easier to understand, Emily Asquith for a final 
look through the content to make sure all was ready for print, 
and designer Jessie Earle for adding lots of visual interest to 
my words and code – creating a book that is a joy to read.
Alan Pipes
Do designers need to learn code? Should they code their 	
own designs? After all, architects don’t build the houses they 
design, movie directors don’t shoot and edit their own motion 
pictures, and even Damien Hirst doesn’t paint his own spot 
paintings. It’s only down at the craft level – of illustrators, 
potters, jewellers and the like – that designers actually make 
things these days.
Of course, in the past designers have had lots of excuses 
not to learn code. The internet was designed by scientists, 	
for scientists. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide 
Web, worked at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle 
Physics. His main concern was to share research data with 
other professionals. When designers discovered the web, they 
had to adapt it to their needs, using workarounds and hacks 	
to make the web do what they wanted it to do. And they still do, 
if they wish their layouts to make sense in older browsers.
But the amazing thing about modern computing is that it 
gives total control over the design process back to designers. 
Web designers can create entire websites without leaving their 
computer desks. It started with desktop publishing, when such 
programs as QuarkXPress enabled graphic designers to be 
responsible again for the whole design-to-production cycle, 
free from their layouts being reinterpreted and altered by outside 
typesetters, repro houses and printers. Musicians, who used to 
have to hire expensive studio time, can now create high-quality 
compositions in their own bedrooms. Photographers can 
produce stunning prints without the need for messy chemicals 
and darkroom equipment. Digital technology has democratized 
design. A solitary designer can take on the big studios and 
agencies on that mythical level playing field – and win.
Many designers will of course work for big studios, where 
the workflow is fragmented into distinct job descriptions; 
freelancers have to learn to do everything well. Splitting the 
duties among, for example, designers who mock-up pages 	
in Photoshop and coders who then try to make them work is 	
a backwards step into the days before computers, in that the 
design integrity can be lost when the coder is tempted to 
tweak the designer’s concepts. This book, surprisingly, is not 
aimed at hardcore techie web designers – there are plenty of 
manuals out there for them. Of course, I’m not advocating that 
designers should code complex corporate and e-commerce 
websites themselves; there is nothing wrong with co-opting 
specialized help when you need it. But with an understanding of 
the medium and the tools of the trade – a working knowledge 	
of HTML and CSS – you will produce, I argue, better, more 
thoughtful and ultimately more successful designs.

With the web well into what the community describes as version 2.0, 	
it has never been easier to create a worldwide presence. The internet 	
is now a key part of almost everyone’s life, and for graphic designers 
particularly it is part of their toolbox and a source of potential income. 
But what is the best way of designing websites? 
You will probably already have a Facebook profile to keep in touch 
with friends, you might store your photographs on a site such as Flickr, 
and you likely use Twitter or MySpace – so you already know the basics. 
You may even have a blog, which is probably the quickest and cheapest 
way to create a personal website (Fig 1.1) and can be customized beyond 
recognition (see Step-by-step 1 on pages 46–49). Every designer should 
have one, whether it be standalone or the ‘news’ segment of a more 
conventional website. Sooner or later, however, especially if you are thinking 
of creating websites for clients, you will have to learn some code.
People approaching website design for the first time may easily be 
discouraged by the complexity of web design programs such as Adobe 
Dreamweaver. It may be tempting to enrol on an expensive Dreamweaver 
course and embark on a steep learning curve to be able to design the 
simplest site. And while this will expand your skillset and help with job 
prospects, initially it is not always necessary. Learn a program, and you 
may be locked in to using that program to the exclusion of all others. 
Learn about web design and you can pick and choose the tools to use. 
In Chapter 2 we jump right in at the deep end and demonstrate how 
you can hand-code a simple website in less than a day.

Chapter 1
What is the 
internet?
1.2 Long-established Los Angeles-based design community website QBN (Quality 
Broadcasting Network) is a resource centre and discussion board for news, chat and – 
with companion site krop.com – creative industry jobs and portfolio housing
were made in 1973: to University College, London, and the 
Royal Radar Establishment in Norway.
In September 1973, Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf started work 
formulating the international standard set of rules for network 
communication, the Internet Protocol Suite TCP/IP, based 	
on two protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and 
Internet Protocol (IP). These were finally published in September 
1981, became the standard internet protocols in January 1983, 
and are still used today.
The internet was opened up to commercial networks, such 
as CompuServe and America OnLine (AOL), in 1991, and 
continues to grow. The number of computers on the internet 
reached a million in 1992. At the time of writing, more than 1.5 
billion people worldwide use the internet.
The internet is simply a global network of computers, and a 
means of connecting your computer, TV or mobile device to 
other computers. It is merely a medium. But on the internet we 
find lots of useful tools, the main ones being email (electronic 
mail), the World Wide Web (WWW) and, to a lesser extent 
these days, Usenet newsgroups.
Email allows you to send and receive messages and digital 
attachments – anything from computer-generated images, 
scanned photographs and artwork to sound samples – to and 
from anywhere in the world.
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of ‘pages’, 
probably running into several billions by now, viewed using a 
browser such as Safari or Firefox and containing text, images, 
sound, movies and, most importantly, ‘hot links’ to other 
pages. You can also use some WWW pages interactively to 
communicate with, say, online stores or galleries. Webmail 	
(e.g. Gmail, Hotmail) enables you to access your email on a 
browser from any computer.
Newsgroups are online bulletin boards or discussion 
groups that enable you to have conversations with other people. 
This role has largely been taken over by web-based forums.
For the designer, the internet is a cheap and fast way to 
send artwork to the client and the printer. It is also an inexpensive 
and effective way to advertise yourself and your work worldwide. 
Third, it is a potentially huge source of new clients and job 
opportunities (Fig 1.2).
The evolution of the internet
In 1962, the US military set up ARPAnet (Advanced Research 
Projects Agency) with the aim of improving the military’s use 	
of computer technology. ARPAnet initially connected together 
four computers at sites around the USA, the first node being 
installed at the University of California in Los Angeles in September 
1969. This was made possible by ‘packet switching’, in which 
messages are broken down into ‘packets’ and sent off by 
different routes towards their destination, where they are 
eventually reassembled. Paul Baran of the Rand Corporation 
had published such a scheme in 1964. The National Physical 
Laboratory in the UK set up the first test network based on 
these principles in 1968.
ARPAnet was designed from the outset to be both resilient 
and decentralized, so as to ensure that communications would 
keep flowing even if parts of the network were destroyed – in  
a nuclear war, for example. By 1971 approximately 20 nodes 
had been installed. International connections to the ARPAnet

Introduction and background
Usenet (Unix User Network) was established in 1979 – long 
before the World Wide Web appeared – between Duke 
University and the University of North Carolina for the exchanging 
of news and views. The original programs were written by 
graduate student Steve Bellovin. These were then rewritten 
and extended by Steve Daniel and Tom Truscott.
Usenet is an example of a client–server architecture. You 
(the client) connect to a machine (the server) where the Usenet 
postings are stored. You can look at the headings of postings 
in the newsgroups of interest, and then request the full text 	
of a particular posting (message or article) to be forwarded to 	
a newsreader program on your machine. You may then read 	
or store the article, reply directly to the poster via email, or 	
post a follow-up article (starting or joining a ‘thread’). You can 	
also initiate a new subject heading with a new posting. The 
program keeps track of which articles you have already read.
At the time of writing, there were more than 100,000 
different newsgroups, many of them inactive, covering everything 
from keeping fish (rec.aquaria.freshwater.goldfish) to font 
design (comp.fonts). They have largely been superseded by 
forums on the World Wide Web (see below), which share many 
of the attributes of newsgroups, such as topics and threads, 
but are mostly overseen by a moderator, and you may need to 
register and join before you can participate in discussions. 
Netiquette
Network etiquette, or netiquette, is something that a newbie 
(new user) will come across sooner or later. Newbies are 
encouraged to lurk for a while (a lurker is someone who reads 
but never posts) and to consult the newsgroup’s FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) list before posting for the first time.
Postings that are off-topic often elicit a flaming, or bashing. 
Cross-posting (posting the same message to numerous groups) 
is particularly frowned upon, but real venom is reserved for 
spamming (from the Monty Python ‘Spam’ song in the sketch 
of the same name). Spam initially described a carelessly 
inappropriate message or advertisement posted to many 
different groups or individuals, and is now a general term for 
unwanted or malicious mass-marketing. Messages set all in 
capitals (interpreted as ‘shouting’) or with over-long signatures 
(especially ones containing so-called ASCII art – pictures made 
up of text characters) are discouraged, but it is considered very 
bad form to criticize a poster’s poor grammar or spelling. The 
latest versions of email and news-reading programs have useful 
‘kill files’ and spam filters, which weed out unwanted messages.
Newsgroups
In October 1963, computer-consulting company Bolt, Beranek 
and Newman (BBN) published a paper demonstrating that 
users could communicate remotely with computers using 
ordinary telephone lines. BBN had already patented the modem 
earlier that year.
In 1971, Ray Tomlinson of BBN sent the first-ever network 
email, over two computers connected by ARPAnet: he is also 
responsible for the @ sign in an email address. By the second 
year of ARPAnet’s operation, the main traffic was news and 
personal messages. Researchers were using the network not 
only to collaborate on projects and trade notes on work, but 	
to gossip. People had their own personal user accounts on the 
ARPAnet computers, and their own personal addresses for 
electronic mail. It was not long before the invention of the mailing 
list, with which a message could be broadcast to anyone 
subscribing to a particular list.
Email addresses take the form username@site.dom, in 
which username is your name or a chosen nickname, site 
locates your ISP (Internet Service Provider), or server computer, 
and dom is a domain type, possibly including subdomains. 
These are all separated by full points. 
Top-level domain types include .com for commercial 
organizations and .edu for educational institutions. Note that 
most of the sites in the .com and .edu domains are in the USA. 
Outside these functional domains, sites in the USA have the 	
.us domain, with subdomains for the 50 states, each generally 
with a name identical to the state’s postal abbreviation (note 
that .ca can be both California and Canada, depending on the 
context). Within the .uk domain, there is a .ac subdomain for 
academic sites and a .co domain for commercial ones. See 
page 18 for how to choose your own domain name and the 
advantages of doing this.
Email and messaging in its broadest sense now include 
webmail (e.g. Hotmail, Gmail), as well as Facebook and Flickr 
messaging and Twitter tweets.
	
Country codes
	
Each country has its own two-letter domain: Spain, for example, is .es, 	
	
Germany is .de, India is .in,  Austria is .at and so on (full list at www.iana.	
	
org). If your name ends with ‘es’, for example, you may be able to 	
	
buy a domain such as alanpip.es with which to impress your friends. 
	
Some countries, however, will issue such domains only to people or 	
	
organizations resident in that country, so check with your domain 	
	
supplier. Other unusual country domains have been appropriated by 	
	
particular industries or trades, for example domains ending .tv for Tuvalu 	
	
(a Polynesian island), are popular with companies in the television industry.

Introduction and background
Abbreviations and emoticons
Because of the need to conserve bandwidth, and for speed of 
typing, many abbreviations are in common use. Here are a few 
you may encounter:
And because gestures or inflections of speech are impossible 
on the net, symbols made from text characters, called 
emoticons or smileys, have evolved. These are particularly 
useful to avoid causing offence – your harmless joke may be 
taken literally, but a ;-) smiley makes everything okay! The most 
common are opposite (turn your head 90 degrees to the left).
While a consultant for CERN (the European Laboratory for 
Particle Physics) in 1980, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a hypertext-
based program called ‘Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything’. In 1990, 
he coined the name World Wide Web (WWW) and, with Robert 
Cailliau as co-author, he developed the first WWW program. In 
1993, CERN placed this software in the public domain.
That same year, a group of graduate students from the 
University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana developed Mosaic, 
a software package that used the WWW protocol. Mosaic was 
a major factor in the explosion of business interest on the 
internet, because it made the internet accessible to inexperienced 
users. Many other browsers have evolved since Mosaic’s 
development, including its direct descendant Mozilla Firefox 
and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.
The World Wide Web is a huge collection of interconnected 
pages. Many sites encourage or require you to register (giving 
them valuable marketing information). Your ISP or college may 
provide you with disk space on their server for a home page 
and there are many sites around the world that offer free 
space. These can be used as test areas to develop your web 
design skills.
The WWW is based on a client–server model where the 
client (your browser) communicates with the servers (the sites 
storing the web pages you want to view) using mainly HTTP 
(Hypertext Transport Protocol). HTML (Hypertext Markup 
Language) is used to create and communicate the page. The 
address of a page, or its URL (Uniform Resource Locator), 	
is generally of the form: http://www.yourisp.com/username/
index.html.
Technically, the ‘www’ part of the URL is a subdomain, and 
as such could be anything you choose: ‘www1’ and ‘www2’, 
for example, are used by large organizations to share traffic 
among different servers. The ‘www’ at present distinguishes 	
a web address from, say, an FTP address (see page 17), but 	
is largely redundant and you will see more and more websites 
abandoning it in the future. Try typing in your URL without the 
‘www’ and it will probably work just as well.
Web standards
What are standards and why are they important? Without 
standard weights and measurements everyday life would be 
chaos and the mass-production of goods impossible. Time was 
standardized when the users of railways demanded accurate 
timetables. So it is with web standards – they ensure everyone 
is singing from the same hymn sheet.

Chapter 1
The World Wide Web is a wonderful opportunity for the graphic 
designer, but it does have some curious challenges. For a 
start, until recently you did not have a great deal of control 	
over how your designs and layouts would be seen. It is only 
possible to specify fonts that the user already has installed on 
their computer, and you can be reasonably certain only that 
they will have a subset of the most common fonts (see p90). You 
also have little control over what size they will be viewed at or 
the measure used. You have to accept that your design is going 
to appear differently on different browsers and on different 
machines (for an example of fluid design that works with these 
variables see Fig 1.3.) On the upside, some designers find these 
constraints liberating, plus you don’t have to worry about the 
resolution and format of images (everything is 72dpi) or about 
print production. Moreover, since the RGB (red, green, blue) colour 
model is used, which has a bigger gamut than CMYK (cyan, 
magenta, yellow, key or black) used in print, you can choose 
from more colours. The web is in many ways an ideal publishing 
medium: it is inexpensive (almost free), global, instantaneous, 
and, despite what was said earlier, extremely versatile.
So what is there left for the designer to do? Basically what 
all graphic designers do all the time: communicate the client’s 
message in the most effective way; make it easy for the user 	
to navigate around the site; and make the pages distinctive, 
attractive, eye-catching and entertaining. The web is a great 
leveller – college students and graduates have (almost) exactly 
the same tools available to them as the most prestigious design 
groups working for the largest multinationals.
Perhaps the biggest difference between designing for print 
and designing for the web is that the layouts for a book or 
magazine are, broadly speaking, designed in a linear fashion: 
readers are expected to start at the beginning and work their 
way through to the end. In interactive media such as the WWW, 
the reader is encouraged to leap from one hot link to another, 
so the organization of pages is important. The reader may enter 
any page in your site from an outside link, so every page must 
be self-contained with all the navigational aids necessary to help 
them carry on surfing. An initial concept plan with flowcharts 
and maybe a storyboard is essential. WWW designers need 
directorial skills too – with sound and animation available, you 
may well be asked to coordinate the efforts of a whole team 	
of other professionals.
Designing 
for the World 
Wide Web
There are two kinds of standards: de facto standards, 
which are introduced by commercial companies or research 
organizations and eventually become accepted by the community 
– PDF (Portable Document Format) is an example; and 
standards established by international committees of experts 
and interested parties. In web design that means the W3C 
(World Wide Web Consortium) founded by Tim Berners-Lee 	
in 1994 and based jointly at MIT and other locations around the 
world. The W3C doesn’t actually invent the standards – the 
technical specifications for various developments come from 
many different sources and the W3C has the role of endorsing 
the best of them. Recommendations are discussed and after 	
a lengthy process become published standards.
When a website is said to comply with web standards, it 
means that the site or page has valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
according to the published standard, and that this can be 
tested by the W3C’s validation services. Commercial companies 
such as Adobe often develop programs ahead of standards 
and thus code produced by proprietary software such as 
Adobe’s web design program Dreamweaver may not be totally 
standard. The standards committees are forever playing 
catch-up with commercial developments and this is something 
everyone has learned to live with.

Chapter 1
As mentioned earlier, the websites you create have to ‘live’ 
somewhere. It might be possible to configure your home 
computer to become a server, but it would have to be connected 
to the internet 24 hours a day. Your service provider would 
probably not allow it (or charge you a lot for the privilege) and, 	
in any case, to host a domain (see page 18) you would need to 
run at least two servers. It is far easier – and cheaper – to use a 
third-party hosting service. Your ISP, the company you connect 
to the internet through, probably allocates you some disk space 
for personal use, and this is fine for a home page or a simple 
non-commercial site. But if you suddenly become a success 
and start getting lots of hits, with your site starting to use more 
of their bandwidth to cope, they will soon be contacting you 	
for more money.
One of the earliest third-party hosting services was GeoCities, 
a Utopian attempt to set up an online community. Founded by 
David Bohnett and John Rezner in 1994 as Beverly Hills Internet, 
it was taken over by Yahoo! in 1999 and closed in 2009. 
GeoCities was organized thematically into ‘neighbourhoods’: for 
example, computer-related sites were located in Silicon Valley, 
entertainment sites were assigned to Hollywood, and artists 
and writers lived in SoHo. The idea was that neighbouring 
homesteaders would interact with each other, providing a virtual 
support and networking community. It was ahead of its time, 
anticipating the interactive nature of Web 2.0, and in 1999, 	
at the peak of the dot-com boom, GeoCities was the third 
most-visited website on the WWW. But being a free service, it 
failed to make any money for its new owners, and Yahoo! has 
since been encouraging GeoCities users to migrate to its paid 
hosting service. 
However, there are still numerous free hosting services, for 
example, www.110mb.com and www.freevirtualservers.com 
(Fig 1.4). The reason for choosing these particular examples is 
because they offer something called SSI (Server Side Includes), 
which we will be looking at in Chapter 6 (see page 134). Make 
sure that any hosting service you decide to use also offers FTP 
access (see opposite) and gives you the amount of space, 
bandwidth and reliability you need – you may have to make 
small one-off payments or upgrade to a monthly paid contract 
to get all the features you require. Some free hosts will put 
advertisements on your site, or ask that you purchase a domain 
from them (see page 18).
One downside of using free hosting is that they are 
sometimes used to host illegal pornography and other criminal 
sites. When certain ISPs detect this is happening, they may 
blacklist the IP (Internet Protocol) address of that part of the
Hosts and 
hosting
www.freevirtualservers.com
1.4 There are many ‘free’ hosting and domain sites on the internet, but, like low-cost 
airlines, they may start off being free but to become functional their one-off fees and upgrade 
subscriptions can begin to add up 
host’s server that you may be sharing with the criminals – every 
website has a numerical address of the form 174.142.109.139 
– and your site will go down (disappear from view) until the 
host weeds out and expels the perpetrators, and the ISP 
deems the host is safe enough to allow its customers to see.

17
Introduction and background
When you have finished designing your website, you will need 
to transfer it from your computer to the host’s server. Although 
most free hosting services provide a browser-based form-style 
system to do this, you might only be allowed to upload files one 
by one, which can become very tedious and time-consuming. 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a long-established means of 
transferring files between computers and its most obvious use 
is to upload your files to the host server.
FTP has other uses too. There are many sites around the 
internet from which users can download programs, documents 
and images. Mirror sites keep copies of the files from the main 
sites, and if there is one geographically closer to you, it may 
well be faster and more responsive than the main site. You may 
also wish to upload large files to a client’s computer – several 
print-resolution images, for example – and large email 
attachments can easily exceed the capacity of someone’s inbox. 
Most web design programs, such as Dreamweaver, have 
built-in FTP; Apple’s OS also has FTP available. There are also 
standalone FTP programs, such as Transmit and Fetch (Fig 1.5). 
FTP: Uploading 
and downloading
Programs such as Transmit do one simple job well, showing 
two columns of files: ‘your stuff’ (corresponding to what is on 
your hard drive) and ‘their stuff’ (corresponding to what is on 
the host’s server). To upload files, connect to the hosting server 
using the address and password supplied (see page 18), and 
simply drag and drop files from your stuff to their stuff; to 
download files, simply drag and drop files from their stuff to 
your stuff. The log-in details for different hosts are stored as 	
a list of favourites.
1.5 An FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program 
such as Transmit focuses on one task, 
uploading and downloading files from your 
computer to others. Its main use is to 
upload your website files to a host’s server

Chapter 1
founded in 1996 after its predecessor, a voluntary ‘Naming 
Committee’, was unable to cope with demand. Customers 
registering a domain, however, do not normally approach 
Nominet directly, but apply via a ‘registrar’ such as www.
freevirtualservers.com. Once registered you will be asked by 
Nominet to confirm your details and will later receive a 
Registration Certificate. 
In the United States, domains ending in .com and other 
top-level domains were registered exclusively with Network 
Solutions, Inc. (later taken over by VeriSign) until 1997 when 
monopoly legislation forced them to reduce their ‘excessive’ 
fees and open up registration to competition. Thus, the difference 
between ‘wholesale’ and ‘retail’ registrar companies is not as 
clear-cut as it is in the UK. Overseeing these companies is an 
organization called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned 
Names and Numbers). The leading ICANN-accredited registrar 
is Go Daddy, followed by eNom, Tucows (also known for 	
its website directory of shareware) and Australian company 
Melbourne IT.
Although it is convenient to buy both web hosting and 
domain hosting from the same vendor, it is often safer to use 
two separate companies, to avoid hidden costs if at a future 
date you decided to move the website and/or domain to 
another hosting company. Using a hosting service without 
So, let’s take the plunge and open an imaginary account for a 
photographer with www.freevirtualservers.com. After the usual 
form-filling and choosing of passwords (if you write them down 
keep them in a safe but secret place) we discover that there is 
a small one-off set-up fee, and that they require you to buy a 
domain from them. We were going to buy a domain anyway, 
so after checking with them that janedoephotography.co.uk is 
available, we pay for two years. You can also check the 
availability of domains on www.who.is, where we found that 
www.janedoephotography.com is already taken (Fig 1.6).
From their welcome email we receive the settings we need 
to put into the FTP program, which are as follows:
Server address: ftp.janedoephotography.co.uk  
(or 67.18.242.98)
FTP username: t15jane
FTP password: ******
Starting directory: /public_html
However, until we reach the end of Chapter 2, we do not 
yet have a website to upload, so will leave it there for now.
Domains ending in .co.uk (i.e. UK-based companies) and 
other .uk domains are looked after by an organization called 
Nominet. This private, not-for-profit membership company was 
Domains
1.6 Who.is can be used to check 
whether a domain is still available to 	
buy – it also gives details of who owns 	 	
a particular domain
http://who.is/

19
Introduction and background
having to buy a domain from it means you can store several 
websites using the same hosting account, all in separate 
folders on the server.
For example, you might set up a free hosting account 	
with www.freewebhostingarea.com and the address of your 
website would be http://janedoephotography.ueuo.com.  
This may be good enough for you to start with, but you then 
might buy a better domain from Go Daddy or Freeparking, 
such as janedoephotography.net (be aware that all obvious 
straightforward domains, such as jane-doe.com, will probably 
already have been snapped up). Domain names can include 
only letters and numbers, plus hyphens – no spaces or fancy 
characters allowed. So try a few combinations, until you find 
one that works for you. For example, at the time of writing 
this, jane-doe-photography.com is still available.
Linking to your website
Once you have registered the domain, you can link it to  
your website in one of two different ways. The first is called 
web forwarding. 
After logging on, I navigate to My Domains>Maintain a 
Domain, then click on Edit Domain Name Properties. You will 
see that the domain is being redirected to the home page’s 
‘real’ address, for example from http://www.belengomez.com/ 
to http://homepage.ntlworld.com/urbantree/belen-gomez/
index.html, where the website is hosted. A user typing www.
belengomez.com into a browser, or finding it via a search 
engine, will be unaware that a redirection has taken place.  
If you decide to change hosts, all you need do is change the 
address in the Use Web Forwarding box. This technique also 
works with email: redirect your mail to your domain – for 
example info@belengomez.com – and your mail will always find 
you – see the tip box on page 21.
One disadvantage of simple web forwarding is that your 
actual website is ‘masked’ in a frameset that can confuse the 
search engines, hence there are fields available for adding 
description and keyword meta-tags. You can see the code for 
these frames if you View Source in the browser (Fig 1.7). For 
better control, we can use the Manage Your Own DNS Zone 
File section (Fig 1.8). Here we need to enter the IP address of 
the new web server (which you must find out from your new 
host), of the form 72.1.201.156, plus maybe the names of their 
primary and secondary name servers. For example, the name 
servers for the web hosting company 1&1 are of the form 
ns59.1and1.co.uk and ns60.1and1.co.uk. Every domain must 
http://www.belengomez.com/
http://www.belengomez.com/

by the domain host’s frameset, which could confuse the search engines

Introduction and background
1.8 With DNS control, the address that 
appears in the address bar of the browser 
is that of your domain and nobody is the 
wiser as to where it really resides. Large 
multinational stores like Uniqlo, however, 
are more likely to have their own real or 
virtual servers
exist on at least two different servers (known as primary and 
secondary). With this method, the individual addresses of each 
page of the website using the better domain will appear in the 
address bar of the browser.
Larger companies and organizations are more likely to have 
their own servers, or to rent virtual servers from a third-party 
host, so they will have fewer problems displaying the domain 
name as they would like it. Virtual servers exist in their own 
enclosed space within a bigger server, bridging the gap between 
inexpensive or free shared web hosting, as described earlier, 
and much more expensive dedicated servers that only a 
multinational could afford.
	
Use your domain email address
	
It is surprising how many people buy a domain for their website but 	
	
never get round to using the email that comes with it. Using your domain 	
	
for email a) looks more professional than using a Hotmail, Gmail or 	
	
similar account and b) means that if you change your ISP or leave 	
	
college, you won’t have to inform all your friends and contacts that 
	
you have a new email address. If you have bought a domain, such 
	
as janedoephotography.co.uk, then your email can be anything@	
	
janedoephotography.co.uk, where anything means anything. Most 	
	
people would choose info@janedoephotography.co.uk, or a more 	
	
personal jane@janedoephotography.co.uk. Just go into the Manage 	
	
Domains part of your domain host’s site and set the email forwarding 
	
to your current ‘real’ email address. As with a PO Box number, the 
	
host forwards to your address and if you later move, you just set it 	
	
to your new address and your email stays the same.
Web design for 
graphic designers
So far, we have not talked about design. Graphic designers 
used to working in print will notice a few challenges when 
moving to web design. When you design a brochure, for example, 
you can be sure that every one of them will look the same once 
printed. The fonts will be the ones you chose, in the sizes you 
specified, and all the elements will be in the positions you placed 
them. In web design, you have less control. The fonts will be 
whatever the end-user has installed on their computer, although 
there are methods to expand the range of fonts available (see 
Chapter 4). The layout might be different depending on the size 
of the screen, the browser used, or whether the computer is a 
Mac or a PC.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that the web has 
many advantages over print. It is instant, so you can publish as 
soon as everything is in place. And if you make a mistake, you 
will not have to pay for a new print-run – corrections can be made 
quickly and uploaded at any time. All the images are in RGB, 
which has a bigger gamut than CMYK, so will be more faithful 
to your vision, and at 72dpi, they will be much smaller files than 
print-resolution pictures. But best of all, the text can be made 
interactive, by adding hot links to other pages or sites, and there 
is the possibility of adding sound and movies to the mix. Your 
customers worldwide will be able to give feedback, via email or 
comments on blog entries – and you can sell and distribute your 
merchandise through an e-shop. There is no expensive 
equipment to buy or hire either.
Designers previously had to resort to tricks and workarounds 
to get the results they wanted (and to some extent, they still do). 
The web was invented by scientists to share academic 
knowledge, and presentation was not a big priority. However, 
with the advent of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets: see Chapter 3) 
there is now a great toolbox that designers can use to realize 
their designs. Before, to have control over, say, which fonts 
appeared, text would have to be turned into pictures, which 
meant that files were bigger and also, with no real text, virtually 
invisible to the search engines. Or some designers would use 
programs such as Adobe Director, more suited to audio-visual 
applications like CD-ROMs or DVDs, to produce what were 
effectively online slide shows. Adobe Flash (see Chapter 6), 	
a program similar in feel to Director but more geared towards 
animated websites, is still used to achieve similar interactivity, 
but the end-user has to download a plug-in to view it. Using 
Director, which also required downloading a ShockWave plug-in, 
was disastrous for any form of accessibility, such as talking 
websites for visually impaired people. It also made printing off 
pages a problem. 

22
Chapter 1
Layout was another challenge. Apart from the strategy of 
turning page layouts into large pictures containing images and 
text, the limitations of web design could be overcome by using 
framesets (now largely out of fashion, except for some special 
cases that will be discussed later) or tables, spaced out using 
invisible transparent image files, usually GIFs. Dreamweaver 
worked this way until recent versions embraced CSS.
Successful design
To make a website that is so appealing and exciting that 
viewers will want to return to it over and over again is the Holy 
Grail of web design. Of course, the content – the pictures and 
words – is paramount, but how it is presented is also vitally 
important. How you achieve the perfect match of content and 
presentation is down to the fundamentals discussed throughout 
this book: layout, colour schemes, typography and usability.
Although it may not be spelt out explicitly, the box model 
of layout used by CSS harks back to the Swiss International 
style of the 1960s, with its grid-based designs. There is 
something pleasing about the edges of images and blocks 	
of text lining up along the lines of an underlying grid, and the 
consistency it commits you to is also a positive discipline. 
Design theory books talk about the Golden Section and the 
Rule of Thirds when laying out material in a harmonious way.  
In web design this is not so easy – the canvas you have to 
work on is dictated by the shapes and sizes of users’ computer 
screens, or their mobile device – and with fluid design, their 
relative sizes and positions can also change as a user resizes 	
a browser window. 
The best you can do is place the important elements above 
the ‘fold’ in the top of the screen area. Within that space, you 
can size text areas and images in proportion to one another. 
Keep out any clutter, especially fussy background images, and 
restrict yourself to just one or two fonts (Fig 1.9). A consistent 
image width can also prevent a jarring change of layout as users 
move from page to page.
Usability guru Steve Grug implores web designers: ‘Don’t 
make me think!’ He says that the test of a good website is that 
it should be self-evident, obvious, self-explanatory. ‘I should be 
able to “get it” – what it is and how to use it – without expending 
any effort thinking about it.’ So be nice to your public and 
don’t make them work too hard. 
Making a design self-evident is not that difficult, but is 
ignored at your peril. Simple, clear navigation that uses 
straightforward names for links and headings, and concise text  
http://www.graphicsafari.blogspot.com/
1.9 Graphic Safari is an example of a simple, uncluttered Blogger-powered blog that can 
be accessed from the main menu of the Milan-based design studio La Tigre (latigre.net) 
and is used to showcase a range of the studio’s latest projects 
that gets to the point straight away, may seem obvious but it 	
is surprising how many designers seem to want to tease their 
audience, obfuscating content and hiding menus. People with 
time on their hands might appreciate the entertainment factor, 
but in reality most are on the web to obtain information quickly 
and may not ‘get’ your subtle concept.
Subtlety in the right context can be a good thing, however. 
Your target audience is a factor when choosing colour schemes. 
Says Leatrice Eiseman in Hillman Curtis’s excellent and inspiring 
book MTIV (‘Making the Invisible Visible’): ‘What am I trying to 
sell to the viewer? Should I shout to gain their attention, or will 
a more subtle approach be more in tune with the intended 
message?’ Good designers ask questions like this and try to 
put themselves in the place of the intended user. Put yourself 
in your followers’ shoes and ponder what you can add to 	
their lives. What works for an emo youth audience might be 
inappropriate for a high street bank – or maybe not? Rules, 
once learnt, can always be broken.

Introduction and background
Browser 
compatibility
A big bugbear that remains is browser compatibility. A browser, 
such as Safari or Firefox, comes between your website and the 
end-user. It translates and interprets your website, parsing the 
code, to produce a formatted web page. Because proprietary 
browsers are in competition with each other, all wanting to add 
features that the others don’t have, they will all interpret your 
designs slightly differently. And those small differences could 
make or break your design. Older versions of Internet Explorer, 
for example, often cause difficulties, and workarounds have to 
be devised to cater for them. Because there are many end-users 
out there who do not upgrade to the latest versions of software, 
a good rule of thumb is to design your sites to work on the 	
last two versions of major browsers. If you do not have all the 
browsers installed on your computer, or both a Mac and PC to 
test on, websites such as browsershots.org are useful (Fig 1.10).
If your cutting-edge website renders improperly or not at all, 
your reputation will suffer, and visitors and potential customers 
will leave your site and may never return. A professional-looking 
site should make visitors feel comfortable, so they will linger 
longer, browse more pages – and be more likely to purchase 
the client’s products and use your services.
Tough decisions have to be made: do you try to make 
your designs cross-browser, i.e. working in every single browser 
ever invented? Or multi-browser, i.e. working with the majority 
of modern browsers? In any case your design should be 
failsafe, so that if it does fail in a given browser, the end-user 
can still at least access the content in a structured way.
Modern methodologies of web design such as CSS aim  
to allow that anyway, by separating the content from its 
appearance. The ambition is to achieve ‘elegant degradation’ 
(also known as fail-safe) – the term comes from engineering, 
where a machine or system is designed to break down slowly 
rather than catastrophically. In web design, the layout and CSS 
should be such that if an older browser or user’s computer 
doesn’t support a particular tag or font, then the website will 
still make sense. It won’t look as good, but the content will all 
be available, in the right order. 
CSS is now recommended by the major supervisory 
bodies and organizations involved with the World Wide Web.  
It has great benefits with the newer browsers, as well as for 
mobile phones, iPods and netbooks. These generally have 
small touch screens, so websites viewed on them need to be 
both legible and useable. These considerations will be explored 
in greater detail later in the book.
CSS for layout will be discussed in Chapter 3, but first we 
shall look at the basics of HTML coding.
1.10 Browser compatibility can be 
checked in a website such as 
browsershots.org – using the new features 
of the latest browsers can play havoc with 
older browsers, which may not be able to 
render the website at all

Code
In this age of Web 2.0 – Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, MySpace – websites 
have become increasingly sophisticated. The code behind such sites as 
these is daunting – to see what it looks like, choose View Source from 
your browser’s menu (Fig 2.1). You may be surprised, then, to find that 	
it is possible to create a simple website completely by hand, using only 	
a text editor. Of course, it is also possible to walk coast-to-coast across 
the USA, but you may wish to do it only once! Similarly, it is a valuable 
exercise to try writing code by hand, without software help, but I promise 
you won’t need to do it ever again.
2.1 The great thing about web design is 
that you can see how websites are 
created by looking at View Source in your

is to strip out any curly quotes, dashes and other formatting, to 
replace them with the feet (') and inches (") and simple hyphens 
that the code will understand. 
A simple web page will comprise a text document plus GIF 
and/or JPEG files all in the same directory (equivalent to a Mac 
folder), or preferably with the images in a subfolder, named 
‘images’. You will also need a graphics program, such as 
Adobe Photoshop, that can export GIF and JPEG files. And 
finally, you will need FTP access to your host’s server – you can 
create the pages on your computer, but for anyone else to be 
able to see them they must be ‘published’ by uploading them.
If you examine the source code of an HTML web page, 
you will see that all pages have the same underlying structure. 
They divide into two main sections: head and body. The first 
(home or start) page of a website is traditionally called ‘index.
html’ (on Windows servers, index.htm and even default.htm 
are also allowable), and it looks like this:
<html>
<head>
<title> The text that appears top of the browser window is 
here.</title>
</head>
<body>
Main content is here.
</body>
</html>
Tags
The words in angled brackets (the < ‘less than’ and > ‘greater 
than’ symbols) are called ‘tags’ and usually come in pairs that 
enclose the text affected, the closing tag being preceded by a 
forward slash. An important exception is the tag for line break, 
which is placed at the end of a line. It used to be written <br>, 
but it is now written <br />. The tag <html> surrounds 	
the entire document to tell the browser to expect an HTML 
document. Strictly speaking, the document should also have 	
a ‘DOCTYPE’ declaration at the top of the document, such as 
<!DOCTYPE html>. Apart from the title, anything appearing 
in the <head> section will be invisible to the viewer. What you 
see in the browser window will be contained in the <body> 
section. A complete list of tags is provided on page 165.
The code or programming language we are going to use here 
is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), or more strictly speaking, 
XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language), which became 
W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)-recommended in 2000. 	
A website that conforms to an XHTML specification is said to be 
valid. Any document can be checked for validity with the W3C 
Markup Validation Service. One of the differences between HTML 
and XHTML is that the latter is case-sensitive: tags in XHTML 
should always be lower case. Other differences, such as the 
closing of ‘empty’ tags, will be mentioned as we encounter them. 
Be aware also that to write validating code you must make 
sure you use the terms and syntax exactly as they are defined 
– even if you are a French-speaker writing code for a French 
website – and note the American-English spelling of the words 
‘color’ and ‘center’.
There are several very good standalone wysiwyg (‘what you 
see is what you get’) web design programs, such as Dreamweaver, 
that claim that you can design web pages without ever having 
to come into contact with HTML code – after all, you don’t 
need to be able to program in PostScript to lay out pages in 
QuarkXPress or InDesign. In practice, however, it helps to have 
a working knowledge of HTML to be able to troubleshoot the 
code if something peculiar happens in your design. Dreamweaver 
can toggle between the layout and code, or show them both in 
one window. Some programs never allow you to look at the code. 
One of these is Freeway, for the Mac, which has a QuarkXPress 
feel to it, with a pasteboard, master pages and text boxes. It 
can import Photoshop images and convert them to GIFs or 
JPEGs (more later). And when you have finished, the program 
‘compiles’ and exports (and FTPs) the entire website.
Most websites are now so complex that it would not be 
economical to write the code by hand, and programs such as 
Dreamweaver are essential if you are working with free-form 
layouts using tables and frames, with mouse rollovers and other 
JavaScript effects, or developing database-driven e-commerce 
sites. Nevertheless, a knowledge of basic HTML will pay dividends. 
Putting a document online
Let’s say you want to put a brief profile online to attract potential 
clients (Fig 2.2). You will probably already have a version as a 
Microsoft Word or rich text file (RTF) document. To create the 
code we will use a text editor such as TextEdit on a Mac or 
Notepad on a Windows PC. More sophisticated word-processing 
programs such as Word often automatically anticipate what 
they think you want, and the first job, if your profile is in Word,

means of communicating skills and

Chapter 2
First we add <p> paragraph tags and <br /> line breaks. 
Without these tags, all the lines of text would run into each 
other, creating one solid block. The browser would ignore all 
the line spaces and carriage returns you’ve carefully added to 
your text document to give it an attractive layout. So, when 
writing your code, use as much space as you like to separate 
the different sections.

Headings
There are six headings in html: h1 through h6. The default for 
an h1 heading is 24 pt Times bold. It is best always to start 
with an h1 heading, then h2 and so on, and not to skip levels. 
If you miss off the </h1> end tag, the whole document will be 
one big heading. Headings, like all the other tags, can be 
customized using CSS (see Chapter 3).
So, let’s add some content. First give the page a meaningful 
<title>, one that will make sense to a search engine and 	
will tell the viewer what it is they are looking at. Let’s try ‘Jane 
Doe Photographer’.
Here is our bare-bones ‘About me’ page. It could be longer, 
but as this is a demonstration project it will suffice.

Code
Character formatting
You can also make words bold or italic. HTML, however, has 
two classes of styles: logical and physical. Logical styles, such 
as <strong>, are used to tag the text according to its 
meaning, while physical styles, such as <b> for bold, are used 
to indicate the specific typographical appearance of the text.
Logical tags are supposed to help enforce consistency in 
your documents. Remember, the WWW was developed by 
scientists used to academic papers, not by graphic designers 
with their own needs. Most browsers render the <strong> 
tag in bold text. However, it is possible that a browser might 
display the word in bright red instead. If you want something to 
be displayed in, for example, bold and do not want a browser’s 
setting to display it differently, use physical styles. 
Try to be consistent about which type of style you use. 
Whether you tag with physical or logical styles, do so within the 
whole document. Here are some of the logical styles:
<em> for emphasis, typically displayed in italics
<strong> for strong emphasis, typically displayed in bold
And here are some examples of physical styles:
<b> bold text
<i> italic text
<tt> typewriter text, i.e. fixed-width font, for tabular matter
Entity codes
Three ASCII characters – the left angle bracket (<), the right 
angle bracket (>), and the ampersand (&) – are ‘reserved 
characters’ and have special meanings in HTML, and therefore 
cannot be used ‘as is’ in text. To use any of these in an HTML 
document, you must enter their code name or number instead 
(each starting with & and ending with ;) thus:
&lt; or &#60; for <
&gt; or &#62; for >
&amp; or &#38; for &
These ‘entities’ are also known as ‘escape sequences’. Other 
non-standard keyboard characters and maths symbols also 
need to be turned into code: for example, a £ sign should be 
written &pound; or &#163;. Unfortunately this applies to 
accented characters too; ‘crème brûlée’, for example, needs 
Anchors and links
The best thing about the web is that you can create hypertext 
‘hot links’, or hyperlinks, to other parts of your page, to other 
pages on your site, or to other unrelated pages on any another 
website anywhere in the world (see the tip box below).
A link has two ends – called anchors. The link starts at 
the source anchor, a hot spot on your page, and points to the 
destination anchor, which may be any web resource – an image, 
a video clip, a named spot on the same page or somewhere 
within your website, or an external HTML document. Anchors 
can be either local, relative ones pointing to another text file in 
the same directory, or absolute ones containing the full URL 
(Uniform Resource Locator) of the page you want to link to. An 
anchor is of the form:
<a href="url">the hot text</a>
where the URL is either relative (another page on the same 
site, for instance second-page.html) or absolute (for instance 
the URL of Jane Doe’s Flickr site – http://www.flickr.com/
people/janedoephotographer/). The a stands for ‘anchor’ and 
is used in different forms that we will see later; the href 
attribute defines the link ‘address’. A link to Jane Doe’s email 
address would be written: 
<a href="mailto:jane@janedoephotographer.com">jane@
janedoephotographer.com</a>
A link to Jane Doe’s Flickr site would be written:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/janedoephotographer/" 
target="_blank">Flickr</a>
Adding the optional target="_blank" to the link code opens 
the linked site in a new browser window of its own, leaving 
your site still in view.
	
Retaining your visitors
	
Adding external links to your website is generally a good thing. If you 	
	
link to someone and they link back to your site, then the search engines 	
	
will give you a higher rating. But you don’t want people leaving your site 	
	
as soon as they have arrived, so adding the expression target="_blank" 	
	
to the link code opens the linked site in a new browser window of its 	
	
own, leaving your site still in view.
	
<a href="http://www.external-site.com" target="_blank">An external link</a>

to be written cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e. 
Failure to substitute this code will result in spurious characters 
appearing in your text when the web page is uploaded to the 
server and interpreted by browsers. A full list can be found at 
www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_entities.asp, though most text 
editors aimed at helping with HTML, such as BBEdit or 
PageSpinner, will have them available.
Images 
To add or embed an image in a web page, we use the tag 
<img src="picture.gif">, where picture.gif is the 
file name of the image, in this case a GIF file. The img part says 
‘place image here’, and src tells the browser that the source is 
an image in the same directory as the text file called picture.
gif. Better practice is to be more organized and put all the 
images in their own subfolder named ‘images’, in which case the 
tag would be <img src="images/picture.gif">. When 
you come to FTP your files to a host server, you must ensure 
that the file hierarchy is exactly the same as it is on your hard 
drive otherwise the web page will not be able to find the images. 
As an image tag does not have an end tag (just like a line 
break), strictly it should be written <img src="images/
picture.gif" />. But we’ll keep it simple for now. It is also 
useful to specify the dimensions of the image, in pixels, using 
<width> and <height> attributes, having checked its 
dimensions, and resized if necessary, in Photoshop. If you do 
this, the browser will leave a space for the image and display 
any text that follows without waiting for the image to load. The 
<alt> attribute allows you to describe the image in words 
(a text alternative) and is a courtesy to users with a browser 
that does not support graphics and to visually disabled people 
who rely on their computer to speak the websites out loud. This 
text description will appear if an image cannot be loaded, and 
often appears if a mouse is rolled over the image.
Other attributes define if an image has a border. For instance, 
when you use an image as a link, the default is a blue rectangular 
border. This can look odd, particularly on images with an irregular 
outline, so set the border to 0. For example:
<img src="images/littlehampton2.jpg" width="600" height="412" 
border="0" alt="East Beach Cafe" />
displays an image without a border. If you were using a browser 
such as Lynx, or had images switched off, all you would see 
would be the text ‘East Beach Cafe’. We can also add a caption, 
so the code for our new, improved home page looks like this:
<html>
<head>
<title>Jane Doe Photographer</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="images/littlehampton2.jpg" width="600" height="412"

Publicizing your pages
How do you tell the world that you have a website? You can 
send out postcards, and add your URL to your letterheads and 
to the signature on your email and newsgroup postings. And 
you can make it easy for people searching for your site to find it!
Search engines, such as Google, use various criteria to 
categorize websites; you can have some influence by using 
<meta> tags within the <head> section of your page, thus:
<meta name="description"
content="Jane Doe is a freelance photographer specializing in 
abstracted landscapes and architecture">
<meta name="keywords"
content="photography, photographer, landscape, abstract, 
architecture, architectural">
This will result in a ‘hit’ if you type in either ‘architecture’ 	
or ‘architectural’. As search engine robots have become more 
sophisticated, there is less reliance on such keywords, especially 
if they are repeated in the main body text.
SEO (search engine optimization) can increase the ranking 
of your web page in the search results. It is not an exact 
science, but factors that can help your hit rate include adding 
keywords and phrases subtly to the text on your home page, 
2.3 This simple web page uses all the 
defaults of the Safari browser: white 
background and blue hyperlinks, except 
that the default font Times has been 
changed to Verdana for clarity. The 
website was completely coded by hand 
using a text editor
cross-linking pages within the site, and getting friends and 
colleagues to link to your site – you can even link to your site 
from your own blog. Tweeting about your updates on Twitter 
can also drive traffic to your site and make it look popular.
When choosing keywords, try to think like a potential client 
searching for someone like you. Anyone putting ‘photographer’ 
in Google will be given thousands of choices, and it’s unlikely 
you’ll be top of the list! Someone, however, may be looking for 
a local photographer, so include your home town in the 
keywords to narrow down the list. And add all your specialities, 
but not too many or it won’t ring true. If they are looking for 
you in particular, and you have an uncommon name, then they 
will find you quickly. With a more common name, however, 
you’ll have more work to do. Weave the keywords into some 
meaningful text on your home page – simply including a long 
list of keywords won’t fool the search engine robots.
Another good way to publicize your blog or website is to 
participate in online forums or inspiration sites. If you are an 
illustrator, for example, Illustration Friday (illustrationfriday.com) 
sets a topic each week for you to tackle when you have a quiet 
moment. It gets your work seen by your peers (and perhaps  
by a potential client) and offers an opportunity to add a link to 
your site that will help in SEO. For web designers, there is 
Cargo (Fig 2.4), cargocollective.com, and there are similar sites

for photographers – some are text based, others give you an 
opportunity to upload work. Flickr groups also have discussion 
sections and most professional organizations will have a forum 
for members, and sometimes even non-members, to chat in 
about common concerns. The more you actively contribute to 
discussions on forums and mailing lists, the more exposure your 
work – and your website address – will receive.
Testing your pages
Web pages are cheap and fast to produce and the temptation 
is to publish as soon as you possibly can. After all, if there are 
mistakes, they can soon be rectified and the original files at the 
server overwritten. Nonetheless, it is still good practice to test, 
test, and then test again.
You can view your emerging pages on a browser such 	
as Firefox without going online, and this should be the first 
step. Then try viewing your pages on another browser, such 	
as Internet Explorer. Try uploading your pages to a home page 
site and go online to check that they still look okay and that 
everything works.
If you designed the pages on a Mac, find a friend with a 
PC and see how they look on that platform, and vice versa. A 
PC might have a 96dpi monitor, so your text will appear larger 
and your 72dpi graphic will appear smaller.

on your hard drive, which are then uploaded to the remote 
web server using its built-in FTP or an external FTP program.
Creating a site in Dreamweaver
Let’s go back to Jane Doe’s CV. First we simply copy and paste 
the text of the CV into the lower part of the split Dreamweaver 
window (Fig 2.7). Immediately, the code in the upper part of 
the window is updated, with paragraph and line-break tags 
automatically inserted – they are coloured blue to distinguish 
them from our (black) text. You will also note that Dreamweaver 
has inserted various DOCTYPE header tags at the top to indicate 
that this is strict XHMTL. I have saved this file as index.html 
and told Dreamweaver where to put it. As in the previous 
example it is important to have the hierarchy and structure of 
the folders mirror the website, as it will be on the server.
Dreamweaver can help you with the hierarchy of your site, 
but you first have to tell it where your root folder is. The root 
folder is the main folder of a website that contains the home 
page index.html. There is no reason why images, for example, 
could not also be placed in the root folder but it is more 
organized to have them in their own subfolder within the root 
folder. It is best practice to create the necessary folders and 
subfolders, then size your images and place them in the 
correct folder, before you open Dreamweaver and begin on 
your site. By contrast, programs such as Freeway (see page 
40) will happily assemble its own set of folders and files from 
resources that may be scattered all about your hard drive.
To make the email link work, highlight the email address 
and choose Insert>Email link from the top menu. A box will 
appear in which to paste the address (Fig 2.8). To make certain 
words bold or italic, highlight the text using the mouse and 
press the B or I buttons in the bottom Properties window, just 
like you do in your favourite word processor. Note that in the 
code Dreamweaver uses the logical style tags <strong> and 
<em> by default. To add an h1 heading, paste in the text, 
highlight it and choose Heading 1 in the Format pull-down 
menu (Fig 2.9).
To insert the photograph, make sure it has been sized in 
Photoshop (resampled to 72dpi and to a width of 600px) and 	
a copy placed in the images folder inside the website folder. 
Place the cursor where you want to position the image on the 
page, i.e. between the heading and the first paragraph, and 
choose Insert>Image from the top menu. You will be presented 
with a box with which to navigate to the image’s location. Add 
the alternative text describing the image in the Image Tag  
Open-source software
The big drawback with commercial proprietary programs (such 
as Dreamweaver and Freeway, discussed below) is that you 
have to buy them, although if you are a student there will be 
educational discounts available. Note that what you are buying 
is a licence to use the product – you never actually own it! An 
alternative is to use open-source or public-domain software, 
which is generally available free of charge. Other inexpensive 
programs may be ‘shareware’, and will be available for a 
donation or nominal fee. The best example of open source is 
the WWW itself, which Tim Berners-Lee gave to the world.
Every proprietary program has its open-source equivalents: 
Microsoft Word has LibreOffice; Adobe Photoshop has Aviary 
and The Gimp; and Dreamweaver has Nvu and KompoZer. Many 
are specific to the platform, but these examples are available 
for Windows, Linux and Mac computers. Open source means 
that the source code of the software is accessible to change or 
improve should you wish, with the approval of the community 
that is developing the program collaboratively. Open-source 
programs are licensed just like proprietary programs, granting 
you the right to copy, modify and redistribute source code (or 
content), but possibly also imposing obligations. Of course, 
most users won’t want to develop the program, just use it, and 
they can be a viable option, but most will lack many of the 
features of the proprietary programs, and will have limited 
documentation and technical support.
Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver is most probably the first program one thinks of 
for designing websites. Introduced by Macromedia in 1997 for 
the Mac, with a Windows version launched in 1998, it was 
acquired by Adobe in 2005, and in 2007 replaced Adobe’s own 
product, GoLive, in their Creative Suite CS3. Just as Photoshop 
dominates image-processing applications, Dreamweaver now 
has a near monopoly on web design. Dreamweaver is described 
as a hybrid wysiwyg (‘what you see is what you get’) and 
code-based web design and development application. The 
window in which you place such elements as text and images 
looks much like a browser window, but it is possible to toggle 
to the HTML code, or have both aspects of the design – code 
and appearance – visible and updateable at the same time (Fig 
2.6). It uses syntax highlighting to display the code in different 
colours so that text is easily distinguished from the code. Like 
other HTML helpers, Dreamweaver is used to edit files locally 
Helper 
applications

Code
Accessibility Attributes box and press OK. The image should 
now appear, with size and alt text incorporated automatically. 
Set the border to 0 in the bottom window (Fig 2.10) if desired. 
All that remains is to add the link at the end of the CV. 
Highlight the text and type or paste in the URL of the website 
into the Link box in the bottom Properties window. Finally, set 
the Target to _blank so that the link will open in a new 
window (Fig 2.11). The completed CV page can be previewed 
in a browser, such as Safari, to check all is well (Fig 2.12), 
before being uploaded to the server by FTP and published on 
to the internet for the world to see. 
As with most programs, there are many different ways of 
carrying out a particular action, including keyboard shortcuts 
for ‘power users’. You will also note that we have only scraped 
the surface of Dreamweaver’s functionality.
Of course, you can hide the code completely and just work 
in wysiwyg mode, but being able to access the code means 
that you can identify and sort out any problems at a glance. Try 
editing the code, press the Refresh button and see how the 
wysiwyg window has changed. As in the previous hand-crafted 
example, we have done no text formatting other than to make 
a few words bold or italic: we have relied completely on the 
defaults of the browser. In the next chapter we will learn how 
to change the layout and typography using CSS (Cascading 
Style Sheets).

have it already in a particular folder. So, import the image and 
using the contextual menu (ctrl-click on the Mac), choose Fit 
Box to Content – because we have already sized our image 
(Fig 2.18). Alt text can be added via the Page menu. The title 
‘About me’ is added in the Inspector, and any meta tags can 
be incorporated using the pop-up form found at Page>Meta 
Tags. Finally, we add the link to the Flickr site using the same 
method used for the email link: by choosing Edit>Hyperlink  
(Fig 2.19). The various text and graphic boxes have here been 
quickly aligned by eye and using guides that can be dragged 
from the side rulers; to use Freeway properly, the alignment 
and positioning should ideally be according to a predetermined 
layout. We can now preview the page in Safari (other browsers 
are available) to check all is well (Fig 2.20) before publishing 	
the site via the File menu. The published ‘site’ can now be 
uploaded to your server using Freeway’s built-in FTP or an 
external FTP program, such as Transmit. 
Although Freeway keeps you well insulated from the code, 
we can take a peek at it using another helper program, which 
we will encounter in the next section, PageSpinner (Fig 2.21). 
You will notice that it is considerably more complex than in earlier 
examples and has introduced CSS elements almost against 
our will – all that material in the head and tags such as <span 
class="style1"> in the body. This is no bad thing, so long 
as the code complies with standards. Quite sophisticated 
websites, incorporating JavaScript actions (see Chapter 6), 
can be created quickly using Freeway, and if you really don’t 
want to know, you need never see the code that makes them 
work (Figs 2.22 and 2.23).
Freeway
Freeway, from Softpress, is a Mac-only wysiwyg program that 
does not allow you to see the code at all. It claims to operate 
just like a desktop publishing application, such as InDesign or 
QuarkXPress, and – unlike many other wysiwyg web design 
applications – to produce syntactically valid code conforming 
to W3C standards, thus making it usable for websites where 
valid HTML code is obligatory. 
Once more, let’s begin by pasting in our text into a blank 
page (Fig 2.15). First, create a text box using the HTML button 
above the window, as you would in QuarkXPress, and import 
or paste in the text we used in previous examples. It is actually 
quite difficult to design for browser defaults using Freeway, as 
it immediately asks you what colours and fonts you would like 
to use. Normally, using browser defaults, the page will be as 
wide and deep as the content dictates. Freeway, however, 
requires the page size to be specified. 
Long pages, although often seen in blogs, are generally 
discouraged in web circles and should be split into many 
smaller ones, with links between them. The point at which the 
text meets the bottom of the browser window is termed the 
fold: anything below the fold requires scrolling using the 
sidebars of the window. If you do decide to put all the content 
on a long page rather than several shorter ones, ensure that 
the important information – and the navigation – is always 
above the fold and hence instantly available. For this exercise, 
all the content was contained in one page.
When we go to File>Preview in Browser, all the text 
appears above the fold, although the spacing needs adjusting 
(Fig 2.16). The text can be tidied up using the Delete button 
and by introducing line breaks using Insert>New line in the top 
menu, or the keyboard shortcut Shift-Return. To make words 
bold or italic, highlight the words using the mouse and click the 
B or I buttons on the Inspector palette, top right. To activate 
the email link, highlight the address, and select Edit>Hyperlink 
from the top menu, choose External, mailto: from the drop-
down menu and paste in the address (Fig 2.17).
To fit in the photo, we will first make the page bigger by 
putting W: 700px and H: 1200px in the Inspector and moving 
the text box down the page. First, however, we will create 
another text box for our heading. Now, we are unable to use 
an h1 heading unless we go into CSS, and we don’t want to 
do that yet, so we will merely make it bold. Use the Graphic

Code
2.15 Freeway acts in a similar way to 
InDesign or QuarkXPress – it is completely 
wysiwyg, using text and image boxes – 
and no code to be seen 
2.16 A Safari preview of the Freeway 
document reveals that the formatting of 
the text needs some tweaking. Green 
guidelines dragged from the side rulers 
allow you to align boxes and images,

Chapter 2
where the link and target can be entered. Don’t forget to add 
paragraph and line breaks: highlight the whole paragraph and 
hit the ‘paragraph’ ¶ button to add <p> tags, and place the 
cursor where you want line breaks and hit the ‘bent arrow’ 
button. Line breaks are not necessary for headings, but the 
bold subheads do require them. To add the image, place the 
cursor under the h1 heading and hit the ‘picture frame’ button. 
Navigate to the image (it should already be in an images 
subfolder in your root folder) and add an alt tag in the HTML 
Assistant (Fig 2.26). The page can now be previewed by 
pressing the ‘eye’ button at the bottom left of the window or  
in the browser of your choice via the ‘M’ button at the top  
(Fig 2.27). And that’s it: nice clean code and a simple website 
painlessly created (almost) by hand.
There are many ways to design a profile: this has been the 
most stripped-down, basic example, getting you used to 
different helper programs. In the next chapter we will at last 
start to do some actual designing, when we put CSS to work 
for graphic design-style typography and layout.
PageSpinner
The final helper application we will look at in this chapter takes 
us back to basics and hand-crafted code, albeit with some 
automated assistance. PageSpinner, from Optima System, 
belongs to a class of HTML programs that includes BBEdit made 
by Bare Bones Software and WebDesign from Rage Software 
– basically text editors with added features aimed at helping to 
write HTML, such as syntax highlighting and actions that make 
adding and formatting tags much easier than manually typing 
them out. A new page from PageSpinner already includes the 
most fundamental tags, along with a DOCTYPE. 
So once again, lets paste our CV text between the <body> 
tags and the title between the <title> tags (Fig 2.24). To 
make words bold and italic we highlight the text and press the 
B or I buttons on the top menu. In Preferences we can choose 
whether these actions produce logical <strong> or physical 
<b> styles. To create an h1 and h2 heading, we again highlight 
the text and choose Header 1 or Header 2 from the Size 
menu. To make the email a link, highlight the text and enter the 
email address into the HTML Assistant window. There is also 
an HTML Examples window available for guidance (Fig 2.25).
To add the Flickr link, again highlight the text and hit the 
‘chains’ button at the top – this will pop up the HTML Assistant 
2.24 Text editor PageSpinner uses 	
syntax highlighting to allocate different 
colours to different tags, thus making 
troubleshooting easier

Chapter 2
Step-by-step 1
Instant websites: a customized blog
Step 1.
Register with WordPress. Other blogging 
platforms include Blogger, LiveJournal, 
Posterous, Tumblr and TypePad, but for  
this exercise log on at wordpress.com 
(wordpress.org is the address of the original 
self-hosted version) and fill in the registration 
form. The username of janedoephotography 
was available so a blog (right) is 
automatically created with that name  
(it can be changed later). The URL of your 
blog is http://janedoephotography.
wordpress.com/ – later you can always 
register your own domain and either simply 
redirect it to the blog or ‘map’ your domain 
so that your blog’s address would be 
janedoephotography.com without the  
.wordpress.com portion.
Step 2.
WordPress automatically puts a dummy 
posting, complete with a comment, on your 
blog that you can either delete or edit 
(above). Editing it will give you a taste of 
how to add content to your blog, so here 
we will replace the text. You can type 
directly into the top box, or prepare your 
text in a word processor and copy it in 
(right). To make a word italic, for example, 
highlight it and press the I button above the 
box. To create a link to another website, 
highlight the words you would like to work 
as the link, hit the ‘chain’ button and paste 
in the full URL, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Angus_McBean. Two other important 
things to do now are to set the category 
and tags. The category you select will 
become your menu item, e.g. landscapes, 
still lifes, portraits. Each posting will have 
just one category. Tags further describe the 
posting, so you can have more than one 
per posting.

Hi, my name is Jane Doe and I'm a photographer. I graduated from Brighton University's Editorial Photography department in 2009 and have since been commissioned to create the cover of Italian
Vogue and I've also produced a calendar of my landscapes for a leading charity. My influences include Angus McBean, Julia Margaret Cameron and Richard Avenon . I'm a big fan of Flickr and
FaceBook and you can find my complete resumé and contact details on the About page. Here is a landscaoe I took at dusk from Seaford Head showing the famous white cliffs of the Seven Sisters in
Sussex.

Code
The other advantages of a hosted blog are:
• they are free
• you don’t need to worry about hosting or FTP
• you don’t need to learn any HTML
• you don’t need to buy and learn to use any software
• people can comment on your postings
Here we shall set up a blog for Jane Doe, an imaginary 
photographer.
A blog (short for weblog) is fundamentally a kind of diary or 
journal, with the entries, or postings, appearing with the most 
recent first, at the top of the page. Previous postings are 
archived automatically and tidied away. The great thing about 
blogs is that they can be customized so that their appearance 
looks less like what you might think a blog looks like and more 
like a conventional website. With a little imagination, you can 
even create a portfolio website quickly and painlessly. For an 
instant web presence, blogs take a lot of beating. 
Step 3.
To add an image, click the ‘picture frame’ 
button above the box you were just typing 
into and find the image on your hard drive  
(it is best to prepare your images first in 
Photoshop or another image-processing 
program to be 72dpi and not more than 
550 pixels wide). WordPress will resize 
them to 450 pixels wide. Add any caption 
information in the form and click the Insert 
into Post button. Press the blue Upload 
Post button on the right and take a look at 
the first proper posting on your site (right).
Step 4.
Now to change its appearance with some 
customization. The default look and feel for 
WordPress is a template called Kubrick by 
Michael Heilemann. There are many other 
templates to choose from, but let’s stick 
with this for now. Return to My Dashboard 
and click the Appearance button on the left 
menu. The simplest way to change the 
appearance of your blog is to change the 
header. Click Custom Header and you will 
find you can either simply change the colour 
from blue, or replace it completely with a 
banner of your own. Now you can be 
creative and create an image 740 x 192px 
to fill the space. I’m sure you can do better 
than my attempt. Import it and click the 
Hide text button. I have also added a second 
posting and category (right).

JANE DOE PHOTOGRAPHY
Just another WordPress.com weblog
Jane Doe's Blog
My Account  ▼        My Dashboard     New Pos

Chapter 2
Step 5.
Next we will tidy up the navigation. Back at 
My Dashboard, under Appearance, is a menu 
item called Widgets (right), where the items 
on the right-hand side of this template can be 
edited. I have changed Blogroll to Links and 
Categories to Menu. Note that when you click 
on a Menu (Category) item a page will be 
created on the fly containing all the postings 
defined by that category – here, all 
landscapes. The menu will grow as you add 
new categories. Tags are arranged in a 
‘cloud’, the largest words denoting the most 
popular tags, with the most recent ones 
listed first. External links can be added by 
clicking the Links button upper left of the 
control panel. Another feature of WordPress 
is that at the bottom of the page is a link to 
an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed, so 
followers can keep track of when your blog 
has been updated. In WordPress you can 
create standalone pages too, for a CV or 
résumé, contact details and perhaps an 
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).
Step 6.
So, without spending a penny or using  		
a single line of HTML, you have created 		
a credible web presence, which will be 
instantly publicized throughout the blogging 
community (right). You can add its URL 
to your email signature and begin to make 
it known in many other ways, before 
eventually search engines like Google will 
find and list it. 
Example.
Artist and maker Lesley Buckingham 
writes and illustrates fairy books under the 
name of Betty Bib (right). She set up a 
customized blog – Betty Bib’s Fairyware 
(http://bettybib.blogspot.com/) using 
Blogger, to communicate and interact with 
her fans around the world. She also uses 	
it to promote her books, greetings cards 
and handmade fairies, with links to Amazon 
and her Etsy online shop.

Chapter 2
Trailblazer 1
Joshua Davis
Joshua Davis was an early adopter of Adobe (formerly 
Macromedia) Flash, the author of Flash to the Core (2002) and 
was featured in the seminal book New Masters of Flash (2000). 
He moved from Colorado to New York in 1992, and it was at 
the Pratt Institute in 1995, while studying illustration and painting, 
that Davis began writing HTML. Soon he was also experimenting 
with Flash. From 1998 to 2001 he worked with the web 
production company Kioken Design, where he created the 
website for Barneys in New York (Fig 1).
In 2002 he joined up with developer Branden Hall to form 
The Department of Notation Studios, a media development 
studio, disbanded in 2006 when Hall left to form Automata 
Studios Ltd in Washington D.C. With Hall, Davis developed a 
coding framework called Hype, designed to make Flash – and 
ActionScript – fun, allowing beginners to express themselves 
playfully while learning how to program. His big break came in 
2003 when he was asked by Adam Jones of rock band Tool 	
to redesign their website.
Since 2007, Davis has lived and worked in New York. He 
is a professor at New York’s School of Visual Arts, runs his own 
design studio, and continues to lecture and lead workshops at 
design conferences around the world.
Davis was influenced by abstract expressionist painter 
Jackson Pollock, not so much for his visual style but the way 
he was disconnected from the process: ‘he always identified 
himself as a painter, even though a lot of the time his brush 
never hit the canvas’. Davis writes code that randomly distributes, 
arranges and distorts his artwork, to generate new work. It’s 	
a process he calls ‘Dynamic Abstraction’, and can be seen on 
his experimental gallery Once Upon a Forest, in his ‘stained 
glass’ artwork, on his iPhone app Reflect and on his diverse 
merchandise, which includes cups and saucers, bags for 
stationery company Miquelrius and bedding for homeware 
designers Umbra.
Lately, Davis has become a fan of WordPress (Fig 2), 
saying that WordPress plug-ins have taken the place of complex 
Flash snippets to bring interactivity and a network-based 
experience to web design. ‘I can install WordPress in  
11 minutes‚ and right out of the box I have access to thousands 
of plug-ins that can be modified to suit your visual needs, and 
a level of social-networking functionality that we all expect to 
have on a site. Try the same thing in Flash – it won’t just take 
11 minutes. And it might even be longer than 11 days.’
‘In terms of layout, I’m always looking for the most efficient 
way to present content, so that the work is the object that 
shines and the layout is a quiet vehicle to deliver the content. 
WordPress has a community of people creating features that 
make it easier for a guy like me to update easily, while at home 
or on the road, from my phone. I can upgrade WordPress and 
you would have no idea it had happened. I can tear down my 
current theme and create a new one‚ and the content sitting 	
in my database wouldn’t care less. This project exists as a 
singular entity and is able to adapt to the changing displays in 
which it’s viewed.’
He’s created websites for clients such as Motorola, Sony, 
Nokia and Volkswagen, he was the winner of the 2001 Prix 
Ars Electronica Golden Nica in the category ‘Net Excellence’ 
and has exhibited at Ars Electronica in Austria, Tate Modern, 
the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Design Museum in 
London, Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, P.S.1 Contemporary 
Art Center, MoMA and the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt, 
National Design Museum, both in New York.

Figs 5 – 11 The experimental website 
Once Upon A Forest is explained in a 
comment in its code, which can be seen by 
choosing View Source from your browser’s 
menu. He writes: ‘For me, the art form is 
not in the few days it takes me to write the 
program. The art is the few weeks I will 
spend living with the work, waiting for  
the work to evolve. Running functions, 
re-running functions, always waiting 	
	
to capture that moment in time – the 
beautiful accident.’

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  "Dynamic Abstraction"
  Among modern artists I conceptually identify with Jackson Pollock - not
  that I'm a particular fan of his visual style, but because he always
  identif ied himself as a painter, even though a lot of the time his brush
  never hit the canvas.  There's something in that disconnect - not using a
  brush of tool in traditional methods - that says a lot about the concept
  of dynamic abstraction, because in that loss of control there can be
  beauty in randomness.
  Pollock might argue that it's the process of abstraction that's dynamic,
  not the end result, which in his case is a static painting.  In my own
  work, the end result is never static; by making room for as many
  anomalies as possible, every composition generated by the programs I
  write is unique to itself.  I program the "brushes," the "paints," the
  "strokes," the rules and the boundaries.  However it is the machine that
  creates the compositions - the programs draw themselves.  I am in a 
  constant state of surprise and discovery, because the program may
  structure compositions that I may never have thought of to execute or
  might take me hours to create manually.
  For me, the art form is not in the few days it takes me to write the 
  program.  The art is the few weeks I will spend living with the work,
  waiting for the work to evolve.  Running functions, re-running functions,
  always waiting to capture that moment in time - the beautiful accident,
  "Residue"
  I've often wondered how work inf luences the next project. How colors and
  forms make their way into future works - building on this idea of
  "f low", or continuation of style and process.
  The body of work on this site is navigated in a linear format, starting
  with the most current composition and then offering the ability to
  navigate backwards to a prior composition. However, as you navigate, an
  imprint of prior work is left - giving us the ability to see how new
  works played upon prior compositions.
  The system has the ability to store 5 projects at a time, slowly fading
  out prior projects as you press forward. If you were on the 5th
  composition the system would look like this...
  20 % transparent - composition 1
  40 % transparent - composition 2
  60 % transparent - cimposition 3
  80 % transparent - composition 4
  100 % transparent - composition 5 - current position
  Upon pressing forward to the 6th composition, the system would look like
  this...
  removed - composition 1
 
  20 % transparent - composition 2
  40 % transparent - composition 3
  60 % transparent - composition 4
  80 % transparent - composition 5
  100 % transparent - composition 6 - current position.
  The challenge... is for me to try to build work that somehow f lows or
  plays on what was previously created. How will new themes play with
  related or conf licting new themes? How will space be used? How will color
  be introduced and evolved? How will possible collaboration with other
  artists and designers f it into the system without stepping outside of the
  f low?

With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), designers at last have a sound, 
simple method for producing layouts that will be both standards-compliant 
and accessible to all. If you already know some HTML, then you can 
forget many of the tags you may have been using, but you will have to 
learn about two new ones: <div> and <span>, of which more later. 
Until recently, designers had few options when it came to laying out web 
pages. They had to use either framesets or tables – using spacers 
(transparent single-pixel GIF images resized to a specified width and 
height) to attempt any form of controllable layout. Both methods are 
unsatisfactory for various reasons, as will be described in this chapter, 
and have been replaced by CSS.

Cinematek is a permanent exhibition 
space for the Royal Film Archive’s 
collections. The design and art direction 
for their website is by BaseDesign, with 
development by Tentwelve, both Brussels-
based. It uses CSS with some JavaScript 
to produce a clear but visually engaging 
user experience

Chapter 3
Using tables
A table is a grid of rows and columns, rather like a spreadsheet. 
Designers produce layouts by filling some cells with content, 
with other, empty cells acting as spacers – except they have to 
contain something or else they will collapse. This is where the 
‘invisible’ transparent GIF comes in. Images can be expanded 
or contracted to any rectangular shape or size by means of 	
the height and width attributes. For file-space-saving reasons 	
a 1px clear GIF is used, resized to the amount of blank space 
required in the layout. David Siegel is credited as being the 
inventor of the spacer GIF in his 1996 book Creating Killer Web 
Sites. The code:
<img src="images/dot_clear.gif" width="8" height="8">
would thus produce a space 8px by 8px. Because the GIF is 
transparent, the cell can be given a background colour that will 
show through.
A table layout takes the form:
<table>
<tr> <!-- row 1 -->
	
<td>item</td>
	
<td>another item</td>
</tr>
<tr>  <!-- row 2 -->
	
<td>a third item</td>
	
<td><img src="images/dot_clear.gif" width="8"      
     height="8"></td>
</tr>
</table>
The tag <tr> indicates the row, <td> the cell. The 
<table> tag can have several attributes:
<table border="1" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="3"  
summary="description of the table">
Most of these are now invalid in strict XHTML and have 
been replaced by CSS. Tables can be nested in other tables to 
produce quite complex layouts, and until recently this was how 
such programs as Dreamweaver generated layouts. It worked 
– but was very cumbersome to code.
The only way to publish exact layouts on the web is to link 
to a PDF (Portable Document Format) file, a slow, unsatisfactory 
method, requiring users to install plug-ins or to download and 
view in a PDF reader (some browsers allow you to view PDFs in 
HTML, but do a poor job; and it defeats the object anyway). 
Frames 
and tables
Using framesets
A frameset divides a web page into different segments, each 
frame containing and displaying a separate HTML document. 
Repeating parts of a layout, such as the navigation, can appear 
in one frame, while variable content is displayed in another. 
Headers and sidebar menus remain in fixed positions if the 
content frame is scrolled up and down. This can be very 
convenient – to add an item to the sidebar menu, for example, 
you need only update one file, whereas on a non-frameset 
website each individual page would have to be edited (Fig 3.2).
However, SSI (Server Side Includes) and scripting languages 
such as PHP can also be used to accomplish this aim 	
without the disadvantages of frames (more on SSI and PHP 	
in Chapter 6).
The <frame> tags replace the <body> tags thus:
<frameset cols="85%, 15%">
  <frame src="url of page 1">
  <frame src="url of page 2">
  <noframes>
    Text displayed in browsers that do not support frames.
  </noframes>
</frameset>
The <noframes> tag is a courtesy to users with browsers 
that do not recognize framesets.
There are several big drawbacks to framesets. They can 
break the link between the content and its URL, making it 
difficult for other sites to link to particular pages or bookmark  
a particular frame of content. Visitors arriving at your site from 
search engines may open an ‘incomplete’ page intended for 
display within a frame and hence with no apparent navigation 
to allow you to move elsewhere in the site. Framesets do not 
usually print the way users expect, and clicking an external link 
on a frames-based page could result in someone else’s pages 
appearing within your frameset ad infinitum. Finally, if the screen 
resolution or browser window size is too small, then each 
frame will develop scroll bars, making the page look cluttered 
and messy. So although frames were included in the XHTML 
1.0 specification, they did not make it through to XHTML 1.1.
3.2 It’s not immediately obvious that 
London-based illustrator Richard  
Sanderson’s website relied on frames to 
make the top title and menu appear on 
every page. Look at the toolbar, however, 
and you'll notice that the URL never 
changes, making bookmarking a particular 
page impossible. It has since been 
converted to CSS (below)

Layout
CSS (Cascading 
Style Sheets)
referenced inside a single HTML document. And a single CSS 
document can be shared by many HTML pages. All the styles 
will ‘cascade’ into a new ‘virtual’ style sheet, in order of priority:
1 an inline style inside an HTML element;
2 an internal style sheet contained within the <head> tag;
3 an external style sheet;
4 the browser default.
Thus an inline style, such as
<p style="color: #009900; margin-left: 20px">
This is a green indented paragraph.
</p>
for a paragraph with a different colour and left margin from the 
rest, will override a style declared inside the <head> tag, which 
in turn will override an external style sheet. If the CSS should 
fail completely, your website will degrade gracefully – that means 
you will still have a legible document, but displayed using the 
browser’s default styles (usually Times on a white background, 
with blue underlined links). 
An external style sheet is merely a text file with the suffix 	
.css, for example style.css. The instructions in a style sheet 
are called statements, or rules, and have two parts: a selector 
(an HTML tag), and a declaration enclosed by curly brackets { }. 
The selector tells a browser which elements in a page will be 
affected by the rule; the declaration tells the browser which set 
of properties to apply (Fig 3.4). 
selector {property: value;}
CSS has been used for years to style fonts and colours. Before 
CSS, to assign typographic characteristics to, say, all <h1> 
headings, designers had to use the <font> tag to mark up 
each occurrence of that heading type, making document code 
complex and difficult to maintain, and increasing file size. Fewer 
HTML tags in a document reduces page download times and 
bandwidth. The only drawback to CSS at present is in uneven 
browser support, so hacks or workarounds sometimes have 	
to be introduced to cater for older versions of browsers such 	
as Internet Explorer. In 2006, the W3C (World Wide Web 
Consortium) declared CSS to be superior to previous methods. 
The <font> tag is now ‘deprecated’, which means that it is 
tolerated in older websites, but it is to be avoided in new-builds. 
In CSS, presentation is separated from structure, such 
that a single standalone CSS document can define colour, 
font, text alignment, size and many other attributes. Change 
the CSS document and every page attached to it is automatically 
updated. But it can do much more, and designers are now 
using CSS for layout, with <div> (for ‘division’) tags to position 
‘containers’ of design elements. Localized design changes are 
handled by a <span> tag, like the span of a bridge.
CSS separates design from structure and content. The 
content and structure is in the HTML (or strictly speaking XHTML) 
documents; the design is in the CSS file (Fig 3.5). So-called 
‘tableless’ web design also improves accessibility: screen 
readers and voice software have fewer problems with CSS 
designs because the content follows a more logical structure. 	
It is also possible to provide multiple layouts for different devices, 
such as netbooks (small, light and cheap laptops, often with 
touch-screen interaction) and mobile phones, by having a 
dedicated CSS file for each.
Why ‘cascading’? Styles can be specified inside a single 
HTML element, inside the <head> element of an HTML page, 
or in an external CSS file. Multiple external style sheets can be 
3.3 The Grid System is a website by New 
York designer Antonio Carusone that 
collects resources on the layout method 
made popular by the Swiss International 
Typographic Style movement in the mid-
20th century. The XHTML/CSS site can 
be seen with and without the underlying 
grid structure
3.4 A style, or rule, contains two parts: 
a selector, which tells the browser to 
style an h1 heading in this case, and 
a declaration, which in turn contains 
properties and their values

Chapter 3
3.5 Zen Garden is a demonstration project by Dave Shea that shows how identical content 
can look very different when styled by different designers – the HTML code remains exactly 
the same, the only thing that changes is the external CSS file 
to avoid using <bold> for subheads, even though it may look 
identical to an <h2>; an <h2> heading can have its own 
individual styling in the CSS. Even if they are not as attractive, 
such websites should elegantly degrade, if the CSS should 
somehow fail, and should continue to make sense in various 
generations of browsers.
The external style sheet, style.css, is associated with 
the HTML page by adding a link in the <head> section. There 
are different ways to do this. The most common is to add:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
More complicated style sheets – multiple style sheets for 
different languages or different versions for printing, for example 
– can be called in using the @import statement:
<style type="text/css">@import url("style.css");</style>
The most common use of @import instead (or along with) 
<link> is because older browsers don’t recognize @import, 
so you could use it to hide styles from them.
One drawback to using @import is that if you have a very 
simple <head> with just the @import rule in it, your pages 
may display a flash of unstyled content as it is loading. This can 
be jarring to your viewers.
A statement with a selector for the <h1> heading, for example, 
with multiple properties, might look like this:
h1 {
 font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
 font-size: 36px;
 text-align: center; 
 color: #333333;
 font-weight: bold;
}
Properties are separated by semi-colons; the final one is 
optional but worth putting in, in case you want to add any 
other attributes in future. Size can be measured in px (pixels), 
as here, or in points, ems (equal to the current font size), exs 
(the x-height of a font), picas, inches or millimetres (see 
Chapter 4). Colours are generally defined in hexadecimal RGB. 
Doubled-up numbers such as 00FF55 can be abbreviated to 
three figures, 0F5. W3C also has 16 colour keywords that will 
validate: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, grey, green, lime, maroon, 
navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white and yellow. 
Similarly, all other HTML tags can be styled. The syntax 	
is very precise, but there are programs available, such as 	
Style Master and CSSEdit, with every possible permutation 	
of properties, accessed by pull-down menus, to take care of 
writing the code for you. To style the body text, for example, 
the body tag <body> and the paragraph tag <p> will be given 
certain typographic properties. To create a minor variation of a 
tag, such as a caption to an image that you may want to look 
smaller than the body text, a class attribute is used. In the style 
sheet it will look like this:
p.caption {
 font-size: 10px;
}
In an HTML document, the <p> tag for the caption will be 
modified thus:
<p class="caption">This is a caption</p>
Other classes, not related to an HTML tag, just have a dot 
in front of their ID, for example .clearboth (see page 65). 
There will be more about typographical CSS in Chapter 4.
The important thing to remember is that the HTML document 
holds the content in some sort of logical structure. All paragraphs 
should be contained within <p> tags and headings should be 
identified hierarchically, with <h1> for the main heading, <h2> 
for a subheading, <h3> for a sub-subheading and so on. Try

Layout
The main building blocks used in CSS page layouts are <div> 
elements, or boxes, each with a unique ID so that we can 
identify them and give them positioning properties in the style 
sheet. A <div> tag has no inherent visual or structural 
properties, it is just an empty vessel waiting for you to give it 
meaning. A web page layout will typically comprise a header 	
or banner, the main content, a navigation bar or menu, either 
horizontally under the banner or vertically in the left column, 
perhaps a sidebar in the right-hand column, and a footer (Fig 
3.6). For a simple two <div> website with just a header and 
area for content, the HTML might look like this:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" 
lang="en">
<head>

 </div>
   
 <div id="content">
 <p>This is the main content area</p>
 </div>
  
</div>
</body>
</html>
Note the complicated-looking DOCTYPE declaration at the 
beginning, which states that this is a valid strict XHTML 1.0 
web page, and will thus validate at http://validator.w3.org/ and 
receive a seal of approval. A website does not necessarily have 
to validate for it to work, but being standards-compliant can 
avoid problems later and assist accessibility (see page 72). 
Note also the link to the external CSS document. The wrapper 
contains the whole page, constraining its width, and enables 
the website to be centred in the browser window, for example.
3.6 A schematic diagram of a typical web page, which will generally have a header 
containing a banner, sidebars for navigational menus and other standard matter, a central 
area for content (which may include nested <div>s), and perhaps a footer for copyright 
and contact information. This kind of layout is known as the ‘box model’
Margin
3.7 A CSS <div> box can have a border (solid, dotted or invisible), margins outside the 
box to keep it at a distance from other elements, and padding within the box to keep 
content away from the border. It can also have a fill colour or contain a background graphic

So, adding our content to the code results in:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en"

</div>
   
</body>
</html>
The part of the CSS code that defines the layout will look 
like this:
#wrapper { 
 margin: 0 auto;
 width: 922px;
}
#header {
 width: 900px;
 padding: 20px;
 border: 0px;
 height: 100px;
 margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;
 background: #cccccc;
}
#content { 
 width: 900px;
 border: 0px;
 background: #e6e6e6;
 margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;
 padding: 10px;
}
In CSS, the <div> IDs are always preceded by a hash 
mark, #. Note that the borders of the boxes here are measured 
in pixels, as are the margins (the space around the box) and 
padding (the space inside the border) (Fig 3.7).
	
Use a shortcut
	
Instead of writing out all four attributes of margins (and padding), viz:
	
#example-div {
	
 margin-top: 2px;
	
 margin-right: 3px;
	
 margin-bottom: 4px;
	
 margin-left: 5px; 
	
}
	
you can write them all in one line, remembering the clockwise order  	
	
in which the margins are defined: top, right, bottom, left.
	
#example-div { margin: 2px 3px 4px 5px; }
	
If all the margins are the same, you can write:
	
#div { margin: 5px; }

#content { 
 padding: 10px;
 border: 0px;
 margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;
 background: #e6e6e6;
}
To save having to repeat definitions, the selectors body 
and p have been grouped, using a comma. Don’t worry about 
the various properties for now, they will be explained in detail 
later. The finished page now looks a lot more interesting (Fig 3.8), 
and merely changing the CSS will change the whole appearance 
of the website, with the content staying the same. The CSS as 
seen in Style Master is shown in Fig 3.9. 
For links, this design still uses the browser defaults. We 
can go on to define link properties using what are known as 
‘pseudo-classes’. CSS pseudo-classes are used to add special 
effects to some selectors, thus:
Chapter 3
a:link {
}
a:visited {
}
a:hover {
}
a:active {
}
Hover, for example, changes the colour of the link or its 
background when the user’s mouse rolls over it (more in 
Chapter 4). These need to be in the specific order: link, visited, 
hover, active – or they may not work properly. 
	
LoVe? HA!
	
The four states of a link can be given different colours: the default is an 	
	
underlined blue (#0000FF) for the link, which turns red (#FF0000) when 	
	
clicked (a:active) and changes to purple (#800080) once visited. The 	
	
a:hover, which changes the colour as the mouse rolls over, is ignored. 	
	
All of these can be changed to your colour scheme using CSS, but these 	
	
states must be defined in the correct order: link, visited, hover and 	
	
active. A good way to remember it is to use the mnemonic ‘LoVe? HA!’.
The float property
We can use <div> tags to divide up a page into logical sections, 
but how do we put the blocks of content into position? The 
above example simply had one <div> below another, in what 
is known as normal flow – but now we want to position a menu 
column to the left of the content area and under the banner. 
There are three main kinds of layout: liquid (or fluid); 
fixed-width, or absolutely positioned; and elastic. A liquid layout 
is one where the sections and content will move to fill the 
browser window if it is enlarged or decreased in size; and elastic, 
where as the text size is increased, the sections, measured in 
ems, will increase in size as well. 
A fixed-width layout may sound as if it gives you more 
control, but it can annoy users with small screens, who will 
have to scroll up, down and side-to-side to view all the content, 
while those with large screens could see lots of wasted space. 
Most fixed-width sites will be 760px wide, aimed at users with 
800 x 600 screens. But as more people buy 1024 x 768 
monitors, 960px would be a better width to choose as it can 
be divided into halves, thirds and quarters. 
An elastic design is based on the font size of the end-user’s 
computer. If you size the divs in ems, then a short-sighted user 
increasing the font size will make all the page elements wider 

65
Layout
3.10 To create a two-column liquid design, float the sidebar either to the left (top) or right 
(bottom). The numbers indicate the order in which the chunks of html code should be written
as well, keeping everything in relative proportion (more in Chapter 
4). Remember that a user’s screen resolution will affect how 
much of your website they can see. On an older low-resolution 
screen, everything will appear larger, as each pixel will be bigger, 
but the user may have to scroll horizontally to see all the content. 
As more people have higher-resolution screens, this will not be 
such a problem.
If you float an element, it becomes a block box, which can 
be moved horizontally left or right, with other elements wrapping 
around. The markup values are float: left, float: right 
or float: none. An image, for example, can be pushed to the 
right, with text flowing around it, using the CSS:
img {
 float: right;
}
This general instruction would apply to all images, pushing 
them to the right. It would be better to create a specific class:
.thumbnail {
 float: left;
 width: 180px;
 margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;
}
Further thumbnails would float left until they push against 
their neighbour and there is no more room on the page, then 
they would start a new row. Applying a float left to a <div> 
creates a sidebar that could be used for the site’s menu, thus:
#leftcolumn { 
 width: 130px;
 float: left;
 }
Any elements following a floated element will wrap around 
it. To cancel this effect you can apply the clear property, 
which has four values: clear: left, clear: right, 
clear: both or clear: none. The CSS for a class called 
‘clearboth’ would be:
.clearboth { 
 clear: both; 
}
The HTML would look something like this:
<br class="clearboth" />
1 Wrapper
2 Header (banner)
3 Left
column
(navbar)
4 Content
(main)
Float left
5 Footer
1 Wrapper
2 Header (banner)
4 Content
(main)
5 Footer
3 Right
column
(sidebar)
Float right

66
If the sidebar floating left is given a specific width, the main 
content block flowing to the right of it will just expand to fill up 
the rest of the browser window, making this a liquid design. In 
the HTML, the code for the floated element must appear before 
the code for the element wrapping around it, even if the sidebar 
is floated right (Fig 3.10). Floats should always be given a width, 
either a fixed size in px or ems, or a percentage of the browser 
window width. Thus, if the sidebar is set at 20% and the browser 
window is 700px then the menu will be 140px wide. If the user 
expands the browser window to 1000px, the sidebar will also 
expand, to 200px wide, maintaining the overall proportions of 
the page. With a fixed-width wrapper, the layout will not change 
when the browser window changes size.
Unless you add a set height to the sidebar and the menu 
is quite short, it is possible that the main content could wrap 
underneath the sidebar, ruining the layout. To avoid this, add 	
a right float to the main content <div>. A three <div> basic 
layout would look like this (Fig 3.11):

3.13 The home website of Barcelona-
based graphic designers Hey Studios (see 
their blog on page 8) uses strict XHTML 
and JavaScript to produce a deceptively 
simple but effective portfolio site
3.14 Established in 2003, Brazilian 
design studio Nitrocorpz works in print, 
illustration, branding, animation and 
interactive projects. Their colourful 
grid-based website uses JavaScript 
and CSS to present their portfolio of 
projects in both English and Portuguese

Layout
Navigation
As discussed, in the simple box-model the menu is generally 
placed down the left column – the navbar. The menu of links to 
other pages is a form of navigation, the means by which your 
users will move around the site. Navigation is important so it’s 
useful to draw a diagram of all the connections that will be 
made through your site – a user should be able to get to where 
they want with the minimum number of clicks. The menu could 
be anywhere in the layout, and some Flash-based sites tease 
the user by hiding the hot links around the page. The most 
logical places, however, are either along the top, under the logo/
banner, or down one of the side columns, ‘above the fold’. 
If the website is of a set width, the number of menu items 
that can be displayed in a horizontal menu will be limited, although 
a submenu for each item can be created as a pull-down or 
pop-up menu, which appears as the mouse rolls over the menu 
item. If you are not sure how many items will be in your menu, or 
there are likely to be additions in the future, it is better to consider 
a vertical menu – in the left-hand column for users used to 
Western languages. Submenus can be pop-ups or simple indented 
lists that appear when a menu item is clicked. Always include a 
way to get to the home page, and on long pages add a link or 
button that takes the viewer back to the top of the page.
To do this, add the following internal anchor at the top of 
the content just below the <body> tag:
<a name="top"></a>
and at the bottom of the page, and at intermediate points if it 	
is a very long page, add the code:
<p><a href="#top">^top</a></p>
This can work the other way round too: a menu at the top of the 
page could take visitors directly to the start points of various 
headed sections below.
In a complex site, with many levels of navigation, it may be 
useful to include ‘breadcrumbs’ to remind users where they are 
located within the site, especially if they have been brought to a 
specific page by a search engine. The term comes from the trail 
of breadcrumbs left in the woods by Hansel and Gretel in the 
Grimms’ fairytale. They typically appear horizontally across the 
top of a web page, usually below title bars or headers. For a 
portfolio page, for example, it would take the form: 
Home page > Portfolio > Landscapes > Abstract landscapes
allowing the user to return to a particular section, subsection 	
or to the home page with one click of the mouse.
http://www.gavinpotenza.com/
3.15 The navigation for the website of 
Portland-based illustrator and designer 
Gavin Potenza is top right of the window 
and comprises just four menu items – 
Work, Weblog, Résumé, Profile – which 
show up on every page; you can always 
return home by clicking his name at top 
left. A central submenu takes you to 
different aspects of his portfolio

Chapter 3
Say you want to add a portfolio page to your website: a page 
of thumbnails that when you click on one you are taken to a 
page with a larger image on it? The thumbnail and its caption 
can be contained within a <div>, but as there will be more 
than one of them and <div> IDs have to be unique, this is 
best achieved using a class, for example:
.thumbnail {
 float: left;
 width: 180px;
 margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;
}
Remember that margins are defined in the clockwise order, 
top, right, bottom, left, so here we have added a 30px space to 
the right of the <div>. The HTML for each thumbnail/caption 
combo would look like this:
<div class="thumbnail">
<img src="thumbnail-1.jpg" width="180" height="200" border="0" 
alt="Sunflowers" />
<p class="caption">Sunflowers</p>
</div>
Adding a link to a page called big-image-1.html that will 
contain the larger image, we have: 
<div class="thumbnail">
<a href="big-image-1.html"><img src="thumbnail-1.jpg" 
width="180" height="200" border="0" alt="Sunflowers" ></a>
<p class="caption">Sunflowers</p>
</div>
This chunk of code is repeated for each of the different 
thumbnails, changing the image name and caption each time. 
If you want to limit the rows to three thumbnails across (Fig 
3.16), then add a clear after the third chunk of code:
<br class="clearboth" />
The portfolio layout will be developed in Step-by-step 3 
and we will improve the typography in Chapter 4.
This introduction shows that CSS is very versatile and need 
not be daunting – and that web design is a rare field in which 
the graphic designer can have complete control over design 
and production. But why reinvent the wheel? The web is full 	
of people who have already written basic layouts that can be 
freely used as long as credit to source is included in the code. 
Check out, for example, www.code-sucks.com (from which 
the above examples were adapted) and www.oswd.org.
Nesting divs
3.16 Most designers will want some sort 
of portfolio site, comprising thumbnails 
and pages (or pop-up windows) 
containing a larger version of the image. 
This can be achieved using an image plus 
caption <div> combo, as in this website 
by Geneva-based graphic design studio

Chapter 3
websites accessible and inclusive, not just because it may be 
difficult to change your website some time in the future when 
someone complains, but it also makes sound business and 
moral sense to be accessible – there are 50 million people in 
the USA with a disability, and many of them use the internet – 
do you really want to turn your back on potential users?
It is not difficult to be helpful. Basically, if your site is built  
to W3C standards, which means valid HTML and CSS that 
passes AA-level conformance with the WAI (Web Accessibility 
Initiative) WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) – see 
www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/ – then you will at least be making 
an effort, and improving the compliance of your website. In 
2002, the European Parliament set the minimum level of 
accessibility for all public sector websites to be at level AA by 
December 2008.
Practical steps 
What this means in practice is that you need to provide 
alternatives for people who have hearing or vision disabilities, 
and make sure your website does not rely on a single sense or 
ability of the user, with the proviso that some users may need 
additional accessibility-related software or peripheral devices. 
The first step to accessibility is to add a DOCTYPE 
(document type definition) right at the top of your code – your 
website won’t validate without one. In this book we have been 
striving to use strict XHTML – in English – and the DOCTYPE 
for that would be:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
There is also a transitional version of XHTML that is less 
strict and allows deprecated (phased-out) tags and older styles 
of usage to work in older browsers.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
It is possible that your website may validate with one 
DOCTYPE and fail with the other.
Other factors to consider include having sufficient contrast 
in colour schemes for individuals with low vision and colour 
blindness (see Chapter 5), and text-only versions of pages that 
incorporate multimedia, such as audio, video and Flash. Use 
relative units, such as em or percentage lengths, rather than 
absolute units, such as pt or cm (see Chapter 4). Above all, 
By the 1990s, people were becoming much more aware that 
some members of society – those with disabilities – simply did 
not have access to many of the places most able-bodied 
people take for granted, so much so that certain requirements 
to avoid discrimination due to disability were enshrined in law. 
In the United States, the Disabilities Act of 1990 defined a 
disability as ‘a physical or mental impairment that substantially 
limits a major life activity’. Major life activities are defined as 
including ‘seeing, hearing … learning, reading, concentrating, 
thinking, communicating and working’. The UK’s Disability 
Discrimination Act 1995 (both acts have been amended since) 
and laws in other countries cover similar ground.
So, along with changes like providing ramps into shops 
and public buildings for wheelchair users, employers, with 
certain exceptions, must have accessible computer equipment 
and public organizations are expected to provide information 	
in alternative formats (such as large print). The UK government 
issued a consultation document in 2008, Delivering Inclusive 
Websites, making it a legal obligation for web designers to 
ensure that blind or partially sighted people can access official 
sites. If your website makes it impossible or unreasonably 
difficult for a disabled person to access information or services 
(the example often cited in guidelines is of a public flight 
reservation and booking service), you could be sued and told 
to take down your site. In the USA, Section 508 of the US 
Rehabilitation Act is a comprehensive set of rules intended to 
help web designers make Federal sites accessible to people 
with disabilities, including employees and the public.
There are four main categories of disability to consider: 
• vision impairment 
• motor difficulties 
• cognitive and learning difficulties, including dyslexia
• deafness or hardness of hearing
Users with vision impairment may use screen-reader 
software or may need to magnify text and images, viewing only 
a portion of the page at a time. Users who are quadriplegic 
might use speech-recognition software and people with less 
severe motor disorders may have issues with mouse control, 
navigation or forms. Elderly users could have a combination of 
reduced vision, restricted mobility and decline in memory.
To date there have been no legal actions taken against a 
website, but it is only a matter of common decency to make 
Accessibility

Layout
	
Here is an accessibility checklist:
	
• Add a valid DOCTYPE.
	
• Keep the content simple, avoiding jargon and complex words.
	
• Avoid justified text, as users with dyslexia find this more difficult to 	
	
	 read than if the text is left-aligned. 
	
• Use a sans-serif font such as Verdana or Arial – these are easier to 	
	
	 read on screen.
	
• Avoid images of text, which cannot have their appearance altered  
	
	 by the user.
	
• Ensure that font size can be increased.
	
• Ensure that links have a large clickable area.
	
• Use descriptive links – avoiding the use of ‘click here’, for example. 	
	
	 This is important for screen-reader users.
	
• Provide a site map to allow users to gain an overall feel for the layout 	
	
	 and allow direct access to any page on the website.
	
• Put a ‘Back to Top’ link between sections and provide ‘skip links’ for 	
	
	 users accessing the website via the keyboard.
	
• Ensure that all functionality is available through the keyboard, by 	
	
	 tabbing for example, as well as via the mouse.
	
• Use images and icons for users with cognitive impairments.
	
• Provide meaningful alternative <alt> text for images.
	
• Allow for colour flexibility – some dyslexic users, for example, find it 	
	
	 more comfortable to read text on certain coloured backgrounds.
	
• Use good contrasting colours.
	
• Ensure that any distracting animations can be paused, skipped or 	
	
	 switched off.
	
• Provide a consistent design throughout the website.
	
• Make use of white space to separate design elements.
make sure that documents are marked up with the proper 
structural elements – when content is organized logically, it will 
be rendered in a meaningful order if style sheets are turned off 
or not supported. When in doubt – keep it simple.
One possible drawback to using floats, for example, is that 
the text in the floating elements will appear above and before the 
main content, so that a visually impaired person using a screen 
reader will have to listen to all the items in the menu every time 
they access a new page. This can be worked around by placing 
divs within divs (like the old nested tables), with say the content 
and sidebar within another wrapper, thus changing the source 
order and making the content come first. But there again, most 
screen-reader users do expect the navigation to come first and 
may find content before the navigation disorientating – so it 
may not be such a problem after all. Common-sense, meaningful 
headings, structural labels and links that enable users to skip 
content and move on to relevant sections are much more useful.
Why text-only content? Text can be converted to synthesized 
speech or Braille, making the information accessible to people 
with a variety of sensory and other disabilities. A simple example 
is the <alt> tag of an image, which must convey the purpose 	
of the image, not just its description, to be really effective. 
Conversely, non-text equivalents of text, such as pre-recorded 
speech, or a video of a person translating the text into sign 
language, can make websites accessible to individuals with 
cognitive disabilities, learning disabilities and deafness.
Once you have done as much as you can to consider the 
needs of disabled people, validate your pages using W3C’s 
Markup Validation Service http://validator.w3.org/ and W3C’s 
CSS Validation Service http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and 
perhaps think about adding an accessibility statement such as:
This <website name> is committed to ensuring access 	
for people with disabilities. Each page on our website will 
conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(WCAG) Level Double-A.
along with information for users (Fig 3.17) on how they can 
configure their browsers to customize and enhance their 
experience (increase text size or change the background 
colour, for example). The BBC website http://www.bbc.co.uk/
accessibility/ is a good example. Finally, a ‘human review’ by 
real users with disabilities will provide you with valuable feedback 
about any accessibility problems and how they can be solved.

Usability
The term ‘accessibility’ is used to describe the degree to which 
a website can be understood by as many people as possible. 
‘Usability’, however, describes the extent to which a website 
can be used with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction within 
a specified context of use (Fig 3.18). There is obviously 	a good 
deal of overlap: ideally an accessible site should be usable, 
and vice versa.
Usability guru Jakob Nielsen (www.useit.com) has set out 
guidelines for usability but has been criticized by some graphic 
designers for not taking into account design factors such as 
eye appeal. If you look at websites such as amazon.com or 
ebay.com, they may not use cutting-edge design, but they are 
very successful in what they set out to do, presenting a 
reasonably pleasant and efficient user experience. While 
usability might not dictate the design of your website, keeping 
the principles of usability at the back of your mind while 
designing can produce a more elegant and functional design. 
As Nielsen points out: ‘People have to be able to grasp the 
functioning of the site immediately after scanning the home 
page – for a few seconds at most.’ And remember that not all 
users arrive via the front page, especially if they have found 
your site through a search engine.
3.17 If you have made your website 
accessible, then tell your readers about it 
with instructions on how to change text 
size, for example, as on this Disability Arts 
Online website
3.18 As this BBC blog points out, 77% of 
users will return to a website if it is easy 
to use, only 22% will return because it’s 
their favourite brand
	
Here are some simple ways to ensure usability:
	
• Be concise – use short screen-size pages.
	
• Structure your text with two or three levels of headlines (a general 	
	
	 page heading plus subheads).
	
• Use meaningful rather than cryptic headings – reading a heading 	
	
	 should tell the user what the page or section is about.
	
• Use emphasis to make important words catch the user’s eye – bold or 	
	
	 coloured text – but avoid the less legible italics wherever possible.
	
• Put concise introductory paragraphs on the home page, full of 	
	
	 keywords, describing the site content and stating the purpose of the 	
	
	 website. This will also help the search engines.
	
• Restrict to one idea per paragraph (users may skip over any additional 	
	
	 ideas if they are not caught by the first few words).
	
• Use lists, indents, summaries and plenty of bullet points.
	
• Many users don’t like to scroll, so they will only read the top part of an 	
	
	 article. Write in the journalists’ ‘inverted pyramid’ style with the most 	
	
	 important and interesting stuff at the beginning – as Walter Matthau 	
	
	 asks Jack Lemmon in the newsroom movie The Front Page, ‘Who’s 	
	
	 gonna read the second paragraph?’ Interested readers will scroll down 	
	
	 for greater detail.
	
• Make each page a self-contained entity: users come through many 	
	
	 portals and can go anywhere they like – they will not necessarily read 	
	
	 your text in your order.
	
• Use hyperlinks rather than repeating information found elsewhere.
	
• Place external links on a ‘Further information’ page rather than in the 	
	
	 text. Grouping links to other sites at the end means readers are 	
	
	 retained and rewarded.

Step-by-step 2
A simple handmade XHTML/CSS website 
using a template
Step 1.
The aim is to create a very simple but 
functional website that will conform to 
XHTML and CSS standards. First we 
download a public-domain template from 
www.code-sucks.com (right). It will be a 
two-column fixed-width layout comprising 
a header, menu sidebar and area for the 
main content (below right). It does not 
look much yet, but with CSS it can quickly 
be customized.
The template comprises two files: an 
HTML document called index.html, which 
we will open in PageSpinner, and a CSS 
document called main.css, which we will 
open in Style Master. Rename the folder 
they came in if you wish, to reflect the 
project. Add a subfolder called images, in 
which we will store our images.

Style Master and CSSEdit for CSS are all available. There are 
also many generous developers on the net offering tried-and-
tested templates and code snippets as open source for you to 
use, as long as the creator is acknowledged on the website – 
usually within the source code itself as a comment. All you need 
to provide is your content – words and pictures. If you can cut 
and paste, then you can create a website.
Layout
Step 2.
First we shall create a banner in Photoshop, 
920px wide and 120px high, to fit the header 
<div>. The template header is 900px wide 
with padding of 10px either side, so 900 + 
10 + 10 = 920. This banner is added to the 
CSS as a non-repeating (tiling) background 
image by adding the following code to the 
#header:
background: url(images/banner.
jpg) no-repeat;
While in Photoshop use the eyedropper to 
choose a colour from the sky, in this case 
#c6d7d5, and paste into kuler (kuler.adobe.
com) to create an analogous colour scheme 
(see Chapter 5) for the two columns (right).
The layout using this colour scheme can be 
tested in a browser (below right).
This is the Header

Step 4.
To style the h1 header, in Style Master hit 
the ‘cog’ button at bottom left and choose 
New Type Selector, then h1 from the 
menu. We can then give it a colour, size, 
weight and font family, centre it and add 
some bottom margin, as shown right:
Similarly, we can style the <p> tag and the 
<a> links, remembering the mnemonic 
‘LoVe? HA!’ (see page 64) to get the <a> 
tags in the correct order (far right).  
Kuler was used again for the colour 
scheme, starting with a colour sampled 
from the sea in the banner. Setting  
text-decoration: none removes 
the default underlining.
Step 3.
Now to add some content. The menu will 
go in the left column and we will need the 
following pages: Home (where we are 
now), About me (for our biography or CV), 
Portfolio (to showcase our best work), 
Blog (for up-to-date news), Links (to other 
sites, in the hope that they will link back to 
ours) and Contact (so that potential clients 
can contact us). This code is placed 
between <div id="leftcolumn"> 
and </div> (top).
The main text will appear in the right column, 
and to accommodate it, we raise the 
height of each column to 750px in the CSS.
The HTML code for the main content is 
shown middle.
Note the escape code &copy; for the 
copyright symbol. Note also that the text 
has yet to be formatted in the CSS – what 
you are seeing so far are the browser 
defaults (bottom).

Layout
Step 5.
We can also add a class for the photo 
captions to centre them. 
	 p.caption {
 		font-size: .9em;
 		text-align: center; 
	 }
The HTML would look like:
	 <p class="caption">Brighton 	 	
	 Pavilion</p>
Centring the image is not so simple – we 
need a workaround:
	 img.displayed {
 		display: block;
 		margin-left: auto;
 		margin-right: auto 
	 }
The completed home page can be seen 
top right. The HTML document in 
PageSpinner can be seen middle and the 
CSS in Style Master at the bottom. What 
still needs to be done is to make up all the 
other pages. The simplest way is to ‘save 
as’ the new page, and replace the content. 
Remember also to add meta tags for the 
search engines to the head of the HTML 
document. When all is ready it can be 
uploaded to your host using FTP. In the 	
next Step-by-step (see pages 102–5) we 
will create the portfolio page.

Chapter 3
Trailblazer 2
Erik Spiekermann 
‘What I believe is that, after all the hype about the New Economy, 
we are going back to the original reason for being on Earth: to 
find ways to improve our lives, and the way we live together, 
and to preserve this planet. As graphic designers, we contribute 
to this by making things easy to use and pleasant to behold. 
That can be a website, a timetable, a magazine or even a legible 
and beautiful typeface.’ Large-scale websites involve teamwork 
and Spiekermann is always proud to credit those involved in 
their design and production.
Erik Spiekermann is Honorary Professor at the University of 
the Arts in Bremen and Past President of ISTD, the International 
Society of Typographic Designers. In 2006, the Art Center 
College of Design in Pasadena awarded him an Honorary 
Doctorship for his contribution to design and in 2007 he was 
the first designer to be elected into the Hall of Fame by the 
European Design Awards for Communication Design. Also in 
2007 he was awarded Honorary Royal Designer for Industry by 
the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures 
& Commerce, London. In 2009 he became the European Union’s 
Ambassador for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.

Erik Spiekermann will always be celebrated for designing the 
font Meta, but he was also an early pioneer of information 
systems and web design, with his clear grid-based websites  
in his trademark red and black. He was an early adopter 	
of blogging, and his domain spiekermann.com now redirects 
straight to his (red and black) blog.
Spiekermann was born in Stadthagen, Germany. He 
funded his own studies, in art history at the Free University in 
Berlin by setting metal type and operating a printing press in 
the basement of his home. After seven years working freelance 
in London in the 1970s, principally for Wolff Olins and Pentagram, 
he returned to Berlin, founding MetaDesign with Dieter Heil and 
Florian Fischer in 1979, where he worked on projects for Audi, 
Skoda, Volkswagen, Lexus, Heidelberg Printing, Berlin Transit 
and Düsseldorf Airport. In 1984, the company was bought by 
Sedley Place Design, and Spiekermann left to work as 
MetaDesign Mk 2. 
Spiekermann founded FontShop with his then wife Joan 	
in 1989, along with partners Neville Brody in the UK and the 
late Ed Cleary in Canada. This was followed by his own-brand 
FontFont label. In 1992 Spiekermann co-founded MetaDesign 
West in San Francisco, with Terry Irwin and Bill Hill, ostensibly 
because he needed ‘a work excuse to spend more time in 
California’. In 2001 Spiekermann left MetaDesign again and 
started UDN (United Designers Network), with offices in 	
Berlin, London and San Francisco. UDN was renamed 
SpiekermannPartners in 2007, and in 2009 it merged with 
Amsterdam-based Eden Design & Communication to create 
EdenSpiekermann, a company that employs 100 people in 
Amsterdam and Berlin.
Meta began life as a corporate typeface for the German 
post office to try end the ‘chaos’ created through the use of 
dozens of versions of Helvetica in the organization, but ended 
with the client’s decision to stick with Helvetica, because to 
change would ‘cause unrest’. Spiekermann also designed 
Officina and a Charles Rennie Mackintosh-inspired typeface  
for Glasgow City of Architecture and Design 1999.
No conference about type and typography is complete 
without an appearance by Erik Spiekermann. Newcomers in 
the audience are struck first by his bilingual articulation and 
then by his humour, at once acerbic and self-deprecating. His 
ability to communicate (‘not called speaker-man for nothing’) 
has speeded his international recognition. Spiekermann’s 
speciality is creating order from chaos: information design. This 
is achieved through care in type selection, sometimes type 
creation, and especially through typographic clarity. He says:

videos to make the content more dynamic. 
It is available in German and English, though 
the content is not always the same. Both 
Spiekerblog and the edenspiekermann site 
subscribe to the paid service Typekit so 
they can use typefaces other than 
websafe fonts on their pages. Body type is 
set in Espi Slab Regular, headlines in Espi 
Sans Bold, Twitter Feeds in Espi Sans 
Regular and Bold. Espi is their inhouse 
version of FF Unit and FF Unit Slab.

ddp (Deutscher Depeschendienst) and 
German Associated Press merged to form

company. The new corporate design was 
launched not only through publications 
and business cards, but also through 
office templates, bringing the brand to 
everybody’s desk and computer.

Microsite, and helped create a buzz on 
Twitter. The screenshot shows the new

Spiekermann’s approach to information 
design is the website for the Berlin 
Philharmonic Orchestra. He says: ‘I think 
we need complex information systems 
that enable the user to find everything 
effortlessly, while offering an aesthetically 
pleasing experience.’ The website is 
powered by TYPO3, a free open-source 
Content Management Framework initially 
created by Kasper Skaarhoj. The team 
involved in the redesign include: Robert 
Stulle (Creative Director), Marcus Scheller 
(Interaction Designer), Sven Ellingen

Text and 
typography
In recent years, graphic designers working in print have been spoilt for 
choice with the number and variety of fonts they can use in their layouts. 
Yet it was not always so. Before digital desktop publishing, back in the 
days of hot-metal type and phototypesetting, only a few of the classic 
fonts were available and new fonts were rare – they represented a huge 
investment by the type foundries and were expensive for printers to buy. 
A similar situation exists for web designers today. Strictly speaking, if the 
users of your website do not own the fonts that you may have specified 
and already have them installed on their computers, then the browser 
will render your text in the default font. 
This has led to web designers having to offer users a fallback position. 
As well as specifying a preferred font, you also have to suggest alternatives 
– with a last resort of one of the five generic descriptions of fonts: serif, 
sans serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy. 
4.1 The giant ABC typography of New 
York ‘boutique studio’ Studio Von Birken, 
founded by Katia Küthe and Philipp 
Müssigmann, may be a challenge at first, 
but once you discover the rules of 
engagement, then it’s a delight to use.

Chapter 4
Serif and sans serif fonts 
In type there are two basic kinds of font: serif and sans serif 
(Fig 4.2). Serifs are the marks at the extremities of the letterform, 
said to originate from the finishing strokes made by Roman 
stonemasons to the letters they carved, on the base of Trajan’s 
Column in Rome, for example. Sans (French for ‘without’), 
means that the typeface has no serifs and is more modern-
looking. Sans serif fonts are more legible on screen – thin serifs 
can disappear or look too large on screen. 
Serif faces include Times New Roman and Georgia. To 
define serif fonts the CSS would be:
p { font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; } 
Note that if the name of a font is more than one word, it 
must be contained within quotation marks.
Sans serif fonts include Helvetica (Microsoft’s variant is 
Arial) and Verdana. A third category is the monospace font, in 
which all letters occupy spaces that have the same width, as 
they are on old-fashioned manual typewriters. A common 
example is Courier. Cursive fonts, also known as script, are like 
joined-up handwriting, such as Brush Script – the sort you see 
on wedding invitations. The generic fantasy category covers all 
the rest – fonts that are primarily decorative, including the one 
that designers love to hate, Comic Sans MS (Fig 4.3).
Before we discuss fonts in more detail, let’s go back to 
basics and set out some definitions.
Old-school HTML used the <font> tag, which is now, in the 
parlance of web standards, ‘deprecated’. It has not been 
totally eliminated, so as to ensure some backward compatibility 
with existing older websites and browsers, but its use is to be 
avoided and it may well be withdrawn in the future. The <font> 
tag’s biggest disadvantage was that it had to be wrapped 
around every single scrap of text, increasing the file size 
considerably and making future maintenance problematic.
<p><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif" 
size="2" color="#0000af">The text goes here.</font></p>
Now you can forget all about it. New-school HTML is much 
simpler, thus:
<p>The text goes here.</p>
The styling is now all done in the CSS code (either in the <head> 
of the document or preferably in a standalone external page):
p { font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }
For simplicity, the size and colour properties have been 
omitted for now. This says to the user’s browser: ‘For any text 
enclosed by a <p> paragraph tag, please use the font Verdana, 
but if you have not got Verdana on your hard drive, use Arial 
(for PCs) or Helvetica (for Macs), and failing that, any generic 
sans serif font you can find.’ Verdana, however, is a common 
font specially designed for the web and given away free by 
Microsoft, so in this case the alternatives may not have to be 
invoked. The final semi-colon (;) is optional, but is best left in 
as you may want to add other properties at a later date.

Text and typography
Before text came to mean a short message on a mobile 
phone, it meant raw copy, more likely nowadays to be called 
‘content’. Text is the ‘meaning’ part of type: just plain words 
plus the spaces between them, devoid of any information 
about the typefaces, sizes, measures or weights being used. 	
It is always best to compose your text first in a text editor or 
word processor. 
But be warned, programs such as Microsoft Word can in 
fact be too helpful. HTML can handle only the most common 
symbols and punctuation: curly quotation marks, apostrophes 
and em and en dashes left in the text may cause spurious 
characters to appear when the browser renders the page. So 
convert curly quotes and apostrophes to the symbols for feet 
(') and inches ("), or use the escape characters &#34; or &quot; 
or the more specific code listed to the right.
As we saw on page 29, some common symbols have 
been reserved for special uses in the code and cannot be  
used ‘as is’. To the right are some common escape entities,  
as mnemonics and with their decimal equivalents (with 
hexadecimal versions in parentheses). Hexadecimal numbers 
(numbers in base 16, viz 0–9 plus a–f) are a throwback to the 
computer science origins of the internet. Computers are 
happiest dealing with binary numbers (numbers in base 2, 
namely 0 and 1) but these are unwieldy for humans, who prefer 
decimal (numbers in base 10, namely 0–9); hexadecimal (hex 
for short) numbers, however, translate directly to binary and as 
we shall see in Chapter 5 are also used to define colours (see 
page 114). Some browsers have trouble interpreting 
mnemonics (you will spot unexpected characters appearing 
when you preview your page), so the decimal or the hex 
equivalents must be used.
As mentioned in Chapter 2, a full list of code equivalents 
for common symbols can be found at www.w3schools.com/
tags/ref_entities.asp. The big advantage of using a web-specific 
text editor such as BBEdit or PageSpinner is that they make it 
easier for you to add these essential codes, instead of having 
to type them out by hand.
Once you have input your text and turned it into web pages, 
print it out and proofread it away from the computer. Better still, 
get a colleague to read the proof – mistakes are often invisible 
to those who make them. Proofreading is vital now that designers 
are expected to set text as they are laying out designs.

The language 
of type
optimized to work well at that particular size. In computer setting, 
however, it is common for one single design to be enlarged or 
reduced to make all the sizes. In a digital page-layout system 
or word processor on your computer, a menu item labelled 
‘font’ will in fact display a list of the available typefaces.
A complete set of sorts will also include some or all of  
the following:
• alternative letters, for the ends of lines, for example, and 	
	 ornamented or ‘swash’ capitals (but try to avoid setting 	
	 whole lines of swash letters)
• diphthongs, such as æ and œ
• ligatures, such as ﬁ and ﬂ (in books of poetry, you may even

• accented letters for setting foreign languages, such as à (grave),	
	 é (acute), ô (circumflex), ü (diaresis), ç (cedilla), ñ (tilde)
• numerals or figures, which can be lining or non-lining 		
	 (sometimes called ‘old-style’ numbers). Georgia, for example, 	
	 uses old-style (non-lining) figures, whereas Times New 	
	 Roman has lining figures (Fig 4.6)
The terms ‘font’ and ‘typeface’ are often used interchangeably 
these days. Strictly speaking, a font is defined as a complete 
set in one size of all the letters of the alphabet, complete with 
associated ligatures (joined letters), numerals, punctuation 
marks and any other signs and symbols (Fig 4.5), collectively 
called ‘sorts’ (hence the expression ‘out of sorts’). The word 
‘font’, or ‘fount’ as it used to be spelt in Europe, derives from 
‘found’, as in type foundry, and reminds us of the days when 
typesetting involved molten metal-type cast from moulds.
‘Typeface’, often shortened to ‘face’, is the name given to 
the look and design of the alphabet and its associated marks 
and symbols. Every typeface has a name. This can be the name 
of its designer, for example Garamond, Bodoni or Baskerville. 	
It can take the name of the newspaper or publication it was 
originally designed for, for example Times New Roman or 
Century. Or it may just have a fanciful name intended to convey 
the ‘feel’ of the face, for example Optima, Perpetua or Futura.
In the days of hot-metal setting there would be a slightly 
different design – or font – for each physical size of type,

A font of roman type will comprise three alphabets:
• capitals, also called upper case, so named because of the 	
	 position of the letters in a compositor’s typecase (abbreviated 	
	 to caps or u.c.)
• small letters, also known as lower case (abbreviated to l.c.)
• perhaps small capitals, which are capitals the height of 	
	 a lower-case letter
Italic and bold fonts contain just two alphabets: capitals and 
lower case.
A family is a set of fonts related to the basic roman 
typeface, which may include italic and bold plus a whole 
spectrum of different ‘weights’. These range from ultra light 	
to ultra bold. It will also include different widths, ranging from 
ultra condensed to ultra expanded. Univers, for example, was 
designed by Adrian Frutiger in 1957 to have 21 fonts, in five 
weights and four widths. A series is a complete range of sizes 
in the same typeface.
This is well and good for graphic designers working in 
print, but for web designers all these variations may not be 
available and, as we have seen, some non-standard characters 
and symbols will have to be replaced by escape entities.
Fonts you can be confident are common to both PCs and 
Macs are sometimes called websafe fonts (Fig 4.7). They all 
have bold variants and most have italic versions – for an

and descenders, for example), the stress (is it oblique or 
vertical?), the contrast between thick and thin strokes, the 
formation of the serifs. Are the characters wide and loose-fitting, 
or compact and tight? Some are easy: script and ‘black letter’ 
faces, for example, stand out from all the others. 
Verdana, designed by Matthew Carter, and named after 
the verdant Seattle area, was designed specifically for website 
use. Microsoft released the initial version of the font in 1996 	
as part of its core fonts for the web collection and it has since 
been bundled with Internet Explorer. It is extended and has 
extra space between characters so they do not touch, particularly 
with letter combinations such as ‘fi’ ‘fl’ and ‘ff’, which would be 
ligatures in print. The bolds are very bold, so you can always 
tell the difference between bold and roman, yet the bold 
characters will not fill in, even at small sizes (Fig 4.10). Special 
care has been taken with such letters as 1, i, l, I and J, 	
adding serifs to the upper-case I and J so that they are easily 
distinguishable. The lower-case i is slightly shorter than the 
lower-case l, curves are kept to a minimum and lower-case 
Distinguishing typefaces
Each typeface has its own distinctive characteristics, called 
‘earmarks’ (Fig 4.8), named after the distinctive ‘ear’ on the 
lower-case g. These enable us to identify one design from another. 
To distinguish Helvetica from Univers, for example, look for the 
vertical downstroke in the capital G, the curly tail of the lower-
case y, and the angled tail through the bowl of the Q (Fig 4.9).
	
Identifying typefaces
	
When trying to identify a typeface, a good strategy is to start with the 	
	
Q (a letter so infrequently used that typographers often have fun with 	
	
it, making it their trademark), then the ampersand, then the J, G and W. 	
	
Try the lower-case g, then a, j and y. For numbers, look first at 3, then 	
	
1, 7, 5 and 2.
Other features that help to distinguish different typefaces 
are the overall proportions (the relation of x-height to ascenders

characters are a pixel taller than their upper-case counterparts at 
key screen sizes. Carter also designed Verdana’s serif companion 
Georgia, which is larger than Times at the same point size, with 
a greater x-height.
Increasing your choice of typefaces
Graphic designers frustrated by the lack of choice in fonts for 
websites have resorted to several tricks over the years. First they 
would substitute headings and menu items, for example, with 
the text in the desired font rendered as a graphic, and sometimes 
even whole pages rendered as one big GIF or JPEG. This plays 
havoc with the search engines, even if alt tags are used, and 
makes life difficult for anybody making changes in the future. 
Graphic ‘text’ also reduces the accessibility of your web page.
Mac OS X uses a graphics technology called Quartz to 
display true PostScript anti-aliased fonts on screen. Windows 
uses a similar technology called ClearType to accomplish the 
same thing. With this ability to display true versions of typefaces 
Chapter 4
in web browsers, you would think typography on the web would 
be booming. But it is not, and why? Because no one has yet 
solved the problem of how to deliver custom typefaces to people 
who do not have them installed. 
The fonts installed on most Macs and PCs are termed 
websafe fonts (see page 90). In CSS3, a CSS rule called  
@font-face enables you to use some specially licensed non-
websafe fonts in your designs. You link to them as you would 
to an image. In the style sheet, the CSS code to style an h1 
heading, for example, using a TrueType font designed by Ray 
Larabie, would be:
@font-face {
 font-family: "Kimberley";
 src: url(http://www.princexml.com/fonts/larabie/kimberle.ttf)
 format("truetype");
}
h1 { font-family: "Kimberley", sans-serif }
4.9 Univers was the most popular sans-
serif face until desktop publishing came 
along and pushed Helvetica (and its PC 
equivalent Arial) into top spot. With the 
web came Verdana, optimized for screen 
viewing. Note that Arial has some features 
of Univers, in the capital G for example

Text and typography
Text styled using these web fonts is searchable, scales 
crisply when zoomed, and is accessible to users with screen 
readers. The API takes care of converting the font into a format 
compatible with any modern browser (including Internet Explorer 
6 and up), sends just the styles and weights you select, and the 
font files and CSS are tuned and optimized for web serving. 
Another solution is to use sIFR (scalable Inman Flash 
Replacement) text, developed by Mike Davidson, based on the 
work of Shaun Inman. Flash (see Chapter 6) is vector-based, 
so can produce crisp lettering. By using a combination of 
JavaScript, CSS and Flash, sIFR replaces plain browser text 
with the designer’s typeface of choice, regardless of whether 
or not users have that font installed on their systems. A 
JavaScript function (see Chapter 6) is first run to check that 
Flash is installed and then looks for whatever tags, IDs or 
classes you designate. If Flash is not installed (or if JavaScript 
is turned off), the (X)HTML page displays as normal and 
nothing further occurs. If Flash is installed, the script creates 
Flash movies the same size as the designated elements and 
Browsers that support @font-face will render text using 
Kimberley while older browsers will use the default sans serif 
face. Make sure that the particular font you wish to use is freely 
available for use with @font-face.
Google has also entered the font arena with an open-
source collection of fonts available free of charge. The Google 
font directory contains a range of fonts accessed by an API 
(application programming interface) enabled by the CSS3  
@font-face standard. Available fonts are listed at http://
code.google.com/webfonts and this will grow over time. To 
use the font Tangerine by Toshi Omagari, for example, add 	
the HTML to the head:
<link href ='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tangerine' 
rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
and in the CSS:
h1 { font-family: 'Tangerine', serif; }

Chapter 4
The way type is measured dates back to the days of hot metal. 
In 1737, the Frenchman Pierre Fournier le Jeune invented the 
point system of measurement, by dividing the French inch into 
12 ‘lines’ which were further subdivided into six points. Some 
half-century later, around 1785, another Parisian, François-
Ambroise Didot, settled on a standard – the didot point – which 
is used in continental Europe to this day.
In the United States, the point was standardized by the 
American Type Founders’ Association in 1886 to be 0·013837in 
(or 0·3515mm). Recently, the point has been further rationalized 
to make it exactly 1⁄72 in (0·01389in or 0·3528mm). 
A pica is 12 points, and so measures 1⁄6 in (4.2mm). 
(The didot equivalent to the pica is the cicero.) Although with 
computerized systems type can be of any height, its size is  
still generally measured in points, abbreviated to pt.
The use of points to specify size refers back to metal 
letterpress type. When a font is described as 6pt or 18pt, what 
is really being measured is the height of the body of lead that 
the letter sits on. This is the total height from the lowest extremity 
of a descender (the long vertical down-stroke of a letter such 
as p or q) to the top of the tallest ascender (the long vertical 
up-stroke of a letter such as k or d), with a little extra space top 
and bottom. This is usually called the k-p height.
A more exact way of defining point size is to say that it is 
the distance from baseline to baseline when type is set solid 
(without leading, which we will come to later).
Some typefaces have longer ascenders and descenders 
than others, so it is quite possible for two typefaces to be the 
same point size but to appear smaller or larger. A more visually 
accurate method of describing size is to use the x-height. The 
lower-case letter x is used because all its terminals (ends) touch 
a line of measurement. Georgia, for example, has a bigger 
x-height than Times.
Type below 14pt is called body type, text, or book type. 
Type above 14pt is called display type. Some display types 	
are so decorative as to be unsuitable for text setting and are 
available in capitals only.
Measuring type in CSS
In CSS, size can be absolute or relative. Absolute sizes include 
inches, millimetres, points and pixels; relative sizes include 
keywords, ems, exes and percentages. It is not considered 
good practice to use the font-size property to create headings 
– the structural heading tags h1, h2 and so on should always 
be used and defined accordingly.
How type 
is measured
overlays them to hide the text, pumping in the browser text in 
as a Flash variable. Then the ActionScript inside each Flash file 
draws that text in your chosen typeface at a 6 point size and 
scales it up until it fits snugly inside the Flash movie. 
All this happens in a split second. However, this does not 
mean that you can replace every single word of a website with 
a fancy font – this method is meant for instances of display type 
only, so try to use restraint. For further details and updates see 
www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/. Other ways of introducing 
more fonts into your designs, which do not use Flash, include 
typekit.com (subscription-based) and the JavaScript-based Cufón.

Text and typography
Note there should be no space between number and unit. 
As with colour (see Chapter 5), CSS allows the use of 
keywords, in this case ranging from xx-small (extra extra 
small) to xx-large (extra extra large). The default browser font 
is medium, so if that is 16px, then large would be 19px, using a 
scaling factor of 1.2. There are also two relative-size keywords, 
smaller and larger, which bump the size keyword along 
the scale relative to the parent object.
So far we have not discussed the concept of inheritance, 
which is a cornerstone of CSS. The <body> tag always encloses 
a <p> tag, for example, and is thus its ‘parent’. Similarly <em> 
and <strong> tags are usually found within a <p> tag and 
are thus its ‘children’. Inheritance saves a lot of typing in CSS, 
because if we define the font family, say, in the <body> tag, 
we do not have to define it again when we style our <p> tags 
– unless you want it to be different. The <p> tag inherits the 
font family for the <body> tag. Defining a new font family for 
the <p> would, however, override the original one defined in 
the <body> tag.
The use of ems (basically multiples or fractions of the default 
size) can result in inconsistencies between browsers and 
platforms. Users may reset their default font size to something 
smaller than the usual 16px. Internet Explorer 6 users may be 
surfing with the text set at Smaller, in which case anything less 
than 1em will look microscopic. Perhaps using a percentage 
value could be a reliable method for defining size? Setting the 
<ul> list tag to 80% (of the default browser size) would result 
in text approximately 13px high. However, if another <ul> list 
was nested within this list, it would inherit the 80% and its text 
would be 10px high.
	
The Owen Briggs method
	
A popular compromise is the ‘Owen Briggs method’, which uses a 	
	
combination of ems and percentages. First we define the <body> as 	
	
76%, which brings the overall default size down from an oversize 16px 	
	
to a more designer-friendly 12px. Then the children – <p>, <h1>, etc. 	
	
– are sized in ems, which being absolute units do not accumulate in the 	
	
way percentages do, for example:
	
body { font-size: 76%; }
	
p { font-size: 1em; }
	
h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }
	
Further information, screenshots and tutorials can be found at  
	
http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/font/.
Most designers seem to favour the more precise pixel 
measurement for type height (forget inches and centimetres 
straight away), but in practice this is also a relative measurement, 
as it depends on the resolution of the end-user’s display. A 12px 
letter on a 1680 x 1050 screen will appear much smaller than 
the same letter on a 640 x 480 screen. Furthermore, browsers 
such as Internet Explorer 6 will not allow users with limited 
eyesight to enlarge text defined by pixel size. Internet Explorer 
7 does allow text resizing, so as it gradually takes over from 
the older browsers, this restriction will become less important.
An em, as we will see below, was originally a measurement 
of width rather than height (this em is not to be confused with 
the tag for emphasis). In print, this is the width of a capital M. 
Half an em is an en, which is the width of a capital N. A complete 
font provides the graphic designer with two types of dash: an 
em rule and an en rule. In CSS, an em is simply defined as the 
size of the default browser font, which is generally 16px, and 
more specifically the distance from baseline to baseline with no 
additional interlinear space, or leading. 
Another measurement in CSS that may be new to print 
designers is the ex, which also uses the default size of the font 
(the size the font is drawn at, not the default size the browser 
uses), but whereas the em uses the square in which the entire 
character resides, an ex is the height of a lower-case x – the 
same as the x-height familiar to graphic designers for print.
To recap, in CSS type can be measured in the following ways:
Absolute units
in (inches; 1in = 2.54cm)
cm (centimetres; 1cm = 10mm)
mm (millimetres)
pt (points; 1pt = 1⁄72 in)
pc (picas; 1pc = 12pt)
px (pixels, effectively 1px = 1pt)
Relative measurements
keywords: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, 
large, x-large, xx-large
em (width of capital M in default browser font)
ex (width of lc x in default browser font)
percentage
The CSS code to define a <p> tag in ems, for example, would be:
p { font-size: 0.9em; } 

96
Chapter 4
Small caps
Small caps are catered for by the font-variant property. 
Small caps are capital letters the same height as the lower-case 
letters. They are often used for acronyms in body text so they do 
not stand out too much. In print they would have slightly different 
design characteristics to proper caps. In CSS this transforms 
lower-case letters and words into scaled-down caps:
h2 { font-variant: small-caps; }
There is also a text-transform property that will auto-
matically capitalize lower-case text it comes across, useful for 
changing the look of headings, for example.
Leading
Spacing between lines of type is called leading, named after 
the strips of lead that were placed between lines of type in 
hot-metal setting (Fig 4.11). ‘Set solid’ means without leading, 
for example 10/10pt. To write 10/11pt means to ask for 10pt 
type with a 1pt space (leading) between the lines. 
Desktop publishing systems often add 1.5pt leading by 
default. Always take into account the x-height of a typeface 
when deciding on a leading value. A good rule of thumb is:  
the larger the x-height, the more the leading; the smaller the 
x-height, the less the leading.
In CSS, leading is adjusted using the line-height 
property. As in font-size, you can use px, em or percentages. 
The default browser line-height is 120%: so to tighten up the 
spacing, use a lower percentage value; or to spread the lines 
apart, use a higher value. Using a percentage value, rather than 
an absolute px or pt, means that the leading will adjust itself 
proportionally if the font size is changed. If, for example, the 
font-size is 12px and the line-height is set at 150% 
(equivalent to 18px) then the leading will be 18 – 12 = 6px.
You are also allowed to use a simple number, without 
units, for example:
p { line-height: 1.5; }
Why use 1.5 instead of 150%? If you used a percentage, 
then the calculated value would be inherited, so that, for 
example, if there was a paragraph of text on the page defined 
by a class as 24px, then the line-height would remain 	
at 18px, meaning the lines of text would be all squashed up. 
Bold
Spending so much time on so simple a property as size shows 
how versatile CSS can be. Another case in point is boldness, 
covered by the font-weight property. As well as the keywords 
normal, bold, bolder and lighter, it also provides nine 
numerical values, from 100 to 900, with 400 corresponding to 
the keyword normal and 700 to regular bold. To define a level 
h1 heading as bold, the CSS code would be:
h1 { font-weight: bold; }
or
h1 { font-weight: 700; }
The bolder and lighter values are relative to the weight 
inherited from the parent:
strong { font-weight: bolder; }
Of course, not every font is as rational as Univers, with its 
five weights and four widths. The weights of fonts are described 
using all kinds of terms, including Regular, Roman, Book, 
Medium, Semi- or DemiBold, Bold, Heavy, Black and ExtraBlack, 
so that mapping a number to a specific weight of a font is not 
easy. While some fonts may come only in normal and bold, 
and others could have as many as eight weights, the only real 
guarantee is that a face of a given value will be no less dark 
than the faces of lighter values. And your end-user may not 
even have the fonts installed. So for now, it is perhaps best to 
stick to normal and bold.
Italics
The font-style property has fewer options: normal, italic 
and oblique. An oblique font is an upright roman font that has 
been slanted, as opposed to a true italic font, which has distinct 
design differences in the letterforms, particularly in the lower-
case a and f. In this example any emphasized text within h1 
will appear in a normal face:
h1 { font-style: italic; }
h1 em { font-style: normal; }
Note that the em in the selector (after h1) is the tag for emphasis 
(usually rendered as italic) not the em unit of measurement.

Text and typography
Using the number 1.5 would simply multiply each font height by 
1.5, so the line height for the 24px text would be 24 x 1.5 = 36px.
	
All together now
	
Do you have to type out all those properties every time you give a tag 	
	
the above font properties? No, the font property is a shorthand way of 	
	
including all the font information in one line, ideally in the order:
	
font-style | font-variant | font-weight | font-size / 	
	
line-height | font-family 
	
For example:
	
h1 { font:  italic small-caps bold 1.75em/2 Verdana, 	
	
Arial, sans-serif; }
	
The list must always include font-size and font-family, in that order, as 	
	
the last two properties. Other properties can be omitted, and their value 	
	
will be taken as being the default ‘normal’.
4.11 Leading is achieved in CSS by the 
line-height property: here we see 
text set solid (top) with no added leading, 
with positive leading (centre), and 
negative leading where lines of text begin 
to overlap (bottom)

Width and spacing
In graphic design, the space around letters and words is often as 
important as the letterform itself. When characters are designed, 
they are also given space either side to prevent consecutive 
sorts from touching. These are called side bearings, and the 
information about horizontal spacing built into a typeface by its 
designer is known as its font metrics.
The width of a line of setting, or the column width of a 
publication, is called the measure, and is sometimes measured 
in picas, but more usually nowadays in millimetres. As we have 
seen, another convenient method of measurement is the em. 
The em is not an absolute measurement. Its size will vary 
depending on the typeface and its point size. A 1em indent in 
10pt type is 10pt, as a 1em indent in 18pt type is 18pt, so that 
it will always be in proportion with the rest of the setting. 
	
Reversing out
	
Some websites have reversed-out text – light-coloured text on a dark 	
	
background, most often white on black. White on black is harder on the 	
	
eyes than black on white: the letters need to be wider apart, lighter in 	
	
weight and with more space between the lines, so make sure you 	
	
increase the leading and tracking and decrease the font weight.
Kerning and tracking
By adjusting pairs of certain letters containing extremities that 
might invade the space of other letters, such as Y, W, L and T, 
it is possible to bring them closer together and improve the 
visual appearance of a word. This is called kerning (Fig 4.13). 
In hot metal, kerning was only possible by physically cutting 
away the metal body of the type. With computer systems, there 
are no restrictions on the extent of kerning possible. Adjusting 
the spacing between all the letters is called tracking (Fig 4.14). 
Tracking should not be confused with kerning, which takes place 
only between pairs of letters. Negative tracking can be used to 
tighten up the spacing of text, particularly with sans serif faces.
Tracking is covered by the letter-spacing property. 
The default normal is equivalent to zero. All the usual 
measurements are allowed, as are negative amounts, though 
these could result in letters overlapping.
There is no specific property for kerning, but you could set 
up a rule using a class selector, for example:
.kerning { letter-spacing: -0.1em; }
4.12 Barcelona-based Días Contados, a 
company translating books into Castilian 
Spanish and Catalan, uses centred text 
on its home page and on inside pages 	 	
to great effect
4.13 Kerning is used to fine-tune the visual spacing between pairs of letters, achieved 
in CSS by using negative letter-spacing
4.14 Letter spacing and word spacing can be achieved in CSS but should be used 
sparingly – in headings for example
And then use a <span> tag to enclose the pair of letters you 
wish to adjust, as in this h2 heading:
<h2><span class="kerning">Yo</span>! World.</h2>
The same could be done to the W and o in ‘World’.
The property word-space adds space between words. 
Normally any string of spaces in HTML code will be ignored 
and collapsed down to one, but the property white-space 
preserves them – probably only ever useful for the layout of poetry.

Text (and other elements) can also be aligned vertically, 
relative to the baseline, for example, to produce subscripts 
(H²0) and superscripts (E=mc²):
.superscript { font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:sup; } 
.subscript { font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:sub; } 
Or you can also use the HTML tags <sup> and <sub>
E=MC<sup>2</sup>
A revival from medieval manuscripts is the drop cap  
(Fig 4.17): an initial letter signalling the beginning of the text. 
It is usually enlarged to a size equivalent to three or more lines 
of type, with the type adjacent to it indented to make room. 
Drop caps work best when the first word comprises a single 
letter, such as A or I. Failing that, avoid short words, especially 
ones with only two letters. And take care with those words that 
form different words when the initial letter is removed, such as 
‘T-he’ or ‘E-very’. The pseudo-element :first-letter is 
not really a CSS property but a selector that identifies which 
part of the text CSS should apply to. For example:
p:first-letter {
 font-weight: bold;
 color: red;
 font-size: xx-large;
}
will result in a big, bold drop cap at the beginning of every 
paragraph. It may be better to use a <span> class if you want 
only the very first letter of the whole page to be a drop cap.
There is another pseudo-element, :first-line, that 
styles the initial line of a paragraph, for example to make it small 
caps. The text-decoration property of none, underline, 
overline, line-through and blink is also probably best 
left alone. Its only real practical use is to remove the default 
underlining from a link.
And finally, we must not forget that our letters can be given 
colour at no extra cost. More on this in the next chapter.
Text alignment and spacing
A regular typewriter produces rows of type that line up on the 
left-hand side but give a ragged appearance on the right. In 
typesetting, this is called ranged left, flush left or ragged right. 
Type can also be set ranged right (ragged left); centred (Fig 
4.12); or asymmetrical. In books and magazines, it is usual to 
see columns of type with neat edges on both sides. This is 
called justified setting, and it is achieved by introducing variable 
amounts of space between the words. See Fig 4.15 for 
examples of each of these variations. More often than not, 
especially with the narrow columns used in newspapers and 
magazines, it is not possible to justify a line just by increasing the 
spaces, so words must be hyphenated. Compositors were 
taught to break words according to certain rules, but rules for 
hyphenation are now programmed into computer systems. 
In CSS, text-align will adjust the horizontal alignment 
of text. Its values are left, right, center and justify. 	
A better way to align elements is through manipulating their left 
and right margins (see Chapter 3). 
p { text-align: center; }
A widow is the final single word of a paragraph that is 
carried over to the top of a column, while an orphan is a single 
word, or few words, left on the last line at the end of a paragraph. 
Widows and orphans are best avoided, generally by asking the 
writer to delete a word or two from earlier in the paragraph.
We are now used to paragraphs on the web being full-width 
throughout with a horizontal space (line space) separating each 
paragraph. In books, however, the paragraphs may be flush 
with each other, a new paragraph being identified by the first 
line being indented. This can be replicated in CSS with an indent 
of blank space (Fig 4.16). 
p { text-indent: 3em }
Note that a negative value will produce an overhang, 
which could disappear off the screen in some browsers unless 
left padding is used to compensate. The space between 
paragraphs is adjusted using margin-top and margin-
bottom properties (see Chapter 3). Because different 
browsers have different defaults for the margins of headlines 
and blocks of text it is best to ‘zero-out’ all margins at the 
beginning of the style sheet:

Text and typography
4.15 Text set ranged left, ranged right, 
centred and justified. In CSS, this is 
achieved with the text-align property
4.16 If you want the first line of a 
paragraph to indent, use the CSS  
text-indent property. A negative 
value will result in an overhang
4.17 Drop caps emphasize the first letter 
of a page or article. To the right is a cap 
equivalent to two lines of type standing 
proud; below is a three-line cap with text 
flowing around it

Step-by-step 3
A basic portfolio website
Step 1.
First prepare your images using Photoshop. 
For each image, we will require a thumbnail. 
As the images in this example can be either 
portrait or landscape, we will opt for square 
thumbnails 180 x 180px, which will entail 
some cropping. For aesthetic reasons, make 
all the large versions the same width, e.g. 
550px. An easy way to create thumbnails is 
to reduce the shortest dimension (the width 	
if the image is portrait; the height if it is 
landscape) to 180px, then use Photoshop’s 
rectangular marquee tool, set at fixed size, to 
make your selection, then Image>Crop and 
File>Save for Web & Devices. Give your 
images meaningful names, with no spaces, 
and all lower case. It is good practice when 
naming thumbnails to add -t to the end of 
the filename, for example littlehampton.jpg 
for the large version; littlehampton-t.jpg for 
the thumbnail.
Step 2.
Open the index.html page from Step-by-
step 2, use ‘Save as’ to create portfolio.html, 
and delete the content from the right 
column. We will create an array of thumbnails 
in three rows of three to fit neatly on the 
page. Each thumbnail will have its own 
caption, and so that the caption will be 
positioned immediately under the thumbnail, 
we must create an image/caption combo 
<div>. And because there should only 		
be one instance of a main #<div> ID per 	
page and there will be many thumbnails 		
on the page, we define it as a class, called 
.thumbnail:
.thumbnail {
 float: left;
 width: 180px;
 margin: 10px 30px 0px 0px;
}
and another class for the smaller caption 
text, thus:
.thumbnail p {
text-align: center;
font-size: .9em; 
}
The HTML will look like:
<div class="thumbnail">
<a href="littlehampton.
html"><img src="images/
littlehampton-t.jpg" 
width="180" height="180" 
border="0" alt="The East Beach 
Cafe, Littlehampton"></a>
<p>The East Beach Cafe, 
Littlehampton</p>
</div>
If you think the captions will be of differing 
lengths, it may be prudent to add a height 
to .thumbnail so they will all align neatly.
Step 3.
To make the new page littlehampton.html 
open in its own window, leaving portfolio.
html still available, add target="_
blank" to the <a> tag. The margins (top, 
right, bottom, left) defined in .thumbnail 
will keep the thumbnails spaced apart, 
and if we want to start another row after, 
say, the third thumbnail, we should add 		
a clear:
 
.clearboth { clear: both; }
adding to the HTML
<br class="clearboth" />
Carry on adding thumbnails in rows of 
three, until all nine are in place (top).
Step 4.
To create the page for the large image, 
open index.html again and ‘Save as’ 
littlehampton.html (you could name these 
pages gallery1.html, gallery2.html and so 
on if you prefer, or if you have a large 
portfolio). Replace the content with the 
larger image and its caption, leaving the 
copyright notice in place (middle). Repeat 
the process, making a new page for each 
of the photographs. You could also add a 
‘Back’ button to these pages to take the 
viewer back to the main thumbnail page, 
or buttons taking them on to the next 
image. So that the links in the main content 
do not inherit the look of the menu, all the 
original <a> tags are made specific to the 
#leftcolumn, thus:
#leftcolumn a:link {
 color: #639194;
 font-size: 1.2em;
 text-decoration: none;
 font-weight: bold;
}
and so on. And new links are made for the 
#rightcolumn.

Step 5.
Back on the portfolio page, you will notice 
that the copyright line does not look quite 
right, so we create another <div> called 
#footer and float it right. You could 
enclose the entire gallery of portfolio <div>s 
in yet another <div> called #gallery 		
to position it on the page and keep it all 
together as a module:
 
  #gallery {
 display: block;
 text-align: center;
 margin-left: 50px; 
}
It may also be useful to add an instruction 
line so that viewers will know to click the 
thumbnail to reveal a larger version 
(opposite below). If you have more photos, 
simply make a page called portfolio2.html, 
and link to it from the page we just made. 
The HTML in PageSpinner is shown right 
and the CSS below right.
Step 6.
There are many other ways to design a 
portfolio site, and you can adjust the CSS 	
to your heart’s content until it is finally all 
working and can be uploaded to your host 
for the world to see. 
Text and typography
Whether you are a designer, an artist, an illustrator or a 
photographer, you will need a portfolio, or gallery, site to 
showcase your work to potential clients. The most basic of 
these has an array of thumbnails, each of which with a click 	
of the mouse takes you to a larger version, with either a 
pop-up window, or as here, a new HTML page. This tutorial 
builds on the website created in Step-by-step 2 (pages 76–79), 
so we will not be making many changes to the colour scheme 
or type formatting.

Trailblazer 3
Grïngo
Brazilian design studio Grïngo was founded in 2006 by 
childhood friends, and now partners, from São Paulo: André 
Matarazzo (taking on the strategic thinking and creative side) 
and Fernanda Jesus (who looks after client relations). After 
studying hotel management, which he believed would yield 
adventures around the world, Matarazzo abandoned the 
hospitality sector in 1997 to join McCann-Erickson in São Paulo 
to work on a new form of advertising, just nascent in Brazil, 
called ‘digital’. He’d always been a very visual person, and 
loved graphic design before he knew what it really represented. 
He also loved computers: join the two passions together and 
you have digital design. He designed his first website in 1996 
– a small project for a vending machine business his father ran, 
based on a Microsoft FrontPage template. Matarazzo describes 
it now as ‘hideous’. 
After three years as art director at web-design company 
Blast Radius, Vancouver, and another two at Blast Radius, 
Amsterdam, plus almost two years as Creative Director at 
Farfar, Stockholm, and a quick dab at TYO-ID, Tokyo, Matarazzo 
became homesick. With the experience gained at these 
international agencies he moved back to Brazil to start Grïngo. 
Jesus followed a more conventional route, taking an MBA at 
the University of São Paulo.
Grïngo has grown over the years from production to a 
full-service digital strategy and creative agency that employs 
over 60 staff and freelancers with offices in São Paulo and Rio 
de Janeiro, juggling 20 to 30 projects at any time. It holds 
several multinational accounts, including Coca-Cola, Windows 
Live, Absolut Vodka, Levi’s and São Paulo FC. In the past three 
years Grïngo has won three Cyber Lions at The Cannes Lions 
International Advertising Festival: in 2007 a Bronze for Still Alive 
(creative and production); in 2007 a Bronze for Africa Auditorium 
(creative and production) and in 2008 a Silver for Grïngo’s 
Swear Words Dictionary. At the time of writing they had also 
achieved 23 FWA (Favourite Website Awards) website of the 
day awards, a silver from the One Show Interactive and 14 
accolades from the Wave Festival (Festival Latino-Americano 
de Communicação).
Grïngo, according to Matarazzo, has evolved from a focus 
on impactful mini-sites, usually some form of advertainment, 	
to become a creative agency that is digital-centric, but media 
agnostic. They believe that the centre of all communication 
must be digital, the top medium for engagement and effective 
exchange and learning. Advertising, he says, is no longer 
merely about communicating a message, but participating in 
and bettering people’s lives. Despite their ‘chilled boyish good 
looks’, they do research, analysis, strategy, concept creation, 
production, media buy and business intelligence – and actually 
find it fun.
A Grïngo is ‘a foreigner’ in Brazilian Portuguese. Matarazzo 
insists it’s not pejorative. ‘I guess the name Grïngo personifies 
our work methodology and structure. I’ve taken a few of the 
best practices I’ve seen while working around the world: 
extreme care for poetry and design from Japan; the nonsense 
humour and horizontal working processes of Sweden; the total 
professionalism and metrics of success and how to conduct 
business I found in Canada, and so on. I guess Grïngo is a little 
of all this.’
Like many web designers, he is largely self-taught. He 
says: ‘I think going to a great design school must be fantastic 
but you can certainly do without if you dedicate yourself 
enough to reading what’s available, looking for your references 
online, chatting to good people, becoming an intern at a good 
studio. And let’s face it, some people just have the gift and 
others spend years attending a good school but pump out 
mediocre work. I think about 70 per cent of our designers 
never went to design school. I am very excited about folks 
coming out of Hyper Island (an industry-based learning 
programme based in Sweden) and their knowledge of projects 
and hands-on experimentation. I guess in some decades the 
business will be more mature and we can just pull from a great 
school someone who already knows a lot. Right now I find 
almost everyone needs to be taught the basics again when they 
come to Grïngo.’ 
While many of Grïngo’s websites are Flash-based, Matarazzo 
is not a Flash programmer – he has a team of specialists to 	
do that. And he is confident of Flash’s future: ‘I imagine it will 
continue developing fast and adding many functionalities 
out-of-the-box.’ But it should be used appropriately: ‘When 	
I check my webmail, please give me something simple and 
clean. When I want to kill some time and get entertained, 
please give me an awesome site with amazing graphics and 	
a storyline that intrigues me.’ But, ‘I am tired of the extra 
baroque stuff. Just don’t make me think too hard, it gets in 	
the way of beauty. Disruptive is fine, it makes you laugh and 
you may send it to a friend, but then what? I am interested 	
in deeper engagement nowadays.’

Images and 
colour schemes
Graphic designers coming from a mainly print background will be used 
to working in CMYK colour. Cyan, magenta, yellow and black (key) are 
mixed to produce all the colours of the rainbow – at least in theory. In 
practice, CMYK is a compromise and has trouble reproducing many of 
the colours that we can see with our eyes. If the budget allows, you may 
be able to add an extra Pantone spot colour, or use six-colour ‘hifi’ that 
adds orange and green inks to increase the colour gamut. 
The good news for designers of websites is that they get to work with 
RGB (red, green, blue) colour, which has a bigger gamut than the above. 
Not only that, but using a resolution of 72dpi, rather than the print norm 
of 300dpi, means smaller, more manageable files. But before we discuss 
colour in greater detail, let’s look at images and graphic formats.
5.1 Newsmap uses colour coding to 
overview the constantly changing shape 	
of Google News. It groups news stories 
with similar content and places them into 
clusters, the size of each cell determined 
by the amount of related articles. It also 
allows you to compare the emphasis given 
to news in different countries

Chapter 5
can display 24-bit colour. Photoshop has a ‘Save for Web & 
Devices’ feature (Fig 5.3) that does wonders to compress JPEG 
and GIF images, trading off file size against image quality. Too 
much compression can result in unwanted visual ‘artefacts’ 
appearing along contrasty edges, such as around text and 
where the sky meets a face or tree. JPEGs also suffer from 
generation loss – the more they are edited and copied, the 
worse they can look (Fig 5.2).
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless, portable 
format that provides a patent-free replacement for GIFs and 
print-based TIFFs (Tagged Image File Format). It can work 	
with indexed colour, like GIFs, or with RGB. PNG is a better 
choice than JPEG for storing images containing text, line art or 
sharp transitions, although it will have a larger file size. Another 
advantage of using a PNG is that it has a wider range of 
transparency options than a GIF. Either a single pixel value can 
be declared as transparent or an alpha channel can be added 
(enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used). 
Older browsers do not support PNGs, but as they are phased 
out, it will become a more widespread format.
	
Thumbnails made simple
	
If you are making a portfolio or gallery page (see Step-by-step 3), you 	
	
will need to prepare thumbnails (small versions of images). These will 	
	
often be a different shape from the bigger image, e.g. square, so some 	
	
creative cropping is usually necessary to select the most important 	
	
portion of the image. In Photoshop, first reduce the shortest dimension 	
	
to the size of the thumbnail, e.g. 180px, then use Photoshop’s 	
	
rectangular marquee tool, set at ‘fixed size’ (180 x 180px) to make your 	
	
selection, then Image>Crop and File>Save for Web & Devices. Give your 	
	
images meaningful names, no spaces, all lower case. It is good practice 	
	
when naming the thumbnails to add a -t to the end of the filename, 	
	
for example ‘big-image.jpg’ for the large version, ‘big-image-t.jpg’ for 	
	
the thumbnail.
As we learned in Chapter 2, images are added to the HTML 
using the code:
<img src="jane-doe.jpg" width="250" height="280" border="0" 
alt="Self-portrait">
The abbreviation src stands for ‘source’ and tells the browser 
the location of the image, in this case the root folder (the same 
one as the HTML pages); alt stands for ‘alternative text’, 
necessary for browsers that do not display images and for 
screen-reading devices. Adding the dimensions of the image 
means that the browser will make space for the picture before 
it loads. If missed out, the page content and layout will jump 
about as various images are loaded. Because the <img> tag 
is one of those few exceptions that does not come in pairs, to 
comply with strict XHTML, we need to add a space and slash 
to the end:
<img src="jane-doe.jpg" width="250" height="280" border="0" 
alt="Self-portrait" />
It is always good practice to put all the images into a separate 
subfolder, here called images, which would make the code:
<img src="images/jane-doe.jpg" width="250" height="280" 
border="0" alt="Self-portrait" />
Always ensure that the structure of the website on the server is 
identical to the structure on your computer or else the browser 
will not be able to locate the images.
Images should be first prepared in a program such as 
Photoshop, to crop them to the right size and resolution. 
Generally, images with areas of flat colour, such as logos and 
buttons, are best saved as GIFs, and continuous-tone 
photographic-type images as JPEGs. The GIF (Graphics 
Interchange Format) was originally developed for CompuServe 
(it is still called CompuServe GIF on the Photoshop menu). It 
can only handle a palette of 256 colours, also known as 8-bit 
indexed colour. A later version, called GIF89a, also supports 
transparency (so that images with irregular outlines can appear 
to blend into the background), and interlacing, so that the 
image first appears as a pixellated picture that gradually sharpens 
up as it downloads. GIF89a also allows animated GIFs to be

#008080, red #ff0000 and lime #00ff00. CSS 2.1 has added 
orange #ffa500 to the list. There is also a more extensive, but 
non-standard list of colours called X11 supported by many 
browsers, but these are not recommended. These include 
such exotic names as Blanched Almond (#ffebcd), Chocolate 
(#d2691e), Dodger Blue (#1e90ff), Old Lace (#fdf5e6) and 
Tomato (#ff6347). 
In addition, CSS allows for colours to be defined by RGB 
value (in decimal numbers or percentage), for example, a <p> 
tag can be coloured red in any of the following ways:
p { color: red; }
p { color: #ff0000; }
p { color: #f00; }
p { color: rgb(255,0,0); }
p { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%); }
Colours can also be defined by HSL (hue, saturation and 
lightness) values (see below). In addition
p { color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); }
also produces red. These colours can be used to define text 
and backgrounds. 
But which colours to choose? Which colours best go with 
other colours? We will discuss colour schemes, but first a little 
colour theory.
Colour
Website designers get to work in RGB all the time, and at 
screen resolution of 72dpi (dots per inch), so what they see on 
the screen will be the same as in the finished product. There 
are slight differences, however, in the way Macs and PCs display 
colours, and how different browsers parse the colour information. 
Most people are assumed to have at least a 256-colour 
monitor, and taking into account the above constraints, we 
arrive at 216 ‘web-safe’ colours, which will be displayed 
without resorting to dithering (optically mixing two or more 
colours). As computers have improved, this is not such a big 
issue as it used to be, but as new devices come on to the 
market, such as mobile phones and netbooks, it may still be 
worth bearing in mind. Charts of web-safe colours can be 
found on the internet, for example www.lynda.com/hex.html.
Hexadecimal numbering
Web colours are generally described using a six-digit number 
comprising three sets of hexadecimal (hex) numbers, one each 
for the red, green and blue components of the colour. Hexa-
decimal numbers (numbers to base 16) are, as mentioned in 
Chapter 4, a legacy from computer science and are used 
because they directly translate to binary, the number system 
(base 2, i.e. just 0s and 1s) that computers use internally. 
Each hex component ranges from 00 to ff, equivalent to  
0 to 255 in decimal notation: 00 (0 in decimal) represents the 
lowest intensity; ff (255), the highest intensity of each of the 
colour components. This results in 16 million possible colours. 
So, 000000 is the complete absence of colour – i.e. black – 
and ffffff is the most intense colour, white. An intermediate 
colour, for example, with components: red = 50, green = 100, 
blue = 10 in decimal will convert to the hex 32 64 0a – note 
that a leading zero is added to the third number to make it up 
to six digits in all. These are then concatenated to #32640a 
and the hash mark added. A program such as Photoshop  
will take care of the conversions automatically, but there  
are also online calculators available, for example <www.
telacommunications.com/nutshell/rgbform.htm>. Web-safe 
colours only use hex values of double numbers, 6699ff, for 
example, which as a shortcut can be shortened to just three 
digits: 69f.
Some web creators prefer to specify colours by name 
rather than by hexadecimal value, but as the specifications  
are constantly being updated, it’s best to stick with the hex 
equivalents. There are 16 standard colours in HTML 4.01 with 
names that are recognized by all browsers. They include teal

Colour theory 
Transmitted colour (Fig 5.7) is light that comes direct 
from an energy source, or shining through coloured filters in 
the theatre or displayed on a computer screen. The primary 
colours of light are red, green and blue (RGB), and other 
colours are made by combining different intensities of these 
three colours.
Pigment colours (Fig 5.8) are created because the materials 
in pigments and dyes absorb different wavelengths of light, 
and reflect or re-transmit others. We say that colour is a 
property of light, not of the material itself, although the 
molecular structure of an object does affect the way some 
wavelengths of light are absorbed and others re-transmitted. 
Green grass absorbs (subtracts) all the colours except green, 
so that is how we see it. With pigment, the colour produced 
depends on the characteristics of that particular pigment: that 
is why there are so many colours available in art stores – it is 
usually impossible to achieve the same vibrant orange or green 
of a pigment of that colour by mixing the primary colours of 
pigments (red, yellow and blue).
In transmitted light (including computer screens), the three 
primary colours are red, green and blue. In colours reflected 
from pigments, the three primary colours are red, yellow and 
blue. Mix any two, and you have the secondary colours: orange, 
green and purple for pigments; cyan, yellow and magenta for 
transmitted colours – colours that designers for print know 
well. Here we are more interested in how colours interact in 
colour schemes. No matter how they were created, placing 	
red next to green, say, will have the same effect on the brain 
whether seen on screen or on the printed page. We know from 
colour psychology that the brain accepts four colours – red, 
yellow, green and blue – as primaries, and this is reflected in 
the composition of modern colour wheels (Fig 5.6). 
Our eyes can detect visible light from violet, with a 
wavelength of around 400 nanometres, to red, at about 700 
nanometres. Isaac Newton (1643–1727) discovered that by 
refracting white light through a prism it breaks down into the 
visible spectrum, which the human eye perceives as a smoothly 
varying rainbow.

Chapter 5
colour is any mixture of a primary with a secondary neighbour, 
for example yellow-green. An equilateral triangle with vertices 
at the primaries is called the primary triad (see Fig 5.16). Similar 
triads can join up the secondaries and tertiaries. 
Saturation, also known as intensity or chroma, is the 
strength or purity of a colour. A saturated colour is bright and 
intense, almost a pure hue, whereas a desaturated colour has 
no hue and is called achromatic. Shocking pink and rose are 
two saturations of the hue red (Fig 5.9). Different saturations 
can be achieved by mixing a pure hue with a neutral grey or 
with its complementary colour. The complementary colour of 
red, for example, is green. A tone is a low-intensity colour 
produced by mixing a hue with a shade of grey.
Brightness, also known as luminance or value, is the relative 
lightness or darkness of a colour. Zero brightness is black and 
100% is white, intermediate values are light or dark colours. 	
A shade is a dark colour made by mixing a hue with black. A 	
tint is a light colour made by mixing a hue with white (Fig 5.10). 
In 1872, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell 
Light colour is inherently additive; pigment colour is 
inherently subtractive. A colour display on a monitor starts out 
black, and light is added to the screen to create colour. The 
more of the primary colours red, green and blue are added, the 
brighter and lighter the screen becomes. At 100% intensity of 
red, green and blue, the screen is white. 
Regardless of the physics of how colour is created, whether 
it is transmitted or reflected light, most designers and illustrators 
will use colour on screen as if it were paint, i.e. pigment. It 	
thus makes more sense to talk about red and green being 
complementary colours than red and cyan. The relationships 
between colours that you see on screen are exactly the same 
as what you see in print. The primary colours of pigments are 
red, yellow and blue. The secondary colours are made from a 
mixture of two primaries: red and yellow make orange; red and 
blue make purple; yellow and blue make green. The tertiary 
colours are made from a mixture of two secondaries, or two 
complementary colours, such as red and green. Examples are 
olive green, maroon, and various browns. An intermediate

(1831–1879) developed a colour chart, in the form of a triangle, 
from his studies of the electromagnetic theory of light. Newton 
had said that the seven basic colours made visible by a prism 
were elementary and unmixable; Maxwell proved that only three 
colours – red, green and blue – were necessary to create all 
the others. His work became the basis for colour photography, 
colour printing and computer screens.
The simplest way of arranging colours is in a colour wheel 
or triangle, the most familiar being the 12-step colour wheel of 
Johannes Itten (1888–1967), a teacher at the Bauhaus school 
in Germany (see Fig 5.6). A colour wheel such as this shows 
only the hues, however. To show darker and lighter colours, 	
we need a 3D colour space, the best known of which is the 
tree, developed by the American painter Albert Henry Munsell 
(1858–1918) in which the ‘trunk’ goes from black (0) to white 
(10) and the branches radiate out with the neutrals next to the 
trunk and the brightest colours at the extremities (Fig 5.11).
In 1931, a world standard for measuring colour was 
established by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage 
(CIE) known as the CIE chromaticity chart, a 1976 version of 
which – the L*a*b model – is used to measure and quantify the 
colours produced by computer screens (Fig 5.12). L stands for 
luminance; a and b are chromatic components covering the 
four primaries – a is for green to red, and b for blue to yellow. 
Programs such as Adobe Photoshop use the L*a*b model 
internally when converting from RGB to CMYK. Although RGB 
has a bigger gamut than CMYK (Fig 5.13) it can still display only 
around 70% of the colours that can be perceived by the human 
eye; CMYK can manage only about 20% of all possible colours.
5.13 The gamuts of RGB and CMYK can 
be mapped onto a CIE sail to show what  
colours can be reproduced. RGB can 
display only 70% of the colours that can be 
perceived by the human eye; CMYK only 
about 20% of all colours
5.12 The CEI chromaticity sail has hues 
around the edge with white near the 
middle – it defines the gamut of the visible 
spectrum. The L*a*b colour model is 
based on this colour map

Chapter 5
Colour theorists are interested not only in classifying colour, but 
also in how colours work with each other. Colour schemes have 
connotations of interior design – matching the colour of the walls 
with woodwork and furnishings – but also have a place in web 
design. They are like music, with colours as notes working with 
or against each other to form harmonies and chords – or jarring 
discords. Many such schemes were devised by Johannes Itten 
and his pupil Josef Albers (1888–1976). We use Itten’s 12-step 
colour wheel here for simplicity (see page 115); regardless of 
whether colours are pigments or light they produce the same 
psychological response when placed close to each other.
An achromatic colour scheme comprises black, white and 
the greys in between; there are no possible colour contrasts. 
Black with white provides the strongest contrast available. A 
chromatic grey or neutral relief colour scheme means just dull 
colours, sometimes with a hint of brightness. Colours near the 
centre of a 3D colour wheel such as the Munsell tree (Fig 5.11) 
are neutral, and this scheme will be harmonious since strong 
hue contrasts are not possible.
Colour schemes
The monochromatic colour scheme is the next simplest 
type, consisting of one hue and its various brightnesses, and 
sometimes variations in saturation. It looks clean and elegant, 
producing a soothing effect, especially with cool blue or green 
hues. The analogous colour scheme (Fig 5.14) is based on a 
pie-shaped slice of three or more hues located next to each 
other on the colour wheel, usually with one hue in common: 
yellow-orange, yellow and yellow-green, for example. They are 
at their most harmonious when the middle colour is a primary. 
These subtle schemes dominate the web at present.
A complementary colour scheme (Figs 5.15, 5.18) is built 
around two hues that are opposite one another on the colour 
wheel. This scheme is high-contrast and intense, to the point 
of creating vibrating colours, and so is not recommended for 
text on a background colour. A double complementary scheme 
uses two sets of complementaries, and if they come from 
equidistant places on the wheel, this is termed a quadrad.  
This scheme is hard to harmonize; if all four hues are used in 
equal amounts, the scheme may look unbalanced. A split 
5.14 An analogous colour scheme 	
uses colours close to one another  
on the colour wheel
5.15 A complementary colour scheme 
uses colours opposite one another on  
the colour wheel; a split complementary 
scheme used a colour one step along 
from the complementary (dotted line)

119
Images and colour schemes
5.16 A triadic scheme uses three colours 
equally spaced on the colour wheel, such 
as the three primaries; a quadrad colour 
scheme uses four colours at the corners 
of a square placed on the colour wheel
complementary colour scheme comprises any hue plus the two 
colours either side of its complementary. Contrast is less marked 
than with a pure complementary scheme, but more intense 
than the double complementary, and much more interesting.
A triad colour scheme is any set of three hues that are 
equidistant on the colour wheel, forming the vertices of an 
equilateral triangle (Fig 5.16). A primary triad provides the liveliest 
set of colours (Fig 5.19); a secondary triad is softer, because, 
while the interval between the hues is the same, any two 
secondaries will be related, sharing a common primary: orange 
and green, for example, both contain yellow. A scheme based 
on the rectangle is called a quadrad, which could also be a 
double complementary. A tetrad is also based on a square, but 
comprises a primary, its complement, and a complementary 
pair of tertiaries.
A neutral colour scheme includes colours not found on the 
colour wheel, such as beige, brown, white, black and grey. An 
accented neutral colour scheme is mainly neutral colours plus 
highlights of a brighter colour such as red.
Choosing a scheme
Choosing a colour scheme is a highly subjective process. Your 
clients may have colours they prefer, in their logos or corporate 
identity branding for example, so you may be constrained and 
guided by these. You may want to use colours sampled from 
an image on your home page.
You should be clear about your site’s brand message and 
choose colours that reinforce it. For a financial institution, for 
example, use cool, muted colours such as blues, greys and 
greens, which convey stability and trust. On the other hand, a 
site aimed at a younger audience could make use of brighter, 
brasher, more saturated colours. Don’t overdo the number of 
colours in your palette: three or four colours, plus white and 
black, should be enough. Too many colours can distract and 
confuse the user.
Black text on a white background provides the highest degree 
of contrast, but a white background may be seen as cold and 
clinical and black text too boring. Try more subtle shades, as

and Vietnam wedding dresses are red, their traditional colour 
of good luck and happiness, although this is changing. In Jan 
van Eyck’s 1434 Arnolfini double portrait, the woman’s 
wedding dress is green, symbolizing hope that she may soon 
become a mother. In the west, people wear black to funerals, 
but in many south and east Asian cultures, white is symbolic of 
death. Green used to be associated with poison, but is now 
more positively associated with ecology and saving the planet.
Once your colour scheme is decided, write down the 
colours so you can refer to them later and allocate them to areas 
of your website, to headings and text, and build them into the 
CSS. If you don’t like what you see in the browser, they can 
always be fine-tuned later without affecting the HTML pages. In 
the next chapter we look at all the add-ons, bells and whistles 
that can bring your website alive.
you would when painting a room – say, off-white for the walls 
and dark greys for the details. To test for contrast and legibility, 
convert your colour scheme to greyscale: can it still be read? 
Fig 5.17 is a good example of a website that uses subtle shades 
and is still very legible. Be aware that colour trends can quickly 
go out of fashion – but you can use retro colour palettes to 
evoke feelings of nostalgia.
The art of using one of these colour schemes is to vary  
the proportions of the colours, rather than distributing them in 
equal measures. A designer can never be tied to a rigid set of 
colours, but taking a colour scheme based on a dominant hue 
as a starting point and adapting it will result in a composition 
with a degree of ‘tonality’. Various colour-scheme planners can 
be found on the web, such as http://kuler.adobe.com, http://
www.colourspire.com/ and http://ColourSchemeDesigner.com/. 
If you start with a particular colour, perhaps one in the client’s 
logo, these planners will suggest harmonious and/or contrasting 
colours for you to incorporate into your scheme. The last 
website listed also shows how a particular colour scheme will 
look to a person with colour blindness.
Additional considerations
Around one person in twelve has some sort of colour 
deficiency: 8% of men and 0.4% of women in the United States 
suffer from it. Deuteranomaly is the most common colour 
deficiency, occurring in about 6% of American men. This results 
in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. 
For example, in the evening, green cars can appear to be 
black, although the intensity of the colour is unchanged. At 
worst a colour-blind person may see only shades of grey. It is 
important therefore to consider adding contrast to your colour 
schemes. Almost all colour-blind people retain some blue-
yellow discrimination, even if they mix up red and green.
Architects and designers use colour psychology to modify 
our behaviour. Fast-food restaurants are painted orange or pink 
to induce excitement. They excite you to come in, eat quickly, 
then vacate the table for the next set of excited customers. Pink 
can be energizing or calming. Prisons are often painted pink to 
cheer up those who work there and subdue the inmates. Blue 
is rarely used in restaurants, because it is a relaxing colour – the 
customers won’t want to leave. Hospitals used to be painted 
pale green to soothe patients. 
Remember too that colours can have multiple cultural 
connotations and both positive and negative associations. White 
in western countries is the colour of weddings; in China, India

Developing a website using background 
colours and faux columns

 width: 100%;
}
Step 1.
These two-column CSS layouts from 
www.code-sucks.com (from a method 
developed by Dan Cederholm) use a neat 
trick to make the left and right columns 
look equal in height and independent of 
each other. A parent column called faux is 
created and a long thin GIF, the width of 
the website, at 922px wide and 22px high, 
is created that contains both the left and 
right child columns as different-coloured 
Step 2.
A header banner is made in Photoshop at 
922px x 122px and added as a 
background image to the CSS (below) 
rather than to the HTML, so that it can 
always be changed in future without 
having to change all the pages.  
In addition, some text is added to the 
HTML page so it now appears as shown 
here (bottom right).
#header {

 padding: 0px;
 height: 110px;
 margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;

background image that grows as content 
is added (below). Note the fix to allow 
older browsers such as Internet Explorer

Faux Column CSS Layouts
These 2 Column Faux CSS Layouts use a background image to make it look like the left and right columns are equal
in height and independent of each other.
Things couldn't be futther from the truth. I created a parent column called faux and vertically tiled the image, that
contained both the left and right child columns. I then vertically tiled the faux background image and viola.
I first found about this method from the alistapart site by a guy called Dan Cederholm

One problem that can occur when using the CSS box model 
of layout is that the height of a column is determined by the 
amount of content contained in it. Thus, a menu column, say, 
would appear shorter than the main body that contains lots of 
text and images. One way to get round this (used in Step-by-
step 3 on pages 102–5) is to add an equal height property to 
both columns, but the layout could still break down if the 
content you add exceeds the fixed height of the container. The 
faux column method creates invisible (unequal) column 
containers while a background GIF, which tiles automatically 
downwards as the content increases, gives the impression of 
neat and tidy columns.
Images and colour schemes
Step 3.
Next the text is styled to a sans serif font 
and the Owen Briggs method (see tip on 
page 95) is applied to the type size. 
Leading is added by adjusting the <line-
height> property and space between the 
paragraphs and headings increased by 
adding space to the bottom padding.
The image is added and you can see how 
the background GIF tiles to accommodate 
the content and give the impression that 
the columns are increasing in height 
equally (right).
body {
 font-family: Verdana,  
 Helvetica, Arial,  
 sans-serif; 
 font-size: 80%;
}
p { 
 font-size: 1em;
 line-height: 1.25em;
 padding-bottom: 1.25em; 
}
h1 { 
 font-size: 2em;
 padding-bottom: 1.25em;
 text-align: center; 
}
h2 { font-size: 1.25em;
 padding-bottom: 1.25em;
 text-align: center; 
}
Step 4.
It’s now time to look at the menu, which 
will occupy the left column. Again, rather 
than reinvent the wheel we can use a 
tried-and-tested public-domain template 
from Listamatic – css.maxdesign.com.au/
listamatic – designed by Russ Weakley. 
This uses the unordered list tag <ul>. A 
div called #navcontainer is nested 
within the div #leftcolumn, with the 
menu items listed as per this code (right).
In the CSS, #navcontainer and 
#navlist are defined to style the <ul> 
tag and the <a> links. An unordered list 
has a bullet by default and this is removed 
using :
list-style-type: none;
and the default underlining removed from 
the links using:
text-decoration: none;
The colour scheme was set by the banner 
image – the blue-grey of a shadow under 
the trees was sampled and keyed into 
kuler.adobe.com and the other colours 
picked by eye from those suggested.  
<div id="navcontainer">
<ul id="navlist">
<li id="active"><a href="index.html" id="current">Home</a></li>
<li><a href="about.html">About me</a></li>
<li><a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></li>
<li><a href="blog.html">Blog</a></li>
<li><a href="links.html">Links</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
The text colour and links are still defaults 
but can be changed easily later – because 
we have used background images, the 
website is future-proof as we need only 
change the CSS, not the HTML pages.  
All that remains is to add a class called  
.caption that defines a smaller size for 
the caption text, and a ‘More photographs’ 
button, and that’s about it (below right).

The h1 heading ‘Portfolio’ has been 
further styled using a link to the Google 
font library by adding code (top) to the 
very top of the <head> section of the 
HTML, and (right) to the CSS.
The property text-shadow adds a drop 
shadow effect.
We need to add some description and 
keyword meta tags in the <head> for the 
search engines and then we can ‘save as’ 
the index.html page to create the other 
pages in the website. 
The finished HTML is shown in 
PageSpinner (right) and the CSS

the market and our curiosity entices us to explore new ways of 
developing and communicating. For example, right now we’re 
developing two iPhone applications, an iPad application and 
an HTML5/CSS3 site.’
Do they think there is a future for Flash, with Steve Jobs 
not supporting it on iPad? ‘Of course Flash still has a future! I 
understand Steve Jobs’s position. What he cares about most 
is wanting his devices to work perfectly. That’s why I find it 
normal that Adobe is optimizing its software and plug-ins to 
enhance the user’s experience as much as possible. Flash is 
everywhere on the internet. Apple can’t do without it, and 
neither can anybody else. I think Adobe and Apple are doing 
their utmost to let users quickly benefit from technology, 
allowing them to see everything on any kind of device.’ 
What do they think of CSS/XHTML? ‘I have the feeling  
that CSS/HTML seems like a novelty for the most part!’ says 
Laugel. ‘HTML has been around since 1991, HTML4 since 
1997, CSS since the late 90s. Today HTML5 makes it possible 
to fully enter the multimedia world. The idea isn’t just to wonder 
whether HTML5 is better than Flash but to adapt the technology 
to the message and the user’s experience. Why use Flash where 
we don’t need it? And why insist on developing in HTML/CSS 
when Flash takes one-tenth of the time for better quality?’
What do they think of integrating Web 2.0 (Twitter, Flickr, 
Facebook, blogs, etc.) into their websites? ‘There’s no way 
around it! Social platforms are springboards for brands and a 
highly effective way of spreading messages and creating 
communities. But they must be used well because, although 
the benefits might be exponential, employing those media 
poorly can quickly damage a brand and even cancel out its 
global communication. Those platforms have their own 
languages, habits and codes and it’s essential for brands to 
learn how to use them before becoming involved with them.’ 
How do they see the future of web design? ‘Mobile of 
course! Content is also a part of our future. Today users are 
browsing, commenting and creating content. It’s no longer 
enough to look beautiful, you also have to be effective, and 
effectiveness depends on creating original, exclusive content 
that web users will identify with.’
What are their favourite websites? ‘Nowadays I pay more 
attention to aggregators and apps,’ says Laugel. ‘I enjoy 
browsing ffffound.com and fubiz.net, taking my competitors’ 
temperature and feasting my eyes on thefwa.com, spying  
on Facebook, adding “underground” links on Twitter and 
publishing my pictures on Flickr and my videos on Vimeo.  
I dabble in everything and my clients love that!’
Benjamin Laugel (president and creative director of Soleil Noir) 
founded the Paris-based studio in 2000 with Olivier Marchand. 
After taking a masters degree in digital communication at 
ISCOM (Institut supérieur de communication et de publicité) in 
Paris, he started working at French cosmetic company Orlane. 
He soon realized that he preferred the packaging and its 
design to the product itself, so set up Soleil Noir, a ‘human-
sized studio’, to create mostly Flash-based immersive and 
interactive experiences for 50 or so global clients, including 
Disney Television, Nespresso, Samsung, EMI and Alfa Romeo. 
The studio employs 22 staff, and has received numerous 
prizes, among them 25 FWA Sites of the Day awards.
Laugel is European representative of SoDA (Society of 
Digital Agencies), Board Member of the Club des Directeurs 
Artistiques, and jury member of several international 
competitions. Olivier Marchand (vice president and production 
director) also studied at ISCOM, and graduated with a masters 
degree in digital communication. He created many sites as a 
freelancer while at college, before bringing his creativity and 
experience to Soleil Noir. 
Where did they learn web design? ‘Not in school, that’s for 
sure!’ says Laugel, ‘We really taught ourselves. I was already 
on the internet in 1995 with CompuServe, bulletin boards and 
IRC (Internet Relay Chat). They were different times but that’s 
where I learned how to use the web and, especially, to 
communicate with others online.
‘I’ve always been hooked on TV and animation, so using 
animation software (because that’s all there was then) such  
as Flash to reproduce what was already around me came 
naturally. Olivier and I were the first to create a French record 
label’s site (or any music-related site, for that matter), the 
hostile.fr site, in Flash. That was in 1999. I haven’t touched 
Flash in a while for the simple reason that it’s changed a lot 
and the people I work with are much more skilled than I am! 
But I try to keep up with the technology and the possibilities 
that the software we use offers.’
What has been their favourite project? ‘Mine was Myst IV 
Revelation’, says Laugel. ‘Everything came off so smoothly. We 
had so much content we didn’t know what to do with it, plus 
time, carte blanche when it came to creation and development 
… all that has changed so much. Our work is strategic, creative 
and extremely technical at the same time. Our collaborators 
are aware of these factors, which is why we manage to create 
magnificent interactive experiences with and for them.’ 
Do they always work in Flash? ‘Soleil Noir has very strong 
Flash expertise (we’ve been an Adobe Partner since 2008), but

library for the communication sector by 
French music publisher Red Tracks 
Publishing, Soleil Noir were asked to 
re-imagine how to present and search 
through the tracks, using an innovative 
concept and intuitive navigation. They 
created the search engine and visual 
identity for www.findyourtracks.fr, offering 
a new approach to exploring the library, 
using ambiances, targets and styles. This 
new type of navigation, together with the 
automatic display of results, made the 
search faster and more efficient, while also 
creating a user-friendly interface – music 
can be located in just a few simple clicks
Fig 5 When asked to create a website 	
for the launch of Samsung’s Player Star 
smartphone, highlighting its multi-touch 
functionalities in a new interactive way, 
Soleil Noir gave users the opportunity to 
imagine themselves in situations with the 
product. They conceived three messages 
and settings that were based on the 
innovative features of the phone, together 
with their interactive videos: ‘Share your 
emotions’, ‘Stay connected’ and ‘Tools 	
for your business’
Where do they find inspiration? ‘Teamwork,’ says Laugel. 
‘We brainstorm a lot with art directors, developers, motion 
designers, sound designers, etc. Everybody has ideas and the 
good ones don’t always come from the same people. We also 
keep an eye on other things. I love movie and TV credits that I 
find ultra creative. That’s where my ideas come from sometimes. 
We have people interested in other things besides the web and 
they offer us a wide variety of creative views. As I often say, 	
the expertise we’ve acquired lets us move beyond technology 
and technical issues, allowing us to fully focus on the idea 
and concept.’
What advice would you give someone at college wanting 
to be a web designer? ‘Be more interested in the web than 
students using it on a daily basis. I’ve noticed that most “young 
people” today don’t have web culture. Digital is starting to have 
a history and it’s important to know the references. I’d also tell 
them to express their ideas and release the interactive, conceptual 
originality in their heads. There are two things needed to create 
successful web design: user-friendliness and the graphics layout. 
They must be in osmosis and round each other off. 
‘The last point is, keep it simple. We’re swamped by graphics 
and messages. A simple approach helps to catch people’s 
attention better – above all focus on the navigation pathway 
and on making content look good. Always keep in mind that 
what you’re doing might be used by your parents, who will 
often question your work.’
How should web design beginners promote themselves? 
‘By using online folios like cargocollective.com, learning how 	
to use Twitter as a way to disseminate and share what you’re 
interested in, stressing simplicity, and being as original as you 
can. We get 10 to 15 CVs a day, and what we look at more 
than experience is how they are presented. Don’t forget that if 
content is paramount, the container is fundamental because 	
it makes the content look good! Last but not least, be daring! 
There are no set rules in our occupation, so always let your 
work and words be surprising!’

The great attraction of Web 2.0 applications such as Facebook, Flickr and 
Twitter is their interactivity. With a blog you can elicit comments; with a 
Facebook or Flickr special interest group you can share experiences or 
fire up heated debates; with Twitter, an idea can be published instantly, 
and rapidly disseminated. The traditional HTML/CSS websites that we 
have discussed so far can seem rather static – they only ever change when 
the designer decides to update them, so remember to update your website 
regularly with new content. These kinds of websites resemble traditional 
publishing: you put a book or magazine out into the wide world and the 
only feedback you can expect are the sales figures and maybe the odd 
review in a specialist journal.
Ways of enlivening your site range from adding an animated GIF or 
embedding content from Twitter, images from Flickr or news from a blog, 
to making your site dynamic with Flash or JavaScript. This takes us into 
another area altogether – into the world of programming, a thought that 
many designers may regard with horror. Most graphic designers will 
delegate this work to a programming professional (who might enjoy it). 
Some designers specialize only in Flash-based websites (Fig 6.1). Shopping 
sites such as Amazon and eBay have websites that are compiled ‘on the 
fly’ from a constantly updated database using a scripting language such 
as PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) or ASP (Active Server Pages) – you 
may have noticed the .php or .asp acronym at the end of a URL instead 
of .html. Programming is beyond the scope of this book, but we shall 
briefly look at each technology later.

Side Includes)
(but the SSI file remains as menu.html). You can, however, 
fool the server into thinking a .html file is a .shtml file using 
.htaccess – sites such as http://www.andreas.com/faq-ssi.
html tell you how.
Obviously it is best to develop an SSI site from scratch, 
but it is a relatively simple matter to convert a small site, and it 
only has to be done once. A disadvantage is that you cannot 
preview your website on your computer: it will only come together 
once uploaded by FTP to the server and viewed in a browser. 
Believe it or not, you have just done some programming.
We start with a technique that will not make your site look any 
different, but will make your job a great deal easier, particularly 
if the site is frequently being updated manually. Imagine that 
you have created a website with a large menu running down 
the left-hand column. The site now contains many hundreds of 
pages, but the client wishes to add another item to the menu, 
and remove one. What do you do? In the days of framesets, 
this was easy – you just amended the frame containing the 
menu and the whole website was updated. With an HTML/CSS 
website, however, you would have to make each change 
individually to each and every page. And what about the 
copyright notice at the bottom of the page in the footer? It says 
© 2011 at present, but what about when it’s 2012? Same 
problem. If you used a Dreamweaver template to design the 
site, you may have to make the change only once, but you 
would still have to upload all the revised pages to the server.
With SSI (Server Side Includes) you simply extract the block 
of menu code from your home page and place it into a new 
text document called menu.html – that is, a page stripped of 
the usual DOCTYPE, head and body HTML tags (it could also 
be called menu.txt). Back in the home page, and in all the 
others, you replace the menu code with the statement:
<!--#include file="menu.html"-->
when the included file is within the same directory folder as the 
page that wants it, otherwise:
<!--#include virtual="/includes/menu.html"-->
if the file is in a folder/directory called includes.
This calls in the code for the menu and fits it into the right 
place. As the term SSI implies, this is done at the server, so it 
is essential to check first that your server supports SSI – not all 
hosting services do. Check your ISP’s FAQ pages and search 
for htaccess (hypertext access). If this is not permitted, then 
you won’t be able to use SSI. 
Now if the menu needs to be changed, you simply update 
the menu.html text document and upload to the server and 
all the menus will update automatically. Any common piece 	
of text throughout the site that you think might be updated or 
changed at some point can be made into an SSI. To enable a 
web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file, it is usual 
to end the URL with .shtml, so that the home page, for 
example, would become index.shtml. You would also have 
to add the s to any internal links too, particularly in the menu 
6.2 Warp is an independent record label, 
founded in Sheffield in 1989, notable for  
electronic music. Their dynamic website 
almost certainly uses SSI, but it cannot be 
discerned just by looking at the source – 
on the server, all the changing content will 
have been called in

6.3 In the Layers palette of Photoshop, start 
with the first frame, duplicate the layer and 
then change the image incrementally – in 
this case changing the transparency of the 
text. Duplicate this new layer – and so on 
to create the number of steps you need

Animated GIFs
(the ‘chain’ icon at the bottom of the Animation palette). When 
you are happy with the order and time settings of the frames, 
go to ‘Save for Web & Devices’, and choose to save as a GIF. 
Because GIFs are better at flat colours than JPEGs, we will 
need quite a large indexed colour palette to reproduce all the 
subtle tones in the image, so be aware this will consequentially 
bump up the file size. The five frames used in the animation 	
are simulated in Fig 6.5. For an example of the successful use 
of animated GIFs see Figs 6.6 and 6.7.
	
Add a favicon
	
A favicon (short for favourites icon) is the tiny icon you sometimes see 	
	
when you add a web address to a bookmark list or see the URL in your 	
	
browser’s toolbar. They were introduced by Microsoft in Internet 	
	
Explorer 4 and are generally 16 x 16px. Having one can help make your 	
	
website memorable. A file called favicon.ico is placed in the root 	
	
directory of your website and accessed by code in the <head> section 	
	
of the HTML:
	
<link rel="icon" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon" 	
	
href="favicon.ico" />
	
The icon is best designed as a .png and then converted to .ico using a 	
	
Photoshop plug-in or a website generator such as www.genfavicon.com 	
	
or www.favicon.co.uk.
One thing that a GIF can do that a JPEG cannot is become 
animated. An animated GIF is the simplest form of animation;  
it is recognized by all browsers and rarely causes problems. 
Animated GIFs are usually encountered as banner advertisements 
and can be annoying. But a subtle piece of animation can add 
interest to an otherwise lifeless site. How does it work? The 
browser simply replaces one GIF after another into the same 
space on the page and the eye perceives it as a fluid 
movement, like a flip-book animation. There are various 
programs available to construct animated GIFs, such as GIF 
Construction Set Professional from Alchemy Mindworks, and 
Easy GIF Animator from Blumentals Software, but the most 
common method until recently was to use Adobe Photoshop 
with its co-worker ImageReady. However, with the release of 
Adobe’s Creative Suite 3 in 2007, ImageReady was officially 
retired and its functionality integrated into Photoshop.
In Photoshop, the first step is to load up all the separate 
images as layers, in order, with the first image in the animation 
preferably at the bottom. Or if you are creating the animation 
from scratch, start with the first frame, duplicate the layer and 
change the image incrementally, duplicate this new layer and so 
on (Fig 6.3). In this example we start with a background layer 
containing a photo of the sea plus a text layer containing the 
title of the website. We aim to create a simple fade-in from the 
background photo with no text, to text at 100% opacity (layer 1), 
in three stages: 25% (layer 4), 50% (layer 3) and 75% (layer 2).
In the Layers palette, uncheck the eye icons of all the 
layers except the one that you’d like to become the first frame 
of the sequence. In the Window menu, select Animation, and 
you should see your first layer loaded as the first frame in the 
animation window that appears. To set the time for each frame, 
click the bottom of frame 1 in the animation window: this will 
pop up a menu showing times in seconds. Next create a new 
frame using the button next to the Trash and select the layers 
you need from the layers palette: in this example that is the 
background plus layer 4, the 25% text. 
In the Layers palette, deselect the layer we just used for 
frame 1, by clicking on the eye, then select the next layer in the 
sequence for frame 2, in this case layer 3, the 50% text. This 
will put the contents of the second layer in the sequence into 
frame 2. And so on until we have five frames. We want our fade-in 
to happen once only, so change ‘forever’ to ‘once’, bottom 
left, otherwise it will loop indefinitely (Fig 6.4). 
You can test the animation by hitting the play button at any 
time, and the transitions between frames can be made even 
smoother by adding Tween frames, using the Tween button

Flash
Another plus point is that any fonts used in the Flash animation 
will reproduce on the user’s computer, whether they have them 
installed or not. It has become a favourite for graphic designers’ 
websites, and many designers use nothing else. 
ActionScript 3.0 is an object-oriented programming 
language, which means that chunks of code can be reused 	
to build quite complex Flash applications, including games. 
Because of Flash’s ubiquity, video sites on the web, such as 
YouTube and Google Video, use Flash to embed streaming 
video clips into their ‘players’. Websites often have an intro 
animation made using Flash, though these can be annoying 	
if you have to wait too long for them to load, and if they serve 
no real purpose can become an irritation to watch more than 
once – so always include a ‘skip intro’ button so that the user 
can jump straight to the website proper.
If you must use Flash – if you are a Flash animator showing 
your skills, for example – make sure you put keywords in the 
<meta> tags and also as plain text below the intro, install a 
‘mute’ button to turn off any music, provide a ‘loading bar’ 	
that indicates the time or percentage left for the Flash to load 
completely, and always provide a link to where the user can 
download the latest plug-in.
Despite upgrades, usability remains an issue. Flash does 
not behave in the same way as normal HTML pages: the ability 
to select text, scrolling, using forms and right-clicking are not 
the same as on a regular web page. Unexpected actions can 
confuse users and should be borne in mind by the designer. 
Recent improvements include the ability to control text size using 
full-page zoom, and to include alternative text.
Steve Jobs of Apple has openly criticized the stability of 
Flash, claiming that when a Macintosh crashes, ‘more often 
than not’ the cause is Flash. As a consequence, at the time of 
writing, Flash has not been supported on the iPhone or iPad.
Jobs is backing HTML5, the proposed next standard for 
HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0, which aims to replace proprietary 
plug-in-based rich internet application (RIA) technologies such 
as Flash, using new <audio> and <video> elements and 
APIs (application programming interfaces). YouTube and Vimeo 
are experimenting with HTML5 but, at the time of writing, there 
is still a long way to go.
One thing an animated GIF does not have is sound: for 
animations with music and sound effects, you need Flash. Back 
in the days before CSS, graphic designers would go to great 
lengths to make the web reproduce their typography and 
layouts; they would convert type into images and even construct 
entire websites using the multimedia program Adobe Director 
(formerly Macromedia Director). Visually these might have 
looked fine, but the trade-off was a near invisibility to the search 
engines and a snub to accessibility aids; they required the user 
to download Shockwave plug-ins, represented huge files and 
hence download time, and were notoriously difficult to print out. 
Flash too has suffered from these drawbacks, but has evolved 
to address them in recent years. Using Director or Flash also 
requires the developer – you – to purchase proprietary software.
Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash) began life as 
FutureSplash, launched in 1996 and based on a drawing 
application called SmartSketch. It started off as a vector-based 
web animation program, using some novel drawing and painting 
tools, based around key frames and a timeline (Fig 6.8). Animation 
is object-based, which means you can incorporate simple 
animations into more complex ones. It also means you have to 
be methodical: for example, to animate a walking person, first 
animate the legs on their own then reuse that ‘object’ in a whole 
person assemblage. Flash programming really requires a whole 
book of its own, so can only be outlined here.
Output file format is .swf (ShockWave Flash) and these 
movies can be ‘played’ in a standalone Flash Player or 
embedded into a web page using code such as:
<object width="500" height="400">
<param name="movie" value="flash-movie.swf">
<embed src="flash-movie.swf" width="500" height="400">
</embed>
</object>
This uses both the <embed> tag and the <object> tag. 
This is because while the <object> tag is recognized by 
Internet Explorer, it is ignored by Netscape, which recognizes 
the <embed> tag.
You do not have to use Flash only for animation. Its built-in 
scripting language is called ActionScript, and allows you to 
allocate actions to buttons, menus and events, such as mouse 
clicks, so that entire websites can be built using only Flash. An 
advantage of Flash is that transitions between pages can be 
smoother using Flash (Fig 6.9). An abrupt jump from one page 
to another in a CSS/XHTML site can be disorienting. However, 
a very slow transition, or fade, can be frustrating to watch.

JavaScript
6.12 Dreamweaver’s Swap Image behaviour will write JavaScript that replaces an image 
with another of the same size when the mouse rolls over it, and will restore the original 
image when the mouse moves away. It also automatically preloads the images so that 
they are ready for action. This is useful for rollover effects with menus or thumbnails
A complete description of JavaScript is not possible  
here, but there are many tutorials on the web, for example at 
www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp, and there are JavaScript 
‘libraries’ on the web, such as jquery.com and script.aculo.us, 
where you can obtain ready-made scripts to cut and paste 	
into your code to add functionality. 
If you are using Dreamweaver, it will create ‘behaviours’ 
without your needing to do any scripting, and place them  
in the HTML (Fig 6.12). A behaviour, in Dreamweaver, is a 
combination of an event and the action triggered by that 
event. In the Behaviours panel, you add a behaviour to a page 
by specifying an action and then specifying the event that 
triggers that action. For example, when a user moves the 
pointer over a link, the browser generates an onMouseOver 
event for that link and the browser checks whether it should call 
some JavaScript code in response. 
Different events are defined for different page elements; for 
example, in most browsers onMouseOver and onClick are 
events associated with links; onLoad is an event associated 
with images. The Swap Image behaviour, for example, swaps 
one image for another of the same size by changing the src 
attribute of the <img> tag. It is used to create button rollovers 
and other image effects. This behaviour will automatically 
preload the images, so they are cached and ready to appear.
Many of the effects that make a website more interactive, such 
as an image changing when your mouse rolls over a menu or 
pop-up windows, are created using JavaScript. It was originally 
developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name 
Mocha, which was later renamed to LiveScript, and is unrelated 
to the programming language Java, although it was developed 
to look like Java, albeit easier for non-programmers to work 
with. JavaScript is a trademark of Sun Microsystems used 
under licence for technology invented and implemented by 
Netscape and its replacements such as Mozilla. It is officially now 
named ECMAScript, ECMA standing for European Computer 
Manufacturers Association, though the term JavaScript is still 
preferred by programmers. ActionScript, the programming 
language used in Adobe Flash, is another implementation of 
the ECMAScript standard.
As a client-side language – that is, run locally in a user’s 
browser (rather than on a remote server) – it responds quickly 
to user actions, making an action seem more responsive. A 
rather trivial example of JavaScript code would be:
<script type="text/javascript">
      document.write('Yo! World');
</script>
<noscript>
Your browser either does not support JavaScript, or you have 
JavaScript turned off.
</noscript>
which writes the phrase ‘Yo! World’ to the screen. Of course, 
HTML is much better at doing that, and JavaScript actions are 
usually more complex. As a client-side language, Java Script 
must be installed (and switched on) on the user’s computer. The 
<noscript> is a courtesy to users without JavaScript – as 
with CSS you should aim for your design to degrade gracefully 
if things go wrong.
A script placed in the <body> of a page, like the one above, 
will be executed immediately the page loads into the browser. 
Scripts to be executed when they are called, or when an event 
is triggered, go into the <head> section. This will ensure that 
the script is loaded and ready before it is needed. As with CSS 
and SSI, longer scripts – and scripts used over and over on 
multiple pages – can be put into a separate external document 
with the suffix .js and brought in by a statement in the <head> 
section, thus:
<script type="text/javascript" src="external-file.js"></script>

Dent has a website hosted by Cargo

E-commerce
6.15 Etsy provides artists and makers with a simple-to-use online outlet for their wares, 
like Emma McCann’s Etsy online shop at www.screeningbluemurder.etsy.com 
do is paste in the HTML code where they recommend.
A more comprehensive service is provided by selling sites 
such as Etsy, which has become popular with artist/makers 
(Fig 6.15). Sellers have personalized stores where they set out 
their wares, rather like an online version of a traditional craft 	
fair. Launched in 2005, Etsy makes money by charging a listing 
fee of 20 cents US for each item and taking a percentage of 
every sale.
When browsing the web, you may have noticed that not every 
page address ends in .html (or even .shtml). A page that ends 
.asp means it is a text file that contains both HTML and scripts 
configured to interact with ASP (Active Server Pages) on the 
server – a server-side program, such as SSI. ASP was introduced 
by Microsoft in 1996 and uses as a default VBScript (Visual 
Basic Scripting), a language similar in function to JavaScript, 
although other languages can be used. An example of the 
syntax would be:
<% Response.Write "Yo! World." %>
PHP, which originally stood for Personal Home Page but 
now means the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, 
is another server-side language: code is embedded into the 
HTML source document and interpreted by a server with a PHP 
processor module, to generate the web page. It started off in 
1994 as a set of CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts written 
in the C programming language by Rasmus Lerdorf to perform 
tasks such as displaying his résumé and recording how much 
traffic his page was receiving. It is free software released under 
licence by www.php.net. As well as for e-commerce sites, PHP 
is used by many social networking and blogging sites, such as 
Facebook and WordPress. Syntax is of the form:
<?php echo 'Yo! World.'; ?>
To keep a large-scale online shopping website up to date 
and constantly changing would be a mammoth, if not impossible, 
task to undertake manually (Fig 6.14). Technologies such as 
ASP and PHP, working with a database management system 
such as MySQL (Structured Query Language, named after 
developer Michael Widenius’s daughter My), enable a website 
to respond ‘on the fly’ creating unique responsive pages as 
you browse them.
For small-scale merchandise operations – suppose you 
wish to sell T-shirts, badges or prints from your website – there 
are a number of simpler options. The most basic method is to 
communicate with your customers by email. If you want to be 
able to process credit card transactions, you will need to set 
up a PayPal account. PayPal is now a subsidiary of auction 
site eBay and takes a commission for every transaction. You 
will need an account, but your customers need not have one. 
The PayPal website will produce form code that, for example, 
creates a ‘Buy now’ button for each of your products, which 
takes the customer to www.paypal.com for processing; all you

e-commerce website comprises all the 
necessary features to search for and

the world, in many different languages.  
Not all IKEA's products are delivered,  
so you can print out a shopping list to  
take to your nearest store.

Content-
management 
systems
One application of PHP is the content-management system 
(CMS). What do you do if you have created a website and the 
client wants to be able to update it, but knows nothing about 
HTML? You configure a CMS so that their adding to or modifying 
a website becomes a form-filling exercise. If you have used 
WordPress, you’ll get the idea. Adobe’s answer is a program 
called Contribute, designed to integrate with Dreamweaver, 
which consists of a ‘client’ for editing, and a ‘publishing server’. 
Users can make updates via a browser. As a commercial product, 
it does come with a price tag. Other CMSs include Drupal, 
ExpressionEngine and Joomla, but our old friend WordPress is 
one of the most popular.
With a CMS, the designer sets up a template and the client 
logs on to a password-protected form via his or her browser to 
add or update content (Fig 6.16). Plug-ins or modules can be 
installed to extend a site’s functionality. Although they claim to 
be easy to use for the non-coder, as with blogs, a little HTML 
knowledge can help immensely, especially when troubleshooting. 
For example, when pasting  
in text from a word processor, the type formatting can sometimes 
be brought in too, overriding the CSS of the site. It’s simple 
enough to go into the HTML and remove any spurious <span> 
tags containing font info if you know what to look for. Conversely, 
anyone with a modicum of HTML knowledge can find the CMS 
experience very frustrating, so be aware of your customer’s 
skill base. 
Generally speaking, using a CMS has no effect on the look 
and feel of the site – that is determined by the designer in the 
CSS. The designer can also provide different levels of access 
to a CMS: a simple interface for casual users, such as members 
of a portfolio site, to update their text and images, with more 
power being allocated to people with admin access. Workflow 
management can also be set up, so that, say, a content creator 
could submit a story in draft mode, which would not be published 
until a copy editor had cleaned it up and the editor-in-chief 
approved it.
6.17 Sixpack is a French clothing retailer, 
based in Avignon, specializing in graffiti-
based T-shirts. Their e-commerce website 
is clear, uncluttered and fast. It builds on 
the user experience by adding links to 
RSS, Twitter, Facebook and MySpace
6.16 The Brighton Illustrators Group 
website, designed by Tim Jukes, uses the 
ExpressionEngine content management 
system so that users can update the 
content. This is the slightly more complex 
admin screen for data entry, very similar 	
to WordPress

6.19 Duane King’s inspirational Thinking 
for a Living website has been created to 
work on the smaller screens of mobile 
devices, as well as on larger screens (see 
page 121). Being WordPress-based, there 
are programs such as MobilePress, a free 
WordPress plug-in, that can make your 
blog mobile-friendly

More and more mobile devices, such as smart phones, can 
be used to access websites while you are on the move. Apart 
from the iPad (Fig 6.21) and similar rival devices that use 
Google’s Android operating system, most have small screens 
– from 128 x 160px to 320 x 480px – and utilize a relatively 
large menu-choosing device: the human finger. 
Consequently, websites specifically for mobile devices 
should be clear and legible, and have simple, foolproof navigation 
(Figs 6.19 and 6.20). If you have designed your website using 
CSS, with the XHTML content logically organized, then it may 
be just a matter of adding another style sheet using the <link> 
command – some handhelds don’t recognize @import – and 
they won’t have to download linked style sheets, an important 
saving when bandwidth is tight. 
If you place the handheld style sheet after the screen style 
sheet in your code, use display: none to hide navigation 
columns, floats, big images, advertising, and whatever else you 
don’t want to send to the tiny screen of the mobile device. The 
code in the <head> section should look something like this:
Websites for 
handheld mobile 
devices
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" 
href="screen.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="handheld" 
href="mobile.css" />
If however, mobile phone access is an important part of 
your client’s business, then a separate long and thin one-column 
site will have to be built from scratch (Fig 6.22). 
Most mobile users will access a website using a search, 
so browser detection (PHP scripts can be found on the web) 
can be used to choose the appropriate CSS or redirect to the 
separate website, usually identified by the domain .mobi or by 
a subdomain such as mobile.yoursite.com, m.yoursite.com or 
www.yoursite.com/mobile. 
Your mobile-friendly website can be tested on various 
models of mobile phone using an emulator such as http://mtld.
mobi/emulator.php. It is also possible to see how a website will 
look on a handheld device using the Opera desktop browser,

in small-screen view. It is essential that you validate your code, 
as mobile browsers will be less capable at recovering from 
invalid code than their more forgiving desktop counterparts. 
	
Here is a checklist of other important factors to consider:
	
• Remove unnecessary content: keep headers small and restrict the size 	
	
	 and number of images. A website designed for a large landscape 	
	
	 desktop screen will not work well on a tiny portrait phone screen. Avoid 	
	
	 JavaScript and any multimedia, and remove unnecessary ads. Forget 	
	
	 any fancy font information – there are so many different devices out 	
	
	 there, most will end up using their own defaults anyway.
	
• Satisfy your users’ needs quickly: mobile users want information fast at 
	
	 any location or time, to find directions for a restaurant nearby, for example.
	
• Keep navigation simple and concise: put menus at the top and bottom 	
	
	 of every page so they are never far away. Breadcrumb-type navigation 	
	
	 saves space and is efficient to use. Include a Back button on every page 	
	
	 and make sure your image alt tags are descriptive, in case the actual 	
	
	 images are not loaded.
	
• Provide obvious feedback: your pointing device is used both for 	
	
	 scrolling and selecting hot links, so make the appearance of the link 	
	
	 change dramatically – use a contrasting background colour, for example 	
	
	 – to reassure the user that it has been properly selected.
	
• Keep user input simple: entering text on a mobile phone can be	
	
	 painfully slow and error-prone, so allow users to input information by 	
	
	 making selections instead.  
	
Non-mobile-friendly CSS properties to watch out for include:
 	
•	Float and display: because these properties are traditionally used to 	
	
	 create multi-column layouts, they would require mobile users to scroll 	
	
	 or zoom, and many mobile devices cannot scroll horizontally.
 	
•	Padding and margin: since screen space is limited on mobile devices, 	
	
	 you should reduce these to a minimum or remove them altogether. 
 	
•	Background image: images used for decorating a website for desktop 	
	
	 browsers tend to be pretty big files and can have a detrimental effect 	
	
	 on a mobile device, so they ought to be removed or replaced.
This brings us almost full circle: the basic one-column 
website that uses browser defaults as described in Chapter 2 
would work fine on mobile devices. If mobile devices play a 
part in your future, you may go on to develop ‘apps’ – small 
programs developed specifically for smart phones. As a starting 
point there are ready-made apps available, such as those at 
www.chrismayerapps.co.uk/buycode/ that allow you to create 
e-books by adding your content to templates. This could be yet 
another avenue into creating accessible portfolios and improving 
further your visibility on the web.
6.22 Websites for mobile devices should 
have a simple one-column layout with 
fewer and smaller images, and clear 
navigation on the top and bottom of 
the resulting long, thin page – as in  
m.smashingmagazine.com, the mobile 
version of Smashing Magazine’s website

Web 2.0, HTML5 
and the future
And so we arrive full circle. Web 2.0 is rather an optimistic term, 
giving an impression of an entirely new version of the web, 	
one that is interactive, collaborative, democratic and sociable, 
compared with a passive and static Web 1.0. The term was 
first used by Darcy DiNucci in her 1999 article ‘Fragmented 
Future’; World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee was not 
impressed – this was how he intended the web to be in the 
first place. Social networking sites such as Facebook have 
driven the change, making the web accessible to millions, 
adding a whole new way of communicating to our lives and 
establishing worldwide communities based on shared 
interests and hobbies. 
A common comparison is Web 1.0’s Encyclopedia Britannica 
versus Web 2.0’s Wikipedia: Britannica. The former relies on 
experts to create articles and publishes them periodically with 
a price tag; Wikipedia trusts anonymous users to build content 
and edit it, which is available free to the user. Web 2.0 sites are 
typified by the following features (Andrew McAfee coined the 
mnemonic SLATES):
• Search: The ability to find information via keywords
• Links: Making connections between sources of information
• Authoring: The ability to create and update content 	
	
	 individually or collaboratively: in wikis, where users can 	
	 expand, undo and redo others’ work; in blogs, where posts 	
	 and their comments build up over time
• Tags: Categorizing content by adding user-defined single-	
	 word descriptions
• Extensions: Using software that makes the web an 	
	
	 application platform rather than simply a document server
• Signals: Using syndication technology such as RSS to notify 	
	 users of content updates
RSS and Twitter
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based web feed 
format. Using a desktop reader such as NetNewsWire (for Macs) 
or FeedDemon (for PCs), you can be kept informed of any new 
items appearing on blogs, forums or news websites, and if the 
synopsis looks interesting, click to be taken to the full article on 
the website. Browsers also now support RSS feeds, and there 
are versions of the readers for the iPhone.
Another source of hot news is Twitter, which can be a very 
powerful self-promotion tool. Although restricted to ‘tweets’ 
of 140 characters, by using a URL shortening service such as 
bit.ly or tinyurl.com, you can inform your followers of any news 
as it happens. Retweeting other interesting messages helps 
you build up your audience. Like Facebook groups, Twitter has 
become a great campaigning device, able to gather support very 
quickly. Unlike blogs, which are archived, tweets are ephemeral 
and disappear almost as soon as they appear.
It is relatively easy to incorporate an RSS or Twitter feed 
into a blog, using Alex King’s Twitter Tools on a WordPress blog 
for example. If you have a static website (for the all-time best 
photos in your portfolio, for example) and a blog, then as well as 
linking to your blog from your website, you can show visitors to 
it the most up-to-date postings by incorporating an RSS feed 
on your website. This will take some PHP or JavaScript 
programming, but using software such as Magpie RSS or a 
service such as feed2js.org, it can quickly be created. All you 
need is the URL of the blog’s feed, for example:
http://janedoephotography.wordpress.com/feed/
or
http://www.janedoephotography.co.uk/blog/rss.xml
 
Your last three or four tweets can also be embedded on an 
HTML page using a Twitter widget by cutting and pasting some 
JavaScript. The containing box can be customized by size and 
colour, but may look out of place in a particular layout.

156
Chapter 6
Photos, YouTube and Vimeo
The HTML code to embed a photo in a web page that was 
once found on the All Sizes page is now only in Share This. To 
get to it, go to the main photo page, click Share This, choose 
the size you want, and then choose Grab the HTML/BBCode 
and copy the code generated into your web page (Fig 6.23). 
BBCode is standard message board code, for use in Forum 
posts. You can also add a box containing, say, the last three 
Flickr photos you uploaded, by installing a Flickr ‘badge’, again 
by copying the code generated; or a slideshow, by starting the 
slideshow, hitting the Share button top right, and copying and 
pasting the code. Similarly, why host video clips when you can 
first upload them to YouTube or Vimeo and then cut and paste 
the code into your HTML (Fig 6.25)? You can even embed 
Google maps into your pages by copying the code provided 
(Fig 6.24). 
HTML5
HTML5 is the successor to HTML4.01 and XHTML1.1, in 
development at the time of writing, and will incorporate 
features like video playback and drag-and-drop, which have 
previously been dependent on third-party browser plug-ins 
such as Adobe Flash. New tags will replace generic block <div> 
and inline <span> elements with more descriptive ones such 
as <nav> (website navigation block) and <footer>. New 
elements include the multimedia elements <audio> and 
<video> that avoid the need for Flash, and deprecated tags 
such as <font> and <centre> will be completely outlawed, 
with CSS taking over their function.
Whatever the potential of new developments, always 
remember, like an over-elaborate cake, your website could 
become too rich – so exercise restraint and only add the bells 
and whistles that genuinely enhance the user’s experience of 
your website.

case one of medium size (450 x 338px), into your website, saving you the trouble of

Websites
There are many website resources, 
mostly free. The hardest part is 
finding the one that you need and 
that is at the right level. Note that 
web addresses often change, so if 
the link doesn’t work, try putting 
the key words into a search engine 
such as Google.
