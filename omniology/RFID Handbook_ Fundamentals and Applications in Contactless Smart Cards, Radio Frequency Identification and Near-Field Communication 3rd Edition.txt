Preface to the Third Edition
This book is aimed at an extremely wide range of readers. First and foremost it is intended for
engineers and students who ﬁnd themselves confronted with RFID technology for the ﬁrst time. A
few basic chapters are provided for this audience describing the functionality of RFID technology
and the physical and IT-related principles underlying this ﬁeld. The book is also intended for
practitioners who, as users, wish to or need to obtain as comprehensive and detailed an overview
of the various technologies, the legal framework or the possible applications of RFID as possible.
Although a wide range of individual articles are now available on this subject, the task of
gathering all this scattered information together when it is needed is a tiresome and time-consuming
one – as researching each new edition of this book proves. This book therefore aims to ﬁll a gap
in the range of literature on the subject of RFID. The need for well-founded technical literature in
this ﬁeld is proven by the fortunate fact that this book has now already appeared in ﬁve languages.
Editions in two further languages are currently being prepared. Further information on the German
version of the RFID handbook and the translations can be found on the homepage of this book,
http://RFID-handbook.com.
This book uses numerous pictures and diagrams to attempt to give a graphic representation of
RFID technology in the truest sense of the word. Particular emphasis is placed on the physical
principles of RFID, which is why the chapter on this subject is by far the most comprehensive
of the book. However, great importance is also assigned to providing an understanding of the
basic concepts, data carrier and reader, as well as of the relevant standards and radio-technology
regulations.
Technological developments in the ﬁeld of RFID technology are proceeding at such a pace that
although a book like this can explain the general scientiﬁc principles it is not dynamic enough
to be able to explore the latest trends regarding the most recent products on the market and the
latest standards and regulations. With the widespread use of RFID technology, it becomes also
increasingly difﬁcult not to lose track of applications. In ever-shorter intervals, the media provides
information on new applications for RFID systems. I am therefore grateful for any suggestions and
advice – particularly from the ﬁeld of industry. The basic concepts and underlying physical princi-
ples remain, however, and provide a good background for understanding the latest developments.
A new addition to this third edition is Near-Field Communication (NFC) which has been intro-
duced to several different chapters. Chapter 3 now includes the fundamentals of NFC; and Chapter
13 presents NFC interface components and describes the extension from NFC to secure-NFC.
Another addition is a complete wiring diagram and proposed circuit for an RFID reader according
to ISO/IEC 14443. A layout and complete component kit of this wiring diagram and circuit is also
available on the Internet.
It was a very special occasion when the Fraunhofer Smart Card Prize 2008 – which annually
honors special contributions to smart-card technology - was awarded to the known smart-card

Preface
handbook of my two colleagues Rankl and Efﬁng as well as to this RFID handbook. The prize-
giving ceremony took place on the occasion of the 18th Smart-Card Workshop of the Fraunhofer
Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) in Darmstadt on 5 February 2008.
In March 2008, we were able to look back on ten successful years of the RFID Handbook. The
ﬁrst German-language edition was published in March 1998 and comprised 280 pages. At that time,
RFID was still a niche technology and hardly known to the public; this has completely changed.
Today, RFID has become an established term; and due to applications such as the electronic passport
and electronic product code (EPC), a broad public has become aware of this technology.
At this point I would also like to express my thanks to all companies which were kind enough
to contribute to the success of this project by providing numerous technical data sheets, lecture
manuscripts, drawings and photographs.

Introduction
In recent years automatic identiﬁcation procedures (Auto-ID) have become very popular in many
service industries, purchasing and distribution logistics, industry, manufacturing companies and
material ﬂow systems. Automatic identiﬁcation procedures exist to provide information about
people, animals, goods and products in transit.
The omnipresent barcode labels that triggered a revolution in identiﬁcation systems some con-
siderable time ago, are being found to be inadequate in an increasing number of cases. Barcodes
may be extremely cheap, but their stumbling block is their low storage capacity and the fact that
they cannot be reprogrammed.
The technically optimal solution would be the storage of data in a silicon chip. The most common
form of electronic data-carrying devices in use in everyday life is the smart card based upon a contact
ﬁeld (telephone smart card, bank cards). However, the mechanical contact used in the smart card is
often impractical. A contactless transfer of data between the data-carrying device and its reader is
far more ﬂexible. In the ideal case, the power required to operate the electronic data-carrying device
would also be transferred from the reader using contactless technology. Because of the procedures
used for the transfer of power and data, contactless ID systems are called RFID systems (radio
frequency identiﬁcation).
The number of companies actively involved in the development and sale of RFID systems
indicates that this is a market that should be taken seriously. Whereas global sales of RFID sys-
tems were approximately 900 million $US in the year 2000 it is estimated that this ﬁgure will
reach 2650 million $US in 2005 (Krebs, n.d.). The RFID market therefore belongs to the fastest
growing sector of the radio technology industry, including mobile phones and cordless telephones
(Figure 1.1).
Furthermore, in recent years contactless identiﬁcation has been developing into an independent
interdisciplinary ﬁeld, which no longer ﬁts into any of the conventional pigeonholes. It brings
together elements from extremely varied ﬁelds: RF technology and EMC, semiconductor technol-
ogy, data protection and cryptography, telecommunications, manufacturing technology and many
related areas.
As an introduction, the following section gives a brief overview of different automatic ID systems
that perform similar functions to RFID (Figure 1.2).

Barcode Systems
Barcodes have successfully held their own against other identiﬁcation systems over the past 20
years. According to experts, the turnover volume for barcode systems totalled around 3 billion DM
in Western Europe at the beginning of the 1990s (Virnich and Posten, 1992).

The barcode is a binary code comprising a ﬁeld of bars and gaps arranged in a parallel conﬁg-
uration. They are arranged according to a predetermined pattern and represent data elements that
refer to an associated symbol. The sequence, made up of wide and narrow bars and gaps, can
be interpreted numerically and alphanumerically. It is read by optical laser scanning, i.e. by the
different reﬂection of a laser beam from the black bars and white gaps (ident, 1996). However,
despite being identical in their physical design, there are considerable differences between the code
layouts in the approximately ten different barcode types currently in use.
The most popular barcode by some margin is the EAN code (European Article Number), which
was designed speciﬁcally to fulﬁl the requirements of the grocery industry in 1976. The EAN
code represents a development of the UPC (Universal Product Code) from the USA, which was
introduced in the USA as early as 1973. Today, the UPC represents a subset of the EAN code, and
is therefore compatible with it (Virnich and Posten, 1992).
The EAN code is made up of 13 digits: the country identiﬁer, the company identiﬁer, the
manufacturer’s item number and a check digit.
In addition to the EAN code, the barcodes shown in Table 1.1 are popular in other industrial ﬁelds.
1.1.2
Optical Character Recognition
Optical character recognition (OCR) was ﬁrst used in the 1960s. Special fonts were developed for
this application that stylised characters so that they could be read both in the normal way by people
and automatically by machines. The most important advantage of OCR systems is the high density
of information and the possibility of reading data visually in an emergency, or simply for checking
(Virnich and Posten, 1992). Today, OCR is used in production, service and administrative ﬁelds,
and also in banks for the registration of cheques (personal data, such as name and account number,
is printed on the bottom line of a cheque in OCR type). However, OCR systems have failed to
become universally applicable because of their high price and the complicated readers that they
require in comparison with other ID procedures.

Biometric Procedures
Biometrics is deﬁned as the science of counting and (body) measurement procedures involving
living beings. In the context of identiﬁcation systems, biometry is the general term for all procedures
that identify people by comparing unmistakable and individual physical characteristics. In practice,
these are ﬁngerprinting and handprinting procedures, voice identiﬁcation and, less commonly, retina
(or iris) identiﬁcation.
1.1.3.1
Voice Identiﬁcation
Recently, specialised systems have become available to identify individuals using speaker veriﬁca-
tion (speaker recognition). In such systems, the user talks into a microphone linked to a computer.
This equipment converts the spoken words into digital signals, which are evaluated by the identi-
ﬁcation software.
The objective of speaker veriﬁcation is to check the supposed identity of the person based upon
their voice. This is achieved by checking the speech characteristics of the speaker against an existing
reference pattern. If they correspond, then a reaction can be initiated (e.g. ‘open door’).
1.1.3.2
Fingerprinting Procedures (Dactyloscopy)
Criminology has been using ﬁngerprinting procedures for the identiﬁcation of criminals since the
early twentieth century. This process is based upon the comparison of papillae and dermal ridges
of the ﬁngertips, which can be obtained not only from the ﬁnger itself, but also from objects that
the individual in question has touched.
When ﬁngerprinting procedures are used for personal identiﬁcation, usually for entrance proce-
dures, the ﬁngertip is placed upon a special reader. The system calculates a data record from the
pattern it has read and compares this with a stored reference pattern. Modern ﬁngerprint ID systems
require less than half a second to recognise and check a ﬁngerprint. In order to prevent violent
frauds, ﬁngerprint ID systems have even been developed that can detect whether the ﬁnger placed
on the reader is that of a living person (Schmidh¨ausler, 1995).
1.1.4
Smart Cards
A smart card is an electronic data storage system, possibly with additional computing capacity
(microprocessor card), which – for convenience – is incorporated into a plastic card the size of
a credit card. The ﬁrst smart cards in the form of prepaid telephone smart cards were launched
in 1984. Smart cards are placed in a reader, which makes a galvanic connection to the contact
surfaces of the smart card using contact springs. The smart card is supplied with energy and a
clock pulse from the reader via the contact surfaces. Data transfer between the reader and the card
takes place using a bidirectional serial interface (I/O port). It is possible to differentiate between
two basic types of smart card based upon their internal functionality: the memory card and the
microprocessor card.
One of the primary advantages of the smart card is the fact that the data stored on it can be
protected against undesired (read) access and manipulation. Smart cards make all services that relate
to information or ﬁnancial transactions simpler, safer and cheaper. For this reason, 200 million smart
cards were issued worldwide in 1992. In 1995 this ﬁgure had risen to 600 million, of which 500
million were memory cards and 100 million were microprocessor cards. The smart card market
therefore represents one of the fastest growing subsectors of the microelectronics industry.

One disadvantage of contact-based smart cards is the vulnerability of the contacts to wear,
corrosion and dirt. Readers that are used frequently are expensive to maintain due to their tendency
to malfunction. In addition, readers that are accessible to the public (telephone boxes) cannot be
protected against vandalism.
1.1.4.1
Memory Cards
In memory cards the memory – usually an EEPROM – is accessed using a sequential logic (state
machine) (Figure 1.5). It is also possible to incorporate simple security algorithms, e.g. stream
ciphering, using this system. The functionality of the memory card in question is usually optimised
for a speciﬁc application. Flexibility of application is highly limited but, on the positive side,
memory cards are very cost effective. For this reason, memory cards are predominantly used in
price-sensitive, large-scale applications (Rankl and Efﬁng, 1996). One example of this is the national
insurance card used by the state pension system in Germany (Lemme, 1993).

1.1.4.2
Microprocessor Cards
As the name suggests, microprocessor cards contain a microprocessor, which is connected to a
segmented memory (ROM, RAM and EEPROM segments).
The mask programmed ROM incorporates an operating system (higher program code) for the
microprocessor and is inserted during chip manufacture. The contents of the ROM are determined
during manufacturing, are identical for all microchips from the same production batch, and cannot
be overwritten.
The chip’s EEPROM contains application data and application-related program code. Reading
from or writing to this memory area is controlled by the operating system.
The RAM is the microprocessor’s temporary working memory. Data stored in the RAM are lost
when the supply voltage is disconnected.
Microprocessor cards are very ﬂexible. In modern smart card systems it is also possible to
integrate different applications in a single card (multi-application). The application-speciﬁc parts
of the program are not loaded into the EEPROM until after manufacture and can be initiated via
the operating system.
Microprocessor cards are primarily used in security-sensitive applications. Examples are smart
cards for GSM mobile phones and the new EC (electronic cash) cards. The option of program-
ming the microprocessor cards also facilitates rapid adaptation to new applications (Rankl and
Efﬁng, 1996).
1.1.5
RFID Systems
RFID systems are closely related to the smart cards described above. Like smart card systems,
data is stored on an electronic data-carrying device – the transponder. However, unlike the smart
card, the power supply to the data-carrying device and the data exchange between the data-carrying
device and the reader are achieved without the use of galvanic contacts, using instead magnetic or
electromagnetic ﬁelds. The underlying technical procedure is drawn from the ﬁelds of radio and
radar engineering. The abbreviation RFID stands for radio frequency identiﬁcation, i.e. information
carried by radio waves.
Due to the numerous advantages of RFID systems compared with other identiﬁcation systems,
RFID systems are now beginning to conquer new mass markets. One example is the use of con-
tactless smart cards as tickets for short-distance public transport.
1.2
A Comparison of Different ID Systems
A comparison between the identiﬁcation systems described above highlights the strengths and weak-
ness of RFID in relation to other systems (Table 1.2). Here too, there is a close relationship between
contact-based smart cards and RFID systems; however, the latter circumvent all the disadvantages
related to faulty contacting (sabotage, dirt, unidirectional insertion, time-consuming insertion, etc.).
1.3
Components of an RFID System
An RFID system is always made up of two components (Figure 1.6):
• the transponder, which is located on the object to be identiﬁed;
• the interrogator or reader, which, depending upon the design and the technology used, may be a
read or write/read device (in this book – in accordance with normal colloquial usage – the data
capture device is always referred to as the reader, regardless of whether it can only read data or
is also capable of writing).

Introduction
9
A reader typically contains a radio frequency module (transmitter and receiver), a control unit
and a coupling element to the transponder. In addition, many readers are ﬁtted with an additional
interface (RS 232, RS 485, etc.) to enable them to forward the data received to another system
(PC, robot control system, etc.).
The transponder, which represents the actual data-carrying device of an RFID system, normally
consists of a coupling element and an electronic microchip. When the transponder, which does not
usually possess its own voltage supply (battery), is not within the interrogation zone of a reader it
is totally passive. The transponder is only activated when it is within the interrogation zone of a
reader. The power required to activate the transponder is supplied to the transponder through the
coupling unit (contactless), as are the timing pulse and data.

Differentiation Features
of RFID Systems
2.1
Fundamental Differentiation Features
RFID systems exist in countless variants, produced by an almost equally high number of manufac-
turers. If we are to maintain an overview of RFID systems we must seek out features that can be
used to differentiate one RFID system from another (Figure 2.1).
RFID systems operate according to one of two basic procedures: full-duplex (FDX)/half-duplex
(HDX) systems, and sequential systems (SEQ).
In full-duplex and half-duplex systems the transponder’s response is broadcast when the reader’s
RF ﬁeld is switched on. Because the transponder’s signal to the receiver antenna can be extremely
weak in comparison with the signal from the reader itself, appropriate transmission procedures
must be employed to differentiate the transponder’s signal from that of the reader. In practice, data
transfer from transponder to reader takes place using load modulation, load modulation using a
subcarrier, and also (sub)harmonics of the reader’s transmission frequency.
In contrast, sequential procedures employ a system whereby the ﬁeld from the reader is switched
off brieﬂy at regular intervals. These gaps are recognised by the transponder and used for sending
data from the transponder to the reader. The disadvantage of the sequential procedure is the loss
of power to the transponder during the break in transmission, which must be smoothed out by the
provision of sufﬁcient auxiliary capacitors or batteries.
The data capacities of RFID transponders normally range from a few bytes to several kilobytes.
So-called 1-bit transponders represent the exception to this rule. A data quantity of exactly 1-bit
is just enough to signal two states to the reader: ‘transponder in the ﬁeld’ or ‘no transponder in
the ﬁeld’. However, this is perfectly adequate to fulﬁl simple monitoring or signalling functions.
Because a 1-bit transponder does not need an electronic chip, these transponders can be manufac-
tured for a fraction of a penny. For this reason, vast numbers of 1-bit transponders are used in
electronic article surveillance (EAS) to protect goods in shops and businesses. If someone attempts
to leave the shop with goods that have not been paid for the reader installed in the exit recognises
the state ‘transponder in the ﬁeld’ and initiates the appropriate reaction. The 1-bit transponder is
removed or deactivated at the till when the goods are paid for.
The possibility of writing data to the transponder provides us with another way of classifying
RFID systems. In very simple systems the transponder’s data record, usually a simple (serial)

number, is incorporated when the chip is manufactured and cannot be altered thereafter. In writable
transponders, on the other hand, the reader can write data to the transponder. Three main procedures
are used to store the data: in inductively coupled RFID systems EEPROMs (electrically erasable
programmable read-only memory) are dominant. However, these have the disadvantages of high
power consumption during the writing operation and a limited number of write cycles (typically
of the order of 100 000–1000 000). FRAMs (ferromagnetic random access memory) have recently
been used in isolated cases. The read power consumption of FRAMs is lower than that of EEPROMs
by a factor of 100 and the writing time is 1000 times lower. Manufacturing problems have hindered
its widespread introduction onto the market as yet.
Particularly common in microwave systems, SRAMs (static random access memory) are also
used for data storage, and facilitate very rapid write cycles. However, data retention requires an
uninterruptible power supply from an auxiliary battery.
In programmable systems, write and read access to the memory and any requests for write and
read authorisation must be controlled by the data carrier’s internal logic. In the simplest case these
functions can be realised by a state machine (see Chapter 10 for further information). Very complex
sequences can be realised using state machines. However, the disadvantage of state machines is
their inﬂexibility regarding changes to the programmed functions, because such changes necessitate
changes to the circuitry of the silicon chip. In practice, this means redesigning the chip layout, with
all the associated expense.
The use of a microprocessor improves upon this situation considerably. An operating system for
the management of application data is incorporated into the processor during manufacture using
a mask. Changes are thus cheaper to implement and, in addition, the software can be speciﬁcally
adapted to perform very different applications.

Differentiation Features of RFID Systems
13
In the context of contactless smart cards, writable data carriers with a state machine are also
known as ‘memory cards’, to distinguish them from ‘processor cards’.
In this context, we should also mention transponders that can store data by utilising physical
effects. This includes the read-only surface wave transponder and 1-bit transponders that can usually
be deactivated (set to 0), but can rarely be reactivated (set to 1).
One very important feature of RFID systems is the power supply to the transponder. Passive
transponders do not have their own power supply, and therefore all power required for the oper-
ation of a passive transponder must be drawn from the (electrical/magnetic) ﬁeld of the reader.
Conversely, active transponders incorporate a battery, which supplies all or part of the power for
the operation of a microchip.
One of the most important characteristics of RFID systems is the operating frequency and the
resulting range of the system. The operating frequency of an RFID system is the frequency at which
the reader transmits. The transmission frequency of the transponder is disregarded. In most cases it
is the same as the transmission frequency of the reader (load modulation, backscatter). However, the
transponder’s ‘transmitting power’ may be set several powers of ten lower than that of the reader.
The different transmission frequencies are classiﬁed into the three basic ranges, LF (low fre-
quency, 30–300 kHz), HF (high frequency)/RF radio frequency (3–30 MHz) and UHF (ultra-high
frequency, 300 MHz–3 GHz)/microwave (>3 GHz). A further subdivision of RFID systems accord-
ing to range allows us to differentiate between close-coupling (0–1 cm), remote-coupling (0–1 m),
and long-range (>1 m) systems.
The different procedures for sending data from the transponder back to the reader can be classiﬁed
into three groups: (i) the use of reﬂection or backscatter (the frequency of the reﬂected wave
corresponds with the transmission frequency of the reader →frequency ratio 1:1); or (ii) load
modulation (the reader’s ﬁeld is inﬂuenced by the transponder →frequency ratio 1:1); and (iii) the
use of subharmonics (1/n-fold) and the generation of harmonic waves (n-fold) in the transponder.
2.2
Transponder Construction Formats
2.2.1
Disks and Coins
The most common construction format is the so-called disk (coin), a transponder in a round (ABS)
injection moulded housing, with a diameter ranging from a few millimetres to 10 cm (Figure 2.2).
There is usually a hole for a fastening screw in the centre. As an alternative to (ABS) injection
moulding, polystyrol or even epoxy resin may be used to achieve a wider operating tempera-
ture range.
2.2.2
Glass Housing
Glass transponders have been developed that can be injected under the skin of an animal for
identiﬁcation purposes (see Chapter 13).
Glass tubes of length just 12–32 mm contain a microchip mounted upon a carrier (PCB) and
a chip capacitor to smooth the supply current obtained. The transponder coil incorporates wire of
just 0.03 mm thickness wound onto a ferrite core. The internal components are embedded in a soft
adhesive to achieve mechanical stability.
2.2.3
Plastic Housing
The plastic housing (plastic package, PP) was developed for applications involving particularly
high mechanical demands. This housing can easily be integrated into other products, for example
into car keys for electronic immobilisation systems.

The wedge made of moulding substance (IC casting compound) contains almost the same com-
ponents as the glass transponder, but its longer coil gives it a greater functional range (Figure 2.6).
Further advantages are its ability to accept larger microchips and its greater tolerance to mechan-
ical vibrations, which is required by the automotive industry, for example. The PP transponder
has proved completely satisfactory with regard to other quality requirements, such as temperature
cycles or fall tests (Bruhnke, 1996).
2.2.4
Tool and Gas Bottle Identiﬁcation
Special construction formats have been developed to install inductively coupled transponders into
metal surfaces. The transponder coil is wound in a ferrite pot core. The transponder chip is mounted
on the reverse of the ferrite pot core and contacted with the transponder coil.
In order to obtain sufﬁcient mechanical stability, vibration and heat tolerance, transponder chip
and ferrite pot core are cast into a PPS shell using epoxy resin (Link, 1996, 1997).
The external dimensions of the transponder and their ﬁtting area have been standardised in
DIN/ISO 69873 for incorporation into a retention knob or quick-release taper for tool identiﬁcation.
Different designs are used for the identiﬁcation of gas bottles.
2.2.5
Keys and Key Fobs
Transponders are also integrated into mechanical keys for immobilisers or door locking applications
with particularly high security requirements. These are generally based upon a transponder in a
plastic housing, which is cast or injected into the key fob.
The keyring transponder design has proved very popular for systems providing access to ofﬁce
and work areas.

Clocks
This construction format was developed at the beginning of the 1990s by the Austrian company
Ski-Data and was ﬁrst used in ski passes. These contactless clocks were also able to gain ground
in access control systems (Figure 2.10). The clock contains a frame antenna with a small number

of windings printed onto a thin printed circuit board, which follows the clock housing as closely
as possible to maximise the area enclosed by the antenna coil – and thus the range.
2.2.7
ID-1 Format, Contactless Smart Cards
The ID-1 format familiar from credit cards and telephone cards (85.72 × 54.03 × 0.76 mm ±
tolerances) is becoming increasingly important for contactless smart cards in RFID systems
(Figure 2.11). One advantage of this format for inductively coupled RFID systems is the large coil
area, which increases the range of the smart cards.
Contactless smart cards are produced by the lamination of a transponder between four PVC
foils. The individual foils are baked at high pressure and temperatures above 100 ◦C to produce a
permanent bond (the manufacture of contactless smart cards is described in detail in Chapter 12).
Contactless smart cards of the design ID-1 are excellently suited for carrying adverts and often
have artistic overprints, like those on telephone cards, for example (Figure 2.12).
However, it is not always possible to adhere to the maximum thickness of 0.8 mm speciﬁed for
ID-1 cards in ISO 7810. Microwave transponders in particular require a thicker design, because in

this design the transponder is usually inserted between two PVC shells or packed using an (ABS)
injection moulding procedure.
2.2.8
Smart Label
The term smart label refers to a paper-thin transponder format. In transponders of this format the
transponder coil is applied to a plastic foil of just 0.1 mm thickness by screen printing or etching.
This foil is often laminated using a layer of paper and its back coated with adhesive. The transpon-
ders are supplied in the form of self-adhesive stickers on an endless roll and are thin and ﬂexible
enough to be stuck to luggage, packages and goods of all types (Figures 2.14, 2.15). Since the

sticky labels can easily be overprinted, it is a simple matter to link the stored data to an additional
barcode on the front of the label.
2.2.9
Coil-on-Chip
In the construction formats mentioned previously the transponders consist of a separate transponder
coil that functions as an antenna and a transponder chip (hybrid technology). The transponder coil
is bonded to the transponder chip in the conventional manner.
An obvious step down the route of miniaturisation is the integration of the coil onto the chip
(coil-on-chip, Figure 2.16). This is made possible by a special microgalvanic process that can take
place on a normal CMOS wafer. The coil is placed directly onto the isolator of the silicon chip in
the form of a planar (single layer) spiral arrangement and contacted to the circuit below by means
of conventional openings in the passivation layer (Jurisch, 1995, 1998). The conductor track widths
achieved lie in the range of 5–10 µm with a layer thickness of 15–30 µm. A ﬁnal passivation onto
a polyamide base is performed to guarantee the mechanical loading capacity of the contactless
memory module based upon coil-on-chip technology.
The size of the silicon chip, and thus the entire transponder, is just 3 × 3 mm. The transponders
are frequently embedded in a plastic shell for convenience and at ⊘6 × 1.5 mm are among the
smallest RFID transponders available on the market.

Other Formats
In addition to these main designs, several application-speciﬁc special designs are also manufactured.
Examples are the ‘racing pigeon transponder’ or the ‘champion chip’ for sports timing. Transponders
can be incorporated into any design required by the customer. The preferred options are glass or
PP transponders, which are then processed further to obtain the ultimate form.
2.3
Frequency, Range and Coupling
The most important differentiation criteria for RFID systems are the operating frequency of the
reader, the physical coupling method and the range of the system. RFID systems are operated
at widely differing frequencies, ranging from 135 kHz longwave to 5.8 GHz in the microwave
range. Electric, magnetic and electromagnetic ﬁelds are used for the physical coupling. Finally, the
achievable range of the system varies from a few millimetres to above 15 m.
RFID systems with a very small range, typically in the region of up to 1 cm, are known as close-
coupling systems. For operation the transponder must either be inserted into the reader or positioned
upon a surface provided for this purpose. Close-coupling systems are coupled using both electric
and magnetic ﬁelds and can theoretically be operated at any desired frequency between DC and
30 MHz because the operation of the transponder does not rely upon the radiation of ﬁelds. The
close coupling between data carrier and reader also facilitates the provision of greater amounts
of power and so even a microprocessor with nonoptimal power consumption, for example, can be
operated. Close-coupling systems are primarily used in applications that are subject to strict security
requirements, but do not require a large range. Examples are electronic door locking systems or
contactless smart card systems with payment functions. Close coupling transponders are currently
used exclusively as ID-1 format contactless smart cards (ISO 10536). However, the role of close
coupling systems on the market is becoming less important.

22
RFID Handbook
Systems with write and read ranges of up to 1 m are known by the collective term of remote
coupling systems. Almost all remote coupled systems are based upon an inductive (magnetic) cou-
pling between reader and transponder. These systems are therefore also known as inductive radio
systems. In addition there are also a few systems with capacitive (electric) coupling (Baddeley and
Ruiz, 1998). At least 90% of all RFID systems currently sold are inductively coupled systems. For
this reason there is now an enormous number of such systems on the market. There is also a series
of standards that specify the technical parameters of transponder and reader for various standard
applications, such as contactless smart cards, animal identiﬁcation or industrial automation. These
also include proximity coupling (ISO 14443, contactless smart cards) and vicinity coupling systems
(ISO 15693, smart label and contactless smart cards). Frequencies below 135 kHz or 13.56 MHz
are used as transmission frequencies. Some special applications (e.g. Eurobalise) are also operated
at 27.125 MHz.
RFID systems with ranges signiﬁcantly above 1 m are known as long-range systems. All long-
range systems operate using electromagnetic waves in the UHF and microwave range. The vast
majority of such systems are also known as backscatter systems due to their physical operating
principle. In addition, there are also long-range systems using surface acoustic wave transponders in
the microwave range. All these systems are operated at the UHF frequencies of 868 MHz (Europe)
and 915 MHz (USA) and at the microwave frequencies of 2.5 GHz and 5.8 GHz. Typical ranges
of 3 m can now be achieved using passive (battery-free) backscatter transponders, while ranges of
15 m and above can even be achieved using active (battery-supported) backscatter transponders. The
battery of an active transponder, however, never provides the power for data transmission between
transponder and reader, but serves exclusively to supply the microchip and for the retention of
stored data. The power of the electromagnetic ﬁeld received from the reader is the only power used
for the data transmission between transponder and reader.
In order to avoid reference to a possibly erroneous range ﬁgure, this book uses only the
terms inductively or capacitively coupled system and microwave system or backscatter system for
classiﬁcation.
2.4
Active and Passive Transponders
An important distinction criterion of different RFID systems is how the energy supply of the
transponder works. Here we distinguish between passive and active transponders. Passive
transponders do not have any power supply. Through the transponder antenna, the magnetic or
electromagnetic ﬁeld of the reader provides all the energy required for operating the transponder.
In order to transmit data from the transponder to the reader, the ﬁeld of the reader can be
modulated (e.g. by load modulation or modulated backscatter; see Section 3.2) or the transponder
can intermediately store, for a short time, energy from the ﬁeld of the reader (see Section 3.3).
That means that the energy emitted by the reader is used for data transmission both from the
reader to the transponder and back to the reader. If the transponder is located outside the reader’s
range, the transponder has no power supply at all and, therefore, will not be able to send signals.
Active transponders have their own energy supply, e.g. in form of a battery or a solar cell.
Here the power supply is used to provide voltage to the chip. The magnetic or electromagnetic
ﬁeld received by the reader is therefore no longer necessary for the power supply of the chip. That
means that the ﬁeld may be much weaker than the ﬁeld required for operating a passive transponder.
This condition can substantially increase the communication range if the transponder is capable of
detecting the weaker reader signal. But even an active RFID transponder is not able to generate
a high-frequency signal of its own, but can only modulate the reader ﬁeld in order to transmit
data between transponder and reader, similar to the procedure in passive transponders. Thus, the
energy from the transponder’s own power supply does not contribute to data transmission from the
transponder to the reader! In the literature, this type of transponder is often called ‘semi-passive’

transponder (Kleist et al., 2004), which refers to the fact that this transponder is not able to generate
a high-frequency signal.
As both passive and active (semi-active) RFID transponders need the reader’s magnetic or
electromagnetic ﬁeld for transmitting data, there are physical limitations that substantially restrict
the achievable reading ranges. Taking into account the permitted transmitting power of RFID
readers, the maximum achievable range is 15 m, depending on the frequency band.
The circuit design of another class of active transponders corresponds to that of a classic
radio device. These transponders have an active transmitter (TX) and often also a high-quality
receiver (RX). In order to transmit data to a reader, a transmitter is switched on and the antenna
emits a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld. A local energy source, e.g. a battery, supplies the
transponder with power.
These transponders emit a high-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld instead of modulating the reader’s
ﬁeld. From a pure technical perspective, these transponders are not genuine ‘RFID’ transponders,
but short-range radio devices (SRD). For several decades, similar devices have been used for data

24
RFID Handbook
transmission from remote places, for instance. Due to other physical mechanisms and taking into
account the permitted transmitting power, short-range devices can have a range of up to several
hundred metres. The larger the transmitting power, the larger the ranges that can be achieved, in
comparison with conventional radio equipment.
In order to beneﬁt from the continuing RFID boom, short-range devices are marketed as RFID
devices. From a marketing perspective, this is a feasible approach. However, a technician should be
always aware of the differences between RFID and short-range devices, as well as of the reasons
behind the large range of SRD.
The RFID handbook does not include short-range devices as there is a large number of specialist
literature on this topic. For an introduction, we recommend Bensky (2000).
2.5
Information Processing in the Transponder
If we classify RFID systems according to the range of information and data processing functions
offered by the transponder and the size of its data memory, we obtain a broad spectrum of variants.
The extreme ends of this spectrum are represented by low-end and high-end systems.
• EAS systems (electronic article surveillance systems; see Section 3.1) represent the bottom end
of low-end systems. These systems check and monitor the possible presence of a transponder in
the interrogation zone of a detection unit’s reader using simple physical effects.
• Read-only transponders with a microchip are also classiﬁed as low-end systems. These transpon-
ders have a permanently encoded data set that generally consists only of a unique serial number
(unique number) made up of several bytes. If a read-only transponder is placed in the RF ﬁeld of
a reader, the transponder begins to continuously broadcast its own serial number. It is not possi-
ble for the reader to address a read-only transponder – there is a unidirectional ﬂow of data from
the transponder to the reader. In practical operation of a read-only system, it is also necessary to
ensure that there is only ever one transponder in the reader’s interrogation zone, otherwise the
two or more transponders simultaneously transmitting would lead to a data collision. The reader
would no longer be able to detect the transponder. Despite this limitation, read-only transponders
are excellently suited for many applications in which it is sufﬁcient for one unique number to be
read. Because of the simple function of a read-only transponder, the chip area can be minimised,
thus achieving low power consumption, and a low manufacturing cost.
Read-only systems are operated at all frequencies available to RFID systems. The achievable
ranges are generally very high thanks to the low power consumption of the microchip. Read-
only systems are used where only a small amount of data is required or where they can replace the
functionality of barcode systems, for example in the control of product ﬂows, in the identiﬁcation of
pallets, containers and gas bottles (ISO 18000), but also in the identiﬁcation of animals (ISO 11785).
• The mid-range is occupied by a variety of systems with writable data memory, which means
that this sector has by far the greatest diversity of types. Memory sizes range from a few
bytes to over 100 Kbyte EEPROM (passive transponder) or SRAM (active, i.e. transponder with
battery backup). These transponders are able to process simple reader commands for the selective
reading and writing of the data memory in a permanently encoded state machine. In general,
the transponders also support anticollision procedures, so that several transponders located in
the reader’s interrogation zone at the same time do not interfere with one another and can be
selectively addressed by the reader (see Section 7.2).
Cryptological procedures, i.e. authentication between transponder and reader, and data stream
encryption (see Chapter 8) are also common in these systems. These systems are operated at
all frequencies available to RFID systems. The high-end segment is made up of systems with a

25
microprocessor and a smart card operating system (smart card OS). The use of microprocessors
facilitates the realisation of signiﬁcantly more complex encryption and authentication algorithms
than would be possible using the hard-wired logic of a state machine. The top end of high-end
systems is occupied by modern dual interface smart cards (see Section 10.2.1), which have a
cryptographic coprocessor. The enormous reduction in computing times that results from the use
of a coprocessor means that contactless smart cards can even be used in applications that impose
high requirements on the secure encryption of the data transmission, such as electronic purse
or ticketing systems for public transport. High-end systems are almost exclusively operated at
the 13.56 MHz frequency. Data transmission between transponder and reader is described in the
standard ISO 14443.
2.6
Selection Criteria for RFID Systems
There has been an enormous upsurge in the popularity of RFID systems in recent years. The best
example of this phenomenon is the contactless smart cards used as electronic tickets for public
transport. Five years ago it was inconceivable that tens of millions of contactless tickets would
now be in use. The possible ﬁelds of application for contactless identiﬁcation systems have also
multiplied recently.
Developers of RFID systems have taken this development into account, with the result that
countless systems are now available on the market. The technical parameters of these systems are
optimised for various ﬁelds of application – ticketing, animal identiﬁcation, industrial automation
or access control. The technical requirements of these ﬁelds of application often overlap, which
means that the clear classiﬁcation of suitable systems is no simple matter. To make matters more

difﬁcult, apart from a few special cases (animal identiﬁcation, close-coupling smart cards), no
binding standards are as yet in place for RFID systems.
It is difﬁcult even for a specialist to retain an overview of the range of RFID systems currently
on offer. Therefore, it is not always easy for users to select the system best suited to their needs.
In what follows there are some points for consideration when selecting RFID systems.
2.6.1
Operating Frequency
RFID systems that use frequencies between approximately 100 kHz and 30 MHz operate using
inductive coupling. By contrast, microwave systems in the frequency range 2.45–5.8 GHz are
coupled using electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The speciﬁc absorption rate (damping) for water or nonconductive substances is lower by a
factor of 100 000 at 100 kHz than it is at 1 GHz. Therefore, virtually no absorption or damping
takes place. Lower-frequency RF systems are primarily used due to the better penetration of objects
(Sch¨urmann, 1994). An example of this is the bolus, a transponder placed in the omasum (rumen)
of cattle, which can be read from outside at an interrogation frequency of <135 kHz.
Microwave systems have a signiﬁcantly higher range than inductive systems, typically 2–15 m.
However, in contrast to inductive systems, microwave systems require an additional backup battery.
The transmission power of the reader is generally insufﬁcient to supply enough power for the
operation of the transponder.
Another important factor is sensitivity to electromagnetic interference ﬁelds, such as those gen-
erated by welding robots or strong electric motors. Inductive transponders are at a signiﬁcant
disadvantage here. Microwave systems have therefore particularly established themselves in the
production lines and painting systems of the automotive industry. Other factors are the high mem-
ory capacity (up to 32 Kbyte) and the high temperature resistance (up to 250 ◦C) of microwave
systems (Bachthaler, 1997).
2.6.2
Range
The required range of an application is dependent upon several factors:
• the positional accuracy of the transponder;
• the minimum distance between several transponders in practical operation;
• the speed of the transponder in the interrogation zone of the reader.
For example, in contactless payment applications – e.g. public transport tickets – the positioning
speed is very low, since the transponder is guided to the reader by hand. The minimum distance
between several transponders in this case corresponds to the distance between two passengers
entering a vehicle. For such systems there is an optimal range of 5–10 cm. A greater range would
only give rise to problems in this case, since several passengers’ tickets might be detected by
the reader simultaneously. This would make it impossible to allocate the ticket reliably to the
correct passenger.
Different vehicle models of varying dimensions are often constructed simultaneously on the
production lines of the automotive industry. Thus great variations in the distance between the
transponder on the vehicle and the reader are pre-programmed (Bachthaler, 1997). The write/read
distance of the RFID system used must therefore be designed for the maximum required range.
The distance between the transponders must be such that only one transponder is ever within the
interrogation zone of the reader at a time. In this situation, microwave systems in which the ﬁeld
has a directional beam offer clear advantages over the broad, nondirectional ﬁelds of inductively
coupled systems.

Comparison of the relative interrogation zones of different systems
The speed of transponders, relative to readers, together with the maximum write/read distance,
determines the length of time spent in the reader’s interrogation zone. For the identiﬁcation of
vehicles, the required range of the RFID system is designed such that, at the maximum vehicle
speed, the length of time spent in the interrogation zone is sufﬁcient for the transmission of the
required data.
2.6.3
Security Requirements
Security requirements to be imposed on a planned RFID application, i.e. encryption and authen-
tication, should be assessed very precisely to rule out any nasty surprises in the implementation
phase. For this purpose, the incentive that the system represents to a potential attacker as a means
of procuring money or material goods by manipulation should be evaluated. In order to be able to
assess this attraction, we divide applications into two groups:
• industrial or closed applications;
• public applications connected with money and material goods.
This can be illustrated on the basis of two contrasting application examples. Let us once again
consider an assembly line in the automotive industry as a typical example of an industrial or
closed application. Only authorised persons have access to this RFID system, so the circle of
potential attackers remains reasonably small. A malicious attack on the system by the alteration or
falsiﬁcation of the data on a transponder could bring about a critical malfunction in the operating
sequence, but the attacker would not gain any personal beneﬁt. The probability of an attack can thus
be set equal to zero, meaning that even a cheap low-end system without security logic can be used.
Our second example is a ticketing system for use in public transport. Such a system, primarily
data carriers in the form of contactless smart cards, is accessible to anyone. The circle of potential
attackers is thus enormous. A successful attack on such a system could represent large-scale ﬁnancial

28
RFID Handbook
damage to the public transport company in question, for example in the event of the organised
sale of falsiﬁed travel passes, to say nothing of the damage to the company’s image. For such
applications a high-end transponder with authentication and encryption procedures is indispensable.
For applications with maximum security requirements, for example banking applications with an
electronic purse, only transponders with microprocessors should be used.
2.6.4
Memory Capacity
The chip size of the data carrier – and thus the price class – is primarily determined by its memory
capacity. Therefore, permanently encoded read-only data carriers are used in price-sensitive mass
applications with a low local information requirement. However, only the identity of an object can
be deﬁned using such a data carrier. Further data is stored in the central database of the controlling
computer. If data is to be written back to the transponder, a transponder with EEPROM or RAM
memory technology is required.
EEPROM memories are primarily found in inductively coupled systems. Memory capacities of
16 bytes to 8 Kbytes are available. SRAM memory devices with a battery backup, on the other
hand, are predominantly used in microwave systems. The memory capacities on offer range from
256 bytes to 64 Kbytes.

Fundamental Operating Principles
This chapter describes the basic interaction between transponder and reader, in particular the power
supply to the transponder and the data transfer between transponder and reader (Figure 3.1). For a
more in-depth description of the physical interactions and mathematical models relating to inductive
coupling or backscatter systems please refer to Chapter 4.
3.1
1-Bit Transponder
A bit is the smallest unit of information that can be represented and has only two states: 1 and 0.
This means that only two states can be represented by systems based upon a 1-bit transponder:
‘transponder in interrogation zone’ and ‘no transponder in interrogation zone’. Despite this lim-
itation, 1-bit transponders are very widespread – their main ﬁeld of application is in electronic
anti-theft devices in shops (EAS, electronic article surveillance).
An EAS system is made up of the following components: the antenna of a ‘reader’ or inter-
rogator, the security element or tag, and an optional deactivation device for deactivating the tag
after payment. In modern systems deactivation takes place when the price code is registered at the
till. Some systems also incorporate an activator, which is used to reactivate the security element
after deactivation (Gillert, 1997). The main performance characteristic for all systems is the recog-
nition or detection rate in relation to the gate width (maximum distance between transponder and
interrogator antenna).
The procedure for the inspection and testing of installed article surveillance systems is speci-
ﬁed in the guideline VDI 4470 entitled ‘Anti-theft systems for goods – detection gates. Inspection
guidelines for customers’. This guideline contains deﬁnitions and testing procedures for the calcu-
lation of the detection rate and false alarm ratio. It can be used by the retail trade as the basis for
sales contracts or for monitoring the performance of installed systems on an ongoing basis. For the
product manufacturer, the ’Inspection guidelines for customers’ represents an effective benchmark
in the development and optimisation of integrated solutions for security projects (in accordance
with VDI 4470).
3.1.1
Radio Frequency
The radio frequency (RF) procedure is based upon LC resonant circuits adjusted to a deﬁned reso-
nant frequency fR. Early versions employed inductive resistors made of wound enamelled copper
wire with a soldered on capacitor in a plastic housing (hard tag). Modern systems employ coils

etched between foils in the form of stick-on labels. To ensure that the damping resistance does not
become too high and reduce the quality of the resonant circuit to an unacceptable level, the thickness
of the aluminium conduction tracks on the 25-µm-thick polyethylene foil must be at least 50 µm
(J¨orn, 1994). Intermediate foils of 10 µm thickness are used to manufacture the capacitor plates.
The reader (detector) generates a magnetic alternating ﬁeld in the radio frequency range
(Figure 3.2). If the LC resonant circuit is moved into the vicinity of the magnetic alternating ﬁeld,
energy from the alternating ﬁeld can be induced in the resonant circuit via its coils (Faraday’s
law). If the frequency fG of the alternating ﬁeld corresponds with the resonant frequency fR
of the LC resonant circuit the resonant circuit produces a sympathetic oscillation. The current

that ﬂows in the resonant circuit as a result of this acts against its cause, i.e. it acts against the
external magnetic alternating ﬁeld (see Section 4.1.10.1). This effect is noticeable as a result of a
small change in the voltage drop across the transmitter’s generator coil and ultimately leads to a
weakening of the measurable magnetic ﬁeld strength. A change to the induced voltage can also
be detected in an optional sensor coil as soon as a resonant oscillating circuit is brought into the
magnetic ﬁeld of the generator coil.
The relative magnitude of this dip is dependent upon the gap between the two coils (generator
coil – security element, security element – sensor coil) and the quality Q of the induced resonant
circuit (in the security element).
The relative magnitude of the changes in voltage at the generator and sensor coils is generally
very low and thus difﬁcult to detect. However, the signal should be as clear as possible so that the
security element can be reliably detected. This is achieved using a bit of a trick: the frequency of
the magnetic ﬁeld generated is not constant, it is ‘swept’. This means that the generator frequency
continuously crosses the range between minimum and maximum. The frequency range available to
the swept systems is 8.2 MHz ± 10% (J¨orn, 1994).
Whenever the swept generator frequency exactly corresponds with the resonant frequency of the
resonant circuit (in the transponder), the transponder begins to oscillate, producing a clear dip in the
voltages at the generator and sensor coils (Figure 3.3). Frequency tolerances of the security element,
which depend upon manufacturing tolerances and vary in the presence of a metallic environment,
no longer play a role as a result of the ‘scanning’ of the entire frequency range.
Because the tags are not removed at the till, they must be altered so that they do not activate
the anti-theft system. To achieve this, the cashier places the protected product into a device – the
deactivator – that generates a sufﬁciently high magnetic ﬁeld that the induced voltage destroys the
foil capacitor of the transponder. The capacitors are designed with intentional short-circuit points,
so-called dimples. The breakdown of the capacitors is irreversible and detunes the resonant circuit
to such a degree that this can no longer be excited by the sweep signal.
Large-area frame antennas are used to generate the required magnetic alternating ﬁeld in the
detection area. The frame antennas are integrated into columns and combined to form gates. The
classic design that can be seen in every large department store is illustrated in Figure 3.4. Gate
widths of up to 2 m can be achieved using the RF procedure. The relatively low detection rate
of 70% (Gillert, 1997) is disproportionately inﬂuenced by certain product materials. Metals in

particular (e.g. food tins) affect the resonant frequency of the tags and the coupling to the detector
coil and thus have a negative effect on the detection rate. Tags of 50 × 50 mm must be used to
achieve the gate width and detection rate mentioned above.
The range of products that have their own resonant frequencies (e.g. cable drums) presents a great
challenge for system manufacturers. If these resonant frequencies lie within the sweep frequency
8.2 MHz ± 10% they will always trigger false alarms.
3.1.2
Microwaves
EAS systems in the microwave range exploit the generation of harmonics at components with
nonlinear characteristic lines (e.g. diodes). The harmonic of a sinusoidal voltage A with a deﬁned
frequency fA is a sinusoidal voltage B, whose frequency fB is an integer multiple of the fre-
quency fA. The subharmonics of the frequency fA are thus the frequencies 2fA, 3fA, 4fA etc. The
Nth multiple of the output frequency is termed the Nth harmonic (Nth harmonic wave) in radio
engineering; the output frequency itself is termed the carrier wave or ﬁrst harmonic.
In principle, every two-terminal network with a nonlinear characteristic generates harmonics
at the ﬁrst harmonic. In the case of nonlinear resistances, however, energy is consumed, so that
only a small part of the ﬁrst harmonic power is converted into the harmonic oscillation. Under
favourable conditions, the multiplication of f to n × f occurs with an efﬁciency of η = 1/n2.
However, if nonlinear energy storage is used for multiplication, then in the ideal case there are no
losses (Fleckner, 1987).
Capacitance diodes are particularly suitable nonlinear energy stores for frequency multiplication.
The number and intensity of the harmonics that are generated depend upon the capacitance diode’s
dopant proﬁle and characteristic line gradient. The exponent n (also γ) is a measure for the gradient
(= capacitance–voltage characteristic). For simple diffused diodes, this is 0.33 (e.g. BA110), for
alloyed diodes it is 0.5 and for tuner diodes with a hyper-abrupt P–N junction it is around 0.75
(e.g. BB 141; ITT, 1975).
The capacitance–voltage characteristic of alloyed capacitance diodes has a quadratic path and is
therefore best suited for the doubling of frequencies. Simple diffused diodes can be used to produce
higher harmonics (Fleckner, 1987).
The layout of a 1-bit transponder for the generation of harmonics is extremely simple: a capaci-
tance diode is connected to the base of a dipole adjusted to the carrier wave (Figure 3.5). Given a
carrier wave frequency of 2.45 GHz the dipole has a total length of 6 cm. The carrier wave frequen-
cies used are 915 MHz (outside Europe), 2.45 GHz or 5.6 GHz. If the transponder is located within
the transmitter’s range, then the ﬂow of current within the diode generates and re-emits harmonics
of the carrier wave. Particularly distinctive signals are obtained at two or three times the carrier
wave, depending upon the type of diode used.

Transponders of this type cast in plastic (hard tags) are used mainly to protect textiles. The tags
are removed at the till when the goods are paid for and they are subsequently reused.
Figure 3.6 shows a transponder being placed within the range of a microwave transmitter oper-
ating at 2.45 GHz. The second harmonic of 4.90 GHz generated in the diode characteristic of the
transponder is retransmitted and detected by a receiver, which is adjusted to this precise frequency.
The reception of a signal at the frequency of the second harmonic can then trigger an alarm system.
If the amplitude or frequency of the carrier wave is modulated (ASK, FSK), then all harmonics
incorporate the same modulation. This can be used to distinguish between ‘interference’ and ‘useful’
signals, preventing false alarms caused by external signals. In the example above, the amplitude of
the carrier wave is modulated with a signal of 1 kHz (100% ASK). The second harmonic generated at
the transponder is also modulated at 1 kHz ASK. The signal received at the receiver is demodulated
and forwarded to a 1 kHz detector. Interference signals that happen to be at the reception frequency
of 4.90 GHz cannot trigger false alarms because these are not normally modulated and, if they are,
they will have a different modulation.
3.1.3
Frequency Divider
This procedure operates in the longwave range at 100–135.5 kHz. The security tags contain a
semiconductor circuit (microchip) and a resonant circuit coil made of wound enamelled copper.
The resonant circuit is made to resonate at the operating frequency of the EAS system using a
soldered capacitor. These transponders can be obtained in the form of hard tags (plastic) and are
removed when goods are purchased.

The microchip in the transponder receives its power supply from the magnetic ﬁeld of the
security device (see Section 3.2.1.1). The frequency at the self-inductive coil is divided by two by
the microchip and sent back to the security device. The signal at half the original frequency is fed
by a tap into the resonant circuit coil.
The magnetic ﬁeld of the security device is pulsed at a lower frequency (ASK modulated)
to improve the detection rate. Similarly to the procedure for the generation of harmonics, the
modulation of the carrier wave (ASK or FSK) is maintained at half the frequency (subharmonic).
This is used to differentiate between ‘interference’ and ‘useful’ signals. This system almost entirely
rules out false alarms.
Frame antennas, similar to those known from RF systems, are used as sensor antennas.
3.1.4
Electromagnetic Types
Electromagnetic types operate using strong magnetic ﬁelds in the NF range from 10 Hz to around
20 kHz. The security elements contain a soft magnetic amorphous metal strip with a steep-ﬂanked
hysteresis curve (see also Section 4.1.12). The magnetisation of these strips is periodically reversed
and the strips taken to magnetic saturation by a strong magnetic alternating ﬁeld. The markedly
nonlinear relationship between the applied ﬁeld strength H and the magnetic ﬂux density B near
saturation (see also Figure 4.52), plus the sudden change of ﬂux density B in the vicinity of the
zero crossover of the applied ﬁeld strength H, generates harmonics at the basic frequency of the
security device, and these harmonics can be received and evaluated by the security device.
The electromagnetic type is optimised by superimposing additional signal sections with higher
frequencies over the main signal. The marked nonlinearity of the strip’s hysteresis curve generates
not only harmonics, but also signal sections with summation and differential frequencies of the

supplied signals. Given a main signal of frequency fS = 20 Hz and the additional signals f1 = 3.5
and f2 = 5.3 kHz, the following signals are generated (ﬁrst order):
f1 + f2 = f1+2 = 8.80 kHz
f1 −f2 = f1−2 = 1.80 kHz
fS + f1 = fS+1 = 3.52 kHz and so on
The security device does not react to the harmonic of the basic frequency in this case, but rather
to the summation or differential frequency of the extra signals.
The tags are available in the form of self-adhesive strips with lengths ranging from a few
centimetres to 20 cm. Due to the extremely low operating frequency, electromagnetic systems
are the only systems suitable for products containing metal. However, these systems have the
disadvantage that the function of the tags is dependent upon position: for reliable detection the
magnetic ﬁeld lines of the security device must run vertically through the amorphous metal strip.
For deactivation, the tags are coated with a layer of hard magnetic metal or partially covered
by hard magnetic plates. At the till the cashier runs a strong permanent magnet along the metal
strip to deactivate the security elements (Plotzke et al., 1994). This magnetises the hard magnetic
metal plates. The metal strips are designed such that the remanence ﬁeld strength of the plate
(see Section 4.1.12) is sufﬁcient to keep the amorphous metal strips at saturation point so that the
magnetic alternating ﬁeld of the security system can no longer be activated.
The tags can be reactivated at any time by demagnetisation. The process of deactivation and
reactivation can be performed any number of times. For this reason, electromagnetic goods protec-
tion systems were originally used mainly in lending libraries. Because the tags are small (minimum
32 mm strips) and cheap, these systems are now being used increasingly in the grocery industry
(Figure 3.9).
In order to achieve the ﬁeld strength necessary for demagnetisation of the permalloy strips, the
ﬁeld is generated by two coil systems in the columns at either side of a narrow passage. Several
individual coils, typically 9 to 12, are located in the two pillars, and these generate weak magnetic
ﬁelds in the centre and stronger magnetic ﬁelds on the outside (Plotzke et al., 1994). Gate widths
of up to 1.50 m can now be realised using this method, while still achieving detection rates of 70%
(Gillert, 1997).

3.1.5
Acoustomagnetic
Acoustomagnetic systems for security elements consist of extremely small plastic boxes around
40 mm long, 8–14 mm wide, depending upon design, and just 1 mm high. The boxes contain two
metal strips, a hard magnetic metal strip permanently connected to the plastic box, plus a strip made
of amorphous metal, positioned such that it is free to vibrate mechanically (Zechbauer, 1999).
Ferromagnetic metals (nickel, iron etc.) change slightly in length in a magnetic ﬁeld under
the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld strength H. This effect is called magnetostriction and results from a
small change in the interatomic distance as a result of magnetisation. In a magnetic alternating
ﬁeld a magnetostrictive metal strip vibrates in the longitudinal direction at the frequency of the
ﬁeld. The amplitude of the vibration is especially high if the frequency of the magnetic alternating
ﬁeld corresponds with that of the (acoustic) resonant frequency of the metal strip. This effect is
particularly marked in amorphous materials.
The decisive factor is that the magnetostrictive effect is also reversible. This means that an
oscillating magnetostrictive metal strip emits a magnetic alternating ﬁeld. Acoustomagnetic security
systems are designed such that the frequency of the magnetic alternating ﬁeld generated precisely
coincides with the resonant frequencies of the metal strips in the security element. The amorphous
metal strip begins to oscillate under the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld. If the magnetic alternating
ﬁeld is switched off after some time, the excited magnetic strip continues to oscillate for a while,
like a tuning fork, and thereby itself generates a magnetic alternating ﬁeld that can easily be detected
by the security system.
The great advantage of this procedure is that the security system is not itself transmitting while the
security element is responding and the detection receiver can thus be designed with a corresponding
degree of sensitivity.

In their activated state, acoustomagnetic security elements are magnetised, i.e. the above-
mentioned hard magnetic metal strip has a high remanence ﬁeld strength and thus forms a
permanent magnet. To deactivate the security element the hard magnetic metal strip must be
demagnetised. This detunes the resonant frequency of the amorphous metal strip so it can no
longer be excited by the operating frequency of the security system. The hard magnetic metal
strip can only be demagnetised by a strong magnetic alternating ﬁeld with a slowly decaying ﬁeld
strength. It is thus absolutely impossible for the security element to be manipulated by permanent
magnets brought into the store by customers.
3.2
Full- and Half-Duplex Procedure
In contrast to 1-bit transponders, which normally exploit simple physical effects (oscillation stimu-
lation procedures, stimulation of harmonic processes by the nonlinear characteristic of diodes or the
nonlinear hysteresis curve of metals), the transponders described in this and subsequent sections use
an electronic microchip as the data-carrying device. This has a data storage capacity of between a
few bytes and more than 100 kilobytes. To read from or write to the data-carrying device it must be
possible to transfer data between the reader and the transponder and then back from the transpon-
der to the reader. This transfer takes place according to one of two main procedures: full-duplex
and half-duplex procedures, which are described in this section, and sequential systems, which are
described in the following section.
In the half-duplex procedure (HDX) the data transfer from the transponder to the reader alternates
with data transfer from the reader to the transponder. At frequencies below 30 MHz this is most
often used with the load modulation procedure, either with or without a subcarrier, which involves
very simple circuitry. Closely related to this is the modulated reﬂected cross-section procedure
that is familiar from radar technology and is used at frequencies above 100 MHz. Load modulation
and modulated reﬂected cross-section procedures directly inﬂuence the magnetic or electromagnetic
ﬁeld generated by the reader and belong therefore among the harmonic procedures.
In the full-duplex procedure (FDX) the data transfer from the transponder to the reader (up-link)
takes place at the same time as the data transfer from the reader to the transponder (down-link). This
includes procedures in which data is transmitted from the transponder at a fraction of the frequency
of the reader, i.e. a subharmonic, or at a completely independent, i.e. an anharmonic, frequency.
However, both procedures have in common the fact that the transfer of energy from the reader
to the transponder is continuous, i.e. it is independent of the direction of data ﬂow. In sequential
systems (SEQ), on the other hand, the transfer of energy from the transponder to the reader takes
place for a limited period of time only (pulse operation →pulsed system). Data transfer from the
transponder to the reader occurs in the pauses between the power supply to the transponder.

Unfortunately, the literature relating to RFID has not yet been able to agree a consistent nomen-
clature for these system variants. Rather, there has been a confusing and inconsistent classiﬁcation
of individual systems into full- and half-duplex procedures. Thus pulsed systems are often termed
half-duplex systems – this is correct from the point of view of data transfer – and all unpulsed sys-
tems are falsely classiﬁed as full-duplex systems. For this reason, in this book pulsed systems – for
differentiation from other procedures, and unlike most RFID literature(!) – are termed sequential
systems (SEQ).
3.2.1
Inductive Coupling
3.2.1.1
Power Supply to Passive Transponders
An inductively coupled transponder comprises an electronic data-carrying device, usually a single
microchip, and a large-area coil or conductor loop that functions as an antenna.
Inductively coupled transponders are almost always operated passively. This means that all the
energy needed for the operation of the microchip has to be provided by the reader (Figure 3.13).
For this purpose, the reader’s antenna coil generates a strong, high-frequency electromagnetic
ﬁeld, which penetrates the cross-section of the coil area and the area around the coil. Because the
wavelength of the frequency range used (<135 kHz: 2400 m, 13.56 MHz: 22.1 m) is several times
greater than the distance between the reader’s antenna and the transponder, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld may be treated as a simple magnetic alternating ﬁeld with regard to the distance between
transponder and antenna (see Section 4.2.1.1 for further details).
A small part of the emitted ﬁeld penetrates the antenna coil of the transponder, which is some
distance away from the coil of the reader. A voltage Ui is generated in the transponder’s antenna
coil by inductance. This voltage is rectiﬁed and serves as the power supply for the data-carrying
device (microchip).
A capacitor Cr is connected in parallel with the reader’s antenna coil, the capacitance of this
capacitor being selected such that it works with the coil inductance of the antenna coil to form a

parallel resonant circuit with a resonant frequency that corresponds with the transmission frequency
of the reader. Very high currents can be generated in the antenna coil of the reader by resonance
step-up in the parallel resonant circuit, which can be used to generate the required ﬁeld strengths
for the operation of the remote transponder.
The antenna coil of the transponder and the capacitor C1 form a resonant circuit tuned to the
transmission frequency of the reader. The voltage U at the transponder coil reaches a maximum
due to resonance step-up in the parallel resonant circuit.
The layout of the two coils can also be interpreted as a transformer (transformer coupling), in
which case there is only a very weak coupling between the two windings. The efﬁciency of power
transfer between the antenna coil of the reader and the transponder is proportional to the operating

the two coils relative to each other and the distance between the two coils.
As frequency f increases, the required coil inductance of the transponder coil, and thus the
number of windings n decreases (135 kHz: typical 100–1000 windings, 13.56 MHz: typical 3–10
windings). Because the voltage induced in the transponder is still proportional to frequency f (see
Chapter 4), the reduced number of windings barely affects the efﬁciency of power transfer at higher

3.2.1.2
Data Transfer Transponder →Reader
3.2.1.2.1
Load Modulation
As described above, inductively coupled systems are based upon a transformer-type coupling
between the primary coil in the reader and the secondary coil in the transponder. This is true
when the distance between the coils does not exceed (λ/2π) 0.16λ, so that the transponder is
located in the near ﬁeld of the transmitter antenna (for a more detailed deﬁnition of the near and
far ﬁelds, please refer to Section 4.2.1.1).
If a resonant transponder (i.e. a transponder with a self-resonant frequency corresponding with
the transmission frequency of the reader) is placed within the magnetic alternating ﬁeld of the
reader’s antenna, the transponder draws energy from the magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting feedback
of the transponder on the reader’s antenna can be represented as transformed impedance ZT in
the antenna coil of the reader. Switching a load resistor on and off at the transponder’s antenna
therefore brings about a change in the impedance ZT, and thus voltage changes at the reader’s
antenna (see Section 4.1.10.3). This has the effect of an amplitude modulation of the voltage UL
at the reader’s antenna coil by the remote transponder. If the timing with which the load resistor
is switched on and off is controlled by data, this data can be transferred from the transponder to
the reader. This type of data transfer is called load modulation.
To reclaim the data at the reader, the voltage tapped at the reader’s antenna is rectiﬁed. This
represents the demodulation of an amplitude modulated signal. An example circuit is shown in
Section 11.3.1.
If the transponder leaves the near-ﬁeld, i.e. the range < λ/2π(0.16 λ), the transformer coupling
between reader antenna and the transponder antenna will be lost with the transition into the far-ﬁeld.
Therefore, load modulation is not possible any longer in the far-ﬁeld. This does not mean, though,
that data transmission from the transponder to the reader is, in principle, not possible. With the
transition into the far-ﬁeld, the mechanism of the backscatter coupling (see Section 3.2.2) becomes
effective. In practice, data transmission to the reader usually fails because of the low efﬁciency of
the transponder antennas (i.e. the low antenna gain) in the far-ﬁeld.
3.2.1.2.2
Load Modulation with Subcarrier
Due to the weak coupling between the reader antenna and the transponder antenna, the voltage
ﬂuctuations at the antenna of the reader that represent the useful signal are smaller by orders of
magnitude than the output voltage of the reader. In practice, for a 13.56 MHz system, given an
antenna voltage of approximately 100 V (voltage step-up by resonance) a useful signal of around
10 mV can be expected (= 80 dB signal/noise ratio). Because detecting this slight voltage change
requires highly complicated circuitry, the modulation sidebands created by the amplitude modulation
of the antenna voltage are utilised.
If the additional load resistor in the transponder is switched on and off at a very high elementary
frequency fS, then two spectral lines are created at a distance of ±fS around the transmission
frequency of the reader fREADER, and these can be easily detected (however fS must be less
than fREADER). In the terminology of radio technology the new elementary frequency is called a
subcarrier). Data transfer is by ASK, FSK or PSK modulation of the subcarrier in time with the
data ﬂow. This represents an amplitude modulation of the subcarrier.
Load modulation with a subcarrier creates two modulation sidebands at the reader’s antenna at
the distance of the subcarrier frequency around the operating frequency fREADER. These modulation
sidebands can be separated from the signiﬁcantly stronger signal of the reader by bandpass (BP)
ﬁltering on one of the two frequencies fREADER ± fS. Once it has been ampliﬁed, the subcarrier
signal is now very simple to demodulate.

subcarrier frequencies are 212 kHz, 424 kHz (e.g. ISO/IEC 15 693) and 848 kHz (e.g. ISO/IEC
14443).

Figure 3.18 shows an example circuit for a transponder using load modulation with a subcarrier.
The circuit is designed for an operating frequency of 13.56 MHz and generates a subcarrier of
212 kHz.
The voltage induced at the antenna coil L1 by the magnetic alternating ﬁeld of the reader is
rectiﬁed using the bridge rectiﬁer (D1–D4) and after additional smoothing (C1) is available to the
circuit as supply voltage. The parallel regulator (ZD 5V6) prevents the supply voltage from being
subject to an uncontrolled increase when the transponder approaches the reader antenna.

Example circuit for the generation of load modulation with subcarrier in an inductively coupled
transponder
Part of the high frequency antenna voltage (13.56 MHz) travels to the frequency divider’s timing
input (CLK) via the protective resistor (R1) and provides the transponder with the basis for the
generation of an internal clocking signal. After division by 26(= 64) a subcarrier clocking signal
of 212 kHz is available at output Q7. The subcarrier clocking signal, controlled by a serial data
ﬂow at the data input (DATA), is passed to the switch (T1). If there is a logical HIGH signal at
the data input (DATA), then the subcarrier clocking signal is passed to the switch (T1). The load
resistor (R2) is then switched on and off in time with the subcarrier frequency.
Optionally in the circuit depicted, the transponder resonant circuit can be brought into resonance
with the capacitor C1 at 13.56 MHz. The range of this ‘minimal transponder’ can be signiﬁcantly
increased in this manner.
3.2.1.2.4
Subharmonic Procedure
The subharmonic of a sinusoidal voltage A with a deﬁned frequency fA is a sinusoidal voltage B,
whose frequency fB is derived from an integer division of the frequency fA. The subharmonics of
the frequency fA are therefore the frequencies fA/2, fA/3, fA/4 . . . .
In the subharmonic transfer procedure, a second frequency fB, which is usually lower by a factor
of two, is derived by digital division by two of the reader’s transmission frequency fA. The output
signal fB of a binary divider can now be modulated with the data stream from the transponder.
The modulated signal is then fed back into the transponder’s antenna via an output driver.
One popular operating frequency for subharmonic systems is 128 kHz. This gives rise to a
transponder response frequency of 64 kHz.
The transponder’s antenna consists of a coil with a central tap, whereby the power supply is taken
from one end. The transponder’s return signal is fed into the coil’s second connection (Figure 3.19).

RFID systems in which the gap between reader and transponder is greater than 1 m are called
long-range systems. These systems are operated at the UHF frequencies of 868 MHz (Europe)
and 915 MHz (USA), and at the microwave frequencies 2.5 and 5.8 GHz. The short wavelengths

Basic circuit of a transponder with subharmonic back frequency. The received clocking signal
is split into two, the data is modulated and fed into the transponder coil via a tap
of these frequency ranges facilitate the construction of antennas with far smaller dimensions and
greater efﬁciency than would be possible using frequency ranges below 30 MHz.
In order to be able to assess the energy available for the operation of a transponder we ﬁrst
calculate the free space path loss aF in relation to the distance r between the transponder and
the reader’s antenna, the gain GT and GR of the transponder’s and reader’s antenna, plus the
transmission frequency f of the reader:
aF = −147.6 + 20 log(r) + 20 log(f ) −10 log(GT) −10 log(GR)
(3.1)
The free space path loss is a measure of the relationship between the RF power emitted by a
reader into ‘free space’ and the RF power received by the transponder.
Using current low-power semiconductor technology, transponder chips can be produced with
a power consumption of no more than 5 µW (Friedrich and Annala, 2001). The efﬁciency of an
integrated rectiﬁer can be assumed to be 5–25% in the UHF and microwave range (Tanneberger,
1995). Given an efﬁciency of 10%, we thus require received power of Pe = 50 µW at the terminal
of the transponder antenna for the operation of the transponder chip. This means that where the
reader’s transmission power is Ps = 0.5 W EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) the free space
path loss may not exceed 40 dB (Ps/Pe = 10 000/1) if sufﬁciently high power is to be obtained at
the transponder antenna for the operation of the transponder. A glance at Table 3.7 shows that at a
transmission frequency of 868 MHz a range of a little over 3 m would be realisable; at 2.45 GHz
a little over 1 m could be achieved. If the transponder’s chip had a greater power consumption the
achievable range would fall accordingly.
In order to achieve long ranges of up to 15 m or to be able to operate transponder chips with a
greater power consumption at an acceptable range, backscatter transponders often have a backup bat-
tery to supply power to the transponder chip (Figure 3.20). To prevent this battery from being loaded
unnecessarily, the microchips generally have a power saving ‘power down’ or ‘standby’ mode.

Active transponder for the frequency range 2.45 GHz. The data carrier is supplied with power
by two lithium batteries. The transponder’s microwave antenna is visible on the printed circuit board in the
form of a U-shaped area (reproduced by permission of Pepperl & Fuchs, Mannheim)
If the transponder moves out of range of a reader, then the chip automatically switches over to the
power-saving ‘power down’ mode. In this state the power consumption is a few µA at most. The
chip is not reactivated until a sufﬁciently strong signal is received in the read range of a reader,
whereupon it switches back to normal operation. However, the battery of an active transponder
never provides power for the transmission of data between transponder and reader, but serves
exclusively for the supply of the microchip. Data transmission between transponder and reader
relies exclusively upon the power of the electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted by the reader.

Modulated Reﬂection Cross-Section
We know from the ﬁeld of radar technology that electromagnetic waves are reﬂected by objects
with dimensions greater than around half the wavelength of the wave. The efﬁciency with which
an object reﬂects electromagnetic waves is described by its reﬂection cross-section. Objects that
are in resonance with the wavefront that hits them, as is the case for antennas at the appropriate
frequency, for example, have a particularly large reﬂection cross-section.
Power P1 is emitted from the reader’s antenna, a small proportion of which (free space atten-
uation) reaches the transponder’s antenna (Figure 3.21). The power P ′
1 is supplied to the antenna
connections as RF voltage and after rectiﬁcation by the diodes D1 and D2 this can be used as
turn-on voltage for the deactivation or activation of the power saving ‘power down’ mode. The
diodes used here are low-barrier Schottky diodes, which have a particularly low threshold voltage.
The voltage obtained may also be sufﬁcient to serve as a power supply for short ranges.

Operating principle of a backscatter transponder. The impedance of the chip is ‘modulated’ by
switching the chip’s FET (reproduced by permission of Integrated Silicon Design Pty, Ltd)
A proportion of the incoming power P ′
1 is reﬂected by the antenna and returned as power P2. The
reﬂection characteristics (= reﬂection cross-section) of the antenna can be inﬂuenced by altering
the load connected to the antenna. In order to transmit data from the transponder to the reader, a
load resistor RL connected in parallel with the antenna is switched on and off in time with the data
stream to be transmitted. The amplitude of the power P2 reﬂected from the transponder can thus
be modulated (modulated backscatter).
The power P2 reﬂected from the transponder is radiated into free space. A small proportion of
this (free space attenuation) is picked up by the reader’s antenna. The reﬂected signal therefore
travels into the antenna connection of the reader in the backwards direction and can be decoupled
using a directional coupler and transferred to the receiver input of a reader. The forward signal
of the transmitter, which is stronger by powers of ten, is to a large degree suppressed by the
directional coupler.
The ratio of power transmitted by the reader and power returning from the transponder (P1/P2)
can be estimated using the radar equation (for an explanation, refer to Chapter 4).
3.2.3
Close-Coupling
3.2.3.1
Power Supply to the Transponder
Close coupling systems are designed for ranges between 0.1 cm and a maximum of 1 cm. The
transponder is therefore inserted into the reader or placed onto a marked surface (‘touch and go’)
for operation.
Inserting the transponder into the reader, or placing it on the reader, allows the transponder coil
to be precisely positioned in the air gap of a ring-shaped or U-shaped core. The functional layout
of the transponder coil and reader coil corresponds with that of a transformer (Figure 3.22). The
reader represents the primary winding and the transponder coil represents the secondary winding
of a transformer. A high-frequency alternating current in the primary winding generates a high-
frequency magnetic ﬁeld in the core and air gap of the arrangement, which also ﬂows through the
transponder coil. This power is rectiﬁed to provide a power supply to the chip.
Because the voltage U induced in the transponder coil is proportional to the frequency f of
the exciting current, the frequency selected for power transfer should be as high as possible. In
practice, frequencies in the range 1–10 MHz are used. In order to keep the losses in the trans-
former core low, a ferrite material that is suitable for this frequency must be selected as the
core material.
Because, in contrast to inductively coupled or microwave systems, the efﬁciency of power
transfer from reader to transponder is very good, close-coupling systems are excellently suited for

The mechanical and electrical parameters of contactless close-coupling chip cards are deﬁned in
their own standard, ISO 10536. For other designs the operating parameters can be freely deﬁned.

Magnetic Coupling
Load modulation with subcarrier is also used for magnetically coupled data transfer from the
transponder to the reader in close-coupling systems. Subcarrier frequency and modulation is spec-
iﬁed in ISO 10536 for close-coupling chip cards.
3.2.3.2.2
Capacitive Coupling
Due to the short distance between the reader and transponder, close-coupling systems may also
employ capacitive coupling for data transmission. Plate capacitors are constructed from coupling
surfaces isolated from one another, and these are arranged in the transponder and reader such that
when a transponder is inserted they are exactly parallel to one another.
This procedure is also used in close-coupling smart cards. The mechanical and electrical char-
acteristics of these cards are deﬁned in ISO/IEC 10536.
3.2.4
Data Transfer Reader →Transponder
All known digital modulation procedures are used in data transfer from the reader to the transponder
in full- and half-duplex systems, irrespective of the operating frequency or the coupling procedure.
There are three basic procedures:
• ASK: amplitude shift keying
• FSK: frequency shift keying
• PSK: phase shift keying
Because of the simplicity of demodulation, the majority of systems use ASK modulation.

3.2.5.1
Power Supply of Passive Transponders
In electrically (i.e. capacitively) coupled systems the reader generates a strong, high-frequency
electrical ﬁeld. The reader’s antenna consists of a large, electrically conductive area (electrode),
generally a metal foil or a metal plate. If a high-frequency voltage is applied to the electrode a
high-frequency electric ﬁeld forms between the electrode and the earth potential (ground). The
voltages required for this, ranging between a few hundred volts and a few thousand volts, are
generated in the reader by voltage rise in a resonant circuit made up of a coil L1 in the reader, plus
the parallel connection of an internal capacitor C1 and the capacitance active between the electrode
and the earth potential CR-GND. The resonant frequency of the resonant circuit corresponds with
the transmission frequency of the reader.
The antenna of the transponder is made up of two conductive surfaces lying in a plane
(electrodes). If the transponder is placed within the electrical ﬁeld of the reader, then an electric
voltage arises between the two transponder electrodes, which is used to supply power to the
transponder chips.
Since a capacitor is active both between the transponder and the transmission antenna (CR-T) and
between the transponder antenna and the earth potential (CT-GND) the equivalent circuit diagram for
an electrical coupling can be considered in a simpliﬁed form as a voltage divider with the elements
CR-T, RL (input resistance of the transponder) and CT-GND (see Figure 3.26). Touching one of the
transponder’s electrodes results in the capacitance CT-GND, and thus also the read range, becoming
signiﬁcantly greater.
The currents that ﬂow in the electrode surfaces of the transponder are very small. Therefore, no
particular requirements are imposed upon the conductivity of the electrode material. In addition to
the normal metal surfaces (metal foil) the electrodes can thus also be made of conductive colours
(e.g. a silver conductive paste) or a graphite coating (Baddeley and Ruiz, 1998).
3.2.5.2
Data Transfer Transponder →Reader
If an electrically coupled transponder is placed within the interrogation zone of a reader, the
input resistance RL of the transponder acts upon the resonant circuit of the reader via the coupling
capacitance CR-T active between the reader and transponder electrodes, damping the resonant circuit
slightly. This damping can be switched between two values by switching a modulation resistor Rmod

an amplitude modulation of the voltage present at L1 and C1 by the remote transponder. By
switching the modulation resistor Rmod on and off in time with data, this data can be transmitted
to the reader. This procedure is called load modulation.
3.3
Sequential Procedures
If the transmission of data and power from the reader to the data carrier alternates with data transfer
from the transponder to the reader, then we speak of a sequential procedure (SEQ).
The characteristics used to differentiate between SEQ and other systems have already been
described in Section 3.2.
3.3.1
Inductive Coupling
3.3.1.1
Power Supply to the Transponder
Sequential systems using inductive coupling are operated exclusively at frequencies below 135 kHz.
A transformer-type coupling is created between the reader’s coil and the transponder’s coil. The
induced voltage generated in the transponder coil by the effect of an alternating ﬁeld from the
reader is rectiﬁed and can be used as a power supply.
In order to achieve higher efﬁciency of data transfer, the transponder frequency must be precisely
matched to that of the reader, and the quality of the transponder coil must be carefully speciﬁed.
For this reason the transponder contains an on-chip trimming capacitor to compensate for resonant
frequency manufacturing tolerances.
However, unlike full- and half-duplex systems, in sequential systems the reader’s transmitter does
not operate on a continuous basis. The energy transferred to the transmitter during the transmission
operation charges up a charging capacitor to provide an energy store. The transponder chip is
switched over to standby or power-saving mode during the charging operation, so that almost all
of the energy received is used to charge up the charging capacitor. After a ﬁxed charging period
the reader’s transmitter is switched off again.
The energy stored in the transponder is used to send a reply to the reader. The minimum
capacitance of the charging capacitor can be calculated from the necessary operating voltage and
the chip’s power consumption:

3.3.1.2
A Comparison between FDX/HDX and SEQ Systems
Figure 3.27 illustrates the different conditions arising from full/half-duplex (FDX/HDX) and sequen-
tial (SEQ) systems.
Because the power supply from the reader to the transponder in full-duplex systems occurs at
the same time as data transfer in both directions, the chip is permanently in operating mode. Power
matching between the transponder antenna (current source) and the chip (current consumer) is
desirable to utilise the transmitted energy optimally. However, if precise power matching is used
only half of the source voltage (= open-circuit voltage of the coil) is available. The only option
for increasing the available operating voltage is to increase the impedance (= load resistance) of
the chip. However, this is the same as decreasing the power consumption.
Therefore the design of full-duplex systems is always a compromise between power matching
(maximum power consumption Pchip at Uchip = 1/2U0) and voltage matching (minimum power
consumption Pchip at maximum voltage Uchip = U0).
The situation is completely different in sequential systems: during the charging process the chip
is in standby or power-saving mode, which means that almost no power is drawn through the chip.
The charging capacitor is fully discharged at the beginning of the charging process and therefore
represents a very low ohmic load for the voltage source (Figure 3.27: start loading). In this state, the

maximum amount of current ﬂows into the charging capacitor, whereas the voltage approaches zero
(= current matching). As the charging capacitor is charged, the charging current starts to decrease
according to an exponential function, and reaches zero when the capacitor is fully charged. The
state of the charged capacitor corresponds with voltage matching at the transponder coil.
This achieves the following advantages for the chip power supply compared to a full/half-duplex
system:
• The full source voltage of the transponder coil is available for the operation of the chip. Thus
the available operating voltage is up to twice that of a comparable full/half-duplex system.
• The energy available to the chip is determined only by the capacitance of the charging capacitor
and the charging period. Both values can (in theory!) be given any required magnitude. In
full/half-duplex systems the maximum power consumption of the chip is ﬁxed by the power
matching point (i.e. by the coil geometry and ﬁeld strength H).
3.3.1.3
Data Transmission Transponder →Reader
In sequential systems a full read cycle consists of two phases, the charging phase and the reading
phase.
The end of the charging phase is detected by an end of burst detector, which monitors the path
of voltage at the transponder coil and thus recognises the moment when the reader ﬁeld is switched
off. At the end of the charging phase an on-chip oscillator, which uses the resonant circuit formed
by the transponder coil as a frequency determining component, is activated. A weak magnetic
alternating ﬁeld is generated by the transponder coil, and this can be received by the reader. This
gives an improved signal-interference distance of typically 20 dB compared with full/half-duplex
systems, which has a positive effect upon the ranges that can be achieved using sequential systems.
The transmission frequency of the transponder corresponds with the resonant frequency of the
transponder coil, which was adjusted to the transmission frequency of the reader when it was
generated.
In order to be able to modulate the RF signal generated in the absence of a power supply, an
additional modulation capacitor is connected in parallel with the resonant circuit in time with the
data ﬂow. The resulting frequency shift keying provides a 2 FSK modulation.
After all the data has been transmitted, the discharge mode is activated to fully discharge the
charging capacitor. This guarantees a safe Power-On-Reset at the start of the next charging cycle.

Surface Acoustic Wave Transponder
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are based upon the piezoelectric effect and on the surface-
related dispersion of elastic (= acoustic) waves at low speed. If an (ionic) crystal is elastically
deformed in a certain direction, surface charges occur, giving rise to electrical voltages in the
crystal (application: piezo lighter). Conversely, the application of a surface charge to a crystal leads
to an elastic deformation in the crystal grid (application: piezo buzzer). Surface acoustic wave
devices are operated at microwave frequencies, normally in the ISM range 2.45 GHz.
Electroacoustic transducers (interdigital transducers) and reﬂectors can be created using planar
electrode structures on piezoelectric substrates. The normal substrate used for this application is
lithium niobate or lithium tantalate. The electrode structure is created by a photolithographic pro-
cedure, similar to the procedure used in microelectronics for the manufacture of integrated circuits.
Figure 3.30 illustrates the basic layout of a surface wave transponder. A ﬁnger-shaped electrode
structure – the interdigital transducer – is positioned at the end of a long piezoelectric substrate,
and a suitable dipole antenna for the operating frequency is attached to its busbar. The interdigital
transducer is used to convert between electrical signals and acoustic surface waves. An electrical
impulse applied to the busbar causes a mechanical deformation to the surface of the substrate due
to the piezoelectric effect between the electrodes (ﬁngers), which disperses in both directions in the
form of a surface wave (Rayleigh wave). For a normal substrate the dispersion speed lies between
3000 and 4000 m/s. Similarly, a surface wave entering the converter creates an electrical impulse
at the busbar of the interdigital transducer due to the piezoelectric effect.
Individual electrodes are positioned along the remaining length of the surface wave transponder.
The edges of the electrodes form a reﬂective strip and reﬂect a small proportion of the incoming
surface waves. Reﬂector strips are normally made of aluminium; however some reﬂector strips are
also in the form of etched grooves (Meinke, 1992).
A high-frequency scanning pulse generated by a reader is supplied from the dipole antenna of
the transponder into the interdigital transducer and is thus converted into an acoustic surface wave,
which ﬂows through the substrate in the longitudinal direction. The frequency of the surface wave
corresponds to the carrier frequency of the sampling pulse (e.g. 2.45 GHz, Figure 3.31). The carrier
frequency of the reﬂected and returned pulse sequence thus corresponds with the transmission
frequency of the sampling pulse. Part of the surface wave is reﬂected off each of the reﬂective
strips that are distributed across the substrate, while the remaining part of the surface wave continues
to travel to the end of the substrate and is absorbed there.
The reﬂected parts of the wave travel back to the interdigital transducer, where they are converted
into a high-frequency pulse sequence and are emitted by the dipole antenna. This pulse sequence

can be received by the reader. The number of pulses received corresponds to the number of
reﬂective strips on the substrate. Likewise, the delay between the individual pulses is proportional
to the spatial distance between the reﬂector strips on the substrate, and so the spatial layout of the
reﬂector strips can represent a binary sequence of digits.
Due to the slow dispersion speed of the surface waves on the substrate the ﬁrst response pulse
is only received by the reader after a dead time of around 1.5 ms after the transmission of the
scanning pulse. This gives decisive advantages for the reception of the pulse.
Reﬂections of the scanning pulse on the metal surfaces of the environment travel back to the
antenna of the reader at the speed of light. A reﬂection over a distance of 100 m to the reader would
arrive at the reader 0.6 ms after emission from the reader’s antenna (travel time there and back,
the signal is damped by >160 dB). Therefore, when the transponder signal returns after 1.5 ms all
reﬂections from the environment of the reader have long since died away, so they cannot lead to
errors in the pulse sequence (Dziggel, 1997).
The data storage capacity and data transfer speed of a surface wave transponder depend upon
the size of the substrate and the realisable minimum distance between the reﬂector strips on
the substrate. In practice, around 16–32 bits are transferred at a data transfer rate of 500 kbit/s
(Siemens, n.d.).
The range of a surface wave system depends mainly upon the transmission power of the scanning
pulse and can be estimated using the radar equation (Chapter 4). At the permissible transmission
power in the 2.45 GHz ISM frequency range a range of 1–2 m can be expected.
3.4
Near-Field Communication (NFC)
At ﬁrst sight, near-ﬁeld communication (NFC) is not an RFID system, but a wireless data interface
between devices, similar to Infrared or the well-known Bluetooth. However, NFC has several
characteristics that are of interest in relation to RFID systems.
Data transmission between two NFC interfaces uses high-frequency magnetic alternating ﬁelds
in the frequency range of 13.56 MHz. The maximum communication range typical for NFC data
transmission is 20 cm because the respective communication counterpart is located in the near-ﬁeld
of the transmitter antenna; therefore the communication is called near-ﬁeld communication.
Figure 3.32 illustrates the physical principle of data transmission between two NFC interfaces.
The NFC interface has a 13.56 MHz transmitter and a 13.56 MHz receiver that are alternately
connected to the antenna. The antenna is designed as a large-surface coil or conductor loop.
For communication between two NFC interfaces, the individual NFC interface can take on dif-
ferent functions, i.e. that of an NFC initiator (master device) or an NFC target (slave device).
Communication is always started by the NFC initiator. In addition, NFC communication distin-
guishes between two different operational modes, the active and the passive mode.
3.4.1
Active Mode
In order to transmit data between two NFC interfaces in active mode, at ﬁrst one of the NFC
interfaces activates its transmitter and thus works as the NFC initiator. The high-frequency current
that ﬂows in the antenna induces an alternating magnetic ﬁeld H which spreads around the antenna
loop. Part of the induced magnetic ﬁeld moves through the antenna loop of the other NFC interface
which is located close by. Then a voltage U is induced in the antenna loop and can be detected by
the receiver of the other NFC interface. If the NFC interface receives signals and the corresponding
commands of an NFC initiator, this NFC interface automatically adopts the roll of an NFC target.
For data transmission between the NFC interfaces, the amplitude of the emitted magnetic alter-
nating ﬁeld is modulated (ASK modulation), similar to the data transmission between RFID reader

and transponder. However, the difference between an NFC target in active mode and an RFID
transponder consists in that the magnetic alternating ﬁeld has to supply the transponder with power
in order to operate the microchip. As opposed to this, the electronic device containing the NFC
interface supplies the interface with power.
The transmission direction is reversed in order to send data from the NFC target to the NFC
initiator. This means that the NFC target activates the transmitter and the NFC initiator switches to
receiving mode. Both NFC interfaces alternately induce magnetic ﬁelds where data is transmitted
from transmitter to receiver only.
3.4.2
Passive Mode
In the passive mode, too, the NFC initiator induces a magnetic alternating ﬁeld for transmitting
data to the NFC target. The ﬁeld’s amplitude is modulated in line with the pulse of the data to
be transmitted (ASK modulation). However, after having transmitted a data block, the ﬁeld is not
interrupted, but continues to be emitted in an unmodulated way. The NFC target now is able to
transmit data to the NFC initiator by generating a load modulation. The load modulation method
is also known from RFID systems.
Using this method for NFC interfaces provides a number of advantages and interesting options
for practical operation. Thus the different rˆoles of the two NFC interfaces within the NFC commu-
nication can be negotiated and changed, at any time. An NFC interface with weak power supply,
e.g. with a low-capacity battery, can negotiate and adopt the rˆole of the NFC target in order to save
power by transmitting data via load modulation.
The NFC interface that is the target is also able to establish, in addition to other NFC interfaces,
the communication to compatible passive transponders (e.g. according to ISO/IEC 14443) that
the NFC target supplies with power and that, via load modulation, can transmit data to the NFC
interface. This option enables electronic devices equipped with NFC interfaces, such as NFC mobile
phones, to read and write on different transponders such as smart labels or e-tickets. As the NFC
interface in this case behaves similar to an RFID reader, this option is also called ‘reader mode’
or ‘reader-emulation mode’.
If an NFC interface is located close to a compatible RFID reader (e.g. according to ISO/IEC
14443), the NFC reader is also able to communicate with a reader. Here, the NFC interface adopts
the roll of an NFC target and can transmit data to the reader using load modulation. This option
enables RFID readers to exchange data with an electronic device with NFC interface, such as NFC
mobile phones. From the reader’s perspective, the electronic device behaves like a contactless smart
card; this option is also called ‘card mode’ or ‘card-emulation mode’.

Physical Principles of RFID
Systems
The vast majority of RFID systems operate according to the principle of inductive coupling. There-
fore, understanding of the procedures of power and data transfer requires a thorough grounding
in the physical principles of magnetic phenomena. This chapter therefore contains a particularly
intensive study of the theory of magnetic ﬁelds from the point of view of RFID.
Electromagnetic ﬁelds – radio waves in the classic sense – are used in RFID systems that operate
at above 30 MHz. To aid understanding of these systems we will investigate the propagation of
waves in the far ﬁeld and the principles of radar technology.
Electric ﬁelds play a secondary role and are only exploited for capacitive data transmission in
close-coupling systems. Therefore, this type of ﬁeld will not be discussed further.

Magnetic Field
4.1.1
Magnetic Field Strength H
Every moving charge (electrons in wires or in a vacuum), i.e. ﬂow of current, is associated with a
magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 4.1). The intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld can be demonstrated experimentally
by the forces acting on a magnetic needle (compass) or a second electric current. The magnitude of
the magnetic ﬁeld is described by the magnetic ﬁeld strength H regardless of the material properties
of the space.
In the general form we can say that: ‘the contour integral of magnetic ﬁeld strength along a
closed curve is equal to the sum of the current strengths of the currents within it’.

We can use this formula to calculate the ﬁeld strength H for different types of conductor.
In a straight conductor the ﬁeld strength H along a circular ﬂux line at a distance r is constant.

4.1.1.1
Path of Field Strength H(x) in Conductor Loops
So-called short cylindrical coils or conductor loops are used as magnetic antennas to generate the
magnetic alternating ﬁeld in the write/read devices of inductively coupled RFID systems.
If the measuring point is moved away from the centre of the coil along the coil axis (x axis),
then the strength of the ﬁeld H will decrease as the distance x is increased. A more in-depth
investigation shows that the ﬁeld strength in relation to the radius (or area) of the coil remains
constant up to a certain distance and then falls rapidly (see Figure 4.4). In free space, the decay
of ﬁeld strength is approximately 60 dB per decade in the near-ﬁeld of the coil, and ﬂattens out
to 20 dB per decade in the far-ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave that is generated (a more precise
explanation of these effects can be found in Section 4.2.1).
The following equation can be used to calculate the path of ﬁeld strength along the x axis of a
round coil (= conductor loop) similar to those employed in the transmitter antennas of inductively
coupled RFID systems (Paul, 1993):
H =
I · N · R2
2

(R2 + x2)3
(4.3)
where N is the number of windings, R is the circle radius r and x is the distance from the centre
of the coil in the x direction. The following boundary condition applies to this equation: d ≪R
and x < λ/2π (the transition into the electromagnetic far ﬁeld begins at a distance >2π; see
Section 4.2.1).
At distance 0 or, in other words, at the centre of the antenna, the formula can be simpliﬁed to
(Kuchling, 1985):
H = I · N
2R
(4.4)
We can calculate the ﬁeld strength path of a rectangular conductor loop with edge length a × b
at a distance of x using the following equation. This format is often used as a transmitter antenna.

Figure 4.4 shows the calculated ﬁeld strength path H(x) for three different antennas at a distance
1 mm–20 m. The number of windings and the antenna current are constant in each case; the antennas
differ only in radius R. The calculation is based upon the following values: H1: R = 55 cm,
H2: R = 7.5 cm, H3: R = 1 cm.

Physical Principles of RFID Systems
65
The calculation results conﬁrm that the increase in ﬁeld strength ﬂattens out at short distances
(x < R) from the antenna coil. Interestingly, the smallest of the three antennas exhibits a signif-
icantly higher ﬁeld strength at the centre of the antenna (distance = 0), but at greater distances
(x > R) the largest of the three antennas generates a signiﬁcantly higher ﬁeld strength. It is vital that
this effect is taken into account in the design of antennas for inductively coupled RFID systems.
4.1.1.2
Optimal Antenna Diameter
If the radius R of the transmitter antenna is varied at a constant distance x from the transmitter
antenna under the simplifying assumption of constant coil current I in the transmitter antenna, then
ﬁeld strength H is found to be at its highest at a certain ratio of distance x to antenna radius R.
This means that for every read range of an RFID system there is an optimal antenna radius R.
This is quickly illustrated by a glance at Figure 4.4: if the selected antenna radius is too great, the
ﬁeld strength is too low, even at a distance x = 0 from the transmission antenna. If, on the other
hand, the selected antenna radius is too small, then we ﬁnd ourselves within the range in which the
ﬁeld strength falls in proportion to x3.
Figure 4.5 shows the graph of ﬁeld strength H as the coil radius R is varied. The optimal coil
radius for different read ranges is always the maximum point of the graph H(R). To ﬁnd the
mathematical relationship between the maximum ﬁeld strength H and the coil radius R we must
ﬁrst ﬁnd the inﬂection point of the function H(R), given by Equation 4.3 (Lee, 1999). To do this
we ﬁnd the ﬁrst derivative H ′(R) by differentiating H(R) with respect to R:
H ′(R) = d

derivative dH/dR:
R1 = x ·

(4.7)
The optimal radius of a transmission antenna is thus twice the maximum desired read range. The
second zero point is negative merely because the magnetic ﬁeld H of a conductor loop propagates
in both directions of the x axis (see also Figure 4.3).
However, an accurate assessment of a system’s maximum read range requires knowledge of the
interrogation ﬁeld strength Hmin of the transponder in question (see Section 4.1.9). If the selected
antenna radius is too great, then there is a danger that the ﬁeld strength H may be too low to
supply the transponder with sufﬁcient operating energy, even at a distance x = 0.
4.1.2
Magnetic Flux and Magnetic Flux Density
The magnetic ﬁeld of a (cylindrical) coil will exert a force on a magnetic needle. If a soft iron
core is inserted into a (cylindrical) coil – all other things remaining equal – then the force acting
on the magnetic needle will increase. The quotient I × N (Section 4.1.1) remains constant and
therefore so does ﬁeld strength. However, the ﬂux density – the total number of ﬂux lines – which
is decisive for the force generated (cf. Paul, 1993), has increased.
The total number of lines of magnetic ﬂux that pass through the inside of a cylindrical coil,
for example, is denoted by magnetic ﬂux . Magnetic ﬂux density B is a further variable related
to area A (this variable is often referred to as ‘magnetic inductance B’ in the literature) (Reichel,
1980). Magnetic ﬂux is expressed as:
 = B · A
(4.8)
The material relationship between ﬂux density B and ﬁeld strength H (Figure 4.6) is expressed
by the material equation:
B = µ0µrH = µH
(4.9)
The constant µ0 is the magnetic ﬁeld constant (µ0 = 4π × 10−6 V s/A m) and describes the
permeability (= magnetic conductivity) of a vacuum. The variable µr is called relative permeability
and indicates how much greater than or less than µ0 the permeability of a material is.
4.1.3
Inductance L
A magnetic ﬁeld, and thus a magnetic ﬂux , will be generated around a conductor of any shape.
This will be particularly intense if the conductor is in the form of a loop (coil). Normally, there is

(4.11)
Inductance is one of the characteristic variables of conductor loops (coils). The inductance of a
conductor loop (coil) depends totally upon the material properties (permeability) of the space that
the ﬂux ﬂows through and the geometry of the layout.
4.1.3.1
Inductance of a Conductor Loop
If we assume that the diameter d of the wire used is very small compared with the diameter D of
the conductor coil (d/D < 0.0001) a very simple approximation can be used:
L = N2µ0R · ln
2R
d

(4.12)
where R is the radius of the conductor loop and d is the diameter of the wire used.
4.1.4
Mutual Inductance M
If a second conductor loop 2 (area A2) is located in the vicinity of conductor loop 1 (area A1),
through which a current is ﬂowing, then this will be subject to a proportion of the total magnetic
ﬂux  ﬂowing through A1. The two circuits are connected together by this partial ﬂux or coupling
ﬂux. The magnitude of the coupling ﬂux ψ21 depends upon the geometric dimensions of both
conductor loops, the position of the conductor loops in relation to one another, and the magnetic
properties of the medium (e.g. permeability) in the layout.
Similarly to the deﬁnition of the (self) inductance L of a conductor loop, the mutual inductance
M21 of conductor loop 2 in relation to conductor loop 1 is deﬁned as the ratio of the partial ﬂux
ψ21 enclosed by conductor loop 2, to the current I1 in conductor loop 1 (Paul, 1993):

Similarly, there is also a mutual inductance M12. Here, current I2 ﬂows through the conductor
loop 2, thereby determining the coupling ﬂux ψ12 in loop 1. The following relationship applies:
M = M12 = M21
(4.14)
Mutual inductance describes the coupling of two circuits via the medium of a magnetic ﬁeld.
Mutual inductance is always present between two electrical circuits. Its dimension and unit are the
same as for inductance.
The coupling of two electrical circuits via the magnetic ﬁeld is the physical principle upon
which inductively coupled RFID systems are based. Figure 4.9 shows a calculation of the mutual
inductance between a transponder antenna and three different reader antennas, which differ only in
diameter. The calculation is based upon the following values: M1 : R = 55 cm, M2 : R = 7.5 cm,
M3 : R = 1 cm, transponder: R = 3.5 cm. N = 1 for all reader antennas.
The graph of mutual inductance shows a strong similarity to the graph of magnetic ﬁeld strength
H along the x axis. Assuming a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, the mutual inductance M12 between
two coils can be calculated using Equation (4.13). It is found to be:
M12 = B2(I1) · N2 · A2
I1
= µ0 · H(I1) · N2 · A2

(4.15)
We ﬁrst replace H(I1) with the expression in equation (4.4), and substitute R2π for A, thus

In order to guarantee the homogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld in the area A2 the condition A2 ≤A1

coils lie on the same plane. Due to the relationship M = M12 = M21 the mutual inductance can be
calculated as follows for the case A2 ≥A1:

The coupling coefﬁcient always varies between the two extreme cases 0 ≤k ≤1.
• k = 0: Full decoupling due to great distance or magnetic shielding.
• k = 1: Total coupling. Both coils are subject to the same magnetic ﬂux . The transformer is
a technical application of total coupling, whereby two or more coils are wound onto a highly
permeable iron core.
An analytic calculation is only possible for very simple antenna conﬁgurations. For two parallel
conductor loops centred on a single x axis the coupling coefﬁcient according to Roz and Fuentes
(n.d.) can be approximated from the following equation. However, this only applies if the radii of
the conductor loops fulﬁl the condition rTransp ≤rReader. The distance between the conductor loops

Due to the ﬁxed link between the coupling coefﬁcient and mutual inductance M, and because
of the relationship M = M12 = M21, the formula is also applicable to transmitter antennas that are
smaller than the transponder antenna. Where rTransp ≥rReader, we write:

The coupling coefﬁcient k(x) = 1 (= 100%) is achieved where the distance between the conduc-
tor loops is zero (x = 0) and the antenna radii are identical (rTransp = rReader), because in this case
the conductor loops are in the same place and are exposed to exactly the same magnetic ﬂux ψ.
In practice, however, inductively coupled transponder systems operate with coupling coefﬁcients
that may be as low as 0.01 (<1%) (Figure 4.10).
4.1.6
Faraday’s Law
Any change to the magnetic ﬂux  generates an electric ﬁeld strength Ei. This characteristic of
the magnetic ﬁeld is described by Faraday’s law.
The effect of the electric ﬁeld generated in this manner depends upon the material properties of
the surrounding area. Figure 4.11 shows some of the possible effects (Paul, 1993):
• Vacuum: in this case, the ﬁeld strength E gives rise to an electric rotational ﬁeld. Periodic
changes in magnetic ﬂux (high-frequency current in an antenna coil) generate an electromagnetic
ﬁeld that propagates itself into the distance.

Physical Principles of RFID Systems
71
• Open conductor loop: an open-circuit voltage builds up across the ends of an almost closed
conductor loop, which is normally called induced voltage. This voltage corresponds with the line
integral (path integral) of the ﬁeld strength E that is generated along the path of the conductor
loop in space.
• Metal surface: an electric ﬁeld strength E is also induced in the metal surface. This causes free
charge carriers to ﬂow in the direction of the electric ﬁeld strength. Currents ﬂowing in circles
are created, so-called eddy currents. This works against the exciting magnetic ﬂux (Lenz’s law),
which may signiﬁcantly damp the magnetic ﬂux in the vicinity of metal surfaces. However, this
effect is undesirable in inductively coupled RFID systems (installation of a transponder or reader
antenna on a metal surface) and must therefore be prevented by suitable countermeasures (see
Section 4.1.12.3).
In its general form Faraday’s law is written as follows:
ui =

Ei · ds = −d(t)
dt
(4.21)
For a conductor loop conﬁguration with N windings, we can also say that ui = N · d/dt. (The
value of the contour integral ∫Ei · ds can be increased N times if the closed integration path is
carried out N times; Paul, 1993).
To improve our understanding of inductively coupled RFID systems we will now consider the
effect of inductance on magnetically coupled conduction loops.
A time-variant current i1 (t) in conduction loop L1 generates a time-variant magnetic ﬂux
d(i1)/dt. In accordance with the inductance law, a voltage is induced in the conductor loops
L1 and L2 through which some degree of magnetic ﬂux is ﬂowing. We can differentiate between
two cases:
• Self-inductance:
the ﬂux change generated by the current change din/dt induces a voltage un
in the same conductor circuit.
• Mutual inductance:
the ﬂux change generated by the current change din/dt induces a voltage
in the adjacent conductor circuit Lm. Both circuits are coupled by mutual inductance.

Figure 4.12 shows the equivalent circuit diagram for coupled conductor loops. In an inductively
coupled RFID system L1 would be the transmitter antenna of the reader. L2 represents the antenna of
the transponder, where R2 is the coil resistance of the transponder antenna. The current consumption
of the data memory is symbolised by the load resistor RL.
A time varying ﬂux in the conductor loop L1 induces voltage u2i in the conductor loop L2 due
to mutual inductance M. The ﬂow of current creates an additional voltage drop across the coil
resistance R2, meaning that the voltage u2 can be measured at the terminals. The current through
the load resistor RL is calculated from the expression u2/RL. The current through L2 also generates
an additional magnetic ﬂux, which opposes the magnetic ﬂux 1(i1). The above is summed up in
the following equation:
u2 = +d2
dt

dt −L2

(4.22)
Because, in practice, i1 and i2 are sinusoidal (RF) alternating currents, we write Equation (4.22)
in the more appropriate complex notation (where ω = 2πf):
u2 = jωM · i1 −jωL2 · i2 −i2R2
(4.23)
If i2 is replaced by u2/RL in equation (4.23), then we can solve the equation for u2:

(4.24)
4.1.7
Resonance
The voltage u2 induced in the transponder coil is used to provide the power supply to the data
memory (microchip) of a passive transponder (see Section 4.1.8.1). In order to signiﬁcantly improve
the efﬁciency of the equivalent circuit illustrated in Figure 4.12, an additional capacitor C2 is
connected in parallel with the transponder coil L2 to form a parallel resonant circuit with a resonant
frequency that corresponds with the operating frequency of the RFID system in question.1 The
resonant frequency of the parallel resonant circuit can be calculated using the Thomson equation:
1 However, in 13.56 MHz systems with anticollision procedures, the resonant frequency selected for the transponder
is often 1–5 MHz higher to minimise the effect of the interaction between transponders on overall performance.

Figure 4.13 shows the equivalent circuit diagram of a real transponder. R2 is the natural resistance
of the transponder coil L2 and the current consumption of the data carrier (chip) is represented by
the load resistor RL.
If a voltage uQ2 = ui is induced in the coil L2, the following voltage u2 can be measured at the
data carrier load resistor RL in the equivalent circuit diagram shown in Figure 4.13:

Figure 4.14 shows the simulated graph of u2 with and without resonance over a large frequency
range for a possible transponder system. The current i1 in the transmitter antenna (and thus also
(i1)), inductance L2, mutual inductance M, R2 and RL are held constant over the entire frequency
range.
We see that the graph of voltage u2 for the circuit with the coil alone (circuit from Figure 4.12) is
almost identical to that of the parallel resonant circuit (circuit from Figure 4.13) at frequencies well
below the resonant frequencies of both circuits, but that when the resonant frequency is reached,
voltage u2 increases by more than a power of ten in the parallel resonant circuit compared with
the voltage u2 for the coil alone. Above the resonant frequency, however, voltage u2 falls rapidly
in the parallel resonant circuit, even falling below the value for the coil alone.
For transponders in the frequency range below 135 kHz, the transponder coil L2 is generally
connected in parallel with a chip capacitor (C′
2 = 20–220 pF) to achieve the desired resonant
frequency. At the higher frequencies of 13.56 and 27.125 MHz, the required capacitance C2 is
usually so low that it is provided by the input capacitance of the data carrier together with the
parasitic capacitance of the transponder coil.
Let us now investigate the inﬂuence of the circuit elements R2, RL and L2 on voltage u2. To gain
a better understanding of the interactions between the individual parameters we will now introduce
the Q factor (the Q factor crops up again when we investigate the connection of transmitter antennas
in Section 11.4.1.3). We will refrain from deriving formulas because the electric resonant circuit is
dealt with in detail in the background reading.

The Q factor is a measure of the voltage and current step-up in the resonant circuit at its resonant
frequency. Its reciprocal 1/Q denotes the expressively named circuit damping d. The Q factor is
very simple to calculate for the equivalent circuit in Figure 4.13. In this case ω is the angular
frequency (ω = 2πf ) of the transponder resonant circuit:

(4.31)
A glance at Equation (4.31) shows that when R2 →∞and RL →0, the Q factor also tends
towards zero. On the other hand, when the transponder coil has a very low coil resistance R2 →0
and there is a high load resistor RL ≫0 (corresponding with very low transponder chip power
consumption), very high Q factors can be achieved. The voltage u2 is now proportional to the
quality of the resonant circuit, which means that the dependency of voltage u2 upon R2 and RL is
clearly deﬁned.
Voltage u2 thus tends towards zero where R2 →∞and RL →0. At a very low transponder coil
resistance R2 →0 and a high value load resistor RL ≫0, on the other hand, a very high voltage
u2 can be achieved (compare Equation 4.30).
It is interesting to note the path taken by the graph of voltage u2 when the inductance of the
transponder coil L2 is changed, thus maintaining the resonance condition (i.e. C2 = 1/ω2L2 for all
values of L2). We see that for certain values of L2, voltage u2 reaches a clear peak (Figure 4.15).
If we now consider the graph of the Q factor as a function of L2 (Figure 4.16), then we observe
a maximum at the same value of transponder inductance L2. The maximum voltage u2 = f (L2) is
therefore derived from the maximum Q factor, Q = f (L2), at this point.

This indicates that for every pair of parameters (R2, RL), there is an inductance value L2 at
which the Q factor, and thus also the supply voltage u2 to the data carrier, is at a maximum. This
should always be taken into consideration when designing a transponder, because this effect can be
exploited to optimise the energy range of an inductively coupled RFID system. However, we must
also bear in mind that the inﬂuence of component tolerances in the system also reaches a maximum
in the Qmax range. This is particularly important in systems designed for mass production. Such
systems should be designed so that reliable operation is still possible in the range Q ≪Qmax at
the maximum distance between transponder and reader.
RL should be set at the same value as the input resistance of the data carrier after setting the
‘power on’ reset, i.e. before the activation of the voltage regulator, as is the case for the maximum
energy range of the system.
4.1.8
Practical Operation of the Transponder
4.1.8.1
Power Supply to the Transponder
Transponders are classiﬁed as active or passive depending upon the type of power supply they use.
Active transponders incorporate their own battery to provide the power supply to the data carrier.
In these transponders, the voltage u2 is generally only required to generate a ‘wake up’ signal. As
soon as the voltage u2 exceeds a certain limit this signal is activated and puts the data carrier into
operating mode. The transponder returns to the power saving ‘sleep’ or ‘standby mode’ after the
completion of a transaction with the reader, or when the voltage u2 falls below a minimum value.
In passive transponders the data carrier has to obtain its power supply from the voltage u2. To
achieve this, the voltage u2 is converted into direct current using a low loss bridge rectiﬁer and
then smoothed. A simple basic circuit for this application is shown in Figure 3.18.

Physical Principles of RFID Systems

4.1.8.2
Voltage Regulation
The induced voltage u2 in the transponder coil very rapidly reaches high values due to resonance
step-up in the resonant circuit. Considering the example in Figure 4.14, if we increase the coupling
coefﬁcient k
– possibly by reducing the gap between reader and transponder – or the value of
the load resistor RL, then voltage u2 will reach a level much greater than 100 V. However, the
operation of a data carrier requires a constant operating voltage of 3–5 V (after rectiﬁcation).
In order to regulate voltage u2 independently of the coupling coefﬁcient k or other parameters,
and to hold it constant in practice, a voltage-dependent shunt resistor RS is connected in parallel
with the load resistor RL. The equivalent circuit diagram for this is shown in Figure 4.17.
As induced voltage uQ2 = ui increases, the value of the shunt resistor RS falls, thus reducing the
quality of the transponder resonant circuit to such a degree that the voltage u2 remains constant. To
calculate the value of the shunt resistor for different variables, we refer back to Equation (4.29) and
introduce the parallel connection of RL and RS in place of the constant load resistor RL. The equation
can now be solved with respect to RS. The variable voltage u2 is replaced by the constant voltage
uTransp – the desired input voltage of the data carrier – giving the following equation for RS:
RS =

Figure 4.18 shows the graph of voltage u2 when such an ‘ideal’ shunt regulator is used. Voltage
u2 initially increases in proportion with the coupling coefﬁcient k. When u2 reaches its desired
value, the value of the shunt resistor begins to fall in inverse proportion to k, thus maintaining an
almost constant value for voltage u2.
Figure 4.19 shows the variable value of the shunt resistor RS as a function of the coupling
coefﬁcient. In this example the value range for the shunt resistor covers several powers of ten. This
can only be achieved using a semiconductor circuit, therefore so-called shunt or parallel regulators
are used in inductively coupled transponders. These terms describe an electronic regulator circuit, the
internal resistance of which falls disproportionately sharply when a threshold voltage is exceeded.
A simple shunt regulator based upon a zener diode (N¨uhrmann, 1994) is shown in Figure 4.20.

However, u2 is not the internal operating voltage of the data carrier (3 or 5 V) here; it is
the RF input voltage at the terminal of the transponder coil L2 on the data carrier, i.e. prior to
rectiﬁcation. The voltage regulator (shunt regulator) should not yet be active at this supply voltage.
RL corresponds with the input resistance of the data carrier after the ‘power on reset’, C2 is made up
of the input capacitance Cp of the data carrier (chip) and the parasitic capacitance of the transponder
layout C′
2 : C2 = (C′
2 + Cp).
The inductive voltage (source voltage uQ2 = ui) of a transponder coil can be calculated using
Equation (4.21) for the general case. If we assume a homogeneous, sinusoidal magnetic ﬁeld in air
(permeability constant = µ0) we can derive the following, more appropriate, formula:
ui = µ0 · A · N · ω · Heff
(4.33)
where Heff is the effective ﬁeld strength of a sinusoidal magnetic ﬁeld, ω is the angular frequency
of the magnetic ﬁeld, N is the number of windings of the transponder coil L2, and A is the
cross-sectional area of the transponder coil.
We now replace uQ2 = ui = jωM · i1 from Equation (4.29) with Equation (4.33) and thus obtain
the following equation for the circuit in Figure 4.13:
u2 =
jω · µ0 · Heff · A · N

A more detailed analysis of Equation (4.36) shows that the interrogation ﬁeld strength is depen-
dent upon the frequency ω = 2πf in addition to the antenna area A, the number of windings N (of
the transponder coil), the minimum voltage u2 and the input resistance R2. This is not surprising,
because we have determined a resonance step-up of u2 at the resonant frequency of the transpon-
der resonant circuit. Therefore, when the transmission frequency of the reader corresponds to the
resonant frequency of the transponder, the interrogation ﬁeld strength Hmin is at its minimum value.
To optimise the interrogation sensitivity of an inductively coupled RFID system, the resonant
frequency of the transponder should be matched precisely to the transmission frequency of the
reader. Unfortunately, this is not always possible in practice. First, tolerances occur during the
manufacture of a transponder, which lead to a deviation in the transponder resonant frequency.
Second, there are also technical reasons for setting the resonant frequency of the transponder a few
percentage points higher than the transmission frequency of the reader (for example in systems
using anticollision procedures to keep the interaction of nearby transponders low).
Some semiconductor manufacturers incorporate additional smoothing capacitors into the
transponder chip to smooth out frequency deviations in the transponder caused by manufacturing
tolerances (see Figure 3.28 ‘tuning C’). During manufacture the transponder is adjusted to the
desired frequency by switching individual smoothing capacitors on and off (Sch¨urmann, 1993).
In Equation (4.36) the resonant frequency of the transponder is expressed as the product L2C2.
This is not recognisable at ﬁrst glance. In order to make a direct prediction regarding the frequency
dependency of interrogation sensitivity, we rearrange Equation (4.25) to obtain:
L2C2 =
1
(2πf0)2 = 1
ω2
0
(4.37)
By substituting this expression into the right-hand term under the root of Equation (4.36) we
obtain a function in which the dependence of the interrogation ﬁeld strength Hmin on the relationship
between the transmission frequency of the reader ω and the resonant frequency of the transponder ω0
is clearly expressed. This is based upon the assumption that the change in the resonant frequency of
the transponder is caused by a change in the capacitance of C2 (e.g. due to temperature dependence
or manufacturing tolerances of this capacitance), whereas the inductance L2 of the coil remains
constant. To express this, the capacitor C2 in the left-hand term under the root of Equation (4.36)
is replaced by C2 = (ω2

Therefore a deviation of the transponder resonant frequency from the transmission frequency

read range.
4.1.9.1
Energy Range of Transponder Systems
If the interrogation ﬁeld strength of a transponder is known, then we can also assess the energy
range associated with a certain reader. The energy range of a transponder is the distance from the
reader antenna at which there is just enough energy to operate the transponder (deﬁned by u2 min
and RL). However, the question of whether the energy range obtained corresponds to the maximum
functional range of the system also depends upon whether the data transmitted from the transponder
can be detected by the reader at the distance in question.

1.5 k). If the transponder resonant frequency deviates from the transmission frequency (13.56 MHz) of the
reader an increasingly high ﬁeld strength is required to address the transponder. In practical operation this
results in a reduction of the read range
Given a known antenna current2 I, radius R, and number of windings of the transmitter antenna
N1, the path of the ﬁeld strength in the x direction can be calculated using Equation (4.3) (see
Section 4.1.1.1). If we solve the equation with respect to x we obtain the following relationship
between the energy range and interrogation ﬁeld Hmin of a transponder for a given reader:

As an example (see Figure 4.22), let us now consider the energy range of a transponder as a
function of the power consumption of the data carrier (RL = u2/i2). The reader in this example gen-
erates a ﬁeld strength of 0.115 A/m at a distance of 80 cm from the transmitter antenna (radius R of
transmitter antenna: 40 cm). This is a typical value for RFID systems in accordance with ISO 15693.
As the current consumption of the transponder (lower RL) increases, the interrogation sensitivity
of the transponder also increases and the energy range falls.
The maximum energy range of the transponder is determined by the distance between transponder
and reader antenna at which the minimum power supply u2 min required for the operation of the data
carrier exists, even with an unloaded transponder resonant circuit (i.e. i2 →0, RL →∞). Where
distance x = 0 the maximum current i2 represents a limit, above which the supply voltage for the
data carrier falls below u2 min, which means that reliable operation of the data carrier can no longer
be guaranteed in this operating state.
2 If the antenna current of the transmitter antenna is not known it can be calculated from the measured ﬁeld strength
H(x) at a distance x, where the antenna radius R and the number of windings N1 are known (see Section 4.1.1.1).

4.1.9.2
Interrogation Zone of Readers
In the calculations above the implicit assumption was made of a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H
parallel to the coil axis x. A glance at Figure 4.23 shows that this only applies for an arrangement of
reader coil and transponder coil with a common central axis x. If the transponder is tilted away from
this central axis or displaced in the direction of the y or z axis this condition is no longer fulﬁlled.
If a coil is magnetised by a magnetic ﬁeld H, which is tilted by the angle ϑ in relation to the
central axis of the coil, then, in very general terms, the following applies:
u0ϑ = u0 · cos(ϑ)
(4.40)
where u0 is the voltage that is induced when the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. At an
angle ϑ = 90◦, in which case the ﬁeld lines run in the plane of the coil radius R, no voltage is
induced in the coil.
As a result of the bending of the magnetic ﬁeld lines in the entire area around the reader coil,
here too there are different angles ϑ of the magnetic ﬁeld H in relation to the transponder coil.
This leads to a characteristic interrogation zone (Figure 4.24, grey area) around the reader antenna.
Areas with an angle ϑ = 0◦in relation to the transponder antenna – for example along the coil
axis x, but also to the side of the antenna windings (returning ﬁeld lines) – give rise to an optimal
read range. Areas in which the magnetic ﬁeld lines run parallel to the plane of the transponder
coil radius R – for example, exactly above and below the coil windings – exhibit a signiﬁcantly
reduced read range. If the transponder itself is tilted through 90◦a completely different picture of
the interrogation zone emerges (Figure 4.24, dotted line). Field lines that run parallel to the R-plane
of the reader coil now penetrate the transponder coil at an angle ϑ = 0◦and thus lead to an optimal
range in this area.

Total Transponder–Reader System
Up to this point we have considered the characteristics of inductively coupled systems primarily
from the point of view of the transponder. In order to analyse in more detail the interaction between
transponder and reader in the system, we need to take a slightly different view and ﬁrst examine
the electrical properties of the reader so that we can then go on to study the system as a whole.
Figure 4.25 shows the equivalent circuit diagram for a reader (the practical realisation of this
circuit conﬁguration can be found in Section 11.4). The conductor loop necessary to generate the
magnetic alternating ﬁeld is represented by the coil L1. The series resistor R1 corresponds with the
ohmic losses of the wire resistance in the conductor loop L1. In order to obtain maximum current
in the conductor coil L1 at the reader operating frequency fTX, a series resonant circuit with the
resonant frequency fRES = fTX is created by the serial connection of the capacitor C1. The resonant
frequency of the series resonant circuit can be calculated very easily using the Thomson equation
(4.25). The operating state of the reader can be described by:
fTX = fRES =
1
2π√L1 · C1
(4.41)
Because of the series conﬁguration, the total impedance Z1 of the series resonant circuit is the
sum of individual impedances, i.e.:
Z1 = R1 + jωL1 +
1
jωC1
(4.42)
At the resonant frequency fRES, however, the impedances of L1 and C1 cancel each other out.
In this case the total impedance Z1 is determined by R1 only and thus reaches a minimum.

transmission frequency of the reader, components should be sufﬁciently voltage resistant

The two voltages, u1 at the conductor loop L1, and uC1 at the capacitor C1, are in antiphase
and cancel each other out at the resonant frequency because current i1 is the same. However, the
individual values may be very high. Despite the low source voltage u0, which is usually just a few
volts, ﬁgures of a few hundred volts can easily be reached at L1 and C1. Designs for conductor
loop antennas for high currents must therefore incorporate sufﬁcient voltage resistance in the
components used, in particular the capacitors, because otherwise these would easily be destroyed
by arcing. Figure 4.26 shows an example of voltage step-up at resonance.
Despite the fact that the voltage may reach very high levels, it is completely safe to touch the
voltage-carrying components of the reader antenna. Because of the additional capacitance of the
hand, the series resonant circuit is rapidly detuned, thus reducing the resonance step-up of voltage.
4.1.10.1
Transformed Transponder Impedance Z ′
T
If a transponder enters the magnetic alternating ﬁeld of the conductor coil L1 a change can be
detected in the current i1. The current i2 induced in the transponder coil thus acts upon current i1
responsible for its generation via the magnetic mutual inductance M.3
In order to simplify the mathematical description of the mutual inductance on the current i1, let
us now introduce an imaginary impedance, the complex transformed transponder impedance Z′
T.
3 This is in accordance with Lenz’s law, which states that ‘the induced voltage always attempts to set up a current
in the conductor circuit, the direction of which opposes that of the voltage that induced it’ (Paul, 1993).

RFID Handbook
The electrical behaviour of the reader’s series resonant circuit in the presence of mutual inductance
is as if the imaginary impedance Z′
T were actually present as a discrete component: Z′
T takes on
a ﬁnite value |Z′
T| > 0. If the mutual inductance is removed, e.g. by withdrawing the transponder
from the ﬁeld of the conductor loop, then |Z′
T| = 0. We will now derive the calculation of this
transformed impedance step by step.
The source voltage u0 of the reader can be divided into the individual voltages uC1, uR1, uL1
and uZT in the series resonant circuit, as illustrated in Figure 4.27. Figure 4.28 shows the vector
diagram for the individual voltages in this circuit at resonance.
Due to the constant current i1 in the series circuit, the source voltage u0 can be represented as the
sum of the products of the individual impedances and the current i1. The transformed impedance
Z′
T is expressed by the product jωM ·i2:
u0 =
1
jωC1
· i1 + jωL1 · i1 + R1 · i1 −jωM · i2
(4.45)
Since the series resonant circuit is operated at its resonant frequency, the individual impedances
(jωC 1)−1 and jωL1 cancel each other out. The voltage u0 is therefore only divided between the
resistance R1 and the transformed transponder impedance Z′
T, as we can see from the vector diagram
(Figure 4.28). Equation 4.45 can therefore be further simpliﬁed to:
u0 = R1 · i1 −jωM · i2
(4.46)
We now require an expression for the current i2 in the coil of the transponder, so that we can
calculate the value of the transformed transponder impedance. Figure 4.29 gives an overview of
the currents and voltages in the transponder in the form of an equivalent circuit diagram:

Simple equivalent circuit diagram of a transponder in the vicinity of a reader. The impedance
Z2 of the transponder is made up of the load resistor RL (data carrier) and the capacitor C2
The source voltage uQ2 is induced in the transponder coil L2 by mutual inductance M. The
current i2 in the transponder is calculated from the quotient of the voltage u2 divided by the sum
of the individual impedances jωL2, R2 and Z2 (here Z2 represents the total input impedance of
the data carrier and the parallel capacitor C2). In the next step, we replace the voltage uQ2 by the
voltage responsible for its generation uQ2 = jωM · i1, yielding the following expression for u0:
u0 = R1 · i1 −jωM ·
uQ2
R2 + jωL2 + Z2
= R1 · i1 −jωM ·
jωM · i1
R2 + jωL2 + Z2
(4.47)
As it is generally impractical to work with the mutual inductance M, in a ﬁnal step we replace
M with M = k√L1 · L2 because the values k, L1 and L2 of a transponder are generally known.

88
RFID Handbook
We write:
u0 = R1 · i1 +
ω2k2 · L1 · L2
R2 + jωL2 + Z2
· i1
(4.48)
Dividing both sides of Equation (4.48) by i1 yields the total impedance Z0 = u0/i1 of the series
resonant circuit in the reader as the sum of R1 and the transformed transponder impedance Z′
T.
Thus Z′
T is found to be:
Z′
T =
ω2k2 · L1 · L2
R2 + jωL2 + Z2
(4.49)
Impedance Z2 represents the parallel connection of C2 and RL in the transponder. We replace
Z2 with the full expression containing C2 and RL and thus ﬁnally obtain an expression for Z′
T that
incorporates all components of the transponder and is thus applicable in practice:

4.1.10.2
Inﬂuencing Variables of Z ′
T
Let us now investigate the inﬂuence of individual parameters on the transformed transponder
impedance Z′
T. In addition to line diagrams, locus curves are also suitable for this investigation:
there is precisely one vector in the complex Z plane for every parameter value x in the function
Z′
T = f (x) and thus exactly one point on the curve.
All line diagrams and locus curves in Section 4.1.10 are – unless stated otherwise – calculated
using the constant parameter values listed in Table 4.3.
4.1.10.2.1
Transmission Frequency fTX
Let us ﬁrst change the transmission frequency fTX of the reader, while the transponder resonant
frequency fRES is kept constant. Although this case does not occur in practice it is very useful as a
theoretical experiment to help us to understand the principles behind the transformed transponder
impedance Z′
T.
Figure 4.30 shows the locus curve Z′
T = f (fTX) for this case. The impedance vector Z′
T traces
a circle in the clockwise direction in the complex Z plane as transmission frequency fTX increases.
In the frequency range below the transponder resonant frequency (fTX < fRES) the impedance
vector Z′
T is initially found in quadrant I of the complex Z plane. The transformed transponder
impedance Z′
T is inductive in this frequency range.
If the transmission frequency precisely corresponds with the transponder resonant frequency
(fTX = fRES) then the reactive impedances for L2 and C2 in the transponder cancel each other out.

parallel resonant circuit
Z′
T acts as an ohmic (real) resistor – the locus curve thus intersects the real x axis of the complex
Z plane at this point.
In the frequency range above the transponder resonant frequency (fTX > fRES), the locus curve
ﬁnally passes through quadrant IV of the complex Z plane – Z′
T has a capacitive effect in this
range.
The impedance locus curve of the complex transformed transponder impedance Z′
T corresponds
with the impedance locus curve of a damped parallel resonant circuit with a parallel resonant
frequency equal to the resonant frequency of the transponder. Figure 4.31 shows an equivalent
circuit diagram for this. The complex current i2 in the coil L2 of the transponder resonant circuit
is transformed by the magnetic mutual inductance M in the antenna coil L1 of the reader and acts
there as a parallel resonant circuit with the (frequency-dependent) impedance Z′
T. The value of the
real resistor R′ in the equivalent circuit diagram corresponds to the point of intersection of the
locus curve Z′
T with the real axis in the Z plane.
4.1.10.2.2
Coupling Coefﬁcient k
Given constant geometry of the transponder and reader antenna, the coupling coefﬁcient k is deﬁned
by the distance and angle of the two coils in relation to each other (see Section 4.1.5). The inﬂuence
of metals in the vicinity of the transmitter or transponder coil on the coupling coefﬁcient should
not be disregarded (e.g. shielding effect caused by eddy current losses). In practice, therefore, the
coupling coefﬁcient is the parameter that varies the most. Figure 4.32 shows the locus curve of the
complex transformed transponder impedance for the range 0 ≤k ≤1.

We differentiate between three ranges:
• k = 0: If the transponder coil L2 is removed from the ﬁeld of the reader antenna L1 entirely,
then no mutual inductance occurs. For this limit case, the transformed transponder impedance is
no longer effective, that is Z′
T(k = 0) = 0.
• 0 < k < 1: If the transponder coil L2 is slowly moved towards the reader antenna L1, then the
coupling coefﬁcient, and thus also the mutual inductance M between the two coils, increases
continuously. The value of complex transformed transponder impedance increases proportion-
ately, whereby Z′
T ∼k2. When fTX exactly corresponds with fRES, Z′
T(k) remains real for all
values of k.4 Given a detuning of the transponder resonant frequency (fRES ̸= fTX), on the other
hand, Z′
T also has an inductive or capacitive component.
• k = 1: This case only occurs if both coils are identical in format, so that the windings of the two
coils L1 and L2 lie directly on top of each other at distance d = 0. Z′
T(k) reaches a maximum
in this case. In general the following applies: |Z′
T(k)max| = |Z′
T(Kmax)|.
4.1.10.2.3
Transponder Capacitance C2
We will now change the value of transponder capacitance C2, while keeping all other parameters
constant. This naturally detunes the resonant frequency fRES of the transponder in relation to the
transmission frequency fTX of the reader. In practice, different factors may be responsible for a
change in C2:
• manufacturing tolerances, leading to a static deviation from the target value;
• a dependence of the data carrier’s input capacitance on the input voltage u2 due to effects in the
semiconductor: C2 = f (u2);
• intentional variation of the capacitance of C2 for the purpose of data transmission (we will deal
with so-called ‘capacitive load modulation’ in more detail in Section 4.1.10.3);
• detuning due to environmental inﬂuences such as metal, temperature, moisture, and ‘hand capac-
itance’ when the smart card is touched.
Figure 4.33 shows the locus curve for Z′
T(C2) in the complex impedance plane. As expected,
the locus curve obtained is the circle in the complex Z plane that is typical of a parallel resonant
circuit. Let us now consider the extreme values for C2:
• C2 = 1/ω2
TXL2: The resonant frequency of the transponder in this case precisely corresponds with
the transmission frequency of the reader (see Equation 4.25). The current i2 in the transponder coil
reaches a maximum at this value due to resonance step-up and is real. Because Z′
T ∼jωM · i2
the value for impedance Z′
T also reaches a maximum – the locus curve intersects the real axis
in the complex Z plane. The following applies: |Z′
T(C2)|max = |Z′
T(C2 = 1/ωTX)2 · L2)|.
• C2 ̸= 1/ω2L2: If the capacitance C2 is less than or greater than C2 = 1/ω2
TXL2 then the resonant
frequency of the transponder will be detuned and will vary signiﬁcantly from the transmission fre-
quency of the reader. The polarity of the current i2 in the resonant circuit of the transponder varies
when the resonant frequency is exceeded, as we can see from Figure 4.34. Similarly, the locus
curve of Z′
T describes the familiar circular path in the complex Z plane. For both extreme values:
Z′
T(C2 →0) =
ω2k2 · L1 · L2
jωL2 + R2 + RL
(4.51)
4 The low angular deviation in the locus curve in Figure 4.32 where fRES = fTX is therefore due to the fact that
the resonant frequency calculated according to Equation (4.34) is only valid without limitations for the undamped
parallel resonant circuit. Given damping by RL and R2, on the other hand, there is a slight detuning of the resonant
frequency. However, this effect can be largely disregarded in practice and thus will not be considered further here.

4.1.10.2.4
Load Resistance RL
The load resistance RL is an expression for the power consumption of the data carrier (microchip)
in the transponder. Unfortunately, the load resistance is generally not constant, but falls as the
coupling coefﬁcient increases due to the inﬂuence of the shunt regulator (voltage regulator). The
power consumption of the data carrier also varies, for example during the read or write operation.
Furthermore, the value of the load resistance is often intentionally altered in order to transmit data
to the reader (see Section 4.1.10.3).
Figure 4.35 shows the corresponding locus curve for Z′
T = f (RL). This shows that the
transformed transponder impedance is proportional to RL. Increasing load resistance RL, which
corresponds with a lower(!) current in the data carrier, thus also leads to a greater value for
the transformed transponder impedance Z′
T. This can be explained by the inﬂuence of the load
resistance RL on the Q factor: a high-ohmic load resistance RL leads to a high Q factor in the
resonant circuit and thus to a greater current step-up in the transponder resonant circuit. Due to
the proportionality Z′
T ∼jωM · i2 – and not to iRL – we obtain a correspondingly high value for
the transformed transponder impedance.

If the transponder resonant frequency is detuned we obtain a curved locus curve for the trans-

because the phase angle of a detuned parallel resonant circuit also increases as the Q factor increases
(RL ↑), as we can see from a glance at Figure 4.34.

Transformed transponder impedance reaches a clear peak at a given inductance value, as a glance
at the line diagram shows (Figure 4.36).
This behaviour is reminiscent of the graph of voltage u2 = f (L2) (see also Figure 4.15). Here
too the peak transformed transponder impedance occurs where the Q factor, and thus the current
i2 in the transponder, is at a maximum (Z′
T ∼jωM · i2). Section 4.1.7, gives an explanation of the
mathematical relationship between load resistance and the Q factor.
4.1.10.3
Load Modulation
Apart from a few other methods (see Chapter 3), so-called load modulation is the most common
procedure for data transmission from transponder to reader by some margin. By varying the circuit
parameters of the transponder resonant circuit in time with the data stream, the magnitude and
phase of the transformed transponder impedance can be inﬂuenced (modulation) such that the data
from the transponder can be reconstructed by an appropriate evaluation procedure in the reader
(demodulation).
However, of all the circuit parameters in the transponder resonant circuit, only two can be altered
by the data carrier: the load resistance RL and the parallel capacitance C2. Therefore RFID literature
distinguishes between ohmic (or real) and capacitive load modulation.

4.1.10.3.1
Ohmic Load Modulation
In this type of load modulation a parallel resistor Rmod is switched on and off within the data carrier
of the transponder in time with the data stream (or in time with a modulated subcarrier) (Figure 4.37).
We already know from the previous section that the parallel connection of Rmod (→reduced total
resistance) will reduce the Q factor and thus also the transformed transponder impedance Z′
T. This
is also evident from the locus curve for the ohmic load modulator: Z′
T is switched between the
values Z′
T (RL) and Z′
T (RL||Rmod) by the load modulator in the transponder (Figure 4.38). The
phase of Z′
T remains almost constant during this process (assuming fTX = fRES).
In order to be able to reconstruct (i.e. demodulate) the transmitted data, the falling voltage uZT at
Z′
T must be sent to the receiver (RX) of the reader. Unfortunately, Z′
T is not accessible in the reader
as a discrete component because the voltage uZT is induced in the real antenna coil L1. However,

the modulation of the voltage component uZT by the load modulator in the transponder. Load mod-
ulation in the transponder thus brings about the amplitude modulation of the reader antenna voltage
uRX. The transmitted data is therefore not available in the baseband at L1; instead it is found in the
modulation products (= modulation sidebands) of the (load) modulated voltage u1 (see Chapter 6).
4.1.10.3.2
Capacitive Load Modulation
In capacitive load modulation it is an additional capacitor Cmod, rather than a modulation resistance,
that is switched on and off in time with the data stream (or in time with a modulated subcarrier)
(Figure 4.40). This causes the resonant frequency of the transponder to be switched between two
frequencies. We know from the previous section that the detuning of the transponder resonant
frequency markedly inﬂuences the magnitude and phase of the transformed transponder impedance
Z′
T. This is also clearly visible from the locus curve for the capacitive load modulator (Figure 4.41):
Z′
T is switched between the values Z′
T (ωRES1) and Z′
T (ωRES2) by the load modulator in the
transponder. The locus curve for Z′
T thereby passes through a segment of the circle in the complex
Z plane that is typical of the parallel resonant circuit.

Demodulation of the data signal is similar to the procedure used with ohmic load modulation.
Capacitive load modulation generates a combination of amplitude and phase modulation of the
reader antenna voltage uRX and should therefore be processed in an appropriate manner in the
receiver branch of the reader. The relevant vector diagram is shown in Figure 4.42.
4.1.10.3.3
Demodulation in the Reader
For transponders in the frequency range <135 kHz the load modulator is generally controlled
directly by a serial data stream encoded in the baseband, e.g. a Manchester encoded bit sequence.
The modulation signal from the transponder can be recreated by the rectiﬁcation of the amplitude-
modulated voltage at the antenna coil of the reader (see Section 11.3).
In higher-frequency systems operating at 6.78 or 13.56 MHz, on the other hand, the transponder’s
load modulator is controlled by a modulated subcarrier signal (see Section 6.2.4). The subcarrier
frequency fH is normally 847 kHz (ISO 14443-2), 423 kHz (ISO 15693) or 212 kHz.
Load modulation with a subcarrier generates two sidebands at a distance of ±fH to either side
of the transmission frequency (see Section 6.2.4). The information to be transmitted is held in the
two sidebands, with each sideband containing the same information. One of the two sidebands is
ﬁltered in the reader and ﬁnally demodulated to reclaim the baseband signal of the modulated data
stream.
4.1.10.3.4
The Inﬂuence of the Q Factor
As we know from the preceding section, we attempt to maximise the Q factor in order to maximise
the energy range and the retroactive transformed transponder impedance. From the point of view of
the energy range, a high Q factor in the transponder resonant circuit is deﬁnitely desirable. If we
want to transmit data from or to the transponder a certain minimum bandwidth of the transmission
path from the data carrier in the transponder to the receiver in the reader will be required. However,
the bandwidth B of the transponder resonant circuit is inversely proportional to the Q factor.
B = fRES
Q
(4.55)

Physical Principles of RFID Systems

Each load modulation operation in the transponder causes a corresponding amplitude modulation
of the current i2 in the transponder coil. The modulation sidebands of the current i2 that this
generates are damped to some degree by the bandwidth of the transponder resonant circuit, which
is limited in practice. The bandwidth B determines a frequency range around the resonant frequency
fRES, at the limits of which the modulation sidebands of the current i2 in the transponder reach a
damping of 3 dB relative to the resonant frequency (Figure 4.43). If the Q factor of the transponder
is too high, then the modulation sidebands of the current i2 are damped to such a degree due to
the low bandwidth that the range is reduced (transponder signal range).
Transponders used in 13.56 MHz systems that support an anticollision algorithm are adjusted
to a resonant frequency of 15–18 MHz to minimise the mutual inﬂuence of several transponders.
Due to the marked detuning of the transponder resonant frequency relative to the transmission
frequency of the reader the two modulation sidebands of a load modulation system with subcarrier
are transmitted at a different level (Figure 4.44).
The term bandwidth is problematic here (the frequencies of the reader and the modulation
sidebands may even lie outside the bandwidth of the transponder resonant circuit). However, the
selection of the correct Q factor for the transponder resonant circuit is still important, because the
Q factor can inﬂuence the transient effects during load modulation.
Ideally, the ‘mean Q factor’ of the transponder will be selected such that the energy range and
transponder signal range of the system are identical. However, the calculation of an ideal Q factor
is nontrivial and should not be underestimated because the Q factor is also strongly inﬂuenced by
the shunt regulator (in connection with the distance d between transponder and reader antenna) and
by the load modulator itself. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the bandwidth of the transmitter antenna
(series resonant circuit) on the level of the load modulation sidebands should not be underestimated.

If the transponder resonant frequency is markedly detuned compared with the transmission
frequency of the reader the two modulation sidebands will be transmitted at different levels. (Example based
upon subcarrier frequency fH = 847 kHz)
Therefore, the development of an inductively coupled RFID system is always a compromise
between the system’s range and its data transmission speed (baud rate/subcarrier frequency). Sys-
tems that require a short transaction time (that is, rapid data transmission and large bandwidth)
often only have a range of a few centimetres, whereas systems with relatively long transaction
times (that is, slow data transmission and low bandwidth) can be designed to achieve a greater
range. A good example of the former case is provided by contactless smart cards for local public
transport applications, which carry out authentication with the reader within a few 100 ms and
must also transmit booking data. Contactless smart cards for ‘hands free’ access systems that trans-
mit just a few bytes – usually the serial number of the data carrier – within 1–2 seconds are an
example of the latter case. A further consideration is that in systems with a ‘large’ transmission
antenna the data rate of the reader is restricted by the fact that only small sidebands may be gen-
erated because of the need to comply with the radio licensing regulations (ETS, FCC). Table 4.4
gives a brief overview of the relationship between range and bandwidth in inductively coupled
RFID systems.

Measuring the Coupling Coefﬁcient k
The coupling coefﬁcient k and the associated mutual inductance M are the most important param-
eters for the design of an inductively coupled RFID system. It is precisely these parameters that
are most difﬁcult to determine analytically as a result of the – often complicated – ﬁeld pattern.
Mathematics may be fun, but has its limits. Furthermore, the software necessary to calculate a
numeric simulation is often unavailable – or it may simply be that the time or patience is lacking.

However, the coupling coefﬁcient k for an existing system can be quickly determined by means
of a simple measurement. This requires a test transponder coil with electrical and mechanical
parameters that correspond with those of the ‘real’ transponder. The coupling coefﬁcient can be
simply calculated from the measured voltages UR at the reader coil and UT at the transponder coil

4.1.11.2
Measuring the Transponder Resonant Frequency and the Q Factor
The precise measurement of the transponder resonant frequency so that deviations from the desired
value can be detected is particularly important in the manufacture of inductively coupled transpon-
ders. However, since transponders are usually packed in a glass or plastic housing, which renders
them inaccessible, the measurement of the resonant frequency can only be realised by means of an
inductive coupling.
The measurement circuit for this is shown in Figure 4.47. A coupling coil (conductor loop with
several windings) is used to achieve the inductive coupling between transponder and measuring
device. The self-resonant frequency of this coupling coil should be signiﬁcantly higher (by a
factor of at least 2) than the self-resonant frequency of the transponder in order to minimise
measuring errors.
A phase and impedance analyser (or a network analyser) is now used to measure the impedance
Z1 of the coupling coil as a function of frequency. If Z1 is represented in the form of a line diagram
it has a curved path, as shown in Figure 4.48. As the measuring frequency rises the line diagram
passes through various local maxima and minima for the magnitude and phase of Z1. The sequence
of the individual maxima and minima is always the same.

Figure 4.48
The measurement of absolute value and phase at the measuring coil permits no conclusion to be
drawn regarding the resonance frequency of the transponder
In the event of mutual inductance with a transponder the impedance Z1 of the coupling coil L1
is made up of several individual impedances:
Z1 = R1 + jωL1 + Z′
T
(4.58)
Figure 4.49 shows the locus curve of impedance Z1 measured over a larger frequency range.
The locus curve starts with frequency 0 at origin Z1(f) = 0. With increasing measuring frequency,
the locus curve initially follows a line parallel to the y axis. For low measuring frequencies, the
effect of the transponder oscillating circuit can still be neglected, so Z1 = RL+ jωL1.
If the measuring frequency further increases the locus curve becomes a circle to be followed
clockwise, which is due to the effect of Z′
T in the range of the resonant frequency, i.e. |Z′
T| > 0.
There a several distinctive points on the circle. These points can also be recognized easily on the
line diagram for |Z1| (see Figure 4.48).
At ﬁrst, there is a point with a maximum value Z1 which can be recognized as a local maximum
also in the line diagram. The next distinctive point on the locus curve is the minimum value of
phase angle ϕ, which can also be clearly recognized in the line diagram (minimum on the dotted
line). The phase minimum is followed by a local minimum of value Z1 after which the locus curve,
with increasing measuring frequency, ﬁnally ends in a vertical line again. The local minimum Z1
is also clearly visible in the line diagram of Z1.
The point we are interested in, i.e. the transponder’s resonant frequency, corresponds to the
maximum value of the real component of Z1. This point, however, is not visible in the line
diagram of |Z1|. In order to determine the resonant frequency of a transponder, we have to measure
real component R of |Z1| with the resonant frequency corresponding to the maximum of R. An
alternative approach would be to measure the value of the transformed transponder impedance by
eliminating the inﬂuence of the measuring coil (R1, L1) through compensation measurement (short
correction; the centre of the circle that the locus curve describes in Figure 4.49 is then situated
on the diagram’s re-axis). For this kind of measurement, the maximum value of the transponder
impedance corresponds to the resonant frequency.

Figure 4.50 shows a measurement set-up for measuring the resonant frequency of a contactless
smart card. Measuring coil L1 and the measuring object, i.e. the contactless smart card on a spacer,
are clearly visible on the right hand side of the ﬁgure. Figure 4.51 presents a screenshot of the
measurement. Correction measurement was used for prior compensation of the measuring coil’s
impedance (L1, R1). For the given impedance value, the transponder resonant frequency can be
read off as the measuring curve’s maximum at 14.9325 MHz (marker 1).
With this measuring method, it is – under speciﬁc circumstances – possible to measure the Q fac-
tor of the transponder oscillating circuit. The Q factor measures the voltage and current overshoot
in the oscillating circuit at resonant frequency. Bandwidth B of an oscillating circuit is inversely
proportional to the Q factor and states a frequency range around the transponder’s resonant fre-
quency. At the limits of this range, coupled-in voltage u2 has decreased by 3 dB (factor 0.707) in
comparison to resonant frequency. The same applies to current i2 in coil L2 of the transponder
oscillating circuit as it is proportional to voltage u2. As even the measured transponder impedance
Z′
T is proportional to voltage u2 or current i2, respectively, we can determine the 3 dB bandwidth
for Z′
T und use formula 4.55 to determine the Q factor of the transponder oscillating circuit. Band-
width B then is deﬁned as the frequency range around the transponder resonant frequency at the
limits of which the value of Z′
T has decreased by 3 dB (factor 0.707) in comparison to the value
measured at resonant frequency.
Figure 4.51 presents an example of a measurement of a transponder’s Q factor where the Q
factor is automatically calculated by the measuring device. The 3 dB bandwidth (BW) is deﬁned

by the distance of the two markers 2 and 3 and, in this example, it is about 482 kHz. Prior to this
measurement, we have to compensate for the impedance contributed by the measuring coil (R1, L1)
in order to eliminate it from the measurement as it would falsify the result (i.e. without measuring
object, the measured value of the impedance should be zero over the entire given frequency range).
Another possible source of error when measuring the Q factor is to set the ﬁeld strength at a too
high value (i.e. the measuring current in coil L1 is too high). This may trigger the shunt regulator
or activate the transponder chip which changes the Q factor during the ongoing measurement.
Usually this effect is clearly visible, though, through a distinctive asymmetry or an ‘unsteady’
measuring curve.
4.1.12
Magnetic Materials
Materials with a relative permeability > 1 are termed ferromagnetic materials. These materials are
iron, cobalt, nickel, various alloys and ferrite.
4.1.12.1
Properties of Magnetic Materials and Ferrite
One important characteristic of a magnetic material is the magnetisation characteristic or hysteresis
curve. This describes B = f (H), which displays a typical path for all ferromagnetic materials.
Starting from the unmagnetized state of the ferromagnetic material, the virgin curve A →B is
obtained as the magnetic ﬁeld strength H increases. During this process, the molecular magnets
in the material align themselves in the B direction. (Ferromagnetism is based upon the presence
of molecular magnetic dipoles. In these, the electron circling the atomic core represents a current
and generates a magnetic ﬁeld. In addition to the movement of the electron along its path, the
rotation of the electron around itself, the spin, also generates a magnetic moment, which is of even
greater importance for the material’s magnetic behaviour.) Because there is a ﬁnite number of these
molecular magnets, the number that remain to be aligned falls as the magnetic ﬁeld increases, thus
the gradient of the hysteresis curve falls. When all molecular magnets have been aligned, B rises
in proportion to H only to the same degree as in a vacuum.
When the ﬁeld strength H falls to H = 0, the ﬂux density B falls to the positive residual value
BR, the remanence. Only after the application of an opposing ﬁeld (−H) does the ﬂux density B
fall further and ﬁnally return to zero. The ﬁeld strength necessary for this is termed the coercive
ﬁeld strength HC.

Ferrite is the main material used in high-frequency technology. This is used in the form of soft
magnetic ceramic materials (low Br), composed mainly of mixed crystals or compounds of iron
oxide (Fe2O3) with one or more oxides of bivalent metals (NiO, ZnO, MnO etc.) (Vogt. Elektronik,
1990). The manufacturing process is similar to that for ceramic technologies (sintering).
The main characteristic of ferrite is its high speciﬁc electrical resistance, which varies between
1 and 106  m depending upon the material type, compared to the range for metals, which vary
between 10−5 and 10−4  m. Because of this, eddy current losses are low and can be disregarded
over a wide frequency range. The relative permeability of ferrites can reach the order of magnitude
of µr = 2000.
An important characteristic of ferrite materials is their material-dependent limit frequency, which
is listed in the datasheets provided by the ferrite manufacturer. Above the limit frequency increased
losses occur in the ferrite material, and therefore ferrite should not be used outside the speciﬁed
frequency range.
4.1.12.2
Ferrite Antennas in LFM Transponders
Some applications require extremely small transponder coils (Figure 4.53). In transponders for
animal identiﬁcation, typical dimensions for cylinder coils are d × l = 5 × 0.75 mm. The mutual
inductance that is decisive for the power supply of the transponder falls sharply due to its propor-
tionality with the cross-sectional area of the coil (M ∼A; Equation 4.13). By inserting a ferrite
material with a high permeability µ into the coil (M ∼ →M ∼µ · H · A; Equation 4.13), the
mutual inductance can be signiﬁcantly increased, thus compensating for the small cross-sectional
area of the coil.
The inductance of a ferrite antenna can be calculated according to the following equation (Philips
Components, 1994):
L = µ0µFerrite · n2 · A

4.1.12.3
Ferrite Shielding in a Metallic Environment
The use of (inductively coupled) RFID systems often requires that the reader or transponder antenna
be mounted directly upon a metallic surface. This might be the reader antenna of an automatic ticket
dispenser or a transponder for mounting on gas bottles).
However, it is not possible to ﬁt a magnetic antenna directly onto a metallic surface. The
magnetic ﬂux through the metal surface induces eddy currents within the metal, which oppose the
ﬁeld responsible for their creation, i.e. the reader’s ﬁeld (Lenz’s law), thus damping the magnetic
ﬁeld in the surface of the metal to such a degree that communication between reader and transponder
is no longer possible. It makes no difference here whether the magnetic ﬁeld is generated by the

Reader antenna (left) and gas bottle transponder in a U-shaped core with read head (right) can
be mounted directly upon or within metal surfaces using ferrite shielding
coil mounted upon the metal surface (reader antenna) or the ﬁeld approaches the metal surface
from ‘outside’ (transponder on metal surface).
By inserting highly permeable ferrite between the coil and metal surface it is possible to largely
prevent the occurrence of eddy currents. This makes it possible to mount the antenna on metal
surfaces.
When ﬁtting antennas onto ferrite surfaces it is necessary to take into account the fact that the
inductance of the conductor loop or coils may be signiﬁcantly increased by the permeability of
the ferrite material, and it may therefore be necessary to readjust the resonant frequency or even
redimension the matching network (in readers) altogether (see Section 11.4).
4.1.12.4
Fitting Transponders in Metal
Under certain circumstances it is possible to ﬁt transponders directly into a metallic environment
(Figure 4.55). Glass transponders are used for this because they contain a coil on a highly permeable
ferrite rod. If such a transponder is inserted horizontally into a long groove on the metal surface
somewhat larger than the transponder itself, then the transponder can be read without any problems.
When the transponder is ﬁtted horizontally the ﬁeld lines through the transponder’s ferrite rod run
in parallel to the metal surface and therefore the eddy current losses remain low. The insertion of
the transponder into a vertical bore would be unsuccessful in this situation, since the ﬁeld lines
through the transponder’s ferrite rod in this arrangement would end at the top of the bore at right
angles to the metal surface. The eddy current losses that occur in this case hinder the interrogation
of a transponder.
It is even possible to cover such an arrangement with a metal lid. However, a narrow gap of
dielectric material (e.g. paint, plastic, air) is required between the two metal surfaces in order to
interrogate the transponder. The ﬁeld lines running parallel to the metal surface enter the cavity
through the dielectric gap (Figure 4.56), so that the transponder can be read. Fitting transponders
in metal allows them to be used in particularly hostile environments. They can even be run over
by vehicles weighing several tonnes without suffering any damage.
Disk tags and contactless smart cards can also be embedded between metal plates. In order to
prevent the magnetic ﬁeld lines from penetrating into the metal cover, metal foils made of a highly

ﬂux is generated through the transponder coil, so that this can be read.

Electromagnetic Waves
4.2.1
The Generation of Electromagnetic Waves
Earlier in the book we described how a time varying magnetic ﬁeld in space induces an electric
ﬁeld with closed ﬁeld lines (rotational ﬁeld; see also Figure 4.11). The electric ﬁeld surrounds the
magnetic ﬁeld and itself varies over time. Due to the variation of the electric rotational ﬁeld over
time, a magnetic ﬁeld with closed ﬁeld lines occurs in space (rotational ﬁeld). It surrounds the
electric ﬁeld and itself varies over time, thus generating another electric ﬁeld. Due to the mutual
dependence of the time-varying ﬁelds there is a chain effect of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in space
(Fricke et al., 1979).
Radiation can only occur given a ﬁnite propagation speed (c ≈300 000 km/s; speed of light)
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which prevents a change in the voltage at the antenna from being
followed immediately by the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the change. Figure 4.58 shows the creation
of an electromagnetic wave at a dipole antenna. Even at the alternating voltage’s zero crossover
(Figure 4.58c), the ﬁeld lines remaining in space from the previous half-wave cannot end at the
antenna, but close into themselves, forming eddies. The eddies in the opposite direction that occur
in the next half-wave propel the existing eddies, and thus the energy stored in this ﬁeld, away from
the emitter at the speed of light c. The magnetic ﬁeld is interlinked with the varying electrical ﬁeld
that propagates at the same time. When a certain distance is reached, the ﬁelds are released from the
emitter, and this point represents the beginning of electromagnetic radiation (→far ﬁeld). At high
frequencies, that is small wavelengths, the radiation generated is particularly effective, because in
this case the separation takes place in the direct vicinity of the emitter, where high ﬁeld strengths
still exist (Fricke et al., 1979).

4.2.1.1
Transition from Near-Field to Far-Field in Conductor Loops
The primary magnetic ﬁeld generated by a conductor loop begins at the antenna (see also
Section 4.1.1.1). As the magnetic ﬁeld propagates an electric ﬁeld increasingly also develops
by induction (compare Figure 4.11). The ﬁeld, which was originally purely magnetic, is thus
continuously transformed into an electromagnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, at a distance of λ/2π the
electromagnetic ﬁeld begins to separate from the antenna and wanders into space in the form of
an electromagnetic wave. The area from the antenna to the point where the electromagnetic ﬁeld
forms is called the near-ﬁeld of the antenna. The area after the point at which the electromagnetic
wave has fully formed and separated from the antenna is called the far-ﬁeld.
A separated electromagnetic wave can no longer retroact upon the antenna that generated it by
inductive or capacitive coupling. For inductively coupled RFID systems this means that once the
far-ﬁeld has begun a transformer (inductive) coupling is no longer possible. The beginning of the
far-ﬁeld (the radius rF = λ/2π can be used as a rule of thumb) around the antenna thus represents
an insurmountable range limit for inductively coupled systems.
The ﬁeld strength path of a magnetic antenna along the coil x axis follows the relationship 1/d3
in the near-ﬁeld, as demonstrated above. This corresponds with a damping of 60 dB per decade
(of distance). Upon the transition to the far ﬁeld, on the other hand, the damping path ﬂattens out,
because after the separation of the ﬁeld from the antenna only the free space attenuation of the
electromagnetic waves is relevant to the ﬁeld strength path. The ﬁeld strength then decreases only
according to the relationship 1/d as distance increases (see Equation 4.65). This corresponds with
a damping of just 20 dB per decade (of distance).
4.2.2
Radiation Density S
An electromagnetic wave propagates into space spherically from the point of its creation. At the
same time, the electromagnetic wave transports energy in the surrounding space. As the distance
from the radiation source increases, this energy is divided over an increasing spherical surface area.
In this connection we talk of the radiation power per unit area, also called radiation density S.
In a spherical emitter, the so-called isotropic emitter, the energy is radiated uniformly in all direc-
tions. At distance r the radiation density S can be calculated very easily as the quotient of the energy
supplied by the emitter (thus the transmission power PEIRP) and the surface area of the sphere.
S = PEIRP

4.2.3
Characteristic Wave Impedance and Field Strength E
The energy transported by the electromagnetic wave is stored in the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
of the wave. There is therefore a ﬁxed relationship between the radiation density S and the ﬁeld
strengths E and H of the interconnected electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The electric ﬁeld with electric

ﬁeld strength E is at right angles to the magnetic ﬁeld H. The area between the vectors E and H
forms the wavefront and is at right angles to the direction of propagation. The radiation density S
is found from the Poynting radiation vector S as a vector product of E and H.
S = E × H
(4.62)
The relationship between the ﬁeld strengths E and H is deﬁned by the permittivity and the
dielectric constant of the propagation medium of the electromagnetic wave. In a vacuum and also
in air as an approximation:
E = H · √µ0ε0 = H · ZF
(4.63)
ZF is termed the characteristic wave impedance (ZF = 120π = 377 ). Furthermore, the follow-
ing relationship holds:
E =

S · ZF
(4.64)
Therefore, the ﬁeld strength E at a certain distance r from the radiation source can be calculated
using Equation (4.61). PEIRP is the transmission power emitted from the isotropic emitter:

Polarisation of Electromagnetic Waves
The polarisation of an electromagnetic wave is determined by the direction of the electric ﬁeld of the
wave. We differentiate between linear polarisation and circular polarisation. In linear polarisation
the direction of the ﬁeld lines of the electric ﬁeld E in relation to the surface of the Earth provide
the distinction between horizontal (the electric ﬁeld lines run parallel to the surface of the Earth)
and vertical (the electric ﬁeld lines run at right angles to the surface of the Earth) polarisation.
So, for example, the dipole antenna is a linear polarised antenna in which the electric ﬁeld lines
run parallel to the dipole axis. A dipole antenna mounted at right angles to the Earth’s surface thus
generates a vertically polarised electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The transmission of energy between two linear polarised antennas is optimal if the two antennas
have the same polarisation direction. Energy transmission is at its lowest point, on the other hand,
when the polarisation directions of transmission and receiving antennas are arranged at exactly
90◦or 270◦in relation to one another (e.g. a horizontal antenna and a vertical antenna). In this
situation an additional damping of 20 dB has to be taken into account in the power transmission
due to polarisation losses (Rothammel, 2001), i.e. the receiving antenna draws just 1/100 of the
maximum possible power from the emitted electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In RFID systems, there is generally no ﬁxed relationship between the position of the portable
transponder antenna and the reader antenna. This can lead to ﬂuctuations in the read range that are
both high and unpredictable. This problem is aided by the use of circular polarisation in the reader
antenna. The principle generation of circular polarisation is shown in Figure 4.61: two dipoles

Reﬂection off a distant object is also used in radar technology
are ﬁtted in the form of a cross. One of the two dipoles is fed via a 90◦(λ/4) delay line. The
polarisation direction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated in this manner rotates through 360◦
every time the wavefront moves forward by a wavelength. The rotation direction of the ﬁeld can
be determined by the arrangement of the delay line. We differentiate between left-handed and
right-handed circular polarisation.
A polarisation loss of 3 dB should be taken into account between a linear and a circular polarised
antenna; however, this is independent of the polarisation direction of the receiving antenna (e.g.
the transponder).
4.2.4.1
Reﬂection of Electromagnetic Waves
An electromagnetic wave emitted into the surrounding space by an antenna encounters various
objects. Part of the high-frequency energy that reaches the object is absorbed by the object and
converted into heat; the rest is scattered in many directions with varying intensity.
A small part of the reﬂected energy ﬁnds its way back to the transmitter antenna. Radar tech-
nology uses this reﬂection to measure the distance and position of distant objects.
In RFID systems the reﬂection of electromagnetic waves (backscatter system, modulated radar
cross-section) is used for the transmission of data from a transponder to a reader. Because the
reﬂective properties of objects generally increase with increasing frequency, these systems are used
mainly in the frequency ranges of 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (USA), 2.45 GHz and above.
Let us now consider the relationships in an RFID system. The antenna of a reader emits an
electromagnetic wave in all directions of space at the transmission power PEIRP. The radiation
density S that reaches the location of the transponder can easily be calculated using Equation
(4.61). The transponder’s antenna reﬂects a power PS that is proportional to the power density S
and the so-called radar cross-section σ is:
PS = σ · S
(4.66)
The reﬂected electromagnetic wave also propagates into space spherically from the point of
reﬂection. Thus the radiation power of the reﬂected wave also decreases in proportion to the square
of the distance (r2) from the radiation source (i.e. the reﬂection). The following power density
ﬁnally returns to the reader’s antenna:
SBack =
PS
4πr2 = S ·
σ
4πr2 = PEIRP
4πr2 ·
σ
4πr2 = PEIRP · σ
(4π)2 · r4
(4.67)
The radar cross-section σ (RCS, scatter aperture) is a measure of how well an object reﬂects
electromagnetic waves. The radar cross-section depends upon a range of parameters, such as object
size, shape, material, surface structure, but also wavelength and polarisation.
The radar cross-section can only be calculated precisely for simple surfaces such as spheres, ﬂat
surfaces and the like (for example see Baur, 1985). The material also has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence.

116
RFID Handbook
For example, metal surfaces reﬂect much better than plastic or composite materials. Because the
dependence of the radar cross-section σ on wavelength plays such an important role, objects are
divided into three categories:
• Rayleigh range: the wavelength is large compared with the object dimensions. For objects smaller
than around half the wavelength, σ exhibits a λ−4 dependency and so the reﬂective properties
of objects smaller than 0.1λ can be completely disregarded in practice.
• Resonance range: the wavelength is comparable with the object dimensions. Varying the wave-
length causes σ to ﬂuctuate by a few decibels around the geometric value. Objects with sharp
resonance, such as sharp edges, slits and points may, at certain wavelengths, exhibit resonance
step-up of σ. Under certain circumstances this is particularly true for antennas that are being
irradiated at their resonant wavelengths (resonant frequency).
• Optical range: the wavelength is small compared with the object dimensions. In this case, only the
geometry and position (angle of incidence of the electromagnetic wave) of the object inﬂuence
the radar cross-section.
Backscatter RFID systems employ antennas with different construction formats as reﬂection
areas. Reﬂections at transponders therefore occur exclusively in the resonance range. In order to
understand and make calculations about these systems we need to know the radar cross-section
σ of a resonant antenna. A detailed introduction to the calculation of the radar cross-section can
therefore be found in the following sections.
It also follows from Equation (4.67) that the power reﬂected back from the transponder is
proportional to the fourth root of the power transmitted by the reader (Figure 4.63). In other words:
if we wish to double the power density S of the reﬂected signal from the transponder that arrives at
the reader, then, all other things being equal, the transmission power must be multiplied by sixteen!
4.2.5
Antennas
The creation of electromagnetic waves has already been described in detail in the previous section
(see also Sections 4.1.6 and 4.2.1). The laws of physics tell us that the radiation of electromagnetic
waves can be observed in all conductors that carry voltage and/or current. In contrast to these
effects, which tend to be parasitic, an antenna is a component in which the radiation or reception
of electromagnetic waves has been to a large degree optimised for certain frequency ranges by the

ﬁne-tuning of design properties. In this connection, the behaviour of an antenna can be precisely
predicted and is exactly deﬁned mathematically.
4.2.5.1
Gain and Directional Effect
Section 4.2.2 demonstrated how the power PEIRP emitted from an isotropic emitter at a distance
r is distributed in a fully uniform manner over a spherical surface area. If we integrate the power
density S of the electromagnetic wave over the entire surface area of the sphere the result we obtain
is, once again, the power PEIRP emitted by the isotropic emitter.
PEIRP =

Asphere
S · dA
(4.68)
However, a real antenna, for example a dipole, does not radiate the supplied power uniformly
in all directions. For example, no power at all is radiated by a dipole antenna in the axial direction
in relation to the antenna.
Equation (4.68) applies for all types of antennas. If the antenna emits the supplied power with
varying intensity in different directions, then Equation (4.68) can only be fulﬁlled if the radiation
density S is greater in the preferred direction of the antenna than would be the case for an isotropic
emitter. Figure 4.64 shows the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna in comparison to that of an
isotropic emitter. The length of the vector G() indicates the relative radiation density in the
direction of the vector. In the main radiation direction (Gi) the radiation density can be calculated
as follows:
S = P1 · Gi
4π · r2
(4.69)
P1 is the power supplied to the antenna. Gi is termed the gain of the antenna and indicates
the factor by which the radiation density S is greater than that of an isotropic emitter at the same
transmission power.

An important radio technology term in this connection is the EIRP (effective isotropic radiated
power).
PEIRP = P1 · Gi
(4.70)
This ﬁgure can often be found in radio licensing regulations (e.g. Section 5.2.4) and indicates
the transmission power at which an isotropic emitter (i.e. Gi = 1) would have to be supplied in
order to generate a deﬁned radiation power at distance r. An antenna with a gain Gi may therefore
only be supplied with a transmission power P1 that is lower by this factor so that the speciﬁed
limit value is not exceeded:
P1 = PEIRP
Gi
(4.71)
4.2.5.2
EIRP and ERP
In addition to power ﬁgures in EIRP we frequently come across the power ﬁgure ERP (equivalent
radiated power) in radio regulations and technical literature. The ERP is also a reference power
ﬁgure. However, in contrast to the EIRP, ERP relates to a dipole antenna rather than a spherical
emitter. An ERP power ﬁgure thus expresses the transmission power at which a dipole antenna
must be supplied in order to generate a deﬁned emitted power at a distance of r. Since the gain
of the dipole antenna (Gi = 1.64) in relation to an isotropic emitter is known, it is easy to convert
between the two ﬁgures:
PEIRP = PERP · 1.64
(4.72)
4.2.5.3
Input Impedance
A particularly important property of the antenna is the complex input impedance ZA. This is made
up of a complex resistance XA, a loss resistance RV and the so-called radiation resistance Rr:
ZA = Rr + RV + jXA
(4.73)
The loss resistance RV is an effective resistance and describes all losses resulting from the ohmic
resistance of all current-carrying line sections of the antenna (Figure 4.65). The power converted
by this resistance is converted into heat.
The radiation resistance Rr also takes the units of an effective resistance, but the power con-
verted within it corresponds with the power emitted from the antenna into space in the form of
electromagnetic waves.
At the operating frequency (i.e. the resonant frequency of the antenna) the complex resistance
XA of the antenna tends towards zero. For a loss-free antenna (i.e. RV = 0):
ZA(fRES) = Rr
(4.74)

The input impedance of an ideal antenna in the resonant case is thus a real resistance with the
value of the radiation resistance Rr. For a λ/2 dipole the radiation resistance Rr = 73 .
4.2.5.4
Effective Aperture and Scatter Aperture
The maximum received power that can be drawn from an antenna, given optimal alignment and
correct polarisation, is proportional to the power density S of an incoming plane wave and a
proportionality factor. The proportionality factor has the dimension of an area and is thus called
the effective aperture Ae. The following applies:
Pe = Ae · S
(4.75)
We can envisage Ae as an area at right angles to the direction of propagation, through which,
at a given radiation density S, the power Pe passes (Meinke and Gundlach, 1992). The power
that passes through the effective aperture is absorbed and transferred to the connected terminating
impedance ZT (Figure 4.66).
In addition to the effective aperture Ae, an antenna also possesses a scatter aperture σ = As at
which the electromagnetic waves are reﬂected.

Relationship between the radiation density S and the received power P of an antenna

RFID Handbook
In order to improve our understanding of this, let us once again consider Figure 4.65. When an
electromagnetic ﬁeld with radiation density S is received a voltage U0 is induced in the antenna,
which represents the cause of a current I through the antenna impedance ZA and the terminating
impedance ZT. The current I is found from the quotient of the induced voltage U0 and the series
connection of the individual impedances (Kraus, 1988):
I =
U0
ZT + ZA
=
U0

(Rr + RV + RT)2 + (XA + XT)2
(4.76)
Furthermore for the received power Pe transferred to ZT:
Pe = I 2 · RT
(4.77)
Let us now substitute I 2 in Equation (4.77) for the expression in Equation (4.76), obtaining:
Pe =
U2
0 · RT
(Rr + RV + RT)2 + (XA + XT)2
(4.78)
According to Equation (4.75) the effective aperture Ae is the quotient of the received power Pe
and the radiation density S. This ﬁnally yields:
Ae = Pe
S =
U2
0 · RT
S · [(Rr + RV + RT)2 + (XA + XT)2]
(4.79)
If the antenna is operated using power matching, i.e. RT = RV and XT = −XA, then the following
simpliﬁcation can be used:
Ae = U02
4SRr
(4.80)
As can be seen from Figure 4.65 the current I also ﬂows through the radiation resistance Rr of the
antenna. The converted power PS is emitted from the antenna and it makes no difference whether
the current I was caused by an incoming electromagnetic ﬁeld or by supply from a transmitter.
The power PS emitted from the antenna, i.e. the reﬂected power in the received case, can be
calculated from:
PS = I 2 · Rr
(4.81)
Like the derivation for Equation (4.79), for the scatter aperture As we ﬁnd:
σ = AS = PS
S = I 2 · Rr
S
=
U02 · Rr
S · [(Rr + RV + RT)2 + (XA + XT)2]
(4.82)
If the antenna is again operated using power matching and is also loss-free, i.e. RV = 0, RT = Rr
and XT = −XA, then as a simpliﬁcation:
σ = AS =
U2
0
4SRr
(4.83)
Therefore, in the case of the power matched antenna σ = As = Ae. This means that only half
of the total power drawn from the electromagnetic ﬁeld is supplied to the terminating resistor RT;
the other half is reﬂected back into space by the antenna.

Physical Principles of RFID Systems
121
The behaviour of the scatter aperture As at different values of the terminating impedance ZT is
interesting. Of particular signiﬁcance for RFID technology is the limit case ZT = 0. This represents
a short-circuit at the terminals of the antennas. From Equation (4.82) this is found to be:
σmax = AS - max = U02
SRr
= 4Ae|ZT=0
(4.84)
The opposite limit case consists of the connection of an inﬁnitely high-ohmic terminating resistor
to the antenna, i.e. ZT →∞. From Equation (4.82) it is easy to see that the scatter aperture As,
just like the current I, tends towards zero.
σmin = AS - min = 0|ZT→∞
(4.85)
The scatter aperture can thus take on any desired value in the range 0–4 Ae at various values
of the terminating impedance ZT (Figure 4.67). This property of antennas is utilised for the data
transmission from transponder to reader in backscatter RFID systems (see Section 4.2.6.6).
Equation (4.82) shows only the relationship between the scatter aperture AS and the individual
resistors of the equivalent circuit from Figure 4.65. However, if we are to calculate the reﬂected
power PS of an antenna (see Section 4.2.4.1) we need the absolute value for AS. The effective
aperture Ae of an antenna is proportional to its gain G (Kraus, 1988; Meinke and Gundlach,
1992). Since the gain is known for most antenna designs, the effective aperture Ae, and thus also

From Equation (4.75) it thus follows that:

4.2.5.5
Effective Length
As we have seen, a voltage U0 is induced in the antenna by an electromagnetic ﬁeld. The voltage
U0 is proportional to the electric ﬁeld strength E of the incoming wave. The proportionality factor
has the dimension of a length and is therefore called the effective length l0 (also effective height
h) (Meinke and Gundlach, 1992). The following is true:
U0 = l0 · E = l0 ·

S · ZF
(4.88)
For the case of the matched antenna (i.e. Rr = RT) the effective length can be calculated from
the effective aperture Ae (Kraus, 1988):
l0 = 2

Ae · Rr

(4.89)
If we substitute the expression in Equation (4.86) for Ae, then the effective length of a matched
antenna can be calculated from the gain G, which is normally known (or easy to ﬁnd by measuring):
l0 = λ0

4.2.5.6
Dipole Antennas
In its simplest form the dipole antenna consists solely of a straight piece of line (e.g. a copper wire)
of a deﬁned length (Figure 4.68). By suitable shaping, the characteristic properties, in particular
the radiation resistance and bandwidth, can be inﬂuenced.
A simple, extended half-wave dipole (λ/2 dipole) consists of a piece of line of length l = λ/2,
which is interrupted halfway along. The dipole is supplied at this break-point (Figure 4.69).
The parallel connection of two λ/2 pieces of line a small distance apart (d < 0.05λ) creates the
2-wire folded dipole. This has around four times the radiation resistance of the single λ/2 dipole
(Rr = 240--280 ). According to Rothammel (2001) the following relationship applies:

Kraus (1988, Chapter 2–22) if required.

The bandwidth of a dipole can be inﬂuenced by the ratio of the diameter of the λ/2 line section

somewhat in order to allow it to resonate at the desired frequency. In practice, the shortening

4.2.5.7
Yagi–Uda Antenna
The Yagi–Uda antenna, named after its inventors, could well be the most important variant of a
directional antenna in radio technology.
The antenna is an alignment array, made up of a driven emitter and a series of parasitic elements.
A typical Yagi – Uda antenna is shown in Figure 4.70. Parasitic dipoles are arranged in front of
the driven emitter (usually a dipole or 2-wire folded dipole) in the desired direction of maximum
radiation. These parasitic dipoles function as directors, while a rod, usually a single rod, behind the
exciter acts as a reﬂector. To create the directional transmission, the rods acting as directors must
be shorter, and the rod acting as a reﬂector must be longer, than the exciter operating at resonance
(Meinke and Gundlach, 1992). Compared with an isotropic emitter, gains of 9 dBi (based upon
three elements) to 12 dB (based upon seven elements) can be achieved with a Yagi–Uda antenna.
So-called long Yagi antennas (10, 15 or more elements) can even achieve gains of up to 15 dBi in
the main radiation direction.
Due to their size, Yagi–Uda antennas are used exclusively as antennas for readers. Like a torch,
the Yagi–Uda antenna transmits in only one direction of maximum radiation, at a precisely known
apex angle. Interference from adjacent devices or readers to the side can thus be suppressed and
tuned out.
Due to the popularity of the Yagi–Uda antenna both as an antenna for radio and television
reception and also in commercial radio technology, there is a huge amount of literature on the
operation and construction of this antenna design. Therefore, we will not deal with this antenna in
more detail at this point.

4.2.5.8
Patch or Microstrip Antenna
Patch antennas (also known as microstrip or planar antennas) can be found in many modern
communication devices. For example, they are used in the latest generations of GPS receivers and
mobile telephones, which are becoming smaller all the time. Thanks to their special construction
format, patch antennas also offer some advantages for RFID systems.
In its simplest form, a patch antenna comprises a printed circuit board (e.g. Teﬂon or PTFE for
higher frequencies) coated (i.e. metallised) on both sides, the underside of which forms a continuous
ground (Kraus, 2000). On the top there is a small rectangle, which is supplied via a microstrip
feed on one side, feeders through the base plate or capacitive coupling via an intermediate layer
(aperture-coupled patch antenna; see Kossel and Benedicter, n.d., Fries and Kossel, n.d.). Planar
antennas can therefore be manufactured cheaply and with high levels of reproducibility using PCB
etching technology.
The length Lp of the patch determines the resonant frequency of the antenna. Under the condition
hD ⩽λ:
LP = λ
2 −hD
(4.93)
Normally the substrate thickness hD is 1–2% of the wavelength.
The width wp inﬂuences the resonant frequency of the antenna only slightly, but determines the
radiation resistance Rr of the antenna (Krug, 1985). Where wp < λ/2:

(reproduced by permission of Trolleyscan, South Africa)
If the patch antenna is operated at its resonant frequency the phase difference between the patch
edges a and b is precisely 180◦. Figure 4.71 shows the path of the electrical ﬁeld lines. At the
entry and exit edges of the patch the ﬁeld lines run in phase. The patch edges a and b thus behave
like two in-phase fed slot antennas. The polarisation of the antenna is linear and parallel to the
longitudinal edge Lp.
Due to the type of power supply, patch antennas can also be used with circular polarisation. To
generate circular polarisation, an emitter element must be supplied with signals with a phase angle
of 90◦at only two edges that are geometrically offset by 90◦.

The interconnection of patch elements to form a group increases the directional effect and gain

It is a relatively simple matter to amalgamate patch antennas to form group antennas
(Figure 4.74). As a result, the gain increases in relation to that of an individual element. The layout
shown in the ﬁgure comprises in-phase fed emitter elements. The approximately λ/2 long patch
elements are fed via almost nonradiative line sections of around λ/2 in length connected in series,
so that the transverse edges a–a or b–b of the patch element lie precisely wavelength λ apart.
Thus the in-phase feed to the individual elements is guaranteed. The arrangement is polarised in
the direction of the line sections.

Slot Antennas
If we cut a strip of length λ/2 out of the centre of a large metal surface the slot can be used as an
emitter (Rothammel, 2001). The width of the slot must be small in relation to its length. The base
point of the emitter is located at the mid-point of its longitudinal side.

Let us now turn our attention to practical operation when a transponder is located in the interrogation
zone of a reader. Figure 4.76 shows the simpliﬁed model of such a backscatter system. The reader
emits an electromagnetic wave with the effective radiated power P1 · G1 into the surrounding space.
Of this, a transponder receives power P2 = Pe, proportional to the ﬁeld strength E, at distance r.
Power PS is also reﬂected by the transponder’s antenna, of which power P3 is again received
by the reader at distance r.

Section 4.2.6.6).
It is relatively simple to make the conversion between the components of the two equivalent
circuits. For example, the transponder impedance ZT can be determined from the functional or the

Power Supply of Passive Transponders
A passive transponder does not have its own power supply from an internal voltage source, such
as a battery or solar cell. If the transponder is within range of the reader a voltage U0 is induced
in the transponder antenna by the ﬁeld strength E that occurs at distance r. Part of this voltage
is available at the terminals of the antenna as voltage UT. Only this voltage UT is rectiﬁed and is
available to the transponder as supply voltage (rectenna) (Jurianto and Chia, n.d. a, b).
In the case of power matching between the radiation resistor Rr and the input impedance ZT of
the transponder, power P2 = Pe can be derived from Equation (4.87). Figure 4.78 shows the power
available in RFID systems at different distances at the reader’s normal transmission power. In order

The maximum power Pe(0 dBm = 1 mW) available for the operation of the transponder, in the
case of power matching at the distance r, using a dipole antenna at the transponder
to use this low power as effectively as possible a Schottky detector with impedance matching is
typically used as a rectiﬁer.
A Schottky diode consists of a metal–semiconductor sequence of layers. At the boundary layer
there is, as in the p –n junction, a charge-free space-charge zone and a potential barrier that hinders
charge transport. The current–voltage characteristic of the metal–semiconductor transition has a
diode characteristic. Schottky diodes function as a rectiﬁer at wavelengths below the microwave
range since, unlike the pn diode, there are no inertia effects caused by minority carrier injection.
Further advantages in comparison with pn diodes are the low voltage drop in the direction of ﬂow
and the low noise. A possible layout of a Schottky diode is shown in Figure 4.79 (Hewlett Packard
988, n.d.).
A Schottky diode can be represented by a linear equivalent circuit (Figure 4.79b). Cj represents
the parasitic junction capacitance of the chip and Rs is the loss resistance in the terminals of
the diode. Rj is the junction resistor of the diode, which can be calculated as follows (Agilent
Technologies, n.d.):
Rj = 8.33 · 10−5 · n · T

A Schottky diode is created by a metal–semiconductor junction. In small signal operation a
Schottky diode can be represented by a linear equivalent circuit
where n is the ideality factor, T the temperature in Kelvin, Is the saturation current and Ib the bias
current through the Schottky diode.
By a suitable combination of the p- or n-doped semiconductor with the various metals the
properties of the Schottky diode can be varied across a wide range. In RFID transponders primarily
p-doped Schottky diodes are used, since these are particularly suitable for detectors with no zero
bias in small signal operation, i.e. for the conditions that occur in every transponder (Hewlett
Packard, 988).
The circuit of a Schottky detector for voltage rectiﬁcation is shown in Figure 4.80. Such a
Schottky detector has different operating ranges. If it is driven at power above −10 dBm (0.1 mW)
the Schottky detector lies in the range of linear detection (Hewlett Packard, 986). Here there is
peak value rectiﬁcation, as is familiar from the ﬁeld of power electronics. The following holds:

When operated at powers below −20 dBm (10 µW) the Schottky diode is in the square law range
Schottky detectors in RFID transponders operate in the range of square law detection at greater
distances from the reader, but also in the transition range to linear detection at smaller distances
(Figure 4.81).
The relationship between the input power and output voltage of a Schottky detector can be
expressed using a Bessel function of zeroth order (Hewlett Packard, 1088):

Where  = q/(k · T ), q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temper-
ature of the diode in Kelvin, Rg is the internal resistance of the voltage source (in transponders this
is the radiation resistance Rr of the antenna), Pin is the supplied power, RL is the connected load
resistor (transponder chip) and uchip is the output voltage (supply voltage of the transponder chip).
By numerical iteration using a program such as Mathcad (1994) this equation can easily be
solved, yielding a diagram uchip(Pin) (see Figure 4.83). The transition from square law detection to
linear law detection at around −20 (10 µW) to −10 dBM (0.1 mW) input power is clearly visible
in this ﬁgure.
Evaluating Equation (4.102), we see that a higher saturation current Is leads to good sensitivity
in the square law detection range. However, in the range that is of interest for RFID transponders,
with output voltages uchip of 0.8–3 V, this effect is unfortunately no longer marked.
In order to further increase the output voltage, voltage doublers (Hewlett Packard, 956-4) are
used. The circuit of a voltage doubler is shown in Figure 4.82. The output voltage uchip at constant
input power Pin is almost doubled in comparison to the single Schottky detector (Figure 4.83). The

−20 to −10 dBm the transition from square law to linear law detection can be clearly seen (RL = 500 k,
Is = 2 µA, n = 1.12)
Bessel function (Equation 4.102) can also be used for the calculation of the relationship of Pin to
uchip in voltage doublers. However, the value used for Rg should be doubled, the value RL should
be halved, and the calculated values for the output voltage uchip should also be doubled.
The inﬂuence of various operating frequencies on the output voltage is not taken into account in
Equation (4.102). In practice, however, a frequency-dependent current ﬂows through the parasitic
capacitor Cj, which has a detrimental effect upon the efﬁciency of the Schottky detector. The

134

inﬂuence of the junction capacitance on the output voltage can be expressed by a factor M (Hewlett
Packard, 1088). The following holds:
M =
1
1 + ω2C2
j RsRj
(4.103)
However, in the range that is of interest for RFID transponders at output voltages uchip 0.8–3 V
and the resulting junction resistances Rj in the range <250  (Hewlett Packard, 1088) the inﬂuence
of the junction capacitance can largely be disregarded (see also Figure 4.83).
In order to utilise the received power Pe as effectively as possible, the input impedance Zrect
of the Schottky detector would have to represent the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance
ZA (voltage source), i.e. Zrect = Z∗
A. If this condition is not fulﬁlled, then only part of the power
is available to the Schottky detector, as a glance at Figure 4.67 makes unmistakably clear.
The RF equivalent circuit of a Schottky detector is shown in Figure 4.80. It is the job of the
capacitor C2 to ﬁlter out all RF components of the generated direct voltage and it is therefore
dimensioned such that XC2 tends towards zero at the transmission frequency of the reader. In this
frequency range the diode (or the equivalent circuit of the diode) thus appears to lie directly parallel
to the input of the circuit. The load resistor RL is short-circuited by the capacitor C2 for the RF
voltages and is thus not present in the RF equivalent circuit. RL, however, determines the current
Ib through the Schottky detector and thus also the junction resistance Rj of the Schottky diode.

The RF equivalent circuit of a voltage doubler correspondingly consists of the parallel connection
of two Schottky diodes.
In order to now achieve the required power matching between the antenna and the Schottky
detector, the input impedance Zrect of the Schottky detector must be matched by means of a circuit
for the impedance matching at the antenna impedance ZA. In RF technology, discrete components,
i.e. L and C, but also line sections of differing impedances (line transformation), can be used for this.
At ideal matching, the voltage sensitivity γ 2xs (in mV/µW) of a Schottky detector can be simply
calculated (Figure 4.85; Hewlett Packard, 963, 1089):

(4.104)
The theoretical maximum of γ 2 lies at 200 mV/µW (868 MHz) for a Schottky diode of type
HSM 2801, and occurs at a total diode current IT = Is + Ib of 0.65 µA. The saturation current
Is of the selected Schottky diode is, however, as low as 2 µA, which means that in theory this
voltage sensitivity is completely out of reach, even at an operating current Ib = 0. Additionally,
the junction resistance Rj = 40 k that results at IT = 0.65 µA can hardly be approximately
transformed without loss using real components at the low-ohmic source impedance of the
antenna ZA = 73  + j0 . Finally, the inﬂuence of the parasitic junction capacitance Cj at such
high-ohmic junction resistances is clearly visible, and shows itself in a further reduction in the
voltage sensitivity, particularly at 2.45 GHz.

In practice, Schottky detectors are operated at currents of 2.5–25 µA, which leads to a signiﬁ-
cantly lower junction resistance. In practice, values around 50 mV/µW can be assumed for voltage
sensitivity (Hewlett Packard, 1089).
Due to the inﬂuencing parameters described above it is a great challenge for the designer design-
ing a Schottky detector for an RFID transponder to select a suitable Schottky diode for the operating
case in question and to set all operating parameters such that the voltage sensitivity of the Schottky
detector is as high as possible.
Let us ﬁnally consider another example of the matching of a Schottky voltage doubler to
a dipole antenna. Based upon two Schottky diodes connected in parallel in the RF equivalent
circuit (Lp = 2 nH, Cp = 0.08 pF, Rs = 20 , Cj = 0.16 pF, IT = 3 µA, Rj = 8.6 k) we obtain
an impedance Zrect = 37−j374 (|Zrect| = 375 ). The Smith diagram in Figure 4.86 shows a

possible transformation route, plus the values and sequence of the components used in this example
that would be necessary to perform a matching to 72  (dipole in resonance).
It is not always sensible or desirable to perform impedance matching between transponder chip
and antenna by means of discrete components. Particularly in the case of labels, in which the
transponder chip is mounted directly upon foil, additional components are avoided where possible.
If the elements of a dipole are shortened or lengthened (i.e. operated at above or below their
resonant frequency), then the impedance ZA of the antenna contains an inductive or capacitive
component XT ̸= 0. Furthermore, the radiation resistance Rs can be altered by the construction
format. By a suitable antenna design it is thus possible to set the input impedance of the antenna
to be the complex conjugate of the input impedance of the transponder, i.e. ZT = Z∗
A. The power
matching between transponder chip and antenna is thereby only realised by the antenna.
4.2.6.3
Power Supply of Active Transponders
In active transponders the power supply of the semiconductor chip is provided by a battery.
Regardless of the distance between transponder and reader the voltage is always high enough to
operate the circuit. The voltage supplied by the antenna is used to activate the transponder by
means of a detection circuit. In the absence of external activation the transponder is switched into
a power-saving mode in order to save the battery from unnecessary discharge.
Depending upon the type of evaluation circuit a much lower received power Pe is needed to
activate the transponder than is the case for a comparable passive transponder. Thus the read range
is greater compared with a passive transponder. In practice, ranges of over 10 m are normal.
4.2.6.4
Reﬂection and Cancellation
The electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted by the reader is not only reﬂected by a transponder, but also
by all objects in the vicinity, the spatial dimension of which is greater than the wavelength λo of

138
RFID Handbook
the ﬁeld (see also Section 4.2.4.1). The reﬂected ﬁelds are superimposed upon the primary ﬁeld
emitted by the reader. This leads alternately to a local damping or even so-called cancellation
(antiphase superposition) and an ampliﬁcation (in-phase superposition) of the ﬁeld at intervals of
λ0/2 between the individual minima. The simultaneous occurrence of many individual reﬂections of
varying intensity at different distances from the reader leads to a very erratic path of ﬁeld strength
E around the reader, with many local zones of cancellation of the ﬁeld. Such effects should
be expected, particularly in an environment containing large metal objects, e.g. in an industrial
operation (machines, metal pipes etc.).
We are all familiar with the effect of reﬂection and cancellation in our daily lives. In built-up
areas it is not unusual to ﬁnd that when you stop your car at trafﬁc lights you are in a ‘radio gap’
(i.e. a local cancellation) and instead of your favourite radio station all you can hear from the radio
is noise. Experience shows that it is generally sufﬁcient to roll the car forward just a short way,
thus leaving the area of local cancellation, in order to restore the reception.
In RFID systems these effects are much more disruptive, since a transponder at a local ﬁeld
strength minimum may not have enough power at its disposal for operation. Figure 4.88 shows
the results of the measurement of the reader’s ﬁeld strength E at an increasing distance from the
transmission antenna when reﬂections occur in close proximity to the reader.
4.2.6.5
Sensitivity of the Transponder

minimum ﬁeld strength is called the interrogation ﬁeld strength Emin and is simple to calculate.
Based upon the minimum required RF input power Pe−min of the Schottky detector and of the
transponder antenna gain G we ﬁnd:
Emin =

4π · ZF · Pe - min
λ2
0 · G
(4.105)
This is based upon the prerequisite that the polarisation directions of the reader and transponder
antennas precisely correspond. If the transponder is irradiated with a ﬁeld that has a different
polarisation direction, then Emin increases accordingly.
4.2.6.6
Modulated Backscatter
As we have already seen, the transponder antenna reﬂects part of the irradiated power at the scatter
aperture σ (As) of the transponder antenna. In this manner, a small part of the power P1 that was
originally emitted by the reader returns to the reader via the transponder as received power P3.
The dependence of the scatter aperture σ on the relationship between ZT and ZA established in
Section 4.2.5.4 is used in RFID transponders to send data from the transponder to the reader. To
achieve this, the input impedance ZT of the transponder is altered in time with the data stream to
be transmitted by the switching on and off of an additional impedance Zmod in time with the data
stream to be transmitted. As a result, the scatter aperture σ, and thus the power PS reﬂected by the
transponder, is changed in time with the data, i.e. it is modulated. This procedure is therefore also
known as modulated backscatter or σ-modulation.
In order to investigate the relationships in a RFID transponder more precisely, let us now refer
back to Equation (4.82), since this equation expresses the inﬂuence of the transponder impedance
ZT = RT + XT on the scatter aperture σ. In order to replace U 2
0 by the general properties of the
transponder antenna we ﬁrst substitute Equation (4.90) into Equation (4.88) and obtain:
U0 = λ0 ·

G · Rr
π · ZF
·

S · ZF = λ0 ·

G · Rr · S
π
(4.106)
We now replace U0 in Equation (4.82) by the right-hand expression in Equation (4.106) and
ﬁnally obtain (PALOMAR, 18 000):
σ =
λ02 · R2
r · G
π · [(Rr + RV + RT)2 + (XA + XT)2]
(4.107)
where G is the gain of the transponder antenna.
However, a drawback of this equation is that it only expresses the value of the scatter aperture
σ(PALOMAR, 18 000). If, for the clariﬁcation of the resulting problems, we imagine a transponder,
for which the imaginary component of the input impedance ZT in unmodulated state takes the
value XToff = −XA + Xmod, but in the modulated state (modulation impedance Zmod connected
in parallel) it is XTon = −XA –Xmod. We further assume that the real component RT of the input
impedance ZT is not inﬂuenced by the modulation. For this special case the imaginary part of
the impedance during modulation between the values (+Xmod)2 and (–Xmod)2 is switched. As
can be clearly seen, the value of the scatter aperture σ remains constant. Equation (4.81), on the
other hand, shows that the reﬂected power PS is proportional to the square of the current I in the
antenna. However, since by switching the imaginary part of the impedances between −Xmod and
+Xmod we also change the phase θ of the current I, we can conclude that the phase θ of the
reﬂected power PS also changes to the same degree.

To sum up, therefore, we can say that modulating the input impedance ZT of the transponder
results in the modulation of the value and/or phase of the reﬂected power PS and thus also of the
scatter aperture σ. PS and σ should thus not be considered as real quantities in RFID systems,
but as complex quantities. The relative change in value and phase of the scatter aperture σ can be
expressed using the following equation (PALOMAR, 18 000):
σ = λ2
0 · G · Zmod
4 · π · Rr
(4.108)
RFID transponders’ property of generating mixed phase and amplitude modulation must also be
taken into account in the development of readers. Modern readers thus often operate using I/Q
demodulators in order to ensure that the transponder’s signal can always be demodulated.
4.2.6.7
Read Range
Two conditions must be fulﬁlled for a reader to be able to communicate with a transponder.
First, the transponder must be supplied with sufﬁcient power for its activation. We have already
discussed the conditions for this in Section 4.2.6.2. Furthermore, the signal reﬂected by the transpon-
der must still be sufﬁciently strong when it reaches the reader for it to be able to be detected without
errors. The sensitivity of a receiver indicates how great the ﬁeld strength or the induced voltage
U must be at the receiver input for a signal to be received without errors. The level of noise that
travels through the antenna and the primary stage of the receiver input, interfering with signals that
are too weak or suppressing them altogether, is decisive for the sensitivity of a receiver.

In backscatter readers the permanently switched on transmitter, which is required for the activa-
tion of the transponder, induces a signiﬁcant amount of additional noise, thereby drastically reducing
the sensitivity of the receiver in the reader. This noise arises largely as a result of phase noise of the
oscillator in the transmitter. As a rule of thumb in practice we can assume that for the transponder
to be detected, the transponder’s signal may lie no more than 100 dB below the level of the trans-
mitter’s carrier signal (GTAG, 2001). In order to make a precise prediction regarding the sensitivity
of a reader, however, this value must be established for the individual case by measurement.
For the transmission of data the signal reﬂected by the transponder is modulated. It should be
noted in this connection that, as part of the process of modulation, the reﬂected power PS is broken
down into a reﬂected ‘carrier signal’ and two sidebands. In pure ASK modulation with a theoretical
modulation index of 100%6 the two sidebands would each contain 25% of the total reﬂected power
PS (i.e. P3 – 6 dB), and at a lower modulation index correspondingly less. Since the information is
transmitted exclusively in the sidebands, a lower wanted signal should be speciﬁed according to the
modulation index. The reﬂected carrier contains no information, but cannot be received by the reader
since it is completely masked by a transmission signal of the same frequency, as Figure 4.91 shows.
Let us now consider the magnitude of the power P3 arriving at the reader that is reﬂected by
the transponder.

Example of the level relationships in a reader. The noise level at the receiver of the reader lies
around 100 dB below the signal of the carrier. The modulation sidebands of the transponder can clearly be
seen. The reﬂected carrier signal cannot be seen, since the level of the carrier signal of the reader’s transmitter,
which is the same frequency, is higher by orders of magnitude
6 In practice 100% ASK modulation of the reﬂected signal cannot be achieved, since ZT would have to have an
inﬁnite value in the modulated state.

As in Equation (4.75) the received power P3 at the receiver of the reader is:
P3 = Ae·Reader · SBack
(4.109)
The radiation density SBack is found from Equation (4.67). We thus obtain:
P3 = Ae - Reader · P1 · GReader · σ
(4π)2 · r4
(4.110)
We now replace Ae−Reader by the expression in Equation (4.86), since we have already used the
gain GReader of the reader’s antenna in the radar equation:
P3 = P1 · G2
Reader · λ2
0 · σ
(4π)3 · r4
(4.111)
In the same way we replace As = σ by Equation (4.86), and thus ﬁnally obtain:
P3 = P1 · G2
Reader · λ4
0 · G2
T
(4πr)4
(4.112)
This equation naturally only applies in the case of power matching between the transponder’s
antenna and the connected consumer ZT. In practical operation the scatter aperture σ can take on
values between 0 and 4Ae, as was shown in Section 4.2.5.4. In generalised form the following
applies:
P3 = k · P1 · G2
Reader · λ4
0 · G2
T
(4πr)4

k=0..4
(4.113)
The precise value for k is found from the relationship between the radiation resistance of the
antenna Rr and the input impedance ZT of the transponder chip and can be derived from Figure 4.67.
We solve Equation (4.113) with respect to r, obtaining:
r = λ0
4π · 4

k · P1 · G2
Reader · G2


k=0..4
(4.114)
At known sensitivity of the reader’s receiver P3 min the maximum distance between transponder
and reader at which the transponder’s signal can just be received by the reader can thus be calculated
(Figure 4.92). The fact that P3 represents the total power reﬂected by the transponder must be
taken into account. The splitting of power P3 into a carrier signal and the two sidebands (i.e.
P3 = Pcarrier + PUSB + PLSB)7 has not yet been taken into account here. In order to be able to
detect a single sideband of the reﬂected, modulated signal, P3 must be correspondingly greater.
7 USB = upper sideband, i.e. the modulation sideband at the higher frequency position; LSB = lower sideband,
i.e. the modulation sideband at the lower frequency position.

Surface Waves
4.3.1
The Creation of a Surface Wave
If a voltage is applied to the electrodes of a piezoelectric crystal such as quartz (SiO2), lithium
niobate (LiNbO3) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), mechanical distortions arise in the crystal lattice
as a result of the piezo effect. This effect is used to generate surface acoustic waves on the crystal.
To achieve this, electrode structures made of approximately 0.1-µm-thick aluminium are applied
to the polished surface of a piezoelectric single crystal in the form of an electroacoustic converter.
When an alternating voltage is applied to the electroacoustic converter, surface acoustic waves – so-
called Rayleigh waves – propagate on the surface of the crystal (Meinke and Gundlach, 1992). The
deﬂections in the crystal lattice decrease exponentially as the depth increases.
The majority of the induced acoustic power is thus concentrated within a thin layer with a depth
of approximately one wavelength λ on the surface of the crystal. The propagation of a surface
acoustic wave on the highly polished surface of a substrate is almost undamped and dispersion
free. The propagation speed v is approximately 3000 to 4000 m/s, i.e. only around 1/100 000 of the
speed of light c.

Physical Principles of RFID Systems
145
Interdigital electrode structures in the form of interleaved ﬁngers make effective electroacoustic
transducers. Each pair of such interleaved ﬁngers (Figure 4.93) form a so-called interdigital trans-
ducer (Latin digitus = ﬁnger, inter = between). A δ-shaped (sharp spike) electrical pulse applied
to the busbar of an interdigital transducer results in a mechanical deformation at the surface of the
substrate between ﬁngers of different polarity due to the piezoelectric effect. This deformation is
proportional to the electric ﬁeld and propagates as a surface wave in both directions at velocity v
(Figure 4.94). Conversely, a surface wave entering the converter generates a signal proportional to
the ﬁnger structure at the busbar as a result of the piezoelectric effect (Meinke and Gundlach, 1992).

RFID Handbook
The distance between two ﬁngers of the same polarity is termed the electrical period q of the
interdigital transducer. The maximum electroacoustic interaction is obtained at the frequency f0,
the mid-frequency of the transducer. At this frequency the wavelength λ0 of the surface acoustic
wave precisely corresponds with the electrical period q of the interdigital transducer, so that all
wave trains are superimposed in-phase and transmission is maximized (Reindl and M´agori, 1995).

(4.115)
The relationship between the electrical and mechanical power density of a surface wave is
described by the material-dependent piezoelectric coupling coefﬁcient k2. Around k−2 overlaps of
the transducer are required to convert the entire electrical power applied to the interdigital transducer
into the acoustic power of a surface wave.
The bandwidth B of a transducer can be inﬂuenced by the length of the converter and is:
B = 2f0/N(N = number of ﬁngers)
(4.116)
4.3.2
Reﬂection of a Surface Wave
If a surface wave meets a mechanical or electrical discontinuity on the surface a small part of
the surface wave is reﬂected. The transition between free and metallised surface represents such a
discontinuity, therefore a periodic arrangement of N reﬂector strips can be used as a reﬂector. If
the reﬂector period p (see Figure 4.95) is equal to half a wavelength λ0, then all reﬂections are
superimposed in phase. The degree of reﬂection thus reaches its maximum value for the associated
frequency, the so-called Bragg frequency fB (Figure 4.96).
fB = v

crystal. The interdigital transducer itself can be seen to the bottom left of the picture. An electric alternating
voltage at the electrodes of the interdigital transducer generates a surface wave in the crystal lattice as a result
of the piezoelectric effect. Conversely, an incoming surface wave generates an electric alternating voltage of
the same frequency at the electrodes of the transducer (reproduced by permission of Siemens AG, ZT KM,

4.3.3
Functional Diagram of SAW Transponders
A surface wave transponder is created by the combination of an interdigital transducer and several
reﬂectors on a piezoelectric monocrystal, with the two busbars of the interdigital transducer being
connected by a (dipole) antenna.
A high-frequency interrogation pulse is emitted by the antenna of a reader at periodic intervals.
If a surface wave transponder is located in the interrogation zone of the reader part of the power
emitted is received by the transponder’s antenna and travels to the terminals of the interdigital
converter in the form of a high-frequency voltage pulse. The interdigital transducer converts part
of this received power into a surface acoustic wave, which propagates in the crystal at right angles
to the ﬁngers of the transducer.8
Reﬂectors are now applied to the crystal in a characteristic sequence along the propagation path
of the surface wave. At each of the reﬂectors a small part of the surface wave is reﬂected and
runs back along the crystal in the direction of the interdigital transducer. Thus a number of pulses
are generated from a single interrogation pulse. In the interdigital transducer the incoming acoustic

8 To convert as much of the received power as possible into acoustic power, ﬁrst the transmission frequency f0 of
the reader should correspond with the mid-frequency of the interdigital converter. Secondly, however, the number
of transducer ﬁngers should be matched to the coupling coefﬁcient k2.

pulses are converted back into high-frequency voltage pulses and are emitted from the antenna
of the transponder as the transponder’s response signal. Due to the low propagation speed of the
surface wave the ﬁrst response pulses arrive at the reader after a delay of a few microseconds. After
this time delay the interference reﬂections from the vicinity of the reader have long since decayed
and can no longer interfere with the transponder’s response pulse. Interference reﬂections from a
radius of 100 m around the reader have decayed after around 0.66 µs (propagation time for 2 × 100
m). A surface wave on a quartz substrate (v = 3158 m/s) covers 2 mm in this time and thus just
reaches the ﬁrst reﬂectors on the substrate. This type of surface wave transponder is therefore also
known as ‘reﬂective delay lines’.
Surface wave transponders are completely linear and thus respond with a deﬁned phase in relation
to the interrogation pulse (see Figure 4.99). Furthermore, the phase angle φ2−1 and the differential

propagation time τ2−1 between the reﬂected individual signals is constant. This gives rise to the
possibility of improving the range of a surface wave transponder by taking the mean of weak
transponder response signals from many interrogation pulses. Since a read operation requires only
a few microseconds, several hundreds of thousands of read cycles can be performed per second.
The range of a surface wave transponder system can be determined using the radar equation (see
Section 4.2.4.1). The inﬂuence of coherent averaging is taken into account as ‘integration time’ tI
(Reindl et al., 1998a).

The relationship between the number of read cycles and the range of the system is shown in
Figure 4.99 for two different frequency ranges. The calculation is based upon the system parameters
listed in Table 4.9, which are typical of surface wave systems.
4.3.4
The Sensor Effect
The velocity v of a surface wave on the substrate, and thus also the propagation time τ and the
mid-frequency f0 of a surface wave component, can be inﬂuenced by a range of physical variables
(Reindl and M´agori, 1995). In addition to temperature, mechanical forces such as static elongation,
compression, shear, bending and acceleration have a particular inﬂuence upon the surface wave
velocity v. This facilitates the remote interrogation of mechanical forces by surface wave sensors
(Reindl and M´agori, 1995).
In general, the sensitivity S of the quantity x to a variation of the inﬂuence quantity y can be
deﬁned as:
Sx
y = 1
x · ∂x
∂y
(4.119)
The sensitivity S to a certain inﬂuence quantity y is dependent here upon substrate material and
crystal section. For example, the inﬂuence of temperature T upon propagation speed v for a surface
wave on quartz is zero. Surface wave transponders are therefore particularly temperature stable on
this material. On other substrate materials the propagation speed v varies with the temperature T .

The temperature dependency is described by the sensitivity Sv
T (also called the temperature
coefﬁcient Tk). The inﬂuence of temperature on the propagation speed v, the mid-frequency f0 and
the propagation time τ can be calculated as follows (Reindl and M´agori, 1995):
v(T ) = v(T0) · [1 −Sv
T · (T −T0)]
(4.120)
f0(T ) = f0(T0) · [1 −Sv

Reﬂective Delay Lines
If only the differential propagation times or the differential phases between the individual reﬂected

transponder. The differential propagation time τ2−1, and the differential phase θ2−1 between two
received response pulses is obtained from the distance L2−1 between the two reﬂectors, the velocity
v of the surface wave and the frequency f of the interrogation pulse.
τ2−1 = 2 · L2−1

(4.123)
ϕ2−1 = 2πf · τ2−1 = 4πf · L2−1

(4.124)
The measurable change τ2−1 or θ2−1 when a physical quantity y is changed by the amount
y is thus:
τ2−1 = τ2−1 · Sτ
y · y
(4.125)
ϕ2−1 = 2πf · τ2−1 · Sτ
y · y
(4.126)
The inﬂuence of the physical quantity y on the surface wave transponder can thus be determined
only by the evaluation of the phase difference between the different pulses of the response
signal. The measurement result is therefore also independent of the distance between reader
and transponder.
For lithium niobate (LiNbO3, YZ section), the linear temperature coefﬁcient Tk = Sv
T is approxi-
mately 90 ppm/ ◦C. A reﬂective delay line on this crystal is thus a sensitive temperature sensor that
can be interrogated by radio. Figure 4.101 shows the example of the pulse response of a temperature
sensor and the temperature dependency of the associated phase values (Reindl et al., 1998c). The
precision of a temperature measurement based upon the evaluation of the associated phase value
θ2−1 is approximately ±0.1 ◦C and this precision can even be increased by special measures such
as the use of longer propagation paths L2−1 (see Equation 4.124) in the crystal. The unambiguity
of the phase measurement can be assured over the entire measuring range by three or four correctly
positioned reﬂectors.
4.3.4.2
Resonant Sensors
In a reﬂective delay line the available path is used twice. However, if the interdigital transducer
is positioned between two fully reﬂective structures, then the acoustic path can be used a much
greater number of times due to multiple reﬂection. Such an arrangement (see Figure 4.101) is
called a surface wave one-port resonator. The distance between the two reﬂectors must be an
integer multiple of the half-wavelength λ0 at the resonant frequency f1.
The number of wave trains stored in such a resonator will be determined by its loaded Q factor.
Normally a Q factor of 10 000 is achieved at 434 MHz and at 2.45 GHz a Q factor of between 1500
and 3000 is reached (Reindl et al., 1998b). The displacement of the mid-frequency f1 and the
displacement of the associated phase θ1 of a resonator due to a change of the physical quantity
y with the loaded Q factor are (Reindl et al., 1998a):
f1 = −f1(y0) · Sy,1 · y
(4.127)
and
ϕ = 2Q · f
f
(4.128)
where f1 is the unaffected resonant frequency of the resonator.
In practice, the same sensitivity is obtained as for a reﬂective delay line, but with a signiﬁcant
reduction in chip size (Reindl et al., 1998c).

permission of Siemens AG, ZT KM, Munich)
If, instead of one resonator, several resonators with different frequencies are placed on a crystal
(Figure 4.103), then the situation is different: instead of a pulse sequence in the time domain, such
an arrangement emits a characteristic line spectrum back to the interrogation device (Reindl et al.,
1998c, d) which can be obtained from the received sensor signal by a Fourier transformation.
The difference f2−1 between the resonant frequencies of the two resonators is determined to
measure a physical quantity y in a surface wave transponder with two resonators. Similarly to
Equation (4.127), this yields the following relationship (Reindl et al., 1998c).

Impedance Sensors
Using surface wave transponders, even conventional sensors can be passively interrogated by radio
if the impedance of the sensor changes as a result of the change of a physical quantity y (e.g.

is used as a reﬂector and connected to the external sensor (Figure 4.105). A measured quantity y
thus changes the terminating impedance of the additional interdigital transducer. This changes the
acoustic transmission and reﬂection ρ of the converter that is connected to this load, and thus also
changes the magnitude and phase of the reﬂected RF pulse, which can be detected by the reader.

Switched Sensors
Surface wave transponders can also be passively recoded (Figure 4.106). As is the case for an
impedance sensor, a second interdigital transducer is used as a reﬂector. External circuit elements
of the interdigital transducer’s busbar make it possible to switch between the states ‘short-circuited’
and ‘open’. This signiﬁcantly changes the acoustic transmission and reﬂection ρ of the transducer
and thus also the magnitude and phase of the reﬂected RF impulse that can be detected by the reader.

Frequency Ranges and Radio
Licensing Regulations
5.1
Frequency Ranges Used
Because RFID systems generate and radiate electromagnetic waves, they are legally classiﬁed as
radio systems. The function of other radio services must under no circumstances be disrupted or
impaired by the operation of RFID systems. It is particularly important to ensure that RFID systems
do not interfere with nearby radio and television, mobile radio services (police, security services,
industry), marine and aeronautical radio services and mobile telephones.
The need to exercise care with regard to other radio services signiﬁcantly restricts the range of
suitable operating frequencies available to an RFID system. During the RFID technology’s early
days only internationally available ISM frequencies and the frequency range below 135 kHz could
be used due to the nonassignment of separate frequencies. ISM stands for ‘Industrial Scientiﬁc and
Medical’, i.e. for industrial, scientiﬁc and medical high-frequency applications. ISM frequencies
are internationally reserved for applications using high-frequency devices. Examples are electrical
discharge machines, microwave ovens or medical short-wave radiotherapy.
In addition to these applications, ISM frequencies can also be used for radio transmission. Due to
the interference radiation inevitably caused by ‘actual’ ISM application, ISM frequencies of radio
applications close to high-frequency devices are prone to interference. In our modern communication
society, radio frequencies are a valuable commodity which should be used efﬁciently. Therefore
it appeared sensible to reserve ISM frequencies for radio applications that are able to temporarily
tolerate interferences and that have to bridge only short distances. The original idea was that anyone,
including RFID applications, could use radio devices – without any costs and separate frequency
allocation – on ISM frequencies (Bundesnetzagentur, n.d.). Today, ISM frequency bands are used
by innumerable low-price radio installations (e.g. the 27 MHz, 433 MHz and 2.45 GHz range). It
should always be taken into account that for a generous frequency usage it is not possible to ensure
protection against interference.
Two classical ISM frequencies – 13.56 MHz and 2.45 GHz – are still used intensely for RFID
systems today. Probably, the worldwide availability of these ISM frequencies and the possibility to
use transponders and readers internationally without modiﬁcations in many countries has decisively
contributed to the international triumph of RFID systems.

AVAILABLE & PRACTICAL RFID FREQUENCIES
Figure 5.1
The frequency ranges available for RFID systems range from the myriametric range below 135 kHz,
through short wave and ultrashort wave to the microwave range, with the highest frequency being 24 GHz. In
the frequency range above 135 kHz the ISM bands available worldwide are preferred
Due to the growing commercial importance of RFID systems and the increasingly liberal fre-
quency regulation in Europe and other regions, from around the year 2000, new frequency ranges
for RFID systems have been created or the conditions for existing (ISM) frequencies have been
improved. Thus, in Europe the frequency range between 865 and 868 MHz has been reserved for
UHF backscatter systems. RFID systems with a ﬁeld strength of up to 60 dB µA/m, measured at a
distance of 10 m, can be operated on the classical ISM frequency 13.56 MHz. Other applications
may only use 42 dB µA/m on this frequency. RFID systems are not generally classiﬁed as ISM appli-
cations any longer, but are treated in Europe as a separate application of short-range devices (SRD).
Short-range devices are versatile devices for professional and private use, such as model remote
controls, garage door openers, central locking systems, outdoor thermometers, motion detectors,
avalanche transceivers, low-capacity radio devices for medical implants, article surveillance, Blue-
tooth, vehicle identiﬁcation for rail vehicles, trafﬁc telematics and distance warning devices, radio
motion sensors, alarm radio installations, inductive radio applications, wireless microphones, RFID
systems, WLAN and many more.
The use of short-range device provides several advantages for the user: SRD frequencies are
allocated for general public usage. This means that SRD use has neither to be registered nor autho-
rized and no costs are associated to the use of these frequencies (Bundesnetzagentur, n.d.). Finally,
SRD can be used in several European countries under the same conditions (see also Section 5.3.1).
In addition to ISM and SRD frequencies, the entire frequency range below 135 kHz (in North and
South America and Japan < 400 kHz) is also suitable, because it is possible to work with high mag-
netic ﬁeld strengths in this range, particularly when operating inductively coupled RFID systems.
The most important frequency ranges for RFID systems are therefore 0–135 kHz, the classical
ISM frequencies around 6.78 MHz, 13.56 MHz, 27.125 MHz, 40.68 MHz, 869.0 MHz, 2.45 GHz,
5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz as well as the European SRD frequencies between 865 and 868 MHz
(915 MHz in the US).

An overview of the estimated distribution of RFID transponders at the various frequencies is
shown in Figure 5.2.
5.1.1
Frequency Range 9–135kHz
The range below 135 kHz is heavily used by other radio services. The propagation conditions in
this long-wave frequency range permit the radio services that occupy this range to reach areas
within a radius of over 1000 km continuously at a low technical cost. Typical radio services in
this frequency range are aeronautical and marine navigational radio services (LORAN C, OMEGA,
DECCA), time signal services, and standard frequency services, plus military radio services. Thus,
in central Europe the time signal transmitter DCF 77 in Mainﬂingen can be found at around the
frequency 77.5 kHz. An RFID system operating at this frequency would therefore cause the failure
of all radio clocks within a radius of several hundred metres around a reader.
In order to prevent such collisions, the licensing regulations have deﬁned several protected zones,
e.g. between 70 and 119 kHz, with low ﬁeld strengths which makes this range unattractive to RFID
systems.
Wire-bound carrier systems also operate at the frequencies 100, 115 and 130. These include, for
example, intercom systems that use the 220 V supply main as a transmission medium. The radio
services permitted to operate in Germany within this frequency range are shown in Table 5.2. The
actual frequency allocation, particularly in the range 119–135 kHz, has fallen sharply. For example,
the German weather service (DWD) changed the frequency of its weather fax transmissions to
134.2 kHz as early as mid-1996.

5.1.2
Frequency Range 6.78MHz (ISM)
The range 6.765–6.795 MHz belongs to the shortwave frequencies. The propagation conditions in
this frequency range only permit short ranges of up to a few 100 km in the daytime. During the
night-time hours, transcontinental propagation is possible. This frequency range is used by a wide
range of radio services, for example broadcasting, weather and aeronautical radio services and press
agencies.
This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU and is being used in
individual cases by RFID systems. CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised
frequency in the CEPT/ERC 70–03 regulation (see Section 5.3.1).

5.1.3
Frequency Range 13.56MHz (ISM, SRD)
The range 13.553–13.567 MHz is located in the middle of the short-wavelength range. The propa-
gation conditions in this frequency range permit (due to powerful shortwave transmitters) transcon-
tinental connections throughout the day. This frequency range is used by a wide variety of radio
services (Siebel, 1983), for example press agencies and telecommunications (PTP).
This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive CEPT/ERC
REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency. Other ISM
applications that operate in this frequency range are remote control systems, remote controlled
models, demonstration radio equipment and pagers.
This frequency range is the one most frequently used for RFID systems (see also Figure 5.2).
The European regulations allows RFID systems on this frequency – as opposed to traditional ISM
applications – to operate as SRD applications with a higher ﬁeld strength (see Section 5.3.1.4).
5.1.4
Frequency Range 27.125MHz (ISM)
The frequency range 26.565–27.405 is allocated to CB radio across the entire European continent as
well as in the USA and Canada. Unregistered and non-chargeable radio systems with transmit power
up to 4 W permit radio communication between private participants over distances of up to 30 km.
The ISM range between 26.957 and 27.283 MHz is located approximately in the middle of the
CB radio range. This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive
CEPT/ERC REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency.
ISM applications operating in this frequency range include diathermic apparatus (medical appli-
cation), high-frequency welding equipment (industrial application), remote controlled models and
baby intercoms.
The most important RFID application in this frequency range is Eurobalise for transmitting
placemarks and speed limits to rail vehicles (see Section 13.8.1).
When installing 27 MHz RFID systems for industrial applications, particular attention should be
given to any high-frequency welding equipment that may be located in the vicinity. RF welding
equipment generates high ﬁeld strengths, which may interfere with the operation of RFID systems

160
RFID Handbook
operating at the same frequency in the vicinity. When planning 27 MHz RFID systems for hospitals
(e.g. access systems), consideration should be given to any diathermic apparatus that may be present.
5.1.5
Frequency Range 40.680MHz (ISM)
The range 40.660–40.700 MHz is located at the lower end of the VHF range. The propagation
of waves is limited to the ground wave, so damping due to buildings and other obstacles is less
marked. The frequency ranges adjoining this ISM range are occupied by mobile commercial radio
systems (forestry, motorway management) and by television broadcasting (VHF range I).
The main ISM applications that are operated in this range are telemetry (transmission of measur-
ing data) and remote control applications. The author knows of no RFID systems operating in this
range, which can be attributed to the unsuitability of this frequency range for this type of system. The
ranges that can be achieved with inductive coupling in this range are signiﬁcantly lower than those
that can be achieved at all the lower frequency ranges that are available, whereas the wavelengths of
7.5 m in this range are unsuitable for the construction of small and cheap backscatter transponders.
This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive CEPT/ERC
REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency.
5.1.6
Frequency Range 433.920MHz (ISM)
The frequency range 430.000–440.000 MHz is allocated to amateur radio services worldwide.
Radio amateurs use this range for voice and data transmission and for communication via relay
radio stations or home-built space satellites.
The propagation of waves in this UHF frequency range occurs approximately optically. A strong
damping and reﬂection of incoming electromagnetic waves occurs when buildings and other obsta-
cles are encountered. Depending upon the operating method and transmission power, systems used
by radio amateurs can bridge distances of 30–300 km.
The ISM range 433.050–434.790 MHz is located approximately in the middle of the amateur
radio band. This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive
CEPT/ERC REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency.
This ISM band is extremely heavily occupied by a wide range of ISM applications. In addition
to baby intercoms, mainly telemetry transmitters (including those for domestic applications, e.g.
wireless external thermometers), cordless headphones, unregistered LPD walkie-talkies for short-
range radio, keyless entry systems (handheld transmitters for vehicle central locking) and many other
applications are crammed into this frequency range. Unfortunately, mutual interference between the
wide range of ISM applications is not uncommon in this frequency range. If possible RFID systems
should avoid this frequency band and use the UHF frequency range instead.
5.1.7
UHF Frequency Range
The wave propagation in this UHF frequency range is quasi-optical. Buildings and other obstacles
cause a strong dampening and reﬂection of the incident electromagnetic wave.
5.1.7.1
Frequency Range 865.0 MHz (SRD)
The frequency range 868–870 MHz has been available for short-range devices (SRDs) in Europe
since the end of 1997 and is thus available for RFID applications, even if only with low transmitting
power.

Frequency Ranges and Radio Licensing Regulations
161
In 2004 a new frequency range of 865–868 MHz was introduced for RFID systems. It provides
a substantially higher transmitting power. However, this frequency range is not yet really available
in all 43 CEPT member states (see Section 5.3.1.5).
Neighbouring frequency ranges are occupied primarily by GSM telephones (GSM-900, e.g. the
D network in Germany) and cordless telephones as described in the CT1 + and CT2 standards.
5.1.7.2
Frequency Range 915.0 MHz
Outside Europe, various segments are available in the frequency range 860–950 MHz: In North
America between 902–928 MHz (915 MHz), in Japan 950–965 MHz, in Korea 910–915 MHz, in
Australia 918–926 MHz, in South Africa 913–915 MHz, and a range around 915 MHz in China
(Clasen et al. 2005).
5.1.8
Frequency Range 2.45GHz (ISM, SRD)
The ISM range 2.400–2.4835 GHz partially overlaps with the frequency ranges used by amateur
radio and radio location services. The propagation conditions for this UHF frequency range and
the higher-frequency SHF range are quasi-optical. Buildings and other obstacles behave as good
reﬂectors and damp an electromagnetic wave very strongly at transmission (passage).
Typical ISM applications that can be found in this frequency range are telemetry transmitters
and PC LAN systems for the wireless networking of PCs.
This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive CEPT/ERC
REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency. The European
regulations allows RFID systems on this frequency – as opposed to traditional ISM applications – to
operate as SRD applications with a higher transmitting power (see Section 5.3.1.5).
5.1.9
Frequency Range 5.8GHz (ISM, SRD)
The ISM range 5.725–5.875 GHz partially overlaps with the frequency ranges used by amateur
radio and radio location services.
Typical ISM applications for this frequency range are movement sensors, which can be used as
door openers (in shops and department stores), or contactless toilet ﬂushing.
The most common RFID application in this frequency range is toll registration (RTTT, Road
Transport and Trafﬁc Telematics).
This range has been designated an ISM band by the international ITU. In directive CEPT/ERC
REC 70-03, CEPT/ERC and ETSI designate this range as a harmonised frequency. The European
regulations allows RFID systems on this frequency – as opposed to traditional ISM applications – to
operate as SRD applications with a higher transmitting power (see Section 5.3.1.3).
5.1.10
Frequency Range 24.125GHz
The ISM range 24.00–24.25 GHz overlaps partially with the frequency ranges used by amateur
radio and radio location services plus earth resources services via satellite.
Also this frequency range is used primarily by movement sensors, but also directional radio sys-
tems for data transmission. The author knows of no RFID systems operating in this frequency range.

5.1.11
Selection of a Suitable Frequency for Inductively
Coupled RFID Systems
The characteristics of the few available frequency ranges should be taken into account when select-
ing a frequency for an inductively coupled RFID system. The usable ﬁeld strength in the operating
range of the planned system exerts a decisive inﬂuence on system parameters. This variable there-
fore deserves further consideration. In addition, the bandwidth (mechanical) dimensions of the
antenna coil and the availability of the frequency band should also be considered.
The path of ﬁeld strength of a magnetic ﬁeld in the near- and far-ﬁeld was described in detail
in Section 4.2.1.1. We learned that the reduction in ﬁeld strength with increasing distance from the
antenna was 60 dB/decade initially, but that this falls to 20 dB/decade after the transition to the far-
ﬁeld at a distance of λ/2π. This behaviour exerts a strong inﬂuence on the usable ﬁeld strengths in
the system’s operating range. Regardless of the operating frequency used, the regulation EN 300 330
speciﬁes the maximum magnetic ﬁeld strength at a distance of 10 m from a reader (Figure 5.3).
If we move from this point in the direction of the reader, then, depending upon the wavelength,
the ﬁeld strength increases initially at 20 dB/decade. At an operating frequency of 6.78 MHz the
ﬁeld strength begins to increase by 60 dB/decade at a distance of 7.1 m – the transition into the
near-ﬁeld. However, at an operating frequency of 27.125 MHz this steep increase does not begin
until a distance of 1.7 m is reached.
It is not difﬁcult to work out that, given the same ﬁeld strength at a distance of 10 m, higher
usable ﬁeld strengths can be achieved in the operating range of the reader (e.g. 0–10 cm) in a
lower frequency ISM band than would be the case in a higher frequency band. At < 135 kHz the
relationships are even more favourable, ﬁrst because the permissible ﬁeld strength limit is much

Different permissible ﬁeld strengths for inductively coupled systems measured at a distance of
10 m (the distance speciﬁed for licensing procedures) and the difference in the distance at which the reduction
occurs at the transition between near- and far-ﬁeld lead to marked differences in ﬁeld strength at a distance of
1 m from the antenna of the reader. For the ﬁeld strength path at a distance under 10 cm, we have assumed
that the antenna radius is the same for all antennas

of Texas Instruments)
higher than it is for ISM bands above 1 MHz, and second because the 60 dB increase takes effect
immediately, because the near-ﬁeld in this frequency range extends to at least 350 m.
If we measure the range of an inductively coupled system with the same magnetic ﬁeld strength H
at different frequencies we ﬁnd that the range is maximised in the frequency range around 10 MHz
(Figure 5.4). This is because of the proportionality Uin d∼ω. At higher frequencies around 10 MHz
the efﬁciency of power transmission is signiﬁcantly greater than at frequencies below 135 kHz.
However, this effect is compensated by the higher permissible ﬁeld strength at 135 kHz, and
therefore in practice the range of RFID systems is roughly the same for both frequency ranges.
At frequencies above 10 MHz the L/C relationship of the transponder resonant circuit becomes
increasingly unfavourable, so the range in this frequency range starts to decrease.
Overall, the following preferences exist for the various frequency ranges:
<135 kHz Preferred for large ranges and low-cost transponders.
• High level of power available to the transponder.
• The transponder has a low power consumption due to its lower clock frequency.
• Miniaturised transponder formats are possible (animal ID) due to the use of ferrite coils in the
transponder.
• Low absorption rate or high penetration depth in nonmetallic materials and water (the high
penetration depth is exploited in animal identiﬁcation by the use of the bolus, a transponder
placed in the rumen).
6.78 MHz Can be used for low-cost and medium-speed transponders.
• Worldwide ISM frequency according to ITU frequency plan; however, this is not used in some
countries (i.e. licence may not be used worldwide).
• Available power is a little greater than that for 13.56 MHz.
• Only half the clock frequency of that for 13.56 MHz.

164
RFID Handbook
13.56 MHz Can be used for high-speed/high-end and medium-speed/low-end applications.
• Available worldwide as an ISM frequency.
• Fast data transmission (typically between 106 kbit/s and 848 kbit/s).
• High clock frequency, so cryptological functions or a microprocessor can be realised.
• Parallel capacitors for transponder coil (resonance matching) can be realised on-chip.
27.125 MHz Only for special applications (e.g. Eurobalise)
• Not a worldwide ISM frequency.
• Large bandwidth, thus fast data transmission (typically 424 kbit/s).
• High clock frequency, thus cryptological functions or a microprocessor can be realised.
• Parallel capacitors for transponder coil (resonance matching) can be realised on-chip.
• Available power somewhat lower than for 13.56 MHz.
• Only suitable for small ranges.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is an international organization that works with
technical and administrative questions regarding telecommunication. Its main tasks include stan-
dardisation, allocation and coordination of radio frequencies. It also provides extensive consulting
to developing countries regarding the expansion of telecommunication services and networks.
The ITU was founded in Paris by 20 European governments on 17 May 1865 and is thus
the oldest still existing international organization. Germany is one of the founding members of the
International Telegraph Union which in 1934 was renamed International Telecommunication Union.
In 1947, ITU become a UN Specialised Agency and moved its headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland.
The highest ITU organ is the Plenipotentiary Conference. It meets every four years to deter-
mine the ITU’s strategy and policy. The ITU Council monitors whether the adopted decisions are
implemented. The Council consists of 46 elected member states and meets on an annual basis.

Frequency Ranges and Radio Licensing Regulations

A permanent Secretariat-General manages the administration and organization of the Union. It
also produces regularly reports on the development of the global environment of telecommunication
and carries out the coordination work with the United Nations and other regional or international
organizations.
The ITU’s activities are divided into three sectors. Each sector has its own ofﬁce with a director
elected by the plenipotentiary conference. One of these sectors is the Radiocommunication Sector
(ITU-R).
The ITU-R is responsible for the appropriate, balanced and economically feasible utilization of the
radio frequency spectrum. The ITU-R organizes every other or third year World Radio Conferences
that adjust the international frequency arrangement to the existing requirements (BMWi, n.d.).
For the ITU’s international frequency planning, the world was divided into three geographical
regions that require speciﬁc considerations and coordination regarding the utilization of the RF
spectrum. Region 1 consists of Europe, Africa, the Northern part of Asia (former Soviet Union)
and the Middle East. Region 2 comprises North and South America, and Region 3 consists of
Southern Asia, Australia and Oceania.
The ITU’s frequency allocation also has a wide-ranging effect on the international standardization
of the frequency ranges for RFID systems. The almost global availability of ISM frequencies (e.g.
13.56 MHz or 2.45 GHz) is due to the worldwide coordination of these frequencies by the ITU-R.
As opposed to this, there is a large variety regarding the use of UHF frequencies between 800 MHz
and 1000 MHz in these three regions, e.g. for television, mobile phones (GSM), wireless phones
and other applications. In the past, it was not necessary to internationally coordinate the frequency
for short-range devices in this frequency range, and today, such coordination will require long-term
efforts. This is the reason why frequency allocations for RFID systems in the UHF range vary
widely between the three ITU regions. In Europe (Region 1), the frequency range 865–868 MHz
is allocated to RFID systems, in the US (Region 2), the frequency range is 902–928 MHz and in
Japan (Region 3), for instance, the frequency range is 950–960 MHz.
5.3
European Licensing Regulations
In Europe, the allocation of frequency ranges is coordinated by the CEPT. The CEPT (Conf´erence
Europ´eene des Postes et T´el´ecommunications) was founded in 1959 by 19 countries. Already
ten years later, it comprised 26 member states. Founding members were the monopoly-holding
postal and telecommunications administrations. CEPT’s tasks included co-operation on commercial,
operational, regulatory and technical standardisation issues.
In 1988, CEPT created the ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) to which
the development activities regarding European Telecommunication Standards were transferred. The
ETSI also speciﬁes the measuring requirements for monitoring the conformity of SRDs (e.g. EN
300 330).
Originally, postal and telecommunications administrations were supervisory and regulatory
authorities, and at the same time, operating entities. In the 1990s, European policy demanded
unbundling business operations from regulatory and supervisory tasks. This way, the CEPT
has developed into a body of regulatory and supervisory authorities. During that time, due to
substantial political changes in Europe, a number of central and middle European countries
qualiﬁed for a CEPT membership.
Today, the CEPT has 45 member states and comprises almost the entire geographic area of
Europe. Current member states are: Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium,

Currently, the CEPT only works with sovereign and regulatory issues and has established three
committees:
• the CERP (Comit´e Europ´een de R`eglementation Postale) works with postal issues;
• the ECTRA (European Committee for Regulatory Telecommunications Affairs) works with
telecommunications issues; and
• the ERC (European Radiocommunications Committee) works with radiocommunication.
In 1991, the ERO (European Radiocommunications Ofﬁce) was founded in order to permanently
represent and support the ERC.
5.3.1
CEPT/ERC REC 70-03
This new CEPT harmonisation document entitled ‘ERC Recommendation 70–03 relating to the use
of short-range devices (SRD)’ (ERC, 2002) that serves as the basis for new national regulations in
all 45 member states of CEPT has been available since October 1997. The old national regulations
for short- range devices (SRDs) are thus being successively replaced by a harmonised European
regulation. In the current version of November 2005 the REC 70-03 also includes comprehensive
notes on national restrictions for the speciﬁed applications and frequency ranges in the individ-
ual member states of CEPT (REC 70-03, Appendix 3–National Restrictions). For this reason,
Section 5.4 of this chapter has based the discussion on national regulations in a CEPT member
state solely upon the example of Germany. Current notes on the regulation of short-range devices in
all other CEPT member states can be found in the current version of REC 70-03. The document is
available to download on the home page of the ERO (European Radio Ofﬁce), http://www.ero.dk/.
REC 70-03 deﬁnes frequency bands, power levels, channel spacing, and the transmission dura-
tion (duty cycle) of short-range devices. In CEPT members states that use the R&TTE Directive
(1999/5/EC), short-range devices in accordance with article 12 (CE marking) and article 7.2 (putting
into service of radio equipment) can be put into service without further licensing if they are marked
with a CE mark and do not infringe national regulatory restrictions in the member states in ques-
tion (Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive, 1995; see also
Section 5.4).
REC 70-03 deals with a total of 13 different applications of short range devices at the various
frequency ranges, which are described comprehensively in its own Annexes (Table 5.2).
5.3.1.1
Annex 1: Nonspeciﬁc Short-Range Devices
Annex 1 describes frequency ranges and permitted transmitting power for short-range devices that
are not further speciﬁed. These frequency ranges can expressly also be used by RFID systems, if
they comply with the speciﬁed level and power.
5.3.1.2
Annex 4: Railway Applications
Annex 4 describes frequency ranges and permitted transmission power for short-range devices
in application for rail trafﬁc applications. RFID transponder systems such as the Eurobalise S21
(see Section 13.5.1) or vehicle identiﬁcation by transponder (see Section 13.5.2) are among these
applications.
A spectral mask is deﬁned for the frequency range 27 MHz. The emissions of a reader, including
modulation sidebands, must not exceed the level deﬁned by the spectral mask.

Standardised Measuring Procedures
According to Article 12 (CE marking) and Article 7.2 (putting into service of radio equipment) of
the R&TTE Directive (1995/5/EG), radio equipment can be operated without permits, unless they are
not CE marked. Manufacturers, though, have to use appropriate procedures for checking and testing
that the equipment complies with current regulations. The ETSI (European Telecommunications
Standards Institute) has therefore developed EN standardised measuring methods for electromag-
netic compatibility and radio spectrum matters, spurious emissions and other parameters. These
standards are divided into two categories: generic standards that comprise a wide frequency range,
and speciﬁc standards that take into account speciﬁc characteristics of individual applications.
5.3.2.1
Generic Standards
The three generic standards deﬁne measuring methods for transmitters and receivers of short-range
devices that reproducibly verify compliance with the limit values deﬁned in ERC REC 70-03,
independent of the SRD application.
• EN 300 330: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Short Range
Devices (SRD); Radio equipment in the frequency range 9 kHz to 25 MHz and inductive loop
systems in the frequency range 9 kHz to 30 MHz.
Part 1: Technical characteristics and test methods
Part 2: Harmonized EN under article 3.2 of the R&TTE Directive
• EN 300 220: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Short Range
Devices (SRD); Radio equipment to be used in the 25 MHz to 1000 MHz frequency range with
power levels ranging up to 500 mW;
Part 1: Technical characteristics and test methods
Part 2: Harmonized EN under article 3.2 of the R&TTE Directive
• EN 300 440: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Short Range
Devices (SRD); Radio equipment to be used in the 1 GHz to 40 GHz frequency range;
Part 1: Technical characteristics and test methods
Part 2: Harmonized EN under article 3.2 of the R&TTE Directive
In addition to inductive radio systems, EN 300 330 also deals with electronic article surveillance
(for shops), alarm systems, telemetry transmitters, and short-range telecontrol systems, which are
considered under the collective term short-range devices (SRDs). EN 300 330 distinguishes four
product classes (Table 5.8) of inductive loop coil transmitters.
Inductive loop coil transmitters in accordance with EN 300 330 are characterised by the fact that
the antenna is formed by a wire loop with one or more windings. All the inductively coupled RFID

Classiﬁcation of the product types
Class 1
Transmitter with inductive loop antenna, in which the antenna is integrated into the device
or permanently connected to it. Enclosed antenna area <30 m2
Class 2
Transmitter with inductive loop antenna, in which the antenna is manufactured to the
customer’s requirements. Devices belonging to class 2, like class 1 devices, are tested
using two typical customer-speciﬁc antennas. The enclosed antenna area must be less
than 30 m2
Class 3
Transmitter with large inductive loop antenna, >30 m2 antenna area. Class 3 devices are
tested without an antenna
Class 4
E ﬁeld transmitter. These devices are tested with an antenna
systems in the frequency range 9 kHz to 30 MHz described in EN 300 330 belong exclusively to
class 1 and class 2 types.
In class 1 (integral antenna) and class 2 inductive loop coil transmitters the H ﬁeld of the
radio system is measured in the direction in which the ﬁeld strength reaches a maximum. The
measurement should be performed in free space, with a distance of 10 m between measuring antenna
and measurement object. The transmitter is not modulated during the ﬁeld strength measurement.
EN 300 220 covers low-power radio systems, both within the ISM bands and throughout the
entire frequency range of 25 MHz to 1000 MHz (e.g. estate radio and pagers on 466.5 MHz). RFID
systems are not explicitly stated, the frequency range below 30 MHz (27.125 MHz) is covered
by EN 300 330, whereas frequency ranges of 40.680 and 433.920 MHz are not typical for RFID
applications.
The EN 300 440 standard, entitled ‘Radio Equipment and Systems (RES); Short range devices,
technical characteristics and test methods for radio equipment to be used in the 1 GHz to 25 GHz
frequency range with power levels ranging up to 500 mW,’ forms the basis for national Euro-
pean regulations for low power radio systems. EN 300 440 classiﬁes devices according to three
types – classes I to III.
RFID systems with backscatter transponders are classiﬁed as class II systems. Further details
are governed by the CEPT recommendation T/R 60-01 ‘Low power radiolocation equipment for
detecting movement and for alert’ (EAS) and T/R 22-04 ‘Harmonisation of frequency bands for
Road Transport Information Systems (RTI)’ (toll systems, freight identiﬁcation).
Various ISM and short-range applications are classiﬁed as class I and III systems. Typical
applications in these classes are movement sensors (for alarm systems, door openers and simi-
lar applications), data transmission systems (wireless LAN for PC), remote control systems and
telemetry.
5.3.2.2
Speciﬁc Standards
In addition to generic standards, there is a number of speciﬁc standards. These standards do not only
comprise speciﬁc technical requirements regarding transmitters and receivers, but also requirements
regarding the antennas to be used.
• ETSI TR 102 436: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Installation
and commissioning of RFID Systems operating at UHF.
• EN 300 674: Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Road Transport
and Trafﬁc Telematics (RTTT); Technical characteristics and test methods for Dedicated Short
Range Communications (DSRC) transmission equipment (500 kbit/s, 250 kbit/s) operating in the
5.8 GHz Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) band.

National Licensing Regulations in Europe
In Europe, the recommendations of the ERC (European Radiocommunications Committee) serve
as the basis for national legislative and licensing regulations for radio systems. For RFID systems
REC 70-03 (short-range devices, SRD) applies. The website of the ERO (European Radio Ofﬁce)
provides current notes on the national regulation of SRDs in the member states of CEPT (see
Section 5.3.1).
In all member states of the EU and the member states of CEPT that apply the EU Directive
1999/5/EC (‘Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive’, R&TTE Directive),
SRDs can be offered for sale without further licensing (ERC, 2000). This is the case, under the
prerequisite that the applicable licensing regulations for the frequency ranges and applications in
question are adhered to. The manufacturer needs only to conﬁrm that the relevant regulations have
been adhered to for each product (EC Declaration of Conformity), which it does by displaying a
CE mark upon the product.
Notes on the procedure regarding the CE marking and sale of radio and telecommunications sys-
tems can be found on the R&TTE homepage of the EU at http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/rtte.
Basic notes on the new legislation regarding the CE marking of products can be found at
http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/newapproach/legislation/guide/legislation.htm.
5.4.1
Germany
In Germany, the licensing of RFID systems is regulated by decrees of the Federal Network Agency
for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications and Railways (http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/). The
Federal Network Agency is an independent higher federal authority operating within the Federal
Ministry of Economics and Technology and has its headquarters in Bonn. The Federal Network
Agency was created from the former Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Postal
Affairs (REGTP) which in turn originated from the Federal Ministry for Postal Affairs and Telecom-
munications (BMPT) and the Federal Ofﬁce for Postal Affairs and Telecommunications (BAPT)
and was renamed as the Federal Network Agency on 13 July 2005. The Federal Network Agency
works with liberalisation and deregulation issues in order to enhance the development of the power,
gas, telecommunications, postal, – and from 1 January 2006 – the railway infrastructure market
(Bundesnetzagentur, n.d.).

5.4.1.1
Inductive Radio Applications
In Decree 1/2005 of the Federal Network Agency – most currently amended by Decree 39/2005
(Bundesnetzagentur, n.d.), the permission of inductive radio applications was adapted to the Euro-
pean Recommendation REC 70-03 (see Section 5.3.1). Based on Article 55 of the Telecommuni-
cations Law (TKG from 26 June 2004), frequencies in the range 9–30 000 kHz were allocated to
the public for the use of inductive radio applications. The use of these frequencies is not linked to
any speciﬁc technical standard.
All radio systems that correspond to the German regulation or were put into operation in accor-
dance with the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive), and are marked accordingly
(CE marking), may be operated. Of course, national restrictions must still be adhered to.
Table 5.9 present the frequency utilization parameters. In frequency ranges (a), (b) and (e), a level
reduction of the magnetic ﬁeld strength by 3 dB per octave – starting at 30 kHz – has to be taken
into account (see also Figure 5.9). In frequency ranges (a)–(i), only frame, coil or loop antennas
with a circumference of 30 m and smaller may be used. In frequency ranges (a), (c) and (e), for small
loop antennas with an area of between 0.05 and 0.16 m2 – frequently used by RFID systems – the
maximum permissible ﬁeld strength has to be reduced by factor 10× log (area/0.16 m2).
In frequency range (o1), only RFID systems and electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems
are permitted to be operated. Frequency range (k) is preferably reserved for the use of hearing aids
and is therefore not available for RFID systems.
5.4.1.2
RFID Systems in the UHF Range
In Decree 60/2004 of the Federal Network Agency – most recently amended by Decree 7/2005

tions Law (TKG from 26 June 2004), frequencies in the ranges 865–868 MHz and 2.446–2.454 GHz
were allocated to the public for radio applications used for identiﬁcation purposes (RFID). The use
of these frequencies is not linked to any speciﬁc technical standard.
All radio systems that correspond to the German regulation or were put into operation in accor-
dance with the provisions of Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE Directive), and are marked accordingly
(CE marking), may be operated. Of course, national restrictions must still be adhered to.
Table 5.10 shows the frequency utilization parameters. The frequency range 858–868 MHz is
divided into 15 channels (K1–K15). The channel medium frequency of a channel can be calculated
as follows:
fm = 864.9 MHz + (0.2 MHz · channel number)
(5.1)
In the frequency range 865–868 MHz, readers are operated in the LBT mode (listen before talk).
Before emission, channel allocation is checked. Emission may only take place on a free channel.
Here, the receiver sensitivity threshold for recognizing channel allocation depends on the effected
radiated power of the RFID reader.
In the frequency range 2446–2454 MHz, an effected radiated power > 500 mW must not be
used outside buildings. The ﬁeld strength measured at a distance of 10 m from the building must
not exceed the ﬁeld strength generated by a 500 mW signal in the open and measured at the same
distance. If RFID applications are operated by different users within a building, the same condition
applies at the borders of the individual operating spaces.

National Licensing Regulations
5.5.1
USA
In the USA, RFID systems must be licensed in accordance with licensing regulation ‘FCC Part
15’. This regulation covers the frequency range from 9 kHz to above 64 GHz and deals with
the intentional generation of electromagnetic ﬁelds by low-power and minimum-power transmitters
(intentional radiators) plus the unintentional generation of electromagnetic ﬁelds (spurious radiation)
by electronic devices such as radio and television receivers or computer systems. The category
of low-power transmitters covers a wide variety of applications, for example cordless telephones,
biometry and telemetry transmitters, on-campus radio stations, toy remote controls and door openers
for cars. Inductively coupled or backscatter RFID systems are not explicitly mentioned in the FCC
regulation, but they automatically fall under its scope due to their transmission frequencies, which
are typically in the ISM bands, and their low transmission power.
Table 5.12 lists the frequency ranges that are important for RFID systems. In all other frequency
ranges the permissible limit values for spurious radiation given in Table 5.12 apply to RFID systems.
It should be noted here that, unlike the European licensing regulation ETS 300 330, the maximum
permissible ﬁeld strength of a reader is principally deﬁned by the electrical ﬁeld strength E. The

measuring distance is selected such that a measurement is made in the far-ﬁeld of the generated
ﬁeld. This also applies for inductively coupled RFID systems in the frequency range below 30 MHz,
which primarily generate a high-frequency magnetic ﬁeld.
5.6
Comparison of National Regulations
At ﬁrst glance, a comparison of different licensing regulations appears to be rather difﬁcult as differ-
ent countries use different measuring units and distances. In the following section, we will therefore
look at the conversion of different values for inductive as well as for UHF and microwave systems.
5.6.1
Conversion at 13.56MHz
For inductively coupled systems, the maximum permissible ﬁeld strength is stated as either electric
ﬁeld strength E in V/m (e.g. FCC Part 15) or as relative level h of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in
dB µA/m (e.g. ERC REC 70-03). In addition, the distance between measuring object and measuring
antenna varies. Typical distances are 13.56 MHz at 10 m (e.g. ERC REC 70-03 or Japan) or 30 m
(e.g. FCC Part 15). Figure 5.10 shows the curve of the magnetic ﬁeld strength of a RFID reader

Figure 5.10
Magnetic ﬁeld strength curve of an RFID reader over the distance to the antenna. The two
measuring points at a distance of 10 and 30 m result in a difference of 9.5 dB between measured ﬁeld strength
levels
at 13.56 MHz. At a distance of 10 m from the reader’s antenna, we are already in the far-ﬁeld. In
the far-ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld strength H can be easily converted into electric ﬁeld strength E using
Equation (4.63). If we calculate with levels, multiplying can be replaced by adding zo.
zo = 20 · ⊕log(zo) = 20 ⊕log(377) = 51.52 dB
(5.2)
For a constant measuring distance, the following formula can be used to convert the level of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength into a level of the electrical ﬁeld strength:
e[dBµV/m] = h[dBµA/m] + 51.52 dB
(5.3)
Converting different measuring distances does not constitute a major problem either. We know
that ﬁeld strength in a far-ﬁeld decreases at a ratio of 1/r. Using a logarithmic scale, this corresponds
to a decrease of the level by 20 dB per decade, i.e. per tenfold distance r (see also Figure 5.10, and
Equation (4.65)). We therefore extend Equation (5.3) by the contribution of a different measuring
distance:
e[dBµV/m]|r2
=
h[dBµA/m]|r1 + 51.52 dB + 20 · log(r1/r2)
(5.4)
Now, we can simply convert the ﬁeld strength level into an absolute value:
E[µV/m]|r2 = 10{h[dB µA/m]|r1+51.52 dB+20. log(r1/r2)/20}
(5.5)

178
RFID Handbook
and in the reverse direction:
h[dBµA/m]|r1 = 20 · log(E[µV/m]|r2) −51.52 −20 · log(r1/r2)
(5.6)
If we use Equation (5.5) to convert a ﬁeld strength H of 42 dB µA/m at a distance of 10 m – which
corresponds to the CEPT permissible magnetic ﬁeld strength – into an electric ﬁeld strength E at
a distance of 30 m, the resulting value is 15 848 µV/m. This value corresponds to FCC deﬁned
maximum ﬁeld strength. This does not come as a surprise as the frequency range of 13.56 MHz
(ISM frequency) has been largely internationally harmonised.
5.6.2
Conversion on UHF
Also in the frequency ranges exceeding 30 MHz, we ﬁnd different deﬁnitions of the values that
are permissible for the radiated power. They state either an electrical ﬁeld strength E at a speciﬁc
distance (e.g. FCC Part 15) or the effected radiated power ERP or EIRP of the antenna (see Section
4.2.5.2; e.g. ERC REC 70-03).
We can use Equation (4.65) to easily convert the effective radiated power EIRP into the electrical
ﬁeld strength E for any distance to the transmitting antenna.

Coding and Modulation
The block diagram in Figure 6.1 describes a digital communication system. Similarly, data transfer
between reader and transponder in an RFID system requires three main functional blocks. From
the reader to the transponder – the direction of data transfer – these are: signal coding (signal
processing) and the modulator (carrier circuit) in the reader (transmitter), the transmission medium
(channel), and the demodulator (carrier circuit) and signal decoding (signal processing) in the
transponder (receiver).
A signal coding system takes the message to be transmitted and its signal representation, and
matches it optimally to the characteristics of the transmission channel. This process involves pro-
viding the message with some degree of protection against interference or collision and against
intentional modiﬁcation of certain signal characteristics (Herter and L¨orcher, 1987). Signal coding
should not be confused with modulation, and therefore it is referred to as coding in the baseband.
Modulation is the process of altering the signal parameters of a high frequency carrier, i.e. its
amplitude, frequency or phase, in relation to a modulated signal, the baseband signal.
The transmission medium transmits the message over a predetermined distance. The only trans-
mission media used in RFID systems are magnetic ﬁelds (inductive coupling) and electromagnetic
waves (microwaves).
Demodulation is an additional modulation procedure to reclaim the signal in the baseband. As
there is often an information source (input) in both the transponder and the reader, and information
is thus transmitted alternately in both directions, these components contain both a modulator and a
demodulator. This is therefore known as a modem (modulator – demodulator), a term that describes
the normal conﬁguration (Herter and L¨orcher, 1987).
The task of signal decoding is to reconstruct the original message from the baseband-coded
received signal and to recognise any transmission errors and ﬂag them as such.
6.1
Coding in the Baseband
Binary ones and zeros can be represented in various line codes. RFID systems normally use one
of the following coding procedures: NRZ, Manchester, Unipolar RZ, DBP (differential bi-phase),
Miller, differential coding on PP (pulse pause) coding.
Various boundary conditions should be taken into consideration when selecting a suitable signal
coding system for an RFID system. The most important consideration is the signal spectrum after
modulation (Couch, 1997; M¨ausl, 1985) and susceptibility to transmission errors. Furthermore, in
the case of passive transponders (in which the transponder’s power supply is drawn from the RF

Table 6.1
Signal coding in the baseband
NRZ code
A binary 1 is represented by a ‘high’ signal and a binary 0 is represented by a ‘low’
signal. The NRZ code is used almost exclusively with FSK or PSK modulation.
Manchester
code
A binary 1 is represented by a negative transition in the half-bit period and a binary 0 is
represented by a positive transition. The Manchester code is therefore also known as
split-phase coding (Couch, 1997). This code is often used for data transmission from
the transponder to the reader, based upon load modulation using a subcarrier.
Unipolar RZ
code
A binary 1 is represented by a ‘high’ signal during the ﬁrst half-bit period, a binary 0 is
represented by a ‘low’ signal lasting for the entire duration of the bit.
DBP code
A binary 0 is coded by a transition of either type in the half-bit period, a binary 1 is
coded by the lack of a transition. Furthermore, the level is inverted at the start of
every bit period, so that the bit pulse can be more easily reconstructed in the receiver
(if necessary).
Miller code
A binary 1 is represented by a transition of either type in the half-bit period, a binary 0
is represented by the continuance of the 1 level over the next bit period. A sequence
of zeros creates a transition at the start of a bit period, so that the bit pulse can be
more easily reconstructed in the receiver (if necessary).
Modiﬁed
Miller code
In this variant of the Miller code each transition is replaced by a ‘negative’ pulse. The
modiﬁed Miller code is highly suitable for use in inductively coupled RFID systems
for data transfer from the reader to the transponder. Due to the very short pulse
durations (tpulse ≪Tbit) it is possible to ensure a continuous power supply to the
transponder from the RF ﬁeld of the reader even during data transfer.
Differential
coding
Every binary 1 to be transmitted causes a change (toggle) in the signal level, whereas
the signal level remains unchanged for a binary zero. Differential coding can be
generated very simply from an NRZ signal by using an XOR gate and a D ﬂip-ﬂop.
Figure 6.4 shows a circuit to achieve this.
Pulse-pause
coding
In pulse-pause coding (PPC) a binary 1 is represented by a pause of duration t before
the next pulse; a binary 0 is represented by a pause of duration 2t before the next
pulse (Figure 6.4). This coding procedure is popular in inductively coupled RFID
systems for data transfer from the reader to the transponder. Due to the very short
pulse durations (tpulse ≪Tbit) it is possible to ensure a continuous power supply to the
transponder from the RF ﬁeld of the reader even during data transfer.

electromagnetic wave, messages can be coded and transmitted to any point within the area. The
procedure of inﬂuencing an electromagnetic wave by messages (data) is called modulation, and an
unmodulated electromagnetic wave is called a carrier.
By analysing the characteristics of an electromagnetic wave at any point in the area, we can
reconstruct the message by measuring the change in reception power, frequency or phase position
of the wave. This procedure is known as demodulation.
Classical radio technology is largely concerned with analogue modulation procedures. We can
differentiate between amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and phase modulation, these
being the three main variables of an electromagnetic wave. All other modulation procedures are

Each modulation of a sinusoidal signal – the carrier – generates so-called (modulation) sidebands
derived from one of these three types. The procedures used in RFID systems are the digital mod-
ulation procedures ASK (amplitude shift keying), FSK (frequency shift keying) and PSK (phase
shift keying).
In every modulation procedure symmetric modulation products – so-called sidebands – are gen-
erated around the carrier. The spectrum and amplitude of the sidebands are inﬂuenced by the
spectrum of the code signal in the baseband and by the modulation procedure. We differentiate
between the upper and lower sideband.
6.2.1
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
In amplitude shift keying the amplitude of a carrier oscillation is switched between two states u0
and u1 (keying) by a binary code signal. U1 can take on values between u0 and 0. The ratio of u0
to u1 is known as the duty factor m.

Coding and Modulation
183
To ﬁnd the duty factor m we calculate the arithmetic mean of the keyed and unkeyed amplitude
of the carrier signal:
ˆum = ˆu0 + ˆu1
2
(6.1)
The duty factor is now calculated from the ratio of amplitude change ˆu0 −ˆum to the mean
value ˆum:
m = ˆum
ˆum
= ˆu0 −ˆum
ˆum
= ˆu0 −ˆu1
ˆu0 + ˆu1
(6.2)
In 100% ASK the amplitude of the carrier oscillation is switched between the carrier amplitude
values 2ˆum and 0 (on –off keying; Figure 6.6). In amplitude modulation using an analogue signal
(sinusoidal oscillation) this would also correspond with a modulation factor of m = 1 (or 100%)
(M¨ausl, 1985).
The procedure described for calculating the duty factor is thus the same as that for the calculation
of the modulation factor for amplitude modulation using analogue signals (sinusoidal oscillation).
However, there is one signiﬁcant difference between keying and analogue modulation. In keying,
a carrier takes on the amplitude ˆu0 in the unmodulated state, whereas in analogue modulation the
carrier signal takes on the amplitude ˆum in the unmodulated state.
In the literature the duty factor is sometimes referred to as the percentage carrier reduction m′
during keying:
m′ = 1 −ˆu1
ˆu0
(6.3)
For the example in Figure 6.7 the duty factor would be m′ = 0.66 (= 66%). In the case of duty
factors <15% and duty factors >85% the differences between the two calculation methods can be
disregarded.
The binary code signal consists of a sequence of 1 and 0 states, with a period duration T and
a bit duration τ. From a mathematical point of view, ASK modulation is achieved by multiplying
this code signal ucode(t) by the carrier oscillation uCr(t). For duty factors m < 1 we introduce an
additional constant (1 −m), so for this case we can still multiply uRF(t) by 1 in the unkeyed state:
UASK(t) = (m · ucode(t) + 1 −m) · uHF(t)

The spectrum of ASK signals is therefore found by the convolution of the code signal spectrum

the carrier oscillation. It contains the spectrum of the code signal in the upper and lower sideband,
symmetric to the carrier (M¨ausl, 1985).
A regular, pulse-shaped signal of period duration T and bit duration τ yields the spectrum

6.2.2
2 FSK
In 2 frequency shift keying (2 FSK) the frequency of a carrier oscillation is switched between two
frequencies f1 and f2 by a binary code signal (Figure 6.9).
The carrier frequency fCR is deﬁned as the arithmetic mean of the two characteristic frequencies
f1 and f2. The difference between the carrier frequency and the characteristic frequencies is termed
the frequency deviation fCR:
fCR = f1 + f2
2
fCR = |f1 + f2|
2
(6.5)
fCR = |f1 + f1|/2
(6.6)
From the point of view of the time function, the 2 FSK signal can be considered as the composi-
tion of two amplitude shift keyed signals of frequencies f1 and f2. The spectrum of a 2 FSK signal
is therefore obtained by superimposing the spectra of the two amplitude shift keyed oscillations.
The baseband coding used in RFID systems produces an asymmetric frequency shift keying:
τ ̸= T
2
(6.7)
In these cases there is also an asymmetric distribution of spectra in relation to the mid-frequency
fCR (M¨ausl, 1985).
6.2.3
2 PSK
In phase shift keying the binary states ‘0’ and ‘1’ of a code signal are converted into corresponding
phase states of the carrier oscillation, in relation to a reference phase. In 2 PSK the signal is
switched between the phase states 0◦and 180◦.
Mathematically speaking, the shift keying of the phase position between 0◦and 180◦corresponds
with the multiplication of the carrier oscillation by 1 and – 1.

where P is transmitter power, Ts is bit duration (= τ), f0 is centre frequency, and sin c(x) =
(sin(x)/x).
The envelope of the two sidebands around the carrier frequency f0 follows the function
(sin(x)/x)2. This yields zero positions at the frequencies f0 ± 1/Ts, f0 ± 2/TS, f0 ± n/TS. In the
frequency range f0 ± 1/TS, 90% of the transmitter power is transmitted.

6.2.4
Modulation Procedures with Subcarrier
The use of a modulated subcarrier is widespread in radio technology. In VHF broadcasting, a
stereo subcarrier with a frequency of 38 kHz is transmitted along with the baseband tone channel.
The baseband contains only the monophonic signal. The differential ‘L–R’ signal required to
obtain the left and right audio channels can be transmitted ‘silently’ by the modulation of the
stereo subcarrier. The use of a subcarrier therefore represents a multilevel modulation. Thus, in our
example, the subcarrier is ﬁrst modulated with the differential signal, in order to ﬁnally modulate
the VHF transmitter once again with the modulated subcarrier signal (Figure 6.12).
In RFID systems, modulation procedures using a subcarrier are primarily used in inductively
coupled systems in the frequency ranges 6.78, 13.56 or 27.125 MHz and in load modulation for data
transfer from the transponder to the reader. The load modulation of an inductively coupled RFID
system has a similar effect to ASK modulation of RF voltage at the antenna of the reader. Instead
of switching the load resistance on and off in time with a baseband coded signal, a low-frequency
subcarrier is ﬁrst modulated by the baseband coded data signal. ASK, FSK or PSK modulation
may be selected as the modulation procedure for the subcarrier. The subcarrier frequency itself
is normally obtained by the binary division of the operating frequency. For 13.56 MHz systems,
the subcarrier frequencies 847 kHz (13.56 MHz ÷ 16), 424 kHz (13.56 MHz ÷ 32) or 212 kHz
(13.56 MHz ÷ 64) are usually used. The modulated subcarrier signal is now used to switch the
load resistor on and off.
The great advantage of using a subcarrier only becomes clear when we consider the frequency
spectrum generated. Load modulation with a subcarrier initially generates two spectral lines at

a distance ± the subcarrier frequency fH around the operating frequency (see Figure 3.17). The
actual information is now transmitted in the sidebands of the two subcarrier lines, depending upon
the modulation of the subcarrier with the baseband coded data stream. If load modulation in the
baseband were used, on the other hand, the sidebands of the data stream would lie directly next to
the carrier signal at the operating frequency.
In very loosely coupled transponder systems the difference between the carrier signal of the
reader fT and the received modulation sidebands of the load modulation varies within the range
80–90 dB. One of the two subcarrier modulation products can be ﬁltered out and demodulated by
shifting the frequency of the modulation sidebands of the data stream. It is irrelevant here whether
the frequencies fT + fH or fT −fH are used, because the information is contained in all sidebands.

Data Integrity
7.1
The Checksum Procedure
When transmitting data using contactless technology it is very likely that interference will be
encountered, causing undesired changes to the transmitted data and thus leading to transmission
errors.
A checksum can be used to recognise transmission errors and initiate corrective measures, for
example the retransmission of the erroneous data blocks. The most common checksum procedures
are parity checks, XOR sum and CRC.
7.1.1
Parity Checking
The parity check is a very simple and therefore a very popular checksum procedure. In this proce-
dure a parity bit is incorporated into each byte and transmitted with it, with the result that 9 bits
are sent for every byte. Before data transfer takes place a decision needs to be made as to whether
to check for odd or even parity, to ensure that the transmitter and receiver both check according to
the same method.
The value of the parity bit is set such that if odd parity is used an odd number of the nine bits
have the value 1, and if even parity is used an even number of bits have the value 1. The even parity
bit can also be interpreted as the horizontal checksum (modulo 2) of the data bit. This horizontal
checksum also permits the calculation of the exclusive OR logic gating (XOR logic gating) of the
data bits.
However, the simplicity of this method is balanced by its poor error recognition (Pein, 1996). An
odd number of inverted bits (1, 3, 5, . . .) will always be detected, but if there is an even number of
inverted bits (2, 4, 6, . . .) the errors cancel each other out and the parity bit will appear to be correct.
Example
Using odd parity the number E5h has the binary representation 1110 0101 p = 0.
A parity generator for even parity can be realised by the XOR logic gating of all the data bits in
a byte (Tietze and Schenk, 1985). The order in which the XOR operations take place is irrelevant.
In the case of odd parity, the parity generator output is inverted (Figure 7.2).

LRC Procedure
The XOR checksum known as the longitudinal redundancy check (LRC) can be calculated very
simply and quickly (Figure 7.3).
The XOR checksum is generated by the recursive XOR gating of all the data bytes in a data
block. Byte 1 is XOR gated with byte 2, the outcome of this gating is XOR gated with byte 3,
and so on. If the LRC value is appended to a data block and transmitted with it, then a simple
check for transmission errors can be performed in the receiver by generating an LRC from the data
block + LRC byte. The result of this operation must always be zero; any other result indicates that
transmission errors have occurred.
Due to the simplicity of the algorithm, LRCs can be calculated very simply and quickly. However,
LRCs are not very reliable because it is possible for multiple errors to cancel each other out, and

the check cannot detect whether bytes have been transposed within a data block (Rankl and Efﬁng,
1996). LRCs are primarily used for the rapid checking of very small data blocks (e.g. 32 byte).
7.1.3
CRC Procedure
The CRC (cyclic redundancy check) procedure was originally used in disk drives, and can generate
a checksum that is reliable enough even for large data quantities. However, it is also excellently
suited for error recognition in data transfer via wire-bound (telephone) or wireless interfaces (radio,
RFID). The CRC procedure represents a highly reliable method of recognising transmission errors,
although it cannot correct errors.
As the name suggests, the calculation of the CRC is a cyclic procedure. Thus the calculation of
a CRC value incorporates the CRC value of the data byte to be calculated plus the CRC values of
all previous data bytes. Each individual byte in a data block is checked to obtain the CRC value
for the data block as a whole.
Mathematically speaking, a CRC checksum is calculated by the division of a polynomial using
a so-called generator polynomial. The CRC value is the remainder obtained from this division. To
illustrate this operation we have calculated a 4-bit CRC sum for a data block. The ﬁrst byte of the
data block is 7Fh, the generator polynomial is x4 + x + 1 = 10011.
To calculate a 4-bit CRC, we ﬁrst shift the data byte four positions to the left (eight positions for
CRC 8, etc.). The four positions that become free are occupied by the starting value of the CRC
calculation. In the example this is 00h. The generator polynomial is now gated with the data byte
by a repeated XOR operation in accordance with the following rule:
The highest value bit of the data byte is XOR logic gated with the generator polynomial. The initial
zeros of the intermediate result are deleted and ﬁlled from the right with positions from the data byte or
starting value, in order to carry out a new XOR gating with the generator polynomial. This operation is
repeated until a 4 position remainder is left. This remainder is the CRC value for the data byte.
To calculate the CRC value for the entire data block, the CRC value from the preceding data
byte is used as the starting value for the subsequent data byte.
If the CRC value that has just been calculated is appended to the end of the data block and a
new CRC calculation performed, then the new CRC value obtained is zero. This particular feature
of the CRC algorithm is exploited to detect errors in serial data transmission.
When a data block is transmitted, the CRC value of the data is calculated within the transmitter
and this value is appended to the end of the data block and transmitted with it. The CRC value

Operating principle for the generation of a CRC-16/CCITT by shift registers
of the received data, including the appended CRC byte, is calculated in the receiver. The result
is always zero, unless there are transmission errors in the received block. Checking for zero is a
very easy method of analysing the CRC checksum and avoids the costly process of comparing
checksums. However, it is necessary to ensure that both CRC calculations start from the same
initial value (Figure 7.5).
The great advantage of CRCs is the reliability of error recognition that is achieved in a small num-
ber of operations even where multiple errors are present (Rankl and Efﬁng, 1996). A 16-bit CRC is
suitable for checking the data integrity of data blocks up to 4 Kbytes in length – above this size per-
formance falls dramatically. The data blocks transmitted in RFID systems are considerably shorter
than 4 Kbytes, which means that 12- and 8-bit CRCs can also be used in addition to 16-bit CRCs.
When CRC algorithms were ﬁrst developed for disk controllers, priority was given to the real-
isation of a simple CRC processor in the form of a hardware circuit. This gave rise to a CRC
processor made up of backcoupled shift registers and XOR gates that is very simple to implement.
When calculating CRC 16 using shift registers, the 16-bit shift register is ﬁrst set to its starting
value. The calculation is then initiated by shifting the data bits, starting with the lowest in value,
into the backcoupled shift register one after the other. The backcoupling or polynomial division
is based upon the XOR logic gating of the CRC bits (Figure 7.7). When all the bits have been
shifted through the register, the calculation is complete and the content of the 16-bit CRC register
represents the desired CRC (Rankl and Efﬁng, 1996).

Multi-Access Procedures – Anticollision
The operation of RFID systems often involves a situation in which numerous transponders are
present in the interrogation zone of a single reader at the same time. In such a system – consisting of
a ‘control station’, the reader, and a number of ‘participants’, the transponders – we can differentiate
between two main forms of communication.
The ﬁrst is used to transmit data from a reader to the transponders (Figure 7.8). The transmitted
data stream is received by all transponders simultaneously. This is comparable with the simultaneous
reception by hundreds of radio receivers of a news programme transmitted by a radio station. This
type of communication is therefore known as broadcast (Abramson, n.d.).
The second form of communication involves the transmission of data from many individual
transponders in the reader’s interrogation zone to the reader. This form of communication is called
multi-access (Figure 7.9).
Every communication channel has a deﬁned channel capacity, which is determined by the
maximum data rate of this communication channel and the time span of its availability. The
available channel capacity must be divided between the individual participants (transponders)
such that data can be transferred from several transponders to a single reader without mutual
interference (collision).
In an inductive RFID system, for example, only the receiver section in the reader is available to all
transponders in the interrogation zone as a common channel for data transfer to the reader. The max-
imum data rate is found from the effective bandwidth of the antennas in the transponder and reader.
The problem of multi-access has been around for a long time in radio technology. Examples
include news satellites and mobile telephone networks, where a number of participants try to access
a single satellite or base station. For this reason, numerous procedures have been developed with
the objective of separating the individual participant signals from one another. Basically, there are
four different procedures (Figure 7.10): space division multiple access (SDMA), frequency domain
multiple access (FDMA), time domain multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access
(CDMA), otherwise known as spread-spectrum. However, these classical procedures are based upon
the assumption of an uninterrupted data stream from and to the participants (Fliege, 1996), once a
channel capacity has been split it remains split until the communication relationship ends (e.g. for
the duration of a telephone conversation).

Multi-access and anticollision procedures are classiﬁed on the basis of four basic procedures
RFID transponders, on the other hand, are characterised by brief periods of activity interspersed
by pauses of unequal length. A contactless smart card in the form of a public transport travel
card, which is brought within the interrogation zone of a reader, has to be authenticated, read and
written within a few tens of milliseconds. There may follow a long period in which no smart cards
enter the reader’s interrogation zone. However, this example should not lead us to the conclusion
that multi-access is not necessary for this type of application. The situation in which a passenger
has two or three contactless smart cards of the same type in his wallet, which he holds up to the
antenna of the reader, must be taken into account. A powerful multi-access procedure is capable
of selecting the correct card and deducting the fare without any detectable delay, even in this case.
The activity on a transmission channel between reader and transponder thus possesses a very high
burst factor (Fliege, 1996) and we therefore also talk of a packet access procedure.
Channel capacity is only split for as long as is actually necessary (e.g. during the selection of a
transponder in the reader’s interrogation zone).
The technical realisation of a multi-access procedure in RFID systems poses a few challenges
for transponder and reader, since it has to reliably prevent the transponders’ data (packages) from
colliding with each other in the reader’s receiver and thus becoming unreadable, without this causing
a detectable delay. In the context of RFID systems, a technical procedure (access protocol) that
facilitates the handling of multi-access without any interference is called an anticollision system.
The fact that a data packet sent to a reader by a single transponder, e.g. by load modulation,
cannot be read by all the other transponders in the interrogation zone of this reader poses a particular

196
RFID Handbook
challenge for almost all RFID systems. Therefore, a transponder cannot in the ﬁrst instance detect
the presence of other transponders in the interrogation zone of the reader.
For reasons of competition, system manufacturers are not generally prepared to publish the
anticollision procedures that they use. Therefore, little can be found on this subject in the tech-
nical literature, so a comprehensive survey of this subject is, unfortunately, not possible at this
point. Some examples at the end of the chapter should serve to clarify the practical realisation of
anticollision procedures.
7.2.1
Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
The term space division multiple access relates to techniques that reuse a certain resource (channel
capacity) in spatially separated areas (Fliege, 1996).
One option is to signiﬁcantly reduce the range of a single reader, but to compensate by bringing
together a large number of readers and antennas to form an array, thus providing coverage of an area.
As a result, the channel capacity of adjoining readers is repeatedly made available. Such procedures
have been successfully used in large-scale marathon events to detect the run times of marathon
runners ﬁtted with transponders (see also Section 13.9). In this application a number of reader
antennas are inserted into a tartan mat. A runner travelling over the mat ‘carries’ his transponder
over the interrogation zone of a few antennas that form part of the entire layout. A large number
of transponders can thus be read simultaneously as a result of the spatial distribution of the runners
over the entire layout.

A further option is to use an electronically controlled directional antenna on the reader, the
directional beam of which can be pointed directly at a transponder (adaptive SDMA). So various
transponders can be differentiated by their angular position in the interrogation zone of the reader.1
Phased array antennas are used as electronically controlled directional antennas. These consist of
several dipole antennas, and therefore adaptive SDMA can only be used for RFID applications
at frequencies above 850 MHz (typical 2.45 GHz) as a result of the size of the antennas. Each
of the dipole elements is driven at a certain, independent phase position. The directional diagram
of the antenna is found from the different superposition of the individual waves of the dipole
elements in different directions. In certain directions the individual ﬁelds of the dipole antenna are
superimposed in phase, which leads to the ampliﬁcation of the ﬁeld. In other directions the waves
wholly or partially obliterate each other. To set the direction, the individual elements are supplied
with an RF voltage of adjustable, variable phase by controlled phase modiﬁers. In order to address
a transponder, the space around the reader must be scanned using the directional antenna, until a
transponder is detected by the ‘searchlight’ of the reader.
A disadvantage of the SDMA technique is the relatively high implementation cost of the com-
plicated antenna system. The use of this type of anticollision procedure is therefore restricted to a
few specialised applications.
7.2.2
Frequency Domain Multiple Access (FDMA)
The term frequency domain multiple access relates to techniques in which several transmis-
sion channels on various carrier frequencies are simultaneously available to the communication
participants.
In RFID systems, this can be achieved using transponders with a freely adjustable, anharmonic
transmission frequency. The power supply to the transponder and the transmission of control signals
(broadcast) takes place at the optimally suited reader frequency fa. The transponders respond on
one of several available response frequencies f1 −fN (Figure 7.12). Therefore, completely different
frequency ranges can be used for the data transfer from and to the transponders (e.g. reader →
transponder (downlink): 135 kHz, transponder →reader (uplink): several channels in the range
433–435 MHz).
One option for load modulated RFID systems or backscatter systems is to use various independent
subcarrier frequencies for the data transmission from the transponders to the reader.
One disadvantage of the FDMA procedure is the relatively high cost of the readers, since a
dedicated receiver must be provided for every reception channel. This anticollision procedure, too,
remains limited to a few specialised applications.
7.2.3
Time Domain Multiple Access (TDMA)
The term time domain multiple access relates to techniques in which the entire available channel
capacity is divided between the participants chronologically. TDMA procedures are particularly
widespread in the ﬁeld of digital mobile radio systems. In RFID systems, TDMA procedures are
by far the largest group of anticollision procedures. We differentiate between transponder-driven
and interrogator-driven procedures.
Transponder-driven procedures function asynchronously, since the reader does not control the
data transfer. This is the case, for example, in the ALOHA procedure, which is described in more
detail in Section 7.2.4. We also differentiate between ‘switched off’ and ‘non-switched’ procedures
depending upon whether a transponder is switched off by a signal from the reader after successful
data transfer.
1 If the angle between two transponders is greater than the beam width of the directional antennas used a trans-
mission channel can be used several times.

Interrogation zone of reader
Figure 7.12
In an FDMA procedure several frequency channels are available for the data transfer from the
transponders to the reader
Transponder-driven procedures are naturally very slow and inﬂexible. Most applications therefore
use procedures that are controlled by the reader as the master (interrogator-driven). These procedures
can be considered as synchronous, since all transponders are controlled and checked by the reader
simultaneously. An individual transponder is ﬁrst selected from a large group of transponders in the
interrogation zone of the reader using a certain algorithm and then the communication takes place
between the selected transponder and the reader (e.g. authentication, reading and writing of data).
Only then is the communication relationship terminated and a further transponder selected. Since
only one communication relationship is initiated at any one time, but the transponders can be oper-
ated in rapid succession, interrogator-driven procedures are also known as time duplex procedures.
Interrogator-driven procedures are subdivided into polling and binary search procedures. All
these procedures are based upon transponders that are identiﬁed by a unique serial number:
The polling procedure requires a list of all the transponder serial numbers that can possibly occur
in an application. All the serial numbers are interrogated by the reader one after the other, until a
transponder with an identical serial number responds. This procedure can, however, be very slow,
depending upon the number of possible transponders, and is therefore only suitable for applications
with few known transponders in the ﬁeld.
Binary search procedures are the most ﬂexible, and therefore the most common, procedures. In
a binary search procedure, a transponder is selected from a group by intentionally causing a data
collision in the transponder serial numbers transmitted to the reader following a request command
from the reader. If this procedure is to succeed it is crucial that the reader is capable of determining

Examples of Anticollision Procedures
In the following subsections some of the more frequently used examples of anticollision algorithms
are discussed. The algorithms in the examples are intentionally simpliﬁed such that the functional
principle of the algorithm can be understood without unnecessary complication.
7.2.4.1
ALOHA Procedure
The simplest of all the multi-access procedures is the ALOHA procedure, which got its name from
the fact that this multi-access procedure was developed in the 1970s for ALOHANET – a radio
network for data transmission on Hawaii. As soon as a data packet is available it is sent from the
transponder to the reader. This is a transponder-driven stochastic TDMA procedure.
The procedure is used exclusively with read-only transponders, which generally have to transfer
only a small amount of data (serial numbers), this data being sent to the reader in a cyclical sequence.
The data transmission time represents only a fraction of the repetition time, so there are relatively
long pauses between transmissions. Furthermore, the repetition times for the individual transponders
differ slightly. There is therefore a certain probability that two transponders can transmit their data
packets at different times and the data packets will not collide with one another.
The time sequence of a data transmission in an ALOHA system is shown in Figure 7.14. The
offered load G corresponds to the number of transponders transmitting simultaneously at a certain
point in time t0 (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .). The average offered load G is the average over an observation
period T and is extremely simple to calculate from the transmission duration τ of a data packet:
G =
n

1
τn
T · rn
(7.1)
where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . is the number of transponders in the system and rn = 0, 1, 2, . . . is the number
of data packets that are transmitted by transponder n during the observation period.

The throughput s is 1 for the transmission duration of an error-free (collision-free) data packet
transmission. In all other cases, however, it is 0, since data was either not transmitted or could not
be read without errors due to a collision. For the (average) throughput S of a transmission channel
we ﬁnd from the offered load G:
S = G · e(−2G)
(7.2)
If we consider the throughput S in relation to the offered load G (see Figure 7.15) we ﬁnd
a maximum of 18.4% at G = 0.5. For a smaller offered load the transmission channel would be
unused most of the time; if the offered load was increased the number of collisions between the
individual transponders would immediately increase sharply. More than 80% of the channel capacity
thus remains unused. However, thanks to its simple implementation the ALOHA procedure is very
well suited to use as an anticollision procedure for simple read-only transponder systems. Other
ﬁelds of application for the ALOHA procedure are digital news networks such as packet radio,
which is used worldwide by amateur radio enthusiasts for the exchange of written messages.

The probability of success q – the probability that an individual packet can be transmitted without
collisions – can be calculated from the average offered load G and the throughput S (Fliege, 1996):
q = S
G = e(−2G)
(7.3)
Derived from this equation, some datasheets provide ﬁgures on the time necessary to reliably
read all transponders in the interrogation zone – which depends upon the number of transponders
in the interrogation zone of a reader (TagMaster, 1997).
The probability p(k) of k error-free data packet transmissions in the observation period T can
be calculated from the transmission duration τ of a data packet and the average offered load G.
The probability p(k) is a Poisson’s distribution with the mean value G/τ:2

7.2.4.2
Slotted ALOHA Procedure
One possibility for optimising the relatively low throughput of the ALOHA procedure is the slotted
ALOHA (S-ALOHA) procedure. In this procedure, transponders may only begin to transmit data
packets at deﬁned, synchronous points in time (slots). The synchronisation of all transponders
necessary for this must be controlled by the reader. This is therefore a stochastic, interrogator-driven
TDMA anticollision procedure.
2 A random number has a Poisson’s distribution if it takes on the countable number of possible values k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with a probability p(k) = λk
k! · e−λ.

202
RFID Handbook
The period in which a collision can occur (the collision interval) in this procedure is only half
as great as is the case for the simple ALOHA procedure.
Assuming that the data packets are the same size (and thus have the same transmission
duration τ) a collision will occur in the simple ALOHA procedure if two transponders want
to transmit a data packet to the reader within a time interval T ≤2τ. Since, in the S-ALOHA
procedure, the data packets may only ever begin at synchronous time points, the collision interval
is reduced to T = τ. This yields the following relationship for the throughput S of the S-ALOHA
procedure (Fliege, 1996).
S = G · e(−G)
(7.5)
In the S-ALOHA procedure there is a maximum throughput S of 36.8% for an offered load G = 1.
However, it is not necessarily the case that there will be a data collision if several data packets
are sent at the same time: if one transponder is closer to the reader than the others, that transponder
may be able to override the data packets from other transponders as a result of the greater signal
strength at the reader. This is known as the capture effect. The capture effect has a very beneﬁcial
effect upon throughput behaviour (Figure 7.16). Decisive for this is the threshold b, which indicates
the amount by which a data packet must be stronger than others for it to be detected by the receiver
without errors (Borgonovo and Zorzi, 1997; Zorzi, 1995).

The practical application of a slotted ALOHA anticollision procedure will now be considered in
more detail on the basis of an example.
The transponder used must also have a unique serial number (i.e. one that has been allocated
only once). In this example we use an 8-bit serial number; this means that a maximum of 256
transponders can be put into circulation if the uniqueness of serial numbers is to be guaranteed.

Transponder system with slotted ALOHA anticollision procedure
We deﬁne a set of commands in order to synchronise and control the transponders.
A reader in wait mode transmits a REQUEST command at cyclical intervals. We now bring ﬁve
transponders into the interrogation zone of a reader at the same time (Figure 7.17). As soon as the
transponders have recognised the REQUEST command, each transponder selects one of the three
available slots by means of a random-check generator, in order to send its own serial number to the
reader. As a result of the random selection of slots in our example there are collisions between the
transponders in slots 1 and 2. Only in slot 3 can the serial number of transponder 5 be transmitted
without errors.
If a serial number is read without errors, then the detected transponder can be selected by the
transmission of a SELECT command and then read or written without further collisions with other
transponders. If no serial number were detected at the ﬁrst attempt the REQUEST command is
simply repeated cyclically.
When the previously selected transponder has been processed, further transponders in the inter-
rogation zone of the reader can be sought by means of a new REQUEST command.
7.2.4.2.1
Dynamic S-ALOHA Procedure
As we have established, the throughput S of an S-ALOHA system is maximised at an offered load
G of around 1. This means that there are the same number of transponders in the interrogation
zone of the reader as there are slots available. If many further transponders are added, then the
throughput quickly falls to zero. In the worst case, no serial numbers can be detected, even after an

inﬁnite number of attempts because no transponder succeeds in being the only one to transmit in
one slot. This situation can be eased by the provision of a sufﬁcient number of slots. However, this
reduces the performance of the anticollision algorithm, since the system has to listen for possible
transponders for the duration of all time slots – even if only a single transponder is located in the
interrogation zone of the reader. Dynamic S-ALOHA procedures with a variable number of slots
can help here.
One possibility is to transmit the number of slots (currently) available for the transponders with
each REQUEST command as an argument: in wait mode the reader transmits REQUEST commands
at cyclical intervals, which are followed by only one or two slots for possible transponders. If a
greater number of transponders cause a bottleneck in both slots, then for each subsequent REQUEST
command the number of slots made available is increased (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, . . .) until ﬁnally an
individual transponder can be detected.
However, a large number of slots (e.g. 16, 32, 48, . . .) may also be constantly available. In
order to nevertheless increase performance, the reader transmits a BREAK command as soon as
a serial number has been recognised. Slots following the BREAK commands are ‘blocked’ to the
transmission of transponder addresses (Figure 7.18).
7.2.4.3
Binary Search Algorithm
The implementation of a binary search algorithm requires that the precise bit position of a data
collision is recognised in the reader. In addition, a suitable bit coding is required, so we will ﬁrst
compare the collision behaviour of NRZ (non-return-to-zero) and Manchester coding (Figure 7.19).
The selected system is an inductively coupled transponder system with load modulation by an ASK
modulated subcarrier. A 1 level in the baseband coding switches the subcarrier on, and a 0 level
switches it off.

Collision behaviour for NRZ and Manchester code. The Manchester code makes it possible to
trace a collision to an individual bit
NRZ Code. The value of a bit is deﬁned by the static level of the transmission channel within a
bit window (tBIT). In this example a logic 1 is coded by a static ‘high’ level; a logic 0 is coded by
a static ‘low’ level.
If at least one of the two transponders sends a subcarrier signal, then this is interpreted by the
reader as a ‘high’ level and in our example is assigned the logic value 1. The reader cannot detect
whether the sequence of bits it is receiving can be traced back to the superposition of transmissions
from several transponders or the signal from a single transponder. The use of a block checksum
(parity, CRC) can only detect a transmission error ‘somewhere’ in the data block (Figure 7.20).
Manchester code. The value of a bit is deﬁned by the change in level (negative or positive
transition) within a bit window (tBIT). A logic 0 in this example is coded by a positive transition;
a logic 1 is coded by a negative transition. The ‘no transition’ state is not permissible during data
transmission and is recognised as an error.
If two (or more) transponders simultaneously transmit bits of different values then the positive and
negative transitions of the received bits cancel each other out, so that a subcarrier signal is received
for the duration of an entire bit. This state is not permissible in the Manchester coding system and
therefore leads to an error. It is thus possible to trace a collision to an individual bit (Figure 7.20).

Table 7.4
Transponder commands for the binary search algorithm
REQUEST(SNR)
This command sends a serial number to the transponder as a parameter. If the
transponder’s own serial number is less than (or equal to) the received serial number,
then the transponder sends its own serial number back to the reader. The group of
transponders addressed can thus be preselected and reduced
SELECT_(SNR)
Sends a (predetermined) serial number (SNR) to the transponder as a parameter. The
transponder with the identical transponder address will become available for the
processing of other commands (e.g. reading and writing data). This transponder is
thus selected. Transponders with different addresses will thereafter only respond to a
REQUEST command
READ_DATA
The selected transponder sends stored data to the reader. (In a real system there are also
commands for authentication or writing, debiting, crediting, etc.)
UNSELECT
The selection of a previously selected transponder is cancelled and the transponder is
‘muted’. In this state, the transponder is completely inactive and does not even
respond to a REQUEST command. To reactivate the transponder, it must be reset by
temporarily removing it from the interrogation zone of the reader (= no power supply)

We will use Manchester coding for our binary search algorithm. Let us now turn our attention
to the algorithm itself.
A binary search algorithm consists of a predeﬁned sequence (speciﬁcation) of interactions (com-
mand and response) between a reader and several transponders with the objective of being able to
select any desired transponder from a large group.
For the practical realisation of the algorithm we require a set of commands that can be processed
by the transponder (Table 7.4). In addition, each transponder has a unique serial number. In our
example we are using an 8-bit serial number, so if we are to guarantee the uniqueness of the
addresses (serial numbers) a maximumof 256 transponders can be issued.
The use of the commands deﬁned in Table 7.4 in a binary search algorithm will now be demon-
strated, based upon a procedure with four transponders in the interrogation zone of the reader. The
transponders in our example possess unique serial numbers in the range 00–FFh (= 0–255 dec.
or 00000000 – 11111111 bin.):
The ﬁrst iteration of the algorithm begins with the transmission of the command REQUEST
(≤11111111) by the reader. The serial number 11111111b is the highest possible in our example
system using 8-bit serial numbers. The serial numbers of all transponders in the interrogation zone
of the reader must therefore be less than or equal to 11111111b, so this command is answered by
all transponders in the interrogation zone of the reader (Figure 7.21).
The precise synchronisation of all transponders, so that they begin to transmit their serial numbers
at exactly the same time, is decisive for the reliable function of the binary tree search algorithm.
Only in this manner is the determination of the precise bit position of a collision possible.
At bit 0, bit 4 and bit 6 of the received serial number there is a collision (X) as a result of the
superposition of the different bit sequences of the responding transponders. The occurrence of one
or more collisions in the received serial numbers leads to the conclusion that there are two or more

The different serial numbers that are sent back from the transponders to the reader in response
to the REQUEST command lead to a collision. By the selective restriction of the preselected address range in
further iterations, a situation can ﬁnally be reached in which only a single transponder responds

1X1X001X yields eight possibilities for the serial numbers that have still to be detected (Table 7.6).
Bit 6 is the highest value bit at which a collision has occurred in the ﬁrst iteration. This means
that there is at least one transponder both in the range SNR ≥11000000b and also in SNR ≤
10111111b.3 In order to be able to select an individual transponder, we have to limit the search
range for the next iteration according to the information obtained. We decide arbitrarily to continue

Figure 7.22
Binary search tree. An individual transponder can ﬁnally be selected by a successive reduction
of the range
our search in the range ≤10111111b. To do this we simply set bit 6 equal to 0 (highest value bit
with collision), and ignore all lower value bits by setting them to 1.
The general rule for limiting the search area (range) is shown in Table 7.7.
After the reader has transmitted the command REQUEST (≤10111111), all transponders that
fulﬁl this condition will respond by sending their own serial numbers to the reader. In our example
these are the transponders 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 7.22). There is now a collision (X) at bit 0 and bit 4 of
the received serial number. From this we can conclude that there are still at least two transponders
in the search range of the second iteration. The received bit sequence 101X001X still permits four
options for the serial numbers that remain to be detected (Table 7.8).The renewed appearance of
collisions in the second iteration necessitates a further restriction of the range in a third iteration.
The use of the rule in Table 7.7 leads us to the search range ≤10101111. The reader now transmits
to the transponders the command REQUEST (≤10101111). This condition is now only fulﬁlled by
transponder 2 (10100011), which now responds to the command alone. We have thus detected a
valid serial number – a further iteration is not necessary.
By means of a subsequent SELECT command, transponder 2 is selected using the detected
transponder address and can now be read or written by the reader without interference from other
transponders. All other transponders are silent as only a selected transponder responds to a write/read
command – READ_DATA.
After the completion of the write/read operations, transponder 2 can be fully deactivated by an
UNSELECT command, so that it no longer responds to the next REQUEST command. In this
manner the number of iterations necessary for the selection of an individual transponder can be
gradually reduced if a large number of transponders are ‘waiting’ for processing in the interro-
gation zone of the reader. In our example, running the anticollision algorithm again would thus
automatically lead to the selection of one of the previously processed transponders 1, 3 or 4.

The average number of iterations needed to determine the transponder address (serial number) of
a single transponder as a function of the number of transponders in the interrogation zone of the reader. When
there are 32 transponders in the interrogation zone an average of six iterations are needed, for 65 transponders
on average seven iterations, for 128 transponders on average eight iterations, etc
The average number of iterations L that are required to detect a single transponder from a large
number depends upon the total number of transponders N in the interrogation zone of the reader,
and can be calculated easily:
L(N) = ld(N) + 1 = log(N)
log(2) + 1
(7.7)
If only a single transponder is located in the interrogation zone of the reader, precisely one iteration
is required to detect the serial number of the transponder – a collision does not occur in this case. If
there is more than one transponder in the interrogation zone of the reader, then the average number
of iterations increases quickly, following the curve shown in Figure 7.23.
7.2.4.3.1
Dynamic Binary Search Procedure
In the binary search procedure described above, both the search criterion and the serial numbers of
the transponders are always transmitted at their full length. In practice, however, the serial numbers
of transponders do not consist of one byte, as in our example, but, depending upon the system,
can be up to 10 bytes long, which means that a large quantity of data must be transferred in order

Reader’s command (nth iteration) and transponder’s response when a 4-byte serial number has

grey). X is used to denote the highest value bit position at which a bit collision occurred in the previous
iteration
to select an individual transponder. If we investigate the data ﬂow between the reader and the
individual transponders in more detail (Figure 7.24) we ﬁnd that:
• Bits (X −1) to 0 of the command contain no additional information for the transponder since
they are always set to 1.
• Bits N to X of the serial number in the transponder’s response contain no additional information
for the reader, as they are already known and predetermined.
We therefore see that complementary parts of the transmitted serial numbers are redundant and
actually do not need to be transmitted. This quickly leads us to an optimised algorithm. Instead of
transmitting the full length of the serial numbers in both directions, the transfer of a serial number
or the search criterion is now simply split according to bit (X). The reader now sends only the
known part (N–X) of the serial number to be determined as the search criterion in the REQUEST

to the search criterion in the bits (N–X) now respond by transmitting the remaining bits, (X −1)
to 0, of their serial numbers. The transponders are informed of the number of subsequent bits by
an additional parameter (NVB = number of valid bits) in the REQUEST command.
Let us now illustrate in more detail the sequence of a dynamic binary search algorithm on
the basis of the example in Figure 7.25. We use the same transponder serial numbers as in the
previous example. Since we are applying the rule (Table 7.7) unchanged, the sequence of individual
iterations corresponds with that of the previous example. In contrast, however, the amount of data
to be transferred – and thus the total time needed – can be reduced by up to 50%.

Security of RFID Systems
Similar to any other telecommunication and information technology system, RFID systems also
face the potential risk of being spied out or manipulated. In order to better evaluate potential risks
connected to the use of RFID systems, Section 8.1 will provide a closer look at common types of
attack on RFID systems. After that, Section 8.2 will present cryptographic procedures for protecting
systems from common attacks.
RFID systems rely on that external communication channels link the data registered by the reader
to other data pools. However, security issues regarding the back-end of the RFID system are not
speciﬁc to RFID (Rikcha, 2004). Due to the scope of this book, we will limit this discussion to
attacks on the air interface between reader and transponder as well as to attacks on the transponder
itself. We will not include attacks on background systems, such as databases. Looking at the
application context in an open RFID system, we can see that it usually involves two parties with
divergent interests. The system operator forms an active party and provides the infrastructure,
i.e. the reader and background system. The active party also supplies the transponder as well as
administrates and utilizes the data that is associated with or stored on the transponder. This means,
it controls all data registered by the RFID system and how they are used (Rikcha, 2004).
On the other hand, we have the user of the RFID system, usually a customer or system operator
employee. The users form a passive party. Even though the passive party owns the transponders
(e.g. a contactless ticket, an ID or the label of a recently bought product), it is not always able to
inﬂuence the use of the transponders or the utilization of the registered data (Rikcha, 2004).
In a closed system, e.g. manufacturing control in a company via RFID, active and passive parties
are not separate. The system operator is also the user of the system. In addition, there may be a
third party, such as a hacker or competitor, trying to get unauthorised access to the data stored in
the transponder or in the system or even to manipulate the data to his or her personal advantage.
The large-scale introduction of RFID systems for product labels, passports and other IDs, as
well as contactless tickets confront the public at large with a new and unfamiliar technology
whose functionality – and thus also limits and risks – it does not really understand. The large
number of different RFID systems with a huge variety of applications substantially contributes
to the corresponding confusion. As with each new technology, RFID does therefore not only
meet curiosity, but also fear and rejection. Similar reactions occurred, when barcodes for product
labelling, the EAN code or the US UPC, were introduced in the late 1970s.
Then, and also today, the protection of the individual’s private sphere is an important debate
issue. It mainly refers to the fear that the new RFID technology could be used for the unnoticed
and undesired collection of personal data, which means that the active party can spy out the private
sphere. In recent years, civil rights initiatives and consumer protection organizations have tried to
inform the public opinion about the potential risks related to the broad usage of RFID systems.

presented the ‘RFID Right to Know Act of 2004 (SB 0867)’, that has not been passed yet, though
(Lahiri, 2005). The draft bill requires, among others, the clear and visible labelling of products that
contain an RFID chip.

Some basic attack options on RFID systems (according to Rikcha, 2004)

Security of RFID Systems
215
Attacks can be carried out for a variety of reasons. They can be grouped into four attack types:
• Spying out: The attacker tries to get unauthorized access to information and data of the active
and passive ﬁle.
• Deception:
The attacker tries to feed incorrect information into the RFID system in order to
deceive the active party, i.e. the RFID system operator, or the passive party, i.e. the user of the
RFID system.
• Denial of service: This kind of attack affects the availability of functions of the RFID system.
• Protection of privacy: The attacker considers the RFID system to be a threat to her privacy and
tries to protect herself with attacks on the RFID system.
8.1.1
Attacks on the Transponder
Usually the transponder is easily accessible. On goods and tickets it is always available to the
attacker, and in most cases even without any time restrictions. Therefore, there is a wide range of
attacks with varying degrees of effectiveness.
8.1.1.1
Permanent Destruction of the Transponder
The easiest attack on a RFID system is the mechanical or chemical destruction of the transponder.
The antenna can be easily severed or cut off, for instance. The chip can be easily snapped or
smashed.
A transponder can also be destroyed through exposure to a strong ﬁeld. Therefore, ISO/IEC 14443
or ISO/IEC 15693 speciﬁes a maximum ﬁeld strength of 12 A/m at a frequency of 13.56 Mhz for
inductively coupled transponders. If the transponder is introduced at this frequency into a ﬁeld
with a signiﬁcantly higher ﬁeld strength, the waste heat produced at the shunt regulator cannot be
sufﬁciently dissipated any longer and the transponder will be thermally destroyed. If there is no
sufﬁciently strong transmitter available for this frequency range, the transponder can also be put
into a microwave oven.
8.1.1.2
Transponder Shielding/Tuning
A very efﬁcient attack is to use metal surfaces in order to shield a transponder from the reader’s
magnetic or electromagnetic radiation. In the simplest case it is sufﬁcient to wrap a foil around
the transponder, e.g. household aluminium foil. For inductively coupled transponders, the antenna
resonant circuit can be heavily tuned by using a metal surface in its immediate surroundings. In
addition, the reader’s magnetic ﬁeld is dampened due to eddy-current losses in the metal foil.
Therefore it is often sufﬁcient to fasten the transponder on one side to a metal surface. It reﬂects
the electromagnetic ﬁelds of a UHF backscatter system (e.g. 868 MHz) and efﬁciently keeps them
away from the transponder. In the most favourable case, a passive transponder will not even be
supplied with sufﬁcient power to operate the chip.
This kind of attack can be used to temporarily disrupt transponder operation. If the shield is
removed, the transponder becomes operable again without restrictions. Today, people with limited
technological knowledge can use commercial products for shielding transponders (Cloaktec, n.d.).
Antennas of UHF backscatter transponders are tuned by introducing them into a dielectric, e.g.
glass or plastics. The level of tuning increases with increasing capacitivity εr and thickness of
the surrounding dielectric. The tuning decreases the interrogation sensitivity of the transponder
at the reader’s transmitting frequency, which in turn decreases the read range of such an attacked
transponder.

8.1.1.3
Spooﬁng and Cloning of Transponders
As we will see in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, there are different complex procedures for storing
information on transponders. The most basic one – the read-only transponder – has only one hard-
coded identiﬁer which is the transponder’s serial number. Figure 10.10 shows the block diagram
of such a simple transponder.
If a read-only transponder enters the sufﬁciently strong ﬁeld of a reader it immediately starts
to intermittently transmit its serial number which can be easily read by any suitable reader. The
attacker can now use discrete components to build a read-only transponder (transponder clone) and
replace the PROM containing the transponder’s serial number with a multi-programmable memory
(EPROM) or – more basically – with a series of DIP switches. If the attacker then reads out the
serial number of a transponder he can program this serial number into the transponder clone. If the
transponder clone is introduced into a reader’s ﬁeld it can send the serial number previously read
out from the genuine transponder and thus pretend the presence of this genuine transponder to the
reader (Westhues, 2005). The reader is not able to determine whether the currently received serial
number was sent by a genuine transponder or a transponder clone. The attacker does not have to
have physical access to the transponder, but only needs to use a suitable reader in order to enter
the read range of the transponder to be cloned, without being detected.
Transponders with writable memories form the next level of functionality (see Section 10.1.3.2)
constitute the next step. Often, memory sections can be read or written without any restrictions, i.e.
without requiring a password or key. Also here, an attacker can easily manipulate stored data for
his personal advantage or produce copies of the attacked transponder by reading data and copying
them to other transponders. However, the cloning of transponders can be efﬁciently prevented by
using authentiﬁcation and encrypted data transmission (see Section 8.2.1). RFID applications that
are easily accessible for attackers, such as entrance systems or ticket systems, should therefore
generally avoid read-only transponders or unencrypted access to data.
8.1.2
Attacks on the RF Interface
RFID systems are radio systems and communicate via electromagnetic waves in the near-ﬁeld and
the far-ﬁeld range. An attacker is therefore likely to try and attack an RFID system via the RF
interface. Such an attack is attractive as it does not require any physical access to the reader or
transponder, but can be carried out from a distance. Currently, the following attacks are known and
have been investigated:

• interception of the communication between reader and transponder (eavesdropping);
• interruption of the communication between reader and transponder through jamming;
• extending the read range in order to being able to skim a remote transponder, without being
detected;
• blocking a reader with DOS attacks;
• undetected use of a remote transponder through a relay attack.
8.1.2.1
The Interception of Communication (eavesdropping)
As RFID systems communicate with electromagnetic waves, systems can be generally intercepted
with very basic means. The interception of the communication between reader and transponder is
therefore one of the most prominent threats to RFID technology. The ranges given for RFID systems
vary between a few centimetres (e.g. ISO/IEC 14443, 13.56 MHz) and several metres (ISO/IEC
18000-6, 868 MHz) and apply to the active communication which even requires the transponder to
be supplied with power and to generate several volts at the antenna.
Radio receivers only need an antenna output voltage that is an order of magnitude lower in
order to receive useful signals. This gives reasonable grounds to suspect that communication can
be passively intercepted from a much larger distance.
Corresponding studies (Finke and Kelter, n.d.) show that at 13.56 MHz the communication of
inductively coupled systems can still be intercepted at a distance of 3 m. For a receiver bandwidth of
only a few kHz, the unmodulated carrier signal of a reader can be detected at a distance of several
hundred metres. However, the successful interception of the complete communication between
reader and transponder is affected by the larger receiver bandwidth required which – depending
on the bitrate – can vary between some 100 kHz and several MHz. On the one hand, the input
voltage required at the receiver increases with a ratio of Uin [dB] = √(B1 + B2) (Bensky, 2000)
with an increasing range. On the other hand, interference increases at the same rate due to partly
very strong transmitters in this shortwave frequency range.
The situation in the UHF frequency range at 868 MHz, 915 MHz or at 2.45 GHz is much more
favourable as the interception range can be signiﬁcantly improved by using beam antennas. Under
very favourable conditions, the down-link signal of a reader should be receivable over several
hundred metres, and the relatively weak backscatter signal of the transponder should be detectable
over at least several dozen metres. However, interference may be caused by metal surfaces, i.e.
fences, aluminium panels at walls, but also by large buildings in the propagation path of the waves
as they shade the signals.
8.1.2.2
Jamming
A very simple, but efﬁcient method for interrupting data transmission between transponder and
reader is to use jamming in order to send an interfering signal. When recalling the frequency
spectrum of an RFID system (see Figure 3.17), we see that in addition to the reader’s very strong
carrier signal used by passive RFID systems for supplying the transponder with power, there occur
two very weak modulation sidebands that are generated by the transponder’s load modulation (for
inductive coupling) or by modulated backscatter (for backscatter systems). In order to be able to
superimpose a reader’s strong carrier signal and thus interfere with data transmission from reader to
transponder (down-link), distance, transmission power and antenna gain or antenna diameter, respec-
tively (for inductive coupling) have to correspond at least to the reader that is used. As opposed to
this, interfering with the transponder’s weak response signal, and thus with data transmission from
transponder to reader (up-link) requires much less effort.
For a backscatter system at 915 MHz and assuming an antenna gain of G = 1 for the reading
antenna and of G = 1.64 (dipole) for the transponder antenna at a distance of slightly more than

218
RFID Handbook
3 m, the corresponding free-space attenuation will amount to 40 dB (see Table 3.7). For an effective
radiated power of 4 W EIRP, the transponder still experiences a reception power of Pe = 0.4 mW.
Therefore, power Ps reﬂected by the transponder theoretically lies in the range of 0 < Ps < 4Pe,
i.e. it has a maximum of 1.6 mW (see Figure 4.89). If a jamming device has the same distance
to the reader as the transponder and operates at the frequencies of the transponder’s modulation
sidebands, it requires only a transmission power of a few mW to cause signiﬁcant damage.
A similar relationship applies to inductively coupled systems. It has to be taken into account,
though, that the ﬁeld strength curve presented in Section 4.1.1.1 also applies to jamming. This
means that any jamming device has to be either positioned close enough to the reader or has to
use sufﬁciently large antennas or transmission power.
It is important to point out, that jamming devices are radio systems and therefore, in most
countries, operating such devices is illegal.
8.1.2.3
Reading with Extended Read Range
Extending the read range of a reader might be an interesting option for an attacker. This way, the
attacker may be able to read the transponder from a safe distance, without being detected. However,
especially regarding the read range, technical opportunities and physical limits of RFID systems are
often widely overestimated. Due to the large difference between inductive coupling and backscatter
process, we will discuss these two separately.
8.1.2.3.1
Inductive Coupling
Figure 4.29 shows the equivalent circuit diagram of an inductively coupled RFID system. Current
i1 in the antenna coil of reader L1 generates a magnetic ﬁeld which is coupled to transponder coil
L2 through mutual inductance M and induces the supply voltage of transponder UQ2. Reversely,
current i2 in the transponder coil affects via magnetic mutual inductance M its cause, i.e. current i1.
This feedback is used to transmit data from the transponder to the reader through load modulation
(see also Section 4.1.10.3).
If a transponder is moved beyond the normal read range of such RFID systems, the communica-
tion can be disrupted for two different reasons. One possible reason is that the transponder simply
does not receive sufﬁcient power from its antenna to be able to operate. Another possible reason is
that the transponder is supplied sufﬁcient power to operate, but that the amplitude of the generated
load modulation is no longer sufﬁciently large to be detected by the reader. The maximum reach
of the power supply is called the energy range of the system; as opposed to the load modulation
range, i.e. the maximum distance between transponder and reading antenna at which the reader
still is able to detect the transponder’s load modulation.
If the reader’s read distance is to be increased, we have to increase the reader’s energy range,
too. This can be done by increasing the diameter of the reader antenna and the current in the
transmitting antenna (i.e. the reader’s transmission power; see also Section 4.1.1.2). There remains
the problem that even for a constant distance between transponder and reader antenna, for an
increasing antenna diameter of the reader antenna, magnetic mutual inductance will decrease and
so will the strength of the load modulation signal. In addition, a larger transmission power of the
reader will also increase the (parasitical) noise generated by the transmitter in the frequency range
of the load modulation sidebands. Consequently, there is a rapidly reached limit that requires an
increasing technological effort in order to be able to receive the transponder’s load modulation
signal. Kﬁr and Wool (2005) state that a transponder designed according to ISO/IEC 14443, which
can be easily read by commercial readers from a distance of 10 cm, cannot be read from a distance
larger than 40 cm, even given optimization of all parameters.

8.1.2.3.2
Backscatter Coupling
Figure 4.76 presents the model of a passive backscatter system. We can recall that part of power P1
emitted by the reader’s antenna reaches the transponder’s antenna, with power Pe being necessary
to operate the transponder. Another part of the energy is then re-radiated or reﬂected by the
transponder’s antenna as power Ps. A small portion P3 of the reﬂected power eventually returns to
the reader where it can be detected and demodulated.
If the transponder moves beyond the read range of the backscatter system, the communication
can be disrupted for two different reasons. An obvious reason is an insufﬁcient energy supply Pe
of the transponder to be operated via the antenna. However, it is just as likely that the transponder
still has sufﬁcient power to operate, but that the reﬂected power Ps is no longer sufﬁciently large
to be detected by the reader. For today’s backscatter systems, the energy intake of the transponder
chip1, i.e. energy Pe required for transponder operation, is decisive for the range of a system. We
call this range the energy range of the system; as opposed to the backscatter range which is the
theoretical range of the signal reﬂected by the transponder antenna.
An obvious option for increasing the range is therefore an increased transmission power of the
reader. Looking at Equation (4.61) we see that we need to increase the transmission power of
the reader fourfold in order to double the energy range. For a doubled range we need to increase
the transmission power of the reader by sixteen in order to keep power P3 – which returns from
the transformer – at a constant level; this corresponds to Equation (4.67). A representation of the
necessary transmission power as a function of energy range and backscatter range (Figure 8.5)
shows that the two graphs intersect.
As mentioned before, we can assume that the range of most transponder systems is determined by
the system’s energy range. For a speciﬁc transmission power, the corresponding point on the energy
range’s straight line is situated to the left of the intersection. To the left of the intersection, the
range is proportional to the square root of the transmission power. When increasing the transmission
power by a factor of ten the system range may be increased by a factor of three. However, this

The necessary transmission power as a function of energy range (power supply transponder) and
backscatter range (backscatter signal)
only applies to the point where the two straight lines intersect. At any point to the right of the
intersection, the transponder still has sufﬁcient power to operate, however the signal reﬂected by
the transponder soon becomes too weak to be detected by the reader. After reaching the intersection
of the straight lines, we have to increase our transmission power by a factor of a hundred in order
to once more increase the read range by a factor of three. In order to increase the range by a factor
of 10, starting from the intersection of the two lines, we even have to increase the transmission
power by a factor of 10 000. However, this causes other effects, such as an increased sideband
noise around the reader’s carrier signal, as well as intermodulation products due to nonlinearities in
the simultaneously operated receiver of the reader which further reduces the theoretically possible
range substantially.
Returning to Figure 4.76, we see that the antenna gain of the reading antenna enters the propaga-
tion path of the signals twice. First, power P2 that reaches the transponder at distance r is ampliﬁed
by the antenna gain. Power Ps which is reﬂected by the transponder is increased by the same value.
The portion of reﬂected power P3 received by the reader is once more ampliﬁed by the antenna
gain of the reading antenna. The total effect is that both graphs in Figure 8.5 will shift to the right.
The range gained through increasing the antenna gain can be easily calculated using Equation
(4.114) and is graphically presented in Figure 8.7.
Gains of up to 17 dB can be reached quite easily by using a long Yagi–Uda antenna (Rotham-
mel, 2001). For an antenna gain of 17 dB, however, the boom would have to have a length that
corresponds to almost ten times the wavelength λ, i.e. 3.4 m for 868 MHz, 3.3 m for 915 MHz or

Security of RFID Systems
221
1.2 m for 2.45 GHz. However, in this way it is possible to reach seven to eight times the read
range as opposed to using a dipole antenna. According to the theory, the gain can increase by a
maximum of 3 dB for a doubling of antenna length and number of elements (Rothammel, 2001).
To reach an antenna gain of 20 dB and thus a tenfold read range requires at least one antenna
with double length, i.e. twenty times wavelength λ. For 868 MHz, this results in a boom length
of 7 m; which is rather difﬁcult to handle. In order to reach twenty times the read range, we need
an antenna gain of approximately 26 dB. This is only possible if several long Yagi–Uda antennas
are combined into an antenna group which would result in an antenna monster of several metres.
Attacks with long Yagi–Uda antennas have already occurred. In mid-2005, a successful attempt to
read a transponder from a distance of 21 m (69 ft) led to substantial repercussions in the specialist
press (Defcon, 2005; Cheung, 2005).
If the antenna gain has to be further increased in order to further extend the range, we have to
use parabolic mirrors. With a gain of 40 dB, a read range that is a hundred times larger can be
achieved. For 868 MHz, the required mirror diameter amounts to almost 15 m (5.1 m for 2.45 GHz).
Finally, a thousandfold read range requires a gain of 60 dB which would need a parabolic mirror
of 145 m (52 m for 2.45 GHz).
These calculations clearly illustrate what distances are feasible for an attack. The most favourable
combination appears to be a long Yagi–Uda antenna together with a moderately increased trans-
mission power of the reader. It would be reasonable to hit the intersection of both straight lines
in Figure 8.6. More than twenty times the range does currently not appear to be achievable using
reasonable efforts.

Denial-of-Service Attack Through Blocker Tags
Modern RFID readers can easily communicate with a larger number of transponders within the
interrogation ﬁeld. Here, the reader uses an anticollision algorithm for selecting an individual
transponder in order to communicate with this transponder. For some applications it is sufﬁcient to
determine the serial numbers of the transponders situated within the read range, as the corresponding
data is stored in a data base (e.g. product data for an EPC).
In practice, there are mainly two established anticollision algorithms, the binary search tree
algorithm and the slotted ALOHA procedure. For a more detailed description of blocker tags, see
Sections 7.2.4.2 and 7.2.4.3.
As described in Chapter 7, a binary search tree uses a recursive algorithm that chooses for each
collision occurring at a bit location of the received serial number a branch in the binary tree by
setting the corresponding bit in the subsequent iteration to ‘0’ or ‘1’. And exactly here, the blocker

tag attacks as it simulates a collision at each bit location of the serial number by simultaneously
sending ‘0’ and ‘1’ (compare Figure 7.20). The misled reader cannot but run through the entire
binary search tree (Juels, n.d.).
The blocker tag pretends to the attacked reader that there are 2k transponders within its inter-
rogation ﬁeld where k is the number of bits in the serial number. Prompting such a large number
of serial numbers literally blocks the affected reader. If a reader needs time t1 for determining a
speciﬁc serial number, running through the entire search tree requires time tg = t1 × 2n where n is
the number of bits of an individual serial number. Assuming that time t1 is 1 ms and length n of a
serial number in our system is 48-bit, the reader needs tg = 2.8 × 211 for running through the entire
search tree, or in years: 8925! It is obvious that it will not be possible for a reader to recognise any
genuine responder in its response ﬁeld; even more so as it is usually not possible to distinguish
between a genuine and feigned serial number. A blocker tag that blocks the entire search tree of a
reader (denial-of-service, DOS) also is called full blocker or universal blocker (Juels, n.d.).
Even the widely used slotted ALOHA procedure can be easily blocked by a blocker tag. For
this procedure, the anticollision command of a reader is followed by a previously deﬁned number
of slots during which the transponders located in the reader’s interrogation ﬁeld send their serial
numbers to the reader. Here, the transponders randomly choose the used slot. If two or more
transponders try to transmit their serial numbers during the same time slot, none of the serial
numbers can be correctly read due to the occurring collision. A slotted ALOHA procedure can be
easily interrupted if the blocker tag sends – for each available time slot – a serial number, or even
easier, an invalid data package (e.g. a data package with an intentionally wrong check sum). The
reader is then unable to detect any further transponder in the response ﬁeld.
It is not always desirable to completely block the search tree and thus the number range of an
RFID system. An EPC serial number, for instance, consists of an 8-bit header, 28-bit EPC manager
code (the organisation that issued the transponder), 24-bit object manager code (designation of the
object according to information from the previous EPC manager) and a 36-bit individual number.

8.1.2.3.4
Relay Attack
This is a special kind of attack where the attacker can almost deliberately extend the range between
reader and transponder by interposing a transmission device (relay). The attacker brieﬂy ‘borrows’
the transponder and uses the relay to simulate for the reader that the transponder itself is located
within the reader’s interrogation range. For this, the attacker does not even require physical access
to the transponder, but only has to be situated within the read range of the transponder. Usually,
the owner of the transponder does not notice the attack or only a long time after the attack, for
example, if the attacked transponder was used to carry out transactions that are subject to charges
(e.g. shopping or train tickets).
Relay attacks require two different components that are linked via radio communication (Kﬁr
and Wool, 2005; Hancke, 2005). Located close to the reader, there will be one component (ghost,
proxy) which is able to receive the reader’s signals and to generate a load modulation in order
to communicate to the reader and thus to simulate a transponder. The second component (leech,
mole) consists of a transmitter which is able to supply a transponder with the power required for
its operation as well as to demodulate a load modulation of the transponder and thus to simulate a
reader (Figure 8.11).
The simplest option is now to demodulate in the ghost the data received from the reader or
transponder and then to transmit the received data stream one-to-one via radio communication to
the leech, which ﬁnally sends the data stream to the transponder (Hancke, 2005). Vice versa, the
interrogation data sent by the transponder will be demodulated in the leech and the data stream
received will be sent one-to-one via radio communication to the ghost which, in turn, transmits
the data further to the reader using load modulation (Figure 8.12). The reader assumes that the
transponder really is situated within the interrogation range of the reader and that therefore a
complete transaction between transponder and reader can be carried out.
The runtimes for the transmission of the data stream between ghost and leech increase with
larger distances. Even though signals are transmitted at the speed of light, it will still take about
3 µs per kilometre in one direction. For a time-critical protocol, such as ISO/IEC 14442 Type A,
this may quickly turn into a problem. If the last bit of a request or anticollision command sent

An analogous relay system can be very easily realized by transmitting a demodulated data stream
between ghost and leech
by the reader is a ‘1’, the ﬁrst bit of the transponder’s response has to reach the reader at exactly
91.1 µs. The duration of one bit at the used bitrate of 106 kbit/s thus amounts to 9.43 µs. When
transmitting modulation signals over a distance of one kilometre, the reader’s command arrives
already with a delay of 3 µs. Transmitting the response from leech to ghost will add another 3 µs
delay, which means that the response of the transponder will arrive at the reader 6 µs later than

226
RFID Handbook
expected. This already corresponds to more than half the duration of a bit, and can result in that
the response will no longer be accepted by the reader.
The duration of time-outs for sending application commands exceeds the deviations tolerated by
ISO/IEC 14443 Type A for request and anticollision commands by multiples. On the other hand,
the protocol for the application data is completely transparent, i.e. the application data (INF/APDU)
are packaged in a protocol layer, but are never changed, as illustrated in Figure 9.28 for instance.
For this reason, it is possible to implement the complete protocol stack of a transponder in the
ghost. The ghost itself can then process time-critical commands, such as requests or anticollision
commands, without the need for any interaction with the leech or the transponder to be attacked.
Similarly, it is possible to build on the leech-side such a communication link to the transponder
without having to initially communicate with the ghost. If the ghost ﬁnally receives a data block,
only the application data contained therein (APDU) will be transmitted to the leech which, in turn,
will package them into a complete data block (Figure 9.28) and send them on to the transponder.
A similar process is used for the reverse transmission direction. The duration of time-out for
application commands usually amounts to some 10–100 ms, which means that transmission time
between ghost and leech are hardly important any longer. This way, attackers can bridge very large
distances. Even partial data transmission in the Internet is feasible.
Relay attacks using protocol stacks in ghost and leech are hard to discover due to the usually strict
separation of protocol and application data (APDU). It would require a procedure that suspends
this strict separation and, for instance, includes status information of the protocol layer into the
authentiﬁcation of transponder and reader (see Section 8.2.1) (Hancke and Kuhn, 2005).
8.2
Protection by Cryptographic Measures
RFID systems are increasingly being used in high-security applications, such as access systems
and systems for making payments or issuing tickets. However, the use of RFID systems in these
applications necessitates the use of security measures to protect against attempted attacks, in which
people try to trick the RFID system in order to gain unauthorised access to buildings or avail
themselves of services (tickets) without paying. For details regarding the technical possibilities see
Section 8.1.
For centuries myths and fairy tales have sought to ﬁnd examples of attempts to outsmart security
systems. For example, Ali Baba was able to gain access to the supposedly secure hideout of the
Forty Thieves by discovering the secret password. Modern authentication protocols also work by
checking knowledge of a secret (i.e. a cryptographic key). However, suitable algorithms can be
employed to prevent the secret key being cracked. High-security RFID systems must have a defence
against the following individual attacks:
• skimming of a data carrier in order to clone and/or modify data;
• placing a foreign data carrier within the interrogation zone of a reader with the intention of
gaining unauthorised access to a building or receiving services without payment;
• eavesdropping on radio communications and replaying the data, in order to imitate a genuine
data carrier (‘replay and fraud’).
When selecting a suitable RFID system, consideration should be given to cryptological functions.
Applications that do not require a security function (e.g. industrial automation, tool recognition)
would be made unnecessarily expensive by the incorporation of cryptological procedures. On the
other hand, in high-security applications (e.g. ticketing, payment systems) the omission of crypto-
logical procedures can be a very expensive oversight if manipulated transponders are used to gain
access to services without authorisation.

Mutual authentication between reader and transponder is based upon the principle of three-pass
mutual authentication in accordance with ISO/IEC 9798-2, in which both participants in the com-
munication check the other party’s knowledge of a secret cryptological key.
In this procedure, all the transponders and receivers that form part of an application are in
possession of the same secret cryptological key K (→symmetrical procedure). When a transponder
ﬁrst enters the interrogation zone of a reader it cannot be assumed that the two participants in the
communication belong to the same application. From the point of view of the reader, there is a
need to protect the application from manipulation using falsiﬁed data. Likewise, on the part of the
transponder there is a need to protect the stored data from skimming or overwriting.
The mutual authentication procedure begins with the reader sending a GET_CHALLENGE com-
mand to the transponder. A random number RA is then generated in the transponder and sent back
to the reader (response →challenge–response procedure). The reader now generates a random
number RB. Using the common secret key K and a common key algorithm ek, the reader cal-
culates an encrypted data block (token 1), which contains both random numbers and additional
control data, and sends this data block to the transponder.
Token1 = eK(RB||RA||IDA||Text1)
(8.1)
The received token 1 is decrypted in the transponder and the random number R′
A contained in
the plain text is compared with the previously transmitted RA. If the two ﬁgures correspond, then
the transponder has conﬁrmed that the two common keys correspond. Another random number RA2
is generated in the transponder and this is used to calculate an encrypted data block (token 2),
which also contains RB and control data. Token 2 is sent from the transponder to the reader.
Token2 = eK(RA2||RB||Text2)
(8.2)
The reader decrypts token 2 and checks whether RB, which was sent previously, corresponds
with R′
B, which has just been received. If the two ﬁgures correspond, then the reader is satisﬁed
that the common key has been proven. Transponder and reader have thus ascertained that they
belong to the same system and furthercommunication between the two parties is thus legitimised.
To sum up, the mutual authentication procedure has the following advantages:
• The secret keys are never transmitted over the airwaves, only encrypted random numbers are
transmitted.
• Two random numbers are always encrypted simultaneously. This rules out the possibility of
performing an inverse transformation using RA to obtain token 1, with the aim of calculating the
secret key.

228
RFID Handbook
• The token can be encrypted using any algorithm.
• The strict use of random numbers from two independent sources (transponder, reader) means
that recording an authentication sequence for playback at a later date (replay attack) would fail.
• A random key (session key) can be calculated from the random numbers generated, in order to
cryptologically secure the subsequent data transmission.
8.2.2
Authentication using Derived Keys
One disadvantage of the authentication procedure described in Section 8.1 is that all transponders
belonging to an application are secured using an identical cryptological key K. For applications that
involve vast quantities of transponders (e.g. the ticketing system for the public transport network,
which uses several million transponders) this represents a potential source of danger. Because such
transponders are accessible to everyone in uncontrolled numbers, the small probability that the key
for a transponder will be discovered must be taken into account. If this occurred, the procedure
described above would be totally open to manipulation.
A signiﬁcant improvement on the authentication procedure described can be achieved by secur-
ing each transponder with a different cryptological key. To achieve this, the serial number of each
transponder is read out during its production. A key KX is calculated (→derived) using a crypto-
logical algorithm and a master key KM, and the transponder is thus initialised. Each transponder
thus receives a key linked to its own ID number and the master key KM.
The mutual authentication begins by the reader requesting the ID number of the transponder. In a
special security module in the reader, the SAM (security authentication module), the transponder’s
speciﬁc key is calculated using the master key KM, so that this can be used to initiate the authen-
tication procedure. The SAM normally takes the form of a smart card with contacts incorporating
a cryptoprocessor, which means that the stored master key can never be read.
8.2.3
Encrypted Data Transfer
Chapter 7 described methods of dealing with interference caused by physical effects during data
transmission. Let us now extend this model to a potential attacker. We can differentiate between
two basic types of attack. Attacker 1 behaves passively and tries to eavesdrop on the transmission
to discover conﬁdential information for wrongful purposes. Attacker 2, on the other hand, behaves
actively to manipulate the transmitted data and alter it to his beneﬁt (see Figure 8.3).

The cipher data is transformed back to its original form in the receiver using the secret key K′
and the secret algorithm (→decryption, deciphering).
Cryptological procedures are used to protect against both passive and active attacks. To achieve
this, the transmitted data (plain text) can be altered (encrypted) prior to transmission so that a poten-
tial attacker can no longer draw conclusions about the actual content of the message (plain text).
Encrypted data transmission always takes place according to the same pattern. The transmission
data (plain text) is transformed into cipher data (cipher text) (→ncryption, ciphering) using a
secret key K and a cryptographical algorithm. Without knowing the encryption algorithm and the
secret key K a potential attacker is unable to interpret the recorded data. It is not possible to recreate
the transmission data from the cipher data.
If the keys K for ciphering and K′ for deciphering are identical (K = K′) or in a direct rela-
tionship to each other, the procedure is a symmetrical key procedure. If knowledge of the key K
is irrelevant to the deciphering process, the procedure is an asymmetrical key procedure. RFID

systems have for a long time used only symmetrical procedures, therefore we will not describe
other procedures in further detail here.
If each character is individually encrypted prior to transmission, the procedure is known as
sequential ciphering (or stream ciphering). If, on the other hand, several characters are incorporated
into a block then we talk of a block cipher. Because block ciphers are generally very calculation
intensive, they play a less important role in RFID systems. Therefore the emphasis is placed on
sequential ciphers in what follows.
A fundamental problem of all cryptological procedures is the secure distribution of the secret
key K, which must be known by the authorised communication participants prior to the start of
the data transfer procedure.
8.2.3.1
Stream Cipher
Sequential ciphers or stream ciphers are encryption algorithms in which the sequence of plain text
characters is encrypted sequentially using a different function for every step (Fumy, 1994). The
ideal realisation of a stream cipher is the so-called one-time pad, also known as the Vernam cipher
after its discoverer (Longo, 1993).
In this procedure a random key K is generated, for example using dice, prior to the transmission
of encrypted data, and this key is made available to both parties (Figure 8.17). The key sequence is
linked with the plain text sequence by the addition of characters or using XOR gating. The random
sequence used as a key must be at least as long as the message to be encrypted, because periodic
repetitions of a typically short key in relation to the plain text would permit cryptoanalysis and
thus an attack on the transmission. Furthermore, the key may only be used once, which means that
an extremely high level of security is required for the secure distribution of keys. Stream ciphering
in this form is completely impractical for RFID systems.

In the one-time pad, keys generated from random numbers (dice) are used only once and then

recipient

Security of RFID Systems
231
To overcome the problem of key generation and distribution, systems have been created based
upon the principle of the one-time pad stream cipher, that use a so-called pseudorandom sequence
instead of an actual random sequence. Pseudorandom sequences are generated using so-called
pseudorandom generators.
Figure 8.18 shows the fundamental principle of a sequential cipher using a pseudorandom gen-
erator: because the encryption function of a sequential cipher can change (at random) with every
character, the function must be dependent not only upon the current input character, but also upon
an additional feature, the internal state M. This internal state M is changed after every encryp-
tion step by the state transformation function g(K). The pseudorandom generator is made up of
the components M and g(K). The security of the cipher depends principally upon the number of
internal states M and the complexity of the transformation function g(K). The study of sequential
ciphers is thus primarily concerned with the analysis of pseudorandom generators.
The encryption function f (K) itself, on the other hand, is generally very simple and can only
comprise an addition or XOR logic gating (Fumy, 1994; Glogau, 1994).
From a circuitry point of view, pseudorandom generators are realised by state machines. These
consist of binary storage cells, so-called ﬂip-ﬂops. If a state machine has n storage cells then it
can take on 2n different internal M states. The state transformation function g(K) is represented
by combinatorial logic (a more detailed explanation of the functionality of state machines can be

found in Chapter 10). The implementation and development of pseudorandom generators can be
greatly simpliﬁed if we restrict ourselves to the use of linear feedback shift registers.
A shift register is realised by the serial connection of ﬂip-ﬂops (outputn is connected with
inputn+1) and the parallel connection of all timing inputs. The content of the ﬂip-ﬂop cell is shifted
forwards by one position with every timing pulse. The content of the last ﬂip-ﬂop is output (Golomb,
1982; Rueppel, 1986).

Standardisation
The development of standards is the responsibility of the technical committee of different standard-
ization institutes. The ISO (International Organisation for Standardization) is a worldwide union
of national standardisation institutions, such as DIN (Germany) and ANSI (USA) and contributes
with numerous committees and working groups to the development of RFID standards.
The description of standards in this chapter merely serves to aid our technical understanding
of the RFID applications dealt with in this book and no attempt has been made to describe the
standards mentioned in their entirety. Furthermore, standards are updated from time to time and are
thus subject to change. When working with the RFID applications in question the reader should not
rely on the parameters speciﬁed in this chapter. We recommend that copies of the original versions
in question are procured. The necessary addresses are listed in Section 14.2.
9.1
Animal Identiﬁcation
ISO standards 11784, 11785 and 14223 deal with the identiﬁcation of animals using RFID systems.
• ISO/IEC 11784: Radio-frequency identiﬁcation of animals – Code structure
• ISO/IEC 11785: Radio-frequency identiﬁcation of animals – Technical concept
• ISO/IEC 14223: Radio-frequency identiﬁcation of animals – Advanced transponders:
Part 1: Air interface
Part 2: Code and command structure
Part 3: Applications
The constructional form of the transponder used is not speciﬁed in the standards and therefore
the form can be designed to suit the animal in question. Small, sterile glass transponders that can
be injected into the fatty tissues of the animal are normally used for the identiﬁcation of cows,
horses and sheep. Ear tags or collars are also possible.
9.1.1
ISO/IEC 11784 – Code Structure
The identiﬁcation code for animals comprises a total of 64 bits (8 bytes). Table 9.1 shows the
signiﬁcance of the individual bits. The national identiﬁcation code should be managed by the
individual countries. Bits 27 to 64 may also be allocated to differentiate between different animal
types, breeds, regions within the country, breeders, etc., but this is not speciﬁed in this standard.

ISO/IEC 11785 – Technical Concept
This standard deﬁnes the transmission method for the transponder data and the reader speciﬁcations
for activating the data carrier (transponder). A central aim in the development of this standard was
to facilitate the interrogation of transponders from an extremely wide range of manufacturers using
a common reader. A reader for animal identiﬁcation in compliance with the standard recognises
and differentiates between transponders that use a full/half-duplex system (load modulation) and
transponders that use a sequential system.
9.1.2.1
Requirements
The standard speciﬁes the operating frequency for the reader as 134.2 ± 1.8 kHz. The emitted ﬁeld
provides a power supply for the transponder and is therefore termed the ‘activation ﬁeld’.
The activation ﬁeld is periodically switched on for 50 ms at a time and then switched off for
3 ms (1 in Figure 9.1). During the 50 ms period when it is switched on it waits for the response
from a full/half-duplex transponder – a sequential transponder in the ﬁeld requires the activation
ﬁeld to charge up its charging capacitor.
If a full/half-duplex transponder is present within the range of the activation ﬁeld, then this
transponder sends its data during the operating interval of the ﬁeld (2 in Figure 9.1). While data is
being received the operating interval can be extended to 100 ms if the data transfer is not completed
within the ﬁrst 50 ms.
A sequential transponder in the range of the activation ﬁeld (3 in Figure 9.1) begins to transmit
data within the 3 ms pause. The duration of the pause is extended to a maximum of 20 ms to permit
the complete transmission of a data record.

Standardisation
235
If portable or stationary readers are operated in the vicinity of one another, then there is a high
probability that a reader will emit its activation ﬁeld during the 3 ms pause of the other reader.
This would result in neither of the readers being able to receive the data signal of a sequential
transponder. Due to the relatively strong activation ﬁeld in comparison to the ﬁeld strength of a
sequential transponder this effect occurs in a multiple of the reader’s normal read radius. Appendix
C of the standard therefore describes procedures for the synchronisation of several readers to
circumvent this problem.
Portable and stationary readers can be tested for the presence of a second reader (B in Figure 9.2)
in the vicinity by extending the pause duration to 30 ms. If the activation ﬁeld of a second reader
(B) is received within the 30 ms pause, then the standard stipulates that the activation ﬁeld of the
reader (A) should be switched on for a maximum of 50 ms as soon as the previously detected reader
(B) switches its activation ﬁeld on again after the next 3 ms pause. In this manner, a degree of
synchronisation can be achieved between two neighbouring readers. Because data is only transmitted
from the transponder to the reader (and the activation ﬁeld thus always represents an unmodulated
RF ﬁeld), an individual transponder can be read by two portable readers simultaneously. To maintain
the stability of the synchronisation, every tenth pause cycle is extended from 3 to 30 ms to detect
any other readers that have recently entered the area.
Stationary readers also use a synchronisation cable connected to all readers in the system. The
synchronisation signal at this cable is a simple logic signal with low and high levels. The resting
state of the cable is a logic low level.
If one of the connected readers detects a transponder, then the synchronisation cable switches to
the high level while data is transmitted from the transponder to the reader. All other readers extend
their current phase (activation/pause).
If the detected data carrier is a full/half-duplex transponder, then the synchronised readers are in
the ‘activation ﬁeld’ phase. The activation period of the activation ﬁeld is now extended until the
synchronisation cable is once again switched to low level (but with a maximum of 100 ms).
If the signal of a sequential transponder is received, the synchronised readers are in the ‘pause’
phase. The synchronisation signal at the cable extends the pause duration of all readers to 20 ms
(ﬁxed value).

Full/Half-Duplex System

a subcarrier is used, whereby the data is represented in a differential bi-phase code (DBP). The
bit rate is derived by dividing the reader frequency by 32. At 134.2 kHz the transmission speed
(bitrate) is 4194 bit/s.
A full/half-duplex data telegram comprises an 11-bit header, 64 bits (8 bytes) of useful data, 16-
bit (2-byte) CRC and 24-bit (3-byte) trailer (Figure 9.3). After every eight transmitted bits a stufﬁng
bit with a logic 1 level is inserted to avoid the chance occurrence of the header 00000000001. The
transmission of the total of 128 bits takes around 30.5 ms at the given transmission speed.
9.1.2.3
Sequential System
After every 50 ms the activation ﬁeld is switched off for 3 ms. A sequential transponder that
has previously been charged with energy from the activation ﬁeld begins to transmit the stored
identiﬁcation data approximately 1–2 ms after the activation ﬁeld has been switched off.
The modulation method used by the transponder is frequency shift keying (2 FSK). The bit
coding uses NRZ (comparable to RS232 on a PC). A logic 0 corresponds to the basic frequency
134.2 kHz; a logic 1 corresponds to the frequency 124.2 kHz.
The bitrate is derived by dividing the transmission frequency by 16. The bitrate varies between
8387 bit/s for a logic 0 and 7762 bit/s for a logic 1, depending upon the frequency shift keying.
The sequential data telegram comprises an 8-bit header 01111110b, 64 bits (8 bytes) of useful
data, 16-bit (2-byte) CRC and 24-bit (3-byte) trailer. Stufﬁng bits are not inserted.
The transmission of the total of 112 bits takes a maximum of 14.5 ms at the given transmission
speed (‘1’ sequence).
9.1.3
ISO/IEC 14223 – Advanced Transponders
This standard deﬁnes the RF interface and the data structure of so-called advanced transponders.
ISO/IEC 14223 is based upon the older standards ISO/IEC 11784 and ISO/IEC 11785 and represents
a further development of these standards. Whereas transponders in accordance with ISO/IEC 11785
only transmit a permanently programmed identiﬁcation code, in advanced transponders there is the
possibility of managing a larger memory area. As a result, data can be read, written and even
protected against overwriting (lock memory block), in blocks.
The standard consists of three parts: Part 1: ‘Air Interface’, Part 2 ‘Code and Command Structure’
and Part 3 ‘Applications’. Since this standard is currently still in development we can only consider
the content of Parts 1 and 2 here. Part 2 of the standard is based heavily upon the standard ISO/IEC
18000-2, which is still in development.
9.1.3.1
Part 1 – Air Interface
As a further development of ISO/IEC 11785, ISO/IEC 14223 is downwards compatible with its
predecessor standard and can thus only be considered in connection with ISO/IEC 11785. This

Standardisation
237
means both that the identiﬁcation number of each advanced transponder can be read by a simple
ISO/IEC 11785 reader and that an ISO/IEC 11785 transponder is accepted by any advanced reader.
If an advanced transponder enters the interrogation ﬁeld of an ISO/IEC 14223 compatible reader,
then ﬁrst of all the ISO/IEC 11784 identiﬁcation code will always be read in accordance with the
procedure in ISO/IEC 11785. To facilitate differentiation between an advanced transponder and a
pure ISO/IEC 11785 transponder, bit 16 (data block follows) of the identiﬁcation code is set to ‘1’
in advanced transponders. Then, by means of a deﬁned procedure, the transponder is switched into
advanced mode, in which commands can also be sent to the transponder.
Advanced transponders can be subdivided into full-duplex (FDX-B) and sequential (HDX-ADV)
transponders.
The procedures and parameters deﬁned in ISO/IEC 11785 apply to the data transmission from
transponder to reader (up = link) in any operating state.
9.1.3.1.1
FDX-B
If an advanced transponder of type FDX-B enters the interrogation ﬁeld of a reader, then the
transponder’s identiﬁcation code, as deﬁned in ISO/IEC 11785, is continuously transmitted to the
reader. The reader recognises that this is an FDX-B transponder by the setting of bit 16 (data
block follows). In order to switch the transponder into advanced mode the ﬁeld of the reader must
ﬁrst be completely switched off for 5 ms. If the ﬁeld is switched back on, the transponder can
be switched into advanced mode within a deﬁned time window by the transmission of a 5-bit
‘SWITCH’ command. The transponder then awaits further commands from the reader.

9.1.3.1.2
HDX-ADV
A sequential transponder (HDX) charges its charging capacitor during the 50 ms period that the
ﬁeld is switched on. Within the 3 ms ﬁeld pause the transponder begins to transmit the 64-bit
identiﬁcation code, as deﬁned in ISO/IEC 11785. The duration of the pause is extended to a
maximum of 20 ms to facilitate the complete transfer of the data block. An advanced transponder
(HDX-ADV) is recognised by the setting of bit 16 (data block follows) in the identiﬁcation code.
A sequential transponder can be switched to any interrogation cycle in advanced mode. To achieve
this, a command is simply sent to the transponder in the second half of the 50 ms period in which
the ﬁeld is switched on (Figure 9.5). The transponder executes this command immediately and
sends its response to the reader in the next pause. If no command is sent in an interrogation cycle,
then the transponder automatically reverts to ISO/IEC 11785 mode and transmits its identiﬁcation
code to the reader in the next pause.
9.1.3.2
Part 2 – Code and Command Structure
This part of the standard describes the simple transmission protocol between transponder and reader,
the memory organisation of the transponder, and commands that must be supported by advanced
transponders.
The structure of a command frame is identical for all types of transponder and is shown in
Figure 9.6. The 5-bit command ﬁeld allows 32 different commands to be deﬁned. Command codes
00–19 are already deﬁned in the standard and are supported in the same way by all advanced
transponders. Command codes 20–31, on the other hand, are freely deﬁnable by the chip manufac-
turer and can therefore be occupied by commands with an extremely wide range of functions. The
parameters contain (in the case of read and write commands) the block address of a memory block,

The structure of the response frame is shown in Figure 9.7. This contains a ﬂag that signals the
error status of the transponder to the reader (error ﬂag). The subsequent 3-bit status ﬁeld contains
a more precise interpretation of the error that has occurred.

Contactless Smart Cards
There are currently three different standards for contactless smart cards based upon a broad classi-
ﬁcation of the range (Table 9.4).1
Most of the standard for close-coupling smart cards – ISO 10536 – had already been developed
by between 1992 and 1995. Due to the high manufacturing costs of this type of card2 and the small

advantages in comparison to contact smart cards,3 close-coupling systems were never successful
on the market and today they are hardly ever used.
9.2.1
ISO/IEC 10536 – Close-Coupling Smart Cards
The ISO/IEC standard 10536 entitled ‘Identiﬁcation cards – contactless integrated circuit(s) cards’
describes the structure and operating parameters of contactless close-coupling smart cards. ISO/IEC
10536 consists of the following four sections:
• Part 1: Physical characteristics
• Part 2: Dimensions and location of coupling areas
• Part 3: Electronic signals and reset procedures
• Part 4: Answer to reset and transmission protocols (still under preparation)
9.2.1.1
Part 1 – Physical Characteristics
The physical characteristics of close-coupling cards are deﬁned in Part 1 of the standard. The
speciﬁcations regarding mechanical dimensions are identical to those for contact smart cards.
9.2.1.2
Part 2 – Dimensions and Locations of Coupling Areas
Part 2 of the standard speciﬁes the position and dimensions of the coupling elements. Both inductive
(H1–H4) and capacitive coupling elements (E1–E4) are used. The arrangement of the coupling
elements is selected so that a close-coupling card can be operated in an insertion reader in all four
positions (Figure 9.9).
9.2.1.3
Part 3 – Electronic Signals and Reset Procedures
9.2.1.3.1
Power Supply
The power supply for close-coupling cards is derived from the four inductive coupling elements
H1–H4. The inductive alternating ﬁeld should have a frequency of 4.9152 MHz. The coupling

elements H1 and H2 are designed as coils, but have opposing directions of winding, so that if
power is supplied to the coupling elements at the same time there must be a phase difference of
180◦between the associated magnetic ﬁelds F1 and F2 (e.g. through a U-shaped core in the reader).
The same applies for the coupling elements H3 and H4.
The readers must be designed such that power of 150 mW can be provided to the contactless
card from any of the magnetic ﬁelds F1–F4. However, the card may not draw more than 200 mW
via all four ﬁelds together.
9.2.1.3.2
Data Transmission Card →Reader
Either inductive or capacitive coupling elements may be used for data transmission between card
and reader. However, it is not possible to switch between the two types of coupling during com-
munication.
Inductive. Load modulation with a subcarrier is used for the transmission of data via the coupling
ﬁelds H1–H4. The subcarrier frequency is 307.2 kHz and the subcarrier is modulated using 180◦
PSK. The reader is designed such that a load change of 10% of the base load at one or more
of the ﬁelds F1–F4 can be recognised as a load modulation signal. The speciﬁed minimum load
change for a card is 1 mW.
Capacitive.
In this procedure the coupling ﬁelds E1, E2 or E3, E4 are used as pairs. In both
cases the paired coupling ﬁelds are controlled by a differential signal. The voltage difference
Udiff = UE1 – UE2 should be measured such that a voltage level of at least 0.33 V is present at
the reader coupling surfaces E1′ and E2′. Data transmission takes place using NRZ coding in the
baseband (i.e. no subcarrier). The data rate after reset is 9600 bit/s; however, a higher data rate
can be used during operation.
9.2.1.3.3
Data Transmission Reader →Card
The standard gives preference to the inductive method for data transmission to the card. The
modulation procedure is a 90◦PSK of the ﬁelds F1–F4 and the phase position of all ﬁelds is
modulated synchronously. Depending upon the position of the card in the insertion reader, the
phase relationships shown in Tables 9.5 and 9.6 are possible between the coupling ﬁelds during
modulation.
Data transmission takes place using NRZ coding in the baseband (i.e. no subcarrier). The data
rate after reset is 9600 bit/s; however, a higher data rate can be used during operation.

Part 4 – Answer to Reset and Transmission Protocols
This part of ISO 10536 describes the transmission protocol between reader and card. We will not
describe Part 4 here because it is still under development by the standardisation committee in
question, and may therefore be subject to change.
9.2.2
ISO/IEC 14443 – Proximity-Coupling Smart Cards
ISO/IEC standard 14443 entitled ‘Identiﬁcation cards – Proximity integrated circuit(s) cards’
describes the operating method and operating parameters of contactless proximity-coupling smart
cards. This means contactless smart cards with an approximate range of 7–15 cm, like those
used predominantly in the ﬁeld of ticketing. The data carrier of these smart cards is normally a
microprocessor and they often have additional contacts (see also Section 10.2.1).
The standard comprises the following parts:
• Part 1: Physical characteristics.
• Part 2: Radio frequency power and signal interface.
• Part 3: Initialisation and anticollision (still in preparation).
• Part 4: Transmission protocols (in preparation).
9.2.2.1
Part 1 – Physical Characteristics
Part 1 of the standard deﬁnes the mechanical properties of the smart cards. The dimensions corre-
spond with the values speciﬁed in ISO/IEC 7810, i.e. 85.72 × 54.03 × 0.76 mm ± tolerances.
Furthermore, this part of the standard also includes notes on the testing of the dynamic bending
stress and dynamic torsion stress, plus irradiation with UV, X-ray and electromagnetic radiation.
9.2.2.2
Part 2 – Radio Frequency Interference
The power supply of inductively coupled proximity cards (PICC) is provided by the magnetic
alternating ﬁeld of a reader (PCD) at a transmission frequency of 13.56 MHz. To this end the card
incorporates a large area antenna coil typically with 3–6 windings of wire (see Figures 2.11 and
2.12).
The magnetic ﬁeld generated by the reader must be within the range 1.5 A/m ≤H ≤7.5 A/m.
Thus the interrogation ﬁeld strength Hmin of a proximity-coupling smart card is automatically
Hmin ≤1.5 A/m. This is the only way to ensure that a smart card with an interrogation ﬁeld
strength Hmin = 1.5 A/m can be read by a reader that generates a ﬁeld strength of just 1.5 A/m
(e.g. a portable, battery-operated reader with a correspondingly lower transmission power), at least
at distance x = 0 from the transmission antenna (smart card in contact) (Berger, 1998).
If the ﬁeld strength curve of a reader and the interrogation ﬁeld strength of a proximity-coupling
smart card are known, then the range of the system can be calculated. The ﬁeld strength curve of
a typical reader in accordance with ISO/IEC 14443 is shown in Figure 9.11 (see Section 4.1.1.1).
In this case, a smart card interrogation ﬁeld strength of 1.5 A/m results in a range of 10 cm.
Unfortunately it was not possible to agree to a common communication interface in the devel-
opment of this standard. For this reason, two completely different procedures for the data transfer
between reader and proximity-coupling smart card have found a place in ISO/IEC 14443 – Type A
and Type B. A smart card only has to support one of the two communication procedures. A reader
conforming to the standard, on the other hand, must be able to communicate equally well by both
procedures, and thus support all smart cards. This means that the reader must switch between the
two communication procedures (polling) periodically during ‘idle’ mode (‘wait for smart card’).

However, the reader may not switch between the two procedures during an existing communication
relationship between reader and card.
9.2.2.2.1
Communication Interface – Type A
In type A cards 100% ASK modulation with modiﬁed Miller coding (Figure 9.12) is deﬁned as
the modulation procedure used for the transfer of data from reader to card. In order to guarantee
a continuous power supply to the card the length of the blanking intervals is just 2–3 µs. The
requirements of the transient response and transient characteristics of the RF signal generated
by the reader in the blanking intervals are described in detail in the standard. A load modulation
procedure with subcarrier is used for data transfer from the smart card to the reader. The subcarrier
frequency fH = 847 kHz (13.56 MHz/16). The modulation of the subcarrier is performed by on/off
keying of the subcarrier using a Manchester coded data stream.
In both transfer directions the baud rate fBd = 106 kBit/s (13.56 MHz/128).
9.2.2.2.2
Communication Interface – Type B
In Type B cards 10% ASK modulation (Figure 9.14) is used as the modulation procedure for the data
transfer from reader to card. A simple NRZ coding is used for bit coding. The transient response
and transient characteristics of the RF signal in the 0/1 transitions are precisely deﬁned in the
standard and requirements of the quality of the transmission antenna can be derived from this (see
Section 11.4.3).
For data transfer from the smart card to the reader load modulation with a subcarrier is also used
for the Type B card. The subcarrier frequency fH = 847 kHz (13.56 MHz/16). The subcarrier is
modulated by 180◦phase shift keying (BPSK) of the subcarrier using the NRZ coded data stream.
In both transmission directions the baud rate fBd = 106 kBit/s (13.56 MHz/128).

Overview
To sum up, the parameters shown in Tables 9.7 and 9.8 exist for the physical interface between
reader and smart card of an RFID system in accordance with ISO/IEC 14443-2.
9.2.2.3
Part 3 – Initialisation and Anticollision
If a proximity-coupling smart card enters the interrogation ﬁeld of a reader, then a communication
relationship must ﬁrst of all be built up between reader and smart card, taking into consideration
the fact that there may be more than one smart card within the interrogation zone of this reader
and that the reader may already be in communication with another card. This part of the standard
therefore ﬁrst describes the structure of the protocol frames from the basic elements deﬁned in Part
2 – data bit, start-of-frame and end-of-frame marks – and the anticollision procedure used for the
selection of an individual card. Since the different modulation procedure for Type A and Type B
also requires a different frame structure and anticollision procedure, the divide between the two
types A and B is reﬂected in Part 3 of the standard.
9.2.2.3.1
Type A Card
As soon as a Type A smart card enters the interrogation zone of a reader and sufﬁcient supply
voltage is available, the card’s microprocessor begins to operate. After the performance of some
initialisation routines – if the card is a dual interface card these include checking whether the card
is in contactless or contact mode – the card is put into so-called IDLE mode. At this point the
reader can exchange data with another smart card in the interrogation zone. However, smart cards
in the IDLE state may never react to the reader’s data transmission to another smart card (‘any
command’) so that an existing communication is not interrupted.

modulation with BPSK modulated subcarrier
If, when the card is in IDLE mode, it receives a valid REQA command (Request-A), then an
ATQA block (answer to request) is sent back to the reader in response (Figure 9.16). In order
to ensure that data destined for another card in the interrogation ﬁeld of the reader is not falsely
interpreted as a REQA command, this command is made up of only 7 data bits (Figure 9.17). The
ATQA block sent back, on the other hand, consists of 2 bytes and is returned in a standard frame.
After the card has responded to the REQA command it is put into the READY state. The reader
has now recognised that at least one card is in the interrogation ﬁeld and begins the anticollision
algorithm by transmitting a SELECT command. The anticollision procedure used here is a dynamic
binary search tree algorithm.4 A bit-oriented frame is used for the transfer of the search criterion
and the card’s response, so that the transmission direction between reader and card can be reversed
after a desired number of bits have been sent. The NVB (number of valid bits) parameter of the
SELECT command speciﬁes the current length of the search criterion.
The length of a single serial number is 4 bytes. If a serial number is detected by the anticollision
algorithm, then the reader ﬁnally sends the full serial number (NVB = 40 h) in the SELECT
command, in order to select the card in question. The card with the detected serial number conﬁrms
this command by an SAK (SELECT-Acknowledge) and is thereby put into ACTIVE state, the
selected state. A peculiarity, however, is that not all cards possess a 4-byte serial number (single
size). The standard also permits serial numbers of 7 bytes (double size) and even 10 bytes (triple

A dynamic binary search tree algorithm is used for the determination of the serial number of a
card. The serial numbers can be 4, 7 or 10 bytes long, so the algorithm has to be run several times at different
cascade levels (CL)
size). If the selected card has a double or triple size serial number, this will be signalled to the
reader in the card’s SAK, by a set cascade bit (b3 = 1), with the card remaining in the READY
state. This results in the anticollision algorithm being restarted in the reader so that it can detect the
second part of the serial number. In a triple size serial number the anticollision algorithm must even
be run a third time. To signal to the card which part of the serial number is to be detected by the
algorithm that has been initiated, the SELECT command differentiates between three cascade levels
(CL1, CL2, CL3) (Figure 9.19). However, the process of detecting a serial number always begins
with cascade level 1. In order to rule out the possibility of fragments of a longer serial number
corresponding by coincidence with a shorter serial number, so-called cascade tags (CT = 88 h) are
inserted at a predetermined position in the double or triple size numbers. This value may therefore
never occur at the corresponding byte positions in the shorter serial numbers.
Precise timing between a reader’s command and the smart card’s response should also be ensured.
The standard prescribes a synchronous behaviour of the smart card, which means that the response
may only be transmitted at deﬁned moments in a ﬁxed time grid (Table 9.9).

For the response to a REQA, WakeUp or SELECT command N = 9. For all other commands
(e.g. application commands) N must be greater than or equal to 9 (N = 9, 10, 11, 12, . . .).
9.2.2.3.2
Type B Cards
If a Type B smart card is brought within the interrogation ﬁeld of a reader, the smart card, after the
performance of a few initialisation routines, is initially put into IDLE mode and waits to receive a
valid REQB (REQUEST-B) command (Figure 9.20).
The transmission of a REQB command immediately initiates the anticollision algorithm in Type
B cards. The procedure used here is a dynamic slotted ALOHA procedure,5 in which the number of
slots can be dynamically changed by the reader. The number of slots currently available is encoded
in a parameter of the REQB command. In order to facilitate a preselection during the selection of
a card, the REQB command has a further parameter, the application family identiﬁer (AFI), which
allows a certain application group to be entered as a search criterion (Table 9.10).
After a card has received a valid REQB command it checks whether the application group
preselected in the parameter AFI is present in the applications stored on the card. If so, the parameter
M of the REQB command is evaluated to detect the number of slots available for anticollision
(Table 9.11). If the number of available slots is greater than one, a random-check generator in the
card is used to determine the number of the slot in which the card wishes to transmit its response
to the reader. In order to guarantee the synchronisation of the cards with the slots, the reader
transmits its own slot marker at the beginning of each slot. The card waits until the slot marker
of the previously determined slot is received (Ready Requested State) and responds to the REQB
command by sending an ATQB (Answer To Request B).
A short time after the transmission of a slot marker (Figure 9.23) the reader can determine
whether a smart card has begun to transmit an ATQB within the current slot. If not, the current
slot can simply be interrupted by the transmission of the next slot marker in order to save time.
The request response ATQB sent by the smart card provides the reader with a range of information
about important parameters of the smart card (see Figure 9.22). In order to be able to select the card,
the ATQB ﬁrst of all contains a 4-byte serial number. In contrast to Type A cards, the serial number
of a Type B card is not necessarily permanently linked to the microchip, but may even consist of
a random number, which is newly determined after every power-on reset (PUPI, pseudo unique

PICC identiﬁer). Parameters of the contactless interface are encoded within the ‘Protocol Info’
parameter, for example the maximum possible baud rate of the smart card, the maximum frame
size,6 or information on alternative protocols. The ‘Application Data’ parameter can, moreover,
include information on several applications available on the card (multi-application card).
As soon as the reader has received the ATQB of at least one smart card without errors the card
can be selected. This takes place by means of the ﬁrst application command transmitted by the
reader. The structure of this command corresponds with that of a standard frame (Figure 9.24), but
it is extended by additional information in a special preﬁx, the ATTRIB preﬁx (Figure 9.25).
The ATTRIB preﬁx itself is made up of the (previously determined) serial number (PUPI) of the
card to be selected and a parameter byte. The parameter byte contains important information on the
possible communication parameters of the reader, such as the smart card’s minimum waiting time
between a reader’s command and the smart card’s response, or the necessary waiting time between
the switching on of the subcarrier system in the load modulator and the ﬁrst data bit sent by the card.
6 The maximum frame size that a card can process is determined by the size of the available reception buffer in
the RAM memory of the microprocessor. Particularly in low-cost applications, the size of the RAM memory can
be very skimpily dimensioned.

Part 4 – Transmission Protocols
After a communication relationship has been established between a reader and a proximity-coupling
smart card, commands for reading, writing and the processing of data can be sent to the card.
This part of the standard describes the structure of the data protocol that this necessitates and
the processing of transmission errors, so that data can be transferred between the communication
participants without errors.
In the Type A card, additional information for the conﬁguration of the protocol to different
card and reader properties (e.g. possible baud rates, maximum size of the data blocks, etc.) must
be transferred. In Type B cards this information has already been transferred during the anticolli-
sion process (ATQB, ATTRIB), so in the case of this card type, the protocol can be commenced
immediately.

255
9.2.2.4.1
Protocol Activation in Type A Cards
The selection of a Type A card in the anticollision loop is conﬁrmed by the card by the transmis-
sion of a SAK (select acknowledge). The SAK contains information about whether a protocol in
accordance with ISO/IEC 14443-4 has been implemented in this card, or whether the card has a
proprietary protocol (e.g. MIFARE).
If a protocol in accordance with ISO/IEC 14443-4 is available in the card, the reader demands
the card’s ATS (answer to select) by transmitting a RATS command (request for answer to select,
Figure 9.26). The RATS command contains two parameters that are important for the subsequent
communication: FSDI and CID.
FSDI (frame size device integer) deﬁnes the maximum number of bytes that may be sent from
the card to the reader in one block. Possible values for this are 16, 24, 32, . . . 128 and 256 bytes.
Furthermore, the smart card is allocated a CID (card identiﬁer). Using the CID, it is possible for
a reader to maintain several Type A cards in a selected state at the same time and to address an
individual card selectively via its CID.
The ATS (answer to select) sent by the card in response to the RATS command corresponds to
the function of the ATR (answer to reset) of a contact smart card and describes important protocol
parameters of the smart card’s operating system, so that the data transmission between card and
reader can be optimised in relation to the properties of the implemented application.

Individually, the (optional) parameters listed in Table 9.12 can be contained in the ATS.
Immediately after receiving the ATS, the reader can still initiate the changeover of the transmis-
sion baud rates by sending out a special PPS command (protocol parameter selection). Based upon
an initial baud rate of 106 Kbit/s, the baud rates in both transmission directions can be increased
independently of one another by a factor of 2, 4 or 8 if the smart card has signalled the support of
higher baud rates in the optional parameters DS and DR in the ATS.
9.2.2.4.2
Protocol
The protocol described in ISO/IEC 14443-4 supports the transmission of application data (APDU
= application data unit) between the reader and the smart card. The transmitted APDU can contain
any desired data, such as command and response. The structure of this protocol is based heavily
upon the protocol T = 1 (ISO/IEC 7816-3) that we know from contact smart cards, in order to
keep the integration of this protocol into smart card operating systems that are already available,
in particular dual interface smart cards, as simple as possible. The protocol deﬁned in ISO/IEC
14443-4 is therefore often called T = CL.
The entire data transmission to an ISO/IEC 14443 card can also be represented in accordance
with the OSI layer model, as Figure 9.27 shows. In this model, every layer independently takes on
speciﬁc tasks and is thus transparent to the level above it. Layer 1, the physical layer, describes
the transmission medium and the coding of the data at byte level. ISO/IEC 14443-2 provides two
equivalent procedures here, Type A and Type B. Layer 2, the transport layer, controls the transmis-
sion of data between reader and smart card. Layer 2 automatically looks after the correct addressing
of the data blocks (CID), the sequential transmission of excessively sized data blocks (chaining),
the monitoring of the time procedure (FWT, WTX), and the handling of transmission errors. Layer
7, the application layer, contains the application data, i.e. the command to the smart card or the
response to a command. In contactless smart cards the data structures used in the application layer
are generally fully identical to those used in contact smart cards. This procedure is very worthwhile
for dual interface smart cards in particular, because it means that the application layer is indepen-
dent of the communications interface that is currently being used (contact, contactless). Layers 3–6

Figure 9.27
The ISO/OSI layer model in a smart card
are used in complex networks for the determination and forwarding of data packets. In smart cards
these layers of the OSI layer model are not used.
After the smart card has been activated (e.g. Type A after the transmission of the ATS and
possibly a PPS) it waits for the ﬁrst command from the reader. The sequence that now follows
always corresponds with the master–slave principle, with the reader as master and the card as slave.
The reader always sends a command to the smart card ﬁrst, which executes the command and sends
a response back to the reader. This pattern may never be broken; a smart card thus cannot initiate
any communication with the reader.
The basic structure of a data block (frame) from the transport layer is shown in Figure 9.28. We
differentiate between three types of blocks according to the method of functioning:
• I block (information block): Transmission of data from the application layer (APDU)
• R block (recovery block): Handling of transmission errors
• S block (supervisory block): Higher control of the protocol
The blocks are differentiated by different coding of the PCB (protocol control byte), as shown
in Figure 9.29.
The optional CID (card identiﬁer) is used for addressing an individual smart card in the interro-
gation zone of the reader. Thus, several smart cards can be activated at the same time and addressed
selectively using their CID. The NAD byte (node address) was introduced in order to ensure com-
patibility between ISO/IEC 14443-5 and ISO/IEC 7816-3 (T = 1). The use of this byte is therefore
not further deﬁned in ISO/IEC 14443.
In the case of an I block, the information ﬁeld (INF) serves as a container for the data of the
application layer (APDU). The content is transmitted entirely transparently. This means that the
content of the protocol is forwarded directly without analysis or evaluation.
Finally, a 16-bit CRC is appended as an EDC (error detection code) for error control.

ISO/IEC 15693 – Vicinity-Coupling Smart Cards
The ISO/IEC standard 15693 entitled ‘Identiﬁcation cards – contactless integrated circuit(s)
cards – Vicinity Cards’ describes the method of functioning and operating parameters of contactless
vicinity-coupling smart cards. These are smart cards with a range of up to 1 m, like those used
in access control systems. The data carriers used in these smart cards are predominantly cheap
memory modules with simple state machines (see Section 10.1.2.1).
The standard is made up of the following parts:
• Part 1: Physical characteristics
• Part 2: Air interface and initialization
• Part 3: Anti-collision and transmission protocol
9.2.3.1
Part 1 – Physical Characteristics
Part 1 of the standard deﬁnes the mechanical properties of proximity-coupling smart cards. The
dimensions of the smart card correspond with those speciﬁed in ISO/IEC 7810, i.e. 85.72 × 54.03 ×
0.76 mm ± tolerances.
Furthermore, this part of the standard includes additional notes for the testing of the dynamic
bending stress and the dynamic torsion stress, plus irradiation with UV, X-ray and electromagnetic
radiation.

Standardisation
259
9.2.3.2
Part 2 – Air Interface and Initialization
The power supply of the inductively coupled vicinity card (VICC) is provided by the magnetic
alternating ﬁeld of a reader (PCD) at a transmission frequency of 13.56 MHz. The vicinity card
incorporates a large area antenna coil for this purpose, typically with 3–6 windings of wire (see
Figures 2.11 and 2.12).
The magnetic ﬁeld to be generated by the reader must lie within the limit values 115 mA/m ≤
H ≤7.5 A/m. Thus, it is automatically the case for the interrogation ﬁeld strength Hmin of a
proximity-coupling smart card that Hmin ≤115 mA/m.
9.2.3.2.1
Data Transfer Reader →Card
Both 10% ASK and 100% ASK modulation are used for the data transfer from a reader to a vicinity
smart card (see Section 6.2.1). Regardless of the selected modulation index, moreover, one of two
different coding procedures can be selected: a ‘1 of 256’ code or a ‘1 of 4’ code.
A vicinity smart card must, in principle, support both modulation and coding procedures. How-
ever, not all combinations are equally practical. For example, 10% ASK modulation in combination
with ‘1 of 256’ coding should be given preference in ‘long-distance mode’. The lower ﬁeld strength
of the modulation sidebands in comparison to the ﬁeld strength of the (13.56 MHz) carrier signal
in this combination permits the full exploitation of the permissible magnetic ﬁeld strength for the
power supply of the card (see FCC 15 Part 3: the permissible magnetic ﬁeld strength of the modu-
lation side bands lies 50 dB below the maximum ﬁeld strength of the carrier signal of 42 dBµA/m
here). By contrast, 100% ASK modulation in combination with ‘1 of 4’ coding in readers can be
used with reduced range or even shielded readers (‘tunnel’ readers on conveyor belts).
9.2.3.2.2
‘1 of 256’ Coding
This coding procedure is a pulse position modulation (PPM ) procedure. This means that the value
of the digit to be transferred is unambiguously deﬁned in the value range 0–255 by the time position
of a modulation pulse (Figure 9.30). Therefore, 8 bits (1 byte) can be transferred at the same time
in one step. The total transmission time for a byte is 4.833 ms. This corresponds with 512 time
slots of 9.44 µs. A modulation pulse can only take place at an uneven time slot (counting begins

The ‘1 of 256’ coding is generated by the combination of 512 time slots of 9.44 µs length. The
value of the digit to be transferred in the value range 0–255 can be determined from the position in time of a
modulation pulse. A modulation pulse can only occur at an uneven time slot (1, 3, 5, 7, . . .)
at zero). The value n of a transferred digit can easily be determined from the pulse position:
Pulse position = (2 · n) + 1
(9.1)
The data rate resulting from the transmission period of a byte (4.833 ms) is 165 Kbit/s.
The beginning and end of a data transmission are identiﬁed by deﬁned frame signals – start-
of-frame (SOF) and end-of-frame (EOF). The coding of the SOF and EOF signals selected in the
standard is such that these digits cannot occur during a transmission of useful data (Figure 9.31).
The unambiguity of the frame signals is thus always ensured.
The SOF signal in ‘1 of 256’ coding consists of two 9.44-µs-long modulation pulses separated
by a time slot of 56.65 µs (9.44 µs × 4, Figure 9.32).
The EOF signal consists of a single modulation pulse lasting 9.44 µs, which is sent at an even
time slot in order to ensure its clear differentiation from a data byte (Figure 9.33).
9.2.3.2.3
‘1 of 4’ Coding
In this coding too, the time position of a modulation pulse determines the value of a digit. Two
bits are transmitted simultaneously in a single step; the value of the digit to be transferred thus
lies in the value range 0–3. The total transmission time for a byte is 75.52 µs, which corresponds
with eight time slots of 9.44 µs. A modulation pulse can only be transmitted at an uneven time slot

The data rate resulting from the time taken to transmit a byte (75.52 µs) is 26.48 Kbit/s.
In ‘1 of 4’ coding the SOF signal is made up of two modulation pulses lasting 9.44 µs separated
by an interval of 37.76 µs (Figure 9.34). The ﬁrst digit of the useful data begins after an additional
pause of 18.88 µs after the second modulation pulse of the SOF signal (Figure 9.35).

Data Transfer Card →Reader
Load modulation with a modulated subcarrier is used for the data transfer from a vicinity card
to a reader. The ohmic or capacitive modulation resistor is switched on and off in time with the
subcarrier frequency. The subcarrier itself is modulated in time with the Manchester coded data
stream, using ASK or FSK modulation (Table 9.14). The modulation procedure is selected by the
reader using a ﬂag bit (control bit) in the header of the transmission protocol deﬁned in Part 3 of
the standard. Therefore, in this case too, both procedures must be supported by the smart card.
The data rate can also be switched between two values (Table 9.15). The reader selects the data
rate by means of a ﬂag bit (control bit) in the header of the transmission protocol, which means
that, in this case too, the card must support both procedures.

ISO 10373 provided a standard relating to the testing of cards with and without a chip. In addition
to tests for the general quality characteristics, such as bending stiffness, resistance to chemicals,
dynamic torsional stress, ﬂammability, and dimensions of cards or the ultraviolet light resistance
of the data carrier (since EEPROM memories lose their content when irradiated with UV light
a special test has been developed to ensure nonsensitivity to this), speciﬁc test procedures have
also been developed for the latest methods of data transmission or storage (magnetic strips, contact,
contactless, optical). The individual test procedures for testing magnetic strips (ISO/IEC 7811), con-
tact smart cards (ISO/IEC 7816) or contactless smart cards (ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 15693) were
summarised in independent parts of the standard for the sake of providing an overview (Table 9.16).7

in the standard.
9.2.4.2.1
Calibration Coil
To facilitate the measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld strength generated by a reader without compli-
cated and expensive measuring equipment, the standard ﬁrst describes the layout of a calibration
coil that permits the measurement of magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the frequency range of 13.56 MHz
with sufﬁcient accuracy, even with a simple oscilloscope.
The calibration coil is based upon an industry-standard copper coated FR4 printed circuit board
and smart card dimensions in accordance with ISO/IEC 7810 (72 × 42 × 0.76 mm). A conductor
coil (i.e. a coil with one winding) with dimensions 72 × 42 mm is applied onto this base board
using the normal procedure for the manufacture of printed circuits. The sensitivity of the calibration
coil is 0.3 Vm/A. However, during the ﬁeld strength measurement particular care should be taken
to ensure that the calibration coil is only subjected to high-ohmic loads by the connected measuring
device (sensing head of an oscilloscope), as every current ﬂow in the calibration coil can falsify
the measurement result.
If the measurement is performed using an oscilloscope, then the calibration coil is also suitable
for the evaluation of the switching transitions of the ASK modulated signal from a reader. Ideally,
a reader under test will also have a test mode, which can transmit the endless sequence 10101010
for the simpler representation of the signal on the oscilloscope.
9.2.4.2.2
Measuring the Load Modulation
The precise and reproducible measurement of the load modulation signal of a proximity-coupling
smart card at the antenna of a reader is very difﬁcult due to the weak signal. In order to avoid the
resulting problems, the standard deﬁnes a measuring bridge, which can be used to compensate the
reader’s (or test transmitter’s) own strong signal. The measuring arrangement for this described in
the standard consists of a ﬁeld generator coil (transmission antenna) and two parallel sensor coils
in phase opposition. The two sensor coils (‘reference coil’ and ‘sense coil’) are located on the front
and back of the ﬁeld generator coil, each at the same distance from it, and are connected in phase
opposition to one another (Figures 9.36 and 9.37), so that the voltages induced in the coils cancel
each other out fully. In the unloaded state, i.e. in the absence of a load from a smart card or another

magnetically coupled circuit, the output voltage of this circuit arrangement therefore tends towards
zero. A low residual voltage, which is always present between the two sensor coils as a result of
tolerance-related asymmetries, can easily be compensated by the potentiometer.
The following procedure should be followed for the implementation of the measurement. The
smart card to be tested is ﬁrst placed on the measuring bridge in the centre of the sense coil. As a
result of the current ﬂowing through the smart card coil, a voltage us is induced in the neighbouring
sense coil. This reduces the symmetry of the measurement arrangement, so that an offset voltage
is set at the output of the measurement circuit. To prevent the falsiﬁcation of the measurement by
an undeﬁned offset voltage, the symmetry of the measurement arrangement must be recreated with
the measurement object in place by tuning the potentiometer. The potentiometer is correctly set
when the output voltage of the measurement bridge reaches a minimum (→0).
After the measurement bridge has been adjusted, the reader connected to the ﬁeld coil sends a
REQUEST command to the smart card under test. Now, if the smart card begins to send a response
to the reader by load modulation, the symmetry of the measuring bridge is disrupted in time with the
switching frequency (this corresponds with the subcarrier frequency fs) as a result of the modulation
resistor in the smart card being switched on and off. As a result, a subcarrier modulated RF voltage
can be measured at the measurement output of the measuring bridge. This signal is sampled over
several periods using a digital oscilloscope and then brought into the frequency range by a discrete
Fourier transformation. The amplitudes of the two modulation sidebands fc ± fs that can be seen

in the frequency range now serve as the quality criterion for the load modulator and should exceed
the limit value deﬁned in ISO/IEC 14443.
The layout of the required coils, a circuit to adapt the ﬁeld coil to a 50 transmitter output stage,
and the precise mechanical arrangement of the coils in the measuring arrangement are speciﬁed in
the Annex to the standard, in order to facilitate its duplication in the laboratory (see Section 14.4).
9.2.4.2.3
Reference Card
As a further aid, the standard deﬁnes two different reference cards that can be used to test the
power supply of a card in the ﬁeld of the reader, the transient response and transient characteristics
of the transmitter in the event of ASK modulation, and the demodulator in the reader’s receiver.
Power supply and modulation. With the aid of a deﬁned reference card it is possible to test
whether the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the reader can provide sufﬁcient energy for the operation
of a contactless smart card. The principal circuit of such a reference card is shown in Figure 9.38.
This consists primarily of a transponder resonant circuit with adjustable resonant frequency, a bridge
rectiﬁer, and a set of load resistors for the simulation of the data carrier.
To carry out the test, the reference card is brought within the interrogation zone of a reader
(the spatial characteristics of the reader’s interrogation ﬁeld are deﬁned by the manufacturer of
this device and should be known at the start of the measurement). The output voltage Umeas of
the reference card is now measured at deﬁned resonant frequencies (fres = 13–19 MHz) and load
resistances (910, 1800 ) of the reference card. The test has been passed if the voltage within the
interrogation zone does not fall below a lower limit value of 3 V.
Load modulation. A second reference card can be used to provide a test procedure that makes
it possible to test the adherence of the receiver in the reader to a minimum necessary sensitivity.
The circuit of this test card largely corresponds with the circuit from Figure 9.38, but it has an
additional load modulator.
To carry out the test, this reference card is brought into the interrogation zone of a reader, this
interrogation zone being deﬁned by the manufacturer. The reference card thus begins to transmit a
continuous subcarrier signal (847 kHz in accordance with ISO/IEC 14443) by load modulation to
the reader and this signal should be recognised by the reader within a deﬁned interrogation zone.
The reader under test ideally possesses a test mode for this purpose, in which the operator can be
alerted to the detection of a continuous subcarrier signal.

equipment and testing procedure for this largely correspond with the testing equipment deﬁned in
Part 6. The only differences are the different subcarrier frequencies in the layout of the reference
card (simulation of load modulation) and the different ﬁeld strengths in operation.

ISO/IEC 69873 – Data Carriers for Tools and Clamping Devices
This standard speciﬁes the dimensions for contactless data carriers and their mounting space in
tools and cutters (Figure 9.39). Normally the data carriers are placed in a quick-release taper shaft
in accordance with ISO/IEC 69871 or in a retention knob in accordance with ISO/IEC 69872. The
standard gives installation examples for this.
The dimensions of a data carrier are speciﬁed in ISO/IEC 69873 as d1 = 10 mm and t1 = 4.5 mm.
The standard also gives the precise dimensions for the mounting space.

ISO/IEC 10374 – Container Identiﬁcation
This standard describes an automatic identiﬁcation system for containers based upon microwave
transponders. The optical identiﬁcation of containers is described in the standard ISO/IEC 6346
and is reﬂected in the data record of the transponder-based container identiﬁcation.
Active – i.e. battery supported – microwave transponders are used. These are activated by an
unmodulated carrier signal in the frequency ranges 850–950 and 2400–2500 MHz. The sensitivity
of the transponder is deﬁned with an electric ﬁeld strength E of a maximum of 150 mV/m. The
transponder responds by backscatter modulation (modulated reﬂection cross-section), using a mod-
iﬁed FSK subcarrier procedure (Figure 9.40). The signal is modulated between the two subcarrier
frequencies 40 and 20 kHz.
The transmitted data sequence corresponds with the example in Table 9.17.

9.5.1.1
Ascertaining the False Alarm Rate
The number of false alarms should be ascertained immediately after the installation of the EAS
system during normal business. This means that all equipment, e.g. tills and computers, are in
operation. During this test phase the products in the shop should not be ﬁtted with security tags.
During a monitoring period of one to three weeks an observer records all alarms and the conditions
in which they occur (e.g. person in gates, cleaning, storm). Alarms that are caused by a security tag
being carried through the gates by accident (e.g. a tag brought from another shop) are not counted.

9.5.1.2
Ascertaining the Detection Rate
The detection rate may be ascertained using either real or artiﬁcial products.
Real products. In this case a number of representative products vulnerable to theft are selected
and carried through the gateways by a test person in a number of typical hiding places – hood,
breast pocket, shoe, carrier bag, etc. When selecting test products, remember that the material of a
product (e.g. metal surfaces) may have a quite marked effect on the detection rate.
The detection rate of a system is calculated as the proportion of alarms triggered to the totality
of tests carried out.
Artiﬁcial products. This test uses a wooden rod with a tag in the form of a label attached to the
middle. A test person carries this reference object through reference points in the gateway that are
precisely deﬁned by VDI 4470 at a constant speed.

Part 2 – Deactivation Devices – Inspection Guidelines
for Customers
As well as the option of removing hard tags (e.g. microwave systems) at the till, various tags can
also be ‘neutralised’, i.e. deactivated (e.g. RF procedure, electromagnetic procedure).
The objective is to achieve the complete deactivation of all tags placed in a deactivation device,
in order to avoid annoying or worrying customers by unjustiﬁed false alarms. Deactivation devices
must therefore generate optical or acoustic signals, which indicate either a successful or an unsuc-
cessful deactivation.
Deactivation devices are tested during the normal activities of the shop. A minimum of 60
protected products are required, which are checked for functionality before and after the test. The
protected products are each put into/onto the deactivation device one after the other and the output
from the signalling device recorded.
To ascertain the deactivation rate the successfully deactivated tags are divided by the total
number of tags. This ratio must be 1, corresponding with a 100% deactivation rate. Otherwise, the
test has not been successful.

9.6.1.1
ISO/IEC 15691 and 15692
To use an application to write data on a transponder or to read them out requires different processes.
Figure 9.43 shows a typical installation of an RFID system and the assignment of the different
processes to individual standards.
The application usually is installed on the control computer of a robot or on a central processor
sends out commands or when necessary also data (application command) to the control system of
the RFID reader (data protocol processor, DPP). Standard ISO/IEC 15691 speciﬁes the admissible
commands, responses or possible error messages.
If an application sends a write command with a data set to the reader, the command/response unit
(CRU), i.e. the reader’s control unit, will receive and evaluate the command. The memory of the
transponder is usually divided into blocks, and often even into superordinated segments. Therefore

it can only be read and written in blocks (see Section 10.1.3.4). The data sent by the application can
therefore not be written one-on-one into the transponder, but must be segmented and sent in a form
that corresponds to the segmentation of the transponder memory. Therefore the data will initially be
written into an intermediate memory, the logical memory. Here, a data compactor compresses the
data in order to save valuable storage space on the transponder. Using the mapping rules speciﬁed
in ISO/IEC 15692, the data is segmented in order to write them blockwise onto the transponder.
The data protocol processor itself does not communicate with the transponder, but activates the
tag driver which converts the command received by the application into the transponder-speciﬁc
write command, sends it to the transponder and receives the transponder’s response. The response
received by the transponder is converted into the corresponding application response and returned
to the CRU. The CRU now sends the received response back to the application.
The command for reading a memory range or a data object stored in the transponder works
according to the same principle. Only the sequence is somewhat different as the transponder’s
memory is initially read out sectorwise and blockwise and the received data are written into the
logical memory according to the mapping rules, before the CRU sends it on to the application.
The data to be written into the transponder are always interpreted and treated as data objects. A
data object is an array of bytes with a clearly speciﬁed meaning. In order to clearly differentiate
the data objects, they are preceded by an object ID (OID) which determines how the application
has to deﬁne the subsequent bytes. Standards ISO/IEC 8824-1 and ISO/IEC 9834-1 specify object
IDs for logistics applications and are also used for barcode readers.
At ﬁrst glance, the speciﬁed sequence appears rather complicated. The special advantage of
this procedure is that each application command can be processed completely independent of the
reader’s transmission frequency, the protocol deﬁned for the contactless transmission route and
the memory conﬁguration of the transponder. Such a system is very ﬂexible and can be easily
extended with future transponder types or even with new transmission processes or protocols at the
contactless interface without the necessity to adapt the application. If we write on a transponder
in a speciﬁc system implementation, it may be possible to read the transponder out in another,
completely unknown system implementation, without any problems and maybe even at the other
side of the world.

GTAG Initiative
A further initiative, GTAG (global tag), is jointly supported by the EAN (European Article Num-
bering Association) and the UCC (Universal Code Council). According to a statement by the two
organisations themselves, the work of EAN and UCC is ‘to improve supply chain management
and other business processes that reduce costs and/or add value for both goods and services, EAN
International and UCC develop, establish and promote global, open standards for identiﬁcation and
communication for the beneﬁt of the users involved and the ultimate consumer’ (EAN.UCC, 1999).
EAN.UCC systems are used worldwide by almost a million companies from extremely different
industries for the identiﬁcation of goods. The best known is the barcode, which can be found upon
all consumer goods, and which is read at the supermarket till. The codes used, however, do not
facilitate the classiﬁcation of the goods, but serve only as a unique identiﬁcation (AI = application
identiﬁer) that allows the item to be looked up in a database.
Electronic document interchange (EDI) (deﬁned in UN/EDIFACT) represents a further ﬁeld of
application of EAN.UCC systems (EAN.UCC, 2000).
The speciﬁcations currently under development facilitate the coexistence of barcode and
transponder with full compatibility from the point of view of the user. This permits ﬂowing
migration from barcodes to transponder systems, with the focus initially being placed upon
applications relating to transport containers and reusable packaging (Osborne, n.d.). The
requirements of such standardisation are diverse, since all parameters of such a system must be
precisely speciﬁed in order to guarantee that the transponder can be implemented universally. The
GTAG speciﬁcation of EAN.UCC will therefore deal with three layers: the transport layer, the
communication layer, and the application layer.
• The transport layer describes the physical interface between transponder and reader, i.e. trans-
mission frequency, modulation frequency and data rate. The most important factor here is the
selection of a suitable frequency so that EAN.UCC systems can be used worldwide without
restrictions and can be manufactured at a low cost. Furthermore, the GTAG speciﬁcation for the
transport layer will ﬂow into the future ISO/IEC 18000-6 standard (Osborne, n.d.).
• The communication layer describes the structure of the data blocks that are exchanged between
transponder and reader. This also includes the deﬁnition of an anticollision procedure, plus the
description of commands for the reading or writing of the transponder.
• The application layer includes the organisation and structure of the application data stored on the
transponder. GTAG transponders will include at least an EAN.UCC application identiﬁer (AI)
(EAN.UCC, 2000). This AI was developed for data carriers with low storage capacity (barcodes).
RFID transponders, however, permit additional data and provide the option of changing data in
the memory, so that the GTAG speciﬁcation will contain optional data ﬁelds and options.

frequency range is local differences in frequency regulations. For example, 4 W EIRP transmis-
sion power is available for RFID systems in the frequency range 910–928 MHz in America. In
Europe, the ERO (European Radiocommunications Organisation) has allocated 2 W ERP transmis-
sion power – corresponding to 3.8 W EIRP – to the frequency range 865.6–867.6 MHz.
Due to the different frequency ranges of the readers, GTAG transponders are designed so that
they can be interrogated by a reader over the entire 862–928 MHz frequency range. It makes no
difference in the case of backscatter transponders whether the reader uses a ﬁxed transmission
frequency (Europe) or changes the transmission frequency at periodic intervals (frequency hopping
spread spectrum, USA and Canada).
9.6.2.2
GTAG Communication and Application Layer
The GTAG communication and application layers are described in the MP&PR speciﬁcation (mini-
mum protocol and performance requirement). The MP&PR (GTAG-RP) deﬁnes the coding of data
on the contactless transmission path, the construction of a communication relationship between
reader and transponder (anticollision and polling), the memory organisation of a transponder, and
numerous commands for the effective reading and writing of the transponder.
The memory of a GTAG transponder is organised into blocks, each of 128 bits (16 bytes). The
GTAG speciﬁcation initially permits only the addressing of a maximum of 32 pages, so that a
maximum of 512 bytes can be addressed. However, it should be assumed that for most applications
it is sufﬁcient for a data set identical to the barcode in accordance with EAN/UCC-128 to be stored
in a page of the transponder.
9.6.3
EPCglobal Network
The EPCglobal Network is a technology that allows trading partners to document and determine
the location of individual goods and commodities within the supply chain, if possible in real time.
Even additional information about the goods and commodities, such as production and use-by date
of a product, can be easily exchanged between trading partners.

Standardisation
275
The EPCglobal Network uses the Internet, which is everywhere available today, and adds speciﬁc
services, such as Object Naming Service (ONS) and EPC Information Service (EPCIS). The objects
are registered with RFID readers that are connected via a software interface with the Internet
services of EPCglobal Network. The combination of data acquisition via RFID technology with
providing, distributing and connecting these data via existing Internet technology offers a large
potential not only for improved efﬁciency, but also for precise logistics processes in national and
international trading.
The EPCglobal Network deﬁnes and uses the following ﬁve basic services (EPCglobal, 2004):
• Electronic product code (EPC), a unique number for identifying individual objects in a supply
chain.
• The identiﬁcation system consisting of EPC transponder and readers. The transponder which is
attached to outer packages, palettes or individual products contains the electronic product code.
The readers can read out the EPC from the transponders and route it via EPC middleware into
the network.
• EPCglobal Middleware administrates the information made available by readers und constitutes
a software interface in the EPCglobal Network.
• Discovery Services (DS), a group of services that allow the user to ﬁnd data regarding a certain
EPC in the EPCglobal Network. The Object Naming Services (ONS) also belong to the Discovery
Services.
• EPC Information Services (EPCIS) that allow users to exchange EPC-related data via EPCglobal
Network with their trading partners.
For an initial overview of network functionalities, we will compare speciﬁc network services of
EPCglobal Network (Table 9.21) and the World Wide Web (according to McLaughlin, 2004).)
For data acquisition, cost-efﬁcient transponders are used. They only need a unique number – the
EPC – that is attached to the goods, commodities and other objects that move through the supply
chains of trading partners. Transponders will be read at strategically positioned readers within the
supply chain, such as at goods-in or goods-out points. Together with registration time, date and
location, the registered EPCs will then be forwarded to the EPCglobal Network. The middleware
on a local computer will serve as interface between local readers and EPCglobal Network.
Using Internet technology, the EPCglobal Network now forms a network that allows authorized
trading partners of a supply chain to exchange previously registered data. The Discovery Services
make it possible to ﬁnd EPC-related data in the EPCglobal Network. Access to EPC-related data
is controlled by EPC Information Services (EPCIS). Here, the companies themselves determine
which trading partner is given access to registered data. The result is an information network that
can be used for real-time tracking of goods through the supply chains.

Generation 2
In 1999, EPCs started when the especially founded Auto-ID-Center began to develop the necessary
technology and network architecture. The goal was to create a cost-efﬁcient, global and open-
source system. At this point it was decided to develop less complex original standards for the
communication between transponder and reader that could be implemented more cost-efﬁciently
than existing RFID standards (EPC Forum, n.d.).
In 2003, EAN international and UCC founded EPCglobal Inc. and thus created a worldwide,
open nonproﬁt organisation for the international implementation of EPCglobal Network. Taking on
the standardization work of the Auto-ID-Center, EPCglobal Inc. began to develop a new generation
of communication standards between transponder and reader, the so called Gen2 Protocol. The Gen2
standard provides a uniform, globally valid protocol which, however, is not backwards compatible
with the previous Auto-ID-Center standard (EPC Forum, n.d.).
The gen2 protocol has several advantages compared to the preceding version:
• A speciﬁc dense reader mode prevents adjacent readers from interfering.
• An improved segmentation of the memory supplied by the transponder into four independent
sectors. This way, individual users can write their own data, e.g. product and supply information,
on the transponder.
• Migration of barcode applications to transponders is facilitated as several transponders can get
an identical EPC which allows to treat transponders virtually as barcodes.
• A changed bit coding on the RF interface improves the detection rate of transponders to be read.
9.6.3.2
Standards and Speciﬁcations
EPCglobal Inc. provides speciﬁcations for EPCglobal Network in order to create international
standards for the operation and installation of the EPCglobal Network. Currently, the following

The Electronic Product Code (EPC)
The EPC is a sort of licence plate with a unique number which allows to clearly and individually
identify a marked object. As opposed to barcodes using barcode readers to assign a good to a
speciﬁc article, the EPC can also have a consecutive number which allows it to identify each
individual part of an article for itself.
The EPC is stored on the transponder as a string of bits. In general, the EPC consists of a header
with variable length and a number of data ﬁelds whose length, structure and function are determined
by the header value. Currently, EPCs with a total length of 64 bits and 96 bits are speciﬁed.
In addition to SGTIN-65 (serialized global trade item number) and SGTIN-96 encoding used by
the EPCglobal Network for article tagging, EPC also supports several other encoding schemes such
as GID-96 (general identiﬁer, 96 bit), SSCC (serial shipping container code), SGLN (serialized
global location number), GRAI (global individual asset identiﬁer) and the DoD identiﬁer (deﬁned
by the United States Department of Defense). Currently there are 13 different encoding schemes
deﬁned by EPCglobal. Table 9.22 presents the assignment of header values to different encoding
schemes (EPCglobal, 2005).
In the following, we will take a closer look at SGTIN and GIAI as examples for the encoding
of an EPC.

SGTIN
The SGTIN (serialized global trade item number) is used to unambiguously identify individual
goods in a supply chain. There is a 64-bit version and a 96-bit version of SGTIN.
As shown in Table 9.23, the 96-bit-long SGTIN-96 consists of six data ﬁelds, Header, Filter
value, Partition, Company preﬁx, Item reference and Serial number. SGTIN-96 starts with header
value 00110000b. The ‘Filter value’ is not a direct part of GTIN, but allows a preselection of
single shippings, such as a bicycle or a large TV, as well as of different types of standard trade
item groupings. The data ﬁelds ‘Company preﬁx’ and ‘Item reference’ can have varying lengths,
but have always to add up to 44 bits. The assignment of these 44 bits to the two ﬁelds is deﬁned
by the value of the ﬁeld ‘Partition’.
The ‘Company preﬁx’ contains a number that identiﬁes the company that issued the read-out
EPC, the EPCglobal Manager. Usually, this is the manufacturer of the product. The ﬁeld ‘Item
reference’ describes the article class, whereas the ‘Serial number’ is a consecutive number for
clearly identifying an article.
SGTIN resembles the widely spread EAN/UCC barcode. However, the latter only provides the
article class of the object, but not an individual number (Figure 9.47).

SGTIN-64 consisting of only 64 bits has a similar structure. As opposed to SGTIN-96, the
length of the data ﬁelds ‘Company preﬁx’ and ‘Item reference’ is constant and there is no data
ﬁeld ‘Partition’.
The encoding of the ‘Company preﬁx’ constitutes a singularity. It cannot be completely encoded
as there are only 14 bits available. Instead of a genuine value, there is only an index value. A
conversion table can be used to determine the genuine value of the ‘Company preﬁx’ where the
index simply provides the number of the line in the table. Tables for the code conversion of index
values in the ‘Company preﬁx’ can be downloaded from the website http://www.onsepc.com/. The

GIAI
The GIAI (global individual asset identiﬁer) generates an inventory of objects that are used within
a logistics chain, e.g. vehicles or machines. There is a 64-bit version (GIAI-64) and a 96-bit version
(GIAI-96).
The structure of GIAI is very similar to that of the previously described SGTIN. Data ﬁelds with
the same name also have the same function. Instead of ‘Company preﬁx” and ‘Item reference’, GIAI
has an individual inventory number, the ‘individual asset reference’ which is up to 62 bits long.

Transponder Classes
The transponders of EPCglobal Network are classiﬁed according to capacity. There are the following
classes:
Class 0
Passive read-only transponder with 64-bit or 96-bit EPC (only for frequency range 900 MHz)
Class 0+
Passive transponders, once writable, but readable with Class 0 protocol
Class I
Passive transponders, once writable with 64-bit or 96-bit EPC. Speciﬁed for frequency range
869–930 MHz as well as for 13.56 MHz
Class II
Passive transponders, once writable. The transponder has additional functions, such as
encryption
Class III
Active transponders (i.e. battery-driven), rewritable
Class IV
These transponders are small radio devices and can communicate with each other. The
transponders are rewritable
Class V
These transponders can communicate with each other, similarly to Class IV transponders. In
addition, they can communicate with passive or active Class I, II and III transponders
Gen 2
Passive transponders, once writable. It has a memory of at least 224 bits consisting of 96 bits
of EPC data, 32 bits data for error-correcting and a data range for the user. The transponder
also has a kill command. In the long run, Gen 2 transponders will replace Class 0 and Class
I transponders

Introduction into the EPC Network
As we have shown, EPC is only an identiﬁcation number for an object moving through the supply
chains of trading companies. All information about the object with the corresponding individual EPC
is exclusively administered in the EPCglobal Network. Each company in the EPCglobal Network
administers and controls the EPC data sets and object data of the EPCs hat it has issued. Access
rights to object data are locally conﬁgured on the individual EPCIS and can be accessed only by
trading partners with the corresponding privileges.

Requesting product data of an EPC from the manufacturer’s EPCIS
Figures 9.48–9.50 constitute a brief introduction to the EPCglobal Network and illustrate the
path of an object through the supply chain of two trading partners.
The life cycle of an EPC starts with the manufacturer of a product attaching the transponder(1)
to this product (McLaughlin, 2004). All data assigned to the product, such as production date or
date of expiration, are stored in the manufacturer’s EPCIS (2). EPCIS registers the entries with
EPC Discovery Services in order to ﬁnd the information in EPCglobal Network (3). Our product
is ﬁnally shipped (4) to a retailer.
At the retailer’s goods-in point, the corresponding data, such as date of receipt, are stored in the
retailer’s EPCIS (5) and ﬁnally registered by EPCIS with EPC Discovery Services (6).

282
RFID Handbook
In order to get object-related data of the received product via EPCglobal Network, the retailer
needs the IP address of the manufacturer’s EPCIS. To retrieve this address, the retailer at ﬁrst needs
the company preﬁx of the EPC attached to the product (1); the preﬁx will be sent on to the Root ONS
of the EPCglobal network (7). The Root ONS now provides the Internet address of the manufac-
turer’s local ONS; the item reference of the read-out EPC is sent to this address in order to receive
the Internet address of the manufacturer’s EPCIS. By requesting the EPCIS with the item reference
and serial number of the EPC, the retailer can now get all relevant data for the received product.
A more comprehensive introduction to the internal processes of the EPCglobal Network is
provided in Glover (2006).

The Architecture of Electronic
Data Carriers
Before we describe the functionality of the data carriers used in RFID systems we must ﬁrst
differentiate between two fundamental operating principles: there are electronic data carriers based
upon integrated circuits (microchips) and data carriers that exploit physical effects for data storage.
Both 1-bit transponders and surface wave components belong to the latter category.
Electronic data carriers are further subdivided into data carriers with a pure memory function
and those that incorporate a programmable microprocessor.
This chapter deals exclusively with the functionality of electronic data carriers. The simple
functionality of physical data carriers has already been described in Chapter 3.
10.1
Transponder with Memory Function
Transponders with a memory function range from the simple read-only transponder to the high-end
transponder with intelligent cryptological functions (Figure 10.2).
Transponders with a memory function contain RAM, ROM, EEPROM or FRAM and an RF
interface to provide the power supply and permit communication with the reader. The main distin-
guishing characteristic of this family of transponders is the realisation of address and security logic
on the chip using a state machine.
10.1.1
RF Interface
The RF interface forms the interface between the analogue, high-frequency transmission channel
from the reader to the transponder and the digital circuitry of the transponder. The RF interface
therefore performs the functions of a classical modem (modulator–demodulator) used for analogue
data transmission via telephone lines.
The modulated RF signal from the reader is reconstructed in the RF interface by demodulation to
create a digital serial data stream for reprocessing in the address and security logic. A clock-pulse
generation circuit generates the system clock for the data carrier from the carrier frequency of the
RF ﬁeld.
The RF interface incorporates a load modulator or backscatter modulator (or an alternative
procedure, e.g. frequency divider), controlled by the digital data being transmitted, to return data
to the reader (Figure 10.3).

The Architecture of Electronic Data Carriers
285
Passive transponders, i.e. transponders that do not have their own power supply, are supplied
with energy via the RF ﬁeld of the reader. To achieve this, the RF interface draws current from the
transponder antenna, which is rectiﬁed and supplied to the chip as a regulated supply voltage.
10.1.1.1
Example Circuit – Load Modulation with Subcarrier
The principal basic circuit of a load modulator is shown in Figure 10.4. This generates an ohmic
load modulation using an ASK or FSK modulated subcarrier. The frequency of the subcarrier and
the baud rates are in accordance with the speciﬁcations of the standard ISO 15693 (vicinity-coupling
smart cards).
The high-frequency input voltage u2 of the data carrier (transponder chip) serves as the time
basis of the RF interface and is passed to the input of a binary divider. The frequencies speciﬁed
in the standard for the subcarrier and the baud rate can be derived from the single binary division
of the 13.56 MHz input signal.

Generation of a load modulation with modulated subcarrier: the subcarrier frequency is generated
by a binary division of the carrier frequency of the RFID system. The subcarrier signal itself is initially ASK
or FSK modulated (switch position ASK/FSK) by the Manchester coded data stream, while the modulation
resistor in the transponder is ﬁnally switched on and off in time with the modulated subcarrier signal

The serial data to be transmitted is ﬁrst transferred to a Manchester generator. This allows
the baud rate of the baseband signal to be adjusted between two values. The Manchester coded
baseband signal is now used to switch between the two subcarrier frequencies f1 and f2 using the
‘1’ and ‘0’ levels of the signal, in order to generate an FSK modulated subcarrier signal. If the
clock signal f2 is interrupted, this results in an ASK modulated subcarrier signal, which means that
it is very simple to switch between ASK and FSK modulation. The modulated subcarrier signal is
now transferred to switch S, so that the modulation resistor of the load modulator can be switched
on and off in time with the subcarrier frequency.
10.1.1.2
Example Circuit – RF Interface for ISO 14443 Transponder
The circuit in Figure 10.5 provides a further example of the layout of an RF interface. This was
originally a simulator for contactless smart cards in accordance with ISO 14443, which can be used
to simulate the data transmission from the smart card to a reader by load modulation. The circuit
was taken from a proposal by Motorola for a contactless smart card in ISO 10373-6 (Baddeley and
Ruiz, 1998).
A complete layout is available for the duplication of this test card (see Section 14.4.1). The
circuit is built upon an FR4 printed circuit board. The transponder coil is realised in the form
of a large-area conductor loop with four windings of a printed conductor. The dimensions of the
transponder coil correspond with the ratios in a real smart card.
The transponder resonant circuit of the test card is made up of the transponder coil L1 and
the trimming capacitor CV 1. The resonant frequency of the transponder resonant circuit should be
tuned to the transmission frequency of the reader, 13.56 MHz (compare Section 4.1.11.2). The RF
voltage present at the transponder resonant circuit is rectiﬁed in the bridge rectiﬁer D1–D4 and
maintained at approximately 3 V by the Zener diode D6 for the power supply to the test card.
The binary divider U1 derives the required system clocks of 847.5 kHz (subcarrier, divider 1/16)
and 105.93 kHz (baud rate, divider 1/128) from the carrier frequency 13.56 MHz.
The circuit made up of U2 and U3 is used for the ASK or BPSK modulation of the subcarrier
signal (847.5 kHz) with the Manchester or NRZ coded data stream (jumper 1–4). In addition to
the simple inﬁnite bit sequences 1111 and 1010, the supply of an external data stream (jumper 10)
is also possible. The test smart card thus supports both procedures for data transfer between smart
card and reader deﬁned in ISO 14443-2.
Either a capacitive (C4, C5) or an ohmic (R9) load modulation can be selected. The ‘open
collector’ driver U4 serves as the output stage (‘switch’) for the load modulator.
The demodulation of a data stream transmitted from the reader is not provided in this circuit.
However, a very simple extension of the circuit (Figure 10.6) facilitates the demodulation of at least
a 100% ASK modulated signal. This requires only an additional diode to rectify the RF voltage of
the transponder resonant circuit. The time constant τ = R · C should be dimensioned such that the
carrier frequency (13.56 MHz) is still effectively ﬁltered out, but the modulation pulse (tpulse = 3 µs
in accordance with ISO 14443-2) is retained as far as is possible.
10.1.2
Address and Security Logic
The address and security logic forms the heart of the data carrier and controls all processes on
the chip.
The power-on logic ensures that the data carrier takes on a deﬁned state as soon as it receives
an adequate power supply upon entering the RF ﬁeld of a reader. Special I/O registers perform the
data exchange with the reader. An optional cryptological unit is required for authentication, data
encryption and key administration.

The data memory, which comprises a ROM for permanent data such as serial numbers, and
EEPROM or FRAM is connected to the address and security logic via the address and data bus
inside the chip.
The system clock required for sequence control and system synchronisation is derived from
the RF ﬁeld by the RF interface and supplied to the address and security logic module. The
state-dependent control of all procedures is performed by a state machine (hard-wired software).
The complexity that can be achieved using state machines comfortably equals the performance of
microprocessors (high-end transponders). However the ‘programme sequence’ of these machines is
determined by the chip design. The functionality can only be changed or modiﬁed by modifying
the chip design and this type of arrangement is thus only of interest for very large production runs.

10.1.2.1
State Machine
A state machine (also switching device, Mealy machine) is an arrangement used for executing
logic operations, which also has the capability of storing variable states (Figure 10.8). The output
variable Y depends upon both the input variable X and what has gone before, which is represented
by the switching state of ﬂip-ﬂops (Tietze and Schenk, 1985).
The state machine therefore passes through different states, which can be clearly represented in
a state diagram (Figure 10.9). Each possible state SZ of the system is represented by a circle. The
transition from this state into another is represented by an arrow. The arrow caption indicates the
conditions that the transition takes place under. An arrow with no caption indicates an unspeciﬁed
transition (power on →S1). The current new state SZ(t + 1) is determined primarily by the old
state SZ(t) and, secondly, by the input variable xi.
The order in which the states occur may be inﬂuenced by the input variable x. If the system is
in state SZ and the transition conditions that could cause it to leave this state are not fulﬁlled, the
system remains in this state.
A switching network performs the required classiﬁcation. If the state variable Z(t) and the input
variable are fed into its inputs, then the new state Z(t + 1) will occur at the output (Figure 10.8).
When the next timing signal is received this state is transferred to the output of (transition triggered)
ﬂip-ﬂops and thus becomes the new system state S(t + 1) of the state machine.

Memory Architecture
10.1.3.1
Read-Only Transponder
This type of transponder represents the low-end, low-cost segment of the range of RFID data
carriers. As soon as a read-only transponder enters the interrogation zone of a reader it begins to
continuously transmit its own identiﬁcation number (Figure 10.10). This identiﬁcation number is
normally a simple serial number of a few bytes with a check digit attached. Normally, the chip
manufacturer guarantees that each serial number is only used once. More complex codes are also
possible for special functions.

The transponder’s unique identiﬁcation number is incorporated into the transponder during chip
manufacture. The user cannot alter this serial number, nor any data on the chip.
Communication with the reader is unidirectional, with the transponder sending its identiﬁcation
number to the reader continuously. Data transmission from the reader to the transponder is not pos-
sible. However, because of the simple layout of the data carrier and reader, read-only transponders
can be manufactured extremely cheaply.
Read-only transponders are used in price-sensitive applications that do not require the option of
storing data in the transponder. The classic ﬁelds of application are therefore animal identiﬁcation,
access control and industrial automation with central data management.
10.1.3.2
Writable Transponder
Transponders that can be written with data by the reader are available with memory sizes ranging
from just 1 byte (‘pigeon transponder’) to 64 Kbytes (microwave transponders with SRAM).
Write and read access to the transponder is often in blocks. Where this is the case, a block is
formed by assembling a predeﬁned number of bytes, which can then be read or written as a single
unit. To change the data content of an individual block, the entire block must ﬁrst be read from
the transponder, after which the same block, including the modiﬁed bytes, can be written back to
the transponder.
Current systems use block sizes of 16 bits, 4 bytes or 16 bytes. The block structure of the
memory facilitates simple addressing in the chip and by the reader.
10.1.3.3
Transponder with Cryptological Function
If a writable transponder is not protected in some way, any reader that is part of the same RFID
system can read from it, or write to it. This is not always desirable, because sensitive applications

Block diagram of a writable transponder with a cryptological function to perform authentication

may be impaired by unauthorised reading or writing of data in the transponder. Two examples
of such applications are the contactless cards used as tickets in the public transport system and
transponders in vehicle keys for electronic immobilisation systems.
There are various procedures for preventing unauthorised access to a transponder. One of the
simplest mechanisms is read and write protection by checking a password. In this procedure, the
card compares the transmitted password with a stored reference password and permits access to
the data memory if the passwords correspond.
However, if mutual authorisation is to be sought, or it is necessary to check that both compo-
nents belong to the same application, then authentication procedures are used. Fundamentally, an
authentication procedure always involves a comparison of two secret keys, which are not trans-
mitted via the interface. (A detailed description of such procedures can be found in Chapter 8).
Cryptological authentication is usually associated with the encryption of the data stream to be
transmitted (Figure 10.12). This provides an effective protection against attempts to eavesdrop on
the data transmission by monitoring the wireless transponder interface using a radio receiver.
In addition to the memory area allocated to application data, transponders with cryptological
functions always have an additional memory area for the storage of the secret key and a conﬁg-
uration register (access register, Acc) for selectively write protecting selected address areas. The
secret key is written to the key memory by the manufacturer before the transponder is supplied to
the user. For security reasons, the key memory can never be read.
10.1.3.3.1
Hierarchical Key Concept
Some systems provide the option of storing two separate keys – key A and key B – that give
different access rights. The authentication between transponder and reader may take place using
key A or key B. The option of allocating different access rights (Acc) to the two keys may therefore
be exploited in order to deﬁne hierarchical security levels in an application.

A transponder with two key memories facilitates the hierarchical allocation of access rights, in
connection with the authentication keys used
Figure 10.13 illustrates this principle for clariﬁcation. The transponder incorporates two key
memories, which are initialised by the two keys A and B. The access rights that the readers are
allocated after successful authentication depend upon the setting that has been selected in the
transponder (access register) for the key that has been used.
Reader 1 is only in possession of key A. After successful authentication, the selected settings
in the access register (Acc) only permit it to read from the transponder memory. Reader 2, on the
other hand, is in possession of key B. After successful authentication using key B, the settings
selected in the access register (Acc) permit it to write to the transponder memory as well as reading
from it.
10.1.3.3.2
Sample Application – Hierarchical Key
Let us now consider the system of travel passes used by a public transport network as an example
of the practical use of hierarchical keys. We can differentiate between two groups of readers: the
‘devaluers’ for fare payments and the ‘revaluers’ which revalue the contactless smart cards.
The access rights to the transponder’s two access registers A and B are conﬁgured such that,
after successful authentication using key A, the system only permits the deduction of monetary
amounts (the devaluation of a counter in the transponder). Only after authentication with key B
may monetary amounts be added (the revaluation of the same counter).
In order to protect against attempted fraud, the readers in vehicles or subway entrances, i.e.
devaluers, are only provided with key A. This means that a transponder can never be revalued
using a devaluer, not even if the software of a stolen devaluer is manipulated. The transponder
itself refuses to add to the internal counter unless the transaction has been authenticated by the
correct key.
The high-security key B is only loaded into selected secure readers that are protected against
theft. The transponder can only be revalued using these readers.

294
RFID Handbook
10.1.3.4
Segmented Memory
Transponders can also be protected from access by readers that belong to other applications using
authentication procedures, as we described in a previous chapter. In transponders with large memory
capacities, it is possible to divide the entire memory into small units called segments, and protect
each of these from unauthorised access with a separate key. A segmented transponder such as this
permits data from different applications to be stored completely separately.
Access to an individual segment can only be gained after successful authentication with the
appropriate key. Therefore, a reader belonging to one application can only gain access to its ‘own’
segment if it only knows the application’s own key.
The majority of segmented memory systems use ﬁxed segment sizes. In these systems, the storage
space within a segment cannot be altered by the user. A ﬁxed segment size has the advantage that
it is very simple and cheap to realise upon the transponder’s microchip.
However, it is very rare for the storage space required by an application to correspond to the
segment size of the transponder. In small applications, valuable storage space on the transponder
is wasted because the segments are only partially used. Very large applications, on the other hand,
need to be distributed across several segments, which means that the application-speciﬁc key must
be stored in each of the occupied segments. This multiple storage of an identical key also wastes
valuable storage space.
A much better use of space is achieved by the use of variable length segments (Figure 10.15).
In this approach, the memory allocated to a segment can be matched to the requirements of the
application using the memory area. Because of the difﬁculty in realising variable segmentation,
this variant is rare in transponders with state machines.
Figure 10.16 illustrates the memory conﬁguration of a transponder with ﬁxed segmentation. The
available memory, totalling 128 bytes, is divided into four segments, known as ‘pages’. Each of
the four segments can be protected against unauthorised reading or writing by its own password.
The access register of this transponder (‘OTP write protection’) consists of an additional memory
area of 16 bits per segment. Deleting a single bit from the access register permanently protects 16
bits of the application memory against overwriting.

MIFAREApplication Directory
The memory of a MIFAREtransponder is divided into 16 independent segments, known as
sectors. Each sector is protected against unauthorised access by two different keys (hierarchical
structure). Different access rights can be allocated to each of the two keys in its own access
register (conﬁguration). Thus, 16 independent applications that are protected from each other by
secret keys can be loaded onto the transponder (Figure 10.17). None of the applications can be
read without the secret key, not even for checking or identiﬁcation. So it is not even possible to
determine what applications are stored on the transponder.
Let us now assume that the city of Munich has decided to issue a contactless City-Card, which
citizens can use to avail themselves of city services, and which occupies only a small part of
the available memory on the card. The remaining memory units on the card could be used by
other service providers for their own applications, such as local transport tickets, car rental, ﬁlling
station cards, parking passes, bonus cards for restaurants and supermarket chains, and many others.
However, we cannot ﬁnd out which of the many possible applications are currently available on
the card, because each reader belonging to an application only has access to its own sector, for
which it also has the correct key.
To get around this problem, the author, in conjunction with Philips Semiconductors Gratkorn
(was Mikron), has developed an application directory for the MIFAREsmart card. Figures 10.18
and 10.19 illustrate the data structure of this directory, the MAD (MIFAREapplication directory).
Blocks 1 and 2 of sector 0 are reserved for the MAD, leaving 32 bytes available for the application
directory. Two bytes of each make up a pointer, ID1 to ID Fh, to one of the remaining 15 sectors.
Reading the content of the pointer yields 2 bytes, the function cluster and the application code,
which can be used to look the application up in an external database. Even if the application
we are looking for is not registered in the available database, we can still gain an approximate
classiﬁcation from the function cluster, for example ‘airlines’, ‘railway services’, ‘bus services’,
‘city card services’, ‘ski ticketing’, ‘car parking’, etc.
Each application is allocated a unique identiﬁcation number, made up of the function cluster
code and application code. It is possible to request an identiﬁcation number from the developer of
MIFAREtechnology, Philips Semiconductors Gratkorn (Mikron) at Graz.
If a function cluster is set at 00 h, then this is an administration code for the management of
free or reserved sectors.

four ‘pages’ can be protected against unauthorised reading or writing using different passwords (IDESCO, n.d)
Sector 0 itself does not require an ID pointer, because the MAD itself is stored in sector 0. The
2 bytes that this leaves free are used to store an 8-bit CRC, which is used to check the MAD
structure for errors, and an info byte. A note can be recorded in the lowest 4 bits of the info byte,
giving the sector ID of the card publisher. In our example, this would be the sector ID of one of
the sectors in which the data belonging to the city of Munich is stored. This allows the reader to
determine the card publisher, even if more than one application is recorded on the smart card.
Another special feature is MAD’s key management system. While key A, which is required
for reading the MAD, is published, key B, which is required for recording further applications, is
managed by the card publisher. This means that joint use of the card by a secondary service provider
is only possible after a joint use contract has been concluded and the appropriate key issued.

Dual Port EEPROM
EEPROM modules with a serial I 2C (IIC) bus interface established themselves years ago, particu-
larly in consumer electronics. I2C bus is the abbreviation for Inter IC bus, because originally it was
developed for the connection of microprocessors and other ICs on a common printed circuit board.

The I2C bus is a serial bus and requires only two bidirectional lines, SDA (serial data) and SCL
(serial clock). A serial EEPROM can be read or written by the transmission of deﬁned commands
via the two lines of the I2C bus.
Some of these serial EEPROM modules now also have an RF interface and can thus be read or
written either via the two SDA and SCL lines or via the contactless interface. The block diagram
of such a dual port EEPROM (Atmel, 1998) is shown in Figure 10.20.
The EEPROM is accessed via two state machines (‘RF control’ and ‘serial control’) that are
largely independent of each other. The additional arbitration logic prevents conﬂicts as a result of
simultaneous access to the EEPROM via the RF and serial interfaces by simply blocking access to
the other interface for the duration of a write or read operation.
The RF interface of the module is designed for inductive coupling in the frequency range of
125 kHz. If no supply voltage is available via the Vcc pin of the module, then the dual port EEPROM
can also be supplied with power entirely via the RF interface. The integral power management
simply switches off parts of the circuit that are not required in pure contactless operation. The data
transfer from the serial EEPROM to a contactless reader takes place by ohmic load modulation in
the baseband. Commands from a reader are transferred to the dual port EEPROM by a simple ASK
modulation (modulation index m > 10%). See Figures 10.21 and 10.22 for the pin assignment and
memory conﬁguration.
The total memory space of 1 Kbyte (8 Kbit) available on the dual port EEPROM was divided
into eight segments (blocks 0–7). Each of these eight blocks was subdivided into eight subsegments
(pages 0–7), each of 16 bytes. An additional 16 bytes are available as an access protection page.
The structure of the access protection page is shown in Figure 10.23. The access protection page
permits different access rights to the eight blocks of the EEPROM to be set independently of each
other for the I2C bus and the RF interface. However, read and write access to the access protection
page itself is only possible via the I2C bus interface.

The access rights of the RF interface on memory block Y are deﬁned in the bits RF Y of the
access protection page, e.g. RF 7 contains the access rights on block 7 (Table 10.2). In a similar
manner, the access rights of the I2C bus interface are deﬁned on a memory block Y in the bit PBY
of the access protection page (PB5 contains access rights on block 5).
Furthermore, block 0 permits the access rights of the individual 16 byte pages of the block to be
set independently of each other. Bits WP7–WP0 of the access protection page serve this purpose.

page and the unique serial numbers. The access protection page permits different access rights to be set in the
memory for the RF and I2C bus interface
A peculiarity is the tamper bit in the access protection page. This bit can be set only to ‘1’ by the
RF interface and only to ‘0’ by the I2C bus interface. In this manner a previous write or read access
of the EEPROM via the RF interface can be signalled to the master of the connected I2C bus.
10.2
Microprocessors
Transponders with microprocessors will become increasingly common in applications using con-
tactless smart cards in the near future. Instead of the inﬂexible state machine, the transponder in
these cards incorporates a microprocessor.
Industry-standard microprocessors, such as the familiar 8051 or 6805, are used as the micro-
processor at the heart of the chip. In addition, some manufacturers offer simple mathematical
coprocessors (cryptological unit) on the same chip, which permit the rapid performance of the
calculations required for encryption procedures (Figure 10.24).
Contactless smart cards with microprocessors incorporate their own operating system, as has
long been the case in contact-based cards. The tasks of the operating system in a contactless smart
card are data transfer from and to the smart card, command sequence control, ﬁle management and
the execution of cryptographic algorithms (e.g. encryption, authentication).

The programme modules are written in ROM code and are incorporated into the chip at the chip
manufacturing stage by an additional exposure mask (mask programming).
The typical command processing sequence within a smart card operating system is as follows:
commands sent from the reader to the contactless smart card are received by the smart card via
the RF interface. Error recognition and correction mechanisms are performed by the I/O manager
irrespective of higher-level procedures. An error-free command received by the secure messaging
manager is decrypted or checked for integrity. After decryption the higher-level command
interpreter attempts to decode the command. If this is not possible, then the return code manager
is called, which generates the appropriate return code and sends it back to the reader via the I/O
manager (Figure 10.25).
If a valid command is received, then the actual programme code associated with this application
command is executed. If access to the application data in the EEPROM is necessary, this is
performed exclusively by the ﬁle management system and the memory manager, which convert all
symbolic addresses into the corresponding physical addresses of the memory area. The ﬁle manager
also checks access conditions (authorisation) for the data in question.
A more detailed introduction to the procedures for the development of operating systems and
smart card applications can be found in the book The Smart Card Handbook published by John
Wiley & Sons (Rankl and Efﬁng, 2010).

10.2.1
Dual Interface Card
The traditional key markets for contact smart cards are payment applications (cash card, electronic
purse) and mobile telephones (SIM card for GSM mobile telephone), applications that necessitate a
high degree of security in the processing and transmission of data. The resulting necessity of being
able to quickly and simply calculate complex cryptographic algorithms led to the development of
powerful cryptographic coprocessors on the card chips.
Contactless smart cards, on the other hand, are traditionally used in applications that require
a combination of user-friendliness (access control) and short transaction times (ticketing). The
trend towards combining payment applications with typical contactless applications (cash card with
ticketing function) ﬁnally led to the development of the dual interface card, in which both a contact
and a contactless interface are available on one chip. A dual interface card can thus be addressed
either via the contactless or the contact interface.

The philosophy underlying the dual interface card is that the smart card interface is completely
independent of the smart card logic or smart card software. The interface, whether contact or con-
tactless, is completely transparent to the transmitted application data so that, from the point of view
of the application software, the interface used is unimportant. The interface is thus exchangeable
at will, and interface and logic components can be combined as desired. The greatest advantage of
the dual interface card for the user and system operator is the option of being able to draw upon
existing infrastructure (generally contact readers) when introducing new applications. Also, from
the point of view of the security requirements of a smart card, there is no difference between a
contact and a contactless smart card. Due to the transparency of the interface, the replay and fraud
of security-related data that has been transmitted is effectively ruled out by the methods deﬁned in
ISO/IEC 7816 (e.g. ‘secure messaging’), regardless of the interface used.
The greatest difference between a contactless and a contact smart card is the power available. A
contactless smart card in accordance with ISO 14443 has only around 5 mW available for operation
at the maximum distance from the reader (Hmin = 1.5 A/m) (M¨uhlberger, 2001). A contact smart
card, on the other hand, may have 7.2 mW (GSM 11.13), 50 mW (GSM 11.11) or even up to 300 mW
(ISO 7816-3 Class A: 5 V, 60 mA) available, depending upon its speciﬁcation (Philipp, 2001).
This calls for completely new concepts in the development of contactless microprocessor chips.
For example, the use of a PMU (power management unit) on the chip, which can automatically
separate inactive circuit parts of the chip from the power supply to save energy, is recommended.
Furthermore, ultra-low-power and low-voltage technology is used in all dual interface chips so that
the available power can be optimally exploited.
An explicit switching between contactless and contact operation on the chip is not necessary.
In the simplest case it is sufﬁcient to use the validity of the data received via one of the two
interfaces as the evaluation criterion for further operation. Some chips provide the programmer
with status ﬂags that allow the currently active operating mode to be interrogated. Moreover, the
signals (frequency, voltage) present at the RF interface or the chip contacts are evaluated.
10.2.1.1
MIFAREPlus
The block diagram in Figure 10.28 shows a very early approach to the dual interface card. This
chip was developed jointly by Philips Semiconductors Gratkorn and Siemens HL (now Inﬁneon
AG) as early as 1997. Since it was not possible using the semiconductor technologies available at
the time to reliably operate a microprocessor with the power available via the contactless interface,
an unconventional solution was selected.
At the heart of this chip is an 8 Kbyte EEPROM memory, the Common EEPROM, in which the
application data was stored. In a similar manner to a dual port RAM, this common EEPROM can
be accessed via two interfaces that are completely separate from each other from the point of view
of circuitry. The inactive interface at any time is completely separated from the power supply of
the chip, so that the power available in contactless operation is used optimally.
The contactless interface is based upon a state machine, which forms a contactless MIFARE
memory card. From the point of view of a contactless reader this dual interface card thus behaves
like a memory card with a segmented EEPROM memory, in which the arrangement of the indi-
vidual segments and memory blocks are identical to that of a conventional MIFAREcard (see
Section 10.1.3.5).
The contact interface, on the other hand, is based upon a microprocessor with its own smart
card operating system. The above-mentioned memory segmentation is once again present when the
microprocessor accesses the common EEPROM. The operating system can therefore only read and
write the common EEPROM in blocks within the corresponding sectors.

the common EEPROM is accessed via a MIFARE-compatible state machine. When operating via the contact
interface a microprocessor with its own operating system accesses the same memory (reproduced by permission
of SLE 44R42, Inﬁneon AG, Munich)
In addition, the write and read rights for individual memory blocks of the common EEPROM can
be conﬁgured separately for the contactless and contact interface. These access rights are set and
monitored by the Access Conﬁguration Matrix. This also facilitates the realisation of hierarchical
security concepts.
10.2.1.2
Modern Concepts for the Dual Interface Card
Figure 10.29 shows the block diagram of a modern dual interface card. This card is based upon a
8051 microprocessor with a smart card operating system. The contactless interface is formed by a
CIU (contactless interface unit), which can be conﬁgured by the CPU via register addresses or can
also facilitate a status interrogation of the CIU.
A modern CIU automatically performs the transfer of a data block from and to a reader and
thereby automatically performs the necessary coding or decoding of the data stream according to
the speciﬁcations in the standard ISO/I EC14443-2 and ISO/I EC14443-3. Often it also performs
the automatic calculation and veriﬁcation of the transmitted CRCs.
To send a data block, the operating system only needs to store the data block to be sent in the
RAM memory of the chip and load the corresponding memory address and block length into the
conﬁguration register of the CIU. The CPU is no longer actively involved in the initiated data
transfer and can thus be switched into power-down mode (power-saving mode) for the duration of
the data transfer (M¨uhlberger, 2001). When a data block is received, the data from the CIU is then
automatically stored in the chip’s RAM and the CRC of the received block is veriﬁed.
Short transaction times represent a particularly important requirement for contactless applications.
For ticketing applications a maximum transaction time of 100 ms is a generally accepted value.
In order to facilitate the calculation of cryptographic functions within this short time interval,
many dual interface chips have cryptographic coprocessors. In banking applications, symmetrical
encryption algorithms such as DES (data encryption standard) and triple DES are normally used

in a contactless application. DES encryption can be calculated several hundreds of times quicker
using a coprocessor than is possible with the software solution (M¨uhlberger, 2001). The CPU need
only enter the data to be encrypted and the key in the correct register (DDAT and DKEY in
Figure 10.31) and start the calculation by means of a control register (DCNTRL).
Asymmetric key algorithms (‘public key’ procedures such as RSA) will become increasingly
important in future. Typical applications are electronic signatures (digital signature) or the validity

testing of electronic documents (certiﬁcation). Therefore, the ﬁrst dual interface chips already have
coprocessors for asymmetric algorithms (e.g. Fame PKI in Figure 10.29).
10.3
Memory Technology
After the state machine or microprocessor, the most important component of a data carrier is the
memory that user data is read from or written to. Read-only data is deﬁned at the manufacturing
stage by the chip mask (exposure mask) or permanently burnt into the memory by a laser. The
use of a laser also makes it possible to programme unique numbers (serial numbers that are issued
only once) or consecutive numbers into the data carrier.
If data is to be written to the data carrier, then RAM, EEPROM or FRAM cells are also
incorporated into the chip. However, only EEPROM and FRAM cells can store the written data
for long periods (typical retention periods are 10 years) without a power supply.
10.3.1
RAM
RAM is memory that can be used for the storage of temporary data. When the power supply is
removed, the stored data is lost forever. In transponders, RAM is mainly used for the temporary
storage of data that exists brieﬂy during operation in the interrogation zone of a reader. In active
transponders that have their own battery, RAMs with battery backups are sometimes used for the
long-term storage of data.
The main component of the (S)RAM memory cell is a D-ﬂip-ﬂop. Figure 10.32 shows the block
diagram for a single memory cell. Each memory cell has the connections DI (data input), WE
(write enable) and DO (data out). If data is only to be read from the memory cell, it is sufﬁcient
to activate the selected cell with logic 1 levels at the allocated address connections Yi and Xi.

To write data to the memory cell, the WE connection must also be switched to the 1 level. If
there is a 1 level at C1 input data is written to the ﬂip-ﬂop.
10.3.2
EEPROM
The operating principle of an EEPROM cell is based upon the ability of a capacitor (condenser)
to store electric charge over long periods. An EEPROM therefore represents a tiny capacitor that
can be charged or discharged. A charged capacitor represents a logic ‘1’, a discharged capacitor
represents a logic ‘0’.
In its simplest form, an EEPROM cell basically consists of a modiﬁed ﬁeld effect transistor on a
carrier material (substrate) made of silicon. The EEPROM cell contains an additional gate between
the control gate of the ﬁeld effect transistor and the substrate, which is not connected to an external
power supply, and which is positioned at a very short distance (∼10 nm) from the carrier material.
This so-called ﬂoating gate can be charged or discharged via the substrate using the tunnel effect,
and therefore represents a capacitor. For the tunnel effect to exist there must be a sufﬁciently large
potential difference at the thin insulating tunnelling oxidation layer between the ﬂoating gate and
the substrate.
The ﬂow of current between source and drain can be controlled by the stored charge of the
ﬂoating gate. A negatively charged ﬂoating gate gives rise to a high threshold voltage between the
source and drain of the ﬁeld effect transistor, meaning that this is practically blocked. The current
ﬂow through the ﬁeld effect transistor of an EEPROM cell is evaluated by signal ampliﬁcation of
the memory chip, whereby the strength of the current clearly indicates a ‘0’ or ‘1’.
To write a ‘0’ or ‘1’ to an EEPROM cell, a high positive or negative voltage is applied to the
control gate, which activates the tunnel effect. The voltage required to charge the EEPROM cell
is around 17 V at the control gate which falls to 12 V at the ﬂoating gate. However, RFID data
carriers are supplied with 3 or 5 V from the RF interface (or a battery). Therefore a voltage of 25 V
is generated from the low supply voltage of the chip using a cascaded charging pump integrated
into the chip, which provides the required 17 V after stabilisation.
It takes between 5 and 10 ms to charge an EEPROM cell. The number of possible write cycles is
limited to between 10 000 and 100 000 for EEPROM cells. This is because in every write operation
electrons are captured by the tunnelling oxidation layer and these are never released. These electrons
inﬂuence the threshold voltage of the ﬁeld effect transistor, with the effect becoming greater with
every write operation. As soon as this parasitic effect of the tunnelling oxidation layer becomes

The EEPROM cell consists of a modiﬁed ﬁeld effect transistor with an additional ﬂoating gate
greater than the primary inﬂuence of the ﬂoating gate the EEPROM cell has reached its lifetime
(Rankl and Efﬁng, 1996).
A charged ﬂoating gate loses its charge due to insulation losses and quantum mechanical effects.
However, according to semiconductor manufacturer’s ﬁgures, EEPROMs still provide reliable data
retention for 10 years. If the EEPROM cell is nearing its lifetime, then information is only stored
for short periods, which are determined by the parasitic inﬂuence of the oxide layer. For this reason,
a plausibility test should be carried out on stored data using checksums (e.g. CRC) in RFID data
carriers with EEPROM memories.
10.3.3
FRAM
High power consumption during writing and high write times of around 5–10 ms have a detrimental
effect on the performance of RFID systems that employ EEPROM technology. A new, non-transient
memory technology, which should improve this situation, has been under development for around
20 years: ferroelectric RAM, or FRAM . At the end of the 1980s the company Ramtron was
established, which collaborated with Hitachi on the development of this technology. The ﬁrst RFID
systems using FRAM technology were produced by the Ramtron subsidiary Racom. However, the
development of FRAMs is still associated with many problems, and so RFID systems using FRAMs
are still not widespread.
The principle underlying the FRAM cell is the ferroelectric effect, i.e. the capability of a material
to retain an electrical polarisation, even in the absence of an electric ﬁeld. The polarisation is based
upon the alignment of an elementary dipole within a crystal lattice in the ferroelectric material due
to the effect of an electric ﬁeld that is greater than the coercive force of the material. An opposing
electric ﬁeld causes the opposite alignment of the internal dipole. The alignment of the internal
dipole takes on one of two stable states, which are retained after the electric ﬁeld has been removed.
Figure 10.34 shows a simpliﬁed model of the ferroelectric lattice. The central atom moves into
one of the two stable positions, depending upon the ﬁeld direction of the external electric ﬁeld.
Despite this, FRAM memories are completely insensitive to foreign electric interference ﬁelds and
magnetic ﬁelds.
To read the FRAM cell (Figure 10.35), an electric ﬁeld (UCC) is applied to the ferroelectric
capacitor via a switching transistor. If the stored information represents a logic ‘1’ then the cell
is in position A on the hysteresis loop. If, on the other hand, it represents a logic ‘0’, the cell is
in position C. By the application of the voltage UCC we move to point B on the hysteresis loop,

FRAM cell structure (1 bit) and hysteresis loop of the ferroelectric capacitor
releasing electric charge, which is captured and evaluated by the signal ampliﬁers on the memory
chip. The magnitude of escaping charge clearly indicates a ‘1’ or ‘0’, because a signiﬁcantly greater
charge escapes in the transition from state A to B than in the transition from state C to B.
After the external (read) ﬁeld UCC has been removed, the FRAM cell always returns to state C,
and thus a stored ‘1’ is lost, because state C represents a ‘0’. For this reason, as soon as a ‘1’ is
read, the memory chip’s logic automatically performs a rewrite operation. This involves applying
an opposing electric ﬁeld −UCC to the ferroelectric capacitor, which changes the state of the FRAM
cell, moving it to point D on the hysteresis loop. After the removal of the electric ﬁeld the FRAM
cell falls into state D, which recreates the originally stored state A (Haberland, 1996).Writing a ‘1’
or ‘0’ to the FRAM cell is achieved simply by the application of an external voltage −UCC or +UCC.
After the voltage is removed the FRAM cell returns to the corresponding residual state A or C.
10.3.4
Performance Comparison FRAM – EEPROM
Unlike EEPROM cells, the write operation of a FRAM cell occurs at a high speed. Typical write
times lie in the region of 0.1 µs. FRAM memories can therefore be written in ‘real time’, i.e. in
the bus cycle time of a microprocessor or the cycle time of a state machine.

FRAMs also beat EEPROMs in terms of power consumption by orders of magnitude. FRAM
memory was therefore predestined for use in RFID systems. However, problems in combining
CMOS processors (microprocessor) and analogue circuits (RF interface) with FRAM cells on a
single chip still prevent the rapid spread of this technology.
10.4
Measuring Physical Variables
10.4.1
Transponder with Sensor Functions
Battery-operated telemetry transmitters in the frequency range 27.125 or 433 MHz are normally
used for the detection of sensor data. The ﬁelds of application of these systems are very limited,
however, and are restricted by their size and the lifetime of the battery.
Specially developed RFID transponders incorporating an additional A/D converter on the ASIC
chip facilitate the measurement of physical variables. In principle, any sensor can be used, in which
the resistance alters in proportion to physical variables. Due to the availability of miniaturised
temperature sensors (NTC), this type of system was ﬁrst developed for temperature measurement
(Figure 10.36).
Temperature sensor, transponder ASIC, transponder coil and backup capacitors are located in a
glass capsule, like those used in animal identiﬁcation systems (see Section 13.6.1). (Ruppert, 1994).
The passive RFID technology with no battery guarantees the lifelong functioning of the transponder
and is also environmentally friendly.
The measured value of the A/D converter can be read by a special reader command. In read-
only transponders the measured value can also be appended to a periodically emitted identiﬁcation
number (serial number).

Nowadays, the main ﬁeld of application for transponders with sensor functions is wireless tem-
perature measurement in animal keeping. In this application the body temperatures of domestic
and working animals are measured for health monitoring and breeding and birth control. The mea-
surement can be performed automatically at feed and watering points or manually using a portable
reader (Ruppert, 1994).
In industrial usage, transponders with a sensor function may be used anywhere where physical
variables need to be measured in rotating or moving parts where cable connections are impossible.
In addition to the classical temperature sensors a large number of sensors can already be inte-
grated. Due to their power consumption, however, only certain sensors are suitable for passive
(battery-free) transponders. Table 10.4 (B¨ogel et al., 1998) shows an overview of sensors that can
be used in active or passive transponders. Solutions that can be realised as a single chip are cheaper.
10.4.2
Measurements Using Microwave Transponders
Industry-standard microwave transponders can also be used to measure speed and distance by the
analysis of the Doppler effect and signal travelling times.
The Doppler effect occurs in all electromagnetic waves and is particularly easy to measure in
microwaves. If there is a relative movement between the transmitter and a receiver, then the receiver
detects a different frequency than the one emitted by the transmitter. If the receiver moves closer to
the transmitter, then the wavelength will be shortened by the distance that the receiver has covered
during one oscillation. The receiver thus detects a higher frequency.
If the electromagnetic wave is reﬂected back to the transmitter from an object that has moved,
then the received wave contains twice the frequency shift. There is almost always an angle α
between the direction of propagation of the microwaves and the direction of movement of the
‘target’. This leads to a second, expanded Doppler equation:
fd = fTX · 2v
c
· cos α
(10.1)
v =
fd · c
2fTX · cos α
(10.2)
The Doppler frequency fd is the difference between the transmitted frequency fTX and the
received frequency fRX. The relative speed of the object is v · cos α, c is the speed of light,
3 × 108 m/s.

The measurement of the speed or distance of a transponder is still possible if the transponder
is already a long way outside the normal interrogation zone of the reader, because this operation
does not require communication between reader and transponder.

10.4.3
Sensor Effect in Surface Wave Transponders
Surface wave transponders are excellently suited to the measurement of temperature or mechanical
quantities such as stretching, compression, bending or acceleration. The inﬂuence of these quantities
leads to changes in the velocity v of the surface wave on the piezocrystal (Figure 10.38). This leads
to a linear change of the phase difference between the response pulses of the transponder. Since
only the differences of phase position between the response pulses are evaluated, the measuring
result is fully independent of the distance between transponder and reader.
A precise explanation of the physical relationships can be found in Section 4.3.4.
The working range of surface wave transponders extends to low temperatures of −196 ◦C (liquid
nitrogen) and in a vacuum it even extends to very low temperatures.1
The normal surface wave crystals have only limited suitability for high temperatures. For
example, in lithium niobate segregation occurs at a temperature of just 300 ◦C; in quartz there
is a phase transition at 573 ◦C. Moreover, at temperatures above 400 ◦C the aluminium structure of
the interdigital transducer is damaged.
However, if we use a crystal that is suitable for high temperatures such as langasite with platinum
electrodes, surface wave sensors up to temperatures as high as around 1000 ◦C can be used (Reindl
et al., 1998c).
1 At very low temperatures, however, the sensitivity S of a SAW transponder ultimately tends towards zero.)

11.1
Data Flow in an Application
A software application that is designed to read data from a contactless data carrier (transponder) or
write data to a contactless data carrier, requires a contactless reader as an interface. From the point
of view of the application software, access to the data carrier should be as transparent as possible.
In other words, the read and write operations should differ as little as possible from the process of
accessing comparable data carriers (smart card with contacts, serial EEPROM).
Write and read operations involving a contactless data carrier are performed on the basis of
the master–slave principle (Figure 11.1). This means that all reader and transponder activities are
initiated by the application software. In a hierarchical system structure the application software
represents the master, while the reader, as the slave, is only activated when write/read commands
are received from the application software.
To execute a command from the application software, the reader ﬁrst enters into communication
with a transponder. The reader now plays the role of the master in relation to the transponder. The
transponder therefore only responds to commands from the reader and is never active independently
(except for the simplest read-only transponders. See Chapter 10).
A simple read command from the application software to the reader can initiate a series of
communication steps between the reader and a transponder. In the example in Table 11.1, a read
command ﬁrst leads to the activation of a transponder, followed by the execution of the authenti-
cation sequence and ﬁnally the transmission of the requested data.
The reader’s main functions are therefore to activate the data carrier (transponder), structure the
communication sequence with the data carrier, and transfer data between the application software
and a contactless data carrier. All features of the contactless communication, i.e. making the connec-
tion, and performing anticollision and authentication procedures, are handled entirely by the reader.
11.2
Components of a Reader
A number of contactless transmission procedures have already been described in the preceding
chapters. Despite the fundamental differences in the type of coupling (inductive – electromagnetic),
the communication sequence (FDX, HDX, SEQ), the data transmission procedure from the transpon-
der to the reader (load modulation, backscatter, subharmonic) and, last but not least, the frequency
range, all readers are similar in their basic operating principle and thus in their design.

Data to application
Readers in all systems can be reduced to two fundamental functional blocks: the control system
and the RF interface, consisting of a transmitter and receiver (Figure 11.2). Figure 11.3 shows a
reader for an inductively coupled RFID system. On the right-hand side we can see the RF interface,
which is shielded against undesired spurious emissions by a tinplate housing. The control system
is located on the left-hand side of the reader and, in this case, it comprises an ASIC module and
microcontroller. In order that it can be integrated into a software application, this reader has an
RS232 interface to perform the data exchange between the reader (slave) and the external application
software (master).
11.2.1
RF Interface
The reader’s RF interface performs the following functions:
• generation of high-frequency transmission power to activate the transponder and supply it with
power;
• modulation of the transmission signal to send data to the transponder;
• reception and demodulation of RF signals transmitted by a transponder.
The RF interface contains two separate signal paths to correspond with the two directions of
data ﬂow from and to the transponder (Figure 11.4). Data transmitted to the transponder travels

the differences between the different systems.
11.2.1.1
Inductively Coupled System, FDX/HDX
First, a signal of the required operating frequency, i.e. 135 kHz or 13.56 MHz, is generated in the
transmitter arm by a stable (frequency) quartz oscillator. To avoid worsening the noise ratio in
relation to the extremely weak received signal from the transponder, the oscillator is subject to
high demands regarding phase stability and sideband noise.
The oscillator signal is fed into a modulation module controlled by the baseband signal of the
signal coding system. This baseband signal is a keyed direct voltage signal (TTL level), in which
the binary data is represented using a serial code (Manchester, Miller, NRZ). Depending upon the
modulator type, ASK or PSK modulation is performed on the oscillator signal.

FSK modulation is also possible, in which case the baseband signal is fed directly into the
frequency synthesiser.
The modulated signal is then brought to the required level by a power output module and can
then be decoupled to the antenna box.
The receiver arm begins at the antenna box, with the ﬁrst component being a steep edge bandpass
ﬁlter or a notch ﬁlter. In FDX/HDX systems this ﬁlter has the task of largely blocking the strong
signal from the transmission output module and ﬁltering out just the response signal from the
transponder. In subharmonic systems, this is a simple process, because transmission and reception
frequencies are usually a whole octave apart. In systems with load modulation using a subcarrier
the task of developing a suitable ﬁlter should not be underestimated because, in this case, the
transmitted and received signals are only separated by the subcarrier frequency. Typical subcarrier
frequencies in 13.56 MHz systems are 847 or 212 kHz.
Some LF systems with load modulation and no subcarrier use a notch ﬁlter to increase the
modulation depth (duty factor) – the ratio of the level to the load modulation sidebands – and thus
the duty factor by reducing their own carrier signal. A different procedure is the rectiﬁcation and
thus demodulation of the (load) amplitude modulated voltage directly at the reader antenna. A
sample circuit for this can be found in Section 11.3.
11.2.1.2
Microwave Systems – Half-Duplex
The main difference between microwave systems and low-frequency inductive systems is the fre-
quency synthesising: the operating frequency, typically 2.45 GHz, cannot be generated directly by
the quartz oscillator, but is created by the multiplication (excitation of harmonics) of a lower oscil-
lator frequency. Because the modulation is retained during frequency multiplication, modulation is
performed at the lower frequency.
Some microwave systems employ a directional coupler to separate the system’s own transmission
signal from the weak backscatter signal of the transponder (Integrated Silicon Design, 1996).
A directional coupler (Figure 11.6) consists of two continuously coupled homogeneous wires
(Meinke and Gundlack, 1992). If all four ports are matched and power P1 is supplied to port 1, then
the power is divided between ports 2 and 3, with no power occurring at the decoupled port 4. The
same applies if power is supplied to port 3, in which case the power is divided between ports 1 and 2.
A directional coupler is described by its coupling loss:
ak = −20 · ln

(11.1)

Readers
321
and directivity:
aD = −20 · ln
P 4⃝

P 2⃝

(11.2)
Directivity is the logarithmic magnitude of the ratio of undesired overcoupled power P4 to
desired coupled power P2.
A directional coupler for a backscatter RFID reader should have the maximum possible directivity
to minimise the decoupled signal of the transmitter arm at port 4. The coupling loss, on the other
hand, should be low to decouple the maximum possible proportion of the reﬂected power P2 from
the transponder to the receiver arm at port 4. When a reader employing decoupling based upon a
directional coupler is commissioned, it is necessary to ensure that the transmitter antenna is well
(anechoically) set up. Power reﬂected from the antenna due to poor adjustment is decoupled at
port 4 as backward power. If the directional coupler has a good coupling loss, even a minimal
mismatching of the transmitter antenna (e.g. by environmental inﬂuences) is sufﬁcient to increase
the backward-travelling power to the magnitude of the reﬂected transponder power. Nevertheless,
the use of a directional coupler gives a signiﬁcant improvement compared with the level ratios
achieved with a direct connection of transmitter output module and receiver input.
11.2.1.3
Sequential Systems – SEQ
In a sequential RFID system the RF ﬁeld of the reader is only ever transmitted brieﬂy to supply
the transponder with power and/or send commands to the transponder.

RF interface for a sequential reader system
The transponder transmits its data to the reader while the reader is not transmitting. The transmit-
ter and receiver in the reader are thus active sequentially, like a walkie-talkie, which also transmits
and receives alternately.
The reader contains an instantaneous switching unit to switch between transmitter and receiver
mode. This function is normally performed by PIN diodes in radio technology.
No special demands are made of the receiver in an SEQ system. Because the strong signal of the
transmitter is not present to cause interference during reception, the SEQ receiver can be designed
to maximise sensitivity. This means that the range of the system as a whole can be increased to
correspond with the energy range, i.e. the distance between reader and transponder at which there
is just enough energy for the operation of the transponder.
11.2.1.4
Microwave System for SAW Transponders
A short electromagnetic pulse transmitted by the reader’s antenna is received by the antenna of
the surface wave transponder and converted into a surface wave in a piezoelectric crystal. A
characteristic arrangement of partially reﬂective structures in the propagation path of the surface
wave gives rise to numerous pulses, which are transmitted back from the transponder’s antenna
as a response signal (a much more comprehensive description of this procedure can be found in
Section 4.3).
Due to the propagation delay times in the piezoelectric crystal the coded signal reﬂected by the
transponder can easily be separated in the reader from all other electromagnetic reﬂections from
the vicinity of the reader (see Section 4.3.3). The block diagram of a reader for surface wave
transponders is shown in Figure 11.8.
A stable frequency and phase oscillator with a surface wave resonator is used as the high-
frequency source. Using a rapid RF switch, short RF pulses of around 80 ns duration are generated
from the oscillator signal, which are ampliﬁed to around 36 dBm (4 W peak) by the connected
power output stage, and transmitted by the reader’s antenna.
If a SAW transponder is located in the vicinity of the reader it reﬂects a sequence of individual
pulses after a propagation delay time of a few microseconds. The pulses received by the reader’s
antenna pass through a low-noise ampliﬁer and are then demodulated in a quadrature demodulator.
This yields two orthogonal components (I and Q), which facilitate the determination of the phase
angle between the individual pulses and between the pulses and the oscillator (Bulst et al., 1998).
The information obtained can be used to determine the distance or speed between SAW transponder
and reader and for the measurement of physical quantities (see Section 10.4.3).

To be more precise, the reader circuit in Figure 11.8 corresponds with a pulse radar, like those
used in ﬂight navigation (although in this application the transmission power is much greater). In
addition to the pulse radar shown here, other radar types (for example FM-CW radar) are also in
development as readers for SAW transponders.
11.2.2
Control Unit
The reader’s control unit (Figure 11.9) performs the following functions:
• communication with the application software and the execution of commands from the application
software;
• control of the communication with a transponder (master–slave principle);
• signal coding and decoding (Figure 11.10).

Signal coding and decoding is also performed by the control unit in the reader
In more complex systems the following additional functions are available:
• execution of an anticollision algorithm;
• encryption and decryption of the data to be transferred between transponder and reader;
• performance of authentication between transponder and reader.
The control unit is usually based upon a microprocessor to perform these complex functions.
Cryptological procedures, such as stream ciphering between transponder and reader, and also signal
coding, are often performed in an additional ASIC module to relieve the processor of calculation
intensive processes. For performance reasons the ASIC is accessed via the microprocessor bus
(register orientated).
Data exchange between application software and the reader’s control unit is performed by an
RS232 or RS485 interface. As is normal in the PC world, NRZ coding (8-bit asynchronous) is used.
The baud rate is normally a multiple of 1200 Bd (4800 Bd, 9600 Bd, etc.). Various, often self-
deﬁned, protocols are used for the communication protocol. Please refer to the handbook provided
by your system supplier.
The interface between the RF interface and the control unit represents the state of the RF interface
as a binary number. In an ASK modulated system a logic ‘1’ at the modulation input of the RF
interface represents the state ‘RF signal on’; a logic ‘0’ represents the state ‘RF signal off’ (for
further information see Section 10.1.1).
11.3
Integrated Reader ICs
It is typical of RFID applications that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the very large
number of transponders used and the corresponding number of readers. In the early stages of RFID
systems, small unit numbers as well as nonexistent standards for transmission procedures resulted
in that readers still consisted of discrete components. Development costs were high as readers were

Readers
325
correspondingly large and expensive. As a result, readers were only manufactured in small batches
of a few thousand.
In the early 1990s, demand for readers soared with the introduction of electronic immobilisation
systems. In addition, these applications require almost the same number of transponders and readers
as each vehicle has to be equipped with a reader. Since 1995 almost all new cars have been ﬁtted
with electronic immobilisation systems as standard, which means that the number of readers reached
a completely new order of magnitude. The automotive supplier market is very price sensitive; and
cost reduction and miniaturisation through integrating a small number of functional modules became
worth pursuing. Now it became possible to integrate the whole analogous section of a reader onto
a silicon chip, with only a few external components being necessary. For the required low bit rates,
microprocessors could be used to encode and decode the signal. An example of such an integrated
RF interface will be presented in the following Section 11.3.1.
In the late 1990s, RFID systems were increasingly used in mass applications. Modern contactless
ticketing systems, contactless payment transactions, electronic passports or the electronic product
code (EPC) require millions of transponders and simultaneously a correspondingly large number
of readers. And above all, today there are standards available which means that one and the same
reader can be used in different applications. Ticketing and payment transaction applications as well
as electronic passports exclusively use ISO/IEC 144443 as transmission standards. Applications
in the goods and item logistics conform with ISO/IEC 18000-6, ISO/IEC 180000-3 or ISO/IEC
15693. Reader reusability in different applications and the demand for large numbers of readers
ﬁnally resulted in the development of highly integrated single-chip reader ICs that enable a fast
and cost-efﬁcient development and production of readers. Section 11.3.2 presents an example of a
single-chip reader IC and an application example.
11.3.1
Integrated RF Interface
We will describe Atmel’s U2270B as an example of a fully integrated RF interface in the frequency
range of 125 kHz.
The IC contains the following modules: on-chip oscillator, driver, received signal conditioning
and an integral power supply.
The on-chip oscillator generates the operating frequency in the range 100–150 kHz. The precise
frequency is adjusted by an external resistor at pin RF. The downstream driver generates the power

Block diagram of the reader IC U2270B. The transmitter arm consists of an oscillator and
driver to supply the antenna coil. The receiver arm consists of ﬁlter, ampliﬁer and a Schmitt trigger (reproduced
by permission of TEMIC Semiconductor GmbH, Heilbronn)
required to control the antenna coil as push–pull output. If necessary, a baseband modulation signal
can be fed into pin CFE as a TTL signal and this switches the RF signal on or off, generating an
ASK modulation ASK 100%).
The load modulation procedure in the transponder generates a weak amplitude modulation of the
reader’s antenna voltage. The modulation in the transponder occurs in the baseband, i.e. without the
use of a subcarrier. The transponder modulation signal can be reclaimed simply by demodulating the
antenna voltage at the reader, using a diode. The signal, which has been rectiﬁed by an external diode
and smoothed using an RC low-pass ﬁlter, is fed into the ‘input’ pin of the U2270B (Figure 11.13).
Using a downstream Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter, an ampliﬁer module and a Schmitt trigger, the
demodulated signal is converted into a TTL signal, which can be evaluated by the downstream
microprocessor. The time constants of the Butterworth ﬁlter are designed so that a Manchester or
bi-phase code can be processed up to a data rate of fosc/25 (approximately 4.8 bit/s, TEMIC, 1977).

Figure 11.14
Complete application example of a low-cost reader IC U2270B (reproduced by permission of
TEMIC Semiconductor GmbH, Heilbronn)
Figure 11.14 shows a complete application circuit for the U2270B. A microprocessor generates
the digital baseband signal that is required for modulating the transmitter in the U2270B. The
processor compiles the data to be transmitted in a protocol frame and applies the corresponding
software to carry out a bitwise data encoding. Entering the serial signal at Pin CFE of the U2270B
generates an ASK modulation with data pulse (also see Figure 11.10).
The U2270B exports the bitstream received by the transponder as a digital baseband signal to
Pin OUTPUT and the microprocessor (see Figure 11.10). The microprocessor uses software to
decode the baseband signal and re-compiles individual bits into a protocol frame that also contains
payload data.
11.3.2
Single-Chip Reader IC
RFID standards in the frequency range 13.56 MHz (for example ISO/IEC 14443, ISO/IEC 15693
or ISO/IEC 18000-3) have high bitrates (up to 848 kBit/s), anticollision algorithms and complex
protocol frames for data transmission. A complete encoding and decoding of baseband signals
and protocol frames in a reader’s microprocessor would result in an expensive and fault-prone
software development and high demands on the microprocessor’s processing speed. In order to
facilitate the reader development there is a large number of highly integrated single-chip reader
ICs on the market.
Single-chip reader ICs encode and decode the signals to be sent and received and automatically
generate the protocol frame. They can also calculate checksums (CRC), detect transmission errors
and partially control the data stream.
NXP Semiconductors’ MFRC-522 is an example of such a single-chip reader IC) (MFRC522,
2007). Figure 11.15 shows the block diagram of an RC-522. This component supports the commu-
nication with both ISO/IEC 14443-A transponders and the MIFARE transponders.

Block diagram of single-chip reader IC MFRC-522
RC-522 has an analogous circuit, a contactless UART, a FIFO buffer, a job control (status and
control) as well as a host interface for connecting the component to a microprocessor. The buffered
output driver of RC-522 enables the direct connection of the sending and receiving antenna without
an additional active power ampliﬁer. Only few additional passive components for antenna adaption
are required. The analogous circuit completely takes over the demodulation and decoding of the
data re-sent by the transponder. The contactless UART generates the protocol frames according to
ISO/IEC 14443-A, or the proprietory MIFARE speciﬁcation. Also the corresponding error detection
(parity and CRC) in the received protocol frames occurs in the contactless UART. The FIFO buffer
allows sending and receiving data blocks of a maximum of 64 bBytes in one block. Chaining can
be used to segment and sequentially transmit larger data blocks.
A large number of registers that can be accessed by the connected microprocessor for read
and write operations is used for programming RC-522 as well as for reading and writing data to
the module. Table 11.2 presents a selection of the most important registers of the module. Using
registers makes prompting RC-522 signiﬁcantly easier. This way, multiple write and read operations
of FIFO register FIFODataReg is used to write the data blocks to be sent to the module’s FIFO.
Data received by the transponder can be easily read out of the module if the same register is read
out several times. By reading out different registers it it possible, for instance, to detect CRC or
parity errors occurring during data reception. Further registers are used to set desired RF interface
parameters, such as bitrate and pulse width, or to generally retrieve the status of RC-522.
The register itself can be accessed through three available interfaces: the I2C or RS232 interface or
via an SPI (serial peripheral interface). Programming register access is quite simple as Listing 11.1
shows for the example of the I2C interface.
Figure 11.16 shows a simple application example of a RC-522. Based on this application,
Figure 11.17 shows the diagram of a fully operational reader. The block diagram of this reader in
Figure 11.18 shows important functional components of this device1.
In addition to RC-522 (IC4), the circuit consists of an 8051 compatible microprocessor (IC3)
and a USB/RS232 interface module (IC1). The microprocessor has a 16 kByte ﬂash and can be
easily programmed with any 8051 compiler. The USB/RS232 interface module FT232R facilitates
communication with PCs.

The stand-alone operation of the circuit requires only a power-supply unit with 300 mA current
for an output voltage of 5 V DC. If the circuit is operated at a USB port of a PC, no external
voltage supply is necessary. The reader is operated as a bus-powered device and, as such a high-
power device, it can tolerate up to 500 mA after the successful USB-bus enumeration. In order to
prevent an early connection of the reader, signal PWREN of the USB interface module switches
transistor T2 to conductive only after the successful enumeration. Subsequently also RC-522 and
the microprocessor are supplied with operating voltage (Schalk, 2006).
The microprocessor only needs two cycles per command and is clocked with 16 MHz. This speed
and the 16 kByte ﬂash memory are sufﬁcient for a variety of reader applications. If necessary, an
LCD display can be connected to I/O port P0. Due to the vacant I/O port P2 as well as the
microprocessor’s available I2C and SPI interfaces, additional hardware modules can be easily
connected.
The reader’s layout and component diagram can be found in the book’s appendix (see Section
14.4.3). A complete circuit board and software for the microprocessor – and even for an installation
on the PC – can be ordered via the Internet.

Connection of Antennas for Inductive Systems
Reader antennas in inductively coupled RFID systems generate magnetic ﬂux , which is used
for the power supply of the transponder and for sending messages between the reader and the
transponder. This gives rise to three fundamental design requirements for a reader antenna:
• maximum current i1 in the antenna coil, for maximum magnetic ﬂux ;
• power matching so that the maximum available energy can be used for the generation of the
magnetic ﬂux;
• sufﬁcient bandwidth for the undistorted transmission of a carrier signal modulated with data.
Depending upon the frequency range, different procedures can be used to connect the antenna
coil to the transmitter output of the reader: direct connection of the antenna coil to the power output
module using power matching, or the supply of the antenna coil via coaxial cable.

11.4.1
Connection Using Current Matching
In typical low-cost readers in the frequency range below 135 kHz, the RF interface and antenna
coil are mounted close together (a few centimetres apart), often on a single printed circuit board.
Because the geometric dimensions of the antenna supply line and antenna are smaller than the
wavelength of the generated RF current (2200 m) by powers of ten, the signals may be treated as
stationary for simpliﬁcation. This means that the wave characteristics of a high-frequency current
may be disregarded. The connection of an antenna coil is thus comparable to the connection of a
loudspeaker to an NF output module from the point of view of circuitry.
The reader IC U2270B, which was described in the preceding section, can serve as an example
of such a low-cost reader.
Figure 11.19 shows an example of an antenna circuit. The antenna is fed by the push–pull
bridge output of the reader IC. In order to maximise the current through the antenna coil, a serial
resonant circuit is created by the serial connection of the antenna coil LS to a capacitor CS and a
resistor RS. Coil and capacitor are dimensioned such that the resonant frequency f0 is as follows
at the operating frequency of the reader:
f0 =
1
2π√Ls · Cs
(11.3)
The coil current is then determined exclusively by the series resistor RS.
11.4.2
Supply via Coaxial Cable
At frequencies above 1 MHz, or in the frequency range 135 kHz if longer cables are used, the RF
voltage can no longer be considered stationary, but must be treated as an electromagnetic wave
in the cable. Connecting the antenna coil using a long, unshielded two-core wire in the RF range
would therefore lead to undesired effects, such as power reﬂections, impedance transformation and
parasitic power emissions, due to the wave nature of a RF voltage. Because these effects are difﬁcult
to control when they are not exploited intentionally, shielded cable – so-called coaxial cable – is

Connection of an antenna coil using 50  technology
normally used in radio technology. Sockets, plugs and coaxial cable are uniformly designed for a
cable impedance of 50  and, being a mass produced product, are correspondingly cheap. RFID
systems generally use 50  components.
The block diagram of an inductively coupled RFID system using 50  technology shows the
most important RF components.
The antenna coil L1 represents an impedance ZL in the operating frequency range of the RFID
system. To achieve power matching with the 50  system, this impedance must be transformed to
50  (matched) by a passive matching circuit. Power transmission from the reader output module
to the matching circuit is achieved (almost) without losses or undesired radiation by means of a
coaxial cable.
A suitable matching circuit can be realised using just a few components. The circuit illustrated
in Figure 11.22, which can be constructed using just two capacitors, is very simple to design
(Suckrow, 1997). This circuit is used in practice in various 13.56 MHz RFID systems.

Reader with integral antenna and matching circuit (MIFARE-reader, reproduced by permission

Figure 11.23 shows a reader with an integral antenna for a 13.56 MHz system. Coaxial cable has
not been used here, because a very short supply line can be realised by a suitable layout (stripline).
The matching circuit is clearly visible on the inside of the antenna coil (SMD component).
Before we can dimension the circuit, we ﬁrst need to determine the impedance ZA of the antenna
coil for the operating frequency by measurement. It is clear that the impedance of a real antenna coil
is generated by the serial connection of the coil inductance LS with the ohmic wire resistance RLS
of the wire. The serial connection from XLS and RLS can also be represented in the impedance level.
The function of the matching circuit is the transformation of the complex coil impedance ZA to
a value of 50  real. A reactance (capacitance, inductance) in series with the coil impedance ZA
shifts the total impedance Z in the direction of the jX axis, while a parallel reactance shifts the
total impedance away from the origin in a circular path.

The values of C2p and C2s are dimensioned such that the resulting coil impedance ZA is trans-

(Z-level), we ﬁnd the following relationship for C2p:
C2p =

Z0 · RLs −R2
Ls
ωZ0RLS
(11.5)
As is clear from the impedance plane in Figure 11.25, C2p is determined exclusively by the series
resistance Rls of the antenna coil. For a series resistance RLS of precisely 50 , C2p can be dispensed
with altogether; however greater values for Rls are not permissible, otherwise a different matching
circuit should be selected (Fricke et al., 1979).
We further ﬁnd for Cls:

To clarify the relationships, let us now modify the matching circuit from Figure 11.22 slightly.
The input impedance of the circuit at operating frequency is precisely 50 . For this case, and
only for this case(!), the voltage at the input of the matching circuit is very simple to calculate.
Given a known transmitter output power P and known input impedance Z0, the following is
true: P = U2/Z0. The voltage calculated from this equation is the voltage at C2p and the series
connection of Cls, Rls and XLS, and is thus known. The antenna current i2 can be calculated using
the following equation:

The Inﬂuence of the Q Factor
A reader antenna for an inductively coupled RFID system is characterised by its resonant frequency
and by its Q factor. A high Q factor leads to high current in the antenna coil and thus improves
the power transmission to the transponder. In contrast, the transmission bandwidth of the antenna is
inversely proportional to the Q factor. A low bandwidth, caused by an excessively high Q factor,
can therefore signiﬁcantly reduce the modulation sideband received from the transponder.
The Q factor of an inductive reader antenna can be calculated from the ratio of the inductive
coil resistance to the ohmic loss resistance and/or series resistance of the coil:
Q = 2π · f0 · Lcoil
Rtotal
(11.8)
The bandwidth of the antenna can be simply calculated from the Q factor:
B = f0
Q
(11.9)
The required bandwidth is derived from the bandwidth of the modulation sidebands of the reader
and the load modulation products (if no other procedure is used). As a rule of thumb, the following
can be taken as the bandwidth of an ASK modulated system.
B · T = 1
(11.10)
where T is the turn-on time of the carrier signal, where modulation is used.
For many systems, the optimal Q factor is 10–30. However, it is impossible to generalise here
because, as already mentioned, the Q factor depends upon the required bandwidth and thus upon
the modulation procedure used (e.g. coding, modulation, subcarrier frequency).

Reader Designs
Different types and designs of readers are available for different applications. Readers can be gener-
ally classiﬁed into OEM readers, readers for industrial or portable use and numerous special designs.
11.5.1
OEM Readers
OEM readers are available for integration into customers’ own data capture systems, BDE terminals,
access control systems, till systems, robots, etc. OEM readers are supplied in a shielded tin housing
or as an unhoused board. Electrical connections are in the form of soldered, plug and socket or
screw-on terminals.
11.5.2
Readers for Industrial Use
Industrial readers are available for use in assembly and manufacturing plant. These usually have
a standardised ﬁeld bus interface for simple integration into existing systems. In addition, these
readers fulﬁl various protection types and explosion protected readers (EX) are also available.
11.5.3
Portable Readers
Portable readers are used for the identiﬁcation of animals, as a control device in public transport,
as a terminal for payments, as an aid in servicing and testing, and in the commissioning of systems.

robust and splash-proof devices (IP 54) are available for use in harsh industrial environments.

Near-Field Communication
NFC (near-ﬁeld communication) is a wireless communication technology in the frequency range
of 13.56 MHz. NFC can be used to transmit data between two electronic devices over a distance
of up to 10 cm. NFC is compatible with existing RFID standards and makes it possible both to

read transponders and to simulate transponders (see also Section 3.4). An NFC interface thus
combines in one functional unit the functions of a data transceiver, an RFID reader and an RFID
transponder, and therefore has to include all necessary components, such as transmitter, receiver
and load modulator.
In order to facilitate the integration of an NFC interface into an electronic device, such as a
mobile phones, the industry offers highly integrated NFC transceiver modules (NXP, 2007). The
transceiver modules contain all analogous and digital modules and – similarly to RFID readers -
can thus be activated with simple control commands via the host interface.
Figure 11.29 represents a typical block diagram of an NFC interface. For the active modes
(reader emulation mode, peer-to-peer mode), the RF interface contains a complete transmitter, a

For nonsecure NFC applications, the NFC application (applet) is directly executed in the memory
of the mobile’s application controller
receiver for 13.56 MHz and another receiver for load modulation signals with a modulated 848 kHz
subcarrier (according to ISO/IEC 14443). For the passive mode (card emulation mode), the RF
interface also includes a load modulator.
In the contactless UART (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter), the data are encoded
or decoded into the corresponding signal forms required for the contactless transmission, such as
Manchester encoding.
The communication protocol between NFC interface and other RFID components (reader,
transponder or a second NFC interface) is completely processed in the microprocessor (µPC).
The host control only provides the application data to be transmitted and the control commands.
The application software itsself is stored and executed in the working memory of the electronic
device the NFC device is integrated into. For mobile phones, usually a Java applet realizes
the application software. In its middleware, the application controller (also baseband controller)
of the phone provides the corresponding APIs (application programmer interface) for Java
programming which can be used to access from a Java applet all the phone’s components, such as
display, keyboard, GPRS interface, (U)SIM and also the NFC interface. This kind of application
programming is very common and widely used for games and applications, such as calendars,
routing or blogging clients.
It is very easy to upload new applications via an GSM interface, which today is common practice
for games. This way it is also easy to easily install a large variety of NFC applications.
11.6.1
Secure NFC
Saving and executing Java Applets in the memory of the mobile’s application controller unfor-
tunately also means that the Java applets are not protected against unintentional deletion or the

An NFC secure element can be designed as a directly soldered smart card chip, a secure memory
chip or as the SIM card of a mobile phone
(intentional) manipulation of the data saved in the memory. For safety-insensitive NFC applica-
tions, such as the transmission of pictures between telephones or reading and displaying smart label
data on a poster, this is not an issue. Applications such as contactless payment transactions, e.g.
the contactless creditcard function, with NFC, or for contactless tickets, are a different story. Here,
the unintended change or deletion of data contents can result in the irrecoverable loss of data with
monetary value. In the worst case, it would even be possible to read out data in the phone’s memory
using malicious programmes, such as a manipulated game. The risk should not be underestimated
as the read-out data could be transmitted via a GSM interface to an attacker who may misuse them.
It is therefore strictly forbidden to realize applications for payment transactions that store credit
card data in the unsecured memory range. The same applies to ticketing application with stored
data sets serving as tickets.
A solution to this problem is secure NFC. Here, safety-relevant Java applets and application data
are executed and saved in the memory of a secure element (SE). A large variety of modules can
serve as secure element. An obvious option is using the SIM card that each GSM phone has. Other
options for secure elements are secure memory cards, i.e. memory cards with an additional smart
card chip, or a smart card chip directly soldered into the phone.
Figure 11.31 illustrates the different options for secure NFC. All concepts have in common
that they need an interface between the secure element and the NFC interface as well as between
the application controller and the NFC interface. With an additional interface between the NFC
interface and the application controller it is possible to exclusively use secure element and NFC
interface for secure NFC transactions, such as ticket veriﬁcation at a hub. The corresponding applet
of the application runs in the secure element, i.e. in a secure and trustworthy hardware environment.
The data transmitted via the contactless interface are directly forwarded by the NFC interface to
the secure element and vice versa. The application controller, i.e. the nonsecure part of the system,
is no longer involved in the transaction.
A Java applet in the phone’s application controller assigned to the application serves exclusively
for administrative purposes. For ticketing applications it seems to be feasible that a Java applet is
used for displaying a list with already debited journeys or the residual value of a prepaid ticket

The different design approaches for secure NFC
for multiple journeys. However, it is never possible to carry out actions that are not supported by
the application’s applet in the secure element. Therefore applets and data sets that are saved in
the secure elements cannot be simply read out in order to copy them to another phone. This way,
it is ensured that safety-relevant applications or data cannot be manually deleted by accident or
attacked, or even copied with spyware.
There is a variety of technical options for designing the interface between the secure element
and the NFC interface (GSM Association, 2007). The most promising ones are SWP (single wire
protocol) and NFC-WI (wired interface, also known as S2C interface).
11.6.1.1
Single Wire Protocol
The single wire protocol consists of a single-wire transmission line for connecting an NFC interface
(CLF, contactless front end) as master and a secure element as slave. ETSI SCP in TS 102 613
standardised and adopted this NFC interface (Mohrs, 2008). The single wire protocol is mainly
intended as secure element for (U)SIM cards in mobile phones as there is only one contact of the
standard eight SIM contacts available for this function. The remaining seven contacts are already
allocated to other functions.
The data to be transmitted are represented by the binary states of voltage (S1) and current (S2)
on the single wire. The data transmission from NFC interface to secure element is carried out by
modulating signal S1 through modulation of voltage UCL between the states Logic-1 and Logic-0.
In the reversed direction, the data are transmitted by modulating signal S2 through modulating
current ICL between states Logic-1 and Logic-0. The process of modulating current ICL can also
be described as ‘wire-bound load modulation’. In that case, signal S1 has to be in state Logic-1
(Praca, 2006).
An HDLC protocol is used for controlling data transmission between the NFC interface and the
secure element. The HDLC protocol (high-level data link control) is ISO standardised and is one

The single wire protocol transmits signals S1 and S2 represented by the voltage and current in

of the oldest communication protocols. It implements efﬁcient error detection and correction, sign
synchronization and ‘ﬂow control’.
The protocol for the contactless data transmission between the NFC interface and another con-
tactless device is completely processed by the NFC interface. Only application data are forwarded
to the secure element via the single wire protocol. Both the protocol for contactless data transmis-
sion (ISO/IEC 18092 and ISO/IEC 14443) and a host control interface (HCI) for data transmission
via SWP interface have to be implemented on the NFC interface. Thus the SWP interface is open
to all future, new contactless transmission standards or to the expansion of existing standards and
speciﬁcations of NFC interfaces.
A special case constitutes the wiring of (U)SIM cards as secure elements with an NFC interface
in mobile phones. As shown in Figure 11.36, the voltage (VDD) of the (U)SIM card is not directly
supplied by the phone, but via the NFC interface. This is necessary for contactless data transmission

Example of the wiring of a SIM card as secure element in an NFC interface
with secure elements, even if the battery is ﬂat. If the NFC interface is close to an RFID reader, the
reader ﬁeld supplies NFC interface and secure element with power, similarly to the process used
for passive transponders. This way NFC interface and secure element can, at least, be used in card
emulation mode. Typical ticketing and payment applications using card emulation mode thus have
a high operational security as the contactless functionality does not rely on the battery’s charging
state any longer (Praca, 2006; Mohrs, 2008).
11.6.1.2
NFC Wired Interface
For NFC wired interfaces (NFC-WI, also called S2 C Interface), the secure element is connected
via two wires to the RF interface (modem) of the NFC interface (NFC front end, see Figure 11.29).
Both wires SIGIN (signal-in) and SIGOUT (signal-out) transmit modulation signals between the
NFC interface and the secure element that are digitally received or sent by the RF interface. The
NFC interface provides the secure element only with an analogous receiver and load modulator, and

The modulation signals of the NFC interface are transmitted on the NFC wired interface
therefore only supports operations in card emulation mode. The secure element is a dual-interface
chip that has ports for the NFC-WI; it encodes and decodes the signals as well as processing the
transmission protocol. Externally, the combination of secure element and NFC interface behaves
like a contactless smart card. According to current NFC-WI speciﬁcations, it supports standard
ISO/IEC 14443 Type A, for contactless smart cards, with different bitrates.
At the standard bitrate of 106 kBit/s, the signal SIGOUT represents an AND-link of the reader’s
modiﬁed Miller-encoded data with a 13.56 MHz pulse signal and contains the data stream trans-
mitted by the reader. Figure 9.12 presents an RF signal encoded in this way.
The signal SIGIN directly activates the load modulator in the RF interface of the NFC front end.
At a standard bitrate of 106 kBit/s, SIGIN represent an OR-link of the Manchester-encoded data
stream of the secure element with a subcarrier signal of 848 kHz. Figures 9.12 and 9.13 represent
the corresponding load-modulated RF signal.
For the higher bitrates deﬁned in ISO/IEC 14443, 202 and 404 kBit/s, different signals are used
on the NFC wired interface.
In 2006, ECMA standardized the NFC wired interface with speciﬁcation ECMA-373 (ECMA,
2006).

The Manufacture of Transponders
and Contactless Smart Cards
12.1
Glass and Plastic Transponders
A transponder is made up of two components: the electronic data carrier and the housing.
Figure 12.1 gives a simpliﬁed representation of the manufacturing process for an inductively coupled
transponder.
12.1.1
Chip Manufacture
In accordance with the normal semiconductor manufacturing procedure, the microchip is produced
on a so-called wafer. This is a slice of silicon, which may be 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, upon
which several hundred microchips are produced simultaneously by repeated doping, exposure,
etching and washing of the surface.
In the next stage of production, the microchips on the wafer are contacted using metal points
and then each of the chips is individually tested for functionality. The chips have additional contact
ﬁelds for this purpose, which give direct access – i.e. without going through the RF interface – to
the chip’s memory and security electronics. The chips are placed in so-called test mode during
this procedure, which permits unlimited direct access to all functional groups upon the chip. The
functional test can therefore be performed signiﬁcantly more intensively and comprehensively than
would be possible later on, when communication can only taken place via the contactless technology.
All defective chips are marked with a red ink dot at this stage, so that they can be identiﬁed and
separated out in the subsequent stages of production. The test mode can also be used to programme
a unique serial number into the chip, if the chip has an EEPROM. In read-only transponders, the
serial number is programmed by cutting through predeﬁned connecting lines on the chip using a
laser beam.
After the successful completion of the test programme the test mode is deactivated by perma-
nently breaking certain connections (so-called fuses) on the chip by a strong current surge. This
stage is important to prevent unauthorised reading of data at a later date by the manipulation of the
test contacts on the chip.
After the chips have been tested the wafer is sawn up using a diamond saw to give individual
transponder chips. A single chip in this state is known as a die (plural: dice). A plastic foil is attached

to the reverse of the wafer prior to the sawing operation to prevent the dice from disintegrating
(saw on foil). After the sawing operation the dice can be removed from the plastic foil individually
and ﬁtted into a module.
Usually the dice as such are ﬁtted into glass or plastic transponders. It is also possible to ﬁt
the dice into a chip module. Here the chips are put on a two-piece metal frame and the chip’s
two antenna connections are bonded to one part of the metal frame each. Finally, the dice and
the metal frame are extrusion coated with a moulding substance. This signiﬁcantly increases the
stability of the brittle and extremely breakable silicon dice and mechanically stabilizes the two-
piece metal frame. The metal frame ends sticking out of the moulding substance are used as contact
surfaces. Chip modules are a common component for manufacturing contactless smart cards. (see
also Figure 12.7).
12.1.2
Glass Transponders
The manufacturing process of glass transponders starts with ﬁtting the glass tube sections to a
workpiece carrier. The glass tubes are open at the upper side and are aligned in a matrix for

further processing. The workpiece carriers proceed through all subsequent production steps. The
next operation is to put epoxy resin or silicon material on each glass tube. The resin will later
mechanically ﬁx the chip to the coil ferrite and serve as buffer against impact. The resin hardens
into rubber in order to be able to compensate thermal movements between chip and coil ferrite
without the transponder being damaged. The workpiece carrier ﬁtted with open glass tubes is now
put into a robot in order to manufacture the transponders (Knapich, 2008).
In the robot, the chips are at ﬁrst separated and inserted into a tool holder. A rotary disk is used
to transport the tool holder to the next mounting position where a ferrite core is ﬁtted into the
tool holder in a position that exactly ﬁts the chip. In the tool holder chip and ferrite core are now
precisely ﬁtted to each other.

Due to the rotation of the glass tubes, the glass melts together in a dome shape (Knapich, 2008; reproduced by
permission of : AEG Identiﬁkationssystem GmbH, RFID im Blick)
During the next step, an automatic coiling machine manufactures the transponder coil. Here a
copper wire that is insulated with enamel is wound around the ferrite core and then both protruding
wire ends of the coil are positioned exactly above the two contact surfaces of the chip. Then
thermal compression is used to bond the coil’s wire ends to the chip’s contact surfaces. For glass
transponders, wires have a thickness of only 22 µm. During the same operation, the protruding ends
of the contact wires are removed. Now the electronic unit, i.e. the transponder, is fully functional
and can be contactlessly activated. This step is followed by a contactless function test to sort out
defective transponders. After this test, the fully functional transponders are inserted into the glass
tubes with the chip ﬁrst; here they sink slowly down into the epoxy resin (Knapich, 2008).

The Manufacture of Transponders and Contactless Smart Cards

Finally, the still open end of the glass tube is melted together with a ﬂame or a laser beam.
The glass tubes are rotated through the laser beam; the glass absorbs the light energy of the laser
and starts melting. Due to the rotation of the glass tube, the glass melts together forming a dome
and seals the transponder airtight (Knapich, 2008). As opposed to ﬂames, a laser has a lower heat
impact on the electronics inside the tube. The laser slightly colours the glass in order to be able to
absorb light energy and transform it into heat. Using a ﬂame in the melting process requires that
there is sufﬁcient space above the electronics (Kern, 2005).
The ﬁnal step is a complete electrical and mechanical test of the glass transponders which are
then packaged as bulk goods.
12.1.3
Plastic Transponders
For many applications, transponders are inserted into a plastic housing. Also here, at ﬁrst the
transponder coil is manufactured and electrically bonded to the chip or a chip module. If we do not
use a mechanically stable element such as a ferrite core for the transponder coil, but a cantilever
structure, the copper wire used is coated with low-melting-point baked enamel in addition to the
normal insulating paint. The winding tool is heated to the melting point of the baked enamel during
the winding operation. The enamel melts during winding and hardens rapidly after removing the coil
from the winding tool, causing the individual windings of the transponder coil to stick together. This
guarantees the mechanical stability of the transponder coil during the following stages of assembly.
The semi-ﬁnished transponder is then inserted into a housing using injection moulding (e.g. in
ABS), moulding, gluing or other methods.

12.2
Contactless Smart Cards
Contactless smart cards represent a very common special type of transponder. DIN/ISO 7810
speciﬁes the format for all ID and smart cards. The dimensions of a smart card are speciﬁed
as 85.46 × 53.92 × 0.76 mm (± tolerances). The required thickness of just 0.76 mm represents a
particular challenge for the manufacture of contactless smart cards because this places strict limits
on the possible dimensions of the transponder coil and chip module.
A contactless smart card may, for example, be manufactured from four PVC foils of around
0.2 mm thickness: two inlet foils that are inserted in the inside of the card and two overlay foils
that will form the outside of the card. Contactless smart cards are produced in sheets of 21, 24 or
48. The foils used thus have an area of around 0.1–0.3 m2. The typical foil structure of a contactless
smart card is shown in Figure 12.7. The two overlay foils are printed with the layout of the smart
card. On modern printing machines a high-quality coloured print is possible, such as that familiar
from telephone smart cards.
The antenna in the form of a coil is applied to one of the two inlet foils, the carrier foil, and
connected to the chip module using a suitable connection technique. Four main procedures are used
for the manufacture of the antenna coil: winding, embedding, screen printing and etching.
The carrier foil is covered by a second inlet foil, from which the area of the chip module has been
stamped out. Often a ﬁller is also dosed into the remaining hollow space. This ﬁlling is necessary to
prevent the overlay foils applied after the lamination process (see Section 12.2.3) from collapsing
around the chip module and to give a smooth and even card surface (Haghiri and Tarantino, 1999).
12.2.1
Coil Manufacture
12.2.1.1
Winding Technique
In the winding technique the transponder coil is wound upon a winding tool in the normal way
and afﬁxed using baked enamel. After the chip module has been welded onto the antenna, the
semi-ﬁnished transponder is placed on the inlet sheet and mechanically afﬁxed using cemented
joints (Figure 12.8).
For contactless smart cards in the frequency range <135 kHz the winding technique is the only
procedure that can be used for the manufacture of transponder coils due to the high number of
windings (typically 50–1500).
12.2.1.2
Embedding Technique
Inlet manufacture using the embedding technique (Figures 12.9 and 12.10) is a relatively new
procedure that is nevertheless increasing signiﬁcantly in importance. In this technique, the chip

module is ﬁrst afﬁxed in its intended location on a PVC foil. The wire is then embedded directly
into the foil using a sonotrode. The sonotrode consists of an ultrasonic emitter with a passage in
its head through which the wire is guided onto the foil. The ultrasound emitter is used to locally
heat the wire to such a degree that it melts into the foil and is thus ﬁxed in shape and position. The
sonotrode is moved across the inlet foil in a similar manner to an X–Y plotter, while the wire is
fed through, so that the transponder can be ‘drawn’ or embedded. At the start and the end of the
coil a spot welding machine is used to make the electrical connection to the transponder module.
12.2.1.3
Screen Printing Technique
The screen printing technique is a common printing technique in industrial production and is used,
for example, in the production of wallpaper, (PVC) stickers, signs, and also in textile printing.
A screen mesh made of synthetic or natural ﬁbres or metal wires is stretched over a frame. The
ﬁneness of the screen mesh and the strength of the ﬁbres are selected on the basis of the resolution
of the print and the viscosity of the paint. The template is applied to the screen mesh manually or
photomechanically. The actual print motif, in our case a coil, remains free. The template material
may, for example, be a light-sensitive emulsion that is applied to the screen. If this coated screen

is illuminated through a printing ﬁlm, the emulsion hardens at the illuminated points. The points
that have not been illuminated are washed out with water. Colour drawn over the screen with a
rubber squeegee is pressed through these open points and onto the chosen material. The screen is
raised and the print is complete. All structures have a raster pattern due to the screen mesh. The
elasticity of the screen guarantees extremely high accuracy.
This procedure is used to print a coil of any shape directly onto an inlet foil (see Figure 12.8).
So-called polymer thick ﬁlm pastes (PTF) are used as the ‘printing ink’. These consist of a powder
of conductive material (silver, copper, graphite), a light solvent, and a resin as the ﬁxing agent. After
drying out, a conductive ﬁlm is left behind in the printed shape on the inlet. The surface resistance
RA1 of the ﬁlm is around 5–100 /□1 and falls back to around 50–80% after lamination, since
1 The surface resistance RA of a quadratic conductive layer is dependent only upon the speciﬁc conductivity κ and
the thickness d of the conductive layer and is quoted in /□:
RA =

κ · d = ρ

To determine the conductive track resistance, the surface resistance is multiplied by the ratio of length l to breadth
b of the conductive track:

the effect of heat and pressure during the lamination process increases the partial contact between
the individual grains of the mixed (metal) powder.
Depending upon layer thickness, conductor track width, and number of windings, a typical coil
resistance of 2–75  (smart card with 2–7 windings) can be achieved. Due to the broad conductor
track path (i.e. limited number of windings) this technology is, however, only suitable for frequency
ranges above 8 MHz. Due to cost beneﬁts, printed coils are also used for EAS tags (8 MHz) and
smart labels (13.56 MHz).
12.2.1.4
Etching Technique
The etching technique is the standard procedure used in the electrical industry for the manufacture
of printed circuit boards. Inlet foils for contactless smart cards can also be manufactured using this

procedure. In a special procedure a full-sized copper foil of 35–70 µm thickness is ﬁrst laminated
onto a plastic foil without the use of adhesive. This copper layer is now coated with a light-sensitive
photo-resist, which is dried and then illuminated through a positive ﬁlm. The picture on the positive
ﬁlm is the subsequent form of the coil. In a chemical developing solution the illuminated points
of the photo-resist are washed out, so that copper is once again exposed at these points. In the
subsequent etching bath, all areas that are no longer covered by photo-resist are etched free of
copper, so that ﬁnally only the desired coil form remains. The coil resistance of an etched coil can
easily be calculated from the surface resistance RA (Cu: 500 µ/□where d = 35 µm).
12.2.2
Connection Technique
The different types of antenna also require a different connection technique between the antenna
coil and the transponder chip.
Antenna coils made of wire, i.e. wound or embedded coils, are connected to the chip module
using microwelding techniques. The lacquer enamelled antenna coil is bared in the connection area
of the chip module using a special tool and then welded to the terminals (lead frames) of the chip
module using ultrasound (Haghiri and Tarantino, 1999).
Contacting a printed coil to the chip or a module is problematic as conventional soldering and
welding techniques do not work for polymer pastes. The use of ﬂip chip technology,2 in which

ﬁxing and contacting of the chip can take place using a conductive adhesive, offers a solution. A
second solution is the use of cut clamp technology (CCT). In this approach the metal terminals
(lead frame) of the chip module are punched through with a pointed tool, so that pointed crowns
are formed (Figure 12.12). The chip module is then pressed onto the carrier foil from below, so that
the peaks of the crown penetrate the foil and make contact with the antenna terminals. The crown
peaks are bent over using a ﬂat stamp, making a permanent mechanical and electrical connection
between the chip module and the antenna coils.
Finally, a reﬂow soldering procedure, like the procedure used for ﬁtting components to SMD
printed circuit boards, is available for the connection of an etched coil to a chip module. In order
to prevent short-circuits (between the coil windings) in the vicinity of the chip module as a result
of the soldering process, the coil is ﬁrst printed with a solder resist (typically light green), keeping
the antenna terminals free. A deﬁned quantity of soldering paste is deposited onto these connection
areas by a dispenser. After the chip module has been inserted into a stamped hole on the carrier
foil provided for this purpose and is thus ﬁxed into position, heat is supplied to the terminals of
the chip module by a suitable soldering tool (soldering stamp). This causes the soldering paste to
melt, creating a permanent electrical and mechanical connection between the chip module and the
antenna coil.

Lamination
In the next step, the overlay and inlet foils are assembled and joined together with precision. Finally,
the foils are placed in a laminating machine. By the conduction of heat, the foils are brought into
a soft elastic state at high pressure (approximately 100–150 ◦C). This ‘bakes’ the four sheets to
create a permanent bond.
After the lamination and cooling of the laminated PVC foils, the individual smart cards are
stamped out of the multi-purpose sheet (Figure 12.15). A subsequent functional test ensures the
quality of the cards before these can be sent to the customer.

Example Applications
13.1
Contactless Smart Cards
The ﬁrst plastic cards appeared in the USA as early as the beginning of the 1950s, when cheap PVC
replaced cardboard. In the years that followed, plastic credit cards became widespread. Incidentally,
the ﬁrst credit card was issued by Diners Club in 1950.
The rapid development of semiconductor technology made it possible to integrate data memory
and protective logic onto a single silicon chip in the 1970s. The idea of incorporating such an
integrated memory chip into an identiﬁcation card was patented in 1968 by J¨urgen Dethloff and
Helmut Gr¨otrupp in Germany. However, it was not until almost 15 years later that the great
breakthrough was achieved with the introduction of the telephone smart card by the French company
PTT. Several million telephone smart cards were in circulation in France by 1986 (Rankl and
Efﬁng, 1996). These ﬁrst generation smart cards were memory cards with contacts. A signiﬁcant
improvement was achieved when entire microprocessors were successfully integrated into a silicon
chip, and these chips incorporated into an identiﬁcation card. This made it possible to run software
in a smart card, thus opening up the possibility of realising high-security applications. Thus, smart
cards for mobile telephones and the new bank cards (EC with chip) were realised exclusively using
microprocessor cards.
Since the mid-1980s, repeated attempts have been made to launch contactless smart cards onto
the market. The operating frequency of 135 kHz that was normal at the time and the high power
consumption of the silicon chips on the market necessitated transponder coils with several hun-
dred windings. The resulting large coil cross-section, and the additional capacitors that were often
required, impeded manufacture in the form of ID-1 format plastic cards, and transponders were
usually cast into inconvenient plastic shells. Due to this limitation, contactless smart cards played
a minor role in the smart card market for a long time.
In the ﬁrst half of the 1990s, transponder systems were developed with an operating frequency
of 13.56 MHz. The transponders required for these systems required just ﬁve windings. For the
ﬁrst time it was possible to produce transponder systems in the 0.76- mm-thick ID-1 format. The
great breakthrough in Germany occurred in 1995, with the introduction of the ‘Frequent Traveller’
contactless customer loyalty card in ID-1 format by the German company Lufthansa AG. It was
noteworthy that these cards, manufactured by the Munich company Giesecke & Devrient, still had
a magnetic strip, a hologram and were embossed with the customer number and name.

RFID Handbook
Today, contactless smart cards are divided into three groups based upon the applicable standards
(see also Figure 9.8).
Close coupling smart cards according to ISO/IEC 10536 (see Section 9.2.1). Proximity-coupling
smart cards according to ISO/IEC 14443 (see Section 9.2.2) as well as vicinity-coupling smart cards
according to ISO/IEC 15693 (see Section 9.2.3). These three types have been developed explicitly
for contactless smart cards and their typical applications. In addition, it is possible to produce any
other RFID standard as a contactless smart card. Mainly LF and UHF transponders are available
as contactless smart cards.
Proximity-coupled cards according to ISO/IEC 14443 have by far the largest market share as
several millions are used for ticketing and payment systems. A large part of proximity-coupling
smart cards are currently still memory cards (see Section 10.1.3), but also microprocessor cards
available since 1997 (Section 10.2) are increasing their market share as they combine large ﬂexibility
in the application design with high data security.
As opposed to this, the above-mentioned contactless smart cards in the LF or UHF range are used
to a lesser extent, even though UHF smart cards, above all, (e.g. according to ISO/IEC 18000-6)
have reading ranges of several metres.
Close-coupling smart cards are being faded out as their production is very costly due to the
required capacitive coupling area required in connection with two antenna coils. And close-coupling
smart cards do not even have any handling advantages compared with traditional smart cards with
contacts as they also have to be inserted into a reader in order to be read out.
13.2
Public Transport
Public transport is one of the applications where the greatest potential exists for the use of RFID
systems, particularly contactless smart cards. In Europe and the USA trafﬁc associations are still
operating at a huge loss, sometimes as much as 40% of turnover (Czako, 1997), which must be
made up by subsidies from the community and country in question. Due to the increasing shortage
of resources, long-term solutions must be sought that will cut these losses by reducing costs and
increasing income. The use of contactless smart cards as electronic travel passes could make an
important contribution to improving the situation (AFC = automatic fare collection). In the ﬁeld
of fare management in particular there is a great deal of room for improvement.
13.2.1
The Starting Point
The unhealthy ﬁnancial situation of transport companies naturally has many different causes. How-
ever, the following factors are worth mentioning in connection with electronic travel passes:
• Transport companies incur high costs through the sale of travel passes by automatic dispensers.
For example, the sale of a travel pass through an automatic dispenser in Z¨urich costs CHF 0.45,
where the average sales price is CHF 2.80 (Czako, 1997). Thus, 16% of the sales price is lost
from the outset by the provision of the dispenser, maintenance and repairs alone (ﬁlling with
notes and coins, repairs, damage by vandalism).
• In vehicles, too, expensive electronic ticket printers or mobile devices are required. Sometimes
the tickets are even sold by the driver, which causes long waiting times while passengers board,
plus the additional security risk presented by the continuous distraction of the driver.
• Paper tickets are thrown away after use, although the manufacture of fraud-proof tickets for
transport companies is becoming more and more expensive.

Example Applications
363
• In German cities in particular, losses of up to 25% must be taken into account due to fare-
dodgers (Czako, 1997). This is because German transport companies have very liberal travelling
conditions and permit entry to the underground system and buses without travel passes ﬁrst being
checked.
• Association discounts can only be calculated on the basis of costly random counts, which leads
to imprecision in the calculation.
13.2.2
Requirements
Electronic fare management systems have to fulﬁl very high expectations and requirements, par-
ticularly with regard to resistance to degradation and wear, write and read speed and ease of use.
These expectations can only be satisfactorily fulﬁlled by RFID systems. The most common format
for contactless smart cards is the ID-1 format and, recently, wrist watches.
13.2.2.1
Transaction Time
The time taken for the purchase or veriﬁcation of a travel pass is particularly critical in transport
systems in which the pass can only be checked inside the vehicle. This is a particular problem in
buses and trams. In the underground railway, passes can be checked at a turnstile, or by conductors.
A comparison of different methods (Table 13.1) shows the clear superiority of RFID systems in
terms of transaction times.
13.2.2.2
Resistance to Degradation, Lifetime, Convenience
• Contactless smart cards are designed for a lifetime of 10 years. Rain, cold, dirt and dust are not
a problem for either smart card or reader.
• Contactless smart cards can be kept in a briefcase or handbag and are therefore extremely
convenient to use. Transponders can also be ﬁtted into wrist watches.
13.2.3
Beneﬁts of RFID Systems
The replacement of conventional paper tickets by a modern electronic fare management system
based on contactless smart cards provides a multitude of beneﬁts to all those involved. Although

systems is demonstrated by the following beneﬁts for users and operators of public transport
companies.
Beneﬁts for passengers
• Cash is no longer necessary, contactless smart cards can be loaded with large amounts of money,
passengers no longer need to carry the correct change.
• Prepaid contactless smart cards remain valid even if fares are changed.
• The passenger no longer needs to know the precise fare; the system automatically deducts the
correct fare from the card.
• Monthly tickets can begin on any day of the month. The period of validity begins after the ﬁrst
deduction from the contactless card.
Beneﬁts for the driver
• Passes are no longer sold, resulting in less distraction of driving staff.
• No cash in vehicle.
• Elimination of the daily income calculation.
Beneﬁts for the transport company
• Reduction in operating and maintenance costs of sales dispensers and ticket devaluers.
• Very secure against vandalism (e.g. the use of chewing gum to sabotage an electronic device).
• It is easy to change fares; no new tickets need to be printed.

Example Applications
365
• The introduction of a closed (electronic) system, in which all passengers must produce a valid
travel pass, can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of fare-dodgers.
Beneﬁts for the transport association
• It is possible to calculate the performance of individual partners in the association. Because
precise data is obtained automatically in electronic fare management systems, the discount for
the association can be calculated using precise ﬁgures.
• Expressive statistical data is obtained.
Beneﬁts for the treasury
• Reduction of the need for subsidies due to cost reductions.
• Better use of public transport due to the improved service has a positive effect on takings and
on the environment.
13.2.4
Fare Systems using Electronic Payment
Transport association regions are often divided into different fare zones and payment zones. There
are also different types of travel pass, time zones and numerous possible combinations. The cal-
culation of the fare can therefore be extremely complicated in conventional payment systems and
can even be a source of bewilderment to local customers.
Electronic fare management systems, on the other hand, facilitate the use of completely new
procedures for the calculation and payment of fares. There are four basic models for electronic fare
calculation, as shown in Table 13.2.
Table 13.2
Different fare systems for payment with contactless smart card
Fare system 1
Payment takes place at the beginning of the journey. A ﬁxed amount is
deducted from the contactless smart card, regardless of the distance
travelled
Fare system 2
At the beginning of the journey the entry point (check-in) is recorded on the
contactless card. Upon disembarking at the ﬁnal station (check-out), the
fare for the distance travelled is automatically calculated and deducted
from the card. In addition, the card can be checked at each change-over
point for the existence of a valid ‘check-in’ entry. To foil attempts at
manipulation, the lack of a ‘check-out’ record can be penalised by the
deduction of the maximum fare at the beginning of the next journey
Fare system 3
This model is best suited for interlinked networks, in which the same route
can be travelled using different transport systems at different fares. Every
time the passenger changes vehicles a predetermined amount is deducted
from the card, bonus fares for long-distance travellers and people who
change several times can be automatically taken into account (see
Figure 13.4)
Best price calculation
In this system all journeys made are recorded on the contactless card for a
month. If a certain number of journeys was exceeded on one day or in the
month as a whole, then the contactless card can automatically be converted
into a cheaper 24-hour or monthly card. This gives the customer maximum
ﬂexibility and the best possible fares. Best price calculation improves
customer relations and makes a big contribution to customer satisfaction

Market Potential
It is estimated that around 50% of all contactless cards sold are used in the public transport sector
(Hamann, 1997). The biggest areas of use are the large population centres in Asia (Seoul, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Shanghai), and European cities (Paris, London, Berlin). In 1994 and 1995 around 1
million contactless smart cards were produced per year worldwide for public transport applications.
In the period 1996 to 1997 the volume rose to over 40 million cards per year (Droschl, 1997).
The expected volume for 1998 alone is around 100 million contactless smart cards worldwide for
public transport applications (Hamann, 1997). Given annual growth rates of 60% or more, we can
expect the annual demand for contactless smart cards to have risen to 250 million by the turn of
the century.
The highest growth rates for contactless smart cards in public transport applications will be in the
Asia-Paciﬁc area, because of the new infrastructures being created here using the latest technologies
(Droschl, 1997).

Example Projects
13.2.6.1
Korea – Seoul
The largest electronic travel pass system (AFC) yet to use contactless cards was commissioned at
the start of 1996 in the metropolis of Seoul, South Korea (see Figures 13.5–13.7). The Korean
‘Bus Card’ is a prepaid card, issued with a basic value of 20 000 Won (¤17). Fares are calculated
according to fare system 1. A bus journey costs an average of 400 Won (¤0.35), but every time
the passenger changes vehicles they must pay again.
The card can be used on all 453 lines and recharged at identiﬁed kiosks as required. The transport
association, Seoul Bus Union, is made up of 89 individual operator companies with a total of over
8700 buses, which were all equipped with contactless terminals by the middle of 1996. When the
Kyung-Ki province that surrounds the capital city was included in the scheme, a further 4000 buses
and a total of 3500 charging points were ﬁtted with terminals by 1997 (Droschl, 1997). The RFID

technology used in this project is the MIFAREsystem (inductively coupled, 10 cm, 13.56 MHz),
which is very popular in public transport applications.
It is predicted that four million Bus Cards will be in circulation by the end of 1997. The huge
success of this system has convinced the government of Seoul to introduce a compatible system
for the underground railway system.
13.2.6.2
Germany – L¨uneburg, Oldenburg
One of the ﬁrst smart card projects in Germany’s public transport system is the Fahrsmart project
in the KVG L¨uneburg – VWG Oldenburg transport association. The subsidised Fahrsmart pilot
project was launched by the Ministry for Education and Research in this area as early as 1990/91.
Around 20 000 smart cards with contacts were issued to customers for this project. However, sig-
niﬁcant ﬂaws in the installed systems became evident during this pilot project; the biggest problem
was that the registration time of over three seconds per passenger was considered to be excessive.

368

At the beginning of 1995 a new ﬁeld test was launched, the Fahrsmart II system based upon con-
tactless smart cards. The RFID technology used was the MIFAREsystem by Philips/Mikron. Sys-
tem integration, i.e. the commissioning of the entire system, was performed by Siemens VT (Berlin).
The Fahrsmart system automatically calculates the cheapest price for the customer (best price
guarantee). The passenger must check in at the start of the journey using their personal smart card
and check out at the end of the journey. The journey data obtained are collected in the on-board
computer and stored on the smart card for veriﬁcation.
When the vehicle returns to the depot at the end of the day the current day’s data is sent from
the vehicle computer to the station server via an infrared interface (Figure 13.6). The processed
data is then transferred to the central Fahrsmart server via an internal network. To calculate the
monthly invoice, the Fahrsmart server analyses the usage proﬁle of each individual passenger and
calculates the cheapest ticket for the distance travelled (individual journey, weekly pass, monthly
pass etc.).
13.2.6.3
EU Projects – ICARE and CALYPSO
Some of the above-mentioned local transport projects using contactless smart cards, like almost
all projects realised to date, are so-called closed exchange systems. In practice this means that the
smart cards are ‘charged up’ with money, but can only be used within the public transport system
in question as a ticket or means of payment for small amounts – for example in the operating

company’s drinks machines. They cannot be used in other shops or even as an electronic travel
pass in other towns. This means that the card holder has to store money for a speciﬁc application
in the electronic purse of each closed system and no longer has direct access to this for a differ-
ent application, e.g. telephone smart card, contactless travel pass, prepaid card for the company
restaurant (Lorenz, 1998b). This is the result of the card technology used, since the cards that have
predominated up until now have only a memory chip and thus do not satisfy the strict security
requirements of the credit institutes for open automated ﬁnancial exchange systems.

370
RFID Handbook
Open ﬁnancial exchange systems based upon a microprocessor chip have already been success-
fully introduced in the ﬁeld of contact smart cards. In Germany these systems are the Paycard from
Telekom, the VISA-Cash-Karte, and the ‘ec-Karte mit Chip’, the latter having the greatest customer
base with approximately 50–55 million cards in use. These cards were designed for payments of
small sums and can be used everywhere that suitable readers are available. From the point of view
of the user, it would be ideal if the cash card could be used as a ticket for local public transport.
Due to the high transaction times of contact smart cards (see Section 13.2.2.1) electronic cash
cards have also not yet been able to establish themselves as an electronic travel pass in local public
transport applications.
Various solutions have been proposed that aim to combine the user-friendliness of contactless
tickets with the security of contact exchange systems, and thus improve the acceptance of such
systems by customers (Lorenz, 1998b).
The hybrid card is the combination of a contactless smart card with an additional contact chip on
one card. There is, however, no electrical connection between the two chips. This means that it must
be possible to transfer sums of money from one chip to the other – for example in special machines.
Due to this limitation, the hybrid card too can only be considered as a provisional solution.
The dual interface card (or Combicard, see Section 10.2.1) resulted from the combination of
a contact and a contactless interface on a single card chip. This is actually the ideal solution for
the combination of an electronic travel pass with an open ﬁnancial exchange system. However, the
question of when the electronic purse of the German ZKA (ec-card) will be available as a dual
interface card, and what quantities will exist, must remain unanswered for the present. However,
VISA has already announced that it will integrate its VISA cash chip, previously based upon contact
technology, into a combichip in Madrid.
The envelope solution, in which a contactless ‘adapter’ turns the contact smart card into a
contactless pass, offers the advantage over the above-mentioned variants that the microprocessor
smart cards already in circulation can be made usable as contactless cards without changing the
cards themselves.
The envelope solution is central to ICARE (‘Integration of contactless technologies into public
transport environment’). This EU-supported project is oriented towards the use of open electronic
exchange systems in local public transport systems (Lorenz, 1998a). The ﬁeld trials for this project,
which was started as early as 1996, will be performed in various European regions.
In Paris, the largest European conurbation, 40 000 RATP staff and 4000 passengers have already
been equipped with an envelope. As an additional feature, an emergency call feature has been
developed that is currently being tested in the Metro. This feature can be triggered by means of
the envelope. In addition to the envelope concept, the development of a disposable ticket was also
given some priority in Paris.
In Venice, a town with a high proportion of day trippers, several landing stages have been ﬁtted
with contactless readers. In addition to the contactless ticket function, a central feature in Venice
is the multi-functionality of the concept. The card can be used in museums, hotels, or as a car
park ticket.
In the district of Constance on Lake Constance, after an initial ﬁeld trial in Autumn 1996, a
second ﬁeld trial was initiated in January 1998. In this second trial the cashcard of the local savings
bank is used in conjunction with an envelope to form the ‘FlexPass’ (Lorenz, 1998b), which can be
used in local transport (see Figure 13.8). A hands-free antenna with a range of 1 m allows statistical
data on card use to be recorded without the customer having to hold the envelope near to the reader.
In Lisbon, a medium-sized European capital city with a complex local public transport system
and numerous public and private operating companies, the development of a hands-free antenna
was also central to the project.
Since 1998, research activities have been continued under the EU CALYPSO project (contact and
contactless environments yielding a citizen pass integrating urban services and ﬁnancial operations).
Transport companies have increased their efforts to build up a partnership with the operators

of automated exchange systems. Among other companies from the German credit industry, the
Deutsche Sparkassen- und Giroverband (DSGV) has been recruited as a partner (Amp´elas, 1998;
Lorenz, 1998c).
The objective of the CALYPSO project is the ‘FlexPass’. The intention is that this will replace
both the paper ticket and the cash used by the customer for payment. A new aspect of the project is
the introduction of further services on the envelope, for example a dynamic passenger information
service, i.e. departure times and connections are shown on the display. Use in car parks or the
integration of (emergency) call services is also being considered.
In the long term, the inclusion of further applications in the ﬁelds of parking, tourism, public
administration, or even car-sharing on the FlexPass is planned (Lorenz, 1998c).
13.3
Contactless Payment Systems
From the outset of RFID technology, contactless smart cards and transponders have been used for
paying for goods and services. The different systems distinguish between closed and open payment
systems.
A closed payment system is a system that only works within the operational range of a speciﬁc
provider and can only be used for purchasing goods or services from this particular provider.
Typical examples are contactless smart cards in university refectories, company canteens or RFID
wristbands in swimming pools that are used to pay for food purchased in the snack bar. These are
mainly prepaid systems, which means that the card has to be loaded at a loading terminal with
cash that is credited to the smart card and is then debited at the provider’s cash desk. As closed
systems are tailored to the needs of the system provider, a large variety of RFID standards and
data structures are used.
As opposed to this, open payment systems are systems that use contactless smart cards instead of
cash. Open payment systems are based on national or global standards such as EMV speciﬁcations
(EMV – Europay, Mastercard, Visa) and are nationally and even internationally available. The use
of contactless smart cards does in principle not differ from that of magnetic or chip cards. The
main difference is the interface between card and terminal, i.e. the physical procedure that the
terminal uses to read out credit card data. Usually, in payment systems contactless smart cards
apply standard ISO/IEC 14443 for data transmission. Regarding commands and data elements sent
by the terminal, EMV speciﬁcations apply. These are usually reduced to the required minimum in
order to achieve short transaction times. According to current standards, the card does not have
to be placed more than 200 ms in front of the reader, more complex issues may even take up
to 500 ms. The card holder must have the impression that the contactless card allows a very fast
payment (Johne, 2008). In favour of extremely short transaction times, contactless payment systems
often work with the authentiﬁcation of the card holder, which usually requires entering a PIN or
signing a payment receipt.
For open payment systems, the point-of-sale (POS) often is the point where the customer pays
for goods or services. This can be the cash desk in a supermarket, but also the tax ofﬁce at a
townhall or an automatic fuelling terminal working with bank cards. The technical device used is
a POS terminal that reads the data of a contactless smart card, veriﬁes the card data and forwards
the data for payment transaction to a bank background system.
A closer look shows how the different components interact. The customer as a card holder
receives a credit or debit card from his or her bank. The bank also issues the card and establishes
the connection to the card holder’s account. The bank, in turn, is supported by a superordinated
payment system, such as MasterCard or Visa.
On the other side, a retailer who wants to offer a contactless payment option to his or her
customers operates a POS terminal. This is a speciﬁc contactless reader which is equipped with
security electronics and connected online via a communication network, such as ISDN, Datex

connections, IP networks and sometimes even analogue connections, to the retailer bank. Common
international usage denominates the retailer bank as acquirer and the customer’s bank issuing the
card as issuer. The aquirer as the ﬁnance service provider for the afﬁliated retailers operates its
own data-processing centre for payment transactions with a large number of POS terminals that are
connected to it online (Johne, 2008).
During payment transactions, the POS terminal sends – after a plausibility check of the card
data – a data set to the acquirer. In addition to the purchase price, the data set contains the customer’s
card data, such as card number or validity date. The acquirer now requests the customer’s bank, i.e.
the issuer, to decide whether the card may be accepted or not. The acquirer sends a request to the
superordinated payment system (e.g. MasterCard or Visa) which, in turn, establishes a connection to
the issuer. The issuer decides, based on the received card data, whether the transaction may be car-
ried out and authorizes the process by providing the acquirer with a response for the POS terminal1.
At the end of this process, the card will be accepted or declined by the terminal (Johne, 2008).
After authorizing a transaction (online or ofﬂine), from a customer’s perspective the payment
process is ﬁnished. For credit card payments, he or she only has to sign a voucher and gets the
receipt. At the end of the day, the retailer balances the cash account at the POS terminal. At ﬁrst
all saved ofﬂine transaction data sets as well as a totals record – usually split according to payment
systems – is transmitted to the acquirer. This totals record requests the acquirer to send via the
network of the respective payment systems a message to the issuer to credit the authorizations

veriﬁcation from the terminal to the issuer.

made during the day. This will prompt the issuer to debit the corresponding customer account and
credit the amount for payment to the acquirer and subsequently to the individual retailer2.
Regarding the processes between terminal and background system, the payment procedures
described are identical for all card types – magnetic-striped, contact or contactless smart cards.
There are clear differences, though, for the handling between terminal and the card itself. In the
case of magnetic stripes, only a limited amount of data is read out. For smart cards, terminal
and card communicate in a very complex way, reading out a large amount of data from the card
and verifying it at the terminal. Using cryptographic methods such as RSA, it is even possible to
determine the authenticity of the card and the issuer and thus prevent cards from being copied.
EMV speciﬁcations deﬁne a corresponding method.
Already in 2003, the global credit card organizations American Express, MasterCardand
Visastarted offering to issuers, acquirers and retailers ﬁrst ﬁeld trials for contactless payment.
Since 2005, the positive customer and retailer response has led to a wide introduction of contactless
smart cards in open payment systems. The credit card organizations use one and the same standards.
This way the terminal is able to easily read cards of different organizations.
Contactless credit cards and POS terminals communicating according to ISO/IEC 14442 at
13.56 MHz and corresponding to the common EMV standard can be recognized by the printed
wave symbol

13.3.1
MasterCard
In 2003, MasterCard started the ﬁeld trials of the contactless PayPass project in the US; and in
2005 regular operation began. Classical issuers, such as Chase, Citibank or MBNA issue contactless
credit cards to customers. The physical interface is ISO/IEC 14443-speciﬁed (Vivotech, 2006). The
cards continue to have the classical magnetic stripe.
13.3.2
ExpressPay by American Express
In 2005 American Express introduced in the US its contactless payment system ExpressPay.
ExpressPay transponders are available in different designs, for instance as contactless credit cards
with magnetic stripes and holograms or as also as a practical keyring pendant. By calculating a
digital signature via the transaction data on a card, ExpressPay offers more security against attacks
and forgery. The cards’ physical interface is ISO/IEC 14443-speciﬁed (Vivotech, 2006).
13.3.3
VisaContactless
In 2006, Visa introduced in Asia a contactless payment system Visa Wave. In Asia, all contactless
credit cards are equipped with dual-interface chips and thus can be activated both with and without
contact (Vivotech, 2006). The card’s physical interface complies with speciﬁcations ISO/IEC 14443
and ISO/IEC 7816 (contact interface). Both classical credit cards as well as debit cards and pre-paid
cards are issued.
2 It depends on card type (credit card or debit card), at what exact time the customer card account will be debited.
Debit cards usually prompt immediate cash ﬂow (even called ‘pay now’). For credit card payments, the customer
account often is debited at a later time, once a month, for instance.

Example Applications

13.3.4
ExxonMobil Speedpass
As early as 1997, Mobile Oil Corp. (later ExxonMobil) introduced Speedpass in the US in order to
facilitate payments at service stations. Speedpass is a 125 kHz transponder which is available as a
small keyring pendant or integrated into a wrist watch. The reader is located directly in the petrol
pump at the service station. The transponder itself does not contain any credit card information,
but only a unique customer identiﬁcation as well as a cryptographic code. Customers’ bank details
are all lodged in the background system of the Speedpass system and thus cannot be spied out
(Vivotech, 2006). To pay the petrol bill, you simply hold the transponder against the correspondingly
marked position at the pump.
Already in 2006, more than 6 million customers used Speedpass transponders at over 8500 petrol
stations in the United States.
As Speedpass transponders have a different physical interface, they cannot be read by contactless
POS readers (13.56 MHz, ISO/IEC 14443) and do not comply with EMV standards. Vice versa, a
Speedpass reader cannot communicate with EMV compatible contactless credit cards.
13.4
NFC Applications
In 2002, the two companies NXP Semiconductors (then still Philips’ semiconductor operation) and
Sony began to jointly develop a new RFID technology, near-ﬁeld communication (NFC). NFC pro-
vides a technology that makes it possible simply to add a very ﬂexible RFID interface to electronic
devices (see Section 11.6). NFC supports different operational modes, active mode and passive
mode (see Section 3.4). An NFC device can behave externally both as a contactless smart card
(card emulation) and as a reader (reader emulation) or it can even realise a data link between NFC
devices (peer-to-peer). NFC is speciﬁed according to standards ISO/IEC 18092 NFCIP-1 (ECMA
340) and ISO/IEC 21481 NFCIP-2 (ECMA 352) (Philips Semiconductors, 2006). In addition, NFC
is compatible with MIFARE, a common NXP contactless smart card technology, and with FELICIA,
Sony’s contactless smart card system (Grassie, 2007) as well as with all ISO/IEC 14443-A-speciﬁed
transponders and readers.
NFC application can be divided into different categories (Peleschka, 2006):
• Touch and Go:
in this category we ﬁnd applications such as access control systems, logistics
reporting systems or security technology as well as ticketing systems. Here the NFC device
behaves like a contactless smart card that contains an access code or ticket and has only to move
quickly past the reader.
• Touch and Conﬁrm:
applications such as mobile payment where the user has to conﬁrm the
interaction by pressing a button or entering a PIN into the NFC device.

376
RFID Handbook
• Touch and Capture: here, the NFC device is located close to the transponder (smart label) which
for instance can be attached to a smart poster. The NFC device can read out transponders for
information such as phone numbers or a URL for further information.
• Touch and Link:
applications that require an online connection of the NFC device. Data read
by the NFC interface are forwarded via an online connection (GPRS, UMTS) to a server. The
server can process these data and send back information to the NFC device where it is shown
on the display.
• Touch and Connect:
a connection of two NFC devices for transmitting images, MP3 ﬁles or
simply for matching phone directories of two NFC-enabled mobile phones.
• Touch and Explore: it is possible to randomly combine the above categories. Touch and Explore
allows the user to intuitively ‘ﬁnd and explore’ new applications (Peleschka, 2006).
There are clear signs that in the future the mobile phone will be the personal NFC device. As
most people carry their mobile phones on them all the time there is a valuable additional beneﬁt
if everyday services can be provided through an NFC-enabled mobile phone. Starting in 2005,
throughout the world NFC applications are being introduced.
NFC devices are most easily used in applications that already dispense with of a reader infras-
tructure. Therefore, contactless smart cards of a public transportation ticket application can be easily
replaced by NFC-enabled mobile phones. The phone’s NFC interface takes on the function of the
contactless smart card, with the ticket data sets being safely stored in a secure element.
However, the special advantage of mobile phones is that, via the GSM interface, new additional
functions and services can be offered that may lead to novel business models. OTA services (OTA =
over the air) can administer data in the secure element of an NFC-enabled phone. OTA services
make use of the mobile’s option to transmit data via GPRS or UMTS. Using OTA services ensures
secrecy of personalization data due to strong encryption and authentiﬁcation (Johne, 2008). This
way it is possible for public transportation businesses to use OTA services to automatically send
customers an electronic monthly season ticket at the beginning of the month which the customer
can save in his or her NFC phone. Even a single ticket that was ordered with the Internet browser

NFC-enabled mobile phones could even be used to implement applications that are problematic
regarding the installation and networking of the readers (e.g. in vehicles) or that are too expensive (if
the target is nationwide coverage, for instance). Here, the stationary reader and portable transponder
simply switch their traditional roles. This is the case of the project Touch and Travel introduced in
2005 by Deutsche Bahn AG where NFC-enabled mobile phones can be used as tickets for long-
distance travel. Railway stations that are part of the Touch and Travel network only need to be
equipped with passive transponders (ISO/IEC 14443) that are located in eye-catching ‘touchpoints’.
To buy a valid ticket, the previously registered customer starts a speciﬁc application – the Touch
and Travel applet – on an NFC-enabled mobile phone immediately prior to the journey and moves
the phone into the reading range of the touchpoint transponder. The Touch and Travel applet now
builds an online connection via mobile phone to a Deutsche Bahn data centre, transmits the data
read out of the transponder to a server and writes some of the data received by the server into the
mobile phone’s secure element. This way the customer is booked into the system and the railway
station where the touchpoint was read is entered as departure station of the forthcoming journey
(Spitz, 2007).
The booking data set entered into the secure element now constitutes a valid ticket and can be
easily veriﬁed by the conductor with a portable reader. At the end of the journey, the customer
simply goes to the nearest touchpoint and repeats the reading procedure. This way, the customer
checks out of the system, the journey is registered as ended and the corresponding price is calculated
(Spitz, 2007).
Even for payment transactions, the use of NFC phones opens up completely new opportunities.
An NFC mobile phone that is used for payment simulates contactless credit or debit cards (card
emulation mode). The POS terminal cannot distinguish whether the card holder uses a contactless
card or an NFC phone with the corresponding payment application. The advantage is obvious: If the
POS terminal includes a contactless reader NFC technology can be accepted for payment without
any additional efforts. This does not affect the processing of the payment with NFC phones as the
existing infrastructure (see Section 13.3) can be used.

This way, NFC phones have turned into credit or debit cards. They can be easily used for
payment transactions. Even if the battery is empty, NFC phones can still be used for paying as the
POS terminal contactlessly provides the necessary power to the NFC chip.
Differences become obvious when the ‘credit card in the phone’ supports additional functions
that traditional cards do not have. An NFC-enabled phone is, strictly speaking, a highly complex

380
RFID Handbook
IT system and can store several card data sets in the secure element (see Section 11.6.1), i.e. also
several credit and debit cards of different payment systems. During the payment process, the ‘card
holder’ (i.e. the phone user) only has to select a preferred card or has the option to previously
make this selection with a special menu entry in the NFC phone. Other possible functions include
the temporary inactivation of the card; for instance, if you lend the phone to somebody else who
is not supposed to use the stored credit cards (Johne, 2008).
OTA services can be used to personalize the secure element with personal credit card data and
extend an existing expired card. If the owner of an NFC-enabled phone registers the phone as lost
and wants to remotely inactivate the card functions he or she can easily use OTA services to do so.
13.5
Electronic Passport
Since November 2005, Germany has issued electronic passports, the ePass. Thus Germany
is, together with several other countries, one of the forerunners regarding the Europe-wide
introduction of ePassports based on EU Directive 2252/2004 (Amtsblatt der Europ¨aischen Union,
2004) which had to be implemented by all 24 EU member states by August 2006 (Seidel,
2005). Also outside the EU, several countries, such as Japan, Singapore and the US, are about to
introduce electronic passports. These passports are marked as electronic passports with a stilisied
chip
on the outside cover.
The ePassport itself consists of a contactless microprocessor chip that – together with the
antenna – is laminated into the passport data page or integrated into the passport cover (see
Figure 13.19). The purpose of the contactless microchip is to improve passport security against
forgery. In 2002, i.e. prior to the introduction of ePassports, 290 completely forged passports were
detected. The content of another 394 passports was forged (Sietmann, 2005).
The ﬁrst stage of EU ePassports deﬁnes that the RFID chip stores as person-related data the
name, date of birth, as well as gender, and as a biometric feature a photograph of the passport

holder. As a second stage, the RFID chip of EU passports stores another biometric feature, the
ﬁngerprint of the passport holder. By 2008, all airports and boarder controls had to be equipped
with readers for the new ePassports.
The technical speciﬁcations of the biometric passport follow the recommendations of the New
Technologies Working Group (NTWG) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
Germany is represented in the Board by the Federal Ministry for Internal Affairs (BMI ) and techni-
cally supported by the Federal Criminal Police Ofﬁce (BKA) and the Federal Ofﬁce for Information
Security (BSI , http.//www.bsi.bund.de). Speciﬁcations are publicly available via the ICAO website
(http://icao.org/mrtd). During border controls, readers and passports of different countries have to
be compatible; otherwise it will not be possible to achieve the intended international interoperabil-
ity of ePassport readability in international cross-border trafﬁc. For this reason, the ICAO initially
deﬁned only minimum requirements for biometric passports. Internationally, only the photograph
of the face is compulsory as a biometrical feature for all countries (Bundesministerium des Innern,
n.d.). Since 2008 EU ePassports have included the passport holder’s ﬁngerprints.
An important part of ICAO speciﬁcations are the contactless interface and the data organization
on the RFID chip. The contactless interface of ePassports complies with standard ISO/IEC 14443.
The rated reading range of an ePassport is 10 cm. In order to achieve short reading times data
transmission between ePassport and reader should support, in addition to the default bitrate of 106
kBit/s, also higher bitrates of up to 848 kBit/s according to ISO/IEC 14443. For the ePassports
issued in Germany, the serial number required for the anticollision algorithm according to ISO/IEC
14443 is generated on a random basis in order to prevent the tracking of ePassports, which would
be possible with ﬁxed and obvious serial numbers.

Figure 13.20
Data organisation in the contactless chip of ePassports
Figure 13.20 shows the data organization on the contactless chip. Data group 1 (DG1) saves all
data that is printed on the machine-readable zone (MRZ) of the passport’s data page. Data group 2
(DG2) stores a digital copy of the passport photograph in JPEG2000 format. The ﬁnger prints of
the passport holder are to be saved in data group 3 (DG3), also as an image. The other data groups
are optional and are currently not being used.
A minimum memory of 32 kByte EEPROM is necessary to be able to save all required data
on the chip. German ePassports use the following two contactless microprocessors: Inﬁneon SLE
66CLX641P (64 kByte) and Philips Smart MX P5CT072 (72 kByte) (CCC, 2005).
Integrity and authenticity of the data stored on the RFID chip is secured by a digital signa-
ture. This way it is possible to detect false or manipulated data. Authorized entities, e.g. printing
companies, that also produce the physical documents use a secret code for signing the electronic
documents. A public code – which in turn has to be certiﬁed by the country signing certiﬁcation
authority of the issuing country – is used to verify the electronic documents (BSI, 2005).
As long as the ePassport is closed the data on the contactless chip should be protected against
unauthorized read access. If the ePassport is handed over to a border-control ofﬁcial, it should
be possible to read it, though. The ePass should therefore emulate the characteristics of current

passports. Basic access control (BAC) technically implements this behaviour in order for the reader
to actually have optical access to the passport’s data pages.
If the ePassport is put on a reader, at ﬁrst it optically reads the data of the machine-readable zone
(MRZ). The MRZ ﬁelds, which are secured against reading errors by a check digit, i.e. passport
number, the passport holder’s date of birth and the date of expiry of the passport, are used to
calculate access code k (see Figure 13.21). This code initiates the mutual authentication of reader
and ePassport. The successful completion of this process is a prerequisite for reading the data
groups (BSI, 2005).
13.6
Ski Tickets
Anyone entering a ski lift has to be in possession of a valid daily or weekly pass. These tickets were
originally made of cardboard and validated by a date stamp. Checking paper tickets is very labour
intensive because each ticket must be checked visually for validity. Furthermore, it is inconvenient
for individual skiers to have to ﬁsh around in their anoraks with cold ﬁngers for a sodden paper
ticket before every journey on the lift.
RFID technology offers an ideal alternative by replacing paper tickets with contactless smart
cards or disk transponders (Figure 13.22). When the transponder is sold a deposit of ¤5–10 is
usually retained. After use, the transponder can be returned and the deposit refunded. The lift
operator can revalue the transponder using special readers and it can thus be reused.
The read range of the system is designed to be great enough that the transponder tickets no
longer need to be held in the hand, but can remain in an anorak pocket.
All ski lift entrances are protected by a turnstile, which is released by the read electronics upon
detection of a valid transponder. In order to read the skier’s transponder, however it is carried,
every entrance is monitored by two antennas opposite each other.
The size of the magnetic antenna is a problem, because it must be very large due to the desired
read range. The resulting magnetic coupling between the two reader antennas is so great at a distance
of several metres that the resulting mutual interference makes it impossible to read a transponder.
To circumvent this problem, ski ticket systems activate only one reader at a time, while the RF
ﬁeld of all other readers is switched off altogether. To achieve this, a multiplexer sends a start
signal to one reader after the other in a cyclical sequence, which causes the addressed reader to
switch on its RF ﬁeld and check for the presence of a transponder (Figure 13.23). If the reader
discovers a transponder, then it activates a busy signal. The busy signal tells the control unit to

suppress the cyclical start signal for the duration of the busy signal. The active reader is now free
to perform the data exchange it has begun with the transponder. After the end of this transaction,
the active reader stops transmitting the busy signal, whereupon the multiplexer can continue its
cyclical interrogation.

Access Control
Electronic access control systems using data carriers are used to automatically check the access
authorisation of individuals to buildings, (commercial or event) premises, or individual rooms.
When designing such systems we must ﬁrst differentiate between two fundamentally different
systems with corresponding properties: online and ofﬂine systems.
13.7.1
Online Systems
Online systems tend to be used where the access authorization of a large number of people must
be checked at just a few entrances. This is the case, for example, at the main entrances to ofﬁce
buildings and commercial premises. In this type of system, all terminals are connected to a central
computer by means of a network. The central computer runs a database in which each terminal is
assigned all the data carriers authorised for access to that terminal. The authorisation data generated
from the database is loaded into the terminals (or into an intermediate door control unit) via the
network and saved there in a table.
Changes to an individual’s access authorisation can be made by a single entry on the central
computer of the access control system. The data carrier itself does not need to be present, since
only an entry in the central database has to be edited. This is advantageous, because it means that
sensitive security areas can be protected against unauthorised access, even in the event of a data
carrier being lost.
The data carriers of an online system only have to be able to store a small amount of data, for
example a unique pass number. The use of read-only transponders is also possible.
13.7.2
Ofﬂine Systems
Ofﬂine systems have become prevalent primarily in situations where many individual rooms, to
which only a few people have access, are to be equipped with an electronic access control system.
Each terminal saves a list of key identiﬁers (e.g. ‘general-key-3’, ‘ﬂoor-waiter-7’, ‘guest-room-
517’), for which access to this terminal is to be authorised. There is no network to other terminals
or a central computer.

386
RFID Handbook
Figure 13.25
Ofﬂine terminal integrated into a doorplate. The lock is released by holding the authorized
transponder in front of it. The door can then be opened by operating the handle. The door terminal can be
operated for a year with four 1.5 V Mignon batteries and even has a real time clock that allows it to check the
period of validity of the programmed data carrier. The terminals themselves are programmed by an infrared
data transmission using a portable infrared reader (reproduced by permission of H¨afele GmbH, D-Nagold)
Information regarding the rooms to which the data carrier can provide access is stored on the data
carrier itself in the form of a table of key identiﬁers (e.g. ‘guest-room-517’, ‘sauna’, ‘ﬁtness-room’).
The terminal compares all the key identiﬁers stored on a data carrier with those stored in its own
list and permits access as soon as a match is found. The transponder is programmed at a central
programming station, for example at the reception of a hotel upon the arrival of the guest. In addition
to the authorised rooms, the transponder can also be programmed with the duration of validity, so
that hotel keys, for example, are automatically invalidated on the departure date of the guest.
Only in the event of a data carrier being lost do key identiﬁers need to be deleted from the
terminal in question using a suitable programming device.
Ofﬂine systems offer the following advantages over conventional lock systems with key and
cylinder (Koch and Gaur, 1998):
• Early speciﬁcation on a lock plan in the normal sense is not necessary. The system is initially
coded for use as a ‘building-site’. When the site is handed over, the door terminals are recoded
for commercial use by means of an infrared interface. Subsequent changes and expansions do
not pose any problems.

Example Applications
387
• The option of programming time windows opens up further options: Temporary employees can
receive a ‘three-month key’, the data carriers of cleaning staff can be given precise time speci-
ﬁcations (for example Mondays and Fridays from 17.30 to 20.00).
• The loss of a key causes no problems. The data of the lost key is deleted from the read stations,
a new key is programmed, and this key’s data is entered on the terminals in question.
13.7.3
Transponders
Access control using PVC cards has been around for a long time. Punched cards were used initially,
which were superseded by infrared passes (IR barcode), magnetic strip passes, Wiegand passes
(magnetic metal strips), and ﬁnally smart cards incorporating a microchip (Schmidh¨ausler, 1995;
Virnich and Posten, 1992). The main disadvantage of these procedures is the inconvenience of the
operating procedure due to the fact that the cards must always be inserted into a reader the right
way round. Access control using contactless systems permits much greater ﬂexibility because the
transponder only needs to pass a short distance from the reader antenna. Passes can be made in the
form of contactless smart cards, key rings, and even wrist watches.
A great advantage of contactless access control systems is that the reader is maintenance-free
and is not inﬂuenced by dust, dirt or moisture. The antenna can be mounted beneath the surface of
a wall, where it is completely invisible and protected against vandalism. Hands-free readers are also

388
RFID Handbook
available for mounting in turnstiles or to increase convenience. In these designs, the transponders
do not even need to be removed from the pocket or jacket clip.
Cat ﬂaps operated by a transponder in the cat’s collar represent another application in the ﬁeld
of access control, as does the use of read-only transponders as anti-theft sensors for opening or
closing doors and windows (Miehling, 1996).
13.8
Transport Systems
13.8.1
Eurobalise S21
Although Europe is moving towards standardisation, cross-border transport still presents an obstacle
to Europe’s railways. Different signals and train security systems force trains to incur the cost of
carrying multiple sets of equipment on locomotives and traction units. It is often necessary to
expend precious time changing traction vehicles at the border, burdening trains with a disadvantage
compared with ﬂying or travelling by road (Lehmann, 1996).
For this reason, the European Union is backing the purchase of a uniﬁed European train security
and control system, the ETCS (European Train Control System). The ETCS will facilitate interop-
erable cross-border trafﬁc and improve the competitiveness of railways by implementing the latest
train control technology.
The ETCS comprises four main systems:
• EURO-Cab. A vehicle device, in which all connected elements are linked to the secure vehicle
computer EVC (European Vital Computer) by a special ETCS bus system.
• EURO-Radio. A GSM radio link between the vehicles and a radio centre by the track, the RBC
(Radio Block Center).
• EURO-Loop.
A system for linear data transfer over distances up to several hundred metres.
The system is based upon so-called leakage cables, i.e. coaxial cables for which the sheathing
is designed to be partially permeable to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The frequency ranges of this
application lie between around 80 MHz and 1 GHz (Ernst, 1996). EURO-Loop is primarily used
to transfer information for the evaluation of discretely transmitted data.
• Eurobalise. A system for the discrete transmission of data. Depending upon design, local data
(location marking, gradient proﬁles, speed limits) or signal-related data for the route are trans-
mitted to the vehicle (Lehmann, 1996).
The Eurobalise subsystem is particularly important, because it is a crucial prerequisite for the
full introduction of the ETCS. In January 1995, after lengthy experiments, the technical framework
data for Eurobalise were determined. It is an inductively coupled RFID system with anharmonic
feedback frequency.
The power supply to the system is taken from a passing traction unit by inductive coupling at
the ISM frequency 27.115 MHz. Data is transferred to the tractive unit at 4.24 MHz, and the system
is designed to reliably read the data telegram at train speeds of up to 500 km/h.
Four different balise types have been developed by Siemens:
• Type 1 transmits a permanently programmed telegram.
• Type 2 transmits a telegram that can be programmed by the user via the contactless interface.
For example, this may be line data such as gradient and speed proﬁles.
• Type 3 transmits a telegram generated by a line device (transparent balise). Type 3 is primarily
used in connection with signals.
• Type 4 makes it possible to download data as vehicles drive past.

International Container Transport
International freight transport containers have been identiﬁed using the alphanumeric identiﬁcation
procedure speciﬁed in the international standard ISO 6346 since the end of the 1960s. This iden-
tiﬁcation mark consists of four letters, the owner’s code, a six-digit numeric serial number and a
test digit, and is painted onto the outside of the container at a speciﬁed position.
Almost all of the 7 million containers in use worldwide employ the identiﬁcation procedures
speciﬁed in this standard and thus have their own, unmistakable identiﬁcation number. The process
of manually recording the container identiﬁcation number and entering it into the computer of a
transhipment plant is extremely susceptible to errors. Up to 30% of identiﬁcations have been falsely
recorded at some point. Automatic data transmission can help to solve this problem by the reading
of a transponder attached to the container. In 1991 the international standard ISO 10374 was drawn
up to provide a basis for the worldwide use of this technology.
The bands 888–889 MHz and 902–928 MHz (North America) and 2.4–2.5 GHz (Europe) are
used as the operating frequencies for the transponders. The transponders must respond on all three
of the frequency ranges used. Backscatter modulation (modulated reﬂection cross-section) with an
FSK modulated subcarrier is the procedure used for the data transfer from the container to the
Figure 13.29

391
reader. The subcarrier frequencies are 20 and 40 kHz. A total of 128 bits (16 bytes) are transmitted
within just 2 ms.
The reader’s signal is not modulated (read-only transponder). The speciﬁed maximum reader
distance is 13 m.
ISO 10374 speciﬁes the following information that can be stored in the transponder:
• owner’s code, serial number and test digit;
• container length, height and width;
• container type, i.e. suitcase container, tank container, open top container and others;
• laden and tare weight.
A battery provides the power supply to the electronic data carrier in the transponder (active
transponder). The lifetime of the battery corresponds to the lifetime of the container itself, i.e.
around 10–15 years.
The same technology is used in the identiﬁcation of goods wagons in North American and
European railway transport. A European standard is in preparation for the automatic identiﬁcation
of European interchangeable containers (Siedelmann, 1997).
13.9
Animal Identiﬁcation
13.9.1
Stock Keeping
Electronic identiﬁcation systems have been used in stock keeping for almost 20 years (Kern and
Wendl, 1997) and are now state of the art in Europe. In addition to internal applications for
automatic feeding and calculating productivity, these systems can also be used in inter-company
identiﬁcation, for the control of epidemics and quality assurance, and for tracing the origin of
animals. The required uniﬁed data transmission and coding procedures are provided by the 1996
Figure 13.30

392
RFID Handbook
ISO standards 11784 and 11785 (see Section 9.1). The speciﬁed frequency is 134.2 kHz, and FDX
and SEQ transponders can both be used.
There are four basic procedures for attaching the transponder to the animal: collar transponders,
ear tag transponders, injectible transponders and the so-called bolus (Figure 13.31). Cross-sections
of different types of transponders are shown in Figure 13.32.
Collar transponders can be easily transferred from one animal to another. This permits the use
of this system within a company. Possible applications are automatic feeding in a feeding stall and
measuring milk output.
Ear tags incorporating an RFID transponder compete with the much cheaper barcode ear tags.
However, the latter are not suitable for total automation, because barcode ear tags must be passed
a few centimetres from a hand reader to identify the animal. RFID ear tags, on the other hand, can
be read at a distance of up to 1 m.
Injectible transponders were ﬁrst used around 10 years ago. In this system, the transponder is
placed under the animal’s skin using a special tool. A ﬁxed connection is thereby made between
the animal’s body and the transponder, which can only be removed by an operation. This allows
the use of implants in inter-company applications, such as the veriﬁcation of origin and the control
of epidemics.

Enlargement of different types of glass transponder (reproduced by permission of Texas Instru-

The implant is in the form of a glass transponder of length 10, 20 or 30 mm (Figure 13.33).
The transponder is supplied in a sterile package or with a dose of disinfectant. The dimensions of
the glass transponder are amazingly small, considering that they contain the chip and a coil wound
around a ferrite rod. A typical format is 23.1 × 3.85 mm (Texas Instruments, 1996).
Various instruments and injection needles are available for performing the injection:
‘Single-shot’ devices use closed hollow needles (‘O’ shape), which are loaded individually.
Single-use needles containing transponders in a sterile package are also available. The hollow
needles are sharpened at the tip, so that the skin of the animal is ripped open when the needle is
inserted. The blunt upper part of the needle tip presses the cut ﬂap of skin to one side so that the
insertion point is covered up again when the needle has been removed, allowing the wound to heal
quickly (Kern, 1994).
The ‘Multi-shot’ device has a magazine for several transponders, thus dispensing with the need
to load the device. Open-ended hollow needles (U-shaped) are used, as these are easier to clean,
disinfect and check than closed hollow needles and can therefore be used several times.

attention should be given to hygiene to ensure that the wound heals safely.
An injected transponder represents a foreign body in the animal’s tissues. This can lead to
problems in the locational stability of the transponder within the animal’s body, and may therefore
cause problems when reading the transponder. From our experience of war injuries we know
that shrapnel can often wander several decimetres through the body during a person’s lifetime. An
injected transponder can also ‘wander’ around. To solve this problem, the Bayerischen Landesanstalt
f¨ur Landtechnik in Weihenstephan, a branch of the Technical University in Munich, has been
investigating various injection sites since 1989 (Kern, 1994). As a result of these studies, injection
under the scutulum is currently favoured over the use of the right ear, with the injection being
directed towards the occipital bone. According to ﬁndings of the Landanstalt, this position is also
suitable for measuring the animal’s body temperature.
The so-called bolus is a very useful method of ﬁtting the transponder. The bolus is a transponder
mounted in an acid-resistant, cylindrical housing, which may be made of a ceramic material. The
bolus is deposited in the rumen, the omasum that is present in all ruminants, via the gullet using
a sensor. Under normal circumstances the bolus remains in the stomach for the animal’s entire
lifetime. A particular advantage of this method is the simple introduction of the transponder into
the animal’s body, and in particular the fact that it does not cause any injury to the animal. The
removal of the bolus in the slaughter house is also simpler than the location and removal of an
injected transponder (Kern and Wendl, 1997).
It is clear that the injected transponder and the bolus are the only foolproof identiﬁcation systems
available to stock keepers. A more detailed comparison of the two systems (Kern and Wendl, 1997)

shows that the bolus is particularly suited for use in the extensive type of stock keeping that is
prevalent in Australia or South America. In intensive stock keeping methods, commonly used in
central Europe, both systems appear to be suitable. The degree to which bolus, injection or even
RFID ear tags will become the industry standard means of identiﬁcation remains to be seen. See

13.9.2
Carrier Pigeon Races
Participating in races is a signiﬁcant part of carrier pigeon breeding. In these races, hundreds of
pigeons are released at the same place and time, at a location a long distance from their home.

396

Figure 13.38
Example of automated animal recognition in practice: grouping calves properly for feeding
often requires much time and effort. Here a machine takes on this task: the animals can receive an individually
adjustable amount of milk in several small portions (reproduced by permission of Dr Michael Klindtworth,
Bayerische Landesanstalt f¨ur Landtechnik, Freising)
Pigeons are judged by the time they take to return home from the point where they were released.
One problem is the reliable recording (conﬁrmation) of arrival times, because in the past the breeders
themselves recorded the times using a mechanical conﬁrmation clock.
To solve the problem of timing, the pigeons are ﬁtted with rings that incorporate a read-only
transponder based upon a glass transponder. As the pigeons are loaded onto the transporter for
transport to the release site, the serial numbers of the transponders are read to register the animals
for participation in the race. Upon the pigeon’s arrival at its home pigeon loft a reader installed in
the compartment records the serial number and stores it, together with the precise arrival time, in
a portable control unit. Judging takes place by the reading of the devices at the operating point.
However, the ingenuity of some of the breeders was greatly underestimated when this system
was ﬁrst introduced. It was not long before some breeders were not only able to read the transponder
codes from the pigeon ring, but could also fool the reader using a simulation device in the home
loft. The technology involved was fairly simple – all that was required was an extremely simple
read-only transponder, whose ‘serial number’ could be altered using external DIP switches. Thus,
some breeders were able to signiﬁcantly accelerate the ‘ﬂight speeds’ of their champions.

Example Applications
397
An effective measure to protect against such attempts at fraud is the incorporation of an additional
writable EEPROM memory into the transponder. The memory size is just 1 byte to keep the chip
size and cost of circuitry low. Before the start, a previously determined random number, for which
there are 28 = 256 possibilities, is written to this byte in the transponder at the race headquarters.
It is crucial that the breeder does not have access to his bird while it is being transported to the
release site after the transponder has been programmed. This prevents the random number from
being read. When the pigeon reaches its home loft, its arrival is conﬁrmed electronically. The time,

together with the transponder code and the secret random number are stored. When the records are
evaluated at the headquarters, the random number read upon arrival is compared with the number
programmed at the start. The measured times are only validated if the two ﬁgures are identical,
otherwise it is assumed that an attempted fraud has taken place.
The procedure described is clearly adequate to successfully prevent attempted fraud. With 256
possibilities for the random number the probability that this will be guessed correctly in a single
attempt is only 0.4%.
In order to keep the weight and dimensions of the pigeon transponder low, glass transponders
are used in this application, which are cast into a plastic ring. These plastic rings can be fastened
to the pigeon’s leg without hindering the animal or causing it any discomfort.
13.10
Electronic Immobilisation
The sharp rise in vehicle theft at the beginning of the 1990s – particularly in Germany – boosted
the demand for effective anti-theft systems. Battery-operated remote control devices with a range
of 5–20 m had already been available on the market for years. These are small infrared or RF
transmitters operating on the UHF frequency 433.92 MHz, which are primarily used to control the
central locking system and an integral alarm. An (electronic) immobiliser may also be coupled to
the remote control function. In this type of anti-theft device, however, the mechanical lock can still
be used to gain access to the vehicle – in case the remote control device fails to work due to the
failure of the battery in the transmitter. This is the greatest weakness of this type of system, as
the system cannot check whether the mechanical key is genuine. Vehicles secured in this manner
can therefore be opened with a suitable tool (e.g. picklock) and started up by an unauthorised
person.
Since the middle of the 1990s, transponder technology has provided a solution that can be
used to check the authenticity, i.e. the genuineness, of the key. This solution has proved ideal for
the realisation of the electronic immobilisation function via the ignition lock. Today, transponder
technology is usually combined with the above-mentioned remote control system: the remote control
operates the vehicle’s central locking and alarm system, while transponder technology performs the
immobilisation function.

13.10.1
The Functionality of an Immobilisation System
In an electronic immobilisation system a mechanical ignition key is combined with a transponder.
The miniature transponder with a ferrite antenna is incorporated directly into the top of the key
(see Figure 13.42).
The reader antenna is integrated into the ignition lock in such a manner that when the ignition
key is inserted, the (inductive) coupling between reader antenna and transponder coil is optimised.
The transponder is supplied with energy via the inductive coupling and is therefore totally mainte-
nance free. Electronic immobilisers typically operate at a transmission frequency in the LF range
100–135 kHz. ASK modulation is the preferred modulation procedure for the data transfer to the
transponder, because it allows reader and transponder to be manufactured very cheaply (Doerﬂer,
1994). Load modulation is the only procedure used for data transmission from the transponder to
the reader.
When the ignition key is turned in the ignition lock to start the vehicle, the reader is activated
and data is exchanged with the transponder in the ignition key. Three procedures are employed to
check the authenticity of the key.
• Checking of an individual serial number. In almost all transponder systems the transponder has
a simple individual serial number (unique number). If the normal number of binary positions
is used, signiﬁcantly more different codes are available than worldwide car production (232 =

400
RFID Handbook
4.3 billion, 248 = 2.8 × 1014). Very simple systems (ﬁrst generation immobilisation) read the
transponder’s serial number and compare this with a reference number stored in the reader. If
the two numbers are identical the motor electronics are released. The problem here is the fact that
the transponder serial number is not protected against unauthorised reading and, in theory, this
serial number could be read by an attacker and copied to a special transponder with a writable
serial number.
• Rolling code procedure.
Every time the key is operated a new number is written to the key
transponder’s memory. This number is generated by a pseudorandom number generator in the
vehicle reader. It is therefore impossible to duplicate the transponder if this system is used.
If several keys are used with one vehicle then each key runs through its own pseudorandom
sequence.
• Cryptographic procedures (authentication) with ﬁxed keys. The use of cryptographic procedures
offers much greater security (second generation immobilisation). In the authentication sequence
(challenge response) knowledge of a secret (binary) key is checked, without this key being
transmitted (see Chapter 8). In vehicle applications, however, unilateral authentication of the key
transponder by the reader in the ignition lock is sufﬁcient.
The RFID reader now communicates with the vehicle’s motor electronics, although this com-
munication is protected by cryptographic procedures. The motor electronics control all important
vehicle functions, in particular the ignition system and fuel system. Simply short-circuiting or
disconnecting certain cables and wires is no longer sufﬁcient to circumvent an electronic immo-
bilisation system. Even attempting to fool the motor electronics by inserting another ignition key

of the same type into the ignition lock is bound to fail because of the authentication procedure
between reader and motor electronics. Only the vehicle’s own key has the correct (binary) key to
successfully complete the authentication sequence with the motor electronics.
The installation of such an electronic immobiliser to the engine management system can only
be performed at the factory by the vehicle manufacturer, thus guaranteeing optimal interaction
between engine control system and security device. The individual key data is programmed in the
factory by laser-programmable fuses on the chip or by writing to an OTP-EEPROM. The vehicle
manufacturer is also responsible for implementing appropriate security measures to prevent crim-
inals from unlawfully procuring replacement parts (Wolff, 1994). With few exceptions, electronic
immobilisation systems have been ﬁtted to all new cars as standard since the beginning of 1995
(Anselm, 1996).
13.10.2
Brief Success Story
In 1989 the Berlin wall and the border to Eastern Europe were opened, and the years following
1989 were characterised by dramatic increases in vehicle thefts in Germany. From 48 514 thefts
in 1988, the ﬁgure had risen to 144 057 thefts just ﬁve years later in 1993 – almost a threefold
increase. This prompted the German Federal Supervisory Ofﬁce for Insurance to declare a change
to the General Insurance Conditions for Motor Vehicle Insurance (AKB) at the beginning of 1993.
According to the old conditions, vehicle owners with fully comprehensive insurance could, under
certain conditions, claim the full price for a new car if their vehicle was stolen, although the resale
value of the stolen vehicle and thus the damage suffered was signiﬁcantly less than this (Wolff,
1994). The value of a vehicle after just a few months falls a long way short of the price of a new car.
Under the new conditions, only the cost of replacing the vehicle, i.e. its actual market value, is
refunded in the case of loss (accident, theft, etc.). Furthermore, if the loss is due to theft an excess
is deducted from the payment, which may be waived if the vehicle is ﬁtted with an approved

402
RFID Handbook
anti-theft device (Wolff, 1994). The vehicle owner’s own interest in having an effective anti-theft
device was signiﬁcantly increased by the new insurance conditions.
The effectiveness of electronic immobilisation has been clearly demonstrated by the decreasing
trend in vehicle thefts in Germany. In 1994 there had already been a slight fall of about 2000 to
142 113, compared to the record ﬁgure from 1993. Two years later – 1996 – 110 764 thefts were
reported. This represents a fall of 22% in just 2 years.
Another factor is that since 1995 electronic immobilisers have been ﬁtted to all new cars – with
a few exceptions – in the factory as standard. If we consider vehicles secured in this manner alone,
then we can expect a reduction in the theft rate by a factor of 40(!).
In this connection it is interesting to examine investigations by insurance companies into vehicle
thefts where electronic immobilisers were ﬁtted (Anselm, 1995, 1996; Caspers, 1997).
Of 147 stolen vehicles in 1996, 70% of thefts were performed using the original key, which the
thief had obtained by breaking into homes, garages and workshops, or by stealing from ofﬁces, bags
and changing rooms, or by the fraudulent renting and misappropriation of rental or demonstration
cars. In the remaining 30% of cases, the vehicles either disappeared under circumstances that
indicated the cooperation of the owner (without this being proved in individual cases), or vehicles
were loaded onto lorries and transported away by professionals.
There has not been one case since 1995 where the electronic immobiliser has been ‘cracked’ or
beaten by a thief.
13.10.3
Predictions
The next generation of immobilisers will also incorporate a passive, cryptologically secured access
system. In this system, a reader will be ﬁtted in each of the vehicle’s doors. Sequential systems
(TIRIS) will be able to achieve a remote range, in which the transponder is supplied by a battery,

so that the vehicle’s central locking system can be operated from a greater distance away. This is
similar in its function to the combination of an immobiliser and central locking remote control on
a single transponder.
13.11
Container Identiﬁcation
13.11.1
Gas Bottles and Chemical Containers
Gas and chemicals are transported in high-quality rented containers. Selecting the wrong bottle
during reﬁlling or use could have fatal consequences. In addition to product-speciﬁc sealing systems,
a clear identiﬁcation system can help to prevent such errors. A machine-readable identiﬁcation
system gives additional protection (Braunkohle, 1997). A large proportion of containers supplied
today are identiﬁed by barcodes. However, in industrial use the popular barcode system is not
reliable enough, and its short lifetime means that maintenance is expensive.
Transponders also have a much higher storage capacity than conventional barcodes. Therefore
additional information can be attached to the containers, such as owner details, contents, volumes,
maximum ﬁlling pressure and analysis data. The transponder data can also be changed at will, and
security mechanisms (authentication) can be used to prevent unauthorised writing or reading of the
stored data.
Inductively coupled transponders operating in the frequency range <135 kHz are used. The
transponder coil is housed in a ferrite shell to shield it from the metal surface (see also Section
4.1.12.3).
The manufacturing process for the transponders is subject to exacting standards: the transponders
are designed for an extended temperature range from −40 to +120 ◦C; their height is just 3 mm.
These transponders must also be resistant to damp, impact, vibrations, dirt, radiation and acids
(B¨uhrlen, 1995).
Because the transmission procedure for transponders used in container identiﬁcation has not been
standardised, various systems are available. Because a device has been developed that can process
all the transponder types used, the user can choose between the different transponder systems – or
may even use a combination of different systems.

Mobile and stationary readers are available. Stationary readers can be incorporated into a produc-
tion system which automatically recognises and rejects wrong containers. After ﬁlling, the current
product data is automatically stored on the transponder. When this system is used in combination
with database management, the number of containers used by a customer for a given gas con-
sumption can be drastically reduced, because excessive standing times or storage periods can be
easily recognised and corrected. In addition, all the stations that the container passes through on its
way to the customer and back can be automatically recorded by the use of additional readers. So,
for example, it is possible to trace customers who return the containers dirty (Braunkohle, 1997).
For gas, where there is not much potential for product differentiation between manufacturers, the
associated cost savings can convey an important competitive advantage (B¨uhrlen, 1995).
In total, over eight million gas bottles in Germany alone are waiting to be ﬁtted with
transponders. For Europe, this ﬁgure is approximately 30 million. In addition to gas bottles,
transponders are also used for rental containers, beer kegs and boxes and transportation containers
for the delivery industry.
13.11.2
Waste Disposal
Because of increasingly rigorous environmental legislation, the cost of waste disposal is increasing
all the time. Costs associated with creating new waste disposal sites and maintaining existing sites

405
are being passed on to individual households and industrial companies. Automatic measurement
of the amount of waste produced helps to distribute the costs fairly. For this reason, more and
more cities are using RFID systems to optimise communal waste disposal, and are thus putting the
conditions in place for replacing the ﬂat rate charge for waste disposal with a charge based upon
the quantity of waste produced. The waste disposal companies will only charge for the amount that
has actually been removed.
To achieve this goal, a transponder is ﬁtted to the dustbin and automatic reader systems are
installed in rubbish collection vehicles. As soon as the dustbin is placed on the vehicle’s emptying
device its transponder is read. In addition, either the weight or the volume of rubbish is calculated,
depending upon the preference of the community. A counter, to show how often the bin has been
emptied in the year, is also feasible (EURO-ID, n.d.).
The identiﬁer read by the transponder is stored in a smart card in the vehicle’s on-board computer
together with the data collected. At the end of a round the driver passes the card to the operations
centre so that the collected data can be processed. Individual households no longer pay a monthly
ﬂat rate, but each receive an individual bill (Prawitz, 1996).
In Germany RFID systems are already in use in various cities, including Bremen, Cologne and
Dresden, and in numerous communities.
13.12
Sporting Events
In large-scale sporting events such as major marathons, the runners who start at the back of the
ﬁeld are always at a disadvantage, because their times are calculated from the moment the race is
started. For many runners it takes several minutes before they actually cross the starting line. In
very large events with 10 000 participants or more, it might be 5 minutes before the last runners
have crossed the starting line. Without individual timing, the runners in the back rows are therefore
at a severe disadvantage.
To rectify this injustice, all runners carry a transponder with them. The system is based upon
the idea that each runner places his feet repeatedly on the ground and thus comes very close to a
ground antenna. In experimental events it was found that using a ingenious arrangement of multiple
antennas in an array and a chip in the shoe over 1000 runners can be registered up to eight times
in a minute with a start width of just 4 m (ChampionChip, n.d.).
The transponder is based upon a glass transponder operating in the frequency range 135 kHz,
embedded into a specially shaped (ABS) injection moulded housing (Figure 13.50). To get the
transponder as close as possible to the ground – and thus to the antenna of the time measurement
device – this is attached to the runner’s shoe using the shoelaces.
The reader antennas are cast into thin mats and can thus be placed on the ground and still be
protected from all environmental inﬂuences. The dimensions of a single mat are 2.10 × 1.00 m. At
a normal running speed a net time resolution of ±1 s is possible, derived from the time the runner
remains within the read range of a mat. The accuracy for cyclists improves to ±0.2 s. The measured
time is immediately displayed on a screen, so that the reader can read his current intermediate time
or ﬁnal time as he passes a control station.
The runner can make a one-off purchase of the transponder for ¤20 and then use it wherever
compatible timing systems are used.
The performance of a transponder-based timing system has been demonstrated at the following
events: Rotterdam Marathon (10 000 participants), Shell Hanseatic Marathon, Hamburg (11 500
participants) and the Berlin Marathon (13 500 participants) (Champion-chip).

Industrial Automation
13.13.1
Tool Identiﬁcation
As well as its metal cutting tool industry, Germany’s woodworking industry also plays a dominant
role in the world market. The modern woodworking and furniture manufacturing industry is dom-
inated by CNC technology because this enables manufacturers to manufacture at a low cost and
remain competitive.
CNC machines equipped with tool holders and automatic tool changers fulﬁl tasks that are
increasingly associated with small batch production. This increases the proportion of manufacturing
costs incurred by retooling and tool-change times.
Another consideration is the fact that a CNC woodworking machine differs from a metalworking
machine because of its higher rotation and path speeds. Rotation speeds from 1000 min−1 to more
than 20 000 min−1 (!) are attained in wood and plastic processing. The risk of accidents for worker
and machine is therefore very high during the tool-change operation; for example, hazards may be
caused by the wrong ﬁtting of the CNC machine’s chain magazine (Leitz, n.d.; T¨oppel, 1996).
This potential hazard can be eliminated by ﬁtting a transponder in the taper shaft or in the
retention bolts of the toolholder. All relevant tool data are preprogrammed into the transponder
by the tool manufacturer. The machine operator ﬁts the transponder tools into the CNC machine’s
toolholder in any order. Then the CNC machine initiates an automatic read sequence of all tools
in the toolholder, during which the tools are ﬁrst ordered into toolholder positions and then all
geometric and technical data for the tools is transmitted correctly to the tool management system of
the CNC control unit. There is no manual data entry, which eliminates the possibility of human error
(Leitz, n.d.). The danger of accidents due to excessive speeds, the selection of the wrong rotation
direction or the incorrect positioning of the tool in relation to the workpiece is thus eliminated.
Inductively coupled transponders operating in the frequency range <135 kHz are used. The
transponder coil is mounted on a ferrite core to shield it from the metal surface (see also Sections
4.1.12.3 and 2.2). The transponder must have a minimum of 256 bytes of memory, which is written
with an ASCII string containing the required tool data. An example of a data record is illustrated
in Table 13.4.

Modern transponder coded CNC tools can be incorporated into a cost-saving production and
service cycle. The service cycle is incorporated, smoothly and simply, into the production cycle as
follows.
The worn tool is ﬁrst examined and measured in detail to determine its condition. The tool is
then serviced, sharpened and balanced on the basis of this data. After every maintenance sequence
the tool length and radius is updated and written to the transponder, so that correctly dimensioned
workpieces are produced by both new and sharpened tools without intervention by the operator.

with the same stage of production being performed at a certain position on the assembly line time
after time. For the present, a production process of this type is only able to produce objects that are
identical in function and appearance. However, the days are numbered for machines that produce
large quantities of a single product with no variants.
If different variants of a product are to be produced at the same time on an assembly line in an
automated procedure, the object must be identiﬁed and its status clearly recognised at every work
station, so that the correct processes can be performed. Originally, this was achieved by objects being
accompanied by process cards, which gave the operating personnel all the information required at a
particular workstation – the desired paint colour, for example. This was ﬁrst achieved in electronic
form using coding pegs afﬁxed to the revolving palettes so that palette numbers could be read
by the electronic control system. The position of these coding pegs could be sensed by inductive
proximity switches (Weisshaupt and Gubler, 1992). This procedure has recently been improved by
the use of barcode labels, which can simply be stuck onto the individual objects.
RFID technology now provides an additional option – data carriers that can not only be read, but
also written. Now, in addition to recording the identity of an object, it is also possible to document
its current status (e.g. processing level, quality data) and the past and future (desired end state) of
the object.
Using modern identiﬁcation techniques, production systems can now be realised which can
produce variants of a product, or even different products, down to a batch size of one (Weisshaupt
and Gubler, 1992). The automotive industry is a good example: since vehicles are predominantly
produced to order and it is rare for two identical vehicles to be ordered, automatic material ﬂow
tracking is crucial to smooth operation. A vehicle must be clearly identiﬁed at the individual
manufacturing stages to avoid, for example, an unwanted air conditioning system from being ﬁtted,
or the wrong paint colour being applied during painting (Homburg, 1996).
There are two possible methods of controlling a system based upon object data: centralised and
decentralised control.
13.13.2.1
Centralised Control
In this approach, material ﬂow and object status are continuously monitored during the process and
are stored in a database on a central computer. This builds up an image of the current process data

The object and data ﬂow in a central control system is performed using completely separate
routes. The central computer has a powerful database in which all process data is stored
and system status in the process control system of the central computer. It makes no difference
whether the status of objects in the process is determined using barcodes, radio, optical character
recognition, RFID or any other type of information coding and transmission.
The monitoring of the process must be completely infallible, otherwise there is a danger that an
object will become out of control. Restarting the system after a fault or the crashing of the control
software can be a particularly critical moment.
Centralised control systems based upon a powerful central database are particularly common
when it is necessary to access the information from different locations simultaneously, when a
transparent image of process data must be available continuously for other purposes, or if important
data needs to be stored permanently (Homburg, 1996). Apart from production, typical applications
include stores technology, logistics or the collection of operating data.
13.13.2.2
Decentralised Control
The use of readable and writable data carriers opens up the possibility of controlling a system locally,
i.e. completely independently of the central process computer. Each object carries a complete data
record with it that contains information about its identity, its current status, its history and its
future – material and data ﬂow are thus interlinked. For this to be successful, it must be possible
not only to read the relevant data from the object at each processing station, but also to change and
update this information. Of all known identiﬁcation technologies, this can only be achieved with
the necessary reliability using writable RFID transponders.
The option of changing the object data in the transponder at each processing station means that
it is possible to create an information ﬂow between the individual processing stations, which takes
the pressure off the control system. Production and processing operations are becoming faster all
the time, so the fact that information can be carried with the object and is available in the right
place can become a decisive factor in speeding processes up. Due to possible overheads associated
with accessing a remote database, readers in systems that operate at a rate of seconds are becoming

In a decentralised system the data is carried along with the objects
increasingly unable to keep pace with the process, for example in the setting of points or the
initiation of the correct processing operation (Homburg, 1996).
13.13.2.3
Beneﬁts from the use of RFID Systems
• Quality control. In modern production lines the quality of products is tested at test points located
at a number of stations. When the product is inspected at the end of the production process, it
must be possible to unambiguously attribute the quality data gathered earlier to the correct object.
With writable transponders that travel with the product this is easy to achieve because all the
quality data obtained during the production process is carried with the object.
• System security.
Shifting object data from the central computer to the object signiﬁcantly
increases system security. Even after software crashes or failures of the central computer, the
relationship between an object and its current data can be established anywhere and at any time.
If necessary, objects can also be withdrawn from the production process without losing the data.
If the object is subsequently put back into the process, work can continue without problems or
faults occurring (Weisshaupt and Gubler, 1992).
• Data security.
Protecting the data stored in the transponder using a checksum procedure (e.g.
CRC, see Section 7.1) ensures the complete security of the data that has been read. Read errors
are recognised as such and the data ignored.
• Flexibility.
The use of writable transponders facilitates much more ﬂexible control of the
manufacturing process. For example, the set-up data for universally programmable robots and pro-
duction machines can be written to the transponder carried with the object during the preparatory
stage and is available immediately where it is needed. Using this technique, products can be man-
ufactured right down to a batch size of one, without having to set up a complex communication
with the central computer for each object.
• Harsh environmental conditions.
RFID systems are completely insensitive to dust, moisture,
oils, coolants, cuttings, gases, high temperatures and similar problems that can occur in a manu-
facturing environment. Glass and plastic transponders usually comply with protection type IP67;
that is, they are totally dustproof and waterproof. Even particularly dusty or dirty environmental
conditions, which would make the use of barcode readers impossible due to the rapid blocking
of scanner optics, pose no problems for RFID systems.

13.13.2.4
The Selection of a Suitable RFID System
When selecting a suitable RFID system for use in the production process, the characteristics of the
different memory technologies should be considered (see also Section 10.3).
EEPROM
Data stored in an EEPROM is retained for several years without a power supply. The energy
required for writing to or reading from a transponder using EEPROM technology is transmitted by
inductive coupling. Since the transponders do not require a battery they may be very small. The
guaranteed number of write access operations to a memory address is typically around 105 cycles,
which is greater than the lifetime of the transponder. However, an innovative type of EEPROM
technology is now available on the market which can be reprogrammed more than 106 times. This
can be increased still further by the use of FRAM memory technology. Over 1010 write cycles are
already being achieved using this technology.
SRAM
In contrast to EEPROMS, SRAM memory cells require a constant power supply to retain stored
data. Therefore, transponders using this memory technology always have their own battery. Data
transmission between reader and transponder employs either inductive coupling or the backscatter
procedure (microwave). SRAM memory can be reprogrammed any number of times with high write
speeds. However, the integral battery limits the temperature range of this transponder to 0–60 ◦C.
13.13.2.5
Example Projects
Let us now consider a few examples of the use of RFID systems in manufacturing. It is no
coincidence that most of the examples described here are taken from the automotive industry. In
this industry in particular companies are continuously striving to optimise the production process.
In BMW’s Dingolﬁng factory (Southern Germany), the car bodies of the 7 and 5 Series were
originally identiﬁed manually at the identiﬁcation points using barcode readers. To cut costs, a

After successful identiﬁcation of the vehicle, its speciﬁc data is interrogated and displayed
(reproduced by permission of Pepperl & Fuchs GmbH, Mannheim)
microwave identiﬁcation system was installed (2.45 GHz, transmission power of reader: 10 mW) at
the end of 1996. A transponder is now ﬁtted to the bonnet of each painted body as it enters the
production process and data for the model (e.g. chassis number) is written to this transponder. A
total of around 3000 transponders are in circulation. Around 70 readers are installed in the assembly
area at individual identiﬁcation points in the various assembly stages. As soon as the body enters
the interrogation zone of a reader the read process is initiated by an inductive proximity switch.
The required data is read from, or if necessary written to, the transponder. The transponders are
equipped with a battery designed for a lifetime of 8 years. They have a memory size of 32 Kbytes,
and the range of up to 4 m is sufﬁcient in all stages of assembly (Pepperl & Fuchs, 1998, n.d.a).
In Mercedes Benz’s Tuscaloosa factory in the USA, inductively coupled transponders (125 kHz,
read-only system) are used for the identiﬁcation of skids for vehicle bodies. After the skid has
travelled through the painting line several times it must be cleaned. This selection process can be
performed without incurring additional costs by data capture using transponders (Schenk, 1997).
In the production of its 1E Generation, vehicle manufacturer General Motors produces 26 dif-
ferent engine models under one roof at its Flint factory (Michigan, USA). The product range
incorporates a multitude of engine types, which includes 1997 to 1998 models, 5.0 to 5.7 litre
engines, engines for automatic or shift transmission, engines for export, engines designed to run
on environmental fuel and petrol, and engines for cars and lorries. Fitting the product carriers with
transponders (13.56 MHz, 8 Kbyte memory) makes it possible to track and identify all engine models
throughout the production process. Using RFID it is possible to trace any engine in the factory within
seconds. Around 50 readers are installed in the production area for this purpose (Escort, 1998a).
The John Deere Company in Waterloo (Iowa, USA), the worldwide market leader in the produc-
tion of agricultural machinery, employs an inductively coupled RFID system in the manufacture of
tractors. The tractor bodies are equipped with special transponders that can withstand temperatures
of up to 225 ◦C, and can even communicate with a reader at these temperatures, which means that

416
RFID Handbook
they can be used in the painting ovens (Escort, 1998b). The data carriers (13.56 MHz, 8 Kbyte
memory) can be easily ﬁtted to the rear axle of the tractor chassis. Because most tractors are
manufactured to order, the use of modern identiﬁcation technology allows tractors to be adapted to
individual customer requirements.
The use of RFID systems in the meat processing industry is another interesting example. Barcode
systems cannot be used due to the high temperatures of above 100 ◦C during canning and the long
cooling periods. The company J. M. Schneider Meats, one of the largest meat processing companies
in Canada with 15 factories, therefore uses an inductively coupled RFID system in the processing
sequence for product identiﬁcation and tracking. At the beginning of the process the meat is stacked
onto mobile shelves. The meat is conveyed into the chill room via the smoking chambers on these
shelves and in the last stage of processing it is heated to above 100 ◦C for conservation. It is vital
that the company always knows precisely where the individual shelves are and which process they
are currently undergoing. Transponders are therefore attached to the individual shelves (13.56 MHz)
and signiﬁcant data, such as the location of the shelves, meat type and weight data, is written to
the transponder. The delivery time of the meat, which depends upon its use-by date, can also be
consistently tracked by means of the RFID system (Escort, 1998c).
A further application that should clarify how RFID systems can help to increase the quality
of a product by tolerance selection (Pepperl & Fuchs, n.d.b) is illustrated in Figure 13.60. This
application involves the assembly of a precision clutch release stop. The system consists of a pallet
rotary system, two robots and a manual work station. All the pallets are equipped with transponders.
The individual components that make up the stop are measured by one of the robots and these
measurements are used to assemble components so that the play in the ﬁnished stop is minimised.
This allocation of individual components to each other is written as data to the transponder and
thus carried along with the individual components. The second robot is an assembly robot which
assembles the individual components into a stop. At this point the data is read from the transponder,
so that the robot can always assemble the correct individual components.

antenna are visible in the lower part of the photo (reproduced by permission of Pepperl & Fuchs GmbH,

Example Applications
417
The use of RFID systems can also bring beneﬁts in storekeeping and order processing. One
of the leading pharmaceutical companies, Sanacorp in Munich, has an electronically controlled
stock keeping and order processing system, which allows products to be automatically collected
in accordance with the delivery note. More than 6000 consignment containers (plastic containers)
pass through the stores every day and need to be identiﬁed at individual loading points. In the old
system using barcode labels or reﬂective code labels up to 100 errors occurred daily, meaning that
the falsely identiﬁed consignment containers passed through all the loading points on the way to
the goods outwards, thus delaying the entire consignment. To guarantee the infallible recognition
of the consignment containers these were ﬁtted with transponders (134 kHz, SEQ), which were
welded to the base of the plastic trough. The reader antennas are located under the conveyor belts
at the relevant stations. As soon as a consignment container rolls into the interrogation zone of
a reader the transponder is read and the stored data is transferred to the stock-control computer.
The central computer is informed of where each consignment container is located, whether delays
are occurring during loading, and how busy the individual loading points are. The rapid collection
of goods from the stores is important because customers, who are mainly pharmacists, expect the
consignment to arrive on time and to be complete. This can only be guaranteed by a technically
infallible order picking procedure (Sander and Mollik, 1997).
13.14
Medical Applications
The ability of passive transponders to operate reliably for years without their own power
supply – which may be susceptible to failure – predestined this technology for applications in
human medicine.
Glaucoma is a condition in which increased intraocular pressure (IOP) at ﬁrst causes a narrowing
of the ﬁeld of vision, and ultimately results in complete blindness. The latest research has shown
that intraocular pressure is subject to sharp diurnal ﬂuctuations and that not only the absolute
pressure, but also the pressure ﬂuctuations, signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the risk of blindness (Ullerich,
2001). Therefore, the continuous measurement of the intraocular pressure under normal conditions
and in the patient’s normal environment is necessary to improve understanding of the progression
of the condition and facilitate an individual programme of treatment (B¨ogel and Niederholz, 2001).
This is in contrast to the normal practice of measuring IOP exclusively during surgery hours with
the aid of a tonometer.

An implanted transponder with a pressure sensor, and an antenna coil integrated into the frame
of a pair of glasses make up the system for the continuous measurement of intraocular pressure (reproduced

In patients with a cataract, the natural lens is removed from the eye and replaced by an artiﬁcial
intraocular lens. This prompted the idea of integrating a full transponder, i.e. a microcoil and a
transponder chip with an integral capacitive pressure sensor, into the haptic of such an artiﬁcial
intraocular lens. Figure 13.61 shows such a transponder unit after casting in PDMS (polydimethyl-
siloxane), a soft silicon normally used for the manufacture of artiﬁcial lenses.
The external diameter of the microcoil is around 10.3 mm and the internal diameter 7.7 mm.
For the optical part of the lens 5 mm is speciﬁed. The microcoil is manufactured on a ﬂexible
polyimide foil (Ullerich, 2001; Ullerich et al., 2000, 2001a,b) and is thus foldable, which makes
the implanting of the transponder much easier. The pressure sensor is micromechanically integrated
into he transponder chip and has a sensitivity of 1.3 mbar, which roughly corresponds with the
precision of current tonometer measurements (Ullerich, 2001).
So that the transponder can be read continuously, the reader’s antenna is integrated into the
frame of a pair of glasses. The control of the coil and the storage of the measured data takes place
with the aid of the reader, which is connected to the glasses via a cable.

Figure 14.9
Screen dump of the program ‘MIFARE Magic’ during a read process of the transponder (repro-
duced by permission of Gerhard Schalk)
The reader shown can communicate with all transponders that are compatible with ISO/IEC
14443-A or MIFARE. This reader was developed with the goal to be as universally applicable as
possible. It can be directly operated on a PC with the USB interface of the reader. In addition, the
reader can be operated in stand-alone mode, for instance for access control. A housing and LCD
display complete the reader, but they are not always necessary (Schalk, 2006).
The circuit and the corresponding freeware PC program ‘MIFARE Magic’ make it possible to
easily read and write on diverse ISO/IEC 14443-A and MIFARE transponders (e.g. NXP MIFARE
UltraLight, MIFARE 1K and MIFARE 4K) without requiring additional reader software. The user
interface of the PC program ‘MIFARE Magic’ also provides the possibility to send individual
commands via mouse click to a transponder and thus to check the transponder’s properties in a
very simple way.
It is even simpler in stand-alone operation when an LCD display is connected to the reader.
Once the reader is supplied with voltage it polls for transponders within a read range of 5 cm. In
stand-alone operation, the PC programme can be used to easily deﬁne which data of a read-out
transponder should be displayed and which actions the reader should carry out (Schalk, 2006). If a
transponder is situated in the read range it is possible to display only its serial number (UID) or to
activate an access control function. In this case, preconﬁgured contents are displayed and several
actions are carried out (Figure 14.8).
