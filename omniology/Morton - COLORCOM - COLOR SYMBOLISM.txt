About Color Printing
This publication was designed for on screen viewing. Colors will appear different when printed
with a typical computer printer. The colored inks are based on the CMYK (cyan, magenta,
yellow, black) system which is different from the RGB system used by computer monitors and
electronic publications.
Also, the color swatches take up a lot of area in this publication and will consume a large
quantity of ink!

INTRODUCTION

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Like voodoo, color can sway thinking, change actions, and cause reactions.
Red means "stop" and green means "go." Traffic lights send this universal
message. Likewise, the colors used for a logo, business card, product,
packaging, web site, interior design, architectural elements, or clothing cause
powerful reactions. Color sends a subliminal message, one which plays a
critical role in success or failure. It will either attract or distract, work for you
or against you.
The subliminal power of color is serious business. Consequently, the
information in this book is presented in a methodical way. You might think the
tone is a bit academic, but it will deliver clear concepts about color symbolism
so that you can use it to your advantage.
About Color Voodoo

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
This publication was designed for electronic distribution and computer viewing. All colors
represented in this publication are based on the 216 colors which are common to both Windows
and Macintosh computers and can be viewed on 8 bit (256 color) monitors.
Every effort has been made to reproduce colors accurately. All illustrations were prepared on
a system with full gamma correction and color synchronization. Colors may vary on different
computers.
Anti-glare screens may cause color distortions.
If you have a PC running WIN 98, WIN 95 or  WIN 3.1, make sure your
computer system has full gamma correction. A high quality monitor is
essential. A video or graphic card might be needed for accurate color
readings.
Macintosh computers, Silicon Graphics workstations, and machines running NeXTStep should
deliver highly accurate color and will not need any gamma correction. A corrected gamma of
1.8 is built into these machines. Older monitors may require some adjustments.A gamma
control panel device should be used to check and adjust the gamma.
Computer Colors

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Monitors and printers reproduce colors differently. Monitors use
the red, green, blue (RGB) color model. Printing is based on
the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) color model.
Colors on-screen may look different when printed.
Color Models

Design Applications
The color information and illustrations in this publication will assist in developing a successful
color scheme for all areas of design. Since these illustrations and color formulas are based on the
RGB color model, variables may occur when using other color systems. The following provides
important information about these variables:
Labels, Packaging, Business Cards, Stationery and Signage
The RGB values of  the colors may be used as a reference for appropriate specifications for
printing and other media.
Products
The RGB values may be used as a reference for enamels, glazes, paint, textile dyes, and other
color media.
Wardrobe
The color swatches may be used as a reference for wardrobe selections.
Note: The special information about the gender based appeal of the red family of colors is especially
useful for color communication in wardrobes.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Interior Design and Architecture
The color swatches may be used as a departure point for interior or exterior color schemes.
Caution should be used in paint and wall covering  selections. The colors of the swatches in this
publication will be quite different when applied to large interior or exterior surfaces. Muted colors
will wind up looking much more colorful. Some colors may turn out too pale, others, too dark.
Consult with a paint representative and/or a design professional. Large brush-outs will give you a
better idea of end results. Similar caution should be used when selecting carpeting and other
elements which cover large areas.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Web Site Design Applications
The color information and illustrations in this publication are specifically applicable to web
site design. All web site graphics (gifs and jpegs), background colors, text and link colors are
based on the RGB color system. Since this is an electronic publication, the same RGB color
system was used for all color illustrations. What you see in this publication is an accurate
representation of web site colors, one which will help you develop successful colors for web
site design.
The HEX code is included for each color swatch. This may be used to specify background
colors, text, or link colors in html documents. The RGB values are also supplied and may be
used for non-dithering colors for graphic illustrations.
Since these illustrations and color formulas are based on the RGB color system, variables
may occur when using other color systems. If you print this publication, the colors may deviate
from their on screen accuracy.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
1. Know your target market.
As a case study, let’s assume you’re selecting colors for a bank. Financial institutions require
colors which support a sense of security, trust and reliability. The color of currency also comes
into play. A risky color would be purple since many of its primary associations are related to the
intangible world of creativity, spirituality, mystery and the sub-conscious. Nevertheless, if that
financial institution is located in Charlotte North Carolina, the home town of the famed Charlotte
Hornets basketball team, whose colors happen to be purple and teal, and if the membership of
that bank is primarily female, purple combined with another color is worthy of consideration.
As a general rule of thumb, you have a lot more flexibility in color selections for a regional business.
If, on the other hand, the business intends to expand its base nationally or globally, off-beat color
selections should be avoided.
2. Use extreme caution with global audiences.
When designing for a global market, designers must subject their color selections to stringent
cross-examination. If a color’s symbolism does not support the fundamental characteristics of a
product, service, person or place, and if it is insensitive to a specific culture, that color may
communicate in surprising ways.
Tips for Color Communication - Global Design & Web Sites

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Consider again the color purple. It may work as a symbol of creativity for art and as a symbol of
the extra-terrestrial for science fiction, but it’s a polarizing color. People either love it or hate it.
Furthermore, it’s potentially hazardous on a global level. It may symbolize mourning and death in
many cultures in the same way that black does in American culture.
A significant example of purple failure is the initial design of EuroDisney’s signs. The color palette
was intended to rival Coca Cola’s red, but the final selection of vast amounts of purple was a
tragic mistake. Purple symbolizes death and the crucifixion in Catholic Europe. It’s not surprising
that visitors thought the signs were morbid. How did this happen? The CEO liked purple. [1]
Personal preference and “avant-garde” tactics frequently cause color disasters. When the wrong
color is used on a web site, the damage extends to a global audience.
[1] Euroclash, ID Magazine, January 1992, p.61
3. Use caution with “in” colors.
Just because a certain color is a color marketer’s “in” color for the year (or next year, or the
decade) doesn’t mean it will work for everything and it certainly doesn’t mean that it will work
globally. The late 20th century bore witness to the popularity of yellow-green which ranged in hue
from a soft avocado-green to an acidic lime-green. It infiltrated fashion and home furnishings in
American culture. Print advertising, television and web sites embraced it for a “cutting edge” look.
The more acid the hue, the more it became an “in your face” symbol of the avant-garde.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
In spite of this, most shades of yellow-green do not enhance the image of baked goods, toothpaste,
cosmetics or gastro-intestinal products. Consequently, this color would only add negative or
confusing associations.
4. Don’t use personal preference.
The most common color mistake is selecting a color because you like it. Some people will argue
that they feel very comfortable with a certain color or that they like the way it looks in a certain
context. One designer fell in love with the aqua and yellow color combination of Bahama's license
plates. He proceeded to use these colors as the core color scheme on a web site for a paper
manufacturer located in Maine. Not by any stretch of the imagination do these colors support this
product. They serve only to confuse the viewer, thus discouraging exploration of the web site.
Surround yourself with your favorite colors but remember, color communication is a science.
Objectively analyze the product or theme of your project. (Advise your client to do the same!)
5. When in doubt, don't.
Most people have an intuitive warning system. If you're feeling a little queasy about a color
selection, chances are it's wrong. Test it out by selecting a color one step removed such as a
blue-green instead of a blue. You may be close to your mark or way off!

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
6. When in doubt, stick to timeless symbolism.
The timeless psychological associations and natural references of any given color should be
foremost. For example, red is the color of fire and blood. Psychologically it is a dynamic energizing
color. It is far removed from any symbolic association of serenity or dependability.
(Refer to the text descriptions in this publication.)
7. Prepare for color mutations on the web.
Think about the last time you were in an electronics store and viewed dozens of television sets in
a row. The picture was darker on some sets, the contrast varied, and, on closer examination you
may have noticed that flesh tones and even the colors of the trees and sky were different. The
possibility for color mutations is even greater in web site design.
Here’s what you can do:
a. Make sure your computer has good color vision.
Start by establishing the best color standard in your computer's operating system. If you're
designing on a PC (Windows), correct your gamma by buying the best components and
components that work well together. If you're designing on a Mac or SGI workstation, sufficient
gamma correction is built into your system. Beware of anti-glare screen devices.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
b. Use the 216 web color palette.
Although each browser has a vocabulary of 256 colors, only 216 colors are common to both PC's
and Macintosh computers. Using a web-safe palette will ensure that the colors you select are
standard on all  computers and all Web browsers. Also, if you select colors outside of the 216
palette, the color may consist of speckles of colors. This effect is called dithering and can cause
severe problems in background colors, text, and all link colors. Note: This palette does not mean
that the color you select will look exactly the same on all computers. Colors are generated by the
computer's operating system and monitor, not the palette. Nevertheless, the 216 web-safe colors
are a very reliable standard.
(Note: All colors in  this publication are part of the 216 color web-safe palette.)
c. Foresee the variables on other computers.
Preview your work on several different computers. If you’re on a Mac, check out your designs on
a Windows PC with 256 colors (8 bit). You may be surprised by the relative darkness of your hues
as well as non-linear color shifts. Teal greens may appear much bluer, sandy beiges may shift into
peachy tans. If you’re on a PC, chances are you’ll be amazed at how much lighter colors are on a
Mac. The previously described color shifts will also be evident.

Idioms in American English

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Introduction to Color Symbolism
Nature provides a significant starting point for color symbolism. Natural references, such as fire
and water, play a powerful role in the symbolic meaning of the respective  colors. This symbolism
can be considered timeless. Other symbolic meanings change over time and are considered
timely. These are linked to politics, fashion, religion, myths, and geography.
The color symbolism in this publication is based primarily on Western culture. In some situations,
different countries in the Western world may attach different meanings to some colors. The colors
of the nation’s flag, the colors of a nation’s sports team, and other conventions will affect the
symbolism of certain colors. For example, the symbolism of orange will be quite different in the
Netherlands, where the Royal House is referred to as “The House of Orange.”
Much of the information about color symbolism comes from data gathered from  "The Global
Color Survey" located at the Color Matters web site. This database consists of thousands of
entries from all points on the globe.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
Categories of Color Symbolism
The first category, "References in Nature," includes natural elements that one would find at any
time on Earth.
The second category "Psychological Symbolism,"  includes positive and negative associations.
Other symbolic categories that may be applied to a color, include:
"Contemporary Culture" (objects and associations that have evolved in the Twentieth Century),
"Religious,"  "Historical / Political,"  "Other Cultures," and "Fashion."  These categories are included
only when they are relevant to a color.
Of special note are the color codes from OSHA  (Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration).
Although this an American standard for industry, there are significant similarities to psychological
and natural associations.
A list of idiomatic expressions in American English is also included as a final reflection on
symbolism.

Color Voodoo #1 - A Guide to Color Symbolism
About the layout of the swatches
The colors in this publication are divided into the following
groups: red, purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, brown,
black, white and gray.  In some cases, the dividing line
between the color groups is quite fluid and can not be
considered an absolute. The primary focus is on the
symbolic descriptions of each color rather than on a rigid
positioning.
The colors are arranged in chromatic order. For example,
greens begin with "teal green" (a green with a slight blue
cast), progress to pure green, and end with olive green (a
green with a yellow cast).
Similar versions of the same color are grouped sequentially.
These groupings may include a light version, a medium
version, a dark version, a bright version and a muted
version of the same "parent" color.

About the terms used
 The English language does not support a wide range of color terms beyond the names of basic
hues, such as “red” and “blue.” In addition to the basic color names, colors may also be described
by references to naturally occurring objects, such as “burgundy” or “lime”. Designer color terms
such as “Antique White” and “Riviera Blue” are not accurate and are not used in this publication.
In order to differentiate each color, the following descriptive terms are used:
Dark - a dark version of the color, one which is a “shade” of the original color
Medium - a medium or medium-light version of the color
Light - a light version of the color, one which is a pastel or “tint “ of the original color
Muted - a dull, less colorful version of the color
Bright - a very pure, very intense, very saturated version of the color
Deep - a very rich version of the color, a  full bodied color in spite of its relative darkness
Some colors may also be described with terms such as “yellow-based” or “blue-based." For example,
a tomato red is a “yellow-based” red. In other words, tomato red is a red with a slight yellow-orange
cast to it.  Raspberry red is a “blue-based” red, one with a slight blue cast to it. These distinctions
affect the gender-based appeal of red. In other colors, they serve to differentiate one from another.
Since the emphasis is on constructive applications of colors, positive descriptions are used for the
symbolism of each individual color. Refer back to the symbolic analysis of each color for possible
negative associations.
