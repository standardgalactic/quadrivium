About the Author
An occasional welder and steel fabricator, Marty Nachel is also a freelance
writer on beer and brewing. As a member of the North American Guild of
Beer Writers, in September 1996 Marty was voted one of the three best beer
writers in the United States at the N.A.G.B.W. Quill & Tankard Awards at the
Great American Beer Festival in Denver.
A former President of the Chicago Beer Society and founding member of the
Brewers Of South Suburbia (B.O.S.S.) homebrew and beer appreciation club,
Marty has been brewing his own award-winning beers since 1985. In 1986, he
was the first person in the state of Illinois to become a Certified Beer Judge.
In addition to his homebrew judging duties, Marty served on the panel of
beer evaluators at the prestigious Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago,
home of the World Beer Championships, as well as the Great American Beer
Festival in Denver, Colorado.
Marty has been the writer of the newsletters that accompany monthly ship-
ments of microbrewed beer from Beer Across America since October 1992.
His articles have also appeared in  All About Beer magazine, Brew Magazine,
Brew Your Own magazine, Celebrator Beer News, Drink magazine, Fine
Cooking magazine, Zymurgy Magazine, and Epicurious.com. In 1998 Marty
was also tapped to write the beer and brewing entries for the latest edition
of Microsoft’s Encarta Encyclopedia. His first book on the microbrewing
industry, Beer Across America (Storey Communications), was published in
July of 1995. Marty’s second book, Beer For Dummies (Wiley Publishing),
was a huge hit when it was published in August of 1996.
Travel in search of good beer has taken Marty to over 200 breweries and
brewpubs and assorted beer festivals and shrines throughout Europe
and North America. When he can find the  time, Marty also likes to collect
breweriana.

Dedication
Were it not for my wife, Patti, and the 32 years she has dedicated to her
career, I would not know the pleasure of writing about beer for a living.
Though she and our two children reap secondary dividends from our profes-
sional/domestic arrangement, no one benefits more from it than I. Thank you,
Dear, from the bottom of my pint glass.
Author’s Acknowledgments
My sincere thanks to all the people at John Wiley & Sons for creating this
unique opportunity. I would especially like to thank Acquisitions Editor
Tracy Boggier for her part in making this all happen, as well as for giving
me the proper focus in the early stages of this project. I also enjoyed working
with my talented Copy Editor, Megan Knoll, and I’m grateful for her amazing
attention to detail. A big thanks also to my Editorial Program Coordinator
Erin Calligan Mooney, who helped re-secure all of the permissions for the
recipes that appear in this book. Finally, heartfelt thanks to the Composition
Services crew for all their behind-the-scenes help and effort. I owe you all a
round of my best brew!
Most importantly, I would like to thank my Project Editor, Alissa Schwipps,
for her patience, focus, and direction (did I mention patience?) — all of
which created a comfortable and confident working relationship that made
the writing and editing of this book much easier and more enjoyable.
Again, I would like to thank my agent and book producer Steve Ettlinger for
his boundless energy and enthusiasm while working on Beer For Dummies, a
project which subsequently paved the way for this book. I am indebted to
him for his vision, guidance, and professionalism.
Over the years I have been fortunate to meet and befriend many beer-
knowledgeable people who have influenced me and my brewing ability. One
of these people is Mike Pezan, a dedicated homebrewer-turned-professional
brewer and Beer Geek of the highest order. His technical know-how pumped
life into the more advanced chapters of this book and his quick wit and sense
of humor helped infuse these otherwise dry subjects with much needed levity.
Speaking of technical know-how, many thanks to Dr. Joe Formanek, my
Technical Editor. Dr. Formanek is well respected in homebrewing circles,
especially in the Midwest, where he continues to win scores of awards for his
incredibly tasty homebrew. A couple of Joe’s award-winning beer recipes can
be found in the recipe section of this book.

Thanks also to Jim Dudley, sales manager at Northwestern Extract Co. Jim
was kind enough to share his database of homebrew recipes with me for this
project. And my sincere thanks to Steve Kamp, Joe Formanek, Tim Reiter,
Mark Merisco, and Tom Dennis, who graciously responded to my call for
some last-minute beer and mead recipes — I think you’ll really like the 
award-winning brews they provided.
Too numerous to mention by name are the many gifted homebrewers in the
Chicago Beer Society, the Urban Knaves of Grain, and the Brewers Of South
Suburbia (B.O.S.S.) whose talents inspired me to take up homebrewing in the
first place and continue to challenge me to new brewing heights each and
every year. Through this book, may their enthusiasm infect you all. . . .

In Memoriam
In 1985, a talented brewer by the name of Russell Schehrer won the coveted
“Homebrewer of the Year” award at the National Homebrew Competition in
Boulder, Colorado. Using that accomplishment as a springboard, Russell
launched a short but brilliant career as a brewer and brewing consultant in
the fledgling microbrewing industry.
I had the pleasure of meeting Russell Schehrer briefly one summer afternoon
several years ago. Amidst his busy brewing schedule, he took the time to
show me around his brewhouse at Wynkoop Brewing Company in Denver.
The impromptu tour included a visit to the lagering cellar downstairs, where
he proudly proffered samples of his beers fresh from the fermenters. Once
back at the bar, he casually chatted with me as I tasted my way through a
complimentary flight of house brews.
Though our meeting was brief, it gave me a short insight into Russ’s love of
good beer and his dedication to his craft. And it was cause for me to mourn
his sudden passing in 1996 at the age of 38. Russ’s spirit and enthusiasm
sparked both the homebrewing and craft brewing communities in the United
States; he has, likewise, been missed by both.

Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
I’m just a humble homebrewer,
I’ve got no shiny copper.
I only brew five gallons a batch —
I just boil ’er up and hop ’er.
No foil labels, no fancy caps,
just plain glass bottle and stopper.
I pay no tax — just brew and relax,
then grab a beer and pop ’er!
H
omebrewing is one of the most sublime hobbies. Like growing vegeta-
bles in your backyard garden or baking bread in your own kitchen,
homebrewing enables you to recapture the hands-on rusticity of the olden
days while producing something that’s an absolute delight to consume. Just
as nothing can substitute for layering a salad with tomatoes and cucumbers
picked fresh from your own garden, nothing is as gratifying as sipping a fresh
beer brewed on your own kitchen stove.
In addition to the personal enjoyment you can gain from drinking your own
beer, you can’t deny the deep sense of gratification that accompanies the kudos
and congratulations of friends, family, and coworkers who equally enjoy your
homebrewing efforts. Perhaps best of all is the widespread recognition that
comes from winning awards — often quite valuable — in acknowledgment of
your brewing prowess and expertise. This list of benefits is a just a glimmer
of what homebrewing is like today.
The hobby hasn’t always been this way. Modern homebrewing in the United
States wasn’t even a legal enterprise until 1979. Even after it became legal,
homebrew still bore the disparaging mantle of bathtub booze and other such
pejoratives, a residue of the illicit beer-making days during national prohibition.
Fortunately, we’ve come full circle. Homebrewers have been rightly credited
with being the catalyst of the recent American brewing renaissance. The
early homebrew pioneering spirits, longing for a beer more satisfying than
the homogenous mass-market brands, were the ones who went on to open
the first of the microbreweries that are so popular today. And as more of these
craft-brewing operations open across the country and throughout the world,
they expose more and more people to small-brewery quality and diversity.
Inspired by the craft-brewing ethic and enthusiasm, many more people are
now interested in brewing beer at home.

Following in footsteps far greater than my own, I began brewing my own beer
in 1985. I didn’t start homebrewing for lack of good beer, because plenty of
good, locally available commercial beers were available. I chose to brew my
own beer because I wanted to personally experience the magic of the beer
making process. After I started homebrewing, I quickly became hooked and
realized only much later that as much as I was consuming the hobby of
homebrewing, it was also consuming me.
So I had my own reasons for homebrewing — but why should you start?
Because homebrewers tend to develop a love and enjoyment and respect for
beer beyond its simple consumption. Homebrewers are ethereally connected
to both the brewing past and the brewing future; they’re champions of both a
medieval art and an advanced science. Plus, the homebrewing community-at-
large shares a common sense of purpose — of sharing information and ideas,
of promoting education as part of the hobby, and of enriching and enlightening
the general public by improving its collective perception of beer.
And despite anything you may have seen or heard or assumed on your own,
facial hair isn’t a prerequisite to being a good homebrewer. On the other
hand, growing wild hair now and again is strongly encouraged among those
who brew their own beer at home.
About This Book
I’ve written this book primarily with brewer wannabes in mind — those who
have always stood on the sidelines wondering what it’s like to play in the
game. But unlike baseball, football, soccer, or any other team game of physical
ability, homebrewing is more like a singles card game — one in which you can
improve your skill through repetitive play (and at your own pace).
But this book isn’t just a primer on the joy of playing Solitaire (if you’ll excuse
the analogy). This book tells you everything you need to know about this
particular deck of cards, how to shuffle the deck, how to deal the cards, how
to play various card games at different levels of difficulty, and finally, how to
find and associate with others who share your interest.
Unlike other how-to books, Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition is arranged
in such a way that you need not read it in order, cover to cover. Using the
many cross-references provided within the text enables you to jump around
to those sections that are of greatest interest to you. Please notice, however,
that certain chapters deal with topics that depend on your having read some
previous chapters for basic comprehension. But don’t worry; where this sort
of thing occurs, I make the point clear.
Whether you’ve ever made a homebrew — or even tasted one, for that matter —
isn’t important for you to read and appreciate this book. Even with so many
different beers to make and so many different ways to make them, you should
2
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

eventually be able to master them all after reading Homebrewing For Dummies,
2nd Edition. This book not only provides all the parameters of tried-and-true
beer styles but also encourages you, the reader, to go off on your own brewing
tangent. Be bold, be daring; invent a beer style all your own — just be ready
and willing to share it with others.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the For Dummies series to
make things consistent and easy to understand:
 All Web addresses appear in mono font.
 New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps.
I use many additional conventions throughout this book, and I think I should
explain them to you:
 All recipes and text assume that the batch size is 5 gallons: Unless I
say otherwise, you can assume that all recipes create a 5-gallon batch of
beer. The same goes for any other times that I discuss quantities or
aspects of a batch of beer.
 The text and recipes use U.S. measurements: Every weight and liquid
measurement is given in standard pounds, gallons, and ounces. See the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for conversions.
 All beer styles and beer-style parameters are based on the American
Homebrewers Association Beer Style Guidelines: This hierarchical listing
of major beer-style classifications and substyles (which you can find on
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book) was established by the AHA for
recipe formulation and evaluation purposes.
What You’re Not to Read
I’ve written this book to help you achieve your dream of becoming a world-
class homebrewer. I made a special effort to include as much information
about homebrewing as possible. However, you may consider some of this
information nonessential and choose to skip certain parts. Here are some
parts you may want to pass over, at least until you’ve had a chance to read
the more important stuff. 
3
Introduction

 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that appear
occasionally throughout the book. They share anecdotal information
and observations, but aren’t necessary reading.
 Technical Stuff icons: This information is geared toward those folks
who thrive on tech-heavy details about homebrewing. 
 Any of the fine print: None of this hard-to-read information is going to
help you brew good beer anyway.
Foolish Assumptions
I wrote this book with some thoughts about you in mind. Here’s what I
assume about you, my reader:
 You like beer.
 You want to brew your own beer at home.
 You weren’t convinced brewing good beer at home was possible.
 You want to impress your friends and family with your new hobby.
 You’ve already brewed your own beer but want to make it even better.
 You’re already a homebrewer, but you’re looking for all the latest tips,
trends, and recipes available. 
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized this book into eight parts and crammed several chapters into
each part. Feel free to check out the table of contents to find the subject that
interests you most (or, more likely, is giving you the most fits). No matter how
you decide to use this book, the following sections give you a general idea of
what you find between its yellow and black covers.
Part I: First Things First
When you’re ready to begin brewing, you gotta start somewhere. This part
gives you the basic homebrewing overview and equipment list so you can get
started making your own beer. It also includes the all-important chapter on
how to keep your home brewery and equipment clean and sanitized in order
to make good beer. After you start brewing and are looking to progress in your
hobby, c’mon back to Part I to check out the upgraded equipment lists —
you’ll be glad you did.
4
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts 
and Bolts of Beer
Beer is made with four basic ingredients: barley (malt), hops, yeast, and water.
In keeping with this breakdown, I dedicate an entire chapter to each of these
gems. Because these ingredients are the very being of beer, I’m sure you’ll want
to savor every word of these chapters (and every drop of the beer they create).
Having said this, however, you’ll also find many more ingredients and additives
and such that you can use to your advantage when brewing beer at home.
That’s why I’ve included an additional two chapters in this part.
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew!
From making your very first kit beer to brewing an entire batch from scratch, the
chapters in this part walk you through the various steps necessary at the
Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of homebrewing. And then, of course,
you’ll need to keep your beer in something until you’re ready to drink it, so I’ve
added another couple of chapters to explain options for packaging your beer.
Part IV: Homebrew Recipes
This part is your ticket to paradise. More than 100 recipes at three levels of
difficulty are here for you to try and enjoy; many of them are proven award-
winners. I also include many beer-style profiles. Bottoms up!
Part V: Alternative Brewing
Sometimes the same-old, same-old doesn’t always work for people. That’s
why I’ve included some chapters on making alternative beverages by using
the equipment you already have. Most of these beverages are about options
and personal choice, but at least one chapter deals with making a beverage
that addresses important dietary restrictions.
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test
Is your homebrew good? How do you know? Part VI not only helps you to
discern quality homebrew on your own but also points you to outside sources
of helpful feedback on your beer. Ultimately, this part is about making better
beer and about maximizing your brewing and drinking pleasure.

Introduction

Part VII: The Part of Tens
In the For Dummies tradition, the Part of Tens is a small collection of valuable
information designed to help answer vexing questions or provide direction to
even more helpful information found elsewhere. If you happen to get a
chuckle along the way, so much the better.
This book wouldn’t be complete without the appendix. I’ve compiled tons of
important homebrewing information for your benefit, and I cross-reference
this information often throughout this book. Don’t miss it!
Icons Used in This Book
In keeping with the traditional For Dummies style, this book uses icons — those
little pictures in the margins — to serve as guideposts for various kinds of infor-
mation. You can use them to pick out information customized to your needs.
Explains technical subjects that are important only if you’re really getting
into homebrewing (or you’re a techno-head). Those who are neither of these
can skip these sections altogether.
Flags information that, if not read carefully, can cause you to botch a 
batch of beer.
Shows pointers, suggestions, and recommendations that can make your
homebrewing go more smoothly.
Draws your attention to important information you should remember for
future reference. Sometimes it flags material that I’ve already mentioned else-
where but that you should read again (for good measure).
Highlights some highly recommended products, services, or techniques. 
Try ‘em — you’ll be glad you did!
The “things that make you go ‘huh!’ “ member of the icon family. Tells funny,
intriguing, or just plain interesting beer trivia or lore. Excellent material for
homebrewing banter with your friends, if you’re into that sort of thing.

Where to Go from Here
Now that you have a quick overview of what to expect from this book, you
can begin your trek through the world of homebrewing. Go ahead, flip through
the book or begin with Chapter 1 — it doesn’t matter to me. All I ask is that
you have fun with your hobby and never take yourself or your brew too
seriously.
Still here? What are you waiting for?

omebrewing is a fun and enjoyable hobby, but 
you can’t join in the fun until you have a little under-
standing of the craft as well as the necessary equipment.

 Why brew at home?
 Do I have what it takes?
O
ne vexing question for the homebrewer wannabe is “why go through the
trouble of brewing beer at home when I can just buy it at the local store?”
Well, for starters, brewing beer at home is no trouble if you enjoy what you’re
doing, and with the help of this book, you can certainly enjoy homebrewing.
Secondly, homebrewed beer can be every bit as good as — if not better than —
a lot of commercial beer, with more flavor and character than most. In fact,
avoiding mass-market beer was the original inspiration for homebrewing.
Thirdly, homebrewing is a hobby that pays many dividends, from having your
own house brand of beer to hanging colorful award ribbons on your wall to
earning the undying admiration of your beer-drinking buddies. (Warning:
Admiration can be addictive.)
In this chapter, I give you an overview of the topics covered in detail in the
rest of the book as well as a bit of the history of homebrewing and its recent
surge in popularity.
Homebrewers Abound!
Becoming a homebrewer means you’re in good company. According to the
American Homebrewers Association (AHA) in Boulder, Colorado, an estimated
1 million homebrewers are brewing in the United States. That’s a lot of brewers.
And the hobby continues to expand every year. Recent estimates indicate that
over 1,000 homebrew supply retailers and several hundred homebrewing
clubs have popped up in response to homebrewing’s growing popularity.
Most of these clubs are small, but the national group (AHA) boasts 15,000
members. Homebrewing associations are growing worldwide, too.

12
Part I: First Things First 
The explosive growth in homebrewing has been closely mirrored by a tremen-
dous increase in small, craft breweries in the U.S. — this is no coincidence.
Since homebrewing became legal almost 30 years ago, the interest in hand-
crafted beer has blossomed, and over 1,500 brewpubs and microbreweries
have opened in this same period of time. The growth in the American craft-
brewing industry has been so dynamic that even European countries with
long and respected brewing histories have had no choice but to sit up and
take notice. Small, craft breweries have begun opening up in Canada, England,
Germany, and elsewhere in Europe.
In the more than 20 years that I’ve been involved in homebrewing, I’ve had
the pleasure of meeting and speaking with hundreds of people who share a
common interest in beer and homebrewing. Here are some of the reasons so
many folks seem to enjoy brewing their own beer:
 To participate in the do-it-yourself homebrewing trend — what other
hobby allows you to drink the fruits of your labor?
 To make beers comparable to hard-to-find microbrews and expensive
brews from around the world.
 To share homebrewed beer with friends and family members (beware of
mooches).
All the Right Stuff
New homebrewers are no different from other hobbyists; they’re champing at
the bit (or foaming at the mouth) to get started with their hobby. Although
this unbridled enthusiasm is good, jumping headlong into the unknown isn’t.
You need to incorporate some degree of planning into your decision to home-
brew. What kind of equipment do I need, and where can I find it? How much
time do I need to dedicate to this whole process? What kind of ingredients do
I need, and where can I buy them? What other preparations do I need to make?
What do I do with the beer when I finish brewing? Can I take a homebrewer’s
deduction on the IRS 1040 long form? These are the questions you need to
ask (and answer!) before you make the plunge. Conveniently, all the answers
you need are right here in this book. (And no, the IRS doesn’t give a home-
brewer’s tax deduction. Sorry.)
Gathering the equipment you need
Like having the right tools to do work around your house, having the right
equipment for brewing your beer is essential.

Although the equipment needed at the beginner level is relatively inexpensive,
you may want to try your hand at brewing beer without the cost commitment
of buying the equipment first. If you’re fortunate enough to live near one, try
brewing a batch of beer at a Brew On Premises (BOP), using the BOP’s equipment
and facilities. (BOPs are breweries at which individuals can brew their own
batch of beer.) If you happen to know of other homebrewers in your area, ask
to participate in one of their brews so you can get a feel for the hobby, or
search out local homebrew clubs for assistance.
If you’re ready to commit to buying your own equipment, check out Chapter
2 for all the details on the equipment required to get started and pursue each
level of brewing thereafter.
Tracing the homebrewing timeline
Homebrewing wannabes are understandably concerned with how much of a
time commitment is necessary to brew beer at home. To someone not familiar
with the fermentation processes, this takes a little extra explaining. First, you
have the hands-on part of brewing: the actual cooking of the wort (unfer-
mented beer; rhymes with dirt) on the stovetop, the fermentation (conversion
of sugars to alcohol and CO2 by yeast) and aging (maturation) processes, and
then the bottling of the beer. What most people aren’t aware of is the hands-off
part of brewing — the stage when the brewer does nothing but wait patiently.
This part not only constitutes the longest segment of the timeline, but it also
represents a test of the brewer’s patience and self-restraint.
At the beginner level, you need at least two or three hours on brewing day to
properly sanitize the equipment, brew and cool the wort, pitch the yeast (add
it to your wort), seal the fermenter, and clean up whatever mess you made.
(Part III details the brewing day process.) You need to set aside the same
amount of time on the day you bottle the beer. (Chapter 13 provides all you
need to know about bottling.)
In between the brewing and bottling days, however, you face the little matter
of fermentation. The yeast needs at least seven days to complete the fermen-
tation cycle — sometimes more, depending on extenuating circumstances.
You need do nothing more than wait patiently for the yeast to complete its
task. Even after you’ve bottled your beer, you still need to wait patiently while
your brew conditions in the bottles — two weeks is the recommended mini-
mum length of this conditioning process.

Chapter 1: Welcome to the Wonderful World of Wort

At the beginner level, if you brew on a Saturday your brewing timeline may
look something like the following:
1. Brew day (S). Ferment the beer Su-M-T-W-Th-F.
2. Bottle day (S). Condition the beer Su-M-T-W-Th-F-S-Su-M-T-W-Th-F.
3. Drink the beer!
As you begin to employ different ingredients, equipment, and processes in
your beer-making repertoire, expect the timeline to expand. Secondary fer-
mentation (a helpful extra aging step — see Chapter 11) adds another two
weeks to the timeline, and advanced brewers, for example, may spend as
many as eight to ten hours in a single day brewing their beer from grain (see
Chapter 12).
Please note that homebrewing is a pursuit that requires a higher degree of
dedication than, say, su doku puzzles, but the rewards are considerable (and
tasty!) In addition to personal gratification, quality homebrew can inspire a
certain respect from your fellow brewers, awe in nonbrewers, and other
intangibles that make all the effort worthwhile.
Adding ingredients galore!
Like various kinds of bread, all beer styles consist of the same basic ingredients.
The difference is that the ingredients vary slightly in attributes and quantities
required from one beer style to the next. Although wheat bread may look and
taste different than rye bread, they’re very much alike and made in very much
the same way.
At the commercial level, brewing uses grain (mostly malted barley), hops,
yeast, and water (see Chapters 4 through 7). Thanks to many stores and
Internet sites that specialize in homebrewing supplies, homebrewers today
have access to most of the same ingredients used by corporate brewhouses
everywhere. Of course, these shops don’t just provide the everyday ingredients
for the average beer; different hop varieties and yeast strains from around the
world are now available in the homebrewing market.
With the help of specially made products, such as malt syrup derived from
grain (see Chapter 4), beginner homebrewers can easily produce beers that
emulate those made commercially. Intermediate- and advanced-level home-
brewers may even make their beer with the same grains used by their
favorite commercial brewers.

Part I: First Things First 

Beyond the four basic building blocks of beer, dozens of other flavorings and
additives can contribute different flavors and textures to your brew (see
Chapter 8), and a number of other agents can affect the appearance of your
brew (see Chapter 9).
Although thriftiness is a virtue, you need high-quality ingredients to produce
high-quality beer — so loosen your grip on the purse strings when buying
homebrew ingredients.
Not all of these ingredients are necessary to make great beer, but they exist
for you, the brewer, to use if you’re so inclined. In your house, you’re the Head
Brewer — you make the choices (but read about ‘em in Parts II and III first).
Like home cooking, homebrewing doesn’t come with an automatic guarantee
of quality. Certain responsibilities and expectations are squarely on the
brewer to ensure that each batch of beer turns out right. Failure to heed
simple rules and suggestions can result in a less-than-perfect brew and a
waste of time, effort, and money.
Preparing wisely
Good homebrew starts with good preparation, and good preparation starts with
a complete list of ingredients. Nothing is more aggravating than starting your
brewing procedures only to find that you’re missing a necessary ingredient. Before
you head off to your homebrew supply shop or submit a mail-order form, con-
sider all your needs. Occasionally, homebrewers fail to look beyond the beer
recipe and forget something as simple — but essential — as bottle caps.
Another important preparation consideration is having the brewery in order —
clearing your workspace of clutter and having all your equipment present
and accounted for (see Chapter 2). Removing free-roaming pets to another
part of the house is always a good idea.
Sanitizing your equipment is also high on the preparation checklist (see
Chapter 3); you never want your brew to come in contact with equipment that
isn’t properly clean and sanitized to protect against beer-ruining bacteria.

Chapter 1: Welcome to the Wonderful World of Wort

All done — now what?
So, say your beer is done and ready to drink — what next? Well, grab a bottle
opener, a clean beer glass, and a seat, because it’s time to revel in your suc-
cess. While you’re admiring the brew in your glass and savoring its flavor on
your palate, consider how you can best commemorate your efforts:
 Invite a bunch of your closest (and thirstiest) buddies over to sample it.
 Give it away as gifts to close friends and family members deserving of
your time and talent.
 Increase your good standing with bosses and other influential people by
presenting them with a bottle of beer of your own making.
 Swap a couple of bottles with other homebrewers in your area.
 Submit some entries to homebrew competitions around the country.
(See Chapter 25 to find out more about homebrew competitions.)
One of the most incredible awards is having your homebrew replicated and sold
by a nationally distributed brand — kinda like your mom’s chocolate chip
cookies being made by Sara Lee. Several well-known microbrewers solicit home-
brew entries to their own annual, sponsored competitions. The winners may
receive a cash award and royalties or have their beer recipe reproduced as a
one-time-only specialty beer and sold to the public. For example, every year the
Boston Beer Company hosts the Samuel Adams LongShot competition. Two
winners get their beer brewed, packaged, and nationally distributed for a
limited time in the LongShot Variety Pack. Check out http://www.samuel
adams.com/promotions/LongShot/Default.aspx for more information
on entering this contest.
Or you can do as I do when I’m particularly pleased with a batch of brew —
hoard it, hide it, jealously guard it, and only take a bottle out to celebrate the
most sublime accomplishments in life — like making another batch of great beer!

F
orget any preconceived notions you may have about shiny copper 
kettles and coils taking up your whole kitchen and huge wooden vats
bubbling and churning in the cellar — those notions are the product of 
vivid imaginations and vintage Hollywood movies. Human civilization is well
into the stainless-steel and plastic age, where everything is smaller, more
durable, and lighter weight.
Every homebrewer is a first-time brewer at least once, which means that
every homebrewer needs to start with at least the minimum amount of equip-
ment. With its barest essentials, homebrewing requires three tools: a brewpot
in which you boil the wort (the German term for beer before it’s fermented), 
a container in which you ferment the beer (the fermenter), and bottles in
which you package the beer.
If this list sounds overly simplistic, that’s because it is. Actually, the proper
brewpot needs to conform to specific acceptable parameters, the fermenter
must be airtight and yet be able to vent carbon dioxide, and the bottles
require bottle caps, which in turn require a bottle-capping device. And your
list of needs has only begun.
You also want a number of smaller (but no less important) items that all
brewers need to have in their breweries. And as you may find out, brewers
who continue to brew beer are likely to continue to buy or build additional
time- and effort-saving equipment as they need it. This chapter discusses the
necessary equipment at all levels of homebrewing because more advanced
equipment is required to produce the more advanced beer styles found later
in the book.
Don’t panic — just follow along at your own pace. You don’t need to progress
to levels you’re not comfortable with. Although some brewers feel compelled
to advance as rapidly as possible, others find their niche and stick with it.
Above all else, homebrewing should be an enjoyable undertaking.

Sniffing Out Sources
The first step in your homebrewing expedition is to locate your local home-
brew supply retailer. I suggest that you start with the phone book; try looking
under “Hobbies” or “Beer.” Stop in at your local homebrew supply shop and
ask for a catalog and price list (if they have one). Take a look at the equip-
ment and supplies; ask questions about the stock — especially the ingredi-
ents. To the first-timer, the vast quantities of equipment and ingredient
choices can be somewhat intimidating.
You may find (as many people have) that you don’t have a local retailer in
your area, in which case mail order is the next best thing. Many mail-order
shops have toll-free phone numbers or Web sites for ordering, and most offer
free catalogs, many of which are both extensive and information-packed.
Homebrewing equipment varies, as shown in Figure 2-1, and any homebrew
supply shop worth its salt can get you just about anything you need or 
desire (for homebrewing, that is!)

Square One: Equipment for 
the Beginning Brewer
Square one generally denotes a starting point (although it’s also been used to
describe this author), and this section is no different: It serves as the starting
point in your homebrewing career. Before you can embark on this career
path, however, you need to buy the tools of the trade.
So much equipment, so little time . . .
For the benefit of beginning homebrewers, in this section I recommend and
discuss only the minimal amount of equipment needed; however, I may men-
tion additional convenient and time- and effort-saving pieces along the way.
Thrift is also a consideration; I typically recommend cheaper alternatives
over more expensive equipment and methods.
Many homebrew equipment suppliers sell prepackaged starter kits that can
range from the bare-bones to the top-of-the-line — all-inclusive starter kits
can run up to $200. All these kits include the basic equipment essentials, but
some kits also throw in books, videos, or other unnecessary items that just
inflate the price. Before you buy a kit, consider what you need and what you
want to spend. To help you get the wheels turning, Table 2-1 gives you a
starter list of necessary items and their approximate costs.
If you go high-end on all your equipment, your cost adds up to well over 
a couple hundred dollars, not including the cost of bottles (see the section
“What do I do with all these gadgets?” in this chapter for more information
about bottles and their cost). If you buy the smaller brewpot and a two-
handed capper to cut some corners, you can save about 25 bucks.

What do I do with all these gadgets?
Okay, you’ve read the list in Table 2-1 and made your own list of what equip-
ment you need. You’re ready to go shopping, right? Not so fast. You probably
want to understand a little bit about what it is you’re buying. The following
list gives you some insights into what all these gadgets do so you can be a
more informed consumer.
 Brewpot: Chances are you already have a large pot of some sort in your
kitchen, but if your brewpot is made of enamel-coated metal, make sure
it’s not chipped where it may come in contact with your beer. Your 
brewpot also needs to have a minimum 16-quart capacity, but I highly
recommend you go ahead and upgrade to the 20- or 30-quart pot listed
in Table 2-1.
The more of your wort you boil, the better for your finished beer. So,
when it comes to brewpots, the bigger the better.
 Brew spoon: Regardless of how well equipped your kitchen is, every
homebrewer needs to have a spoon dedicated for brewing beer and noth-
ing else. A brew spoon needs to be stainless steel or HDPE (food-grade)
20
Part I: First Things First 

plastic, and it needs to have a long handle — 18 inches or more. Avoid
wooden spoons because they can’t be kept thoroughly sanitized (and
they can splinter).
 Primary fermenter: The primary fermenter is where you pour the cooled
wort shortly after you’re done brewing. You must be able to seal this
vessel airtight for the duration of the fermentation. A primary fermenter
needs to have a minimum capacity of 7 gallons and an airtight lid with a
hole in it (to accommodate an airlock with an attached rubber stopper).
These specially made plastic fermenters come with removable plastic
spigots positioned near the bottom for easy use.
The kinds of plastics used in homebrewing are of the same quality and
standards as those plastics used in the food industry. In fact, another
name for HDPE (high-density polyethylene) is food-grade plastic. Unlike
lesser grades of plastic, HDPE restricts gaseous transfer through the
plastic (though not completely).
 Airlock: An airlock is an inexpensive (but incredibly simple and 
efficient) tool that allows the carbon dioxide gases to escape from the
fermenter during fermentation without compromising the antiseptic
environment within. Filled halfway with water, this setup lets gas escape
without allowing any air (and, therefore, germs) into the fermenter. 
A similar contraption, called a bubbler, is a two-chambered device that
works on the same principle. The difference is that you can easily 
clean and sanitize the inside of an airlock (unlike the totally enclosed
bubbler). Both mechanisms work equally well otherwise, but the 
airlock, shown in Figure 2-2, is my first choice.

21
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Beeraphernalia

 Drilled rubber stopper: You need a rubber stopper to fit over the stem
of the airlock or bubbler to act as a wedge when you insert the airlock
into the hole in the fermenter lid. These drilled stoppers come in num-
bered sizes (for example, a #3 stopper). Be sure you buy a stopper 
that fits the opening in your fermenter lid. (Your homebrew equipment
supplier can determine what you need.)
 Plastic hose: Flexible plastic hosing is a multifunctional piece of equip-
ment you use to transfer your beer from vessel to vessel or from vessel
to bottle. It’s an important part of your equipment package and one that
you need to always keep clean and undamaged. You want to have 3 to 5
feet of hosing.
 Bottling bucket: The bottling bucket is a vessel you need on bottling 
day. It doesn’t require a lid, but it’s considerably more efficient if you
buy a bucket with a removable spigot at the bottom. The bottling bucket
is also called a priming vessel because you prime your fermented beer
with corn sugar just prior to bottling. (I discuss the priming process in
detail in Chapter 13.)
 Glass bottles: Your bottles must be the thick, heavy, returnable kind.
Don’t use any bottle with a threaded (twist-off) opening — a bottle cap
doesn’t seal properly across the threads. You need enough bottles to
hold 5 gallons of beer: 54 12-ounce bottles, 40 16-ounce bottles, or any
combination of bottles that adds up to 640 ounces. You can buy brand-
new bottles from a homebrew supply shop, but you can get used 
bottles much more cheaply from commercial breweries.
Find out whether a local liquor store sells any beer in returnable bottles
(not the cheap recyclable kind). If it does, buy a couple of cases, drink
the beer, and voilà! You have 48 bottles (not to mention a swollen 
bladder and a nasty headache).
Another alternative, albeit an initially more expensive one, is to buy the
self-sealing swing-top bottles. See the sidebar “Swingtime” in Chapter 13
for more information.
 Bottling tube: A bottling tube is a hard plastic tube that’s about a foot
long and comes with a spring-loaded valve at the tip. You attach the bot-
tling tube to the plastic hosing (which you then attach to the spigot on
the bottling bucket) and insert the tube in the bottles when filling them.
 Bottle brush: A bottle brush is another inexpensive but important piece
of equipment. You need this soft-bristle brush to properly scrub the
inside of the bottles prior to filling.
 Bottle rinser: A bottle rinser is a curved plastic or brass apparatus that
you attach to a faucet. It works as an added convenience for rinsing 
bottles. This device isn’t an absolute necessity, but for the money it’s a
good investment.
22
Part I: First Things First 

If you buy a bottle rinser, take note of which faucet in your home you
plan to use. Utility faucets usually have larger hose threads and others,
such as bathroom and kitchen faucets, have fine threads where an
adapter may be needed. Make sure the bottle rinser and any adapters
have a rubber washer (gasket) in place.
 Bottle capper: You need a bottle capper to affix new bottle caps to the
filled bottles. These come in all shapes, sizes, and costs.
Most cappers work equally well, but I suggest that you choose a bench-
type capper, like the one shown in Figure 2-3, over the two-handed style.
A bench capper is free-standing and can be attached to a work surface
(permanently, if you like), which leaves one hand free to hold the 
bottle steady.
 Triple-scale hydrometer: A hydrometer is a fragile glass measuring
device used to calculate the density of your beer as well as the amount
of alcohol that the yeast has produced in your homebrew. Triple scale
refers to the three different measuring scales within the hydrometer (see
the sidebar “Of liquid density and hydrometers . . .” in this chapter).
Some people argue that a hydrometer isn’t a necessary piece of 
equipment at the beginner level. I disagree. A hydrometer isn’t very
expensive, it’s easy to use, and anyone who wants to progress in the
world of homebrewing needs to learn how to use one. Therefore, 
I recommend adding a hydrometer to your initial shopping list — 
and be sure to buy a plastic cylinder to go with it.

Part I: First Things First 
Of liquid density and hydrometers . . .
A hydrometer is a long, cylindrical, narrow glass
device designed to measure liquid density. It’s
weighted at the bottom and has a numeric scale
or scales inside for measuring purposes. With
the weighted end submerged in the liquid, the
calibrated stem projects out of the liquid; the
density of the liquid determines the height of
this projection.
A triple-scale hydrometer features three sepa-
rate scales. Two of them — the specific gravity
scale and the Balling scale — measure liquid
density (the density of liquids in relation to 
the density of water), but the third measures
potential alcohol. Ordinary water has a specific
gravity of 1.000 at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. (For
comparison’s sake, at the same temperature,
gasoline has a specific gravity around 0.66,
whole milk is about 1.028, and mercury is
13.600!)
The Balling scale performs the exact same
function as the specific gravity scale, except
that it reads in different incremental numbers
called degrees Plato. A homebrew with a spe-
cific gravity of 1.048 has a density of 12.5
degrees Plato. (The difference between these
two measurement scales is similar to the differ-
ence between the Fahrenheit and Celsius tem-
perature scales; homebrewers seem to prefer
the specific gravity scale.)
So, what’s the point? Measuring the density of
your brew accomplishes two goals: It tells you
when your brew is done fermenting (and thus,
when it’s time to bottle your beer), and it allows
you to calculate the alcohol potential of your
brew. Of course, potential alcohol and actual
alcohol are two different things, which is why
you need to take two different hydrometer read-
ings. Taking a hydrometer reading before you
ferment the wort gives you the original gravity;
it tells you the alcohol potential. Taking a second
hydrometer reading after fermentation is over
gives you the final gravity (also called terminal
gravity) and a final alcohol potential. Subtracting
the F.G. (final gravity) from the O.G. (original
gravity) on one scale and the final alcohol poten-
tial from the initial alcohol potential on the other
scale tells you, in mathematical terms, how
much of the sugar your yeast ate and how much
alcohol is in your brew.
When yeasts eat sugar they produce alcohol, so
any decrease in gravity results in a reciprocal
increase in alcohol.
A few things to remember:
 Although a hydrometer is a very reliable
method of measuring specific gravities and
figuring alcohol potentials, the readings
skew if the liquid temperature is not near 60
degrees Fahrenheit at reading time. Hot wort
readings are lower than they should be and
cold bottling readings are higher than they
should be due to the temperature-sensitive
nature of liquid density. Therefore, always
measure at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (or use a
temperature correction scale — ask your
homebrew retailer for details).
 Alcohol potential readings are measured in
alcohol by volume (ABV), not alcohol by
weight (ABW) (see Chapter 6).
 Surface tension in liquids causes something
called a meniscus effect. The tendency of
liquids to cling to other surfaces creates a
meniscus. The meniscus is the concave
appearance of the beer between the wall of
the cylinder and the exterior of the hydrom-
eter. Be sure to sight your reading at the
lowest point of the meniscus.
 A hydrometer, like the one shown in the
figure, can also call attention to possible 

Square Two: Equipment for the
Intermediate Brewer
Okay, you’ve mastered homebrewing techniques at the novice level and
you’re looking for a bigger challenge. Well, you’ve come to the right place.
This section is for the budding homebrewer who intends to get more 
personally involved in the brewing processes. A more hands-on approach 
to anything calls for more specialized equipment (a car owner intending to
do her own vehicle maintenance can’t get far without the right tools). A lot 
of different procedures await you at the intermediate level of homebrewing,
each with its own degree of difficulty (see Chapter 11).
Now what do I need?
The list of equipment in Table 2-2 is based on the additional needs of the
homebrewer who endeavors to try all of the procedures outlined in Chapter
11. Those brewers who aren’t compelled to try all the intermediate brewing
procedures need to pick and choose the items that best suit their needs and
levels of confidence. Figure 2-4 shows a couple of the more important items
you need.

fermentation problems. Average healthy
yeasts consume at least 65 percent of avail-
able sugars (usually more); if the final grav-
ity reading of your beer is not 35 percent or
less of the original gravity, a lot of sugar may
still be in the beer (see Chapter 10 for details
on taking hydrometer readings).

Part I: First Things First 

What do these gizmos even do?
New challenges in homebrewing often call for new equipment. Before you
take off on this new adventure, take a gander at the following list so you know
exactly what you need and why you need it.
 Glass carboy: Carboys are the large cylindrical jugs that water 
delivery companies used for years until they switched to the plastic 
carboys used today. Because plastic carboys aren’t really appropriate
for homebrewing use, you need to purchase a glass carboy from your
local homebrew supply store. The principal use for a glass carboy in
homebrewing is as a secondary fermenter, where you age and mature
your beer.
Carboys may come in 3- to 15-gallon capacities, but the 5-gallon size 
best matches the typical batch of homebrew; therefore, it’s probably 
the best choice for homebrewing purposes.
 Rubber stopper: If you intend to use the carboy as a fermenter, you
need another drilled rubber stopper to fit the carboy’s neck (usually 
a #6 or #7 stopper). As with the plastic primary fermenter, the carboy
needs to be sealed with an airlock while the beer inside is aging.
 Airlock: You may not actually need another airlock in the brewery, but
you may find you like to have a spare one around — besides, it costs
less than a couple of bucks!
Having a second airlock allows you to brew two batches in quick succes-
sion. While one batch is aging in the carboy, another can be fermenting
in the primary fermenter.
 Carboy brush: If you want to continue to use the carboy as a fermenter,
you need a carboy brush. This heavy-duty, soft-bristle brush is specially
designed to reach every curve and corner of the carboy during cleaning.
 Racking tube: Racking is the act of transferring beer from one vessel 
to another, or into bottles, while leaving yeast sediment and particulate
matter behind. Because carboys don’t offer the convenience of a spigot,
you need a hard-plastic, curved racking tube — also called a cane —
to siphon the beer out.
 Funnel: Because the opening of the carboy is so small, a good funnel is 
a handy thing to have around. I recommend one with an opening at least
8 inches in diameter.
 Kitchen strainer: With the addition of loose grain, hops, and other 
ingredients to your brewpot, a strainer with a handle becomes a neces-
sary piece of equipment. Food-grade steel mesh is better than plastic;
don’t settle for a strainer with a diameter of less than 10 inches or one
without a strong handle. You may have to go to a culinary specialty
store to find the right one.
27
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Beeraphernalia

 Sparge bags: Regardless of whether you have a strainer, sparge bags are
effective for steeping grain or keeping whole-leaf hops under control in
the brewpot. You can buy reusable nylon bags with drawstrings, or you
can buy the inexpensive throw-away kind.
 Lab immersion thermometer: Because temperature control becomes
more and more important in brewing at the intermediate level, you 
probably want to have an immersion thermometer in your brewery. A
lab-quality immersion thermometer is capable of temperature readings
above the boiling point (212 degrees Fahrenheit or100 degrees Celsius at
sea level) and as low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit (or 4.4 degrees Celsius).
 Grain mill: A grain mill is one of the more expensive items you need.
You use the grain mill to crack the grain prior to brewing with it. You can
buy precracked grain, but many homebrew stores don’t crack it prop-
erly (and precracked grain can also go stale more quickly). The mill-less
homebrewer can find inventive ways to crack the grain, such as putting
it into a large sealable plastic bag and rolling it with a rolling pin or 
baseball bat.
Whatever you do, don’t use a coffee grinder to do your grain milling. 
If you do, your grain ends up looking like sawdust — and how it looks 
is just the beginning of your problems. Grinding your grain too finely
causes your beer to have an unpleasant, bitter, astringent taste.
 Kitchen or postal scale: After you start to brew beer according 
to specific recipes, you may find that you need many ingredients in
small quantities. A good kitchen or postal scale is vital to getting these
quantities just right because it can measure fractions of ounces.
Square Three: Equipment 
for the Advanced Brewer
Some homebrewers become so completely engrossed and absorbed 
in their hobby that their craving for homebrewing information is only 
surpassed by their need to take full control of the brewing processes they
perform. Welcome to the world of advanced homebrewing (also known as
homebrewing geekdom).
What separates this level of homebrewing from the intermediate level
(besides this mania) is that you produce wort from grain only — just like 
the commercial brewers make beer. To do so, you must master the process
known as mashing. Mashing is the method of producing your wort from raw
grain instead of using malt syrup. (See Chapter 12 for more on mashing.) And
even though the learning curve is pretty steep, mashing allows you to make
cheaper and potentially more-flavorful beer.
28
Part I: First Things First 

I need even more stuff?
As you progress even farther up the homebrewing evolutionary ladder, 
you need to obtain the proper equipment for your brewing needs. Table 2-3
shows you the additional items that are necessary to perform the brewing
procedures outlined in the advanced brewing chapter (Chapter 12). You may
have already purchased some of these items for the intermediate level of
brewing, which means you’re ahead of the game. If you kept your wallet close
to your hip at the beginner and intermediate levels, here’s where the cost is
gonna catch up to you.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Beeraphernalia

What else could I possibly 
need another doodad for?
Okay, you’ve handled all the intermediate homebrewing procedures with
ease. Now you really want to brew beer like the pros, but you need the 
equipment that helps you do that. Study this list (and double-check the 
balances on your credit cards).
Check out Chapter 26 to find out how to make many of these items 
inexpensively. Chapter 12 discusses many of these items and processes 
in greater depth.
 Large-volume brewpot: Because all-grain brewing requires you to 
boil the entire volume of beer, you need a brewpot that is large enough
to hold 7 gallons or more of wort (which eventually boils down to 5 
gallons) with room to spare at the top. Purchased new, this item can be 
a major expense. Check local garage sales and thrift stores. You can also
find cheaper, large-volume ceramic-lined pots from other equipment
sources (or simply make the brewpot yourself by following the 
directions in Chapter 26).
 Mashing brewpot (12-20 quarts): If you already have a smaller brewpot
left from your beginner days, that’s all you need here.
 Lauter tun: A lauter tun is a fairly simple device that allows you to drain
the wort away from the grain after the mashing process. It basically acts
as a large-volume strainer or colander. See Chapter 26 for instructions
on building your own lauter tun.
 Stock pot (4-8 quarts): You use this pot to heat water for sparging 
purposes. Sparging is pouring hot water through the bed of grain in your
lauter tun to recapture all the malt sugars still contained within it. You
can use any household pot capable of holding this volume of water.
 Immersion wort chiller: An immersion wort chiller is basically a coil 
of 3⁄8- to 1⁄2-inch copper tubing with a fitting on one end that connects to a
water source. As the coil is immersed in the hot wort, cold water flowing
through the tubing removes the heat by thermal conductivity. The hot
water flowing out the opposite end can be recaptured and used for 
various purposes. Check out Chapter 26 for information on building an
immersion wort chiller.
 pH papers: These disposable test papers are absolutely necessary for
the mashing processes described in the advanced brewing chapter. 
pH papers measure the acidity and alkalinity of your water. Simply dip
the test strip into your wort for about one minute and then compare 
the strip to the color comparison chart. (See Figure 2-5.)
Always work in good lighting when testing pH.
30
Part I: First Things First 

 Lab immersion thermometer: An important piece of equipment at the
intermediate level, this thermometer is absolutely necessary for the
mashing procedures in all-grain brewing.
 Grain mill: Unless you want to continue to rely on other people to grind
your grain for you (and often charge you for the service) or whack an
enormous amount of grain yourself with a rolling pin, you want to invest
in a good grain mill. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
 Kitchen or postal scale: A good scale is absolutely necessary at this
brewing level. You may opt to buy a scale at a culinary specialty store.
Check out Table 2-2 for pricing information.
 Gypsum: Along with calcium carbonate and calcium chloride, you may
need gypsum to adjust the pH of your water. You can use gypsum to 
simulate the gypsum-laden water of Burton-on-Trent, but it only lowers
pH when mashed with grain. For more information on the unique 
brewing water of Burton-on-Trent, see Chapter 7.
 Calcium carbonate: Calcium carbonate raises pH. You can also use it to
simulate the water sources of classic stouts and porters.
 Calcium chloride: You can use calcium chloride in place of gypsum to
lower pH without increasing the sulfate level in the water. It also works
in place of salt (sodium chloride) to add chlorides without increasing
the sodium content of the water.
With the addition of all these new and larger pieces of equipment to your 
collection, your kitchen is likely to become a lot more cluttered on brewing
day. And in order to get a large-volume brewpot up to a rolling boil, you’re
also probably going to want increased burner output and heating capacity.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Beeraphernalia

For these reasons (and others), many advanced brewers have moved 
their brewing operations into their basements, garages, and utility rooms
(and some of their spouses have moved to new addresses). Although this
expansion idea has merit, never overlook the safety considerations of such 
a move — have you ever tried to explain homebrewing procedures to an
insurance claims adjuster?
32
Part I: First Things First 
Chillin’ out
Because the advanced level of homebrewing
involves full-wort boils (boiling the entire batch
of wort at once), it’s imperative that you’re able
to cool 5 gallons of wort down quickly — cold
water baths in your kitchen sink just don’t cut it
anymore.
Although the immersion-type wort chiller listed
in Table 2-3 is a dandy (and highly recommended)
piece of equipment, the gadget-freak homebrew
geek can find another, more efficient wort-
chilling device. It’s called a counter-flow wort
chiller, and it’s more like the chillers commercial
breweries use. At the homebrewing level, a
counter-flow chiller consists of a copper tube
(much like the immersion-type wort chiller)
inserted into a rubber hose. While the hot wort
runs through the copper tubing in one direction,
cold water runs through the hose in the other
direction. This process cools the wort very
rapidly while allowing the brewer to recapture
the hot water flowing out the end of the hose for
future use.

 Keeping those beer-swilling fungi and bacteria at bay
 Determining the best cleaning agents for your equipment
 Cleaning and sanitizing your equipment
S
o you have all your brewing equipment, and now you’re ready to brew,
right? Not so fast, rookie.
Anyone who intends to become a proficient brewer of good beer must 
properly clean and sanitize all brewing equipment first. You can find out
about sanitation techniques in several different ways. You can read about
sanitizing, ask other brewers sanitation questions, and experiment with 
sanitizers on your own. Or — I guarantee — you can find out about them 
by accident. Contaminating a batch of beer out of carelessness is a painful
lesson to endure. The only fate worse than throwing out 5 gallons of bad 
beer is drinking 5 gallons of bad beer (hiccup) — especially after you’ve
spent your time and effort bottling it all. In this chapter, I explore the 
different levels of cleanliness required by brewing and give you information
on the products and practices that can help you meet those standards. 
I also discuss the nasty little vermin these practices help you fight.
No Dirty Words: Sanitation Lingo
Scrupulously clean brewing equipment and a pristine brewing environment
are the keys to making good beer. And by clean, I don’t mean just soap-and-
water clean. In homebrewing, serious sanitation is necessary.
Take a closer look at a few important words used in this chapter. Clean, as it
pertains to homebrewing, means that you’ve removed all dust, dirt, scum,
stains, and other visible contaminants from your brewing equipment and 

bottles to the best of your ability. After the visible contaminants are history,
you need to sanitize your equipment and bottles; sanitation is the elimination
of invisible contaminants (bacteria and other microorganisms) that can ruin
your brew. Clean requires a little elbow grease; sanitized requires chemicals.
Never assume that clean equipment is sanitized, and never assume sanitized
equipment is clean. For the good of your beer, practice good cleaning and
sanitizing techniques — in that order.
A third and equally important word is sterilize. Sterilization is another
method of germ-killing accomplished with very high temperatures (over 200
degrees Fahrenheit). Boiling your wort for at least an hour is an effective way
of sterilizing the ingredients in your beer. After your wort cools, however, 
air-borne, water-borne, and human-borne germs can easily recontaminate it.
For this reason, clean and sanitized equipment is imperative. From the 
boiling point forward, you need to treat your wort like a person without an
immune system — safeguarded from the bacterial world.
Battling Bacteria (and Fungi)
Nothing is more important to your production of clean, drinkable, and enjoy-
able beer than utilizing proper sanitizing procedures prior to your brewing.
You must sanitize or sterilize anything and everything that will come into
contact with your beer at any time.
“What’s the big deal?” you may ask. Well, millions of hungry microbes just
love to make meals of freshly brewed beer. These microbes are in your home,
on your body, and even in the air you breathe (cough, wheeze). Bacteria and
fungi are the forms of microbes that you need to be wary of — they’re both
opportunistic, and if you let them have their way with your brew, they do so
(always with negative results). Beer that bacteria has contaminated smells
and tastes awful.
Ironically, certain bacteria and fungi work for the betterment of beer, but only
under strict control. Because the classification fungi consists of mold spores
and wild yeast, beer yeast actually falls into the fungus category. However,
beer yeasts are of the friendly, laboratory-controlled variety. A couple of
strains of bacteria also show up in beer (intentionally), but mostly in specific
Belgian specialty beers that are still fermented in microbe–harboring, oak 
fermentation vessels.
Fungi and bacteria thrive in very warm temperatures — up to 120 degrees
Fahrenheit. The activity of these microbes does tend to decrease as the 
temperature drops, which is why cooling down your hot wort as quickly as
possible is imperative (as further described in Chapter 10). The cooler, 
the better.
34
Part I: First Things First 

So, how can you get rid of these little beer-ruining pests? Well, in truth, you
can’t really get rid of them completely; the idea is to keep them away from
your beer (or at least minimize their effect). I provide the following helpful
tips to assist you in deterring these foes:
 Keep your brewery (kitchen, laundry room, basement, or wherever you
make your beer) as clean and dust-free as possible.
 Quarantine all furry, four-legged family pets in another part of the house
while you brew or bottle your beer.
 Consider every cough and sneeze a threat to your beer.
 Finally, treat your equipment well. Clean and sanitize it properly prior 
to brewing, rinse it well, and dry it off after every use and before storing
it away. Keep your equipment stored in a dust- and mildew-free location
if at all possible. You may even want to go as far as sealing all your
equipment in large-capacity garbage bags between brewing sessions.
Soaps for Suds: Cleansers and Sanitizers
The variety of chemicals that you can use to clean and sanitize your home-
brewing equipment includes iodine-based products, chlorine-based products,
caustics (which can burn your skin), ammonia, and a couple of environmen-
tally safe cleansers that contain oxygen-based percarbonates. The following
bits of information are some pros and cons to the use of these various 
chemicals:
 Ammonia is good for cleaning bottles in a dilution of 1 cup of ammonia
to 5 gallons of water — if you can stand the pungent odor. If you use
ammonia for sanitizing, be sure to give your equipment a thorough 
hot-water rinse. Also, make sure to avoid prolonged exposure to ammo-
nia fumes, and wear gloves if you have sensitive skin. Goggles are also 
a good idea.
35
Chapter 3: Creating Your Own Department of Sanitation
No pathos for pathogens
Because freshly brewed beer is warm and
sweet, it’s the perfect breeding ground for micro-
biological opportunists. However, none of the
bacteria that grow in beer are even remotely as
harmful as the bacteria found in raw eggs, fish,
or uncooked meat that cause people to become
deathly ill. The germs that breed in beer are just
free-loading little buggers that make your beer
taste bad. Beer germs can’t kill you, but throw-
ing out a batch of brew just may.

 Chlorine is an ingredient in simple household bleach, which is very
effective and cost-efficient for cleaning homebrewing equipment. One
ounce of bleach per gallon of water is sufficient, which makes a gallon of
generic bleach an incredibly good deal. Be sure to buy unscented bleach
and to rinse all equipment thoroughly with hot water. An exception:
Chlorine bleach can corrode stainless steel brewing equipment, so avoid
using bleach for these items if you can. If bleach is your only option, see
Chapter 14 for more on this issue.
Never mix ammonia with chlorine bleach; this combination releases
toxic chlorine gas.
 Iodine-based sanitizers are popular in the medical field and the restau-
rant and commercial brewing industries as a disinfectant. You can 
apply iodine’s disinfectant properties to homebrewing, but note that it
stains plastics as well as human skin. Although iodine-based products
may vary in strength, the typical dilution ratio is 1 ounce of iodine per 
5 gallons of water. Iodine-based products are also FDA-approved as 
no-rinse sanitizers.
 Lye is a caustic that you want to use only to remove the most stubborn
stains and obstinate organic material from bottles or glass carboys.
Technically, caustics are cleansers and not sanitizers. However, most
small concentrations of caustic material dissolve and kill almost any
bacteria and organic buildup. If you use lye, make sure that you always
wear protective gear, such as goggles and rubber gloves.
 Percarbonates accomplish their cleaning activity with oxygen mole-
cules; they produce oxygen bubbles and help to loosen soils. Because 
of this unique cleaning method, sanitizers that work with percarbonates,
such as One Step, don’t require rinsing.
 Sodium metabisulphite is another food-grade sanitizer that doesn’t
require rinsing. A 4-ounce-to-1-gallon dilution is a standard mixture, 
but at about $2 per 4 ounces, a 5-gallon solution runs you ten bucks!
 TSP (trisodium phosphate) is a safe and effective nonsudsing powdered
cleanser good for cleaning beer bottles, glass carboys, and even glasses
used for beer drinking. TSP is not a sanitizer, however, and thorough
rinsing is imperative. Also, because TSP is a skin and eye irritant, always
wear protective gear when you use this cleanser.
Several brand-name sanitizers, including B-T-F Iodophor, Star San, Saniclean,
One Step, PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash) and B-Brite, along with generic
sodium metabisulphite, are available through homebrew supply stores. TSP,
ammonia, and chlorine bleach can be purchased at your local grocery and/or
hardware stores. The capacity of these products to sanitize homebrewing
equipment is directly proportionate to the way in which you use them; in
other words, if you don’t follow instructions, don’t blame the manufacturer
for a blown batch of beer.
36
Part I: First Things First 

Dilution rates and contact time are important variables to consider when
cleaning and sanitizing. Read all product instructions before using.
For my money, ordinary unscented household bleach is still the best bet.
Cleaning Up Your Act: Equipment
Cleaning Practices
The most effective methods of sanitizing involve soaking rather than inten-
sive scrubbing. For this purpose, the best place to handle sanitizing proce-
dures is a utility basin or large-capacity sink. (A bathtub can do in a pinch,
but bathtubs often harbor tons of bacteria, soap residues, and, occasionally,
small children. Remove all these potential contaminants prior to use — espe-
cially the wee ones.) Remember that chlorine can wreak havoc on stainless
steel; if you’re sanitizing with bleach, make sure your bleach and basin are
compatible.
Never use any abrasives or materials that can scratch your plastic or metal
equipment, because pits and scratches are excellent hiding places for those
wily bacteria. Using a very soft sponge that you’ve devoted to cleaning only
homebrew equipment is a good idea.
Okay, so now that you’re ready to begin sanitizing, follow these instructions:
1. Place the items you want to sanitize in the plugged utility basin and
begin drawing cold water into the basin.
Because chlorine is volatile, don’t use hot water with bleach; the heat of
the water causes the chlorine gas to leave the water much more quickly.
If you’re sanitizing the fermenter, carboy, or bottling bucket, you need to
fill only those items rather than the whole basin or sink. You can place
smaller items in the sanitizing solution within these larger items.
However, for bottles, you need to fill the entire sink.
2. As the water runs, add cleansing/sanitizing chemicals according to
package directions, or pour in 1 ounce of unscented household bleach
per gallon of water.
3. Completely immerse all the items you want to sanitize in the sanitiz-
ing solution.
Don’t forget to include the fermenter lid, which you have to force into
the fermenter sideways. Always allow 30 minutes for all bottles and
equipment to soak.
37
Chapter 3: Creating Your Own Department of Sanitation

4. After 30 minutes, remove your equipment and thoroughly rinse the
various pieces in hot water.
5. Sanitize the spigots on the fermenter and bottling bucket by draining
the sanitizing solution through each spigot.
6. Allow everything to air dry.
The fermenter lid, placed upside down on a clean surface, is a good
place to dry the smaller sanitized items.
In spite of all your hard work, you may still occasionally end up with a batch
of contaminated beer — how and by what you may never know. That’s why
attention to detail is so important.
Bottle Cleanliness Is a Virtue
When you’re absolutely sure that your brew is bottle-ready (you can verify
this decision with a hydrometer reading — see Chapter 2), you need to 
clean and sanitize your bottles. You can clean your bottles pretty much at
your convenience if you store them properly, but sanitizing your bottles too
far ahead of time may lead to bacterial recontamination.
Using a dishwasher with a dry cycle is a convenient way of cleaning bottles
(be sure you load the bottles into the dishwasher upside down). This 
practice does not relieve you from your bottle-sanitizing duties.
To sanitize your bottles, follow these steps:
1. Fill the entire basin or sink with water and sanitizer (per package
instructions).
Of course, exactly how much water you need to add depends on the
capacity of the utility basin or sink — and don’t forget to adjust the
volume of sanitizing chemical to the volume of water (I give you some
guidelines in the “Soaps for Suds” section, but always read the label on
your particular sanitizer). You need enough water to immerse at least 
54 12-ounce bottles. Again, add cleansing/sanitizing chemicals according
to package directions, or pour in the proper amount of unscented 
household bleach (1 ounce per gallon of water).
2. As you immerse the bottles, make sure the sanitizing solution fills
each one, with no pockets of air left in them.
3. Allow the bottles to soak for 30 minutes (or according to the sanitizer’s
package directions).
4. After 30 minutes, affix the bottle rinser to the faucet (you may have to
use an adapter) and turn on the hot water.
38
Part I: First Things First 

Don’t worry about water spraying everywhere; the bottle rinser is
designed to hold back the water pressure until you slip a bottle over the
opening and apply downward pressure.
5. Clean the bottles one by one with the bottle brush while the sanitizing
solution is still in them.
6. Drain the sanitizing solution from each bottle, rinse each bottle twice
with the bottle rinser, and allow the bottles to air-dry.
One stumble into several dozen free-standing bottles can make for a
doozy of a breakable mess. Put your cleaned bottles back into 6-pack
holders or cardboard cases to prevent accidental catastrophes.
Don’t forget that you also need to sanitize your bottle caps before using
them. Boil them for 10 minutes in a small pot of water on your stove top. If
you’re using the oxygen-barrier type of bottle cap, however, you should soak
them in a percarbonate or iodine-based solution for the same amount of time.
Boiling this type of cap reduces its ability to absorb oxygen.

our basic building blocks make beer — barley (malt),
hops, yeast, and water. I devote one chapter in this
part to each one of these important primary ingredients. I
add another two chapters to discuss all the miscellaneous
additives and ﬂavorings that aren’t primary ingredients 
in beer.

 Extracting malt
 Comparing and contrasting malt extracts
T
he word malt generally refers to the natural maltose sugars derived 
from certain grains (mainly barley) that eventually become beer. At the
commercial brewing level, as well as the advanced homebrewing level, 
brewers produce beer through procedures that create and capture the malt
sugars from the grain. At the beginner and intermediate levels of homebrew-
ing, however, a commercially produced malt syrup that homebrewers can
easily use to make beer at home eliminates the need for these procedures.
In this chapter, I look at the different types of grains used in brewing as well
as the processes the grain undergoes to become brew-ready. I also explore
the shortcuts available in the form of malt extract and compare and contrast
its two forms: dry and liquid.
Going with Grain
Of the four main ingredients used to make beer (barley, hops, yeast, and
water), barley — really, grain in general — makes the biggest contribution.
It’s responsible for giving beer its color, its underlying flavor, its sweetness,
its body, its head of foam, and its mouthfeel (or the textural qualities of beer
on your palate and in your throat — viscosity, or thickness; carbonation; 
alcohol warmth; and so on). Grains also contribute the natural sugars that
feed the yeast, which in turn converts the sugars into alcohol and carbon
dioxide during fermentation.

For as long as humans have been making beer, they’ve experimented with all
different kinds of cereal grains for beermaking purposes. Wherever grains
grew uncultivated, the indigenous peoples made a beer-like beverage from
them: wheat in Mesopotamia, barley in Egypt, millet in Africa, rice in Asia,
and corn in the Americas.
Cereal grains are the same ones that are puffed, popped, pulverized, and
poured into the colorful boxes of breakfast cereal that line your grocer’s
shelves: corn flakes, Rice Krispies, Wheat Chex, oatmeal. Name any cereal
grain, and you can bet someone has tried to put it in beer. One grain that isn’t
very popular at the breakfast table is the one that works best for making
beer: barley. (It works pretty well in soup, too.)
Barley grows in two major strains: 6-row barley and 2-row barley. These
names refer to the number of rows of barley kernels visible when you look
down from the top of the stalk. 2-row barley generally goes into Ales, and 6-
row barley generally goes into Lagers (but these aren’t hard-and-fast rules).
Malting
Before you can brew with barley, it must undergo a process known as malting.
The malting process, simply put, simulates the grain’s natural germination
cycle. (Who says it’s not nice to fool Mother Nature?) Under closely moni-
tored conditions, malting companies wet the barley kernels and allow them
to sprout. As the seedlings begin sprouting, the starchy insides of the kernels
(or endosperm) begin to change. This modification causes the hard, starchy
endosperm to begin to break down into natural malt sugars (maltose) that
brewers later liquefy, during the mashing process. (See the “Mashing” section
in this chapter for details on this process.) One of the most important 
features of this process is the production of the enzymes brewers later use 
in the mashing process. And the maltose sugars, along with proteins and 
dextrins, contribute the aforementioned color, flavor, sweetness, body,
mouthfeel, and foam in the beer.
Only after the barley has undergone the malting process does it become malt,
or barleymalt.
Malted barley is an incredibly complete and convenient package, seemingly
designed exclusively for brewing beer. Each grain kernel contains carbohy-
drates (which eventually convert to sugar), enzymes (which do the actual
converting), proteins (which provide yeast nutrition, mouthfeel, and head sta-
bility), and a husk (which, when multiplied by thousands, acts as the perfect
natural filter bed through which you can drain the unfermented beer).
Very few commercial brewers — usually only the huge beer factories — 
do their own malting. Professional malting companies (also called maltsters)
malt most of the grain for the brewing industry (including smaller 
commercial brewers and homebrew supply shops).
44
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Mashing
In order to make beer from the malted grain, the starch within the kernels 
of malt must be made soluble. This liquefying process takes place during the
mashing procedures in a vessel called a mash tun. The mashing process is
where the natural enzymes found in grain break down the grain’s starches;
hot water then dissolves the starches so they leech out of the cracked 
grain. After you’ve rinsed all the malt sugars from the grain, you transfer the
syrupy-sweet malt tea, called wort, over to the brew kettle, where you boil 
it. (For more on mashing, see Chapter 12.) Homebrewers who make their
beer with malt extract can avoid the mashing process altogether.
Wort (rhymes with dirt) is the German word for unfermented beer. Some
brewers also call wort green beer (and not just on St. Patrick’s Day).
Mixing it up with other grains
Although barley is the best base grain for brewing, it’s by no means your only
option. You can enhance the flavor of barleymalt in beer with specialty grains
or substitute the barley with adjunct grains. The following list details the
characteristics of these different types of grains:
 Base malted grain is the main source of fermentable sugars and the
body and flavor of the beer. Base grain must undergo modification
during malting; make sure it’s fully mashed before brewing with it. Most
commercial beer recipes and many all-grain homebrew recipes call for
more than one type of base grain.
 Specialty grains allow the brewer to add all kinds of colors, flavors, and
textures to beer, therefore providing a variety of visual, aromatic, and
taste enhancements. Also, specialty grains may contribute dextrins and
head-retaining and body-building proteins (the beer’s body, not yours).
These grains create complexity in beer (and perplexity in the beer
critic). Most specialty grains don’t require mashing because they don’t
add significant amounts of fermentable sugars to the wort. Simply put,
without the use of specialty grains, very few distinctive beer styles
would exist.
In a 5-gallon batch, which typically starts with about 10 pounds of 
grain, you don’t need much specialty grain to lend a noticeable effect.
Depending on the grain type, quantities of as little as 1⁄4 of a pound are
detectable in the finished beer.
 Adjunct grains are unmalted cereal grains that still add fermentable
sugars to the wort (as well as some underlying flavor). Adjunct grains,
such as corn and rice, are popular for fiscal reasons; they’re used in
place of the more expensive barleymalt. They’re also used to dilute
flavor and make lighter-bodied beers.
45
Chapter 4: Malt: A Tale of Two Sources (Grain and Extract)

Corn and rice aren’t malted like barley, so brewers must cook them in a
cereal cooker to gelatinize the starchy interior of the grain in order for
the brewer to extract their sugars. Gelatinization is a softening of the
hard grain kernel. Although corn and rice aren’t popular with homebrew-
ers, those who do use these grains must also gelatinize them by cooking
them on the stove-top before adding them to the mash.
For more specific information on particular grain types, consult the 
appendix.
A few specialty grain types aren’t malted but still undergo mashing proce-
dures (because throwing these unmalted specialty grains in with the rest of
the malted grains in the mash tun is the only logical time and place to add
them to the beer). These unmalted specialty grains include roasted barley,
raw wheat, and raw oats, among others, and are used for flavoring and tex-
ture purposes, not for adding fermentable sugars. Intermediate and advanced
homebrewers can easily add uniqueness to their brews by simply adding 
specialty grains to their mashing vessel.
Manipulating grain: Kilning and milling
In addition to these grains, you can also manipulate malted barley in a variety
of ways to create unique specialty malts. Kilning, or roasting the grain to vari-
ous degrees, is one way of achieving this variety. Depending on the degree of
roasting, specialty grains imbue beer with a broad palette of earth-toned
colors, and their flavor contributions range from caramelly to chocolatey to
roasty to smoky. Milling is the process of cracking the grain husk to allow
access to the natural sugars contained within the kernel (also called 
cracking).
Don’t mill highly kilned grains such as roasted barley and black malt.
Because they’re quite brittle, they have a tendency to crumble during the
milling process, creating a fine, dark grain powder that adds harshness to
your beer.
Homebrew recipes usually call out specialty grains by the pound or in incre-
ments of a pound. In the absence of a kitchen or postal scale, you can mea-
sure specialty grains with relative accuracy by using a measuring cup.
For conversion purposes, 1 cup of milled grain equals approximately 1⁄4 pound,
ergo, 4 cups equal 1 pound.
46
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Enjoying the Ease of Extracts
Fortunately for homebrewers (particularly novices), they can make beer
much more easily, without having to deal with grains. (It sounds too good 
to be true, doesn’t it?) The same companies that malt the raw grain for the
brewing industry have also figured out a way to make a product homebrew-
ers can rehydrate to reproduce the wort you get by mashing malted grain.
These companies market the product as malt extract, and it’s been nothing
less than a boon to the homebrewing industry (some professional brewers
use it, too).
The Pacific Coast Brewing Company in Oakland, California, has won several
medals at the Great American Beer Festival for its malt-extract-based beers.
Malt extract (also called malt syrup) is a premade, premeasured beer 
concentrate. Malt extract starts out as wort produced from grain that is then
dehydrated to the point that it contains as little as 20 percent water content.
Basically, all you need to do is add malt extract to water and boil it. I may 
be oversimplifying the process just a tad, but all-inclusive malt extract kits
are just about that easy. The hardest part of the brewing process is often
deciding which kit to buy — check out the appendix for brand names. (I give
plenty of extract-based beer recipes in Part IV.) For more on brewing with a
kit, take a look at Chapter 10.
These concentrated malt extracts usually come premeasured (in pounds or
kilograms) in cans or heavy-duty plastic bags. The typical can of malt extract
weighs 3.3 or 6.6 pounds, and these extracts are available in most of the rec-
ognized beer styles. Malt extract can imbue your homebrew with all the malt
flavor, sweetness, body, and mouthfeel you’d get if you made it from grain.

Chapter 4: Malt: A Tale of Two Sources (Grain and Extract)
To add-junk or not to add-junk?
Although enhancing a beer’s malt character with
specialty grain is perfectly acceptable, many
purists (this author included) shy away from sub-
stituting barleymalt with adjunct grain. One way
to enhance the barley character of a beer is by
adding rye to the recipe, which gives the beer a
distinctive rye flavor. The most obvious examples
of brewers substituting barley with adjuncts
occur at the big corporate brewhouses, where
they replace the rich malt character of barley
with lighter and cheaper adjunct grains like corn
and rice (much to the delight of millions of obliv-
ious beer drinkers).

For full body and flavor, use two 3.3-pound cans to make one full batch 
of beer (5 gallons), or no less than 1 pound of extract per gallon of water 
(1 pound of extract per gallon of water results in a beer with a specific gravity
of 1.040; 6.6 pounds in a 5-gallon batch results in a specific gravity of 1.052).
The rather odd (by U.S. standards) measure of 3.3 pounds was set by the
British, who pioneered the malt-extract-producing industry. The majority of
kits initially sold in the U.S. were from the U.K., where 3.3 pounds is 1.5 
kilograms (the standard can size).

Lovibonds to love and SRMs, 
EBCs, and HCUs 4 U 2 C
All of the various maltsters who malt the grain for
the American brewing industry produce it in
much the same way. One of the industry stan-
dards they follow is the production of kilned
grains according to a color scale called the
Lovibond scale. Actually, the Lovibond method of
color measurement can be applied to wort, malt
extract, and beer as well, but these qualities all
trace their roots back to the malt-house.
Because you can more easily see differences in
color depth than describe them accurately, the
Lovibond scale designates a specific number to
each specific color depth. Each of the specialty
grains on the upcoming list has its own degree
on the Lovibond scale (though Lovibond can be
abbreviated as L, most packages and recipes
just use the number without the L). Here are
those numbers, including some base malts for
comparison:
 Pale Lager
1.6
 Pale Ale
1.8
 Vienna
3
 Munich (light)
10
 Munich (dark)
20
 Crystal
20–120
 Chocolate
350
 Black Patent
500+
 Roasted barley
500+
A more updated color scale for beer is the
American standard of color measurement — the
SRM (Standard Reference Method) scale. It
closely approximates the older Lovibond scale,
with the main difference being that the SRM
scale is much more accurate because it relies on
a spectrophotometer (an instrument used to
measure the absorbance of light — and no, you
don’t need to buy one) to do the measuring. The
Lovibond scale, on the other hand, relies on the
human eye to discern color depths compared to
tinted glass filters.
And just to further complicate matters, home-
brewers have their own color scale called HCU,
or Homebrew Color Units. This crude method of
establishing beer color relies on a simple for-
mula: Take the weight in pounds of each type of
grain used, multiply each by its corresponding
degrees Lovibond, add all of these multiplied
numbers together, and divide by the total number
of gallons in the batch of beer. Honestly, I don’t
know anyone who uses this method, but you
can’t say I didn’t tell you about it.
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Kits are all-inclusive setups that include a prehopped malt extract (an extract
that already has the hop bitterness added to it) and a packet of yeast to
match the style of beer listed on the can’s exterior. These kits come in a 
variety of colors and flavors and are clearly labeled according to the style of
beer they produce. I recommend these kits for all first-time homebrewers. 
Be aware, however, that not all extracts are the same quality. Cheaper malt
extracts often add sugar (read the labels). For better-tasting brews, pay a
little extra and buy top-quality all-malt extracts — you’ll be glad you did.
Also, don’t follow any directions provided with cans of extract that recom-
mend adding sugar to the brew. Just follow the brewing guidelines in 
Chapter 10.
Graduating to other malty methods
Although homebrew kits specify the particular beer styles they’re ideal for,
they can also be somewhat confining in this respect. Homebrewers who rely
on the kit-maker to reproduce true beer styles may decide at some point to
take more personal control of the situation. Graduating into the realm of
extract brewing without a kit requires the brewer to separately buy and add
whatever ingredients don’t come with the can of extract: The hops, yeast,
and whatever specialty grains the recipe calls for. (I cover the details on how
to work with these various ingredients in Chapter 11.)
When a homebrewer has enough confidence to take this leap on his own, he’s
maltriculated (okay, graduated) to the intermediate level of homebrewing.
49
Chapter 4: Malt: A Tale of Two Sources (Grain and Extract)
Thick as a brix
Malt extract manufacturers use heat and/or
vacuum power to remove moisture from the
wort, which concentrates the wort into an
extract. How much water they remove deter-
mines the extract’s viscosity, and the percentage
of remaining solids determines the brix. The brix
scale provides a number that correlates to the
amount of sugar (solids) found in a 100-pound
sample. Most malt extracts range between 70
and 80 brix.
From an economic standpoint, it makes more
sense to buy the most concentrated extract
available — those with the highest brix rating. To
make this point clearer, 31⁄2 pounds of 80 brix
extract contain as much fermentable sugar as 4
pounds of 70 brix extract. Unfortunately, not all
malt extract manufacturers disclose this infor-
mation on the product labels, so you may have to
ask your retailer.
Also, be aware that extracts with high brix 
ratings may be unsuitable for making pale beers
because the extra heat needed to concentrate
the wort usually results in darker and more
caramelly malt extracts.

I always encourage intermediate homebrewers to start with the palest base
extract available because they’re the most neutral-tasting and allow the most
flexibility. You can always add dark color and additional flavor to a beer by
using specialty grains.
Comparing liquid versus dry malt extract
Malt extract comes in two distinct forms. One is liquid, which is quite thick
and viscous, and the other is dry, which is a rather sticky powder. These two
forms share similarities that far outnumber their differences. Actually, the
main distinction between liquid and dry extracts is that dry malt extract
(DME in homebrewer lingo) has been spray-dried to remove up to 99 percent
of its moisture content.
Convenience is also a benefit of working with DME: Though it can get sticky 
if it contacts water, steam, or humid air, it’s nowhere near as messy as liquid
extract. You can effortlessly and accurately measure DME with little cleanup
required. The storage factor can also come into play. Just like bread, liquid
extract can grow mold when exposed to air, so you need to use opened cans
as soon as possible. DME, because of its minuscule moisture content, can
simply be refrigerated in self-sealing plastic bags. Dry extract is also a great
convenience to those who practice the yeast-propagating techniques I dis-
cuss in Chapters 6 and 12.
Unopened cans of liquid extract have a fairly long shelf-life. They may be
usable for up to two to four years, but as with most consumables, the fresher
they are, the better for your beer (and don’t even think of using malt extract
from a can that’s bulging at the seams). Six to eight months is the generally
accepted window of freshness. Dry malt extract has a much longer shelf-life;
if you keep it sealed and refrigerated, DME can last almost indefinitely.
I need to point out that, for all its usefulness, DME has its disadvantages. It’s
not packaged according to any particular style; it’s just sold in light, amber,
dark, and wheat variations. You also pay for its convenience; because of the
extra processing required to produce it, DME is more expensive than liquid
extract. Of course, you’re also getting more bang for your buck (because of
the lower water content in DME), which brings up another good point:
Because of the difference in water content, using dry extract in place of liquid
extract affects your gravity readings in a side-by-side, pound-for-pound 
comparison. This difference adds up to about one specific gravity degree per
pound, with the DME having a greater yield than liquid extract. Woo-hoo!

f malts represent the sugar in beer (as I discuss in Chapter 4), hops surely
represent the spice. As a matter of fact, you use hops in beer in much the
same way that you use spices in cooking. The divine mission of hops is to
accent the flavor of beer and, most importantly, contrast the sweetness of the
malt. This spiciness isn’t all hops have to contribute, however.
Hops contribute five qualities to beer:
 Bitterness offsets the cloyingly sweet flavor of malt
 A zesty, spicy flavoring accents the malt character in beer
 A pungent floral/herbal aroma
 Bacterial inhibitors
 Natural clarifying agents
In this chapter, I discuss the plant origins of hops and the various ways 
these plants become the products you see on the shelves at the homebrew
shop. I also look at the world’s hop-growing regions and explain how to deci-
pher hopping instructions in brewing recipes. Finally, I give you some tips on
keeping your hops fresh and making hop substitutions or replacements.

Seeing the Hop Flower up Close
For the uninitiated, the hop cones used in the brewing process grow on vines
that may reach upwards of 25 feet on commercial hop farms. Hop plants are
hardy perennial plants that are quite prolific under ideal conditions, and each
may produce up to 2 pounds of dried hop cones per season. Figure 5-1 shows
you what hops look like.
Humulus Lupulus (also known as hops) is one of a small number of species
distantly related to the cannabis plant; hemp, the nettle, and the elm are also
distant cousins to cannabis.
Closer inspection of a mature hop cone, shown in Figure 5-2, reveals that it’s
mostly vegetative material (leaves and stems and whatnot), but at the base of
each little leaf is a cluster of minute yellow sacs about the size of pinheads.
These sacs are the waxy lupulin glands that contain the bitter acids, resins,
and essential oils that contribute bittering, flavoring, and aromatic qualities
to beer. Only when boiled extensively do these tiny glands erupt and deliver
their precious contents.

Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

The various methods of processing and packaging hops have made delivering
hop character to your homebrew easier; you can choose between whole leaf
hops, hop pellets, hop plugs, and hop extracts.
Isomerization takes place when the hops’ lupulin glands dissolve and release
their acids and resins into the wort. Through boiling, the alpha acids are 
converted to soluble iso-alpha acids, which are the main source of hop bitter-
ness. Complete isomerization in boiling wort may take up to an hour.
Traditionally speaking, brewers handpicked hops from the vine and air-dried
them in bulk before tossing them whole into the brewkettle. Today, however,
hops are processed and sold in four different forms, which I describe in the
following list (and show in Figure 5-3).
 Whole-leaf hops: As they did in the old days, farmers pick, dry, and bale
the hops exactly as they come off the vine. A downside is that whole-leaf
hops rarely come in oxygen-free packaging, leading to oxidation and 
staleness (which you can delay if you store your hops properly in dark,
cool, and dry conditions).
 Pellets: Hop processors create pellets by pulverizing hop flowers and
compacting them into small pellets about the size of a pencil eraser.
Ounce-for-ounce, these pellets take up only a quarter of the space of
whole leaf hops, but the process that pulverizes the hops also ruptures
the hop lupulin glands. On the plus side, the ruptured lupulin glands
allow the acids and resins to isomerize more quickly. Also, compressed
hop pellets make packing and storing more efficient, and the hop is 
rendered more stable. To guard against oxidation, the best way to pack-
age pelletized hops is in nitrogen or in oxygen-barrier bags. If packaged
and stored properly, pellets deteriorate at only one-tenth the rate of
whole hops (see the “Freshness is fundamental” section in this chapter
for more information).
 Plugs: This form of hops is more modern and seems to represent the
best of both worlds. Plugs are small hop chips formed by compressing
whole-leaf hops. Plugs combine the freshness of whole hops with the
convenience of pellets, though the gentler processing of plugs leaves
more lupulin glands intact. Also, plugs typically come in 2- to 5-ounce
quantities — way more than enough for a single 5-gallon batch of beer.
Brewing industry insiders also call hop plugs type-100 hoplets.
Developers initially created hoplets with commercial dry-hopping in
mind (see the “Dry hopping” sidebar in this chapter); plugs fit neatly
through the bungholes (the opening through which the kegs are filled) 
in kegs and casks. They’re not very good for playing checkers, though.
 Hop extract: Just as with malt extract, you can make your job easier 
by buying a highly concentrated liquid product that keeps the important
components and characteristics of hops intact. Although you typically
find these extracts in the large breweries, some extracts are available 
to homebrewers (particularly the hop oils).
53
Chapter 5: Hop Heaven

You can find three basic prepackaged hop extract products. One is a
concentrated bittering and flavoring agent that you can easily isomerize.
The second is Late Hop Essence, which adds spicy and floral hop flavors
to the beer, and the third (commonly known as hop oil) is strictly for
aroma adjustments in post-fermentation beer.
Initially, processors used steam distillation and chemical extraction to
capture these hop products, but the steaming process negatively affected
their flavor and brewers became concerned about residual chemicals left
in the product. More recently, a newer CO2 extraction process extracts
oils and alpha acids with none of the previous problems.
Whether you use extracts, essences, or oils, you add them in small
amounts (usually measured in increments of teaspoons). These seem-
ingly small amounts can have a big effect on the finished product,
because the human senses can perceive quantities in parts per million.
Therefore, a 2-ounce bottle of hop oil is sufficient to treat 30 gallons of
beer (six batches of homebrew)!

Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 
Dry hopping
Dry hopping is adding hops (in any form) to the
beer after primary fermentation for an added
touch of hop aroma. Because they’re compact,
hop plugs are better for dry hopping than whole
hops; however, hop pellets are usually best
because they’re compact and because their
smashed lupulin glands make the aromatic oils
more easily accessible to the beer.
You find two schools of thought as to whether
you can dry hop without contaminating your
beer. One side says the hops are unboiled and
may potentially contaminate your brew; the other
side (the one I agree with) says the alcohol in the
fermented beer is antiseptic enough to keep any
bacteria at bay. As a safeguard, you may want to
try steaming the hops in a strainer for about 5
minutes before adding them to the beer.
If you want to dry hop your beer, you should do so
during secondary fermentation (see Chapter 11
for more info on secondary fermentation). In any
case, whatever you put into the secondary fer-
menter needs to be strained out of the brew on
bottling day. The best way to avoid sucking up
hops or anything else from your secondary fer-
menter is to attach a sanitized plastic or stainless
steel scrubber that you would ordinarily use for
washing dishes to the end of your racking cane.

Hopping with Variety
More than 50 recognized hop varieties exist, and most of them grow in one of
the six well-known hop growing regions throughout the world (see Table 5-1).
Many of these varieties bear names that hint at their origins.

Outside of the regions listed in Table 5-1, hops also grow in parts of Belgium,
France, Poland, Slovenia, New Zealand, and my backyard, but these regions
aren’t nearly as distinguished as those shown in the table.
Regardless of their place of origin, the vast majority of cultivated hop vari-
eties are hybrids of original wild varieties, crossbred to capitalize on specific
genetic qualities such as high yields and resistance to disease. An amazing
amount of effort has gone into such hop cultivation, especially considering
that you use hops rather sparingly in the brewing process (only a few ounces
are needed for a 5-gallon batch of homebrew).
You may be asking yourself, “So if I use hops in such a minimal fashion, why
do so many regions grow so many varieties?” Well, the answer is quite
simple. Each hop variety offers different nuances in bittering intensity, flavor,
and aroma. The differences between them are often so subtle that even the
most experienced brewers and beer judges are hard-pressed to recognize
their individual attributes in a given beer — especially when you consider
that brewers often use blends of different hops in a single batch of beer.
Each hop variety is more or less bitter (like lovers scorned). But instead of
measuring hop bitterness in the number of forlorn letters sent and pleading
phone calls made, brewers use a scientific scale to determine hops’ percent
alpha acid content. Alpha acid content is the component within the lupulin
gland that correlates to bitterness, and brewers are very aware of these 
55
Chapter 5: Hop Heaven

percentages when they formulate recipes so that they can estimate the hops’ 
bittering potential in the beer. They also acquaint themselves with each hop
variety’s unique flavoring and aromatic properties so they know how and
when to use them. See the “Bittering potential is important too” section in
this chapter for more information.
 Hops that are used for their bittering potential are bittering hops or kettle
hops.
 Hops that are used for flavoring (but not necessarily bittering) are 
flavoring hops or late-kettle hops.
 Hops that are used for their aromatic contributions are aroma hops or
finishing hops.
 Hops that are held in school gymnasiums are sock hops.
Hey, this ain’t rocket science.
How and when you use the hops determines the effect that they have on 
the finished brew. The longer you boil the hops, the more bitterness dis-
solves into the wort (up to a point). Boiling hops for five minutes to a half 
an hour imbues the beer with far less bitterness than the hops could poten-
tially add, but you get some hop flavor. Adding hops very late in the boil and
boiling them for less than five minutes provides the beer with aromatics 
and little else.
Many homebrew recipes tell you not only which hop varieties to use and in
what quantities but also how long to boil them to get bittering, flavoring, or
aromatizing characteristics from them. In a homebrew recipe (including the
recipes in this book), you may see something like the following instruction:
1.5 oz. Galena (60 mins.), 1 oz. Kent Goldings (15 mins.), and 0.5 Cascade 
(5 mins.). This notation tells you that you want to boil an ounce and a half of
Galena hops for 1 hour (for bittering), add an ounce of Kent Goldings hops 
in the last 15 minutes of the boil (for flavoring), and add just a half-ounce of
Cascade hops in the last 5 minutes of the boil (for aroma).
You don’t want to boil aroma hops for more than 5 to 10 minutes because the
aromatic oils are very volatile and vaporize fairly quickly. The longer you boil
these hops, the more their aroma diminishes.
First wort hopping is yet another method of imbuing your beer with hop
flavor. Unfortunately, this method, which requires the brewer to add hops to
the brew during the sparging/lautering phase of mashing, is only useful to
brewers who produce their beer entirely from grain (see Chapter 12 for more
information).
56
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Selecting the Best Hops
Homemakers who want everything they cook or bake to come out tasting just
right tend to fuss about the finer details of their recipes. Having the right
ingredients isn’t enough — they have to be fresh, too.
And so it is with beer. It’s important to use the right hops for your brew —
especially if you are duplicating a recipe, but it’s even more important to use
the freshest hops you can. If you use old or stale hops, you could be brewing
up a recipe for disaster.
Freshness is fundamental
The freshness of hops is vital to the outcome of the beer. And, of course, 
in order for them to stay fresh, you need to store your hops properly. This
means that you need to keep them packed in nitrogen- or oxygen-barrier bags
and refrigerated (or, preferably, frozen) for long-term storage. But first things
first: You must know how to identify the fresh hops from the stale hops.
The first indicator of a hop’s freshness is its color. Fresh hops that are 
whole or in plug form usually have a light (almost lime) green color; fresh 
pelletized hops are typically a darker shade of green (a few hop varieties,
such as Goldings, have a yellowish cast) and may have a shiny exterior due
to the dried hop resins. Hops that look brown, dried out, and curled are 
probably pretty old; if the tiny lupulin glands are orange instead of yellow,
the hops are oxidized (stale) — get rid of ’em.
Check hops for aroma, too. Fresh hops have a fresh and piquant aroma that
you may describe as piney, floral, spicy, herbal, and even citrusy. Any hops
that have a pungent odor reminiscent of Parmesan or Romano cheese are
likely to be old and oxidized — throw them away. Any off flavors and aromas
evident before you use the hops will surely manifest in your beer.
57
Chapter 5: Hop Heaven
Noble hops: Brewing royalty
Noble hops are distinguished old-world varieties,
most of which have been cultivated for cen-
turies. They have relatively low alpha acid 
contents but are popular for their aromatic and
flavoring characteristics. Among the noble vari-
eties are Hallertauer, Hersbrucker, Spalt, and
Tettnanger in Germany; Saaz from Bohemia in
the Czech Republic; and Styrian from the former
Yugoslavia.
European Noble varieties are typically more
expensive than the same varieties grown in
North America, so many homebrew supply
shops and catalogs may not feature them (but
commercial beer labels often boast of their use).

Hop varieties are also graded according to their stability, which refers 
to how well they keep in storage. The freshness scale assigns a rating (very
good, good, fair, or poor) based on the percentage of the hop bitterness 
that remains after a six-month storage period at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21
degrees Celsius). (You can find out about individual hop stability ratings in
the appendix.) Unless you buy your hops in large quantities, however, you
don’t really need to concern yourself with their stability. Just make sure that
you buy them fresh, store them right, and use them soon.
Bittering potential is important too
After freshness, bittering potential is the next most important consideration
in your choice of hops. At harvest time, farmers measure hops for their alpha
acid content. You express the alpha acid content as a percentage of the acid’s
weight relative to the weight of the whole hop flower. For example, the 2006
Northdown crop from the U.K. has an alpha acid content of 7 percent, which
means that 1 pound of these hops contains 0.070 pounds of bittering acids.
This information appears on hop packaging as 7.0 AAU, which means alpha
acid units.
Each hop variety has a different acid content than another, and brewers need
to take this discrepancy into consideration. Alpha acid contents also vary
slightly from one growing season to the next, depending on the elements, and
from one place of origin to another. In this way, hops are to brewers what
varietal grapes are to winemakers.
Rumor has it brewers in the post-war Soviet Union resorted to bittering their
beer with ox bile when hop shipments became impossible to obtain. To your
health, Komrade!
Utilizing the utilization factor
Homebrewers need to be aware of the utilization factor, particularly when
brewing high-gravity beers. Utilization refers to the amount of bitterness
(alpha acid) extracted from the hops during the boiling phase. Both boiling
time and beer gravity (density) affect utilization.
The longer you boil the hops, the more bitterness you extract from the
lupulin glands and dissolve into the wort. This rule is only true up to a 
point, however; by the time you boil your hops for 90 minutes, all available
bitterness should be extracted.
Higher-gravity worts use hops less efficiently; the density of the wort keeps
the alpha acids from easily dissolving into the liquid. This tendency is espe-
cially apparent in wort gravities of 1.050 and higher. Most recipes already
take this utilization factor into account, but if you’re taking a low-gravity
58
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

recipe (1.050 or lower) and increasing its malt content, you need to calculate
the Gravity Adjustment (GA) factor when figuring the appropriate hop
increase in order to keep your beer flavor in balance.
Don’t worry, the following is a sample formula that can help you find the 
GA when necessary: GA= wort gravity – 1.050, ÷ 0.2. For example, if your wort
gravity is 1.070, your calculation should look something like this: GA= 1.070 –
1.050 = .020; .020 ÷ 0.2 = 0.10. This means you have to use 10 percent more
hops to achieve the same amount of bittering in a beer with a 1.070 gravity as
a beer with a 1.050 gravity. See — still not rocket science.
Calculating AAUs
Many homebrew recipes call for a certain hop variety by name or require a
certain number of alpha acid units (AAUs). These suggested varieties aren’t
always available to all homebrewers, so you may have to make hop substitu-
tions by figuring AAUs. This equation is simple, assuming you or your 
supplier knows the alpha acid content of the hops that you plan to use.
Here’s how you can plug in the numbers: Say that a recipe calls for 3 ounces
of Northern Brewer hops with 7.5 percent alpha acid; this means that the
recipe requires 22.5 AAUs (3 ounces × 7.5 percent alpha acid). To achieve 
bittering purposes only, you should be able to use 2 ounces of Chinook hops
(for example) with an alpha acid content of 11.25 percent (2 ounces × 11.25 =
22.5 AAUs).
Note: I say “for bittering purposes only” because Chinook hops and Northern
Brewer hops differ in taste.
Be sure to consider your recipe batch size; 22.5 AAUs called for in a 10-gallon
batch would be twice as bitter if used in a 5-gallon batch!
Despite being an imperfect science, calculating AAUs is much easier for
homebrewers to deal with than IBUs (International Bitterness Units). The 
difference is that AAUs measure how much alpha acid a recipe calls for; IBUs
actually measure bitterness in beer.
The formula for figuring IBUs in beer is rather complex. A Bitterness Unit is
equal to 1 milligram of isomerized alpha acid in 1 liter of beer (okay, maybe
this really is rocket science).
One more system for figuring bittering units in homebrew recipes is
Homebrew Bitterness Units, or HBUs. The HBU system is virtually identical 
to the AAU system. You calculate HBUs by multiplying the alpha acid percent-
age of a given hop by the number of ounces of that hop the recipe requires.
For example, if a recipe calls for a total of 24 HBUs, you need 3 ounces of
hops with 8 percent alpha acid, or 6 ounces of hops with 4 percent alpha 
acid (or any other ounce/percentage combination whose product is 24).

Taking Note of Top Hops
The North American microbrewing industry is developing a reputation for its
experimentation with new and experimental hop varieties. Of course, North
American homebrewers are quick to take note and follow suit.
The following is a list of the more widely used bittering and aromatic hops
(though not all of these varieties are new and experimental). For individual

Chapter 5: Hop Heaven
Using replacement hops
Most beer recipes allow you a fair amount of lat-
itude in choosing hop varieties because certain
hops have limited availability. Occasionally
recipes may include an alternative variety to
replace a first-choice variety. Often, the replace-
ment hops are American-grown varieties used in
place of the harder-to-get, more expensive
European varieties. For the record, American
hops are cheaper than European hops because
the U.S. has more consistent growing seasons,
not because the hops are inferior. The following
table shows you which American hops are good
replacements for traditional European types
(based on their similar bittering potential, flavor-
ing, and aromatic qualities). You can find out
more about hop varieties and descriptions in the
appendix.

Yeast and Fermentation
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of yeast
 Exploring fermentation
 Propagating yeast
 Figuring alcohol content
Yeast is one of the four primary ingredients in beer (the other three are
barley, hops, and water). Although yeast is an ingredient that the aver-
age beer consumer rarely contemplates, brewers often consider it the most
important ingredient. As a matter of fact, yeast can have a greater influence
and effect on the finished beer than any other single ingredient.
Brewers categorize and classify beer styles by the type of yeast used to 
ferment them; therefore, they choose a yeast according to the style of beer
they want to make. In this chapter, I discuss the nuts and bolts of yeast and
its role in fermentation, as well as give you the lowdown on the myriad of
options you have when choosing a yeast for your brew. I also provide some
tips on figuring alcohol content and deliver a bit of bad news for those of 
you hoping to brew a nonalcoholic batch.
There’s a Fungus among Us
Yeast is a member of the fungus family. It’s a living single-celled organism and
one of the simplest forms of life. Because it has cell-splitting capabilities, it’s
also self-reproducing. Yeast is the one ingredient responsible for carrying out
the fermentation process in brewing.
Fermentation, simply put, is the natural conversion of sugar to alcohol. Yeast
has a voracious appetite for sweet liquids. And, in exchange for a good, sweet
meal, yeast produces equal amounts of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and carbon
dioxide. Yes, the alcohol in your beer is similar to that which is added to
gasoline, except car ethanol is made from corn (yikes, adjunct gas!)

Yeast not only ferments beer, but it also ferments wine and any other natu-
rally alcoholic beverage. Because yeast produces carbon dioxide, it’s also
what causes bread dough to rise.
The temperature at which beer ferments can have a great effect on the fin-
ished product. The top-fermenting Ale yeast strains can complete their glut-
tonous feast in as little as three days. This quick, warm fermentation has a
tendency to give the resulting beer a rich and complex aroma and flavor pro-
file. As a direct result of the marriage of yeast type and temperature, ales
tend to be fruity and estery, often full of buttery or butterscotchy notes.
Estery is a word used to describe a beer that possesses aromas reminiscent
of flowers or fruits. Some yeast strains generate more esters than others.
Lager yeast actually developed a gradual genetic acclimation to its surround-
ings over hundreds of years. But because the cool temperatures at which
Lager yeast feeds result in sluggishness, Lager yeast needs lengthier fermen-
tation periods to complete its job. On the up side, however, the benefit of
such long and labored fermentation is the absence of fruitiness and buttery
character found in Ales. Lagers are therefore cleaner, smoother beers.
The word lager comes from the German lagern, which means to store. Because
summertime fermentations often resulted in sour beer, brewers knew better
than to brew beyond late spring. To keep up their stores of beer, Bavarian
brewers began brewing bigger-bodied beers in March and storing them in
Alpine caves throughout the warm summer months. Over time, the yeast
actually performed better under these cool conditions.
64
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 
Yeast genus and genius
For all the biology fans out there, here’s the
scoop on yeast. You can classify beer yeast 
into two categories, or species, of the genus
Saccharomyces: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and Saccharomyces uvarum. (Bread yeast is
also a part of this genus, but that’s just a crummy
factoid.)
 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is
commonly known as Ale yeast and contains
many substrains. It’s a top-fermenting strain,
meaning it floats on the top of the beer.
Virtually all Ale yeast works best in fairly
warm temperatures (60 to 70 degrees
Fahrenheit).
 Saccharomyces uvarum (S. uvarum) is a
bottom-fermenting strain (meaning it sinks to
the bottom of the fermentation vessel at the
end of fermentation) and is better known as
Lager yeast. Brewers developed Lager yeast
to ferment beer in cooler temperatures, and
it works best between 38 and 50 degrees
Fahrenheit. This strain is sometimes referred
to as S. carlsbergensis, for the Danish brew-
ery where brewers isolated and developed
it in 1883.

The Magic of Fermentation
Fermentation is, indeed, magical and mystical. A simple yeast cell consumes
sugar (in liquid form) and in turn excretes alcohol and carbon dioxide in
addition to hundreds of flavor compounds. As part of the growth process, a
single cell reproduces by cloning itself — splitting into two separate cells.
Multiply this chain of events by billions, and you have fermentation.
It’s cyclical
Before yeast can begin eating and multiplying, it must do its aerobics —
taking in as much of the oxygen from the wort as possible. Similar to oxygen-
breathing life forms, yeast needs oxygen to complete its metabolic processes.
After the yeast cells consume all or most of the oxygen in the wort, they
remain in suspension (float around in the liquid) for maximum contact with
the liquid sugars. After the yeast consumes all or most of the sugars, it begins
to flocculate, or clump together and fall out of suspension. At this point, the
yeast has lost energy and is preparing for a state of dormancy.
You can clearly separate the fermentation cycle into three phases:
 Yeast growth phase: This is the initial phase when the yeast cells absorb
the oxygen in the wort in preparation for their feast.
 Fermentation: This is the main event — the yeasts are devouring the
sugars in the wort and producing alcohol and CO2. Dividing yeast cells
double the total number of yeast cells in the wort every day.
 Sedimentation: This is the anticlimactic close of the fermentation cycle;
with the wort now devoid of oxygen and short on fermentable sugar, the
yeast begins to flocculate and settle to the bottom of the fermenter.
Peak fermentation is known as high kraeusen (pronounced kroy-zen). High
kraeusen usually occurs between days three and five of fermentation, 
assuming that the yeast got off to a good start.
Factoring in fermentation variables
How well fermentation takes place and how long it lasts depends on many
variables, including temperature, the amount of oxygen in the wort, the
amount of yeast pitched (added), the viability (health) of the yeast pitched,
and the amount of available fermentable sugars in the wort.
65
Chapter 6: Yeast and Fermentation

 Fermentation temperature, of course, should be within the recom-
mended ranges of the yeast according to species. Ale yeast works best
in temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Lager yeast 
performs best when temperatures are between 38 and 50 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Fermentation temperatures that are too low slow down the fermen-
tation or even stop it cold. Extreme temperatures on the high end cause
an increase in fermentation activity and an increased risk of bacterial
contamination. High fermentation temperatures (above 75 degrees
Fahrenheit) often result in off flavors and production of an alcohol other
than ethyl alcohol.
 Proper oxygen levels in wort enable the yeast to grow. You need to
properly aerate your wort prior to pitching the yeast. You can aerate by
sloshing the cooled wort around in the fermenter or with an oxygenating
device called a beer stone (see Chapter 27 for more information on 
beer stones).
 The amount of yeast pitched is important primarily because of lag time.
Lag time is the length of time between the pitching of yeast into the wort
and the time that active fermentation begins to take place (for healthy
fermentations, lag time shouldn’t exceed 24 hours). Lag time is affected
by the pitching rate (the number of cells added to the wort).
If the yeast volume is slow to multiply to desired quantities, any mutant
yeast cells or bacteria present can easily take over and ruin a batch 
of beer. You can avoid this problem by pitching the proper amount of 
yeast (overpitching is always better than underpitching). I recommend 
1 cup of yeast slurry (a high concentration of yeast cells in solution) per
5-gallon batch. See the section “Propagating yeast” in this chapter to
find out more about how to increase your yeast quantities.
One bacterial cell per 1,000 yeast cells constitutes a serious contamina-
tion and may result in a blown batch of beer.
 Yeast viability is rarely a problem with fresh yeast products purchased
new. Viability comes into question when you use an old, out-of-date
yeast product or attempt to revive old, tired yeast from the bottom of a
bottle-conditioned commercial beer (such as a well-aged Belgian
Trappist Ale).
 The amount of available fermentable sugars has a direct effect on 
the quality and length of fermentation. The more food you give the yeast
cells, the longer they continue to eat — up to a point. At around 8 or 9
percent alcohol, fermentation becomes self-destructive to yeast. In 
that concentration of alcohol, most beer yeast can no longer continue
fermenting; it falls into a stupor and eventually quits working. Reminds
me of some people I know.
66
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

When brewers set out to create a beer with an alcohol content greater than 
8 or 9 percent, they bring in more alcohol-tolerant yeast types such as Mead
or champagne yeast to finish the job.
Liquid yeast versus dry yeast: 
A foamenting debate
You’ve decided on a yeast type, so now you’re ready to brew, right? Not 
so fast — you still have to choose what form of that yeast you’re going to 
use. Yeast for the homebrewer comes in both a dry form and a liquid form.
Because of its convenience, I highly recommend dry yeast at the beginner
level. Dry yeast comes in granular form in small foil packets. You simply tear
these packets open and rehydrate the yeast in water before pitching it into
fresh wort. However, because of dry yeast’s lack of stylistic variety, I encour-
age you to progress to liquid yeast cultures as soon as you’re comfortable
with the handling procedures outlined in this chapter.
How dry I am. . .
The small packets (or do you say sachets?) of dried yeast that come with 
malt extract kits are sufficient to ferment a 5-gallon batch of homebrew. Dry
yeast is freeze-dried, so it should last a long time (but refrigerate all yeast to
maintain optimum freshness). And best of all, it’s the cheapest option.
For the best results with dry yeast, always rehydrate the dormant cells 
by pouring them into a cup of warm water (as I explain in Chapter 10). This
gentle wake-up call prepares the yeast for the upcoming fermentation. Be
sure to sanitize the vessel in which you rehydrate the yeast.
Of all the brands of dried yeast on the market, Nottingham Ale yeast, Windsor
Ale yeast, and Safale and Saflager are some of the best. They’re so good, 
in fact, that some commercial brewers even use them.
In the early days of homebrewing, dry yeasts weren’t entirely sterile; mutant
yeast and bacteria sometimes mingled with the good yeast in the packets.
You could only hope that the good yeast cells far outnumbered the bad. 
Also, dry yeast often consumed a greater percentage of available sugar in the
wort, which resulted in lower terminal gravities and drier beers (it’s almost
as if they were drinking up for lost time). Now I’m happy to report that 
these problems are largely a thing of the past. However, dry yeast comes in
relatively generic packets simply labeled “Ale” or “Lager” with no further
classification. This can be somewhat limiting to homebrewers wanting to
reproduce some of the more obscure beer styles, such as traditional German
Kolschbiers or Belgian Lambics.
67
Chapter 6: Yeast and Fermentation

Saying that dry yeast is more than capable of making good, drinkable beer is
like saying a 1971 Ford Pinto is more than adequate for getting you to work in
the morning. But with pure liquid yeast strains now available to the home-
brewer in a wide variety of beer styles, why settle for reliable transportation
when you can drive a real car? Check out Table 6-1 for some pros and cons of
using dry yeast.

Liquid assets
Brewing supply companies produce pure liquid yeast cultures in a sterile
environment; these come with limited guarantees for good brewing results.
Luckily, they culture the yeast according to individual beer styles. A small
handful of companies are now producing sterile liquid yeast cultures for both
the homebrewing and microbrewing industries. Many of these cultures were
obtained from their traditional sources, such as Trappist abbey breweries
and prestigious brewing institutes in Europe. Check out Table 6-2 for a com-
parison of the positives and negatives of using liquid yeast cultures.
To give you an idea of the wide range of individual yeast strains available,
Wyeast Labs (the original and best-known producer of liquid yeast cultures)
produces 17 different Ale cultures, 12 different Lager cultures, 5 different
Lambic cultures, 14 different Belgian Ale cultures, and 10 different wine, sake,
Mead, and Cider cultures.

Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Propagating yeast
Whether you prefer to work with vials or foil pouches, you may find that they
don’t provide you with the proper volume of yeast for pitching into a 5-gallon
batch (depending on your beer’s original gravity). Both types require you to
propagate (increase by natural reproduction) the yeast by feeding it more
sugar and nutrient in a separate container.
By adding more fermentable sugar in liquid form, you’re encouraging your
yeast to eat heartily, be fruitful, and multiply. Eventually, over the span of 
a few days, you’ll have the proper volume of yeast to pitch into a 5-gallon
batch of beer.
These procedures apply to liquid cultures only, not freeze-dried yeast.
High-gravity worts (those with gravities of 1.056 or higher) have a greater
need for yeast. For every gravity increase of 0.008 above 1.048, double the
yeast volume.
Propagating can take place in any glass vessel that you can seal with a 
rubber stopper, such as a mason jar, an old wine carafe, or an expensive glass
flask. The bottom line is that you must thoroughly sanitize the propagating
container and seal it with an airlock, just as you would any other fermenta-
tion vessel.
You can create the perfect sterile holding tank with a large 22-ounce or quart-
size beer bottle. The small rubber stopper that fits the hole in the primary
fermenter lid will also fit the bottle’s opening.
69
Chapter 6: Yeast and Fermentation
Smack packs
You may come across Activator packs (typically
referred to as smack packs), or liquid yeast cul-
tures sold in foil packets. These packets contain
both a small amount of pure yeast culture and 
a smaller, sealed plastic packet filled with a 
small amount of sterile liquid medium and malt
nutrient. This packaging keeps the yeast from
feeding until you’re ready.
The responsibility of feeding the nutrient mixture
to the yeast is yours. While holding the foil pouch
firmly on a flat surface with one hand, locate the
inner packet and pop it with the heel of the other
hand. The little packet is pretty squirmy, so pop-
ping it may take a couple of tries. After the inner
packet has burst, shake the foil pouch briskly to
fully mix the yeast and nutrient.
Depending on how old the foil packet is (check
the freshness date stamp), the packet may take
between one and five days to expand. Allow the
pouch to plump up before you repitch the yeast
into a sterile container for propagating. Always
read and follow the directions printed on the
back of these foil packets.

Here’s how to put your sterile holding tank to good use:
1. Sanitize your bottle as you would any other piece of homebrewing
equipment, along with a rubber stopper and an airlock.
(See Chapter 3 for more about sanitizing.)
2. Mix 1⁄2 cup of pale dry malt extract with 2 cups of water and boil.
3. When the extract and water mixture has cooled, pour the wort into
the bottle, add the yeast culture, and give it a good shake to introduce
some oxygen into the wort.
If you use a funnel, make sure it’s sanitized, too!
4. Seal the bottle with the stopper and airlock.
Lager yeast tends to reproduce more slowly than Ale yeast, even at proper
temperatures. Therefore, higher pitching rates are necessary in order to
achieve the same concentration of yeast cells in the fermenting beer. The
general rule is to pitch double the amount of Lager yeast, or 2 cups of yeast
slurry per 5-gallon batch.
You need to maintain a fairly high temperature (75 degrees Fahrenheit) for
the first 24 hours of the incubation period to encourage rapid yeast growth.
The best time to pitch the yeast into your wort is while you can see visible,
active fermentation taking place; definitely pitch the yeast before it sedi-
ments out of suspension. For batches of beer larger than 5 gallons or with
gravities greater than 1.056, you can easily increase the yeast volume by
propagating your culture a second or third time, using the same procedures
outlined above.
Every time you transfer the yeast to a new vessel, you increase the risk 
of contamination. Always practice immaculate sanitation when it comes to
yeast handling.
70
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 
Waiting in the bullpen
Since the introduction of smack packs, another
useful product has made homebrewers’ lives
even easier. Ready-to-Pitch (RTP) yeast doesn’t
even require propagation. Each yeast vial con-
tains an estimated 75 to 150 billion viable yeast
cells, which is plenty for the average 5-gallon
batch of brew.
RTP yeast consists of fresh, pure cultures that
combine the superior quality of liquid yeast with
the ease and convenience of dry yeast. Always
follow the package directions, but generally
speaking, all you have to do is warm and resus-
pend the yeast slurry and add it to your fermenter
when your wort is at an appropriate pitching
temperature.

Yeast energizers and nutrients
As if all the different yeast choices discussed earlier in this chapter weren’t
enough, you can also find energizers and nutrients for beer yeast. These 
vitamins and minerals are dietary supplements for yeast, designed to 
accelerate cell growth.
These products, which you can easily obtain through your regular homebrew
supplier, are fairly inexpensive (but not always necessary). You only need 
to use energizers and nutrients for high-gravity worts (those over 1.056) or
fermentable beverages with less than 60 percent malt content, such as Cider
or Mead, because your malt and (to a lesser extent) brewing water contain
most of the essential nutrients necessary for yeast nutrition.
Considering Alcohol Content
You can brew beer at home without caring one whit about its alcohol 
content, but I think you’d be in a very small minority. All the homebrewers I
know are very interested in knowing how much alcohol is in their brew,
whether it’s on the high side or the low side. And they also make a concerted
effort to target specific alcohol levels in their beer.
The same can be said for millions of non-homebrewers who simply want 
to know how much alcohol they’re consuming when they drink commercially
made beers. This section helps you understand how alcohol levels in beer
are measured and how that information is expressed to the consumer.
ABV versus ABW
You can express alcohol content in beer in two ways. Both are scientifically
accurate, but one can be somewhat misleading when compared to the other.
What I’m talking about here is the measurement of alcohol by volume and
alcohol by weight.
The more common method of listing alcohol content in beer is by actual per-
centage of volume, which is the law in the U.K. and Europe. In the U.S., some
corporate brewers list the alcohol by weight. Darn Yankees gotta be different.
Hydrometers used by homebrewers always register alcohol by volume, and
they say so right on the paper insert (see Chapter 2 for information on
hydrometers).
71
Chapter 6: Yeast and Fermentation

By standard measure, a pint of water weighs 1 pound (actually a fraction of
an ounce more). A pint of alcohol, on the other hand, weighs only .79 pounds.
Because alcohol weighs less than water (and beer, and most other liquids),
the weight of alcohol appears to be lower in weight comparisons. Rather
deceptive, don’t you think?
To make the point clearer, imagine the container of beer as a carton of ten
masonry bricks. If you take out one brick and fill the open space with a foam
block of equal size, the foam block still takes up 10 percent of the space in
the carton, but it weighs considerably less than the brick it replaced.
So, a beer with an alcohol content of 3.2 percent by weight actually contains
4.05 percent by volume; a beer that is 4 percent alcohol by weight actually
contains 5 percent by volume. To figure it out yourself, convert an ABW read-
ing to an ABV by multiplying the ABW by 1.25. To convert an ABV reading to
ABW, multiply the ABV by 0.79. Are you having fun yet?
Just remember that figures for weight are lower than figures for volume.
N/A (nonalcoholic) beer 
is n/a (not achievable)
Brewers who want to produce a nonalcoholic brew at home are going to be
sorely disappointed. In order to make a beer without alcohol, you need a 
lot of money to pay for the equipment or a lot of extra steps that are hardly
worth the time or effort.
As illustrated in this chapter, yeast is one of the four primary ingredients in
beer. It’s not only the catalyst for fermentation, but it also adds all kinds of
aromas and flavors to beer and is a major influence on the beer’s texture 
and mouthfeel. Therefore, just not adding yeast to the beer in not a viable
solution to making nonalcoholic beer. Unfermented beer is very thick, sweet,
and not at all thirst-quenching.
Commercial brewers are able to produce nonalcoholic beers in a number 
of ways, all of which require equipment and technology far beyond the
resources of homebrewers. All things considered, it’s a lot cheaper and 
easier to buy nonalcoholic beer at your local store.

 Identifying water’s role in good homebrew
 Examining the elements that affect water
 Debating the use of bottled water
W
ater is just one of the four primary ingredients used to make beer, but
considering that it constitutes up to 95 percent of a beer’s total ingre-
dient profile, water can certainly have a tremendous influence on the finished
product. Fortunately, today’s brewers can alter and adjust the chemical
make-up of a given water source to suit their brewing needs.
The various minerals and salts found in water used for brewing can accentu-
ate beer flavors or contribute undesirable flavor components. In many cases,
water chemistry is key in the flavor profile of a classic beer style.
Having said that, however, most of you will never apply the information in
this chapter to your brewing habits. Why? Because in spite of the somewhat
ominous statement made above, you can still make good beer with average
tap water. Thousands of homebrewers are proving it every day. A very gen-
eral rule says, “If your water tastes good, so will your beer.” A caveat is
important here, though: This general rule pertains solely to extract-based
homebrews.
The importance of certain aspects of water composition — namely pH
balance (see the “pHundamentals of pH balance” section in this chapter) —
becomes much more important when homebrewers begin mashing their own
grains. And water chemical profiles are really only important to the small 
percentage of homebrewers who are determined to imitate the water found 
in famous brewing cities around the world.

H2OH: Understanding How Water
Chemistry Affects Your Homebrew
At the homebrewing level, water is perhaps the most overlooked ingredient
in the beer recipe, and understandably so. The subject of water chemistry
can get pretty complicated, and the majority of homebrewers just don’t 
want to immerse themselves in something so deep. Although water purity is
genuinely important for making good beer, your need for concern ranges
from not-all-that-important at the beginner homebrewing level (see extract
brewing in Chapter 10) to immensely important at the advanced homebrew-
ing level (see all-grain brewing in Chapter 12). This assumes, of course, that
your current water source is perfectly drinkable.
At any skill level, make sure that you keep the following things in mind:
 If your water is from a private underground well, it may be high in iron
and other minerals that may affect your beer’s taste.
 If your water is softened, it may be high in sodium.
 If your water is supplied by a municipal water department, it may have 
a high chlorine content. Other than chlorine, the filtering (the primary
method of removing elements and impurities from water) performed at
municipal water sources usually produces water that is sufficiently pure
for brewing.
High iron, sodium, and chlorine contents in your brewing water are not desir-
able. If these minerals are present in your brewing water, you may want to
consider buying bottled water for your brewing needs.
If you’re interested in finding out the chemical profile of your municipal
water, call your local public works department and request an analysis of
their water — this information is usually provided free-of-charge. However, 
if you use a private water source, such as a well, you may have to hire an
independent company to perform a water analysis for you. In addition to
comparing your water analysis to that of famous brewing cities in Europe
(see the nearby sidebar), you can be the first on your block to have one!
Something Is in the Water
What is it about crystal-clear water that’s so inviting — to drink, to swim in,
to brew with? Ah, but this subject matter is murkier than it seems. And as a
homebrewer, you can’t dilute the reality that even crystal clear water harbors
things you need to know about. In the following section I plumb the depths of
these topics. My advice to you is to pay attention and just go with the flow.
74
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

pHundamentals of pH balance
pH is an abbreviation for potential of hydrogen or power of hydrogen, depend-
ing on whom you ask. pH balance refers to the acidity and alkalinity level 
in various liquids; you measure this balance on a 14-point pH scale. A rating
of 1–6 on this scale is acidic, and a rating of 8–14 is alkaline. A pH of 7 is 
neutral, or balanced.
For beginners, the pH balance in brewing water is, for the most part, irrele-
vant. When brewers progress to mashing procedures, however, monitoring
pH levels in mashing water is absolutely critical. At the more advanced levels
of homebrewing, you may need to add either gypsum or calcium carbonate to
the water to achieve the desired pH level when a given water source is either
acidic or alkaline. (See the “Mineral ions” section in this chapter for informa-
tion on the effects of gypsum and calcium carbonate on brewing water.) For
pH measuring and adjustment procedures, see Chapter 12.
Speaking in very general terms, brewers prefer slightly acidic water over 
alkaline water; a pH level of 5.5 is usually ideal. Slightly alkaline water is
acceptable for brewing dark beers, however, because dark malt’s acidity
strikes a natural balance with the alkaline profile of the water.
Antibacterial agents
Chlorine — the one element municipal water treatment stations add to 
water — is something that beginner brewers need to be particularly aware of.
Chlorine is added to water as an antibacterial agent. Even in minute dilutions
(measured in parts per million), chlorine kills bacteria, and it can kill your

beer, too — in terms of flavor, that is. Don’t worry about the fluoride added to
some municipal water supplies; as far as I know, it has no negative effect on
the beer.
Chlorinated water used for brewing may create chlorophenols in your beer.
Chlorophenols are unpleasant-smelling and -tasting compounds that are 
reminiscent of burnt plastic and cheap vinyl furniture. (How’s that for mental
imagery?) You can avoid this problem in a few different ways, depending on
the time, money, and energy you have to spend.
 Buy and attach a carbon filter to the faucet you draw your brewing
water from. Carbon filters are very effective at removing chlorine. On 
the down side, this method can be expensive.
 Buy bottled water from a bottled water delivery company or by the
gallon at your local supermarket. This method can save you time (espe-
cially if you get your water delivered to your door), but it also can prove
inconvenient if you have to drag jugs of water home from the store. (See
the following section for more information about buying bottled water.)
 Preboil all the water you need for your beer. Boiling causes the chlorine
to melt into a gas and float up and out of the water, evaporating in 
the steam. This method is effective, but it can be a time- and energy-
consuming practice.
 Buy a bunch of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, some molecule glue, and
start your own water factory. This method can land you in a padded
room.
Not all water sources get the chlorine treatment. Some rural water supplies
are contaminated with enterobacteria (otherwise known as wort spoilers).
Consider having a water analysis company determine whether your water is
contaminated with this foe. If there are enterobacteria in your water, keep
your water heater set at 160 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and, for sanitizing
purposes, rinse your equipment with hot water only.
Hard facts, fluid concepts
Many people have a tendency to see water as being merely soft or hard, 
but water chemistry is just not that simple. Soft water is very low in mineral
content, and hard water has a very high mineral content. What is pretty
simple, though, is the generalization that soft water is preferable to hard
water because adding minerals to the water (if needed) is a lot easier than
removing them.
Of course, if you have hard water, you must determine whether you have tem-
porary hardness or permanent hardness. Temporary hardness refers to the
presence of soluble bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium that precipitate
out when you boil the water. Precipitation occurs when mineral ions are
76
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

attracted to one another, bond together, and then fall out of solution as 
sediment (see the section “Mineral ions” later in this chapter). Permanent
hardness refers to water hardness after you’ve boiled the water and all the
nonprecipitating minerals are still there. Your water can be temporarily hard,
permanently hard, or both at once — prior to boiling, that is.
Mineral ions
In simple terms, mineral ions are components of mineral salts that dissolve 
in water. And because ions have either a positive or negative charge, they’re
electrically attracted to the ingredients used to make beer (malt, hops, and
so on). The effects of these mineral ions can range from enhancing protein
coagulation (which helps to clarify beer) to accentuating the flavor of 
the malt.
Some mineral salts — namely calcium carbonate and magnesium 
carbonate — are responsible for leaving the telltale white scale on the 
sides of pots of boiling water.
At least seven principal ions exert a substantial influence on the beer-making
process. The following list provides a brief description of these ions and their
influences (the term ppm means parts per millions):
 Calcium: Lowers pH and assists enzyme action during mashing.
 Carbonate: Halts enzyme action and promotes harsh flavor derived 
from hops.
 Chloride: At high levels (250+ ppm) may enhance the sweetness of beer.
 Bicarbonate: Halts enzyme action and promotes harsh flavor derived
from hops.
 Magnesium: Lowers pH and is an important yeast nutrient at 10 to 
20 ppm.
 Sodium: Has no chemical effect and may impart roundness (fill out beer
flavor). At too high a concentration, sodium can also give a salty flavor.
 Sulfate: Has no chemical effect and may impart harsh dryness when
used with sodium.
Yet brewers sometimes use other mineral salts to adjust the pH level of their
mashing water (see the “pHundamentals of pH balance” section in this 
chapter) or increase the ion profile of their brewing water. These include
 Calcium carbonate: More commonly known as chalk, calcium carbonate
raises pH; 1 teaspoon in 5 gallons of liquid adds 60 ppm of carbonate
and 36 ppm of calcium.
77
Chapter 7: On the Water Front

 Calcium sulfate: More commonly known as gypsum, calcium sulfate
lowers pH; 1 teaspoon in 5 gallons of water adds 140 ppm of sulfate and
60 ppm of calcium.
 Magnesium sulfate: More commonly known as Epsom salt, magnesium
sulfate lowers pH; 1 teaspoon in 5 gallons of water adds 100 ppm of 
sulfate and 25 ppm of magnesium.
 Sodium chloride: More commonly known as table salt, sodium chloride
has no effect on pH; 1 teaspoon in 5 gallons of water adds 170 ppm of
chloride and 110 ppm of sodium.
Trace metals
Also considered secondary ions, trace metals don’t have a significant impact
on beer flavor unless they’re present in large quantities; then these trace
metals can ruin a brew altogether. Copper, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc
are some trace metals that may be found in a natural water source.
Although most of these trace metals are generally undesirable in brewing
water, a few are actually beneficial in very small amounts. Manganese,
copper, and zinc, for example, are valuable nutrients for yeast-cell develop-
ment. Iron, on the other hand, can have an extremely detrimental effect on
beer flavor, and lead can be toxic to yeast (not to mention humans) in high
quantities. You can remove all of these metals from the water by filtration 
or distillation, or you can simply adjust their concentrations by diluting with
filtered or distilled water.
Buying Brew-Friendly Bottled Water
If you choose to buy your water, you may be tempted to buy distilled water
because it’s the purest form available. But distilled water is also completely
devoid of some of the important natural elements beneficial to beer.
Distilled water is made by boiling water, recapturing the steam, and cooling it
back down to liquid form. This steam distillation method leaves all natural
elements, chemicals, and impurities behind.
I try to strike a compromise. I like to use about 2 to 21⁄2 gallons of municipal
water straight from the kitchen faucet for the boiling in the brew kettle (most,
if not all, of the chlorine is gassed out). Then, to cool and dilute the wort in
the fermenter (just prior to pitching the yeast), I use up to 3 gallons of store-
bought distilled water that I’ve refrigerated. See Chapter 10 for more details
on these processes.

Chapter 7: On the Water Front
Wetting your appetite
No doubt, you’ve heard ads for beer that tout
“from the land of sky-blue waters” or “brewed
with pure, Rocky Mountain spring water.”
Breweries like to boast about the purity of the
water that they use to brew their beer.
Some of the classic world styles of beer became
classics because of the water used to make the
beer. The famed Pilsener beers of Bohemia, such
as Pilsener Urquell, are considered premier
examples. These crisp, hoppy Lagers are made
with extremely soft water that the brewers 
pump from the aquifers below the brewery. By
contrast, the legendary British ales of Burton-on-
Trent, such as Bass Ale, are made with particu-
larly hard water. Considering these examples
(among others), it’s obvious that water can play a
big role in beer flavor.
But any water, regardless of its source, can be
manipulated to match the profile of another
source. For example, brewers wanting to emu-
late the beers from Burton-on-Trent simply 
add certain minerals called Burton salts to 
the brewing water in a process known as
Burtonizing.

Adjuncts and Flavorings
In This Chapter
 Adding to your brew with adjuncts
 Savoring flavorings
 Spicing up your beer with herbs and spices
A
nyone paying even the slightest bit of attention to the current beer
market knows that brewers now put a lot of unusual ingredients into
their beers — ingredients that may make the beer purist choke on her Old
Frothy. Fruits, herbs, sugars, spices, and who knows what else show up in
commercial beers almost as frequently as bubbles.
This trend hasn’t always been the case, though experimentation is far from
the cutting edge. Beer makers over the ages have used some odd ingredients
in their beers from time to time. But homebrewers, with their innate desire 
to experiment and push the limits, just seem to take the concept to 
another level.
These unusual ingredients, whatever they may be, aren’t limited to the 
role of flavorings, although flavoring is often their primary purpose. Brewers
also utilize a variety of adjunct ingredients (any fermentable ingredients other
than malted grains) to jack up alcohol levels, to thin out or fill out a beer’s
mouthfeel, or even to enhance the beer’s foaminess. Adjuncts aren’t the same
as adjunct grains (cereal grains such as rice and corn used to make beer in
general), which I discuss in Chapter 4. For the purposes of this chapter, the
adjuncts I focus on are nongrain sugars that you can use in smaller portions
to add certain flavors or fermentable ingredients to the beer-making process.
Keep in mind that the line between adjuncts and flavorings is often blurry
(along with everything else after a few tasty homebrews). Adjuncts are used
with the express intent of contributing fermentable sugars, but they can also
add flavor; flavorings are used with the express intent of adding flavors, but
they may also add fermentable sugars.
You won’t find any hard-and-fast rules about how to use adjuncts and flavor-
ings in your brews — you’re limited only by your own imagination. Given the
vast amount of experimentation in the world of homebrew, though, some

adjuncts and flavorings just go better with certain beer styles than others
(like smoke character in Porter, for example). In this chapter, I give you the
lowdown on adjuncts and flavorings and how to use them. I also explore the
rising popularity of using herbs and spices in homebrewing.
Adjuncts: Sugar, Sugar . . .
Aw, Honey, Honey
Adjunct sugars are often called kettle adjuncts because you add them directly
to the wort in the brew kettle instead of treating them in a separate vessel
like adjunct grain. These kettle adjuncts are available in many different forms.
Some are sweeter than others, and some ferment more easily than others.
The following list describes some of these sugars:
 Fructose: Found in fruits and, to a lesser extent, malted grain. The
sweetening power of fructose is more than 11⁄2 times that of refined white
sugar (which is also known as sucrose, or table sugar).
 Dextrose: Also a refined white sugar derived from hydrolyzed cornstarch
(starch that has reacted with water and changed into glucose). Dextrose
is highly fermentable and popular for priming (see Chapter 13 for more
about dextrose and priming).
 Glucose: Derived from starch (on a molecular level, glucose and 
dextrose are identical) and many fruits. Glucose has only 50 percent 
of the sweetening power of ordinary table sugar.
 Sucrose: A compound of one molecule each of glucose and fructose;
sucrose is found in sugar cane, sugar beets, sorghum, and malted grain.
Table sugar is about 99.5 percent sucrose.
 Lactose: Found in milk. Beer yeast can’t ferment lactose, so whatever
lactose you add to your beer will remain there. Lactose is common in
infant formula and various confections — not to mention Sweet Stout.
Most often, you find these sugars in processed form (such as refined 
white sugar), but you can also use some of them in their natural form, as is
the case with honey and pure maple syrups. Again, the primary objective in
using adjunct sugars is to add fermentable ingredients to the beer (which
results in increased alcohol levels), and the secondary objective is to imbue
the beer with unique flavor. The following is a list of optional adjuncts that
contain various sugars:
 Honey: Honey is made from the nectar of flowers and processed with
enzymes secreted by the honeybee. The two main ingredients in honey
are glucose and fructose, with traces of sucrose and maltose — say 
that three times fast! Honey is highly fermentable and can add delicate
82
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

sweetness and aroma to your brew, depending on the type of honey you
choose. The quality and flavor of honey can vary greatly from one vari-
ety to the next (literally thousands of varieties are on the market), but
light honeys, such as alfalfa and clover, work well in beer because their
flavor is less aggressive. Because it’s so fully fermentable, using honey
also results in thinner-bodied beers. For this same reason, using honey
also results in more alcohol per pound of honey added to the beer 
(compared to the same quantity of malt extract). Check out Chapter 19
for more information about honey.
 Rice syrup or corn syrup: Both rice and corn syrup are very neutral in
flavor. Using high percentages of these processed syrups (relative to the
rest of the ingredients) results in pale-colored, lighter-bodied, lighter-
flavored beers, such as North American Light Lagers. These syrups are
also effective in raising alcohol levels in dark beers without appreciably
affecting the beers’ flavor profiles. Note: Use only brewer’s grade rice 
or corn syrup. Both of these syrups are highly fermentable and result in
higher alcohol levels per pound of syrup added (compared to the same
quantity of malt extract). Also note that rice syrup is available in a 
powdered form known as rice syrup solids.
 Sorghum syrup: Pure white sorghum syrup is especially handy for creat-
ing low-gluten or gluten-free beers (see Chapter 21 for more information
on gluten-free brewing), but you can also use this syrup like rice or corn
syrup for making lighter-bodied and -colored brews.
 Maple syrup: Natural maple syrup is mostly sucrose with some invert
sugar (a mixture of certain forms of glucose and fructose. See the side-
bar “Making invert sugar syrup” for more information.) The more natural
the syrup, the better (pure maple syrup must weigh no less than 11
pounds per gallon). Depending on the quality, which is based on the per-
centage of maple sugar in the syrup, maple flavor may be very assertive
in the beer. Maple syrup, depending on the sugar content, is about 65
percent fermentable, which means the yeast eats about 65 percent of
whatever amount you add to your beer.
 Brown sugar: Brown sugar is derived from unrefined or partially refined
sugar (cane or beet), and flavored with molasses. It’s usually available in
light and dark brown choices. The darker brown the sugar, the more
residual flavor it leaves in the beer.
 Molasses: Molasses syrup is produced during the refining of white 
sugar from sorghum or from the juice of sun-ripened cane. Be sure to
buy unsulfured molasses (sulfur fumes used in the sugar-making 
process are retained in molasses and must be commercially extracted).
Usually, molasses is available in three colors/flavors — light, dark, and
blackstrap — based on its degree of caramelization and concentration.
Light molasses results from the first boiling of the cane, and dark
molasses is the product of a second boiling. Blackstrap molasses, pro-
duced from a third boiling, is a waste product in the sugar industry, but
it’s great for Stouts and other dark beers.
83
Chapter 8: Adjuncts and Flavorings

 Treacle: Often incorrectly defined as molasses in the King’s English,
treacle is a brown-colored syrup also known as refiner’s syrup. Although
it’s derived in much the same way as molasses, it often comes clarified
and decolorized, so it’s not as dark and aggressive in flavor as molasses.
Treacle isn’t an equal substitute for molasses, but it still makes an 
interesting adjunct sugar for beer-making purposes.
 Belgian candi sugar: Chunky, caramelized sugar in crystals and granular
form are popular in Belgian Strong Ales and Trappist beer varieties; they
usually come in golden to dark amber varieties. Candi sugar enhances a
beer’s flavor and alcohol levels. More recently, candi syrup has become
available to homebrewers. Pound for pound, the syrup gives more color
and caramelized flavor than the sugar crystals. Belgian candi sugar is 
a good source of sucrose.
 Turbinado sugar: Also known as raw sugar, turbinado sugar is a par-
tially refined, coarse, beige-colored crystal that still contains some of the
molasses from the original sugar. Depending on the source, turbinado
sugar may contain impurities. Homebrewers who can get their hands on
this stuff like to experiment with it in high-gravity Ales such as English
Old Ales or Barley Wines. Check your local ethnic grocery store for
turbinado sugar. It’s also another good source of sucrose.
 Demarara sugar: Demarara sugar is very close in character to turbinado
sugar but with a darker color and more pronounced molasses flavor.
Readily fermentable, it’s excellent for dark Ales.
You should add these naturally occurring sugars sparingly to your brew, and
they shouldn’t constitute a large percentage of the total fermentable ingredi-
ents in your recipe. One pound or less per 5-gallon batch is a typical amount.
Make sure you stay away from using refined white sugars (sugar made from
cane or beets) in brewing. White sugars used in quantities of more than 
20 percent of total fermentable ingredients result in a noticeable cidery smell
and taste. Also, white sugars are so highly fermentable that your beer will
have a measurable increase in alcohol while suffering a measurable decrease
in body and mouthfeel. Dextrose (corn sugar) is the only granular white
sugar that you should use for priming beer at bottling time (see Chapter 13 
to find out more about dextrose and bottling).
Flavoring Your Brew with Flavorings
Beyond adding adjunct sugars to your brew, an unlimited number of flavor-
ings exist that you can add to beer. Some may contain sugars that result in
added gravity and alcohol, but I cover most of those flavorings in previous
sections in this chapter. In this section, I focus on those ingredients that are
primarily used to add unique flavors to beer.
84
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

The goal when using these flavorings is to complement the underlying beer
flavor, not to create a whole new one. Whenever possible, make sure you add
these ingredients directly to the brewpot to take advantage of the disinfect-
ing action of the boiling wort and to meld the flavors into the brew. (I note
the exceptions to this “add to the brewpot” rule in the next section.)
Funky flavorings: The exotic 
and the esoteric
The following is a list of flavorings that are commonly used in the homebrew-
ing world:
 Chocolate: Beer made with real chocolate is an esoteric (old-but-not-out-
of-date) brew that brewers make only occasionally (most brewers create
chocolate character in their beers by using chocolate malt, which has
nothing to do with the cocoa bean). Use only unsweetened baker’s
chocolate (found in the baking goods aisle of your local supermarket),
not milk chocolate or sweetened chocolate. One or two 1-ounce squares
in a 5-gallon batch are sufficient. Or you can use cocoa powder (the
same stuff used in baking) or the powdery chocolate substances popu-
lar for chocolate-milk making. Try chocolate (sparingly) in a medium-
bodied spiced Ale. Gives a whole new meaning to the term chocoholic,
doesn’t it?
85
Chapter 8: Adjuncts and Flavorings
Making invert sugar syrup
A handful of beer styles — primarily those from
England and Belgium — regularly use added
sugar in their recipes. Because using large
amounts of refined sugar can create a cidery
tang in beer, brewers can safely make and use
invert sugar to reduce the sugar’s acidic effect
on their beer’s flavor. Here’s how:
Ingredients:
 8 pounds of white cane/beet sugar
 2 pints of water
 1 tablespoon (or 3 teaspoons) of citric acid
Directions:
1. Mix all ingredients in a large pot and heat to
boiling (the mixture will foam and then turn a
clear, golden color).
2. Cool and then dilute in water to reach a total
volume of 1 gallon.
One pint of this liquid invert sugar equals 1 pound
of granular sugar.
Add too much of this sugar to your beer, and you
can still get a cidery taste. I recommend that
invert syrup make up less than 20 percent of your
total fermentable ingredients.

 Spruce essence: Spruce beer was an early American favorite. Using 
the new spring growth (the needles) of the spruce tree was the old 
fashioned method. Today, you can buy spruce essence through your
homebrew supplier, but this stuff is pretty potent. Two to five teaspoons
give your beer a refreshing spruce taste. Pretend you’re a patriot and
spruce up your favorite Ale.
 Licorice: Drinkers often experience a licorice flavor in dark beers even
when it hasn’t been specifically added to the brew. Brewers who like 
this flavor can add all they want to their own beer by using unsweetened
brewer’s licorice sticks, which you can find at your homebrew supply
shop. But be careful not to overuse licorice — a little goes a long way.
One or two inches are sufficient for a 5-gallon batch. Licorice is 
especially good for Porters, Stouts, and Schwarzbiers.
 Fruit flavorings: Some fruit flavorings are available without added sugar.
You use these liquid flavorings in the same way you use fruit juices or
extracts, except that unsweetened fruit flavorings don’t require fermen-
tation time. Of these flavorings, the most common flavors are blueberry,
cherry, raspberry, peach, and apricot — check with your local home-
brew supply shop. Doses depend on the fruit, the brand, your personal
taste, and so on. Fruit flavorings are much easier to work with than real
fruit; they’re widely available and never out of season. To preserve as
much fruit character as possible, some producers even suggest adding
the flavoring to the beer at bottling time. These flavorings work well in
virtually all beer styles, but the darker the beer, the more flavoring you
need to compete with the flavors of the underlying beer.
 Oak chips/oak extract: Brewers wanting to emulate the oaky character
of traditional India Pale Ales or their favorite oak-aged Belgian beers 
can try using oak chips. Because oak adds tannin to beer, you never
want to boil the chips. (Tannin is derived from organic compounds such
as cereal grain husks, oak bark, grape skins, and the rinds of shelled
nuts. Tannin is a sharp, astringent [bitter] flavor; if you’ve ever acciden-
tally eaten some of the red rind found inside a pecan, you know how
unpleasant tasting tannin can be.) The best way to use oak chips is to
steam them for 15 minutes (to sanitize them) before adding them to the
secondary fermenter. You can find oak chips in regular and toasted form
(hold the butter). Oak flavor is also available in extract form.
 Lactose: Lactose powder has a very limited use in the homebrewing
world — it’s primarily used to add sweetness and body to beer without
the risk of cidery flavors or higher alcohol levels. Beer yeast can’t fer-
ment lactose, so the lactose retains virtually all of its sweetness. Lactose
is a prerequisite for making London-Style Sweet Stout (also called 
Cream Stout or Milk Stout for obvious reasons). Six to twelve ounces per
5-gallon batch gets the job done.
86
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

 Smoke: Rauchbier (Smoked Beer) is another esoteric brew. Fans of
German Rauchbier — and even Scottish Ales — can emulate their
favorite smoky brews by using liquid smoke extract. Add a tablespoon
or two per 5-gallon batch at the very end of the boil, depending on your
tolerance for smoke aroma and flavor. Well-stocked grocery stores carry
this extract because cooks often use it for making homemade barbecue
sauces. Avoid buying cheaper brands that contain vinegar or preserva-
tives. The drawback to this method is that most liquid smoke extracts
give off the aroma and flavor characteristics typically associated with
barbecued meats, like hickory, mesquite, and so on.
You can also imbue smoke flavor in a more natural way by using smoked
malts. You can buy these malts at homebrew supply shops or create
them at home on a barbecue grill (see Chapter 26 for more information
on creating your own smoked malts).
 Vanilla: Homebrewers can choose between working with pure vanilla
extract and using the purist’s vanilla bean, though neither is terribly
common in beer making. Commercial brewers who produce this unusual
flavor of brew usually reserve it for a once-a-year specialty Spiced Ale 
or Christmas beer.
 Orange peel: Due to the growing popularity of Belgian Witbier, dried
orange peel is now available at most good homebrew supply stores.
Choose between sweet orange or bitter (Curaçao) orange variety. 
A couple of ounces per 5-gallon batch are a typical amount.
 Fruit liqueurs: Certain fruit liqueurs can be used for flavoring beer, but
because they contain large amounts of refined sugar, they’re best as
priming agents (see Chapter 13 to read more about priming with
liqueurs).
Herbs and spice and everything nice
At some point in your blossoming brewing career, you’re likely to grow the
same wild hair that every other homebrewer has grown. One day you’ll be
contemplating your next brew over an odoriferous plate of Italian food when
out of nowhere it’ll hit you: — “Hmmm, I wonder what garlic beer tastes like?”
You may laugh, but somebody actually made a garlic beer (unfortunately 
for those of us who tasted it). In fact, in the world of homebrew, you’re 
hard-pressed to find a stone left unturned.
Herb and spice beer is the category that really challenges the conventional
ideas of beer, although what seemed alien a half a dozen years ago is now
reaching the mainstream. Coriander seems to be the herb du jour (or is it a
spice — I’m not sure). Allspice is on the rise, and ginger is making a 
comeback; cinnamon and cloves are passé.
87
Chapter 8: Adjuncts and Flavorings

Your spice rack at home presents an (almost) unlimited variety of choices for
your next brew, but don’t make the same mistake many brewers before you
have made. Just because you like the taste of cumin and lemongrass doesn’t
mean adding such a combination to your brew makes a great beer. Before
forging ahead, you need to reflect a bit on your idea. Try to imagine the taste
of the beer you have in mind. Is it something you want to drink two cases of?
If so, move cautiously, remembering that using too little of an ingredient is
better than using too much.
Give your beer flavoring idea a taste test: Try brewing a little “tea” of the herb
or spice you have in mind and strain it into a commercial beer similar to the
style you intend to make. You may also want to jot down your tasting notes
to help fine-tune your final recipe.
You can introduce herbs and spices two ways in the beermaking process:
 Add them directly to the brewpot.
 Put them in the secondary fermenter. (See Chapter 11 for more on 
secondary fermentation.)
If you go the brewpot route, wait until the last 15 minutes of the boil.
Allowing certain herbs or spices (such as cinnamon bark) to boil in the 
wort for long periods of time can sometimes create an astringency or 
harshness similar to the result of boiling grain.
If you hold out until the secondary fermentation stage, you need to sanitize
the ingredients. Hold the bleach — this is a job for distilled alcohol. Whatever
consumable spirits (whisky, vodka, gin, and so on) you may have in your
home can get the job done. Allow the herb or spice of choice to soak in 1⁄2 cup
of whatever booze you choose for about a week prior to putting the herb or
spice in the secondary fermenter; what you do with the spiced liquor is your
business. Actually, dumping the entire herb/spice liquor concoction into the
secondary fermenter is okay, too.
To make the ingredient-soaking process easier, try fashioning a small filter or
pouch out of an unused coffee filter or fresh tea bag you’ve emptied of its
contents; close with a twist-tie or string.
Fresh and whole herbs and spices are better than those that are old, stale,
chopped, or powdered.
Spices
A wide variety of spices are available for you to use to enhance the flavor of
your brews. The following is a short list of some of the most popular spices 
in the homebrewing world — the tried-and-true choices:
88
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

 Allspice: Allspice is one of the more interesting spices to use; within 
the single small berry is a natural mixture of flavors reminiscent of 
cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and juniper berries. Brewers often use allspice
in seasonal pumpkin beers.
 Anise: The star anise variety is most common. This spice gives beer a
subtle licorice undertone.
 Cardamom: The plump seeds of the cardamom family appear in culinary
applications as diverse as coffee flavoring, barbecue sauces, and curry
powder. Used judiciously, cardamom lends beer a unique and subtle
spicy flavor.
 Caraway: You rarely use this seed on its own, but it’s a natural comple-
mentary flavoring for anyone attempting to make a flavorful rye beer.
 Cinnamon: Cinnamon seems to be the go-to spice for pastries and 
other confections. Cinnamon works well in big-bodied beers made for
wintertime consumption. Make sure you use cinnamon bark rather 
than powder because you can easily remove the sticks from the brew;
cinnamon powder (unless filtered out) remains in the beer and may
create a harsh flavor and an unpleasant lingering mouthfeel.
 Cloves: Clove-like aromas and tastes occur naturally in some beer 
styles — most notably the Bavarian Weizenbiers and some Belgian 
Ales. Homebrewers can introduce this clove character by using whole
cloves — in small quantities. Many people perceive cloves to have a
strong phenolic or medicinal character.
 Coriander: Coriander is the seed of the same plant from which cilantro
is derived. The lemony coriander is a key ingredient in a traditional
Belgian Witbier, but it also works well in many beer styles.
 Gingerroot: The flavor of raw gingerroot (also known as just ginger) 
is intense and spicy-hot or sharp in anything but small quantities or 
dilutions. The actual flavor — most closely associated with ginger ale
(soda) — actually works quite well in beer and Mead. The key is to use
grated gingerroot rather than ginger powder. Use gingerly; 1 ounce in 
a 5-gallon batch of beer is plenty noticeable.
The original ginger ale really was Ale. The concoction was a standard
beer in colonial America because the colonists used ginger and other
spices in the absence of hops to offset the malty sweetness of beer.
 Juniper berries: Because juniper berries are used to make gin, you can
use them to give your brew the same aroma and flavor as gin — if you
happen to like gin.
 Vanilla bean: Although high-quality vanilla extract is easier to work
with, the oil of the vanilla bean can also lend a pleasant mouthfeel to
your brew while it gives a rich aroma and flavor. For best results, use
macerated (crushed) vanilla beans during secondary fermentation only.
89
Chapter 8: Adjuncts and Flavorings

Herbs
The following herbs are also worth trying in your homebrew:
 Sweet gale: This herb is an aromatic seasoning that many Belgian 
brewers use to add a lightly sweet flavor. Use sparingly.
 Heather tips: Dried heather tips were popular in Scotland to balance
malty sweetness before the advent of hop usage. You can find a Heather
Ale currently available in the United States by the brand name Fraoch.
 Mint: Mint isn’t normally high on the list of brewing herbs, but I can 
personally attest that it can work in certain beer styles if handled 
properly — a Mint Stout stands out in my memory. You’re probably
familiar with peppermint and spearmint, but some lesser known mint
varieties, such as apple mint, are less assertive and equally refreshing.
Many other popular cooking herbs can also successfully flavor beer; basil,
oregano, and rosemary come to mind. Be bold, be brave, be intrepid, and 
be ready to drink two cases of whatever it is you dream up!

W
elcome to the chapter that concentrates on all the nonessential minor
ingredients sometimes found in beer. The various elements discussed
in this chapter have little or nothing to do with beer flavor and aren’t
absolutely necessary for making good beer. However, you can use all of the
elements defined here to polish your homebrew (in other words, to manipu-
late your beer in various ways that may affect the quality and perception of
the finished product).
It’s important to note the distinction between quality and the perception of
quality. Quality is an objective term; homebrew is either well made or it isn’t.
Perception of quality, on the other hand, is subjective. The clarifying agents
outlined in this chapter, for example, help you produce crystal-clear beer.
Most drinkers perceive transparent beer as being better than cloudy or hazy
beer, but, in fact, a beer’s clarity has little bearing on its quality. A perfectly
clear beer isn’t necessarily well made, and a cloudy beer may be incredibly
well made. (Just something to keep in mind.)

To Add and Preserve
You can use a wide variety of other ingredients to affect the outcome of your
finished beer. These optional ingredients fall loosely into the additives and
preservatives category. Additives, generally speaking, affect the interactions
among the basic ingredients (malt, hops, yeast, and water) — how they
behave throughout the mashing, boiling, cooling, and fermentation phases of
homebrewing. Preservatives, generally speaking, preserve the character of
the beer you create. None of these products are absolutely necessary for
making good beer, but they can be helpful. The following list provides some
of these options:
 Amylase enzyme: This enzyme breaks down malt, barley, and adjunct
starches into soluble dextrins and small quantities of fermentable sugars
and therefore reduces chill haze in the finished beer. (Chill haze is a tem-
porary cloudiness that forms in beer when you refrigerate it; it’s caused
by the combination and precipitation [solids forming in and dropping out
of solution] of protein matter and tannin [a bitter compound derived
from organic matter — in this case, grain] molecules during secondary
fermentation. Chill haze usually appears around 36 degrees Fahrenheit
and disappears around 64 degrees Fahrenheit.) Although you typically
use it in all-grain beers, you can add amylase enzyme to any high-gravity
wort because it’s also effective at sustaining active fermentation. Add 1
teaspoon per 5-gallon batch.
 Burton salts: Burton salts is a generic name for a blend of natural 
minerals that emulates the brewing water in the English brewing city of
Burton-on-Trent. Burton salts increase the hardness of brewing water
(see Chapter 7 for more information on water hardness) and also help
prevent chill haze.
 Foam control: Foam control inhibits the formation of foam during pri-
mary fermentation, which means that your brew hangs on to the head-
forming compounds during the brewing process. Thus, the addition of
foam control results in denser heads when you pour the finished beer
for consumption. You can add foam control to the wort at the same time
that you add the yeast. One teaspoon per 5-gallon batch is all you need.
 Heading compound: This compound improves head retention in the 
finished beer and increases foam stability. One teaspoon dissolved 
in a half cup of water is sufficient for a 5-gallon batch. This compound is
available in both liquid and powdered form; the liquid form is more
expensive, but it’s also easier to work with than the powdered form. The
average homebrew shouldn’t need the assistance of artificial heading
compounds unless it has a very, very low original gravity or a very low
malt content.
92
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

The difference between foam control and heading compound is that
foam control suppresses natural foaming during fermentation and 
preserves it for pouring; the heading compound artificially increases
foaming in the beer.
The most popular heading compound is polypropylene glycol alginate,
which is derived from seaweed.
 Malto-dextrin: Dextrins are the (beer) body-building components of
malted grain; the more dextrins in the beer, the fuller the mouthfeel.
Malto-dextrin powder is a convenient shortcut to creating body and
mouthfeel in low-gravity beers.
 Yeast energizer: As the name suggests, this additive energizes old 
and tired yeast and is helpful for reviving stuck or slow fermentations.
Dissolve a teaspoon of energizer in a cup of boiling water, cool, and add
directly to the fermenter. To avoid having to open a sealed fermenter, try
anticipating the need for yeast energizer (such as in beers with original
gravities over 1.056) and add the energizer directly to the cooled wort as
you pitch your yeast (or to the secondary fermenter as you rack the
beer over to it). See Chapter 6 for more information on yeast energizers.
 Yeast nutrient: Typically, this type of product consists of di-ammonium
phosphate and nitrogen. This yeast fertilizer provides the yeast with a
balanced diet and is perfect for yeast starters and low-malt-content
worts. You can find more on yeast nutrient in Chapter 6.
A Little Clarification, Please
Regardless of whether you work with malt extracts or grains, whole hops 
or pellets, dry yeast or liquid cultures, a number of organic compounds are
floating around in your brew: proteins, starches, oils, resins, yeast cells 
basically, particulate matter of all shapes and sizes. Given time, most of this
stuff eventually settles out of your beer naturally. Time, however, isn’t a
friend to beer. This urgency is why brewers often resort to the use of clarify-
ing agents to impel this floating matter to clump up and fall to the bottom of
the fermenter. All clarifying agents can be considered preservatives since
they remove organic particles from the beer that might otherwise cause your
beer to eventually develop off flavors and aromas.
Generally speaking, what little particulate matter remains suspended in your
brew doesn’t initially affect the taste or aroma of your beer in an adverse
way; it mostly affects the visual presentation. Whether you want a clear beer
for competition purposes or for personal preference, clarifying agents can
help clear up your beer.
93
Chapter 9: Additives, Preservatives, Finings, and Clarifiers

Note: Beer filtration is an expensive option that’s open to you nonetheless; 
I discuss this procedure in Chapter 23.
Some of the clarifying agents in the following list are organic or mineral in
composition and have been used for eons (not to be confused with mineral
ions). A couple of these agents, such as Irish moss and isinglass, are called
finings. Finings do the same job as the other clarifiers — the rest are just
technologically advanced products of our modern era.
 Bentonite: Bentonite is a nonorganic material combined with a form of
powdered clay. Bentonite is more closely associated with winemaking,
but it also works well in beer. Just mix this material with water (accord-
ing to package directions) and add to the secondary fermenter a week
prior to bottling.
 Gelatin: Gelatin is derived from collagen in pork and cattle skin and
bones. It’s a colorless, tasteless, and odorless water-soluble protein 
that attracts negatively charged proteins and yeast. Gelatin works best
when you rehydrate it, pour it into cool beer, and give it 5 to 7 days to
accomplish its task after primary fermentation is complete.
Use 1 teaspoon per 5-gallon batch of beer. Dissolve the gelatin in 1 cup
of cool water and slowly heat over a low flame for about 15 minutes; do
not let it boil. Add the mixture to the fermenter immediately after it has
cooled.
 Irish moss: Also known as carrageen (and copper finings in the U.K.),
Irish moss is actually a form of brown seaweed. Because this substance
is a kettle-coagulant (meaning it works in the brew kettle), you want to
add it to the brew during the boil. Doing so causes a lot of the protein 
in the wort to coagulate as it cools. Irish moss comes in flaked and 
powdered form.
Because Irish moss requires a rehydration period in order to be effec-
tive, add 1⁄2 tablespoon of it to the wort in the last 15 minutes of the boil
(this amount is sufficient for a 5-gallon batch).
 Isinglass: Derived from the swim bladders of sturgeons, isinglass is 
perhaps the most unusual of the fining family of clarifiers; however, it’s
also highly effective. Isinglass (also known as white finings) attracts 
negatively charged proteins and yeast, causing them to settle out of the
beer. You use isinglass in the same way you use gelatin, but isinglass
may be a little harder to dissolve in water (follow package instructions).
This naturally gelatinous substance comes in powdered form, and 1 
teaspoon of this powder treats a 5-gallon batch.
94
Part II: It’s in There: The Nuts and Bolts of Beer 

Because isinglass finings have a charge opposite that of the other 
finings, you can use them in combination with some of the other finings
or clarifiers to improve beer clarification. By contrast, if you use two
similarly charged finings simultaneously, they interfere with each other’s
activity and actually impede beer clarification.
 Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP): PVPP is actually made up of minute
beads of plastic that are statically charged, which allows them to attract
particulate matter to themselves like electrostatic glue. Rehydrate the
PVPP in hot tap water for about an hour before stirring it gently into the
finished beer in the last few days of secondary fermentation. Another
positive quality of PVPP is that it’s very effective at combating chill haze.
Use 1⁄4 ounce per 5-gallon batch.
You don’t need to be concerned about having powdered plastic in your
brew. The largest consumer of PVPP is the pharmaceutical industry,
which uses it to produce capsule-type drugs.
 Silica gel: Silica gel is a hard, granulated form of hydrated silica that
works by absorption. Each particle is a hollow silica honeycomb with
pores just large enough to let haze-forming proteins in. As each particle
adsorbs the protein, the particle falls out of solution and forms a firm
sediment on the bottom of the fermentation vessel.
Silica gel is a lot like PVPP without the rehydration; stir silica gel into the
secondary fermenter a few days before bottling or kegging. Use 1⁄2 ounce
per 5-gallon batch of beer.
 Sparkolloid: Sparkolloid is a brand-name blend of polysaccharides and
diatomaceous earth. It’s popular in the winemaking industry, but you
can also adapt it to the clarification of beer. Heat 1 gram of Sparkolloid
per gallon of beer in water and then add it (hot or cooled) to your beer
as you transfer the brew from the primary fermenter to the secondary
fermenter.
 Super Kleer KC Finings: KC finings are an excellent all-purpose fining
agent that contains kieselsol and chitosan (derived from shellfish). Add
to secondary fermenter for clarifying within 12 to 48 hours.
 Whirlfloc: A blend of Irish moss and purified Carrageen that helps 
precipitate haze-causing proteins and beta glucans. Add one tablet (per
5 gallons of brew) in the last 15 minutes of the boil.
The famous beechwood-aged beers made by Anheuser-Busch supposedly
gain clarity from aging over large chips of beechwood. Kids — don’t try 
this at home.

Chapter 9: Additives, Preservatives, Finings, and Clarifiers

The Acid Test
Brewers can introduce a number of different acids to beer at various stages
in the brewing process; each acid has its own purpose (additive, preserva-
tive, or clarifier), and they should all be readily available at well-stocked
homebrew stores.
The following is a list of those acids and general descriptions of how they can
aid you in the beer making process. Exactly how you use these acids depends
on your needs (always follow package directions). For questions regarding
pH balance, see Chapter 7.
 Ascorbic: Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant, which qualifies it as a 
preservative. Ascorbic acid protects beer from the off aromas and tastes
associated with oxidation. This acid is also known as vitamin C. Use 1⁄2
teaspoon per 5-gallon batch (overuse lends a citrus flavor to your beer).
Add to beer at bottling time.
 Citric: Citric acid protects against haze, increases the acidity of brewing
water by lowering the pH, and aids in the fermentation process. You 
can also find it premixed in a product called Acid Blend, which is a 
convenient mix of citric, malic, and tartaric acids.
 Lactic: Lactic acid is a mild acid used to acidify (lower the pH of) 
the mash or sparge water. (See Chapter 12 for more on mashing and
sparging.) Lactic acid gives Berliner Weisse beer its characteristic 
tartness. When you use lactic acid, add 1 teaspoon per 5-gallon batch
just prior to bottling.
 Malic: Malic acid increases the tartness in beer. Like citric acid, you can
find malic acid premixed in Acid Blend.
 Phosphoric: You can use phosphoric acid in weak dilutions (approxi-
mately 1 part phosphoric acid per 10 parts water) to acidify mash water.
 Tartaric: Tartaric acid increases the tartness in beer and is also an 
ingredient in Acid Blend.

Part III
Ready, Set, Brew!

In this part . . .
T
his is where you actually make the beer, following 
step-by-step procedures. Chapters 10 through 12 cover
the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels of home-
brewing, and Chapters 13 and 14 illustrate the options you
have to package your brew once it’s done fermenting.

Chapter 10
Beginner Brewing Directions
In This Chapter
 Discussing the pros and cons of brewing with a kit
 Brewing step by step
 Reading hydrometers
M
y philosophy is that beginning brewers have to start somewhere (pro-
found, huh?), and that somewhere needs to be with an all-inclusive
homebrewing kit. A kit is simply a package you buy from a homebrew supply
store that includes all the ingredients (pre-hopped malt extract and a packet
of yeast) that you need to brew a particular style of beer. The kits I’m refer-
ring to here are ingredient kits only (as discussed in Chapter 4), mind you;
they don’t include any equipment.
But brewing beer from a kit also has a possible downside, depending on your
perspective. At the beginner homebrewing level, you the brewer have little
personal control over most of the beer-making process. (Practicing proper
sanitation is the glaring exception to this rule — see Chapter 3.) When you
use a kit, much of the thinking and the work have been done for you. (I like to
compare homebrewing at the beginner level to making soup from a can. Cold,
fizzy soup. Darn tasty soup.) Don’t get me wrong — this extra guidance is
good for those of you just starting out in the world of homebrewing who want
to work with a net the first few times through the process.
And so, in exchange for its simplicity, brewing at the novice level has its 
limitations. Making brewing easy means keeping it simple, and keeping it
simple means not using unusual ingredients or lengthy procedures. Because
you’ve relied on the malt extract producer to provide all the ingredients in
one tidy kit, many of the world beer styles can’t be faithfully duplicated at the
beginner level of homebrewing. Instead, what you find at the beginner level in
the beer recipe chapters in this book (see Part IV) are time- and effort-saving
hints and shortcuts for making a beer that comes reasonably close to the
intended beer style.

The two biggest pluses to brewing at this level are the speed at which you
can produce beer and the rapid rate at which you can conquer the learning
curve associated with it. The more quickly and cheaply you can produce
beer, the more you can make. The more you make, the more efficient you
become and, presumably, the more you comprehend about the nuts-and-
bolts of brewing. You can master several aspects of homebrewing (sanitation,
racking, observing fermentation, and bottling) at the beginner level. Thus,
another simple rule at the beginner level: The more you brew, the better 
your beer gets. It’s a delicious circle.
Gathering the Tools You Need
Before you start the brewing process, make sure you have all your homebrew-
ing equipment (see Chapter 2), you’ve properly sanitized it (see Chapter 3),
and it’s in place and ready to use. Here’s a quick equipment checklist for you:
 Airlock
 Brewpot with lid
 Brew spoon
 Coffee cup or small bowl (for proofing the yeast)
 Fermentation bucket with lid
 Rubber stopper (to attach to the airlock)
 Hydrometer (the hydrometer cylinder isn’t necessary at this time)
Now you just need a couple of simple household items to complete the
ensemble. Gather together a long-handled spoon or rubber spatula (for
scraping the gooey malt extract from the cans), hot pads (to hold onto hot
pots and pans), and a small saucepan (to heat up the cans of extract).
Speaking of which, be sure to have your homebrew kits on hand — your 
beer will be awfully watery-tasting without them!
I recommend either two 3.3-pound cans of pre-hopped malt extract (plus
yeast), or one 6.6-pound can. This is the appropriate amount for the average
5-gallon batch of beer. The style of beer or brand of malt extract is your
choice, but I give you suggestions in the appendix.

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

Brewing Your First Batch
Enough of the preliminary stuff. Here’s where the rubber meets the road —
it’s time to get brewing! This section walks you through the step-by-step
process of brewing at home. Just follow along and you can make great beer 
in no time.
The following numbered list covers 24 steps that walk you all the way
through the brewing process. Twenty-four steps may sound pretty intense,
but I assure you they’re easy, quick, and painless steps (unless you consider
turning on a burner to be exhausting work). Besides, when you’re done,
you’ve brewed your first beer!
1. Fill your brewpot about 2⁄3 full with clean tap water or bottled water
and then place it on the largest burner of your stove.
Use bottled water if your home’s water source is loaded with chlorine,
iron, or high concentrations of other trace metals. (See Chapter 7 to find
out more about the importance of good water.)
The exact volume of water isn’t terribly important during this step,
because you add cold water to the fermenter later to bring the total to 5
gallons.
2. Set the burner on medium-high.
3. Remove the plastic lids from the kits and set the yeast packets aside.
4. Strip the paper labels off the two cans of extract and place the cans in
a smaller pot or saucepan filled halfway with tap water. Place the pot
or saucepan on another burner near the brewpot.
The water’s purity isn’t important here because you don’t use this water
in the beer.
5. Set the second burner on medium.
6. Using hot pads, flip the cans in the warming water every couple of
minutes.
7. As the water in the brewpot begins to boil, turn off the burner under
the smaller pot (containing the cans), remove the cans from the water,
and remove the lids from the cans.
8. Using a long-handled spoon or rubber spatula, scrape as much of the
warmed extract as possible from the cans into the water in the 
brewpot.
9. Immediately stir the extract/water solution and continue to stir until
the extract completely dissolves in the water.
101
Chapter 10: Beginner Brewing Directions

This malt extract/water mixture is now officially called wort.
If you don’t stir the wort immediately, you risk scorching the extract on
the bottom of the brewpot.
10. Top off the brewpot with more clean tap or bottled water, keeping
your water level a reasonable distance — about 2 inches — from the
top of the pot to avoid boilovers.
11. Bring the wort to a boil (turn up the burner if necessary).
12. Boil the wort for about an hour, stirring the pot every couple of 
minutes to avoid scorching and boilovers.
Never put the lid on the brewpot during the boiling phase! Stove-top
boilovers occur regularly when a brewpot’s lid is on. Boilovers aren’t
only a sticky, gooey mess, but they’re also a waste of good beer!
13. Turn off the burner and place the lid on the brewpot.
14. Put a stopper in the nearest sink drain, put the covered brewpot in
the sink, and fill the sink with very cold water.
Fill the sink completely (or up to the liquid level in the brewpot if the
sink is deeper than the brewpot).
15. After 5 minutes, drain the sink and refill it with very cold water —
repeat as many times as you need until the brewpot is cool to the
touch.
16. While the brewpot is cooling in the sink, draw at least 6 ounces of
lukewarm tap water into a sanitized cup or bowl.
17. Open the yeast packets and pour the dried yeast into the cup or bowl
of water.
Called proofing, this process is a gentle but effective way to wake up the
dormant yeast and ready it for the fermentation to follow.
18. When the brewpot is relatively cool to the touch, remove the brewpot
lid and carefully pour the wort into the fermentation bucket.
Make sure the spigot is closed!
19. Top off the fermenter to the 5-gallon mark with cold, clean water,
pouring it vigorously into the bucket.
This splashing not only mixes the wort with the additional water, it also
aerates the wort well.
The yeast needs oxygen in order to get off to a good healthy start in the
fermentation phase. Because boiled water is virtually devoid of oxygen,
you need to put some oxygen back in by aerating the wort. Failure to
aerate may result in sluggish and sometimes incomplete fermentations.
102
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

20. Take a hydrometer reading.
See the section “Brewing day reading” in this chapter for specific 
information about this process.
21. After you take the hydrometer reading and remove the hydrometer,
pour the hydrated yeast from the cup or bowl into the fermenter and
give it a good brisk stir with your brew spoon.
22. Cover the fermenter with its lid and thoroughly seal it.
23. Put the fermenter in a cool, dark location, such as a basement, a crawl
space, or an interior closet.
Don’t put the fermenter in direct sunlight or where there’s a daily fluctu-
ation in temperatures, such as your garage. This temperature fluctuation
can mess with your beer’s fermentation cycle.
24. After the fermenter is in a good place, fill the airlock halfway with
water and replace the cap; attach the rubber stopper and position it
snugly in the fermenter lid.
Check to make sure that the fermenter and airlock are sealed airtight by
pushing down gently on the fermenter lid. This gentle pressure causes
the float piece in the airlock to rise; if it doesn’t, you have a breach in
the seal. Recheck the lid and airlock for leaks.
Fermentation should begin within the first 24 hours and last anywhere
from 7 to 10 days. This wait can be nerve-wracking for first-timers, but
patience is rewarded with great beer.
How quickly the beer begins to ferment and how long the fermentation 
lasts depends on the amount of yeast, the health of the yeast, the tempera-
ture at which the beer is fermenting, and whether or not the wort was prop-
erly aerated. Healthy yeast, mild temperatures (65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit),
and an abundance of oxygen in the wort make for a good, quick ferment. 
Old, dormant yeast, cold temperatures, and under-oxygenated wort cause
fermentations to start slowly, go on interminably, or even quit altogether.
After your beer has been in the fermenter for about a week or so, check the
bubbling action in the airlock. If visible fermentation is still taking place 
(as evidenced by the escaping bubbles), continue to check the bubbling on 
a daily basis. When the float piece within the airlock appears to be still 
and the time between bubbles is a minute or more, your beer is ready for 
bottling. Before you begin the bottling procedures, however, you need to 
take a second gravity reading to make sure that the fermentation is complete
(see the section “Prebottling reading” in this chapter for specifics on how to
do this).
Bottling beer before it’s done fermenting may result in exploding bottles.
Chapter 13 gives you the lowdown on this nasty mishap and how to avoid it.
103
Chapter 10: Beginner Brewing Directions

Taking Hydrometer Readings
I cover the purpose of a hydrometer and how to use one in homebrewing
extensively in Chapter 2. The following information shows you specifically
how to take hydrometer readings on brewing and bottling days. If you have
any lingering questions on this subject, please check out Chapter 2.
Brewing day reading
You want to take the first hydrometer reading on brewing day (see Step 20 
in the “Brewing Your First Batch” section of this chapter). To take a good
reading, do the following:
1. Lower the sanitized hydrometer directly into the cooled and diluted
wort inside the fermenter.
As you lower the hydrometer into the wort in the fermenter, give the
hydrometer a quick spin with your thumb and index finger; this move-
ment dislodges any bubbles clinging to the hydrometer that may cause
you to get an incorrect reading.
2. Record the numbers at the liquid surface on the hydrometer scales.
You need this information on bottling day to decide whether fermenta-
tion is complete and to figure out the alcohol content in your beer. 
The gravity of your malt extract and water mixture will determine the
numbers you’ll see on the scales. Typically, 6 or so pounds of malt
extract diluted in 5 gallons of water appear on the hydrometer’s O.G.
scale as 1.048, and the alcohol potential (as noted on the hydrometer’s
alcohol potential scale) is around 6 percent.
Prebottling reading
When you think your beer is ready for bottling (based on the bubbling action
in the airlock), it’s time to take another hydrometer reading. When compared
to the first (brewing day) reading, this reading helps you decide whether or
not your beer is actually ready to be bottled.
1. With your hydrometer test cylinder in hand, take a sample of beer
from the spigot of the fermenter.
Be sure to fill the cylinder to within 1 inch of the opening, leaving room
for liquid displacement of the immersed hydrometer.
104
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

2. Immerse the hydrometer in the beer, record the numbers at the liquid
surface of the hydrometer, and compare with those numbers
recorded on brewing day.
Remember that the average healthy yeast consumes at least 65 percent
of the available sugars in the wort. If the final gravity reading on your
fermented beer isn’t 35 percent or less of the original gravity, too much
natural sugar may be left in your beer.
Here’s a sample equation: If your beer has an original gravity of 1.048, sub-
tract 1 so that you have 0.048; then multiply .048 by 0.35, which results in
0.017. Now add the 1 back in. If the final gravity of your beer is higher than
1.017, you want to delay bottling a few more days.
105
Chapter 10: Beginner Brewing Directions
Calculating alcohol content percentage
Shown here is a sample equation to help you
figure out how much alcohol has been produced
in your beer during fermentation. If you find this
all a bit confusing, I suggest you check out the
sidebar “Of liquid density and hydrometers” in
Chapter 2.
Here’s a sample figuring for your first batch of
beer. If you use about 6 pounds of liquid malt
extract for your brew, your original gravity (or
O.G. in homebrew lingo) is in the neighborhood
of 1.048. If your yeast is good and hungry, your
final gravity (F.G.) a week or so later (after fer-
mentation) will be about 1.012. Because a ten-
forty eight (also acceptable homebrewer lingo
for the 1.048 gravity) represents an alcohol
potential of 6 percent, and a ten-twelve (the 1.012
gravity) represents an alcohol potential of 2 per-
cent, the yeast produced 4 percent alcohol in
your brew. (Subtract the final alcohol potential
from the original alcohol potential to derive the
alcohol content percentage.)

Intermediate Brewing Directions

 Conditioning your hair, er, I mean your beer
T
his chapter picks up where Chapter 10 leaves off, encouraging you, the
budding homebrewer, to get more personally involved in the brewing
processes and become less dependent on the malt extract producer. This
increased involvement means that you choose and add a variety of ingredi-
ents to create your brew, as well as perform other, more involved brewing
procedures.
Before attempting any procedures outlined in this chapter, I strongly 
recommend that you first read Beginning Brewing Directions in Chapter 10. 
If you already have, well, then, read on!
Taking Control of Your Beer
The basic differences between beginner and intermediate homebrewing can
be easily — but not completely — summed up in a few lines. Intermediate
brewers can
 Use specialty grains (to add more color and flavor in your beer).
 Choose and add hops (as opposed to using hopped extract).
 Use liquid yeast cultures (instead of freeze-dried yeast).
 Perform secondary fermentation procedures.
The combination of ingredient changes and new procedures can make a
world of difference in the quality of your homebrew. And you don’t even have
to apply these changes all at once.

Try to make your ingredient changes one at a time in successive batches of
beer. This staggered experimentation allows you to appreciate how each
process makes an incremental improvement in your beer.
Beer, as I discuss in Part II, basically consists of four simple ingredients: malt
(or barley), hops, yeast, and water. Brewers can use various combinations 
of these ingredients to produce a vast array of beer styles. But regardless of
how many variations of these basic beer-making ingredients you use, you 
can scientifically dissect all beer styles into three simple variables: color, 
bitterness, and gravity. These variables are defined by the ingredients that 
go into the brewpot: The color is defined by the grain (or malt extract), the
bitterness by the hops, and the gravity by the grain- or malt-extract-to-water
ratio. A fourth variable, responsible for defining the Ale, Lager, or Mixed-Style
classifications, is the yeast strain used to ferment the beer.
If you haven’t already found a source of good brewing water, by all means, do
so now. (See Chapter 7 to find out more about how to choose your water.)
Fooling Around with Ingredients
Your first step away from being a novice brewer is to take effective but 
simple measures toward improving your beer. The first of these measures 
has to do with adding more and better ingredients. (The second deals with
conditioning your brew differently. See the section “Conditioning for Better
Beer” in this chapter for more information.)
Whenever you buy homebrewing ingredients, make sure you store them
properly if you aren’t going to use them immediately. You need to refrigerate
all grains, hops, and yeast packets (freeze the hops if you plan to store them
long-term). Never allow any of your ingredients to lie around in a warm 
environment or in direct sunlight, even if they ask you nicely. Think of beer
ingredients as food products and think of how most food products decay
over time — especially in warmer environments.
Grain and strain
Specialty grains are typically those that are kilned (roasted) to various
degrees of roastedness after they’re malted (see Chapter 4 for more 
on malting) — and some aren’t malted at all (specialty malts come already
malted and kilned, so you don’t need to concern yourself with these
processes). Such grains don’t substitute for malt extract; they improve it 
by adding a variety of visual, aromatic, and taste enhancements as well as
head-retaining and body-building proteins and dextrins (see Chapter 4 for
more information on the function of specialty grains in beer making).
108
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

You can add all kinds of colors, flavors, and textures to your beer by adding
specialty grains to the brewpot — but don’t add them directly! Specialty
grains, like all other grains in the brewing business, are never boiled; you
should steep them at subboiling temperatures (160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit)
just long enough for them to yield their goods. Twenty minutes to a half hour
is sufficient.
Boiling grain can lead to a number of problems in your beer, not the least of
which is the harsh, astringent, tannin-like taste and mouthfeel that can ruin 
a whole batch of beer.
I suggest you crack your specialty grain, steep it in a separate pot, and then
strain it into the wort in the brewpot. Or, steep it in the brewpot before you
add the extract. And make sure you use a grain bag that acts like a big tea 
bag to allow the hot water to leech all the colors and flavors out of the grain.
With the exception of the most highly roasted grains, you always want to
crack, or mill, your specialty grains prior to the steeping procedures to maxi-
mize the flavoring potential of the grain. You have the added choice of buying
the grain already cracked or cracking it yourself at home. For the sake of
freshness, you really want to crack your own grain. If you choose not to buy 
a grain mill, you can still find inventive ways to mill your grain. Try putting
the grain into a self-sealing plastic bag and using a rolling pin to crush it
(even a baseball bat can do the job). The idea is just to crack the hard outer
grain husk, not to mill the grain into flour — don’t even think about using
your coffee grinder to do this job.
As an intermediate brewer with the ability to add color and flavor to your
beer by using specialty grains, you no longer need to buy amber or dark
extracts to make amber or dark beers. In fact, after you’re comfortable using
specialty grains, you’re better off deriving these colors and flavors from grain
anyway; the taste difference is appreciable.
Another great characteristic of specialty grains is that you don’t need to 
add a whole lot of them in order to influence the flavor of your beer. The
amount of specialty grains that most malt extract-based recipes call for rarely
exceeds 2 pounds. More often than not, at least half of the total amount of
specialty grain consists of crystal malt (also called caramel malt) — often con-
sidered an extract brewer’s best friend. Crystal malt is kind of an all-purpose
specialty grain because it can add color, mouthfeel, mild sweetness, and
caramelly grain flavor to beer all at once.
Hop to it
You can continue to exert your beery autonomy by making your own choices
in hop varieties and adding them as you see fit. Remember that about 50 dif-
ferent hop varieties grow around the world, and new or experimental cultivars
109
Chapter 11: Intermediate Brewing Directions

pop up regularly. Each hop variety offers different nuances in flavors, aromas,
and bittering intensity (see Chapter 5 and the appendix for more on hops).
The typical 5-gallon batch of medium gravity beer (1.040 to 1.050) rarely
requires more than 3 or 4 ounces of hops to achieve the desired bittering, fla-
voring, and aromatic profile. Of course, this estimation depends on the type
of hops you use (and their corresponding alpha acid contents) as well as the
style of the beer you intend to make.
You can add hops to the brewpot at any time; brewers typically add hops at
one-hour, half-hour, and quarter-hour increments (homebrew recipes typi-
cally specify which increments to use). What you want to get out of the hops
determines when you want to introduce them into the boil. Adding smaller
quantities at various intervals imbues your beer with a more complex aro-
matic, flavoring, and bittering profile than if you add a whole bunch all at
once. The following are very general guidelines for hop usage:
 You want to boil bittering hops for at least 60 minutes.
 You want to boil flavoring hops for 10 to 30 minutes.
 You want to add finishing (aromatic) hops in the last 5 minutes 
of the boil.
Regardless of whether the hops are pellets or whole leaves, you have the
choice of dropping them into the kettle loosely or putting them into a 
disposable or reusable hop bag. If you choose to throw the hops loosely into
the kettle, you need to strain the wort on its way into the fermenter. A hop
bag, on the other hand, works in much the same way as a tea bag: It allows
the hops to steep in the boiling wort without requiring you to strain them
later. Just use a strainer, tongs, or your brew spoon to remove the hop bag at
the end of the boil and toss its contents on the compost pile.
Hops and house pets can be a fatal combination. If certain dogs ingest 
discarded hops, they may develop a condition called malignant hyperthermia,
which manifests itself as heavy panting and a rapid heartbeat. Keep Fido —
and all pets, for that matter — away from your hop supply (new or used).
Check out Chapter 5 and the appendix for more information about hops.
Yeasty beasties
Yeast is another one of the ingredients that you can change and improve, 
and it’s also the fourth variable in the beer-making process (after gravity,
color, and bitterness). Yeast is largely responsible for how the finished beer
turns out. The time, effort, and high-quality ingredients you put into your
brew are all for naught if your yeast ruins everything.
110
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

Liquid yeast cultures may not come with guarantees of purity, but they 
measurably increase the quality of your beer. And you can’t dispute that the
stylistic variety that’s available in liquid yeast cultures is lacking in the world
of dry yeast.
A small downside to using liquid yeast products that aren’t ready-to-pitch 
is that you may need several days to increase the yeast quantity to the
proper pitching rate. So if you use liquid yeast, you may need to plan your
brewing itinerary in advance (if you plan to brew on Saturday, you better
start preparing your yeast by Thursday). Always read and follow the 
directions on the liquid yeast products you purchase. (See Chapter 6 for
more information on liquid yeast cultures and their preparation.)
Conditioning for Better Beer
As I mention earlier in this chapter, using different ingredients is only 
one way that intermediate homebrewers set themselves apart from the 
beginners. The other way is by using different methods of conditioning.
Conditioning means allowing your beer additional time to mature, mellow,
clarify, and carbonate.
Secondary fermentation
Secondary or two-stage fermentation is all about conditioning your beer. 
When you brewed at the beginner level, you put the fresh wort in the primary
fermenter, let the yeast do its thing, and then you bottled the beer. The beer
had about two weeks to condition in the bottle before you started sucking it
down. You did the right thing (within the limitations of your equipment and
expertise), but now you can do more.
At the beginner level, taking the freshly fermented beer out of the primary
fermenter was necessary not just because the initial fermentation was over,
but also because all those little yeasties, fresh from a gluttonous feast, were
about to start decomposing. That’s right, enzymes in the sugar-starved 
yeast begin to break down the yeast cells. This horrific event is called yeast
autolysis. Autolysis can impart a sulfury, rubbery stench and flavor to your
beer. So leaving your fresh, young beer sitting on that bulging layer of 
self-destructing yeast dregs is akin to allowing your child to wallow with 
pigs in the mud — and you don’t want to smell either one of them when
they’re done. Racking your beer over to a secondary fermentation vessel
effectively leaves most of the sedimented yeast and other organic matter
behind.
111
Chapter 11: Intermediate Brewing Directions

So if bottling the beer after one week worked before, why can’t it now? It still
can, but now that you’re introducing more ingredients into the brewpot, the
added flavors and textures in your beer need more time to blend together. By
allowing the beer to undergo a secondary fermentation, you promote a mel-
lowing process that makes a noticeable improvement in your beer.
Considering the advantages of secondary fermentation
Allowing your beer to age in a secondary fermenter before you bottle it also
reduces yeast bite, the harsh flavor and mouthfeel associated with having
excessive yeast sediment in the bottle.
Because the yeast has eaten most of the consumable sugars in the wort
during primary fermentation, secondary fermentation yields very little yeast
activity and rarely produces a measurable amount of alcohol. This second
fermentation period is just an opportunity for all the beer’s ingredients 
to acclimate to one another and establish a good, friendly (and tasty) 
relationship.
The secondary fermenter represents a world of new possibilities for your
brew. You can add many different additives and flavorings to the secondary
fermenter that may have a huge effect on the finished beer. (See Chapters 8
and 9 for ideas on what to add at the secondary fermentation stage.)
The two-stage aspect of secondary fermentation also allows you to perform
some real beer-improving feats:
 Dry hop: You can impart more hop aroma to your beer by simply adding
1⁄4 ounce to 2 ounces of hops (in pellet, plug, or whole leaf form) to the
secondary fermenter and then draining your beer over them. You can do
the same thing with spices, too. Chapter 5 has more information on this
process.
 Make true Lagers: In order to make genuine Lager beers, you must age
the beer in the secondary fermenter for at least a few weeks at very cold
temperatures (32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit) for proper flavor develop-
ment. (Check out Chapter 26 for ideas on how to set up a lagering
cellar.)
 Clarify your brew: You can add various clarifying agents to the 
secondary fermenter to speed up the process of clarification. Typical 
finings and clarifiers include isinglass, gelatin, Sparkalloid, and PVPP.
Chapter 9 gives you more information about finings and clarifiers.
One final vote in support of secondary fermentation: By using this procedure,
you can not only quit worrying about unfinished primary fermentations 
(and exploding bottles), but you can also actually cut the primary ferment
short by a day or two if that helps you rack the beer over to the secondary
fermenter at a more convenient time. This shortcut is possible only after the
peak fermentation activity subsides (usually by the fifth or sixth day of a
normal, healthy fermentation).
112
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

Jumping into secondary fermentation
Secondary fermentation always needs to take place in either glass or stain-
less steel vessels. A 5-gallon glass carboy is the most popular secondary fer-
mentation vessel, though a few homebrewers prefer to age their beer in
stainless steel soda kegs. However, I don’t recommend secondary fermenta-
tion in plastic vessels. Even the food-grade plastics used to make homebrew-
ing equipment are penetrable by certain gasses (such as oxygen) over an
extended period of time.
Remember that no phase of homebrewing is exempt from cleaning and sani-
tizing. When you add another fermentation phase, you must disinfect all the
equipment that goes along with it. In addition to the use of a good sanitizing
agent, you want to use a carboy brush to make sure you scrub the entire
inner surface of the carboy. Rinse the carboy well with hot water and allow it
to air-dry. Be sure to have an appropriately sized, sanitized rubber stopper to
seal the carboy, as well as an airlock. Don’t forget to sanitize all other equip-
ment, especially the plastic hosing, before you use it. If necessary, review the
sanitation methods I discuss in Chapter 3.
If you decide to use additives or flavorings and they’re liquids (or can be dis-
solved in water), you can simply pour them into the carboy prior to adding
the beer (which takes care of mixing). If your additive or flavoring is bulky or
leafy, you want to place it in a hop bag or some kind of filter for easy removal.
113
Chapter 11: Intermediate Brewing Directions
Propagation preparation
In anticipation of future brews, consider maxi-
mizing your time and consolidating your efforts
on behalf of imminent yeast propagations. In
plain English, that means instead of making one
small batch of sterile wort for propagating yeast
for a single batch of beer, try to make a lot of wort
and divide it into several bottles. You can store
these bottles of sterile wort for long periods of
time to be used for future yeast propagations.
Start with a half-dozen or so cleaned and sani-
tized bottles (you choose the size — larger is
better) with an appropriate number of sanitized
bottle caps. Prepare a medium gravity wort
(1.040–1.050) by using pale malt extract —
enough to fill all your bottles two-thirds full. Boil
and cool the wort, pour it into the bottles using a
sanitized funnel, and cap the bottles.
In order to ensure that the wort is completely
sterile, you must boil the capped bottles (this is a
crude form of pasteurization). To do so, place the
bottles in a deep pot and fill the pot with tap
water so that the water in the pot rises to the
liquid level inside the bottles. Place the pot on the
stove and bring the water to a boil; turn off the
heat immediately (be very careful during this
process; bottles have been known to burst!). To
avoid any possibility of thermal shock, allow the
bottles to cool down with the water in the pot —
this may take a while, so be patient. After the bot-
tles have cooled, dry them and store them in the
refrigerator. When you need to propagate your
next liquid yeast culture, you have good, sterile
wort ready and waiting.

This bag saves you some work, because you have to strain whatever you put
into the secondary fermenter out of the brew on bottling day.
Speaking of bottling, the procedure is delayed another week or two while the
beer is mellowing in the carboy. A secondary fermentation isn’t really worth
the effort unless you allow it to last at least one week. Two to three weeks is
the norm, and a month or more may be needed for Barley Wines, Imperial
Stouts, and other complex and high-gravity beers and Meads.
Before transferring your beer from the primary fermenter to the secondary
fermenter, you want to be sure that the initial, vigorous fermentation (also
called high kraeusen) is complete. You can do this check simply by watching
the bubbles in the airlock; if they appear at half-minute or longer intervals,
you can proceed with the following racking procedures.
1. Place your primary fermenter on a table or sturdy work surface and
position the empty carboy on the floor directly below the fermenter.
2. Connect one end of the plastic hose to the spigot on the primary 
fermenter and put the other end inside the carboy.
Be sure that you space the two vessels so that the dangling plastic hose
reaches the bottom of the carboy — this practice prevents aerating the
beer as you drain it. You may want to prop the carboy up on beer bottle
cases, a step stool, or large books (basically, anything that can with-
stand the weight of a carboy full of beer).
If you invest in a carbon dioxide kegging system, you can fill your carboy
with CO2 (because it’s heavier than air) before you rack the beer into it.
This practice helps limit oxidation of the beer. Just let the CO2 flow into
the carboy at 1 to 2 psi (pounds per square inch). (See Chapter 14 for
more about kegging.)
3. Fill the carboy with beer to within an inch or two of the opening.
In some cases, you may have to stop the flow of beer before it finishes
draining out of the primary fermenter; in other cases, you may have to
top the carboy off with clean water that you’ve boiled and cooled down.
What little water you may need to add doesn’t affect the beer’s gravity.
Speaking of gravity, you don’t need to take a hydrometer reading when
you rack the beer from the primary to the secondary fermenter, but if
you do you can get an idea of how your brew is progressing and how
long you need to consider leaving it in the carboy. Getting a beer sample
from the hose into the hydrometer test cylinder can be tricky and may
lead to a big mess if you’re not careful. The key is to control the flow of
beer with the spigot on the primary fermenter. Just remember to 
practice good sanitation and avoid aerating your beer.
4. Place the appropriate rubber stopper in the neck of the carboy, fill
your airlock halfway with water, and place it in the hole in the rubber
stopper.
114
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

5. Store the filled carboy in a cool, dark place for a couple of weeks.
6. Padlock the door to the room where you’ve stashed the carboy and
position a sentinel at the threshold. You’re just 14 days away from
some of the best beer you’ve ever tasted.
When you’re ready to bottle your well-conditioned brew you’ll have no
choice but to use siphoning procedures to drain the carboy, since carboys
don’t have spigots for convenience. Lucky for you, I’ve provided all the 
helpful information you need in the “Mastering the art of siphoning” sidebar.
Tertiary fermentation
Tertiary or three-stage fermentation is really no different from two-stage 
fermentation in its objective and procedure. Brewers don’t typically need to
115
Chapter 11: Intermediate Brewing Directions
Mastering the art of siphoning
The use of a carboy in homebrewing requires
you to practice your siphoning techniques,
because carboys don’t come equipped with
spigots. To perform such siphoning, you need a
curved racking tube (or cane) and your plastic
hosing. (I discuss racking tubes and other nec-
essary equipment in Chapter 2.)
The most effective siphoning occurs when the
opening of the siphon hose is lower than the
bottom of the vessel you’re siphoning the beer
out of (the lower the better). If you keep large air
bubbles out of the siphon hose, you also increase
the siphoning efficiency; air bubbles can actually
slow or stop liquid flow. They can also oxidize the
beer.
You can use a handful of ways to start a siphon,
but not all of them are appropriate for home-
brewing. For speed and simplicity, sucking on
one end of the siphon hose sure gets a flow
going, but it also opens the door to all kinds of
contamination possibilities. Some brewers feel
that a good gargle and rinse with whiskey 
or vodka prior to sucking on the hose is a good
temporary cure for this problem. Personally, 
I think it’s in bad taste (and so was that pun).
A better idea is to add a false end to the siphon
hose that can be removed as soon as the beer
begins flowing. A stiff straw, a piece of copper
tubing, or a short piece of small-diameter hosing
can be fitted snugly inside the siphon hose. After
starting the flow of beer by sucking the false end,
you can remove it and allow the flow to continue.
One brewer I know uses the cylindrical part of a
turkey baster to accomplish this. With the
baster’s bulb off and the thin end held tightly
inside the siphon hose, one good inhale and the
beer is flowing. (And no fowled beer!)
Another, more widely accepted practice is to fill
the plastic hosing with water just prior to fitting it
onto the racking tube. After you connect the tube
and hose (with the tube resting in the carboy), just
drop the open end of the hose into the bottling
bucket and the beer automatically starts to flow.
This method may take a few tries before you get
the system down. But what are a few beer stains
on the floor in pursuit of a healthy libation?

rack a beer over to a third fermentation vessel, but it may be useful under
certain conditions:
 If, after a prolonged secondary fermentation, you have a considerable
build-up of yeast sedimentation on the bottom of the carboy, tertiary 
fermentation can help you avoid the yeast autolysis problem mentioned
earlier in this chapter. This situation is only likely to happen in very
high-gravity Barley Wines, Russian Imperial Stouts, or other similar beer
styles. (Part IV gives you some insight on beer-style descriptions and
parameters.)
 If your beer has been sitting on real fruit in the secondary fermenter, 
you may consider a brief tertiary fermentation. Racking the beer off the
decomposing fruit before you bottle it may go a long way toward meld-
ing the fruit flavors into the beer as well as reducing the pectin haze that
the fruit often creates. (Pectin is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in
ripe fruit. Because of its thickening properties, it can solidify to a gel
that, diluted in your beer, can create a hazy appearance — called pectin
haze — in the beer.)
Keep in mind that every time you handle your brew, you increase the odds of
contamination. Always practice good sanitation techniques.

Homebrewing Directions for the
Serious Beer Geek
In This Chapter
 Discovering mashing procedures
 Comparing partial and full mashing
 Starting from scratch with all-grain brewing
 Increasing batch size
 Harvesting yeast
You’ve made it — you’re now at the advanced stage of the homebrewing
process! You’re pumped, you’re psyched — you’re ready to take the ulti-
mate step in homebrewing. The first and biggest step between the intermedi-
ate and advanced levels of homebrewing takes you from relying on prepared
extracts to making beer from scratch out of grain. The process integral to this
step is mashing — and, no, the process has nothing to do with boiling spuds.
After you master the mashing procedures that I outline in this chapter, you’ve
pretty much joined the ranks of the professional brewers. And even though
you’re still making beer in relatively small amounts, you are, for the most
part, unlimited as to where your talent, knowledge, and ability can take you.
Many homebrewers have gone on to new careers in the brewing industry;
some have even opened up their own microbreweries and brewpubs.
After mastering the science of producing beer from grain, many advanced
brewers (in their never-ending quest to achieve bigger and better brews) 
concentrate on the bigger picture (and pitcher). Five gallons of beer is no
longer worth the time and effort of brewing for these guys; 10 and 15 gallons
a crack — now that’s brewing! You may want to consider these possibilities
for yourself.
As I discuss in Chapter 11, after you graduate to another level of homebrew-
ing you must acquaint yourself with new procedures and new equipment —
see the section about advanced homebrewing equipment in Chapter 2.

In the first part of this chapter, I mention general brewing procedures. I cover
exactly how to perform these procedures later in this chapter. Also, be 
aware that your comprehension of this chapter relies on knowledge you gain
by reading the two preceding chapters — make sure that you check them 
out first.
Yes, We Have No Potatoes: 
Mashing Procedures
Put your potato peeler away; the kind of mashing I’m talking about is the
process by which you manipulate your grain to create and capture the 
natural grain sugars that feed the yeast during fermentation. At the beginner
and intermediate levels of homebrewing, you can cut corners by buying com-
mercially made malt extract (concentrated wort). By using mashing 
procedures, however, you make your own wort directly from grain.
How is mashing different from steeping specialty grains? As I discuss in
Chapter 11, you steep specialty grains primarily for coloring and flavoring
your beer, not for their contribution of fermentable sugars (which you get 
by mashing). In the absence of malt extract, you need base grains to 
produce the malt sugars that feed the yeast during fermentation. (As the
name implies, base grain is the foundation on which the beer is built.) The
production of these sugars from the grains takes place during the mashing
procedures.
The mashing process utilizes the naturally occurring enzymes in pale malts
to convert the starch to sugars. The malt sugars then become food for the
yeast during fermentation.
What do these enzymes actually do? Well, you can think of a starch molecule
as a bunch of sugar molecules arranged like beads on a string. These
enzymes cut the bonds (or strings) between the sugar molecules (the beads).
This process, called conversion, frees up the sugars so that the yeast can 
utilize them. Conversion occurs when enzymatic action in the mash tun or
vessel converts the starches in grain to soluble sugars that the yeast can 
consume.
Three important variables
You should consider the following three important variables in mashing:
118
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

 Temperature: In terms of the mashing temperature’s effect on the 
finished beer, higher temperatures (153 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit)
create a less fermentable wort, and, conversely, lower temperatures 
(148 to 153 degrees Fahrenheit) produce a more fermentable wort. This
knowledge enables you to exercise more control over the flavor and
mouthfeel of the finished beer. A more fermentable wort results in more
alcohol and less body in the beer. A less fermentable wort results in less
alcohol but more body and mouthfeel.
If you really must know, high mashing temperatures promote the action
of alpha-amylase, which produces less fermentable sugars than does the
beta-amylase promoted by lower mashing temperatures. Both alpha- and
beta-amylase are already present in malted grain.
 pH: As I discuss in Chapter 7, pH is the measurement of the acidity or
the alkalinity of the mash. The pH of the mash needs to be between 5.0
and 5.5 for the enzymes to work best. (I cover exactly how to adjust the
pH in the section “Easing into Mashing with a Partial Mash” later in 
this chapter.)
 Time: Time is the last variable; you must give the enzymes sufficient
time to work. Theoretically, 10 to 20 minutes is sufficient, but you gener-
ally want to give yourself some leeway — 60 to 90 minutes — to ensure
complete conversion.
Don’t worry — you don’t need to know how the mashing process works for 
it to work predictably every time. Just make sure that the temperature, pH,
and time are in order. After all, you don’t need to know the workings of 
internal-combustion engines just to drive a car!
Gimme some water: Simplified 
water treatment for mashing
I’m going to let you in on something: I’m making assumptions about you at
this point. I’m assuming that you’ve already brewed a few batches of beer
and you have a supply of good, clean, chlorine-free water with which to brew.
Fair enough? Now if you’re going to start grain brewing (mashing), you need
to take a few more water variables into account:
 The hardness of your brewing water: By hardness, I mean the amount
of minerals dissolved in the water. If you have a difficult time creating a
lather with soap, you can probably safely say that your water is hard 
(or that you need to find better soap).
Hard water isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Brewers specifically use hard
waters to create certain beer styles, such as Pale Ales, Dortmunder
Exports, and some dark beers. Excessive hardness, however, can be
detrimental to your brew.
119
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

One easy way to remove temporary hardness is to boil the water for 30
to 60 minutes and let it cool. (Boiling also offers the benefit of removing
chlorine.) After it cools and settles, siphon the water off of any precipi-
tated sediment. This process generally removes chalky (calcium carbon-
ate) hardness. See Chapter 7 for more information on water hardness.
 The pH of your mash water: To prepare mash correctly, you need a
mash-water pH of 5.7 to 6.3 (lower for pale beers and higher for dark
beers) because the acidity level of the mash will automatically increase
when the grist (grain) is added to the wort. How much it increases
depends on how much dark grain is added; dark grain is naturally more
acidic. Check the pH of your water — if it’s higher than 6.5, you need to
add gypsum and boil as you would to decrease temporary hardness
(which I describe in the preceding Tip paragraph). Because you may use
any one of so many different types of water, this process is not a cure-all,
but it tends to work well in practice for most types of water. Check out
Chapter 7 for more on manipulating water pH with additives.
Remember that the pH level is what’s most important for mashing proce-
dures to work correctly — the mash must be between 5.0 and 5.5 pH.
The actual mineral content is important, but not as important as the pH.
 The temperature of the mash: After mixing crushed malt with water,
you can generally expect a 10 degree Fahrenheit or so drop in tempera-
ture. This change means that, for a mash temperature of 150 to 158
degrees Fahrenheit, your mash water must be 160 to 168 degrees
Fahrenheit. (Coincidentally, this temperature range is the ideal sparge
or rinse water temperature.)
And then there were three: Mashing types
You have three basic types of mashing procedures. All three procedures 
are in use in the commercial brewing industry, and you can use any of them
at the homebrewing level. The following list describes these procedures:
 Infusion: This procedure is the most basic form of mashing (and also
the easiest). You just mix the crushed malt with water and stabilize the
temperature at 150 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit. You then measure and
adjust the pH to 5.0 to 5.5 and hold the mixture at that temperature 
level for 60 to 90 minutes. Infusion mashing requires that you use fully
modified (or Pale Ale) malts. This mashing method is primarily found in
use in Great Britain and most American craft breweries for making Ales.
(See the Infusion Mashing Procedure Flow Chart in Figure 12-1.)
The modification of the grain mentioned in the preceding paragraph
occurs at the malting stage (see Chapter 4 for more on malting). You can
purchase your grain according to your desired level of modification —
for example, 2-row English pale malts are typically more highly modified
than others (see Chapter 4 and the appendix).
120
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

 Step infusion (or multistep infusion): This mashing method is like 
infusion mashing but gives you even more control over the process. 
Mix the water and crushed malt as you do in regular infusion mashing,
adjust the temperature to 122 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit, and hold at
that temperature for 15 to 30 minutes; you then boost the temperature
to the starch conversion range (150 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit). This
process is a protein rest. Providing a protein rest enables other enzymes
present to break down large proteins in the malt to smaller proteins.
These smaller proteins contribute to body and head retention.
Generally, a protein rest is necessary only for less-modified malts, 
such as Lager malts.
The main advantage to the step-infusion mashing technique is control.
Generally, you apply heat or add boiling water to bring the mash
through the temperature rests. By judiciously applying heat, you can
control temperatures more precisely.

Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

 Decoction: This procedure is the most complicated and time-consuming
method of mashing. The basic procedure is similar to that of a step
mash in that the mash progresses through various temperature ranges.
You take the mash through these temperatures by pulling off the thick-
est part of the mash — grains and all — and boiling it in a separate
vessel. You then return this thick mash to the main mash to bring the
entire mixture to the next temperature rest. You can perform up to three
decoctions and temperature rests.
The main advantage to decoction mashing is that the boiling helps to
impart a rich, malty character to certain beer styles, such as Bocks,
Märzens, and Weizens.
Very few homebrewers use the decoction method of mashing, because
decoction mashing requires extra time, effort, and expertise. Unless
you’re trying to make truly authentic versions of these three beer styles,
this method is usually not worthwhile. For these reasons, I don’t cover
decoction mashing any further in this book.
The aftermash or mash-out
After you have completed conversion in your mash, you need to finalize the
mashing process by doing a mash-out. Regardless of which mashing method
you use, raise the mash temperature to 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit for
about 15 minutes after starch conversion is complete. (If water pH and 
temperature are right, complete conversion should occur after 60 minutes.)
You want to do so for the following two reasons:
 When you rinse the sugars from the grains, the thick and syrupy wort
flows faster at these high temperatures. (See the “Lautering” and
“Sparging” sections in this chapter.)
122
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Cereal killers: Cereal grain mashing
Many major industrial breweries, such as
Anheuser-Busch, Coors, and Miller, use raw
(unmalted) cereal grains to lighten the flavor,
body, and color of their beers — typically, light
Lagers. They first must boil the unmalted grain
(as with a decoction mash) to make the grains’
starch available to the enzymes. The brewers
then return the boiled grains to the mash for con-
version. Adjunct grains may include rice, corn,
rye, and oats.
For homebrewing purposes, however, buying
“flaked” adjunct grains is much easier and less
time-consuming; these grains are pregelatinized
(precooked) (see Chapter 4 for more on these
grains). In this form, you can simply mash them
with the rest of your base and specialty grains,
using one of the three methods mentioned in this
chapter.

 These temperatures also destroy the enzymes in the mash after the
enzymes accomplish their task. This enzyme destruction preserves the
degree of fermentability of the wort, which you purposely set with 
your mashing temperatures.
Lautering
Now for the question that you’ve been dying to ask: “After I create all these
liquefied sugars, how do I separate them from the grains?” Transfer the mash
into a lauter tun, a vessel with some sort of strainer or false bottom arrange-
ment and a tap for draining the wort away from the grain. (See Chapter 2 for
more information about lauter tuns.)
After transferring the mash to the lauter tun, carefully draw off the sweet,
syrupy liquid called first runnings. First runnings have a very high specific
gravity because they have a high concentration of sugars. Second runnings
(the residual wort rinsed from the grain during sparging) have a rather low
gravity because they’re heavily diluted by the sparge water. First and second
runnings achieve a more moderate starting gravity for your beer when you
combine, boil, and reduce them in the brewpot. (See the sidebar “Parti-gyle
brewing” later in this chapter.)
Unfortunately, these first runnings contain a lot of solid matter (grain husks,
finely ground malt, and so on). To make a stable beer, you must eliminate
most of this solid matter. How do you achieve this task? Just draw off the 
first runnings and recirculate them, or pour them back over the top of the
grain in the lauter tun. Recirculation relies on the grain husks to filter, and
thus clarify, the wort. Recirculate the wort through your grain bed only until
the wort begins to run clear. After you clarify the runoff this way, you can
drain it into the brew pot and rinse (or sparge) the grains.
123
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek
Parti-gyle brewing
Due to the nature of first- and second-run wort,
you can quite conceivably create two different
brews from the same initial mash by utilizing
parti-gyle brewing. A recipe with a very high
grain-to-water ratio can conceivably produce a
high-gravity first-run wort (such as a Barley
Wine or Old Ale) and still provide enough resid-
ual sugar in the second runnings for a low-
gravity beer (such as a Mild or a Bitter). To avoid
any dilution of the first-run wort and to minimize
dilution of the second-run wort, don’t increase
the beer volume of either brew to full batch size
(5 gallons or otherwise) — leave them as two
smaller partial batches. Parti-gyle brewing meth-
ods obviously require two separate fermentation
vessels as well.
The general rule says that the first third of the
wort contains half the sugars. Because a 50/50
split of the wort would leave the second-run wort
too weak, I recommend that you shoot for a 30/70
split.

Excessive recirculation of the first runnings may result in wort oxidation and
other off flavors that show up in the finished beer. Chapter 24 gives you tips
to combat such troubles.
Sparging
Sparging is rinsing the grain bed with hot water. Why do you need to 
sparge? Because the grain bed still retains a lot of liquid sugar after you 
collect the first runnings. You therefore need to percolate treated water 
(pH of 5.0 to 5.5, temperature of 165 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit) through the
grain bed. (I address the topic of water pH in Chapter 7.) You then collect 
the second runnings just as you do the first runnings (but you don’t need to
recirculate them).
Sparging is an important part of the mashing procedure because the process
enables you to maximize the grain yield by capturing most of the fermentable
sugars from the grain. (You get the most wort for your money.) You need to
be aware, however, that oversparging can negatively affect your brew’s taste;
see Chapter 24 for troubleshooting advice. When the sparge water you’re
pouring through the grain bed begins to run clear, you need to stop sparging.
(Two quarts of water per pound of grain in the recipe is the general rule.)
Easing into Mashing with a Partial Mash
The concept of partial mashing is to substitute some — but not all — of the
malt extract with pale malt to provide the fermentable material. You generally
continue to use specialty grains (crystal malt, roasted malts, and so on) in
the same quantities as you do in extract-based recipes (which appear in
Chapter 10).
Why do a partial mash rather than an all-grain batch (which I discuss in the
next section)? Partial mashing is a great way to familiarize yourself with the
mashing procedures for the following reasons:
 The smaller quantities of grain and water are easier to handle.
 You don’t need a large brewpot. (The brewpot left over from your 
beginner homebrewing days is fine.)
 You don’t need a lauter tun. (A kitchen colander or strainer is sufficient.)
 The entire process is less time-consuming and is generally easier if your
beer is not completely dependent on the mashing process.
To perform the following partial-mash procedures, here’s what you need:
 A bottling bucket or similar bucket (to hold wort).
 An 8- to 20-quart pot (in which to mash) — your brewpot is sufficient for
this purpose. Larger is better.
124
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

 A strainer or colander.
 A 2- to 10-quart stock pot (for holding sparge water). Larger is better.
 Some pH papers (you should always have plenty on hand because you
may need to check the wort several times) or a pH meter.
 A set of teaspoons.
 Gypsum (calcium sulfate). You should always have at least a teaspoon
on hand, but you may end up not needing any at all.
 Calcium carbonate (food-grade chalk). You should keep at least a tea-
spoon of this on hand as well, but you may not need any at all.
 A lab immersion thermometer.
 A grain mill (if you aren’t using preground malt).
 A postal or kitchen scale (to weigh the malt).
 Pale malt base grain. (For a beginner’s mash, 2-row Pale Ale malt is
preferable because it’s fully modified and thus easier to work with.)
 Other specialty grains as specified in your Ale recipe.
Here’s a step-by-step run-through of a partial mash:
1. Add 11⁄3 quarts of treated water per pound of grain (based on the
recipe you’re using) to your brewpot.
See the nearby sidebar “Adjusting pH levels” to prepare your water.
2. Heat your water to 160 to 168 degrees Fahrenheit.
This range is the strike temperature.
3. Add your crushed malt to the water and mix well.
A reminder about the correct crushing of your grain: As you crush the
malt, don’t grind it too finely — this only creates problems later. Just try
to crack the husk of the malt to expose the white, starchy interior. (This
step may take some careful adjustment of the mill to get it just right.)
Try to keep as much of the husk intact as possible.
4. Check the temperature of the mash (holding the thermometer in the
center of the mash for a more accurate reading).
Thermometers generally need about 10 to 20 seconds to register 
correctly.
The temperature should now be 150 to 158 Fahrenheit.
5. If the temperature is too low, apply heat while stirring constantly; if
the temperature is too high, add small amounts of cold water to bring
the temperature lower than 158 degrees Fahrenheit.
125
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

Watch for wort scorching, and don’t exceed 158 degrees Fahrenheit;
higher temperatures destroy the enzymes. If you do overshoot 158
degrees, add small quantities of cold water to bring the temperature
back down as quickly as possible.
6. After the temperature stabilizes, use a teaspoon to draw up some of
the liquid that’s on top of the grains and then let the liquid cool to
room temperature so that you can check the pH.
7. Following the instructions provided with the pH papers, dip the paper
into the mash sample contained in the teaspoon, read the pH, and
record the level in your notes (or simply use your pH meter).
Discard all used strips and wort samples.
Is the pH between 5.0 and 5.5? If so, you’re home free!
8. If the pH level and temperature are correct, cover the mash and hold
the temperature at 150 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit for 60 minutes.
Remember, if the pH level is not between 5.0 and 5.5, you must adjust it
to this range. The enzymes need this pH range to work correctly and
produce a well-made beer.
Check the temperature of the mash every 20 minutes. You may need to
adjust the temperature back into the 150 to 158 degree Fahrenheit range
by heating and stirring constantly.
During the last 45 minutes of the mash, you need to start preparing your
sparge water.
9. In a separate pot, heat two quarts of water per pound of grain (as
called for in your recipe) to 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
You use this water to rinse the grains. If you’re using water with a pH
level higher than 7.0, you need to lower the pH to between 5.7 and 6.5.
(Check the pH after every mineral addition.)
126
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Adjusting pH levels
How can you adjust the pH? If the pH is too high,
add half a teaspoon of gypsum and stir well.
Check the pH again, as I describe in Steps 6 and
7 of the nearby list. Repeat these steps until the
pH level is between 5.0 and 5.5. At any rate, don’t
add more than 2 teaspoons of gypsum to the
mash. Natural materials in the malt resist
changes in pH, so adding larger amounts of min-
erals doesn’t really change the pH. What if the
pH level is lower than 5.0? You simply add cal-
cium carbonate in the same way that you add
gypsum if the mash pH level is too high. (But
never add more than 2 teaspoons of any mineral;
if you are unable to reach a desired pH level by
using 2 teaspoons of mineral additive, you’re just
wasting money while negatively affecting the
taste of your beer.)

10. After starch conversion (after 60 minutes), raise the temperature of
the mash to 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit and hold for 10 to 15 
minutes.
This stage is the mash-out. After the mash-out, you need to strain out the
liquid (wort) and rinse the grains. This process is lautering and sparging.
11. Pour or ladle the mash into the strainer suspended over your bottling
bucket and let the sweet wort drain out of the grains.
This process may take a few minutes.
Don’t squeeze or press the grains to hasten the draining of the wort. Just
let gravity do the work naturally.
12. Next, put the strainer full of grain over your brewpot and recirculate
the cloudy wort in your bottling bucket back through the grains in the
strainer.
The grain filters out most of the minute solid particles in the wort.
Now it’s time to sparge.
13. Pour the hot (165 to 170 degree Fahrenheit) sparge water over the
grains to rinse away the sugars trapped in the grain.
14. After you pour out all the sparge water, let the grains that are still in
the strainer drain for 5 to 10 minutes into the brewpot.
You’re done! Just add the malt extract to the brewpot and brew as you nor-
mally would an all-extract batch (see Chapter 10). Now you deserve a beer!
127
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek
First Wort Hopping
First Wort Hopping (FWH) is an old yet recently
rediscovered process for adding hop character
to your brew. At the beginning of the sparging
process, you add hops to the brew kettle where
you collect the first runnings. The idea is that the
hops steep in the collecting wort (which usually
runs out of the lauter tun at temperatures ranging
from 150 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit, depending
on your setup) for the duration of the sparge; this
steeping produces a complexity of hop bitterness
and aroma that you can’t get by using any other
method.
One study among professional brewers deter-
mined that using FWH resulted in a more refined
hop aroma, a more uniform bitterness (no harsh-
ness), and a more harmonious beer overall (com-
pared to an identical beer produced without
FWH).
Your best bet is to use only low alpha finishing
hops for FWH and to use at least 30 percent of
the total amount of hops used in the boil. This
FWH addition should therefore be taken from the
hops intended for finishing additions. How’s that
for an odd reversal of hop additions?

Going All Out with All-Grain Brewing
Are you ready to brew beer from scratch? This procedure is the ultimate in
control for a brewer. All-grain brewing gives you complete control over the
entire malt flavor and source of fermentable material for your beer — 
something not possible if you use malt extracts.
The main difference between partial mashing and all-grain brewing is size —
more grains, more water, bigger brewpot, and so on are all necessary in 
all-grain brewing. I describe the three pieces of equipment you need to go
from partial mashing to all-grain brewing in the following list:
 A large brewpot: This item needs to be at least 7 gallons in capacity
because you’re collecting the entire volume of wort. Boiling the entire
batch volume is a full wort boil (6 to 7 gallons of wort boil down to the
typical 5-gallon batch size).
 A wort chiller: Because you’re boiling 6 to 7 gallons of wort, you really
need an effective way to chill the wort to pitching temperature (approxi-
mately 70 degrees Fahrenheit) within 30 to 45 minutes. Cold-water baths
in the sink just don’t cut it anymore.
 A lauter tun: This item is really a big, glorified strainer. Generally, this
vessel can hold 8 to 14 pounds of mash (crushed grain and water). It has
a false bottom with holes or slots that enable you to drain the sweet
wort from the grain.
Check out Chapter 26 for money-saving tips on how to make your own 
equipment.
Other than these changes in size and equipment, the mashing, runoff, and
sparging procedures are just about the same.
Note: If you haven’t done any partial mashing yet, refer first to the section
“Easing into Mashing with a Partial Mash” earlier in this chapter for terms
and concepts. (You have to walk before you can run.) In this section, 
I discuss in detail only the differences between the two processes.
Here’s a step-by-step run-through of an all-grain infusion mash; just follow
these steps:
1. Heat 11⁄3 quarts of treated water for every pound of grain in the recipe
to 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
See the section “Gimme some water: Simplified water treatment for
mashing” earlier in this chapter for details.
2. Mix in crushed malt and stir well.
This process is mashing in (sometimes called the dough-in).
128
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

3. Check the temperature (150 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and the pH
(5.0 to 5.5) of the mash and adjust as necessary to reach these levels.
4. Hold the mash at this temperature for 60 to 90 minutes to achieve
total starch conversion.
You may need to reheat mash to keep it in the correct temperature
range.
5. In the meantime, prepare 2 quarts of treated sparge water per pound
of grain.
See Step 9 in the “Easing into Mashing with a Partial Mash” section for
instructions on treating sparge water.
6. After starch conversion, raise the temperature of the mash to 160 to
170 degrees Fahrenheit and hold for 10 to 15 minutes.
This step is the mash-out.
7. Carefully ladle or pour the mash into your lauter tun.
8. Into a sauce pan, very slowly draw off 1 or 2 quarts of the wort from
the spigot or hose at the bottom of the lauter tun and then take the
sweet wort (first runnings) and pour (or recirculate) it over the top of
the grain bed.
Continue until few or no solid particles appear in the runoff. This task
may take 1 or 2 gallons of wort to accomplish.
Try to keep splashing and frothing of the wort to a minimum. You can do
so by always using a piece of hose connected to the spigot on your
lauter tun. Never let the wort just waterfall into the saucepan as you
recirculate or sparge, because doing so can cause aeration of the wort,
which can result in off flavors and aromas (and a beer that goes stale
more quickly).
9. After the first runnings clear up, start letting the wort drain slowly
into your brewpot.
This process should take 10 to 15 minutes. Use a long length of plastic
hose to let the wort drain gently into the bottom of the brewpot — and
make sure you avoid aerating the wort.
If the wort runs off too fast, the grains may compact down on them-
selves. If that happens, you get what’s called a stuck runoff, which is one
huge pain in the mash! You can’t drain any more wort from the mash.
The only solution is to stir the entire mash and start the runoff again.
10. Carefully watch the level of the wort above the grains and, after the
level is about 1⁄2 inch above the top of the grain bed, begin to add your
sparge water, which should be 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
To add the sparge water, pour about 2 to 4 quarts at a time periodically
over the grain. (Don’t overfill the lauter tun.)
129
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

11. Continue to add the sparge water and run off the resulting wort over
the course of the next 45 to 60 minutes.
Slower is better in this process.
Always keep some sparge water above the top of the grain bed. Don’t let
the grain bed run dry! After you use all the sparge water, you then — and
only then — let the grain bed run dry.
If you run off and sparge too fast, not only can you get a stuck runoff, but
you may not extract enough sugar from the grains, which can result in
lower-than-expected original gravities.
12. After you’ve added all the sparge water, just let all the liquid in the
lauter tun drain into the brewpot and then close the tap and clean out
the grain in the lauter tun.
You should collect 6 to 7 gallons of wort. The grain left in the lauter tun
makes great garden mulch or hog slop.
At this point, you may want to consider first wort hopping procedures
(see the “First Wort Hopping” sidebar)
Carefully put the brewpot on the stove — remember that you have 6 to 7
gallons of hot wort in there. This amount of wort weighs more than 50
pounds.
13. Bring the wort up to a boil and boil for 60 to 90 minutes to reduce the
volume of the wort to 5 to 51⁄2 gallons; add hops and other ingredients
per the recipe.
You may need to experiment with the actual boil time to boil off just the
right amount of water to get 5 to 51⁄2 gallons of wort. This variation
occurs because everyone’s stove or heating apparatus is different.
14. Fifteen minutes before the end of the boil, put your rinsed immersion
wort chiller into the brewpot and bring the wort back up to a boil.
This step effectively sterilizes the chiller (see Figure 12-2). (If you’re
using a counter-flow-type wort chiller, don’t immerse it in the wort.) See
Chapter 2 for more information on wort chillers.
15. Add 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss to the wort.
This clarifying agent helps clear the finished wort. (See Chapter 9 for
more on clarifiers.)
16. Finish boiling the wort and, after the boiling is done, hook up the
wort chiller to your sink and cover the brew pot.
17. Run cold water through the chiller to cool the wort to lower than 80
degrees Fahrenheit.
You’re probably going to need to move your hot and heavy brewpot to a
location nearer your faucet and sink — do so carefully.
The preferred method is to chill your wort to the same approximate tem-
perature as your yeast culture — typically, room temperature.
130
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

The water exiting the wort chiller is very hot (180 degrees Fahrenheit
and hotter)! Be very careful, because this water can easily scald you.
18. Siphon or pour the cooled wort into a sanitized fermenter.
As you do so, try to introduce as much air into the cooled wort as possi-
ble to aerate it for the necessary yeast growth. You can do so by pouring
the wort vigorously into the fermenter and by rapidly stirring the wort
with your brewing spoon.
19. Pitch your yeast (just pour it into the wort) and attach the airlock (just
like with any other type of brew).
20. Have a beer.
Congratulations! You’re now an all-grain brewer.
Increasing Your Batch Size
Many homebrewers, after mastering the mashing techniques of all-grain
brewing, find themselves in need of yet another challenge. Of course, in addi-
tion to experiencing the thrill and satisfaction of achieving a formidable goal,
most homebrewers are also primarily interested in serving a common 
need — making more beer!

Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

That the mashing procedures I outline in this chapter require more knowl-
edge, effort, and, perhaps most important, time than other brewing proce-
dures do is obvious. Because of time considerations, many all-grain brewers
try to maximize their brewing sessions by brewing a greater volume of beer
at one time. All things considered, this practice makes perfectly good sense.
Formulating the recipes for these increased batch sizes is no big deal.
Increases in ingredients correspond to increases in the number of gallons 
you want to brew — the ratios don’t change. To brew larger volumes of beer,
however, you need equipment capable of handling those larger volumes: a
bigger brewpot, a bigger lauter tun, and a larger fermenter (or more fer-
menters). Other considerations include a burner or heating element capable
of bringing larger volumes of liquid to a boil (and adequate venting of such
equipment), greater volumes of yeast slurry for fermenting bigger batches of
beer, and lots of available bottles or kegs for packaging and storing your
bodacious brews.
132
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Do’s and don’ts for all-grain brewing
Brewing can get pretty hectic with all that
equipment sitting around and ingredients every-
where. The following list may help make your
brewing experience go a bit more smoothly.
Note: A fitting complement to reading this list
may be to have a cold one from your last batch
before beginning this batch.
The following list describes a few things you
need to do:
 Sanitize and sterilize everything that comes
in contact with your beer!
 Treat the mash for the correct mash pH.
 Grind the malt correctly.
 Stir the mash well.
 Use a wort chiller.
 Use ready-to-pitch liquid yeast cultures.
 Aerate the cooled wort well.
 Use secondary fermentation techniques.
The following list describes several things not
to do:
 Allow the beer to become contaminated.
 Overgrind the malt.
 Boil the grain.
 Mash or sparge with alkaline water.
 Oversparge the grain.
 Add too many minerals to your mash.
 Scorch the mash.
 Aerate hot wort.
 Pitch yeast into hot wort.
 Aerate fermented wort.
 Let the fermented beer sit on the yeast too
long.
 Get too serious — it’s still a hobby!

At this point in the brewery expansion, the kitchen becomes, for most
people, obsolete. Handy and inventive brewers like to move their operations
into a large laundry room, the basement, or a garage.
And on goes the argument about whether a beer geek really is committed or
really should be.
Harvest Time: Reusing Your Yeast
After brewers progress to greater levels of brewery output, as I mention in
the preceding section, yeast again becomes an issue. Because larger batches
of beer require greater volumes of yeast slurry to achieve correct pitching
rates, you must factor cost and effort into the brewing requirements.
Buying more packages or test tubes of sterile yeast culture for each batch
that you brew may be an intelligent option but certainly isn’t frugal. Yeast
propagation is a smart option but may require multistep propagation 
procedures to achieve the desired pitching rates.
At this time, you may want to consider the possibilities of collecting yeast
from a healthy fermentation to repitch in your subsequent brews. After 
primary fermentation is complete, harvesting the yeast from the fermenter is
a simple matter. Here’s all you need to do:
1. Prepare a sanitary jar with stopper and airlock per the starter culture
instructions in Chapters 11 and 26.
You use this vessel for collecting and storing the yeast.
2. Drain the fermented beer from your primary fermenter into a bottling
bucket, carboy, keg, or whatever you normally use.
3. Remove the siphon tube and put the cover back on the primary 
fermenter.
4. Sanitize a ladle or spoon and dig yeast off the bottom of the fer-
menter; then pour the yeast into the jar and seal it with the airlock.
Try to collect 4 to 8 ounces of yeast slurry/sediment.
5. Put the jar in the refrigerator if you’re not planning on using it right
away.
You may store the yeast this way for a week or two, maximum.
6. To reuse the yeast after refrigeration, take the jar out of the fridge and
let it warm to room temperature.
7. Swirl the slurry and pitch it into the cooled wort of your next batch.
133
Chapter 12: Homebrewing Directions for the Serious Beer Geek

Before reusing the yeast, taste a sample of the brew you took it from.
(Hydrometer reading samples are great for this task.) If the beer tastes conta-
minated, the yeast slurry is also contaminated. Reusing the yeast from an
imperfect batch of beer makes no sense. I don’t recommend reusing yeast
more than two or three times either, but let your taste of the subsequent beer
be your guide and don’t ever become lax on the rules of sanitation.

B
ottling homebrew isn’t a difficult procedure, but brewers often deride 
it as one that’s tedious at worst and boring at best. But for millions of
people who brew their beer at home, bottling represents the only option for
packaging their finished brew.
The key to breaking the tedium is to get your system down to a science —
and to drink a brew while you’re bottling one. (Kind of like whistling while
you work, except that you’re sucking brew and not blowing air.) The more
you go through the bottling steps, the more familiar they become, and 
then you can begin to anticipate your next move. Having all the necessary
equipment sanitized and ready to go before you begin any of the bottling 
procedures is especially handy.
Picking Out Bottles
Using good, sound, safe bottles is an important part of the bottling process.
Your beer may start out as a world-class brew, but if the bottles aren’t
worthy, you can end up with leakers, exploders, and sticky messes. When
you’re buying bottles, don’t skimp.
Bottles come in all sizes and shapes, but before I delve into the various
choices, I want to give you a few very important suggestions. Your homebrew
bottles
 Should be the thick, returnable type (no cheap throwaways). The
thick, returnable-type bottles can withstand repeated uses; cheap 
throwaways mean thin glass and easy breakage.

 Should be made of colored glass (the darker the better). Light damages
beer; tinted glass protects against light damage.
 Shouldn’t have a twist-off opening. Bottle caps can’t seal across the
threads on twist-off bottles.
 Should be of uniform size. Although uniform bottles aren’t a require-
ment, having all your beer in bottles of the same size and shape makes
capping and storing much easier.
Even within these parameters, you still have a fairly wide choice in usable
bottles; however, availability may become an issue. You can easily purchase
brand-new 12- and 22-ounce bottles through homebrew supply shops, but the
cost is sometimes prohibitive — if not for the bottles themselves, for the cost
of having them shipped across the country if you don’t have a local supplier.
Check with your local microbrewers (if you have any); you may be able to
buy bottles directly from them.
The American brewing industry continues to package beer — albeit in limited
markets — in a variety of 7-, 12-, 16-, and 22-ounce and quart-size returnable
bottles; check with your local beer retailer. A few European brewers package
their export beer in reusable bottles; the popular 17-ounce Weizenbier 
bottles are a good option.
Using larger bottles is a way to expedite the bottling process as well as free
you from its drudgery. The more beer the bottles can hold, the fewer bottles
you need. For instance, to bottle an entire 5-gallon batch of beer in 7-ounce
nip bottles, you need to clean, fill, and cap more than 90 of them. If you use
22-ounce bottles, on the other hand, you need only 30 of them.
Homebrewers should also be aware that homebrewing competitions place
strict limitations on the size and color of bottles allowed in competition. 
For more information on homebrew competitions, check out Chapter 25.
Ready, Set, Bottle!
Before you start any bottling procedures, take a hydrometer reading of the
beer in the fermenter to verify that fermentation is sufficiently complete. Just
steal a little beer out of the spigot to fill the hydrometer cylinder to within an
inch of the top (but no more). (See Chapter 2 for complete directions on
taking hydrometer readings.)
After you take your hydrometer reading, don’t pour the beer from the 
cylinder back in with the rest of the beer — if you do so, you risk contaminat-
ing your beer. But don’t throw the sample down the sink, either. It may be
uncarbonated, but it’s still good beer — drink it! You may be surprised to 
find out how good it already tastes.

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

After you’ve made certain that the beer is done fermenting, retrieved the 
bottling equipment, and quarantined the family pets, you’re ready to start the
bottling process. As always, setup starts with sanitizing all the necessary
equipment, which includes the following:
 A bottling bucket
 A racking cane (if bottling from a vessel without an attached spigot)
 A plastic hose
 A bottling tube (with spring-action or gravity-pressure valve)
 Bottles (enough to hold 640 ounces of beer)
 Bottle caps (enough to cap all your bottles, plus some extras — just 
in case); see “Crowning Achievements” later in this chapter for 
more on caps
You need to sanitize all of these items before bottling, so you also need a 
sanitizing agent; for more information on sanitizing and sanitizing agents, see
Chapter 3. You also need the following:
 A bottle brush
 A bottle rinser
 A bottle capper
 Two small saucepans
 Dextrose (corn sugar) for priming — 3⁄4 cup; see “A Primer on Priming”
later in this chapter
 A beer to drink
Now, here are the steps for the bottling brigade:
1. Fill your utility tub or other designated sanitizing basin with enough
cold water to cover your submerged bottles, adding bleach or another
sanitizing agent according to the package directions.
2. Submerge as many bottles as you need to contain your full batch of 
5 gallons of beer.
Make sure your bottles are scum-free before dunking them in the sanitiz-
ing solution. Any bottle with dried or living crud in the bottom needs to
be scrubbed separately with a cleanser such as trisodium phosphate
(TSP) before you sanitize it.
You can fill and submerge the bottles in less than half the time if you
place a drinking straw in the bottles; the straw enables the air within the
bottle to escape through the straw instead of slowly bubbling through
the opening (your bottling tube with the valve detached suffices here).
137
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew

3. Allow your bottles to soak for at least half an hour (or the time neces-
sary according to package directions).
4. Crack open your bottle of beer.
5. While the bottles soak, dissolve 3⁄4 cup of dextrose in a pint or so of
water in one of the saucepans, cover the solution, and place it on a
burner over low heat.
6. Put your bottle caps into your other saucepan, fill the pan with
enough water to cover all the caps, and place the pan on another
burner over low heat.
Put enough bottle caps for as many bottles as you have soaking plus a
few extra; having too many sterilized caps ready for bottling is better
than not having enough.
7. Allow both pans to come to a boil, remove them from the heat, and
allow them to cool.
8. After the bottles soak for half an hour, connect the bottle rinser to the
faucet over the sanitizing tub.
9. With one hand over the opening (so that you don’t get squirted), turn
on the hot water.
After the initial spray, the bottle washer holds back the water pressure
until a bottle is lowered over the stem and pushed down.
10. Start cleaning the bottles one-by-one with the bottle brush, and then
drain the sanitizer, rinse your bottles with the bottle rinser, and allow
them to air dry.
Continue this step until all bottles are clean.
Visually check each bottle for cleanliness rather than just assume that
they’re all clean.
Four dozen free-standing bottles make one heck of a breakable domino
effect. Always put your cleaned bottles back into six-pack holders or
cardboard cases to avoid an aggravating and easily avoidable accident.
11. Take a sip of beer.
12. Drain the utility tub of the bottle-cleaning water.
13. Place the bottling bucket in the tub and fill it with water and the 
sanitizing agent of your choice.
14. Place the bottling hose, bottling tube, and hydrometer cylinder into
the bottling bucket and allow them to soak for half an hour (or 
according to sanitizing agent directions).
15. While the bottling equipment soaks, retrieve the still-covered fer-
menter from its resting place and place it on a sturdy table, counter,
or work surface about 3 or 4 feet off the ground.
138
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

At this point, you need to set up your bottling station, making sure that
you have the priming sugar mixture (still in the saucepan), bottle caps,
bottle capper, bottles, and hydrometer with cylinder on hand.
If you’re bottling your brew directly from the primary fermenter, you
want to have already taken a hydrometer reading to confirm completion
of fermentation. If you’re bottling from your secondary fermenter (glass
carboy), incomplete fermentation isn’t a concern, and you can take a
hydrometer reading (to determine final gravity and alcohol content) as
the beer drains into the bottling bucket.
16. After half an hour, drain the sanitizing solution from the bottling
bucket through the spigot on the bottom and, after the bucket is
empty, thoroughly rinse the remaining pieces of equipment (hose, 
bottling tube), along with the bottles and caps, and bring them to your
bottling station.
17. Take a sip of beer.
18. Place the bottling bucket on the floor directly below the fermenter
and connect the plastic hosing to the spigot on the fermenter, allow-
ing the other end of the hosing to hang inside the bottling bucket.
If you’re initiating the bottling procedures from your glass carboy, you
can’t rely on the convenience of a spigot to drain out the beer. You need
to use your racking cane and siphon the brew. Chapter 11 explains
siphoning procedures in more detail.
19. Pour the dextrose and water mixture into the bottling bucket.
The dissolved corn sugar mixes with the beer as the beer drains from 
the fermenter into the bottling bucket. After you’ve bottled the beer, this
sugar becomes another source of food for the few yeast cells still remain-
ing in the liquid. As the yeast consumes the sugar, it produces the beer’s
carbonation within the bottle. Eventually, the yeast again falls dormant
and creates a thin layer of sediment on the bottom of each bottle.
If, by chance, you bottle a batch of beer that isn’t fully fermented or 
you somehow add too much dextrose at bottling time, you may find 
out first-hand what a mess exploding bottles can make. Excess sugar
(whether added corn sugar or leftover maltose from an unfinished fer-
mentation) overfeeds the yeast in an enclosed bottle. With nowhere for
the pressure to go, the glass gives before the bottle cap. Kaboom! Mess!
Do not overprime. (Use no more than 3⁄4 cup of dextrose in 5 gallons of
beer.) See the “A Primer on Priming” section in this chapter for more
advice on priming.
20. Open the spigot on the fermenter and allow all the beer to run into
the bottling bucket.
Don’t try to salvage every last drop from the fermenter by tilting it as
the beer drains down the spigot. The spigot is purposely positioned
about an inch above the bottom of the fermenter so that all the spent
yeast and miscellaneous fallout remains behind.
139
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew

21. After the last of the beer drains, close the spigot, remove the hose,
and rinse it.
Avoid splashing or aerating your beer as you bottle it. Any oxidation
that the beer picks up now can be tasted later. Yuck.
22. Carefully place the bottling bucket up where the fermenter was, con-
nect the rinsed hose to the spigot on the bottling bucket, and attach
the bottling tube to the other end of the hose.
23. Arrange all your bottles on the floor directly below the bottling
bucket (keeping them all in cardboard carriers or cases to avoid
potential breakage and spillage).
24. Open the spigot on the bottling bucket and begin to fill all the bottles.
Gently push the bottling tube down on the bottom of each bottle to start
the flow of beer. The bottle may take a short while to fill, but the process
always seems to accelerate as the beer nears the top. Usually, a bit of
foam rushes to the top of the bottle; don’t worry! As soon as you 
withdraw the bottling tube, the liquid level in the bottle falls.
25. Remove the tube from each bottle after foam or liquid reaches the top
of the bottle.
Figure 13-1 shows you how full you want your bottles to be.
After you remove the bottling tube from the bottle, the level of the beer
falls to about an inch or so below the opening. Homebrewers have differ-
ing opinions as to how much airspace (or ullage) is necessary. Some say
the smaller the airspace, the less oxidation that can occur. Others claim
that if you don’t have correct ullage, the beer can’t carbonate properly.
Rather than jump into the fray, I say if it looks like the space in bottles 
of beer from commercial breweries, go with it!

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

26. After you completely drain the bottling bucket, close the spigot,
remove the hose, toss it inside the bottling bucket, and set everything
aside to be cleaned after all the bottling procedures are complete.
27. Place all the bottles on your tabletop or work surface; place a cap on
each bottle, position your bottles in the capper (one at a time), and
pull down on the capper handle or levers slowly and evenly.
You may want to do this task as soon as each bottle is full as insurance
against everything that can go wrong when full bottles of your precious
brew are sitting around open.
Both bench- or two-handle-style cappers come with small magnets in the
capper head designed to hold and align the cap as you start crimping. 
I don’t trust the magnet to hold the caps in alignment and prefer to seat
them on the bottles by hand.
Occasionally, a cap may crimp incorrectly. If you suspect that a cap
didn’t seal right, tilt the bottle sideways and check for leakage. If you
find you have a leaker, yank the cap and replace it. (You boiled 
extras — right?)
28. Your homebrew needs to undergo a two-week conditioning phase, so
store your liquid lucre in a cool, dark location (such as the same place
that you kept the fermenter).
This phase is where the remaining yeast cells chow down on the dextrose
and carbonate your beer.
Putting your brew in the fridge isn’t a good idea — at least for the first
two weeks — because the very cold temperatures stunt the yeast’s 
carbonating activity.
29. You must thoroughly rinse your brewing equipment in hot water 
and store it in a place that’s relatively dust- and mildew-free. You may
even want to go that extra step and seal all your equipment inside 
a large-capacity garbage bag.
This step may be the most important one of all, not so much for 
the brew just made but for the next one. Consider this step an insurance
policy on your next batch of beer. Boring but worthwhile, like most
insurance policies.
30. Finish drinking your beer (if you haven’t already).
After two weeks pass, check to see whether the bottles have clarified (the
yeasty cloudiness has settled out). Chill a bottle or two for taste-testing. Like
any commercial beer, you need to decant homebrew before drinking, not only
to release the carbonation and the beer’s aromatics but also to pour a clear
beer. Drinking homebrew out of the bottle stirs up the sediment, creating 
a hazy beer. (See Chapter 22 for more information on proper decanting 
practices.)
141
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew

Tanks a Lot! Bottling Kegged Beer
If you invest in a CO2 system for kegging your beer, you may appreciate the
ways you can use a CO2 system for certain bottling applications, too. To get
the lowdown on CO2 kegging systems for homebrewing, check out Chapter 14.
For all its convenience and time- and effort-saving simplicity, kegging 
homebrew does have some limitations. What happens if you want to take 
a sample of your beer over to friend’s home on poker night? What happens 
if you want to send a beer out to a homebrew competition in another state?
You probably don’t want to lug your kegging system over to your buddy’s
house, and having your kegged beer evaluated at faraway competitions is 
out of the question. Or is it?
Carbon-aid: Sharing kegged 
beer in plastic bottles
One enterprising company has created a simple little device called The
Carbonater valve coupling. This plastic thingamajig is designed like a 
ball-lock fitting on a soda keg, and it’s threaded so that you it can screw it
onto plastic soda bottles. You can dispense some of your kegged beer into 
a plastic soda bottle, seal the bottle with The Carbonater cap, and pressurize
the soda bottle to maintain the carbonation in the beer. Of course, you have
to remove The Carbonater cap each time you want to pour beer from the
bottle.
142
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Swingtime
If you’re looking to save a few bucks on bottle-
capping equipment and a little time on bottling
procedures, you may want to consider packag-
ing your brew in the swing-top bottles known as
Grolsch bottles. These bottles aren’t only unique
in style, they also provide you the advantage of
not needing to commit to drinking a full bottle at
one sitting because they’re self-sealing.
You do face some negatives with swing-top 
bottles, however. Unless you know someone
who drinks a lot of Grolsch (or similarly packaged
products) and wants to part with the empty 
bottles, the cost for two cases of these bottles
can be considerable. This type of bottle also
requires a little more attention at sanitation time.
You need to remove the rubber gasket and clean
the plastic (or ceramic) top thoroughly. Be aware
that the gaskets can wear out and occasionally
need to be replaced after repeated uses.
Finally, for those of you who want to send your
homebrew to competitions, stay away from bot-
tling your beer in swing-top bottles; these bottles
aren’t accepted at major competitions in the U.S.

Currently, The Carbonater is available only in the ball-lock style. Owners of
kegs with pin-lock fittings are out of luck, at least for the time being.
A couple of things to keep in mind when using The Carbonater: Carbonated
beer in a pressurized plastic bottle isn’t the ideal situation, nor should it 
be. Homebrew isn’t meant to be stored in soda bottles for long periods of
time. The Carbonater bottling method simply enables you to dispense and
transport smaller quantities of beer from your keg. And because you use The
Carbonater with plastic bottles, close attention to gas pressure is important;
40 psi is the maximum recommended pressure for standard plastic soda 
bottles.
One last caveat: Soda bottles — pressurized or not — are never accepted at
homebrew competitions.
The Carbonater also enables you to carbonate water or any other beverage 
in your home for a spritzy, refreshing drink.
Counterintelligence: Flowing from 
keg to bottle for competition
If you want to send samples of your kegged beer to far-flung homebrew 
competitions, you can bottle your kegged beer in one of two ways:
 Fill your bottles by using your kegging system’s beverage dispensing
hose.
 Fill your bottles by using a counterpressure bottle filler, hooked up to
your kegging system.
The first method is suspect because the beer not only loses carbonation
during the transfer but also risks picking up oxidation or contamination 
along the way. The second method is far more sound and proper for a 
competition-worthy beer.
A counterpressure bottle filler is an apparatus that first backfills the bottle 
with CO2, thus purging the bottle of air, and then maintains pressure 
within the bottle while the beer is flowing in through the filler tube. Counter-
pressure bottle filling eliminates both the loss of carbonation and the threat
of oxidation and contamination. A typical counterpressure bottle filler setup
includes a gas line, a beer line, a filler tube, and shutoff valves. Figure 13-2
shows how to use a counterpressure filler. For more detail, refer to package
directions.
143
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew

A Primer on Priming
As you may know, yeast is responsible for producing the natural carbonation
in beer and other fermentable beverages (see Chapter 6 for more on yeast
and fermentation). And, because carbon dioxide escapes from the fermenter,
you may be wondering how you can put the carbonation back into your beer.
The answer is a simple little trick called priming.
Priming means adding more fermentable sugar to the beer just prior to 
bottling it. The small number of yeast cells that remain in the solution when
you bottle your brew gladly see to it that they eat the sugars you add and
thus provide the desired carbonation within the bottle. Of course, this
process doesn’t happen overnight. You need to allow another one to two
weeks before your beer is properly carbonated and ready to drink.
Getting ready to prime
When you choose a priming sugar for beer, you need to consider two things:
the quantity and the fermentability of the priming ingredient you’re going to
use. The first factor is dependent on the second factor.

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

As I mention earlier, the idea of priming is to put more fermentable sugar 
into the beer so that the yeast can create the needed carbonation within the
bottle. But consider the consequences of giving the yeast too little or too
much sugar to eat: Too little priming sugar can result in an under-carbonated
beer, but too much sugar may cause your bottles to explode! Don’t panic — 
I discuss proper priming quantities in the “Deciding which and how much
primer to use” section in this chapter.
Two important points regarding beer priming: First, not all beer styles 
contain the same level of carbonation. A Berliner Weisse, for example, is far
more effervescent than, say, a Scotch Ale. At a competitive level, you may
want to take this discrepancy into consideration; otherwise, you may just
want to use the standard measure of priming sugar detailed in the next 
section. The second important point is that high-gravity beers you intend 
to condition in the bottle over longer periods of time are likely to build up
increasing carbonation levels as they age. If you plan on storing a particularly
big Barley Wine away for several months, you may want to cut back on the
amount of priming sugar you add at bottling time.
Another consideration for those who brew high-gravity beers and age them 
a long time: If your beer has been aging for a month or longer, what yeast is
left in it is probably old and fatigued. With your yeast’s declining viability 
in mind, you probably want to add some fresh yeast to the beer along with 
the priming agent at bottling time. Using generic dry yeast is perfectly
acceptable here.
Deciding which and how 
much primer to use
Different sugar sources (refined sugar, honey, molasses, and so on) have 
different levels of fermentability, which means that the more fermentable
sugar a priming mixture has, the less of the mixture you need. Conversely,
you need more of a priming mixture with less fermentable sugar. You can
potentially use any one of the adjunct sugars mentioned in Chapter 8 for
priming purposes. Note that because you use them in such small quantities,
priming sugars have virtually no effect on the beer’s taste.
To keep the priming process simple, I recommend using dextrose (corn
sugar). Dextrose is highly fermentable, widely available, easy to work with,
and inexpensive.
Regardless of what form of priming sugar you use to prime your beer, always
dissolve and dilute it in boiling water first, and allow the priming mixture to
cool before adding it to the beer. The amount of water used to boil the sugar
in is of little concern — 1 or 2 cups are typical.
145
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew

In the average 5-gallon batch of beer, 3⁄4 of a cup (not 3⁄4 of a pound!) of 
dextrose is the maximum recommended amount for priming. Using more
than this may result in exploding bottles but is more likely to result in over-
carbonated beer and gushers — bottles that act like miniature volcanoes
when your buddies pry the caps off. Hmmm, sounds like a good prank, 
come to think of it.
Exploring alternative primers
Although dextrose (corn sugar) is the cheapest and most convenient priming
agent available to homebrewers, you do have other options when you’re
ready to carbonate your beer. Read on. . .
Dry malt extract: The purists’ choice
Brewing purists may cringe at the thought of adding a refined white sugar 
to homebrew, so they often use a more-unadulterated alternative. Dry malt
extract, or DME, is a second choice for priming beer. But, as I point out in
Chapter 4, DME is only about 70 percent fermentable. Therefore, you need 
to use more DME than dextrose (which is about 99 percent fermentable). 
If you take the purists’ route, make sure you increase your priming volume 
to 1 1/4 cups of dry malt extract per 5-gallon batch of beer.
Not only do you need to use more DME than dextrose, but you also need to
allow more time for the carbonation within the bottle to build up. Yeast can
consume and convert the simple dextrose sugars into carbon dioxide much
more quickly than it can the more complex maltose sugars found in malt
extract.
Fruit liqueurs: The exotic choice
As a really progressive homebrewer, yet another priming ingredient exists
that not only carbonates your beer but also imbues it with various fruit 
flavors: fruit liqueurs. Most liqueurs are a great alternative priming agent for
the following reasons:
 Liqueurs contain a fair amount of sugar. One 750 milliliter bottle con-
tains just about enough sugar to prime a 5-gallon batch of beer. Because
the actual sugar content of any liqueur depends on the company that
made it (although it more likely has too little sugar than too much), you
may want to add another ounce or two of dextrose to be sure.
 Fruit liqueurs are available in a variety of flavors. My local liquor store
stocks cherry, blueberry, blackberry, peach, strawberry, raspberry,
orange, and even black currant liqueur.
 Fruit syrups used in liqueurs are usually of high quality. Fruit liqueurs
offer rich and consistent fruit flavor and aroma.
146
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

 Liqueurs are already antiseptic. Because they contain alcohol contents
of up to 40 percent, no further treatment is necessary before adding
them to your beer. (Don’t worry about the added alcohol; the total con-
tent in your beer isn’t likely to rise more than 1 or 2 percent, at most.)
Use only translucent liqueurs — never cream liqueurs. Cream liqueurs add an
unappealing milky haze to your beer (yech!).
Crowning Achievements
Although I typically refer to bottle caps, keep in mind that many brewers call
caps crowns. Caps or crowns — whatever you call them, they’re one of the
most useful but inexpensive tools available to you, the homebrewer.
By and large, a bottle cap is a bottle cap is a bottle cap. They’re plentiful,
inexpensive, come in a limited variety of colors, and are usually sold by the
batch (60 pieces — includes extras) or by the gross (144 pieces). Bottle caps
are metal on the outside with a plastic seal on the inside. That plastic gasket
is what makes one kind of bottle cap special (see the “Rare air” sidebar in
this chapter). You need to sanitize all bottle caps before using them. To do
so, simply boil them in water or soak them in your sanitizing agent of choice.
Because bottle caps are expendable (you use them once and then discard
them), such a one-time-use piece of equipment is actually more like an 
ingredient — you need to replenish it for each batch of beer you brew and
bottle. And because you may choose to bottle your beer in self-sealing,
swing-top bottles, you may have no need for bottle caps at all (you find more
on swing-top bottles in the “Swingtime” sidebar earlier in this chapter).
147
Chapter 13: Bottling Your Brew
For keggers only
If you intend to keg your beer, you may choose to
prime before you keg it or not to prime it at all.
The use of kegs and compressed carbon dioxide
gas cylinders allows you to carbonate beer with-
out the use of priming sugars (see Chapter 14 for
more about the kegging process).
If you choose to prime your kegged beer, you can
afford to be a little more relaxed about overprim-
ing than if you bottled your beer — kegs come
with pressure relief valves to vent excessive
pressure. No exploding kegs!

148
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Rare air
The SmartCap Pure Seal is a brand of bottle cap
that has an inner seal that actually absorbs
oxygen within the sealed bottle. These caps are
moisture-activated (which means you need to
store the caps in a humidity-free location). Unlike
all other plain bottle caps, you should never boil
or soak these special caps prior to using them.
These oxygen-absorbing caps are especially
important to homebrewers who create high-
gravity beers with long shelf-lives; the SmartCap
guards against the oxidation (absorption of
oxygen by the beer) that usually affects aging
beers. Instead of oxygen being absorbed by your
beer, it’s absorbed by the cap. These caps gen-
erally cost about 50 percent more than regular
caps, but considering the bottom line, they’re
worth it.
Shortly after the oxygen-absorbing caps were
introduced to the homebrewing market, skepti-
cal and inquisitive members of a homebrew club
staged an unscientific experiment using these
caps. They bottled a batch of hoppy pale Ale
using both the Pure Seal cap and regular bottle
caps. Labeled simply beer “A” and beer “B,”
other club members then evaluated the aroma
and taste of both beers and commented on 
their freshness levels. By a notable margin, club
members preferred the beer capped with the
newfangled crowns.

In This Chapter
 Cleaning your keg
 Kegging your beer
 Dispensing your brew
A
s I mention in Chapter 13, homebrewers seem to universally agree 
that bottling is the worst part of homebrewing. The cleaning, storing,
sanitizing, and capping of bottles is very tedious and time-consuming. If you
can’t stand bottling, kegging your brew is a viable option if you have a little
disposable income.
In this chapter, I give you some advice on how to make decisions that answer
the questions you face when you decide to keg your own beer: “What type of
keg do I need (and what equipment goes along with it)?”; “How do I sanitize 
it properly?”; and “How do I tap it like a pro?” (See Chapter 13 for information
about how to bottle your kegged beer when you want to transport small
amounts.)
Roll Out the Barrel: Buying 
Your Kegging Equipment
Buying kegging equipment isn’t easy; that’s why I’m here — to simplify your
decision. The system I recommend for homebrewers is a 5-gallon soda keg
system, because it’s easier to clean, fill, handle, and obtain than commercial
beer kegs. Using commercial beer kegs requires special tools and equipment,
and they’re almost impossible to clean properly without more expensive
equipment.
Any kegging system, even on the homebrewing level, is going to require
somewhat costly specialized equipment, such as a CO2 tank with regulators
and hoses. These items can take a bite out of your wallet even if you buy
them used. On the positive side, a CO2 setup is multifunctional; you can use 

it for filtering and force-carbonating your beer, among other things (see
Chapter 27 and the “Making bubbles: Carbonating procedures” section in 
this chapter).
Here’s what you need for the kegging procedures outlined in this chapter:
 One or more stainless steel soda kegs: A new keg can cost as much as
$100, although a used one may be as little as $25. Whatever route you
choose, be sure your kegs seal properly and hold pressure.
Soda keg fittings come in two types — ball or pin lock — and either 
type is acceptable. These names relate to the configuration of the valve
connection that allows pressurized gas to flow into (but not out of) the
valve until you depress it (kind of like the valve on a bicycle or car tire).
Pin lock configuration tends to be a bit more expensive.
 A pressurized carbon dioxide tank: This tank will run you $75 to $125,
and it costs another $15 to $20 each time you refill it.
 A carbon dioxide tank regulator (preferably a dual gauge): This item
isn’t cheap either — it sets you back $75 to $90.
Tank regulators are available in single gauge and dual gauge types. The
single gauge only tells you the pressure of the gas flowing through the
gas line; the dual gauge is better because it tells you the line pressure as
well as the gas pressure remaining in the tank.
 Appropriate quick-disconnect fittings (for ball or pin lock): Get one fit-
ting for the gas inflow and one for the liquid outflow. They’re reasonably
priced at $6 to $8 each.
 A carbon dioxide hose line (gas inflow line): It’s not a bad deal at about
$1 per foot.
 A beer dispenser line with a tap faucet (liquid outflow line): This is
another item with a fairly cheap price: $5 to $10.
 A sanitizing agent: I recommend Iodophor or another iodine-based 
sanitizer, which costs $2 to $10 depending on the container size.
Although ordinary household bleach is fine for sanitizing most other
homebrew equipment, stainless steel is an exception. Chlorine can 
actually eat away the surface of stainless steel at high concentrations 
or over an extended period of time, especially at low pH levels. If you
must use bleach out of desperation, use only 1 ounce per 5 gallons and
limit contact time with the keg to 30 minutes. Consider yourself warned.
 A screwdriver and adjustable wrench: You may have these items lying
around your house.
 A carboy brush or similar cleaning brush: Again, you may already have
an appropriate brush.
Figure 14-1 shows you what your soda keg system looks like when you’re all
set up and ready to keg.

Getting Your Keg Up and Flowing
After you’ve made your decisions and your purchases, the first thing you
want to do is thoroughly clean and sanitize your kegging equipment. I cover
the information on how to do this in the following section. When you have a
beer ready to keg, all you need to do is follow the easy directions I provide 
a bit later in this chapter.
Clean ’em out and fill ’em up: Sanitizing
and racking procedures
When it comes to storing your beer in kegs, the cleaning and sanitizing of
your equipment is important (just as it is with any other aspect of homebrew-
ing). Unlike bottles, however, kegs pose a slightly different problem: Because
kegs have many parts, it’s more difficult to make sure that all the parts are
equally clean and sanitized. This means you need to disassemble your keg in
preparation for the cleaning and sanitizing procedures. After you’ve properly
disinfected and reassembled it, filling it with your brew is a snap. The 
following steps walk you through sanitizing your keg.
1. After obtaining all the necessary system parts, hook up the regulator
to the CO2 cylinder.
Make sure you use the gasket that comes with the regulator. This gasket
must be in place between the regulator fitting and the CO2 tank to 
prevent gas leakage. (Too bad humans don’t come with gaskets.)

2. Vent any pressure from the keg by depressing the relief valve on top
of the keg.
If your keg doesn’t have a relief valve, you can depress the gas in valve
(at the top of the keg) with the tip of a screwdriver.
Always vent your keg of pressure before you open or disassemble it.
3. Open the large lid on top of the keg and clean the inside with water
and a carboy brush. Visually inspect the inside to make sure it’s clean.
If the keg is dirty or has beer or soda residue in it, you can clean it with
some trisodium phosphate (TSP) — never use ordinary household soap.
Rinse well with water. Remember that TSP is a cleanser, not a sanitizer.
4. If you own a used keg, you may want to replace the five gaskets to get
rid of the soda pop smell.
Alternatively, you can remove the gaskets and soak them in ethyl or
grain alcohol (be sure you rinse the alcohol away very thoroughly). See
Figure 14-2 for the locations of the gaskets you may need to clean or
replace. If it’s a new keg, proceed to Step 5; if you’re dealing with used
gaskets, the following checklist can help you find and clean them:

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

• The first gasket is easy to find — it’s around the lid. Remove it,
clean the lid thoroughly, and replace the gasket.
• Another two gaskets are around the outside of the tank plugs (the
in/out fittings). Carefully remove these gaskets and either clean or
replace them. Make sure to refit the plugs onto your keg.
• The last two gaskets are hidden on the dip tubes; you can find them
by using an adjustable wrench to loosen and remove the tank plugs
one at a time (don’t strip the plugs). Be careful not to lose any of
the small pieces (including the gaskets) inside the tank plugs.
Removing these plugs one at a time is important because the tank
plugs aren’t interchangeable — each is a different size and/or
shape. Be sure not to mix up the dip tubes (found under the tank
plugs) either. The fluid out tube is as long as the tank is deep, and
the gas in tube is about 1⁄2 inch long.
• Thoroughly clean the tank plugs (inside and out) of any soda pop
syrup or beer residue with a small brush and warm water (four out
of five brewers recommend using an old toothbrush).
• Remove the dip tubes by pushing them up from the inside with
your hands (don’t use pliers because they can damage the tubes).
• Now you can remove the two gaskets around the dip tubes and
clean or replace them.
• Clean the inside and outsides of the two dip tubes (don’t mix them
up). Reassemble the keg and apply 10 psi (pounds per square inch)
of carbon dioxide to see whether it still holds pressure. If the keg
doesn’t hold pressure, check to make sure you reassembled the
keg properly and tightened all the fittings.
You want to disassemble and clean the keg on a regularly scheduled
basis — every third brew or so.
5. After the keg is clean, fill it with 1 to 2 ounces of Iodophor sanitizer
(or according to the directions for the sanitizer of your choice) in 5
gallons of cool water to sanitize it.
Leave the sanitizer in the keg for at least 15 minutes.
Don’t forget to depress the out valve to allow Iodophor to flow up into
the long dip tube. You should also turn the keg upside down or on its
side for 15 minutes so that you sanitize the top, too.
6. After at least 15 minutes, drain the solution from the keg.
Pour some of the sanitizing solution in a bucket so that you can soak the
lid in it while you rinse and fill the keg.
7. Rinse the inside of the keg and drain all excess water.
Be sure you run some water through the out dip tube: Put the lid on 
the keg, apply CO2 pressure, and dispense the water as if you’re tapping
a beer.
153
Chapter 14: Kegging: Bottling’s Big Brother

If there is any question about the cleanliness of your water, I suggest pre-
boiling it before using it to rinse your kegs.
8. Rinse and replace the keg lid. Pressurize the keg to 10 psi and release
the CO2.
This step purges air from the keg.
9. Sanitize your siphon hose and siphon the finished beer into the keg
through its lid hole.
If you’re keeping track of your beer’s gravity and alcohol content, 
this is the time to take another hydrometer reading with your sanitized
hydrometer cylinder. (See Chapter 2 for more information on taking
hydrometer readings.)
10. Rinse the sanitized lid and then seal the keg.
Don’t forget to properly seat the gasket.
11. Apply 10 psi to the keg and vent.
Repeat this step five times to ensure that the atmosphere inside the keg
is almost pure CO2.
If the kegs aren’t kept under 5 to 10 pounds of pressure, the gaskets may
not seal completely. Be sure your keg is under pressure while you’re
storing beer in it.
Making bubbles: Carbonating procedures
Okay, so you’ve filled the keg. Now how do you carbonate it? This section
describes the method in minute detail.
Force carbonating is exactly what it sounds like — you’re forcing CO2 into the
beer by pressurizing the keg to a certain psi level (see Figure 14-3).
The advantage of force-carbonating is that the beer has little sediment 
(especially if you allowed the beer to age in a carboy for two to three weeks).
The beer is also ready to drink in a day or two. The following steps show you
how to force-carbonate your brew:
1. Chill your beer to 60 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler and take the 
precise temperature of the beer.
(Check out Chapter 27 for the lowdown on stick-on type thermometers.)
2. Next, hook up the CO2 line to the “CO2 in” plug on the keg.
3. Find the temperature of your beer at the left of the gas volume table in
Figure 14-3 and then follow the top row of the table to the right to find
the volumes of CO2 to which you want to carbonate your beer. Follow
the column that you choose down to the pressure (psi) indicated.
154
Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 

Check out the nearby “Pump up the volume” sidebar for more on volume.
4. Open the CO2 tank and set your regulator to the pressure you got from
the gas volume table.
5. Vent the keg and put the black disconnect onto the out valve of 
the keg.
If you hear gas bubbling through the beer, congratulations: You did this
step correctly.
6. Shake the keg to force the CO2 into the beer. Do this for 5 minutes, 
disconnect the CO2 from the keg, and then shut off the gas.
Repeat Steps 5 and 6 as often as you can over the next 24 hours or 
so. Make sure you always keep the temperature-to-pressure ratio the
same. If the temperature or the pressure changes, the amount of CO2
dissolved into the beer changes. When you can’t hear any gas going into
the solution, you know your beer is at the desired level of carbonation.
Always disconnect the gas line from the keg before you shut off the 
CO2 tank valve. Without pressure in the line, the beer may back up 
into the regulator. Remember that CO2 is a pressurized gas; observe all
necessary safety precautions. Consult your gas supplier for further
information.

for a couple of hours before dispensing.
The CO2 needs a few days to thoroughly dissolve into the beer, but your
brew is drinkable at this time.
Enjoying Your Brew: Tapping 
and Lapping Procedures
Here you go — your beer is kegged and ready to drink; all you need to do 
is grab your favorite beer glass and plop into your easy chair. Actually, you
have to hook up the keg and start the flow of CO2 first, but homebrew 
enjoyment doesn’t get much easier than this.
After the beer is carbonated:
1. Open the gas cylinder and set the regulator to 5 to 8 psi.
2. Vent the keg and hook up the gas and the dispense lines.
3. Tap and enjoy.
Always tap your beer with the tap head wide open (depress the valve com-
pletely). Opening the tap only halfway causes foaming. Also, if the beer still
foams too much (even when the tap head is wide open), turn the dispensing
pressure down a pound or two by adjusting the line pressure on the 
gas gauge.
When you’re done dispensing beer for the day, repressurize the keg to the
original carbonating pressure (if you force-carbonated) or to 10 psi (if you
primed it) to maintain the proper CO2 level in the beer.

Part III: Ready, Set, Brew! 
Pump up the volume
How much is a volume? Two volumes of CO2
are the equivalent of two 5-gallon containers’
worth of CO2 compressed into a single 5-gallon
container (the average beer has 2.4 to 2.7 
volumes of CO2).
How many volumes of CO2 do you need to put into
your beer? The answer depends greatly on the
particular beer style, but here are some general
guidelines to follow: British-style Ales = 1.75 to 2.5
volumes, American and European Lagers = 2.25
to 2.75 volumes, and highly carbonated beers
(Weizen, Fruit beers, and Belgian Ales) = 2.75 to
3.25 volumes. Clearly, force carbonating gives you
much more control over your beer’s carbonation
than simple priming techniques.

T
his is the fun part of the book — the part where you
get to put all your knowledge to work and try brewing
some real beer. The recipes in this part were hand-chosen
for their popularity, usability, and great taste. Note that
many of them are award winners from various AHA com-

recipes for you to sample. Have fun and enjoy!
Please note that several beer styles aren’t represented by
recipes in this book. This is due to the fact that reproduc-
ing these styles requires ingredients, equipment, and/or
procedures beyond the scope of this book.
Most beer styles are represented by recipes at two 
levels of difﬁculty: intermediate and advanced. Beginner
recipes, because they’re identical in procedure and only
vary by malt extract brand name, are limited to tips or
suggestions on how to mimic more difﬁcult procedures.
Also note:
 The number/letter designations next to each style
represent its place on the hierarchical listing on this

A
les, by traditional definition, are beers fermented with top-fermenting
yeast at warm temperatures for relatively short periods of time. Ales 
are primarily associated with England and Ireland, but you can find them in a
wide variety of styles in most brewing nations such as Australia, Belgium,
Canada, and the United States.
This chapter provides beer recipes for most of the beer styles that are Ale
varieties. Note: Not all of the Ale beer styles and substyles listed on the AHA
hierarchical list (on the Cheat Sheet) are included in this chapter. Because
certain beer styles are very difficult to produce at the homebrewing level
without highly advanced information, equipment, ingredients, and tech-
niques, I’ve omitted some of them from this chapter (trust me, this is for your
benefit!). Instead, I’ve placed my emphasis on popular beer styles. Also note
that, although I’ve compiled these recipes, I didn’t create all of them and
have little control over how much or how little information they provide. As a
general guideline, all water treatments in intermediate recipes are assumed
to be added to the brewpot unless otherwise noted; water treatments in
advanced recipes are assumed to be added to the mash water.

Extra Special/Strong Bitter 
(E.S.B.) (8-c)
The history of this style of beer is rather hazy because it probably developed
over a long period of time and was influenced by a number of factors. To
begin with, the pale malt needed to brew Pale Ale was developed only as
recently as the 1700s — most of the barley malt used prior to this time was a
brown malt (because of the kilning procedures) that resulted in darker beers.
Secondly, hop character is very important to the English-style Pale Ale that
drinkers recognize today, but hops were not in widespread use in England
until the mid-16th century. Furthermore, the English people made a clear dis-
tinction between unhopped Ale and any beer made with hops; these beers
were called bitters.
Think of strong bitters as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (tradition-
ally the brewer’s finest product). In England today, ESB is a brand unique to
Fullers; Americans have co-opted the name to describe a malty, bitter, red-
dish, standard-strength English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combi-
nation of English and American.
The parameters of the style are fairly loose, allowing for a generous range of
color and a fair fluctuation in gravities. Two things are certain about Pale
Ales: They exhibit fruity esters in the nose and a big hop presence in both the
flavor and the aroma. In fact, hops are the key to developing a good Pale Ale.
The Classic English Pale Ale should use a hop from England known as Kent
Goldings, but other aromatic varieties are perfectly acceptable. Pale Ales are
often dry-hopped, which is a method of imbuing the beer with a fresh hop
aroma (without the bitterness) by adding hops directly to the beer while it’s
in the aging tank or barrel instead of during the boiling process. See Chapters
5 and 11 for more information on dry hopping.
Flavor profile: Golden to deep amber. Lots of fruity esters can be expected.
High hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma dominate low to medium maltiness.
Toastiness and low levels of diacetyl are okay. Medium bodied.

Irish Red Ale (9-d)
Traditional Irish Ales are easy-drinking, but full-flavored, malt-accented
brews. One of the first Irish brands to hit the American market was George
Killian Lett’s Irish Ale. Unfortunately, when the Coors Brewing Company
bought the label and began to produce it in the United States, it lost most of
its original character — in fact, it isn’t even brewed as an Ale anymore. Due
to its popularity, though, numerous Red beers are produced throughout the
U.S. in an effort to capitalize on the success of Killian’s.
Flavor profile: Irish Red Ales are amber to deep copper/red in color (thus
their name). This style’s caramel malt flavor and sweetness sometimes has a
buttered-toast or toffee quality. Irish Ales often exhibit a light taste of roasted
malt, which lends a characteristic dryness to the finish. And not a shamrock
in sight. . . .

Strong Scotch Ale (9-e)
Strong Scotch Ale is — surprise! — the Scottish equivalent of English Old Ale.
The main differences are that Strong Scotch Ales are less aggressively hopped,
which contributes to this rounder, maltier character. Low levels of carbona-
tion are also an important characteristic of the style and help maintain a cer-
tain softness on the palate.
Strong Scotch Ale (or Scots Ale) is known as a wee heavy and, like most
Scottish Ales, is categorized by a Shilling designation, which corresponds to
the higher gravities of these Ales. Strong Scotch Ales usually start at around
90 Shilling and can go as high as 120 Shilling. Scotch ales are ordered by their
Shilling designation in Highland pubs.
Strong Scotch Ales share the same flavor characteristics as lighter Scottish
Ales but to an exaggerated degree. Strong Scotch Ales are typically over-
whelmingly malty — almost to the point of being cloyingly sweet — and the
low hopping rates do little to cut the intense maltiness. Regrettably, the lack of
protective hop resins in this beer style also tends to diminish its shelf life,
leaving only the alcohol to fend off the inevitable stale off flavors. Strong
Scotch Ale is often roused during the fermentation process to keep the yeast
active. This practice results in relatively low final gravities and alcohol poten-
tials as high as 8 percent by volume. The use of peat-smoked malt is one of the
traits of the finest Scotch whiskies, one that’s often shared between Strong
Scotch Ale and Scotch whisky.
Flavor profile: Deep copper to dark brown. Hop flavor and aroma are very
low. Overwhelmingly malty, but clean alcohol flavor balances the malt charac-
ter. Hop bitterness is low, and diacetyl is medium to high. Full-bodied. Faint
smoky character is okay.

Beginner suggestions
Strong Scotch Ales require a fair amount of fermentable material — try starting with at
least 7 pounds of extract. You don’t age Strong Scotch Ales as long as English Old Ales,
and they’re much maltier. Try progressing to a liquid yeast culture that’s not as attenuate
(doesn’t eat as much of the malt sugar) as dry yeasts. Try adding a small dose of liquid
smoke extract (1 to 2 teaspoons) to emulate the smokiness of the style.

American Pale Ale (10-a)
Americans have been brewing Ale since the first wave of colonists reached the
shores of the New World in the 1600s. Despite the onslaught of Lager-brewing
in the mid-1800s and the subsequent dominance of this country’s beer market
by bottom-fermenting breweries, American-Ale brewing has persevered. With
the recent upsurge in small-batch brewing, American Ales are now leading the
microbrewing renaissance.
American-style Ale is characterized by a copper color and medium maltiness.
It’s lighter in color and body compared to its English counterpart, but
American Pale Ales are rather aggressively bittered with American-grown hop
varieties from the Pacific Northwest.
Flavor profile: Pale to deep amber to copper. These beers offer medium hop
flavor and aroma and are fruity and estery. Expect low to medium maltiness
and high hop bitterness, with a bit of diacetyl and low caramel flavor. Medium-
bodied.

American Amber Ale (10-b)
Amber-colored Ales are similar to Pale Ales in terms of the brewing process;
their basic difference is in their colors. The grains you use to impart the
deeper hue in Amber Ales tend to give the beer a toasty character and a more
complex malt palate. Amber Ales are most often malt-accented, but they can
also have an aggressive hop character.
Flavor profile: Similar to American Pale Ale, but because of the addition of
toasted grain or dark crystal malts, the amber ales are likely to be slightly
darker and have a more pronounced toasty and malty aroma and flavor.
Noticeable to assertive hop flavor and aroma aren’t unusual. Medium-bodied.

American Brown Ale (10-c)
As Americans are often inclined to do, American brewers have taken a foreign
beer style and adapted it to local tastes. The American rendition of Brown Ale
maintains similar color and gravity profiles but is dry rather than sweet and
has far more hop character in the aroma and flavor.
Flavor profile: Medium to dark brown. Unlike English Brown Ales, American
Browns have a relatively high degree of hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.
Medium maltiness with chocolate accents along with caramel and nutty
flavors and low diacetyl. Medium-bodied.

Northern English Brown Ale (11-c)
Brown Ale is a close relative to Pale Ale. Aside from the obvious color differ-
ence, Brown Ales are also slightly maltier than the Pale Ales. Brown Ales are
also less aggressively hopped because the water you use for brewing tradi-
tional Brown Ale is chalky, and this hardness in the water tends to accentuate
the hop’s bitter qualities.
Brown Ales are relatively low-gravity beers that yield low alcohol content
after quick fermentations. You use chocolate malt to impart the brown color
and chocolatey palate. Some brewers add small quantities of molasses or
brown sugar to lend other flavor and aroma nuances to the beer. The nose
may also hint of fruit, nuts, and toffeelike aromas.
Flavor profile: Deep copper to brown. Hop flavor and aroma are low, with
fruity esters lingering behind. Sweet and malty with hints of chocolate; low
bitterness and diacetyl. Medium-bodied.

Brown Porter (12-a)
The Porter name is borrowed from a group of people known to consume large
quantities of this beer: the porters at London’s Victoria Station. Originally, it
didn’t exist as a single style. The porters had a habit of ordering portions of
several beers mixed into the same drinking glass. This concoction came to be
known as entire. One enterprising brewer capitalized on this habit by market-
ing a beer that closely approximated this blend of brews, and he used the
name Porter to identify it.
The brown malt used to make Porter beer was kilned over a wood fire, which
gave the malt, as well as the resulting beer, a distinctive smoky flavor and
aroma. Although Porters are no longer brewed with wood-kilned malts,
today’s Porters may still suggest a hint of smokiness in the nose or on the
palate. Today, two basic styles of Porter are available: Brown and Robust
(covered in the next section). Generally speaking, American microbrewers
favor the Robust style of Porter, although the Brown Porter remains the forte
of the British brewers.
Brown Porter is a meeker version of its big brother. Body and color are lighter,
though still maintaining a minimized dark-grain flavor and hue. Both the malty
sweetness and hop bitterness are downplayed, which lowers the resulting
alcohol to between 4 and 6 percent and makes this brew a little closer to a ses-
sion beer (a beer conducive to consumption in large volumes).

Robust Porter (12-b)
Robust Porter is a cousin of Stout. This beer is very dark — typically opaque.
It often takes on a reddish appearance in the presence of light. Dark-grain
aromas dominate the nose. Robust Porter is medium- to full-bodied with an
alcohol content that ranges between 5 and 7 percent. The most noticeable
characteristic is the dark-grain flavors derived from the chocolate malt and/or
black malts in the grist. Hop bitterness combined with mild grain astringency
balance the sweetness of the crystal malt. (Check out the previous section on
Brown Porter for more on Porter beer.)
Flavor profile: Opaque black. Fruity esters are okay. Hop flavor and aroma are
nonexistent to medium. No roast barley character — just the sharp bitterness
of black malt with a hint of burnt charcoal-like flavor. Medium to full bodied
and malty sweet with low diacetyl in the background. Hop bitterness is
medium to high.

Baltic Porter (12-c)
English-style Porter was traditionally brewed in countries bordering the Baltic
Sea, but that style was greatly influenced by Russian Imperial Stouts. Thus, a
Baltic Porter may also be referred to as an Imperial Porter.
A Baltic Porter often has the malt flavors reminiscent of an English Brown
Porter and the restrained roast of a Schwarzbier with a higher OG and alcohol
content than either. It’s a very complex beer with multilayered flavors. Silky
smoothness in the mouthfeel is a hallmark of the style.
Flavor profile: Baltic Porter offers a rich, malty sweetness with a complex
blend of deep malt, dried fruit esters, alcohol, and a prominent yet smooth
roasted flavor that stops short of burnt. It’s mouth-filling and very smooth; it
starts sweet, but darker malt flavors quickly dominate and persist through
finish. The malt character can have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses, and/or
licorice complexity, and you may taste a hint of roast coffee or licorice in the
finish. Medium-low to medium bitterness from malt and hops just to provide
balance.

Beginner suggestions
In order to achieve the minimum OG, you’d need to start with at least 8 pounds of dark
malt extract. Try producing the color and flavor in your porter by using specialty grains
(dark caramel, chocolate malt, black malt, roasted barley) rather than buying a dark malt
extract — the result is more satisfying. Toss an inch of brewer’s licorice or a couple of
ounces of blackstrap molasses into the brewpot for added complexity.

Dry Stout (13-a)
Stout is a hearty, top-fermented beer strongly associated with the British Isles
and Ireland; it’s known for its opaque-black appearance and roasty flavors.
The world of homebrew now boasts six different styles of Stout.
The term Stout, as it applies to beer, was first attached to the Porter style. A
bigger-bodied, more-robust Porter was aptly described as being a Stout
Porter. Exactly when a clear distinction was made between Stout Porters and
the separate Stout style that brewers recognize today is uncertain. Stout
appears to have come into its own in the early 1800s, following the invention
of a device for roasting barley and creating black malts — two of the hallmark
ingredients for making Stout.
Guinness Stout is probably the standard-bearer for the Stout style throughout
the world, but it’s more correctly known as a Classic Dry Stout, or Irish-style
Stout. The Classic Irish-style Dry Stout is the lightest and driest of the Stout
styles, as well as the least alcoholic. The Classic Irish-style Dry Stout is
defined by the roastiness of the unmalted roasted barley and the charred
flavor of the black malt in the recipe.
Flavor profile: Opaque black. No hop flavor or aroma. Roasted barley charac-
ter is expected. Slight malt sweetness or a caramel malt character is okay.
Medium to high hop bitterness with a slight acidity or sourness is possible. A
very low diacetyl level is okay. Medium bodied.

Sweet Stout (13-b)
Sweet Stout (alternatively known as London-style or Cream Stout) is the
English counterpoint to the Classic Irish-style Dry Stout. Although you find
many similarities between the two, the principal difference is how you
achieve their roasted character. The Classic Irish-style Dry Stout is defined
by the roastiness of the unmalted roasted barley and black malt, although the
London-style Sweet Stout often uses chocolate malt in its place. With regards
to the obvious contrast between these Stouts’ sweet and dry character, the
Sweet Stout has a creamier texture, a slightly higher gravity, and sweetness
across the palate resulting from the use of milk sugar (lactose), which beer
yeast can’t ferment. In rare instances, this style is also referred to as Milk
Stout.
Flavor profile: Opaque black. No hop flavor or aroma. Sweet maltiness and
caramel flavors are evident, and the roasted barley character is mild. Hop bit-
terness is low. Low diacetyl is okay. Medium- to full-bodied.

Foreign-Style Stout (13-d)
After the Classic Irish-style Dry Stout, the next most popular Stout style in the
world is the somewhat xenophobically named Foreign-Style Stout. This style is
more or less a free-form style of Stout that doesn’t necessarily fit into the
Classic Irish-style Dry or London-style Sweet Stout categories discussed in
the previous sections.

flavor expected. A slight malt sweetness is okay, as is a slight acidity or sour-
ness. Very low diacetyl is acceptable. Medium- to full-bodied.

Imperial Stout (13-f)
Another Stout style, rarer than most, is strongly associated with pre-Bolshevik
Russia. British brewers found favor among the Czarist rulers of Russia, particu-
larly for their brand of Stout. Unfortunately, the English-made Stout didn’t
travel well to St. Petersburg and other points east. To compensate for the short
shelf life of their beer, the British brewers did as they’d done for the India Pale
Ale being shipped to Bombay and Calcutta: raise the gravity and increase the
hop content. (Because these Ales were designed to condition on the high seas,
couldn’t the same be done for Stout?) Sure enough, the Russian rulers deeply
admired this complex high-alcohol brew. The style has since come to be known
as Russian Stout, Imperial Stout, or the combined Russian Imperial Stout.
Flavor profile: Dark copper to very black. High level of fruity esters. Hop bit-
terness flavor and aroma medium to high. Rich and complex maltiness with a
chewy texture; roasty, fruity, and bittersweet. Full-bodied with evident alco-
hol strength.

Imperial Stouts need a lot of fermentable material as well as a lot of dark grain complexity.
Start with at least 9 pounds of extract, and try achieving the color and character of this
style by using specialty grains (dark crystal malt, chocolate malt, black malt, and roasted
barley). Brewer’s licorice and unsulfured dark molasses can also add fermentable sugars
and complexity.

English India Pale Ale 
(IPA) (14-a)
One particular substyle of English-style Pale Ale is known as India Pale Ale, or
IPA for short. The beer gets its name from Britain’s colonial presence in India
during the 1800s. British royal subjects living in India demanded to have their
favorite Ales shipped to them at their outposts, but the month-long journey
on the open sea proved devastating to the average cask of beer. A British
brewer named Hodgson recognized this problem and decided to brew an Ale
of greater strength to withstand the rigors of oceanic transit. The antiseptic
properties of the increased alcohol volume, coupled with a high concentra-
tion of hop acids, assured the colonialists of a palatable product at journey’s
end. They also realized a surprising dividend on receipt of the beer: The
gentle rocking motion of the ship on the waters caused the beer within the
casks to pick up some of the oaky character, much like barrel-aged wine.
Some brewers today maintain that link with the past by employing oak bar-
rels for the aging process. Some believe that the IPA style was actually
defined before the Pale Ale style itself!
Flavor profile: Golden to light copper. Very fruity and estery. Medium malti-
ness with high hop bitterness and low diacetyl. Hop flavor and aroma are
medium to high. Alcoholic strength is often evident. Medium-bodied.

Part IV: Homebrew Recipes 
Beginner suggestions
IPAs are essentially higher-gravity Pale Ales with higher hopping ratios. Follow the recom-
mendations given for Classic English Pale Ale but add another pound of extract and, at the
20-minute and 5-minute marks in the boil, increase the hop quantities to full ounces rather
than half-ounces. Some brewers emulate the style by imbuing their IPAs with a woody
flavor — try steeping 6 ounces of oak chips in the wort in the last 15 minutes of the boil.
When you’re comfortable with the idea, consider dry-hopping your IPA by tossing an ounce
of English hops into your secondary fermenter.

American India Pale 
Ale (IPA) (14-b)
American craft brewers — and American craft-beer drinkers — have fully
embraced the IPA style to the point where they have virtually made it their
own. The motto for these IPA devotees seems to be hops, hops, and more
hops — American hops, of course! (See the previous section for more about
the IPA style.)
Flavor profile: Golden to deep amber. Very fruity and estery. Medium malti-
ness with high hop bitterness and low diacetyl. Hop flavor and aroma are
medium to high, accentuating the fruity, citrusy, and piney qualities of
American hops. Alcoholic strength is often evident. Medium-bodied.

Imperial India Pale 
Ale (IPA) (14-c)
Taking IPA to a whole ’nother level, this recent American innovation reflects
the trend of American craft brewers pushing the envelope to satisfy the need
of hop aficionados for increasingly intense products. Imperial IPAs are obvi-
ously bigger than a standard IPA in both alcohol strength and overall hop
level (bittering and finish), though they don’t quite approach the level of
Barley Wine. They’re definitely a showcase for hops, however.
The adjective Imperial is arbitrary and simply implies a stronger version of
an IPA, calling to mind the Russian imperial version of Stout.
Flavor profile: Golden amber to reddish copper; dry-hopped versions may
be a bit hazy. Very fruity and estery. Medium maltiness with high hop bitter-
ness and low diacetyl. Biscuity and toasty malt flavors may be experienced.
Hop flavor and aroma are medium to high, accentuating the fruity, citrusy,
and piney qualities of American hops. Alcoholic strength is often evident.
Medium-bodied.

Part IV: Homebrew Recipes 
Beginner suggestions
Imperial IPAs are essentially very high-gravity India Pale Ales with huge hopping ratios and
corresponding alcohol levels. Follow the recommendations given for American IPA but add
another pound or two of extract and increase the hop quantities by at least a third. If you
don’t dry hop your IPA with at least 2 ounces of American hops, it’ll fall short of the imper-
ial expectation. All of the increased malt, hops, and alcohol benefit from additional aging;
I suggest adding another week or so to the secondary fermentation.

White (Wit)(16-a)
This Belgian style of beer is now quite popular in the United States. (The U.S. is
one of the few countries that brew White beer, or Witbier, outside of Belgium.)
Belgium is a linguistically divided nation, a situation that can cause additional
misunderstanding of this style of beer. In the French-speaking provinces,
people call this brew Biere Blanche, and in the Flemish-speaking regions, the
same beer is known as Witbier. Both names refer to the white appearance of
the beer. It’s not actually white, but it’s very pale yellow and often cloudy with
sediment, which helps create its white cast. Both the paleness and the cloudi-
ness can be partly attributed to the high percentage (45 percent) of unmalted
wheat that goes into the beer. The balance of the grist is pale barley malt.
This style comes from the Brabant town of Hoegaarden, which is known for its
wheat-based beers. What sets Witbier apart from the other Wheat Beers of the
region is the inclusion of unconventional beer ingredients, such as the rind of
the bitter Curaçao orange, the lemony coriander seed, and another secret
spice believed to be Grain of Paradise (also known as alligator seed). The beer
is generally hopped with the English Kent hop. After a relatively short and
cool fermentation, the beer gets another dose of yeast before being bottled for
additional conditioning.
Flavor profile: Hazy pale yellow. Hop flavor and aroma are desirable, but bit-
terness should be only low to medium. Low to medium fruity esters are typi-
cal. Low to medium body. Mild, sweet malt and spicy character early, finishing
on the dry side. Low diacetyl levels are okay.

Part IV: Homebrew Recipes 
Beginner suggestions
Starting with a base of the palest malt extract you can find, you can easily emulate
Witbier’s most identifiable flavor character by adding dried orange peel and crushed
coriander to the boiling wort. Using wheat malt and this style’s specific yeast strain are
your next most important moves.

Belgian Pale Ale (16-b)
This group of beers is somewhat indistinct. Belgian brewers produce a stag-
gering variety of top-fermented beers, and not all of them fit neatly into spe-
cialized categories. The Belgian Pale Ale category serves as a catchall for low-
to medium-gravity Ales that don’t match any other preexisting Belgian styles.
Flavor profile: Golden to deep amber. Hop character is subdued, and so is
the malt. Light- to medium-bodied. Mild fruity esters and flavors and a bit of a
caramel or roasted malt flavor should be noticeable. A slight acidity may be
experienced but no diacetyl.

Dubbel (18-b)
The word Trappist, which often precedes the name of this Belgian Dubbel,
doesn’t so much denote a type of beer as it does a type of brewery. A Trappist
beer is brewed at one of only six Trappist abbey breweries that exist in
Europe (five in Belgium and one in the Netherlands). Any secular brewer who
markets an imitation of one of these breweries’ products must use the term
abbey beer.
Although the beers made by these Cistercian monks vary in style, they all fea-
ture high gravities, warm fermentations, top fermenting yeasts, and bottle-
conditioning. Some of these monastic brewers add candi sugar to the brew
during the boiling process, resulting in rather high-octane libations. The high
fermentation temperatures produce a full range of fruity and estery aromas
and flavors.
Some abbeys produce Ales in three graduated strengths. The mild Single is
just for the monks’ personal consumption; the dark Dubbel is a stronger ver-
sion of the Single; and the golden Tripel is the most potent (which leads me to
wonder what a Home Run would taste like).
Because much of the Trappist beers’ characters are a result of the yeast, brew-
ers must obtain these strains to replicate the style correctly.
Flavor profile: Dark amber to brown. The aroma is a combination of sweet,
malty, and nutty, with low levels of fruity esters in the background. Medium- to
full-bodied, with mild bitterness and very low diacetyl.

Tripel (18-c)
The word Trappist, which often precedes the name of this Belgian Tripel, 
doesn’t so much denote a type of beer as it does a type of brewery. A Trappist
beer is brewed at one of only six Trappist Abbey breweries that exist in Europe
(five in Belgium and one in the Netherlands). Any secular brewer who markets
an imitation of one of these breweries’ products must use the term Abbey
beer.
Although the beers made by these Cistercian monks vary in style, they all fea-

during the boiling process, resulting in rather high-octane libations. The high
fermentation temperatures produce a full range of fruity and estery aromas
and flavors.
Some abbeys produce Ales in three graduated strengths. The mild Single is
just for the monks’ personal consumption; the dark Dubbel is a stronger ver-
sion of the single; and the golden Tripel is the most potent. The elusive
Quadrupel is the rarest of them all — so rare that this is the only mention of
this style in this book.
Because much of the Trappist beers’ characters are a result of the yeast, brew-
ers must obtain these strains to replicate the style correctly.
Flavor profile: Light, pale gold. Light malty and hoppy aroma. Banana esters

Old Ale (19-a)
English Strong Ale was the standard drinking-man’s beer in the 1600s and
1700s. Lack of refrigeration and clean storage conditions called for a beer of
considerable gravity and strength to prevail against bacterial contamination.
Because these beers were particularly robust, high hopping rates were neces-
sary to offset the cloying nature of the malt. The resulting beer had natural
hop-preservative resins and a high alcohol content to stave off any contami-
nation that was likely to occur during the long aging process. This extended
aging period is the reason these brews are called Old Ales.
Old Ales are full-bodied brews with a nutty, grainy malt character balanced
by a fair amount of hop bitterness. Vigorous fermentations give the beer a
noticeable fruity, estery nose resulting in a robust, complex, and slightly
vinous (winelike) beer overall.
Flavor profile: Light to deep amber. Fruitiness and esters are high; hop flavor
and aroma can be assertive. Medium- to full-bodied. Very malty, with a fair
amount of diacetyl evident. Alcoholic strength is noticeable.

Beginner suggestions
Old Ales require a fair amount of fermentable material in the recipe — try starting with 7
pounds of amber extract. Long, warm fermentations produce an abundance of fruity and
alcoholic aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. Two to three ounces of English bittering hops are
necessary to maintain flavor balance.

The term Barley Wine sounds more like something you make from grapes,
and yet its name mentions a grain. What’s up with that? Well, the name
implies a beverage made from barley but that has the strength and character
of wine; you soon see that the name is apropos.
Barley Wine is a classic English style of old Ale. With its huge body, almost-
overwhelming malty flavor, and the kick of a mule, Barley Wine isn’t for the
weak-kneed. These complex and alcoholic brews pack a one-two punch of
flavor and strength because of the high level of fermentable sugars, or gravity.
Barley Wine has more than twice the strength of a European Pilsener. The
resulting alcohol content is around 8.5 to 12 percent by volume. Needless to
say, these potent potables aren’t intended for summer consumption. In fact,
brewers usually produce Barley Wine in limited quantities, often earmarked
for holiday celebrations. And because of its alcoholic strength and high ter-
minal gravities, you can store Barley Wine for future consumption.
The color range for Barley Wine is forgiving, usually starting out around
copper and working its way into the deep ambers. The nose is pungent — an
olfactory cornucopia of fruits and malt aromas, ethanol, and hop bouquet.
Correctly balancing the bold, malty character of this style requires copious
amounts of hop bittering, further intimidating the novice beer drinker. The
finish is always long, complex, and warming in the throat.
Flavor profile: Copper to medium brown and medium to full-bodied. Barley
Wines are usually malty sweet, fruity, and estery, with medium to high bitter-
ness levels. Hop aroma and taste can be anywhere from low to high. Expect
to taste the alcohol. Low to medium diacetyl is acceptable.

Beginner suggestions
Successful Barley Wines are big and bold beers. Use at least 9 pounds of extract to achieve
the correct body and strength. Remember to aerate the wort sufficiently before pitching
the yeast and to pitch enough healthy yeast to ferment the beer completely. Full fermenta-
tion should take at least three weeks.

L
agers are beers fermented with bottom-fermenting yeast at cool 
temperatures for relatively long periods of time. They’re primarily 
associated with northern and eastern European countries such as Germany,
Denmark, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia but are produced in a wide
variety of styles in most brewing nations, including France, Belgium, the U.K.,
Ireland, Russia, the Nordic and Baltic countries, China, Japan, other Asian
nations, Australia, New Zealand, most South American countries, Canada,
Mexico, and the United States. Whew!
This chapter provides beer recipes for most of the beer styles considered
Lager varieties. Note: Not all of the Lager beer styles and substyles listed 
on the AHA hierarchical list (on the Cheat Sheet) are discussed in this 
chapter. Because some beer styles are hard to produce at the homebrewing
level without highly advanced ingredients, equipment, information, and 
techniques, I decided to spare you from them. Also note that, although I’ve
compiled all of these recipes, I didn’t author all of them and have little 
control over how much or how little information they provide. As a general
guideline, all water treatments in intermediate recipes are assumed to be
added to the brewpot unless otherwise noted; water treatments in advanced
recipes are assumed to be added to the mash water.

American Premium Lager (1-c)
The pale American-style Premium Lager represents the most-produced beer
style in the United States, as well as in other countries such as Australia,
Canada, Japan, and Mexico that have followed in the footsteps of the
American industrial brewers.
American-style Premium Lagers, despite their categorical name, are still
rather one-dimensional beers compared to those made in Europe and else-
where. The reasons for this condition are largely the cheaper ingredients
used to make them and the treatment of beer in America as a beverage
designed for mass consumption. American craft brewers, on the other hand,
are producing Premium Lagers that are more deserving of the name.
Flavor profile: Very pale to golden. No fruitiness, esters, or diacetyl. Low
malt aroma and flavor are okay. Low hop flavor or aroma is okay, but low to
medium bitterness is expected. Effervescent. Light-bodied.

Münchner-Style Helles (1-d)
German Light Lagers aren’t low-calorie beers; they’re just pale-colored. The
original pale Lager beer was brewed in Munich in 1928. In that year, the
famous Paulaner Brewery introduced a Helles (pale) Lager, which was there-
fore known as Münchner-style Helles. This style is meant to be an everyday
libation, and it’s quaffed by the liter throughout Bavaria.
Münchner-style Helles, sometimes called Continental Lager, is pale yellow to
brilliant gold in color and light- to medium-bodied. The accent is on the malti-
ness, with just enough hop bitterness extracted from noble hop varieties to
balance the malt. The downplayed hop character is the principal difference
between pale Lager and Pilsener and one to look out for in buying American
microbrews.
Flavor profile: Pale to golden. No fruitiness or esters; hop flavor and aroma
are okay. Medium malty sweetness. Low bitterness and no diacetyl are
expected. Medium-bodied.

Dortmunder/European-
Style Export (1-e)
Dortmunder beer gets its name from the city of Dortmund, which is one of
the most prolific beer brewing cities in the world. Although the Dortmunder
style of Lager beer is very popular in central Germany, it’s not very well known
elsewhere, which may explain its large blue-collar customer base of miners
and steelworkers. Additionally, Dortmunder beer gets kind of lost between
the world-famous Pilsener beers and the revered pale Lagers from Munich.
Typically, Dortmunder beer is fuller-bodied than Pilsener, somewhat dry com-
pared to a Münchner-Style Helles, and slightly higher in alcohol than both.
The European-style Export tag was attached to this style after a few of
Dortmunder’s larger brewers began exporting their local beers to the interna-
tional market.
Flavor profile: Pale to golden. No fruitiness, esters, or diacetyl are acceptable.
Very low hop flavor and aroma are okay. Medium bitterness balances medium
malty sweetness. Alcohol warmth is sometimes evident. Medium body.

Bohemian-Style Pilsener (2-b)
Pilsener beer developed in Plzen, Bohemia, in the mid-1800s. Today, Pilsener
is the world’s most popular style of beer and, more than any other, is what
most Americans think of if the subject turns to beer. Small wonder. Most major
breweries in the world produce something akin to this style. Unfortunately,
most pay little tribute to the original.
The original brand of Pilsener beer — still the standard-bearer in the
industry — hails from the town of Plzen, which is now part of the Czech
Republic. The name of that brand — Pilsner Urquell — even makes note of the
fact that it’s the original; Urquell means “original source.” The Pilsener name
(in all its many forms: Pils, Pilsner, Pilsener, Plzensky) derives from this
Bohemian town, where the brewery was built in 1842. The golden-colored,
bottom-fermented beer brewed there quickly became popular in Europe and,
eventually, throughout the world.
The style is pale, malty, and well-hopped. The aroma has the unmistakable
kiss of the Saaz hop from the Zatec region near Plzen. Caramel notes are
often observed, as is a hint of diacetyl rounding out the sweetness and
mouthfeel. One key ingredient in a real Pilsener beer is the extremely soft
water, similar to that pumped from the aquifers under the Urquell Brewery.
Flavor profile: Pale to golden. No fruitiness or esters; low to medium hop
flavor and aroma are expected. Low to medium maltiness is evident in aroma
and flavor, with caramel notes in background. Medium to high bitterness with
low diacetyl is okay. Light- to medium-bodied.

Märzen/Oktoberfest (3-b)
Märzen, Oktoberfest, and Vienna beers are pretty much of the same
pedigree — they’re all bottom-fermented, malty, and medium- to full-bodied.
Oktoberfest beer, as an individual style, is an offshoot of another, larger Lager
style known as Märzen or Märzenbier. This fairly heavy, malty style of beer is
brewed in the spring and named for the month of March (März). It was often
the last batch of beer brewed before the warm summer months, during
which brewing was ill-advised (back before the invention of refrigeration, of
course). This higher-gravity beer was then stored in Alpine caves and con-
sumed throughout the summer. Whatever beer was left in storage at harvest
time, also the beginning of the new brewing season, was hauled out and joy-
ously consumed.
A party atmosphere was already present in the Oktoberfest celebration, but it
took on a more reverent slant in 1810. In late September of that year,
Bavaria’s Crown Prince married Theresa Von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. This
very public event just happened to coincide with the rollout of the excess
Märzenbier. The good people of Munich so enjoyed the state celebration that
they agreed to commemorate the nuptial feast and its pageantry on an annual
basis. The breweries of Munich were certainly not against the idea — more
than a million people attend the event every year, which takes place on the
Theresienwiese (Theresa’s meadow), named for the royal bride.
Today, Munich’s Oktoberfest begins on a Saturday in mid-September with
the Lord Mayor’s proclamation “O’zapft is!” (“It’s tapped!”) as he taps the cer-
emonial first keg of beer. The festival then lasts 16 days and ends on the first
Sunday in October.
Flavor profile: Amber to coppery orange. No fruitiness, esters, or diacetyl
are evident. Low hop flavor and aroma are okay. The malty sweetness boasts
of a toasty malt aroma and flavor. Low to medium bitterness is just enough to
keep the malty character from becoming cloying. Medium-bodied.

American Dark Lager (4-a)
The production of American Dark Lagers was in steep decline for most of the
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The relatively newer, lighter-bodied pale Lager beers
had become the national standard in beer drinking, and dark beers in general
fell out of favor among American beer drinkers. Thus, the few dark lagers still
being made became dark in color more than in style or substance. The addi-
tion of very small percentages of highly kilned malts enabled brewers to
achieve a maximum of beer color with a minimum effect on beer taste. In
other words, the beer looked dark (in relative comparison to pale Lager) but
didn’t taste dark.
Flavor profile: Deep copper to dark brown. No fruitiness or esters. Low hop
flavor or aroma is okay; so is low bitterness. Low malt aroma or flavor is
okay. Very low diacetyl is okay — really, it is! Effervescent. Light- to medium-
bodied.

Munich Dunkel (4-b)
What most drinkers know as German Dark beer is basically a Lager beer that
has an additional roasted malt thrown in to add complexity to the aroma and
palate. These dark versions of the Munich Pale Lager (Münchner-style Helles)
style tend to be somewhat sweeter and only marginally heavier on the palate;
most of this style’s reputation as being heavy and strong is exaggerated.
(Confusion reigns because any and every malt beverage with a color that
remotely resembles the amber band in the color spectrum is now branded a
dark beer.)
Ironically, all the original Münchner-made beers were fairly dark until the
introduction of Helles Lager earlier this century. Because of its widespread
popularity, most Bavarian brewers began making Helles Lager, thus making
the Dunkel style even less popular.
Flavor profile: Copper to dark brown. No fruitiness or esters should be expe-
rienced. Nutty, roasty, chocolatey, and malty characteristics may be notice-
able in the aroma and flavor. Low hop flavor and aroma are typical, as is
medium bitterness. Low diacetyl is acceptable. Medium-bodied.

primary and 3 weeks at 40 degrees Fahrenheit for the secondary.)

German-Style Helles Bock/Maibock 
(5-a)
German-style Helles Bock is a pale version of Traditional Bock. The profile is
similar except for the omission of the chocolate grain, which in essence
removes the chocolate flavors and most of the dark color. Maibock is a style
brewed for consumption in the month of May (Mai). It’s basically a Helles
Bock with a more pronounced hop character in the aroma and on the palate.
Some brands are even dry hopped for added bouquet.
Flavor profile: Pale to amber. No hop aroma, fruitiness, or esters. The malty,
sweet character predominates in aroma and flavor. Unlike the Traditional
Bock, it has no toasted chocolate-malt character. Low bitterness, low hop
flavor, and low diacetyl are okay. Medium-bodied.

Start with no less than 8 pounds of very pale hopped extract; steep 1.5 pounds of 10-L
crystal and strain into wort. Add 1 ounce of traditional German hops (Hallertauer,
Tettnanger) in the last 15 minutes of the boil. Adding 1 pound of light honey also adds an
interesting complexity to this style. Pitch a true Lager yeast and ferment at cool tempera-
tures for an extended period of time.

Traditional Bock (5-b)
The northern German city of Einbeck was the first center of commercial
brewing in the 13th century. Beer from Einbeck became known as Beck beer
(no relation to Beck’s beer). Beck beer was famous throughout the Hanseatic
League of cities on the North Atlantic but completely unknown in the south
of Germany. Beck beer’s eventual introduction to the south took place several
hundred years later, at the wedding of the Duke of Braunschweig to the
daughter of a wealthy aristocrat from the south. The wedding took place in
Bavaria in the early 1600s and was attended by nobility from distant states.
The Bavarians embraced the beer style from the north and adopted it as the
beer of choice in the state-commissioned Hofbrauhaus in Munich. The brew
soon became known as Bock beer — a corruption of Beck in the Bavarian
accent.
Bavarians like to downplay the Einbeck connection in favor of a local inter-
pretation of the beer’s origin. Bock means billy goat, which is the animal asso-
ciated with the zodiacal sign of Capricorn that rules over the months of
December and January, when brewers start making Bock beer. Yet another
version suggests that the male goat is a symbol of fertility synonymous with
the spring season. One thing is for sure — Bock beer is not what’s cleaned out
of the bottom of the vats once a year!
Traditional Bock beer is a hearty bottom-fermented beer with a generously
malty character and burnt toffee dark-grain flavors. It has a creamy mouthfeel
and the finish is lengthy and malty sweet. Hop bitterness is subdued — it’s
just enough to cut the cloying character of the malt. The color can run the
spectrum from a deep burnt orange to mahogany. The alcohol content is usu-
ally considerable; a true German Bock beer must have a minimum alcohol
content of 6.5 percent to be called a Bock.
Flavor profile: Deep copper to dark brown. No hop aroma, fruitiness, or
esters are evident. The malty-sweet character predominates in aroma and
flavor, with some toasted chocolate-malt character. Low bitterness, low hop
flavor, and low diacetyl are okay. Medium- to full-bodied.

Doppelbock (5-c)
Oddly enough, a religious order of Italian Monks invented Doppelbock. The
Order of St. Francis of Paula, cloistered high in the Bavarian Alps, developed
this distinctive brew to sustain themselves through periods of fasting. They
named this higher alcohol double Bock Salvator, in honor of the Savior; thus,
Paulaner Salvator was born. In reverence to the original, all subsequent
German Doppelbocks are given names that end in -ator. Most American micro-
brewers continue the tradition of using the -ator suffix, making Doppelbocks
easy to spot on a beer list or menu.
Flavor profile: Amber to dark brown. Slight fruitiness and esters are
expected but no hop aroma. The malty sweetness of this beer is evident in
the aroma and flavor and may be intense. Low bitterness, low hop flavor, and
low diacetyl are okay. High alcohol flavor may be present. Very full body.

ixed-style beers, or hybrids, are beers that cross the lines between 
conventional beer styles. These beers are fermented and aged 
with mixed traditions; one beer may be fermented with Ale yeast at cold 
temperatures, and another is fermented with Lager yeast at warm tempera-
tures. Sometimes — depending on the whims of the brewer — they may be
fermented either coolly or warmly as either Ales or Lagers.
This chapter provides beer recipes for the beer styles that don’t fit neatly
into the regular Ale and Lager categories. Note: I haven’t included all of the
hybrid beer styles and substyles listed on the AHA hierarchical list (on the
Cheat Sheet) in this chapter. Because certain beer styles are very difficult 
to produce at the homebrewing level without highly advanced information,
techniques, equipment, and ingredients, I decided to save you from them.

Cream Ale (6-a)
Cream Ale seems to be an American innovation. These beers are fermented at
cold temperatures with either Ale yeasts or blends of Ale and Lager yeasts.
The idea behind Cream Ale is to produce a pale beer of medium gravity, fer-
ment it with Ale yeasts, and age it cold like a Lager beer. Although the original
Cream Ales were produced this way, some brewers ferment newer versions
with Lager yeast or a mixture of Ale and Lager yeasts.
The cream part of the name has nothing to do with dairy products — pre-
sumably, the original brewers of Cream Ale wanted the name to suggest that
this style has a creaminess about it. It doesn’t.
Flavor profile: Very pale. Low fruitiness or esters are okay. Low hop flavor or
aroma is also okay. Faintly sweet malt character offers a low to medium bit-
terness. Light-bodied and effervescent.

Blonde Ale (6-b)
This somewhat-ambiguous style is widely popular at brewpubs (and not so
much at packaging breweries) because it appeals to the many light-beer and
non-beer drinkers who dine at these establishments. A blonde beer of any
style is code for a light-colored, light-bodied beer, though blonde Ales can
be — and often are — quite flavorful in spite of their lightness. No dumb

American Wheat (6-d)
American Wheat beers, although their ingredient profile may mirror the
traditional German-style Weizen, generally contain a lower percentage of
wheat malt (15 to 50 percent) and are typically fermented with a simple top-
fermenting (Ale) yeast. American Wheat beers, therefore, lack the clovey
phenolics, bubblegum, banana, and spicy flavors and aromatics of traditional
German Weizenbiers.
Flavor profile: Golden to light amber. Low to medium fruitiness and esters;
no phenolic character is evident. Malt and hop aroma and flavor are sub-
dued; low to medium bitterness is expected. Low diacetyl is okay. Light- to
medium-bodied.

Note: When you’re mashing malted wheat,
I recommend adding a pound or two of rice
hulls to the grist. Because wheat kernels are
huskless, the mash can compact on itself
and slow or stop the sparging and lautering
procedures. Adding rice hulls helps keep
the mash from compacting.

California Common Beer (7-b)
Steam beer, as it’s known and marketed in the U.S., is a style that can consider
itself one of the few indigenous American beers. Unfortunately, the brewery
that revived the style and developed the modern recipe has also trademarked
the Steam Beer name. By virtue of the fact that no other brewery produced a
beer of that style in the latter part of this century, the Anchor Brewing Co. in
San Francisco registered the Steam Beer designation as its own. Hence, the
style itself is now known as California Common beer.
California Common beer has roots in British brewing traditions and, in fact, is
still called Steam beer in the U.K. The Germans also developed a similar style
called Dampfbier (literally translated as Steam beer). Here in the United States
around the turn of the century, the style varied considerably from one brew-
ery to the next and was also known as swankey, small beer, and common.
One of the most obviously identifiable features of Steam beer/California
Common beer is its hybrid style. Whereas Ales use a top-fermenting yeast and
ferment at warm temperatures, California Common beers ferment warm but
use Lager yeasts designed for cold fermentation. Why the against-the-grain
approach? Although artificial refrigeration wasn’t in widespread use on the
West Coast at the time this style was developed, the new German Lager yeast
was both abundant and much less contaminated with the bacteria resident in
Ale yeast cultures. Similarly, high hopping rates also helped combat spoilage
and delay its unpleasant effects on the beer.
Today, precious few legitimate examples of this style are available to the con-
sumer, although many other beers have similar profiles. All-malt amber Ales
and Lagers that contain a percentage of caramel malt in the mash simulate
this beer’s palate. The hop bitterness you achieve by using the Northern
Brewer variety of hop, along with a pungent American hop variety bouquet,
also closely resembles the hop profile of this style.
Flavor profile: Light amber to copper. Medium-bodied. Has a toasted or
caramel-like maltiness in aroma and flavor. Medium to high hop bitterness.
Hop flavor is medium to high; hop aroma is medium. Fruitiness and esters are
low. Low diacetyl is okay.

Düsseldorfer-Style Altbier (7-c)
The concept of a German Ale has oxymoronic overtones. German brewers are
generally recognized as the world leaders in the production of high-quality
Lager beers, so imagining them creating original Ale styles may be difficult.
Because neither single yeast-cell isolation nor artificial refrigeration was at
anyone’s disposal in the early days of brewing, brewers had to work with what
they had: top-fermenting yeast strains. Thus, they created the German Ale.
One of these Ale styles is known as Altbier. The style is strongly associated
with the city of Düsseldorf, although it also has lesser ties to Münster and
Dortmund. The German word alt, contrary to popular belief, doesn’t mean ale
but rather old, a reference to Old World brewing styles. Modern-day Altbiers
are fermented warm, as is common to Ale styles, but they’re aged cold, as are
Lagers. The Altbier profile is deep amber to dark brown in color. The hop
blend is complex and can differ from one brewery to the next. German hop
varieties are typically best, but American domestic varieties suffice.
Flavor profile: Medium to high maltiness. Medium to high bitterness. Very
low in hop flavor with no hop aroma. Low fruitiness and esters. Light- to
medium-bodied.

Weizen/Weissbier (15-a)
Weizen beer is a spritzy Ale made by replacing some of the barley used in reg-
ular beers with a portion of wheat malt. These German-style Wheat beers
have unique fruity and phenolic aromas and flavors that result from the spe-
cific strains of yeast you use to ferment them. German-style Wheat beers are
alternatively known as Weizenbier or Weissbier. Of these two designations,
Weizen (meaning wheat) is more correct than Weiss (which means white);
these beers are typically a rich, golden color.
A traditional German Weizenbier must use at least 50 percent malted wheat,
with the rest of the grist being malted barley. Weizenbier clones made else-
where use anywhere between 25 and 75 percent wheat malt, depending on
the whims of the brewer. Traditional Weizenbiers also have a dose of yeast
added at bottling time for a secondary fermentation in the bottle. This state
is called Hefe-weizen (yeast-wheat). Homebrewed Wheat beer, if bottle-
conditioned (that is, primed with sugar), is automatically a Hefe-weizen.
Commercially, filtered kristalklar (crystal-clear) Weizenbier is also widely
available.
Flavor profile: Pale to golden. Very fruity and estery. Low hop flavor and
aroma. Clove and banana aroma and flavor are evident; vanilla, nutmeg,
smoke, and cinnamon-like phenolics are also acceptable. No diacetyl. Low
bitterness levels accompany a mild sourness. Light- to medium-bodied and
highly effervescent. This style may come packaged with or without yeast in
the bottle (Hefe-weizen or kristalklar).

You can easily make a wheat-flavored beer of sorts by using wheat malt extract. The tradi-
tional German-style Weizen, however, gets most of its character from the yeast. You can get
the fruity, estery, clovey, spicy aromas and flavors typical of true Bavarian Weizenbier only
by using true Weizen yeast strains (see the appendix for more information on yeast strains).

Note: When mashing malted wheat, I recom-
mend adding a pound or two of rice hulls to
the grist. Because wheat kernels are husk-
less, the mash often compacts on itself and
slows or stops the sparging and lautering
procedures. Adding rice hulls helps keep
the mash from compacting.

Dunkelweizen (15-b)
As with other beer styles, you can find many variations on the wheat-beer
theme. One such variation is Dunkelweizen. Meaning dark wheat, this style is
to regular Weizen what Münchener Dunkel is to Münchener Helles (see
Chapter 16). Plainly stated, this style is just a Weizen beer that’s darkened
and imbued with a mild chocolatey-caramelly flavor by the use of lightly
roasted crystal or Munich malts.
Flavor profile: Deep copper to brown. Low hop flavor and aroma, although
banana, cloves, and other phenolics may be present. Roasted malt and
chocolate flavors are evident but no diacetyl. Medium-bodied.

You can easily copy this beer style by starting with 5 to 6 pounds of wheat malt extract;
add to that 0.5 pound of chocolate malt steeped and strained into the brewpot. Keep in

Weizenbock (15-c)
Another variation on the Wheat beer theme is Weizenbock, which means
Wheat Bock. This style is similar to the Bock beer style in terms of richness
and alcohol content but owes much more to its Weizen origins. Made from a
high percentage of wheat malt (as are all German-style Wheat beers),
Weizenbock is also fermented with the traditional yeast strains that lend
their telltale fruity and phenolic aromas and flavors to the beer.
Flavor profile: Amber to dark brown. Banana and clove are apparent; hop
flavor and aroma are absent. Maltiness is high, bitterness is low, and no
diacetyl is apparent. Dark versions have mild roast and chocolate flavors and
aromas. Medium- to full-bodied.

Fruit Beer (20)
As a beer-style category, Fruit beer is a relatively new creation, but European
brewers have made beers with fruit in them for centuries. (Belgian-style Fruit
Lambic is one such example.) Today, however, spurred by consumer interest,
virtually every beer style known to man comes with a fruit variation.
Homebrewers wanting to emulate their favorite Fruit beer styles have the
advantage of using fruit extracts and syrups rather than real fruit. These fruit
flavors, easily found at well-stocked homebrew supply stores, run the gamut
from cherry to blueberry to marionberry. (Hey, wasn’t he the mayor of . . .?)
Flavor profile: Fruit beers often are made with an anything-goes approach. In
light of this approach, I have no way to accurately describe what you may
expect from one of these beers.

Herb, Spice, and Vegetable 
Beer (21-a)
Although you don’t see many Herb and Spice beers on your local beer retail-
ers’ shelves, a few do exist. If homebrewers had their say, many more would
be available. The Herb-and-Spice-beer category is one of the more popular
among homebrewers because it presents an almost unlimited number of
choices.
Herbs and Spice beers may include lemon grass, ginger (what — you’ve never
heard of ginger ale?), cumin, allspice, caraway, mace, pepper, cinnamon,
nutmeg, and clove, among myriad others. Some sage advice: Take the thyme
to peruse the spice section of your local supermarket — a mint-condition
spiced brew may curry favor with the beer judges.
Vegetables in beer, on the other hand, are very few and far between — and, to
my knowledge, no such thing as a vegetable extract is made for brewing — so
you’re pretty much limited to pumpkin and hot peppers here.
Flavor profile: Herb, Spice, and Vegetable beers are often made with an any-
thing-goes approach. In light of this practice, I have no way to accurately

Christmas/Winter/Specialty 
Spiced Beer (21-b)
Throughout history, drinkers have enjoyed beers of a somewhat higher alco-
hol content and richness during the winter holidays, when friends and neigh-
bors get together to enjoy the season. Many breweries produce unique
seasonal offerings that may be darker, stronger, spiced, or otherwise fuller in
character than their normal beers. Spiced versions are an American and
Belgian tradition, because English and German breweries traditionally don’t
use spices in their beers. Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made
Christmas beer; the special ingredients should complement the base beer
and not overwhelm it.
Flavor profile: These winter seasonal brews are often made with an anything-
goes approach. In light of this practice, I have no way to accurately describe
what one may expect from one of these beers.

Smoked Beer (22-b)
The Franconian city of Bamberg, Germany, is famous for its Bamberger
Rauchbier (Bamberg Smoke beer). This style, although very popular in north-
ern Bavaria, is rarely produced elsewhere in the world. Many beers are said to
be acquired tastes, but Rauchbier takes that description to a whole new level.
A beer gets its smoked character as a brewer kilns his malt over a wood fire
(typically beechwood, but sometimes alder, apple, or cherry) or peat fire.
The grain retains this smokiness and imparts this quality in the beer as it’s
mashed. How smoky the resulting beer is depends on how long you leave the
malt to smoke and how much of the grain bill consists of smoked malt. The
smoked character of the beer varies from one brewer to the next but is often
assertive and always noticeable.
But the use of smoked grains isn’t limited to making Rauchbier. You can
imbue any existing beer style with smoke aroma and flavor just by adding
smoked malt to the recipe. The trick to making a good smoked beer, however,
is achieving the perfect balance between the malt and the smoke. Porter is
one style that seems to be a particularly good host for smoke character. Just
remember to sip the beer and not inhale it.
Flavor profile: Dark amber to dark brown. The intensity of the smoke charac-
ter may be medium to high. You should notice a balance between smokiness
and the expected flavor characteristics of the base beer style. Smoky flavors
may range from woody to somewhat bacon-like depending on the type of malts
used. Peat-smoked malt can add an earthiness. The balance of underlying beer
characteristics and smoke can vary, although the resulting blend should be
somewhat balanced and enjoyable. Smoke can add some dryness to the finish.

Beginner suggestions
The quickest and easiest way to add smoke character to your beer is to use a high-quality
liquid smoke extract sold at most well-stocked grocery stores. The biggest drawback to
using smoke extract, however, is that the most common smoke flavor is hickory. That’s
why it’s advisable to buy traditional smoked malts from a homebrew ingredient supplier.
One to three pounds steeped in a 5-gallon batch should do the trick.

Wood-Aged Beer (22-c)
Aging beer in wooden barrels is a traditional production method rarely used
by major breweries these days, and even then usually only with specialty
products. The trend is becoming more popular with modern American craft
breweries looking to produce new and distinctive products. The beer is often
aged in wooden casks or barrels (traditionally oaken, although other woods
can be suitable) often previously used to store whisky, bourbon, port, sherry,
Madeira, or wine, but you can also achieve the same effect by using wood-
based additives (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence). Fuller-bodied,
higher-gravity base styles are popular candidates for barrel aging because
they can best stand up to the additional flavors.
Flavor profile: This varies with the base style of beer. Wood usually con-
tributes a woody, cedary, or oaky flavor. Other flavors that may optionally be
present include vanilla (from vanillin in the wood); caramel, butterscotch,
toasted bread, or almonds (from toasted wood); coffee, chocolate, and cocoa
(from charred wood or bourbon casks); and alcohol flavors from other prod-
ucts previously stored in the wood (if any). Watch for drunken termites.

The quickest and easiest way to add wood character to your beer is to add liquid oak
essence to your brew. Otherwise, you can add wood chips directly to your primary or
secondary fermenter while your beer is fermenting or aging. Oak is the standard wood
character in beer because it emulates the character found in barrel-aged wine and whisky.

Specialty Beer (23)
This category is the one that runs all over the map. Small brewers love to
create Specialty beers because the process involves so much freedom. Where
beer making is considered both an art and a science, Specialty beers defi-
nitely fall on the side of artistry. Although you must brew the vast majority of
the other beers I’ve profiled within tight constraints, Specialty beers have vir-
tually no parameters and few rules to follow.
You may as well call the Specialty-beer category the kitchen-sink category,
because everything but seems to go into these beers. You name it — fruit,
herbs, spices, unusual sugars, odd flavorings, and nontraditional grains all
contribute unique flavors to these offerings. Unusual sugars you can find in
maple sap, molasses, treacle, brown sugar, sorghum, and honey. Brewer’s
licorice and brewer’s chocolate make for odd flavorings in beer, and nontradi-
tional grains may include oatmeal and rye. (Sounds like a breakfast of the
gods to me.)
Beers in the Specialty category can be made with unusual techniques (super-
heated stones in the brewkettle) or unusual adjuncts (sorghum, buckwheat),
they can be regional (stronger, hoppier) interpretations of traditional styles,
or they can be historical/indigenous beers (Sahti, Colonial spruce or
molasses beers, Kvass). One thing Specialty beers can’t be is out-of-style
because this category has no style guidelines. Isn’t that special?
Flavor profile: Specialty beers are often made with an anything-goes
approach. In light of this approach, I have no way to accurately describe
what you may expect from one of these beers.

’ve included two chapters on making alternative bever-

Mead and Cider. Chapter 20 covers the organic movement
in the homebrewing sector and the opportunities to
become a green brewer.
Although all of that is about options and personal choice,
Chapter 21 deals with making a beverage that addresses
important dietary restrictions; gluten-free brewing is for
those who have no options or choice.

 Cider-making recipes
T
he art of homebrewing generally denotes brewing beer in one’s home.
However, this definition doesn’t necessarily exclude the options to make
other somewhat-similar fermented beverages such as Cider. It’s probably 
safe to say most homebrewers never try their hand at making a Cider, but
they already have all the equipment they need, so why not present the 
information in case the occasion should arise? Well, here it is. . .
Exploring the Cider Option
Once the most popular beverage in America, Hard Cider is making a come-
back of sorts, hot on the heels of the microbrewing revolution. In fact, some
suggest that Cider is now where craft brews were about 20 years ago and 
continues to grow in interest.
Hard Cider, for the uninitiated, is a fermented beverage made from the juice
of apples. (Regular, or soft, Cider is unfermented and therefore contains no
alcohol.) Hard Cider is predominantly a British drink, although its traditions
in the U.S. run deep. Its production may include optional ingredients such as
white and brown sugars and various other fruits and spices, depending on
the producer and the style.
Because of its combined acid and alcohol content, Cider also has a shelf life
that far exceeds that of beer.

Part V: Alternative Brewing 
Comparing apples to apples
The Cider-making industry uses a wide variety of apples. At their most basic
level, apples fall roughly into two categories: bittersweet and culinary. Most of
us are familiar with the culinary varieties, such as Granny Smith, Jonathan,
Macintosh, and Golden Delicious, but few of us know of the wide variety of
bittersweet apples that go by monikers such as Northern Spy, Kingston Black,
Golden Russet, and Newton Pippen. The culinary varieties are the ones cooks
use in apple pies or applesauce or that you just eat plain. The bittersweet
apple varieties tend to have thicker skins and elevated tannin levels (which
contribute the bitterness) and higher acid contents that make them less
desirable for common consumption.
The natural sugars you find in apples are mostly mono- and disaccharides,
which are both highly fermentable. The breakdown is approximately 
75 percent fructose, 15 percent sucrose, and 10 percent glucose.
Most brand-name Ciders are blends of the juices of different apple varieties,
which creates a wider spectrum of flavors. This blending also allows the
Cider producer to exercise more control over the Cider flavor — especially 
if one or more of the apple crops experiences a bad growing season. And
blending also results in a greater consistency in the finished product. The
largest Cider maker in the world (Bulmer, in England) uses 15 varieties of
apples to produce the various brands it markets.
Cider-bar
The word Cider appears to be a derivation of the
Hebrew shekar, which means “strong drink.”
The recorded history of Cider dates back to the
first-century B.C. Roman soldiers under Julius
Caesar, who discovered this drink while march-
ing across the Kentish countryside in southern
Britain and brought it back with them to Rome
(introducing it to the rest of western Europe
along the way). Following the Norman conquest
of England in 1066, the consumption of Cider
increased immeasurably. (Being from the north
of France, the Normans had no trouble appreci-
ating this Champagne-like beverage.) Under King
Henry VIII, England made deliberate attempts to
develop apple orchards for Cider-making pur-
poses. Cider production peaked in the 1700s, only
to lose ground due to the results of increased
taxation of Cider in the 1800s.
In the United States, Cider was the bever-
age of choice among the white Anglo-Saxon
Protestants who settled the original colonies, but
its popularity diminished in the mid-1800s, fol-
lowing the arrival of millions of German and
Eastern European immigrants whose preferred
drink was beer. Cider lost out again to the non-
alcoholic soft drinks introduced to the American
populace at the turn of the century.

267
Chapter 18: In-Cider Information
The key to making a good and enjoyable Cider is to find the correct balance
between the apple character (sweetness and flavor) and the natural acidity
found in Cider. Many people find the puckery tang of Cider a little too
assertive. If you count yourself among them, try adding a can of frozen apple
concentrate to the mix to intensify the apple flavor, or add honey or juices of
other flavorful fruits to cut through the acid levels in your Cider.
Some Cider makers even blend in a small percentage of pear juice, which is
less acidic, thus reducing some of the cidery bite. A Cider made from a 
majority of pear juice is rightly called a Perry.
The quality of your Cider depends greatly on your source of fermentable
material — in this case, apples or apple juice. Because apple pressing is
rather long and laborious, you could say it’s best left to the hard-core Cider
makers; the juice route is more appealing to homebrewers.
Sorting cider styles
The antiquated Anglo style of Cider, which originated in Britain, is generally
more tannic and Ale-like because of the Cider makers’ use of Ale yeasts 
and bittersweet apples. (The greater use of bittersweet apples is what sets
English Ciders apart from North American Ciders.) The Anglo style is also
more costly because it requires longer fermentations. The newer Continental
style, popular in the United States, is generally sweeter and more like
sparkling wine.
And speaking of sparkling wine, you can render Ciders and Perries with 
various levels of carbonation from still (uncarbonated) to sparkling (highly
carbonated). The level of mild carbonation in between still and sparkling is
called petillant, which isn’t to be confused with petulant (or flatulent, for 
that matter!)
According to competition guidelines set by the American Homebrewers
Association, you can produce Cider in any of the following styles:
 Standard Cider and Perry (Category 27)
• Common Cider (27-a) is made from culinary/table apples, with wild
or crab apples often used for acidity/tannin balance.
• English Cider (27-b) is made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp
apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making.

268
Part V: Alternative Brewing 
• French Cider (27-c) is made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp 
apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making. Note that
traditional French procedures use small amounts of salt and 
calcium compounds (calcium chloride, calcium carbonate) to aid
the process of pectin coagulation. You must use these additives
sparingly, however, unless you want your cider to taste salty.
The main difference between English and French ciders is that the
French use a slow or arrested fermentation, which leaves more
apple flavor and sweetness. Some French cider makers even add
apple juice after fermentation for a richer, sweeter apple flavor.
• Common Perry (27-d) is made from culinary/table fruit (pears and
apples).
• Traditional Perry (27-e) is made from pears grown specifically for
that purpose instead of for eating or cooking. (Many perry pears
are nearly inedible.)
 Specialty Cider and Perry (Category 28)
• New England Cider (28-a) is a cider made with characteristic New
England apples for relatively high acidity, with adjuncts such as
white or brown sugars or molasses to raise alcohol levels.
• Fruit Cider (28-b) is made with other fruits or fruit juices added (for
example, blueberry). Note that a cider made from a combination of
mostly apple juice and a little pear juice would be entered in this
category because it’s neither a standard cider nor a perry.
• Apple Wine (28-c) is simply a cider with a substantial amount 
of added sugar to achieve a higher alcohol content than a 
common cider.
• Other Specialty Cider and Perry (28-d) is an open-ended category
for cider or perry with other adjuncts such that it doesn’t fit any of
the categories above. This includes the use of spices and/or other
sweeteners.
Even though these style descriptions mention actual fruit, you can easily 
substitute high-quality natural fruit juice.
Ciders of any style may also range from sweet to dry, depending on the types
of apples you use, as well as the yeast strain you use to ferment the juice.
Furthermore, you may also serve Cider draft style, which is pasteurized and
filtered, or in the more natural farmhouse style, which is traditionally served
unfiltered from a cask.

If you’re looking for a few commercial Ciders for comparison tasting, try the
three most popular brands in the U.S.: Woodchuck, Seven Sisters Wild Horse,
and Cider Jack. Two lesser-known brands, Ace and Hornsby’s, come out of
California. The leading non-U.S. brands include Woodpecker, Strongbow, and
Blackthorn, all from the U.K.
Making Cider
Although the various Cider style categories open to homebrewers at competi-
tions are evidence of its acceptance and appeal, Cider making is still catching
on with homebrewers. This may be because Cider’s tart taste isn’t to every-
one’s liking, but it may just be that many homebrewers are unaware of how
easy Cider is to make. Technically, only one ingredient is necessary to make
Cider: apples (or apple juice)! No water, no yeast — just the forbidden fruit.
Okay, I’m misleading you just a bit. Apples (and freshly squeezed apple
juices), like grapes, do come complete with their own resident wild yeasts,
but for better control over the Cider-making process, I recommend you
destroy these uninvited apple yeasts by heating the juice to at least 180
degrees Fahrenheit, and then choose and add the proper yeasts. As far as
water goes, apple juice naturally contains a high percentage of water and
therefore doesn’t require dilution.
Before you embark on your Cider-making journey, be sure to check out 
the secondary fermentation procedures in Chapter 11. Cider making is very
similar to beginner extract brewing (see Chapter 10) except for the 
secondary fermentation process.
Because the amount of apple juice you buy represents the finished batch size
(remember, you’re not diluting), you must heat all of your apple juice. This
restriction means you either have to get a brewpot that can hold 5 gallons 
of liquid, or you have to heat your apple juice a couple gallons at a time until 
it’s all heated. I don’t recommend reducing your batch size because a lot of
damaging airspace may be left in your primary and secondary fermenters
that can cause oxidation problems later. The easy answer to this dilemma, 
if you choose to pursue small-batch brewing, is to simply buy smaller 
fermenters and carboys.
The first place to shop for apple juice is at your local grocer. Most large 
grocery stores carry at least a few different brands of apple juice and Cider.
But brand names aren’t as important as product contents. Juice that’s 
sugar-free and preservative-free is best.
269
Chapter 18: In-Cider Information

Part V: Alternative Brewing 
Some serious Cider makers prefer to buy their apple juice fresh from the local
farmers’ market or at roadside stands. This practice is fine, but keep in mind
that this juice (which often comes as soft Cider) isn’t pasteurized, and you
need to stabilize it before you pitch yeast into it. You also need to use such
juice quickly because unpasteurized and preservative-free apple juice soon
begins fermenting on its own! I don’t recommend boiling unfiltered apple
juice; the easiest way to stop wild and unintentional fermentations is to mix
sulfur dioxide in the juice, which you can do simply by adding one crushed
Campden tablet to the must (unfermented liquid). Winemakers use Campden
tablets regularly, and most homebrew supply shops stock them.
If you boil unfiltered apple juice, a semipermanent haze forms in the liquid.
Fruit pectin causes this discoloration, and after it sets (or gels), the only way
to remove it is by filtration. (It doesn’t affect the taste, however, and is hardly
worth the effort of filtering out.)
You can greatly enhance Cider (like some beer styles) with the addition of
fruits or fruit flavors, some spices, or even some other fermentable sugars
such as honey or brown sugar. Cider also benefits from long periods of aging
(anywhere from a couple of months to several months), so adding some 
more complex flavorings to your Cider is no big deal. You can add some of
these directly to the brewpot, and you should add some to the secondary 
fermenter (see Chapter 8 for flavoring ideas and procedures).
Cider Considerations: Recipes
With the following Cider recipes, you can produce an interesting libation
appropriate for special occasions, competition, or just for sipping with
friends. An added bonus is that you don’t have to buy any extra equipment —
your beer-brewing equipment is all you need.
Although making Cider is no more difficult than is brewing an extract beer,
you should be familiar with secondary fermentation procedures before
attempting these recipes (see Chapter 11). Because of this relative ease of
brewing, I haven’t broken these recipes out into beginner, intermediate, and
advanced levels.
Common Cider (27-a)
You make Common Cider without the addition of adjunct sugars or flavorings.
In England, where the Cider tradition began, Ale yeasts are preferable over
Champagne or other types; this use results in fruitier Ciders with more 
residual sweetness. Traditional Ciders should be light-bodied with a crisp
apple flavor.

New England-Style Cider (28-a)
New England-Style Cider is a very natural style, so spontaneous wild yeast fer-
mentations are okay. Because of the addition of white and brown sugars, New
England-Style Cider also sports elevated alcohol levels (8 to 14 percent).
Medium- to full-bodied, New England-Style Cider offers a pronounced apple
aroma and flavor, ending with a throat-warming finish.

 Appreciating Mead
 Mead-making recipes
A
lthough the product of homebrewing is usually beer, you can apply 
the same equipment and techniques to other tasty purposes as well —
specifically, making Mead. Many homebrewers never take a shot at making a
Mead, but in this chapter I give you the lowdown on Mead and its origins, as
well as some recipes, in case you ever get the Mead wanderlust.
Mulling Over the Mead Option
Mead is a simple fermented beverage made from honey and water; it’s also
one of the more natural and uncomplicated beverages known to man. Despite
its simplicity, however, Mead is intoxicatingly enjoyable — pun intended, 
of course — and when well made, it can rival the finest Champagnes in 
the world.
Throughout the millennia, Mead was believed to have curative, restorative,
and aphrodisiac qualities; how’s that for an uncomplicated beverage? The
concept of a honeymoon derives from the ancient belief that drinking honey
wine (Mead) for one full moon (28 days) was a way to increase fertility 
among newlyweds.
The honey bunch: Appreciating honey
To understand and appreciate Mead is to understand and appreciate honey.
Mead is, after all, a simple dilution of honey in water fermented with yeast.
Bees, of course, produce honey. After the energetic honeybee collects nectar
from flowers, it partially digests and regurgitates it in the form of honey. The
bees store the honey in their hexagonal honeycombs, which are also made
from bee excretions. (If that doesn’t make you appreciate honey, nothing will!)

Honey is highly fermentable because it’s mostly sugar. The quantities of 
natural sugars in honey vary from one variety to the next, but all honeys 
contain a mixture of fructose, glucose, and sucrose sugars. A small percent-
age of honey content is made up of unfermentable stuff such as aromatic oils,
gums, resins, fats, acids, and the bees’ digestive enzymes — yum! Taken as 
a whole, pure and natural honey is a healthy potion containing a handful of
minerals such as iron, potassium, and phosphorus and vitamins A, B, C, and
K. Unfortunately, the more processed the honey is, the fewer of these goodies
you’re likely to find in it.
The natural sugars you find in honey are mostly mono- and disaccharides,
both highly fermentable — very similar to what you’d find in fruit juice. What
are vastly different, however, are the flavor and viscosity of honey when 
compared to fruit juice.
Estimates reveal over a thousand different kinds of honey in the world, each
with a different color and flavor (though these differences may be miniscule).
Most commercially produced honeys are blends of various types, which
tends to foster homogeneity among them. Lighter honeys such as clover,
alfalfa, and wildflower are good for Mead making because their flavor contri-
bution is mild. Dark honeys, on the other hand, can be rather aggressive and
even harsh-tasting. For Meads with some taste complexity, pure varietal, or
single-source, honey is highly desirable. Varietal honeys are those derived
primarily from a single blossom. The downside is that most of the varietal
types are also fairly scarce and, therefore, often more expensive.
Here are some varietal honeys that produce very tasty Mead:
 Orange blossom
 Mesquite
 Fireweed
 Tupelo

Part V: Alternative Brewing 
The Meady muse
Mead is one of the most sublime beverages
known to man, but it’s most often referred to as
the “nectar of the gods.” Historically, Mead has
had strong ties to Norse Vikings, English kings,
and Celtic roustabouts (and all the sacking and
pillaging ascribed to them). Mead is often the
subject of poetic, even lyrical verse, and it fea-
tures prominently in ancient mythology and other
classic literature such as the Rig-Veda, the
Odyssey, Beowulf, the Kalevala, and the
Heimskringla (Norse King Sagas). Pliny, Plutarch,
Homer, Chaucer, Pepys, Shakespeare, Rabelais,
and Washington Irving all mention it in their
works as well. One notable work that doesn’t
mention Mead is the Bible, presumably because
of Mead’s close association with pagan gods.

Many brand-name Meads are typically made from a homogenous blend of
honeys, which pretty much guarantees consistency between batches. Those
Meads made from varietal honey usually broadcast that fact on their labels.
The honey-brew list: Mead styles
As previously mentioned, traditional Mead is rather uncomplicated and
pretty easy to make. Things start to get interesting when you use a single
variety of honey or start adding various adjunct sugars, spices, and 
flavorings to your Mead.
Just so you don’t get lulled into a false sense of familiarity with this honey-
based libation, brewers also divide Mead into substyles. Fermenting plain
honey and water produces traditional Mead, but by simply adding other 
flavorings and fermentable sugars, you can produce different styles of Mead.
Here’s a breakdown of Mead substyles:
 Braggot is Mead made with a portion of fermentable ingredients derived
from malted grain. In other words, braggot is part beer. (This style is
occasionally called brackett.)
 Cyser is Mead to which you add apple juice. (I guess that would make it a
cider-cyser.)
 Hippocras is a spiced pyment (a Mead made with grape juice and spices).
 Melomel (also called Mulsum) is Mead to which you add fruit juices
other than apple or grape.
 Metheglin is Mead to which you add herbs and spices. Gruit is the
common term that refers to a mixture of herbs and spices used to flavor
Meads.
 Morat is Mead to which you add mulberries.
 Pyment (also called Clarré by the French) is Mead to which you add
grape juice.
According to the American Homebrewers Association competition guidelines,
brewers can make Mead at home in any of the following styles:
 Traditional Mead (Category 24)
• Dry Mead (24-a)
• Semi-sweet Mead (24-b)
• Sweet Mead (24-c)
 Melomel (fruit Mead) (Category 25)
• Cyser (25-a) (apple Melomel)
275
Chapter 19: A Meading of the Minds

• Pyment (25-b) (grape Melomel)
• Other Fruit Melomel (25-c)
 Other Mead (Category 26)
• Metheglin (26-a) (spiced Mead)
• Braggot (26-b) (barley Mead)
• Open Category Mead (26-c)
All Meads, regardless of style, should exhibit these three qualities:
 Sweetness: Sweetness simply refers to the amount of residual sugar in the
Mead; a Mead may be dry, semi-sweet, or sweet. Sweet Meads shouldn’t be
cloyingly sweet or have a raw, unfermented honey character. Sweetness
is independent of strength; body is related to sweetness, but dry Meads
can still have some body. Dry Meads don’t have to be bone dry.
One of the keys to making a good and enjoyable Mead is to achieve the
correct balance between the honey (sweetness and flavor) and the acid-
ity in the Mead. Like brewers who use bitter hops to balance the natural
grain sweetness of beer, Mead makers need something to offset the cloy-
ing taste of syrupy sweet Mead. You can add powdered or liquid acids,
such as citric, malic, and tartaric acids, to Mead for flavor balance and
complexity. Well-stocked homebrew shops sell Acid Blend packets that
contain this exact mix of citric, malic, and tartaric acids.
Occasionally, due to a low original gravity or overly aggressive yeasts,
Mead can come out much drier than you intended. If your Mead turns out
this way, you can always add a little more honey directly to the Mead at
bottling time to sweeten it up. To avoid the possibility of exploding bot-
tles, however, you need to make sure all the yeast remaining in solution is
100 percent dead by using potassium sorbate (according to package
directions) to prevent renewed fermentation. Obviously, this tip applies
only to uncarbonated (still) Meads (see the next bullet).
 Carbonation: A Mead may be still, petillant, or sparkling. Still Meads
don’t have to be totally flat — they can have some very light bubbles.
Petillant Meads are lightly sparkling and can have a moderate, noticeable
amount of carbonation. Sparkling Meads aren’t gushing but may have a
character ranging from mouth-filling to an impression akin to Champagne
or soda pop. (Making a petillant or sparkling Mead is a simple matter of
adding additional fermentable sugar to the Mead at bottling time. Check
out Chapter 13 for more on bottling and carbonation.)
 Strength: A Mead may be categorized as hydromel, standard, or sack
strength. Strength refers to the alcohol content of the Mead (and therefore
to the amount of honey and fermentable ingredients used to make the
Mead). Stronger Meads have a greater honey character and body (as well
as alcohol content) than weaker Meads, although this isn’t a strict rule.
276
Part V: Alternative Brewing 

The vast majority of commercially made Meads you encounter are likely
middle-of-the-road Meads: standard, semi-sweet, and still. Unfortunately for
the non-brewing consumer, commercial Mead is nowhere near as widely
available as beer or wine — availability depends greatly on your local 
purveyor of adult beverages.
If you’re looking for a few commercial Meads for comparison tasting, try
scouting out Chaucer Mead, Lurgashall Mead, White Winter Mead, Redstone
Mead, Rabbit’s Foot Mead, or Jadwiga Mead.
Sweet Success: Making 
Magnificent Mead
Although homebrewing competitions have accepted Mead with open 
arms (and categories), Mead making is still not very common among home-
brewers. This unpopularity may stem from the fact that Mead is an acquired
taste, but perhaps the main obstacle is that many homebrewers are unaware
of how easy Mead is to make. After all, all you really need to make Mead 
is honey.
Okay, that statement is a bit deceptive. To make a tasty Mead, you need 
to dilute the honey with water and pitch it with yeast, but these are minor
points. Technically, unpasteurized honey may even spontaneously ferment 
if left in an unsealed container. I don’t think it would taste very pleasant,
though.
277
Chapter 19: A Meading of the Minds
Meager Meads
Why isn’t Mead more popular and available
today? Several factors have probably affected
the decline of Mead. One possibility is that wine
simply overtook it in popularity; grapes are, and
have always been, far more abundant than
honey, and the scarcity of any commodity
directly affects its price on the free market. As to
why more commercial wineries don’t produce
Mead, it’s probably as simple as a lack of aware-
ness and demand on the part of the consumer.
And the amount of time required for the proper
fermentation and aging of Mead can be excruci-
atingly long (but worth every month). The leading
source of Mead in the United States today is the
hobbyists (homebrewers and home winemakers)
who make it in their kitchens and basements. Of
the relatively few commercial Meaderies in the
United States, most of them are wineries that
have ventured into the Mead-making arena.

Choosing your honey
As you’re shopping for honey, check out the honey aisle of your local grocery
store. Most large grocery stores carry at least a few different brands of honey,
but keep in mind the vast majority of commercial honeys are blended and
homogenized — they’re all virtually the same. You may want to travel that
extra mile or spend that extra dollar to purchase a specialty or varietal honey
from a specialty food store, a roadside food stand or farmers’ market, or a
local beekeeper.
Some hard-core Mead makers prefer to buy their honey closer to the 
source — at the local farmers’ market or at roadside stands. Keep in mind
that this honey often isn’t pasteurized (or even filtered), and you need to 
stabilize it before you pitch yeast into it. The quickest way to kill unwanted
wild yeast or bacteria is to mix sulfur dioxide into the must (unfermented
honey and water dilution); you can do this by adding one crushed Campden
tablet to the must. Winemakers and Mead makers use Campden tablets 
regularly, and most homebrew supply shops stock them.
Boiling your honey to kill of any resident bacteria is also an option, but be
careful: Boiling may also kill off a lot of the delicate aromatics of the honey,
too. The best way to boil safely is to pour the honey into water that’s already
boiling and immediately turn off the heat. Stir well.
Sometimes raw honey begins to crystallize within its jar or container, which
makes it difficult to pour out. I’ve found that microwaving the container for a
few seconds causes the honey to quickly revert to its syrupy form.
Mead-iocre? Not! Fermenting your Mead
The brewer has a fair amount of control over the fermentation process; some
sweet Mead yeasts aren’t very alcohol-tolerant and cease fermenting before
they’ve consumed all the available sugars. On the other hand, liquid culture
dry Mead yeasts or Champagne yeasts are very alcohol-tolerant and con-
sume as much available sugar as they can. Given honey’s high degree of fer-
mentability and some yeast strains’ alcohol tolerance, your Mead could
conceivably end up with a final gravity of 0.999 or lower, which is even less
dense than water.
Most Meads start with original gravities greater than 1.080 and ferment down
to final gravities below 1.020. This level of attenuation results in alcohol
levels above 9 percent, which is equivalent to most table wines. For the
homebrewer, it takes about 12 pounds of honey in a 5-gallon batch to get to
this starting gravity point, but it’s not unheard of for Mead makers to use as
many as 15 to 18 pounds of honey in a 5-gallon batch. Figure on a dilution
rate of 21⁄2 to 3 pounds of honey per gallon of water to achieve the appropriate
starting gravity.
278
Part V: Alternative Brewing 

At high original gravities, however, yeasts have a tough time staying moti-
vated. It helps to make sure you’ve aerated the must before you pitch the
proper amount of yeast. In order to keep fermentation moving along, you may
need to rouse the yeast by agitating the fermenter or by racking the Mead
over to another vessel. Adding fresh, healthy yeast to a Mead already in the
secondary fermenter isn’t out of the question, either.
Consider using a yeast nutrient to aid in fermentation. Yeast nutrient is a
blend of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, nitrogen, zinc, and other trace 
elements designed to help wine and Mead ferment completely.
Don’t be surprised if your primary Mead fermentations continue for two
weeks to a month. Secondary fermentations typically last months rather than
weeks. Three to six months is the norm, but nine to twelve months isn’t out
of the ordinary for extremely high gravity Meads or those with lots of flavor
components that benefit from aging and melding, such as bold fruit flavors 
or aggressive spices. Some Mead makers who are fans of oak-aged white
wines such as Chardonnay can throw toasted oak chips into the secondary
fermenter as they rack the Mead into it.
Before you dive headlong into Mead making, take a look at the secondary 
fermentation procedures in Chapter 11. Check out Chapter 10 as well; Mead
making is very similar to beginner extract brewing except for the secondary
fermentation process.
Finally, you’re not just stuck with plain old honey-and-water Meads; like a 
lot of beer styles, you can jazz up your Mead by adding spices, fruits or fruit
flavors, or even other fermentable sugars like brown sugar. Because Mead
benefits from long periods of aging (anywhere from a couple of months to
several months), adding more complex flavorings to your Mead is no prob-
lem: Chuck ‘em in the brewpot or the secondary fermenter. (See Chapter 8 
for flavoring ideas and procedures.)

Chapter 19: A Meading of the Minds
Progress report: Progressive Mead
Another way (one that lives in legend as far as
I know because no one I associate with has
tried it) to make a high-gravity Mead is called
Progressive Mead. The idea is that you brew a
Mead of regular gravity and strength in a smaller
batch size to leave room in your fermentation
vessel. After the initial fermentation subsides,
you boil more, undiluted honey, cool it, and mix it
with the existing Mead as you rack it over to the
secondary fermenter. Along with the fresh dose
of honey, you may need more yeast and yeast
nutrient, too.
Because it’s progressive, you don’t have to stop
at a second helping of honey. As the legend
goes, you can continue adding more honey in
this fashion until you run out of space in your fer-
menter (or your yeasts die of alcohol toxicity).

I Mead a Drink: Mead Recipes
These Mead recipes, like the Cider recipes in Chapter 18, allow you to create
a tasty, competition-worthy concoction perfect for special occasions (even 
if that occasion is Wednesday). As a bonus, you don’t even need any new
equipment; your beer-brewing gear is perfect.
Because Mead brewing is pretty low-key, these recipes don’t offer separate
beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Be aware, however, that even
after you’ve bottled your Mead, it may not reach its peak flavor potential for
another 2 to 6 months.
Traditional Mead (24-a)
Traditional Mead is one of the least-complicated Meads to make. It’s a simple
mix of honey and water that you can ferment to various levels of sweetness.
The following recipe (Lindisfarne Libation) is on the dry end of the sweetness
scale.

Open Category Mead (26-c)
An Open Category Mead is one that combines elements of two or more other
Mead categories, or one that simply doesn’t fit the style description of any
other Mead category. These Meads are often made with an “anything goes”
attitude.

Going Green: Being an 
Eco-Friendly Homebrewer
In This Chapter
 Being an environmentally conscious brewer
 Brewing organically
W
ith all the talk these days of greenhouse gasses, carbon emissions,
ozone holes, and melting glaciers, the concept of green products and
practices are gaining steam (which isn’t necessarily a green energy source).
Green (for those of you who may have just awakened from a coma) generally
refers to anything that’s ecologically or earth-friendly. And it’s not just car
manufacturers who are becoming earth-conscious; even the international
brewing industry is turning green, so to speak, and homebrewers everywhere
are also doing their little part. This chapter takes a look at those products
and practices that juxtapose the concepts of brew and green. Solar-powered
brew kettle, anyone?
Brewing Green Beer: It’s Not Just 
for St. Patrick’s Day Anymore
Very few people begin homebrewing out of necessity because commercial
beer is readily accessible to just about everyone everywhere. But rather than
simply buy a product out of convenience, these brewers make the conscious
choice to spend their money, time, and effort on a pastime that isn’t inher-
ently easy or convenient. Now, with this same dedication and conviction,
many homebrewers are making the choice to spend additional money, time,
and effort to pursue the same hobby with the added challenges of brewing in
a way that many consider socially conscious. Ecologically friendly brewing
isn’t necessarily cheaper or easier, but, on the other hand, some aspects of
eco-friendliness can actually conserve resources — including your money.

Using the oft-repeated mantra of “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” as a starting point,
homebrewers have different avenues on which to begin their walk toward
eco-friendliness. Ultimately, each individual brewer has to decide which of
these practices is workable within his or her own circumstances. The follow-
ing sections provide some ideas to get you started in your quest to become 
a green brewer.
Reduce
The first step in brewing green is reducing your usage of anything that’s not
eco-friendly. Here are some ways to make brewhouse reductions:
 Your energy usage: Gas heat is typically more economical to use than
electrical heat and typically costs energy companies less to produce.
Wherever possible, consider brewing with propane gas on high-BTU 
so-called turkey-cooker burners.
284
Part V: Alternative Brewing 
Green with envy
Commercial breweries are leading the way
within the industry by employing green practices
specific to their operations. Not only are these
methods helping the breweries’ bottom lines, but
they’re also gaining positive attention from local
governments and the media. Some inspirational
examples:
 The Mad River Brewing Company received
an award from its home town of Blue Lake,
California, for reducing its solid wastes by a
whopping 97 percent.
 The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company of
Chico, California, was honored by Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger and awarded a
$2.4-million rebate by the local gas and elec-
tric company for installing an energy-
efficient power plant that lightened the load
on the municipal power grid while signifi-
cantly reducing air emissions.
 In 2003, Brooklyn Brewery in Brooklyn, New
York, was the first business in New York City
to operate on 100 percent wind-generated
electricity.
 The New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins,
Colorado, following its own mission state-
ment of “Ethical and Environmental Respon-
sibility,” has won several awards for its
dedication to environmental ethics. The
employee-owned brewery produces 100
percent of its own energy through the use of
wind turbines and a unique cogeneration
process by which bacteria produce methane
gas. (A couple of beers and a bowl of chili
usually work for me.)
 In Australia, the Foster’s brewing conglom-
erate is adopting a new brewing technology
that produces energy via brewery waste
products. Called a Microbial Fuel Cell, this
device feeds on organic substances like
sugar, starch, and alcohol found in brewery
waste water, which it then turns into Watts
and stores in a battery that can power 
various electrical components within the
brewery. In addition to creating energy, the
technology also leaves clean water and non-
polluting carbon dioxide as by-products.

Always allow for proper ventilation when using high-BTU propane 
burners. These are best used outdoors, away from flammable structures.
 Your energy needs: Jacketing (insulating) metal mash tuns, sparging
vessels, and brewpots conserves heat. Not only will you save energy, but
you’ll also likely attain higher temperatures more quickly and sustain
them longer.
 Your usage of non-organic brewing ingredients: Non-organic farming
adds tons of toxic chemicals to the earth’s soil and water each year. See
the “Organically Speaking” section later in this chapter for more on
organic issues.
Try growing your own organic hops at home. See Chapter 26 for more
details on this process.
 Your reliance on cleansers and sanitizers that aren’t environmentally
friendly: You can’t always avoid using environmentally unfriendly
cleansers and sanitizers, but reducing their use helps.
Two highly recommended environmentally friendly products are B-Brite,
which is a no rinse, non-toxic all-purpose cleanser, and biodegradable
Five Star PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash).
 Your electricity usage: If you use a refrigerator exclusively for your
homebrew, you can save a considerable amount of energy by investing
in a temperature controller (see Chapter 27). Most refrigerators maintain
a temperature range of 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If you raise the tem-
perature just 10 degrees, you can save enough each month on electricity
to pay for 1 batch of beer each year! And if you have a home kegging
system, a refrigerator tap can also help save energy. By dispensing your
brews from outside the refrigerator, you don’t have to open the door as
frequently, which significantly cuts down on the amount of energy
needed to keep your brews cold.
Reuse
Another way to brew green is to reuse as much as you can to avoid contribut-
ing more waste to the environment. Here are some things you can reuse in
your home brewery:
 Your cleaning and sanitizing solutions: It’s not unreasonable to keep
and reuse cleaning and sanitizing solutions that are only lightly used.
Consider disposing of them only after several uses; it won’t affect their
power.
I know one conservative homebrewer who cleans all ten of his beer kegs
one at a time by pouring the same sanitizing solution from one to the
next over a period of a few hours.
285
Chapter 20: Going Green: Being an Eco-Friendly Homebrewer

 Your cooling water: This can be the water you use to cool your brewpot
in the sink or the water that flows through your wort chiller. Think of
both sources as usable water for cleaning dishes, for watering house
plants, for mopping floors, for filling the dog’s water bowl — whatever!
The water that flows from wort chillers isn’t only drinkable, it’s also
already heated. Consider pointing the chiller outflow hose into a clothes
washing machine, or just use it to clean your home brewery when you’re
done brewing.
The water that emerges from a chiller immersed in a pot of just-boiled
wort may initially be as hot as 160 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. So let it
cool a bit before you give Sparky a bath.
 Your yeast: It reproduces by itself, for Pete’s sake! As I discuss in
Chapter 26, you can re-propagate your yeast and keep a yeast bank in
your fridge.
Recycle
Another way to brew green is to recycle as much as you can to reduce your
contribution to the world’s landfills. Here are some things in your home 
brewery that you can recycle:
 Your plastic and glass: When plastic equipment is no longer suitable for
brewing or when beer bottles or carboys break, don’t just throw them in
the garbage. Both are likely recyclable, which means they won’t add
unwanted and unnecessary volume to a garbage dump somewhere.
When I decide that a large volume plastic vessel is no longer usable for
brewing, I demote it to serving as a holding tank for reusable sanitizing
solution. This practice guarantees that I always have some at the ready
for that last-minute sanitizing of something I may have overlooked.
 Your grain: If you’re a gardener, grain makes an excellent addition to
compost piles. If you know anyone who owns any barnyard animals,
spent grain is also a great food source for horses, cows, pigs, and so on.
And you can always make high-fiber homemade bread with spent 
brewing grains.
Organically Speaking
Brewing organic beer is really not as difficult as you may think, especially
with the rapidly spreading interest in organic foods and ingredients.
Organically grown ingredients for beer making are slowly but surely trickling
down from the commercial brewing sources to homebrew supply shops. Rest
assured, as the interest in organic beer grows, so too will the availability of
organic ingredients.
286
Part V: Alternative Brewing 

Keep in mind, though, that you won’t find any real financial incentive for
brewing organic beer. This is but one of many steps toward becoming a green
brewer; the real incentive to brew organically is rooted in the deep satisfac-
tion of knowing that you’re not placing an added burden on the environment.
A commitment to sustainable agriculture and the environment are what 
brewing organic beer is really all about.
And, in case you’re concerned, the process of brewing organic beer is no 
different from brewing regular beer; you’re simply switching from non-organic
ingredients to organic ingredients. The only caveat to this generalization 
is that if you’re serious about maintaining high organic standards, organic 
ingredients and beer should never come in contact with any piece of equip-
ment that you previously used to store, brew, or ferment non-organic 
ingredients and beer unless you first thoroughly cleaned and sanitized it 
to remove traces of all the verboten pesticides and fertilizers.
Why use organic ingredients?
The following are some important — and somewhat opinionated —
considerations about organic brewing:
 Brewing organically allows you to brew better beer. Beer made with
organic ingredients tends to be much clearer without requiring 
chemicals or fining agents, which in turn results in a cleaner taste.
On average, organic malts have a lower protein content, which results in
reduced haze problems in your finished beer. Also, organic malts leave
no chemical deposits that may interfere with fermentation.
 Brewing organically can contribute to your overall health and well-
being. By using organic ingredients, you can avoid consuming the 
often-toxic chemicals farmers and food processing companies use.
 Brewing organically contributes to a better world. Organic farming
reduces erosion, soil nutrient depletion, water shortages, and pollution
by not using chemicals to fertilize crops or to fight pests and diseases.
Per acre, organic farming also provides more agricultural jobs than 
conventional farming.
By using organically grown ingredients to make your beer, you’re automati-
cally improving its purity. You’re also supporting the organic farming 
industry, which contributes to the amount of land farmed in a sustainable
and chemical-free way.
Beware of the urban myth that organic beers are less likely to produce 
hangovers due to their lack of chemicals — not true! Now where’d I put the
aspirin?
287
Chapter 20: Going Green: Being an Eco-Friendly Homebrewer

Tracking the trend
The recent movement toward organic farming and the production of organi-
cally grown foods is well documented. Domestic sales of organic food and
drink grew from $1 billion in 1990 to $14 billion in 2006, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA). It seems natural, then, that beer would
also follow the trend — and it has. By 2005, organic beer ranked with coffee
as the fastest-growing organic beverage. (Hmmm, pesticide-free caffeine or
pesticide-free alcohol — take your pick.) As of 2006, organic beer still repre-
sents less than 1 percent of U.S. beer sales, but those sales doubled to $19
million between 2003 and 2005, according to the Organic Trade Association.
The modern organic beer movement traces its roots to Brauerei Pinkus-Müller
in Münster, Germany, where the first all-organic beer was brewed in 1979 as the
result of the brewer’s disappointment in the declining quality of conventional
malt at the time. He found organic malt to be a superior substitute, and the

eventually influenced brewmasters abroad. In 1997, the USDA established the
National Organic Program, which opened the door for Morgan Wolaver to
found the first all-organic brewing company, Wolaver’s Organic Ales, in Santa
Cruz, California.
The worldwide brewing industry is making huge strides on the organic beer
sector, but American commercial brewers are lagging a bit behind. Perhaps
more brewers in the U.S. would make organic beers today if it weren’t for the
many challenges they face. For example, the organic certification process 
can be expensive and burdensome, and some of the raw ingredients can be
difficult to secure in bulk. It can also be expensive to maintain separate
equipment for organic brewing. Luckily, most homebrewers have an easier
time of it (for starters, you don’t have to be certified). But if you’re more
interested in drinking organic beer than making it, check out the nearby
“Perhaps you’d like to peruse our list of non-toxic beers?” sidebar.
Certifiably nuts: Determining 
what’s really organic
Simply put, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards 
for organic beer are the same as those for organic foods: ingredients must be
grown without toxic pesticides or synthetic fertilizers in soil free from chemi-
cals for at least three years, and genetically modified ingredients (GMOs) are
a no-no. Keep in mind this Organic Certification process is kind of a work in
progress. USDA regulations are likely to continue changing and modifying in
the future.
A GMO is a Genetically Modified Organism. GMOs are common in food produc-
tion, including genetically modified corn that may appear in the brewing
industry. The certified-organic label is a guarantee that the product doesn’t
contain GMOs.
I should add that this description is over-simply put. Although this may all
sound pretty straightforward, the specifics regarding how organically grown
ingredients affect brewing processes and exactly how to define organic ingre-
dients make this topic anything but simple. Check out the “It’s not organic till
the USDA signs” sidebar for all the boring details.
Unless you’ve memorized the entire list of the USDA’s organic certifications,
what you read on product labels ranges from vague at best to outright con-
fusing at worst. The four basic building blocks of beer are grain (typically
malted barley), hops, yeast, and water, and the following sections tell you
what you need to know about selecting organic versions of each.
289
Chapter 20: Going Green: Being an Eco-Friendly Homebrewer

In 1997, Seven Bridges Homebrewing Cooperative became a homebrew 
pioneer by becoming the first supplier to offer quality organic ingredients 
to homebrewers. It has since grown to become the world’s most complete
resource for certified organic homebrewing ingredients. It’s the only certified
organic homebrew retailer in the United States, which guarantees that all of
its organic products are fully documented and carry the USDA organic seal.

Water
In terms of volume, water makes up about 95 percent of beer. Assuming
you’ve got average filtered water, you don’t have to worry about organic
issues with it (and water isn’t considered an ingredient by the USDA anyway).
Grain
Next up is the grain. Malted barley is the primary source of beer flavor
and character, followed by wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, and so on. All of
these grains — malted or unmalted — now grow both organically and 
290
Part V: Alternative Brewing 
It’s not organic till the USDA signs
In order for a beer to qualify for organic certifica-
tion, the USDA requires that 95 percent of the
ingredients used be organic. In other words, it
must contain 95 percent organic ingredients, with
the other 5 percent being non-organic ingredients
on the USDA National List, provided that organic
equivalents aren’t commercially available in suf-
ficient quantity. Are you still with me?
Currently, the National List only contains five
items: corn starch, water-extracted gums, kelp,
unbleached lecithin, and pectin. Besides hops,
there are an additional 38 ingredients currently
under consideration for inclusion on the National
List.
This is how the USDA breaks down its organic
certifications according to Product Composition:
 A raw or processed agricultural product
sold, labeled, or represented as “100 percent
organic” must contain, by weight or fluid
volume, 100 percent organically produced
ingredients.
 A raw or processed agricultural product
sold, labeled, or represented as “organic”
must contain, by weight or fluid volume, not
less than 95 percent organically produced
raw or processed agricultural products.
Any remaining product ingredients must
be organically produced, unless not com-
mercially available in organic form, or must
be nonagricultural substances or non-
organically produced agricultural products
produced consistent with the National List.
 Multi-ingredient agricultural products sold,
labeled, or represented as “made with
organic (specified ingredients or food
group[s])” must contain, by weight or fluid
volume, at least 70 percent organically 
produced ingredients produced and han-
dled in accordance with USDA organic
specifications.
Thirsty yet? Read your labels carefully. . .

non-organically, so obviously, you need to be careful in choosing the grain
you use to make organic beer. And in addition to the standard organic regula-
tions against pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, watch out for grains
tainted with GMOs.
To keep this stuff out of your beer, the best place to start brewing organic
beer is with organic malt. Many brewers consider organic grain difficult to
work with when compared to non-organic grain. Non-organic malt is easy to
handle because of the uniformity in the barley kernels, and, unfortunately,
uniformity falls victim to organic practices. Other than this disadvantage, 
you can substitute organic malts pound-for-pound in your favorite recipes.
One big plus is that organic malts have a slightly higher conversion rate than
conventional malts, so you can consider reducing the amount of organic
grain in your recipe by 1 or 2 percent. Specialty malts are pretty much 
interchangeable.
The heading of organic malt also encompasses extracts produced with
organic ingredients. As of now, only one organic malt extract is available to
homebrewers. Fortunately, it’s a pale, unhopped extract, which gives you a
lot of leeway in your recipe formulation.
For homebrewers and beer lovers who may have grain-related food allergies,
you can also find a small variety of gluten-free grains available, including 
buckwheat, millet, and quinoa. See Chapter 21 for more on gluten-free 
brewing.
Hops
Hops constitute the next-largest percentage of brewing ingredients, but 
their certification, status, and viability are currently in a state of flux (I think
that’s near Rhode Island). Yes, you can get organically grown hops, but 
not in great quantities; hops are subject to a variety of diseases and other
growth-related problems. Quite a bit of confusion also surrounds the need 
for organic hops in the first place. Most small organic brewers insist on 
using them to make their products 100 percent organic, or at least to make
their beers USDA Organic Certified (95 percent organic ingredients). Larger
breweries argue that because hops constitute less than 5 percent of the total
ingredient profile of their beers, beers brewed with non-organic hops still
qualify for organic certification. And the debate rages on. . .
Hops are notoriously difficult to grow organically because they’re subject to
many diseases such as wilt, mildew, and hop mites. (See Chapter 5 for more
on hops.) This is why no large-scale commercial hop grower in the United
States has taken the risky leap to organic hop production. Currently, most of
the few organic hop varieties available in the U.S. are imported from New
Zealand, Germany, and the U.K. Of course, this scarcity affects the brewers’
bottom lines as well; imported organic hops are 20 to 30 percent more 
expensive than conventional domestic hops.
291
Chapter 20: Going Green: Being an Eco-Friendly Homebrewer

Yeast
Finally, yeast is the last puzzle piece. Yeast itself is organic, but the liquid
medium in which you propagate it will have an effect on its organic certifica-
tion. If the grain-based wort was produced from non-organically grown grain,
the yeast is considered non-organic. Eco-friendly homebrewers can also get
specially packaged yeast; ask your homebrew supplier about their selection
of organic yeast.
Adjuncts
Those brewers who like to use adjunct sugars in their beers can rest assured
their interests are being looked after as well. In addition to organic rice
syrup, brewers may also find cane sugar, corn sugar, and malto-dextrin in the
organic market.
Be aware that corn is one of the most genetically modified crops, and the
USDA has no labeling requirements for GMOs. Because of this ambiguity, you
can’t be sure that any corn product, including corn sugar, is free from GMOs.
To completely avoid GMOs, use a substitute for corn sugar such as malt
extract or organic cane sugar.
More-intrepid brewers can also find a wide variety of organically grown herbs
and spices. If you can’t get these from your favorite homebrew supplier, your
average organic food store probably stocks them.

Gluten-Free Brewing
In This Chapter
 Discovering gluten
 Dealing with gluten intolerance
 Brewing gluten-free beer
I
magine going the rest of your life without beer; what a depressing thought!
Unfortunately, some very real physical conditions make beer consumption
difficult for many people. Luckily, beer made without gluten-filled products
provides a glimmer of hope for these folks. For sufferers of gluten intolerance,
brewing their own beer at home presents an opportunity to continue enjoying
their favorite beverage without the risks normally associated with their condi-
tion. Honestly speaking, beers made from gluten-free grains aren’t likely to
match regular beer for taste and quality. But to someone facing a lifetime beer-
drinking restriction (gasp!), gluten-free beer is like manna from Heaven —
made without gluten, of course. This chapter is all about brewing these gluten-
free beers at home. Don’t worry: The processes are largely the same; you just
have to be more careful about the ingredients you choose.
Getting to Know Gluten
As I detail in Chapter 4, brewers have used many different grains to brew
beer over the millennia. Barley is the most popular because of its many posi-
tive attributes and contributions toward making good beer. Wheat runs a
close second in grain preference, distantly followed by rye. The problem with
these grains — at least for people who suffer from celiac disease—is they all
contain gluten.
Gluten, which is a combination of the proteins gliadin and glutenin, is responsi-
ble for triggering an autoimmune reaction in the small intestines of people with
celiac disease. That reaction can be very debilitating, causing the sufferer great
discomfort and possibly long-term disruption to the function of their small
intestine. This means they don’t get the nutrients they need out of their food
and may experience a range of other health issues as well. The only treatment
available to people with gluten intolerance is a lifelong avoidance of products

that contain gluten. That means no regular beer in their diets. (Check out the
“More about celiac disease” sidebar for more information.)
Gluten helps make bread dough very elastic (so the yeast can make it rise)
and gives the bread its characteristic chewiness. As a component of barley,
wheat, and rye, gluten gives beer a thickness and chewiness as well.
In response to the growing demand for gluten-free beers in the commercial
market, several breweries around the world introduce new gluten-free prod-
ucts each year (see the nearby “No disputin’ gluten-free beers” sidebar for a
list). England even hosts an international gluten-free beer festival each year.
Because “gluten-free” constitutes a health claim, current U.S. beer label regula-
tions don’t allow the term “gluten-free” to appear on any beer sold in the
United States. Look for an ingredient listing of grains that don’t contain gluten.
From Intolerant to Tolerable: Brewing
Gluten-Free Beer at Home
Let me set the record straight here: Gluten-free beers don’t taste exactly like
regular beers. Compared to regular brewing, the ingredients available for
gluten-free beer are limited, so you have to use your imagination when 
formulating your gluten-free beer recipes. I address this topic in greater detail
a bit later.
Readying your equipment
One of the first considerations for the at-home brewer is making sure their
equipment doesn’t cause cross-contamination. In other words, if you’ve 
previously brewed regular beer in the equipment, you need to redouble your
cleaning efforts. This includes everything from your grain mill (if you brew
all-grain) to your brewpot, your fermenters, your transfer hoses, your bottles,
and every piece of equipment in between. Don’t take chances here; even the
minutest traces of gluten can make a celiac sufferer ill. See Chapter 3 for
details on proper cleaning and sanitation practices.
Substituting safe ingredients
The next consideration is where to obtain the appropriate ingredients for
brewing gluten-free beer. Start with the easiest parts: Neither water nor hops
play any part in gluten-free brewing, so don’t worry about these ingredients.
Just brew with what’s readily available. The main ingredient concern is the
fermentable grain or starch you plan to substitute for the glutinous barley or
wheat you use to brew typical beers.

 Malt or malt flavoring
 Malt vinegar
 Rye
 Wheat (including durum, semolina, kamut, and spelt)
 Triticale (sometimes used in brewing)
Although sorghum and buckwheat are the most commonly substituted
gluten-free grains (check out the “Sorghum and buckwheat” sidebar), you
have plenty of options when you’re looking for safe grains and starches:

More about celiac disease
Celiac Disease is also known as gluten-sensitive
enteropathy, gluten intolerance, or celiac sprue.
Gluten intolerance is an auto-immune response
some people’s bodies have to gluten; this reac-
tion damages the lining of the small intestine. The
result is that nutrients quickly pass through the
small intestine instead of being absorbed.
Estimates show that 1 in every 133 people in the
United States may be affected by this chronic,
inherited disease that can ultimately lead to mal-
nutrition if not treated. The disease is permanent,
and damage to the small intestine will occur
every time a sufferer consumes gluten, even if he
or she doesn’t experience any symptoms.
 Sorghum
 Buckwheat
 Rice
 Corn
 Soybeans
 Potato
 Beans
 Tapioca
 Quinoa
 Millet
Note: Although consuming uncontaminated oats in moderation (1 cooked
cup a day) is considered safe for the average celiac sufferer, health profes-
sionals are concerned that most oats may be cross-contaminated with 
glutinous grains.
The following sections suggest other safe ingredient substitutes.

Extract-ly what you need
Fortunately for the extract brewer, a couple of products on the market 
make life easier for the celiac sufferer. At least one major maltster in the U.S. 
markets white sorghum syrup. Pound-for-pound, this syrup is equivalent 
to regular malt extract, and you can use it in the same way. Be sure to read
labels, however; in at least one of these products, processors add simple
sugars (white cane sugar, honey) during production. This added sugar 
creates a more-fermentable beer, which typically results in a drier beer.
This point is where your imagination kicks in. In order to keep your beer
sweet and flavorful, consider adding flavorings, adjuncts, herbs, and spices
to keep it interesting. Try using corn or rice syrup, molasses, treacle, brown
sugar, or fruit juices and the like to make your gluten-free brew unique.
Gluten-free but flavorful
Yet another way to enhance your beer with grain-like flavors without any con-
cern about gluten is to roast your buckwheat or sorghum. If you like roasty-
toasty flavors in your beer or you want to make your brew a little darker,
consider roasting some raw sorghum or buckwheat grain in your oven and
steeping it in your wort as you would a specialty malt. Simply spread about a
pound of grain on a pizza tin (or similar apparatus) and roast for 10 to 30 min-
utes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (depending on the degree of toastiness you
desire). You can use this roasted grain immediately or store it refrigerated in a
sealable sandwich bag. You can use anywhere between a 1⁄4 pound and a full
pound in a single batch for more complex beer flavor and overall character.
Depending on your source of gluten-free grains, be aware that some grains
may be sold as seed and not intended for human consumption. This seed may
be treated with junk you don’t want to be drinking in your beer later on.
Brewing gluten-free beers from all grain
For you all-grain brewers who want to try your hands at making gluten-free
beer, listen up. . .er, uh, read carefully. This undertaking has a degree of
296
Part V: Alternative Brewing 
Sorghum and buckwheat
Sorghum is a valuable food source in its native
northeast Africa. It’s a vigorously growing grass
that tolerates the African climate very well, which
makes it a common ingredient in African beer.
Buckwheat, which traces its roots (no pun
intended) to central and western China, is 
actually an herb. Its nuts are milled, separating
the edible interior (called groats) from its outer
husk. The groats are then roasted and used as a
grain. Buckwheat blossoms are also full of nectar,
which makes them popular on beekeeping farms.
Hmmm, now I’m thinking Mead. . .

difficulty above and beyond brewing regular all-grain beers. The first consid-
eration here is finding the right grains in sufficient quantity at a reasonable
price. You also have to make sure they’re the malted variety. As always, start
with your local purveyor of homebrew supplies. If your favorite homebrew
shop doesn’t stock them, you should be able to find many gluten-free grains
in better supermarkets or health-food stores. If not, try searching for them
online. Finding the right grains can be somewhat expensive but well worth
the price and effort for someone who can’t drink beer otherwise.
As always, when making beer from all grain you must first mash your grain.
One of the main challenges in mashing gluten-free grains is that they’re low 
in diastatic power. In other words, they lack the requisite enzymes for conver-
sion. (Check out Chapter 12 for more on mashing procedures.) You might
want to consider adding amylase enzyme to your mash water — about 
1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water. (See Chapter 9 for more information about
enzymes.)
Another issue with gluten-free grains is that many of them—including
sorghum — are huskless. This deficiency means you need to add about 
1⁄2 pound of rice hulls to your mash in order to lauter and sparge efficiently.
If you choose to forego mashing and attempt to gelatinize your gluten-free
grains, be aware that the gelatinization temperature of the starches in most
gluten-free grains is higher than that of regular brewing grains. With sorghum,
corn, and rice, the gelatinization temperature is about 180 degrees Fahrenheit,
but these grains contain fewer required enzymes to convert the starches to
soluble sugars. Adding an amylase enzyme preparation (about 1 teaspoon per
5 gallons of water) is helpful in this regard.
Armed with this knowledge, formulating a recipe for gluten-free beer is no dif-
ferent from any other regular beer. Simply substitute your favorite gluten-free
grain for barley or wheat. For yeast suggestions, check out the next section.
Last, but not yeast
The last of the four principal beer ingredients is yeast. Yeast by itself isn’t
harmful to people with celiac disease. Therefore, you can use dry yeast to fer-
ment any gluten-free beer as long as you rehydrate it in plain water (with no
malt products). What is harmful to celiac sufferers is the liquid medium in
which commercial yeast is propagated; the base solution of this medium is
typically wort derived from barleymalt.
So if you make a liquid yeast starter at home, it must be gluten-free, too. If
you use a normal yeast strain, you need to plate out the yeast on a petri dish
or slant and then propagate the culture from a single yeast colony by using
molasses or sorghum syrup as your culture media. As always, you must carry
out all these processes in a very sterile environment.

At yeast someone cares
Due to an increase in celiac disease, gluten intol-
erance, and wheat and barley allergies, produc-
tion of gluten-free products is one of the
fastest-growing sectors in the food industry. At
least one yeast laboratory has responded to the
need for specialty brewing yeast: Wyeast’s
gluten-free yeast is a natural extension of the
demand for gluten-free beer.
After months of research and development,
Wyeast Laboratories now offers two of its most
popular liquid yeast strains in gluten-free form.
Yeast vitality, cell count, and recommended
pitching rates are comparable to Wyeast’s cur-
rent popular products.
Wyeast 1272 GF American Ale II and Wyeast
2206 GF Bavarian Lager are now available to
craft brewers by special order. Check with your
local homebrew shop for more details.

eer drinkers don’t typically have to face the prospect of storing large
quantities of beer for long periods of time, but you’re a homebrewer
now, and the rules are different. With each batch of brew you make, you pro-
duce the equivalent of slightly more than two cases of bottled beer. And this
stuff isn’t just any beer; it’s homemade, it’s unpasteurized, and it’s technically
alive. (Remember: Some yeast is still at work in each bottle.) This kind of
beer requires — and deserves — a little more attention. How you store and
pour your homebrew can make a world of difference in how it tastes. In this
chapter, I give you the lowdown on the proper storage of your homebrew, as
well as some pouring techniques and tips for glass selection. I also discuss
the pros and cons of different glass-cleaning methods.
Storing Your Suds
Average commercial-beer drinkers don’t need to concern themselves with 
the correct storing of beer because they usually purchase and consume it
within a couple of days (if not hours). For homebrewers, however, this issue
is worthy of attention; after all, they’ve put a lot of time and effort into their
finished product.
The term finished product (when used in conjunction with homebrew) is 
actually a misnomer. As long as live yeast is in the bottle, the beer is never
really a finished product — it continues to change over time.

How do I store it?
Unlike wine bottles, homebrew bottles don’t need to be stored horizontally.
Wine is stored this way to keep the cork from going dry — which is not a
problem with bottle caps. Actually, keeping your beer bottles standing
upright minimizes the beer’s contact with any oxygen that has also been
sealed in the bottle with the beer.
What’s most important about storing your homebrew is making sure the beer
is in a location in your home that’s cool and dark, because both heat and
light can destroy beer flavor.
Where do I store it?
For the first two weeks after you bottle your brew, you want to store it in a
cool (50+ degrees Fahrenheit), dark location while it silently conditions
(clarifies and carbonates). Back away from the fridge — it’s too cold for this
brief conditioning phase. Your brew eventually becomes clearer, and the 
carbonation level gradually increases. To satisfy your curiosity, you may
want to open a bottle every couple of days during this time to keep tabs on
your beer’s progress. Or you can simply give a bottle a little jiggle and see
whether bubbles emerge from the beer.
After you’ve conditioned your brew to your liking, you need to store it in the
coolest and darkest place possible (without freezing it) to stunt the yeast
activity within the bottle and to protect it from those elements that will cause
your beer to deteriorate, such as heat and light.
Your best storage bet is an Alpine cave, but a spare fridge or cool, dark spot
in your basement is sufficient. I realize that not everyone has the luxury of a
spare refrigerator or even a basement, so, forgoing these possibilities, a
crude beer cellar is better than nothing at all — consider using a ground-level
interior closet, a crawl space, or even an abandoned root cellar. Hey, if you’ve
got little to work with, you need to be flexible. And the closer you can get to
serving temperature (42 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit), the better.
The two most important criteria for this beer cellar are that it be cool and
that it be dark. You want to factor in accessibility at some point; what good is
an effective beer cellar if it effectively keeps you from easily getting a beer?
You don’t want to use a garage for storing your beer. Garages, unless thermo-
statically controlled, experience wide temperature fluctuations on a daily
basis, and they usually get way too hot or way too cold (depending on your
geographic location and the time of year). But a spare fridge in your garage,
well, now you’re talking!
302
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

How long do I store it?
By and large, you want to consume homebrewed beer fresh, typically within
three months of bottling. However, a handful of beer styles not only stand 
up well to storage but actually improve with short-to-long-term aging. The
styles that fit this category are all high-gravity beers: Barley Wines, strong
Ales, Imperial Stouts, Triple Bocks, some of the Belgian Trappist styles, and
especially Meads. Although many beers are still good after several months,
the hardiest beers are likely to improve over a number of years.
Pouring Procedures
The simple act of serving a beer doesn’t need to be done with a flourish, but
it does go a bit beyond drinking beer straight out of the bottle. This fact is
especially true when serving homebrewed beer.
Correct presentation of any beer automatically includes glassware or even
plastic ware (as long as it’s clean). Appearances aside, the underlying 
concept here is that, by pouring out the beer, you release much of the pent-
up carbonation. This frothing effervescence creates the beer’s head, releases
the brew’s aromatic bouquet, and lessens its carbonic bite.
Speaking of aromatic bouquet, less gas trapped in the liquid means less gas
trapped in your intestinal tract.
Out of the bottle. . .
With homebrew, most people — even most homebrewers — prefer to leave
the yeast dregs in the bottle. (These can taste pretty nasty.) Mastering this
pouring technique requires patience, timing, and a steady hand — especially
if you’re pouring your beer into more than one glass. Not to belabor the
point, but careful pouring has a lot less to do with clear beer than it does
with clear air — live yeast continues the fermentation process within your
digestive system, which often results in excess, um, flatulence. Be aware that
jostling your bottles of homebrew causes the yeast sediment to cloud up the
beer. Either handle the bottles gently or allow the yeast to resettle to the
bottom of the bottles.
Absolutely nothing is wrong with drinking the yeast sediment, which is actu-
ally high in the water-soluble B-complex vitamins — unless you have some-
thing against bloating and gas. Apparently this is not a problem for fans of
hefe weizen, which is traditionally served mit Hefe, or with the yeast.
Of course, you don’t have to worry about clean pouring if you choose to filter
your homebrew. (See Chapter 27 for more about filtering.)
303
Chapter 22: Storing and Pouring

The best way to pour a beer is to just plop it right down the middle of the
glass, and starting with a glass large enough to hold the full contents of 
the bottle really helps. A huge head forms immediately, so you may want 
to slow the pour or tilt the glass slightly as the beer nears the top. You also
want to be a little less aggressive when pouring Wheat beers or any brew 
that includes wheat malt as a heading agent, as well as any homebrew that’s
getting on in age. A true head is at least 1 inch thick, or two fingers in depth.
One of the finer points of beer presentation that too many drinkers often
overlook is the correct serving temperature. Most beers are served much too
cold for serious appreciation. The average refrigerator is set to keep things
chilled to around 38 degrees 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I can think of at least
three reasons not to serve your beer this cold:
 The colder the beer, the less carbonation it releases and the smaller 
the head.
 The less carbonation a beer releases, the less aroma it gives off.
 These temperatures numb the palate to the point that it can’t discern
many of the beer’s flavor nuances (which explains why American 
mass-market beers are best served just above the freezing mark).
Although you must make a little extra effort and plan ahead to serve beers 
at their correct temperatures, the rewards are great. Drinking beer at the 
correct temperature enables you to smell and taste all that the beer has to
offer. Serve most Lagers between 42 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit and most 
Ales between 46 and 52 degrees Fahrenheit. Authentic Stouts can be served
as warm as 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which is British cellar temperature. Most 
high-gravity Barley Wines and strong Ales are best lightly chilled or at room
temperature, like a snifter of brandy.
To save time as you clean and sanitize your bottles for your next brew,
always rinse each bottle thoroughly after you empty it and then store it
upside down. If you drink your homebrew from a keg, always clean and rinse
the keg thoroughly after it’s empty, too. See Chapter 14 for keg cleaning
instructions.
. . . and into the glass
Stylish beer glassware serves primarily as a commercial product enhance-
ment. Beyond visuals, however, the various shapes and sizes of beer glasses
play an even more meaningful role. Specialized beer glassware enhances the
aromas of the beer — for example, glasses that are deep or that curve inward
toward the top are very effective in capturing and concentrating a beer’s
aromas.
304
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

The act of pouring beer into a glass (known as decanting) also enables 
carbonation to escape from the beer and lets the beer warm a bit if you’ve
served it too cold. Decanting also allows you to pour a clearer beer if you’re
not partial to the yeast sediment in a homebrewed beer.
In the realm of tradition, many beer styles actually have a glassware style
dedicated to them. A Pilsener beer, for example, belongs in any of the many
tall, stemmed, or hourglass-shaped Pilsener-style glasses. A Stout, on the
other hand, is perfectly at home in a simple pint glass. The nice thing about
beer glassware, however, is that you’re not bound by any hard-and-fast rules.
General rules on beer glassware suggest that simple beers can be served in
simple glasses; well-aged and expensive beers deserve the regal treatment.
Figure 22-1 shows you several different types of beer glasses; the following
list helps you decide what to put in them:
 Aromatic Trappist Ales and Belgian Fruit beers for thin, stemmed glasses
 Rich and spirituous Barley Wines, Old Ales, and Imperial Stouts for

Chapter 22: Storing and Pouring

 Light, spritzy, and aromatic beers for tall, narrow glasses
 Wheat beers for thick glasses (which help keep the beer cooler longer)
 Strong beers for deep, tulip-shaped glasses
The following list demystifies a few of the many specific glass styles that you
may encounter anywhere today, as well as their suggested uses:
 Beer flute: This slim and dainty glass with a stem and base can be 
used for Pilseners and similar beers; however, it’s meant for beers that
emulate wines, such as Belgian Fruit beers. Flutes emphasize the 
aromatics of beer.
 Dimpled pint mug: This glass used to be the standard drinking vessel in
British pubs. It has slowly and quietly given way to the straight-sided pint
glass, which is easier to store on crowded pub shelves. Wherever you
may find it, the pint mug is well suited to English Ales and Bitters.
 Goblet: Used almost exclusively for Berliner-style Weissbiers, this glass
has a chalice-like appearance, with a wide, shallow bowl and a heavy
stem and foot. This shape discourages excessive head formation; addi-
tionally, the drinker’s nose fits inside the glass’s mouth, which enhances
the aromatic experience.
 Pilsener: Pilsener glasses come in a variety of styles. The more elegant
ones are tall, footed, wafer-thin glasses that hold 10 or 12 ounces. 
The more common versions are usually either hourglass shaped or tum-
blers that are slightly flared at the top. These ordinary Pilsener glasses
hold between 8 and 12 ounces and were designed specifically for 
Pilsener beers.
 Pint glass: The pint glass is probably the most pedestrian and inter-
changeable beer glass. The standard shaker (so called because bar-
tenders like to use this glass for shaking mixed cocktails) pint glass is a
thick glass that tapers outward toward the top and holds 16 ounces of
beer. (Before you say “duh!” read on.) You can also find an imperial pint
glass that holds 20 ounces of beer, but it’s not common in the U.S. This
style of pint glass is perfect for any style of beer.
Pint glasses of both sizes can be found with sleeves — bulges near the
top of the glass that protect its lip from nicking if the glass tips over. 
The sleeve also enables you to stack the glasses one inside the other
without them becoming wedged. Another style of pint glass is a slightly
curvaceous version of the standard pint called a pub glass.
 Thistle: Thistle glasses help intensify a beer’s aroma. The silhouette of
the thistle glass is exactly what the name implies: it resembles a thistle
flower. Drinkers use this uniquely-shaped glass almost exclusively for
strong Scottish Ales. (The thistle is the symbol of the Scottish Crown.)
However, this affectation is attributed to the Belgians, who developed a
fondness for this style of beer after Scottish soldiers stationed in Belgium
during World War I brought their strong Scottish Ale with them.
306
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

 Tulip: Tulip-shaped glasses are very effective in capturing the aromatic
qualities of beer. The tulip glass also closely resembles its name; these
glasses often have a flared opening to enable the drinker to sip the beer
and the foam at the same time, creating a creamy mouthfeel. Many
drinkers favor tulip glasses for strong Belgian beers.
 Weizenbier glass: The Weizenbier is a tall, shapely, wide-rimmed glass
that holds at least 18 ounces. It’s ideal for holding a half liter of Wheat
beer (and the beer’s towering head).
So do you need to run out and buy a dozen different sets of beer glassware to
consume correctly? Not at all. Beer drinking should be enjoyable, and a great
part of that enjoyment is comfort. Choose a beer-glass style that’s comfort-
able to use, and enjoy using it — often. I recommend having a set of standard
16-ounce pint glasses on hand, as well as a set of more elegant tulip glasses to
show off your proud brews.
Dirty Deeds: Cleaning Beer Glassware
After you’ve made your choice in glassware, commit yourself to keeping 
the glasses clean. No matter which beer goes in which glass, one thing is for
sure — keeping your beer glassware absolutely free of dust, oily fingerprints,
lipstick, and soapy residue is crucial. All these potential contaminants can
have a detrimental effect on the beer.
The phrase beer clean describes a particular level of cleanliness. This term
isn’t just lip service — beer glasses need to be spotlessly clean in order to
present the beer in its best light. The beer betrays any shortcomings in the
cleansing and rinsing practices.
Even though a glass looks clean, it may not be. As you’re rinsing, look at how
the water drains off the glass. If the water sheets off the glass, the glass is
beer clean; if the water breaks up, streaks, or spots, the glass is still dirty.
When pouring, check for bubbles that appear on the bottom or sides of the
glass below the head — these indicate invisible soap residue, grease, or dust.
(Cracks and chips also attract bubbles.) Soap residues and dust in a glass can
cause a beer to go flat quickly, and any fats or grease can break down and
destroy the surface of the head.
The most reliable way to check for a beer-clean glass is to pour a beer into
the glass, allowing a good head to form. After the beer stands for a few min-
utes, the head should remain firm and compact. If you didn’t properly clean
the glass, the foam breaks up, leaving large fish-eye bubbles.
Depending on your level of seriousness, you can clean beer glassware in a
number of ways. The best thing to do is to rinse your beer glasses thoroughly
in hot water right after you use them. This task may seem a bit compulsive,
307
Chapter 22: Storing and Pouring

but it’s very effective at keeping your glasses residue-free. Some drinkers are
so averse to cleaning their beer glasses in soapy water that a hot-water rinse
is as far as they want to go.
Check out both sides to this argument: One camp says that household dish-
washing soaps are scented and can be hard to rinse off. The other camp (the
one I belong to) says that if you use very small amounts of unscented dish-
washing liquids and follow up immediately with a hot water rinse, you don’t
do any damage.
I can give you a better (and more compulsive) way to clean your glasses.
Draw a sink full of hot water and add a couple of heaping tablespoons of
baking soda. Use a clean dishcloth to reach the deepest recesses of the glass.
Pay particular attention to the rim, making sure that you remove any lipstick
or lip balm. The dishwasher itself can’t do a better job.
Finally, be wary of running your glasses through the dishwasher. Food parti-
cles don’t always rinse and drain out of the dishwasher after each cycle, and
they could end up in your beer. Regardless of how you choose to clean your
glasses, always follow with a good hot rinse and then air-dry them in a dish
drainer.
Never towel-dry beer glasses. The towel can leave traces of soap, body oil,
and especially lint on the glasses.
At the professional or commercial level, where governmental regulations
apply, health departments require chemical sanitizers or sterilizers, including
products made with trisodium phosphate (TSP). Commercial establishments
generally use a glass-cleaning compound that’s odorless, sudsless, non-fat
based, and free-rinsing.
Storing Your Steins
The storing of your glassware is just as important as its cleaning. A poor 
storage location can make your cleaning efforts all for naught. Make sure you
store air-dried glasses away from unpleasant odors, grease, or smoke coming
from restrooms, kitchens, or ashtrays. If possible, store the glasses upside
down in a breakfront, credenza, or similar, relatively dust-free environment.
Don’t store glassware in the freezer. The glasses can pick up odors from 
food in the freezer, and frozen glasses are uncomfortable to hold. (They also
leave a nasty water ring wherever you set them down.) Your homebrew
deserves better.

D
rinking beer shouldn’t be a one-dimensional experience, although it can
be if you let it. Consuming beer or wine (or even food, for that matter) 
is an activity that you need to approach as a full-sensory experience. The
more of your senses you involve, the more you remember of the experience
(positive or otherwise).
If you cook a barbecued steak for dinner, you don’t just see the meat cooking
on the grill; you also hear the sizzling of its juices, and you smell its tantaliz-
ing aromas wafting through the air. As you taste the steak, you not only savor
the flavor, but you also describe the steak in a tactile manner — saying that
it’s moist and tender or dry and tough as leather (especially if you eat at 
my house).
Now transfer these mental notes to tasting beer. This chapter tells you how.
Because of all the senses and nuances involved in evaluating beer, a special
beer lingo has evolved to help describe the entire beer experience. (Notice
that I didn’t say beer-drinking experience — the beer experience involves
more than simply tasting!) I cover these special kinds of words later in this
chapter.
Tuning In to Your Beer
As you pour a beer into a glass, listen to the splashing of the liquid and the
fizzing of the escaping carbonation. See the fine bubbles race upward
through the liquid, only to get lost in a blanket of dense foam. Watch the head

rise and swell up over the lip of the glass. Breathe in the full bouquet of
aromas emanating from the beer. Taste the many flavors of the malt, hops,
and other ingredients. Feel the viscosity of the beer and the prickly efferves-
cence of the carbonation on your tongue and palate. Even after you swallow,
you can continue to discern the various flavors and textures of the 
departed beer.
When you find that you give each beer you drink this kind of attention, con-
gratulations are in order: You’ve made the first step in the painless transition
from plain old beer drinker to beer evaluator. This change in outlook means
that you’re tuning in to your beer; you’re no longer just drinking it — you’re
experiencing it. As a homebrewer, this experience is a useful tool. The more
you pay attention to the beers you drink, the better you become at picking up
different aromas, flavors, and sensations. Your finely tuned sensory organs
can then help you fine-tune your own homebrew.
Most beer drinkers find themselves simply enchanted by beer. Recognizing
and identifying the beer’s attributes helps you understand the basis for 
your enchantment. However, like most human objects of desire, beer can also
have some negative traits in addition to the good ones. Rating a friend or
lover according to a checklist is rather callous, but evaluating a beer by this
method is not only acceptable, I highly recommend it.
Evaluating One Sense at a Time
You want to get all or as many of your senses as possible involved in the 
beer experience. Your sight, naturally, is the first sense to transmit an image
of the beer to your brain. However, because the aromatics of the beer are
very volatile (meaning that they’re fleeting), you need to give your nose the
opportunity to register the olfactory data first. Your sense of smell can also
become desensitized as it becomes accustomed to the smell wafting from
your glass, so taking the opportunity to appreciate a beer’s fragrance at first
contact is very important. After you give your sense of smell its turn, you can
take a visual snapshot of the beer; follow this visual by taking in the taste and
aftertaste, and then take time for reflection. In correct order, the sequential
steps to experiencing beer are as follows:
1. Smell
2. Look
3. Taste
4. Aftertaste
5. Reflect
The following sections explore each of these experiences in more detail.
310
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

The nose knows
The fact that your nose is located above your mouth is no fluke of nature. 
A quick look anywhere in the animal kingdom confirms this statement. The
strategic location of the nose enables you to detect questionable odors 
emanating from potentially digestible items before you eat or drink them.
This nasal early-warning system safeguards man and beast alike from
unknowingly ingesting anything that may be detrimental to their health.
Nothing about beer should have you fearing for your health and well-being
(shameless overconsumption notwithstanding), but whether you need it as a
warning system or not, your ability to smell is of great importance as you
drink. A full third of your ability to taste is directly connected to the olfactory
functions. Even as you taste beer, you also smell it in the retronasal passage
at the back of the throat. Flavor relies on aroma, and the human nose can
detect thousands of aromas. Overlooking this fundamental aspect of the
beer-evaluation process would be negligent.
Alcoholic-beverage evaluators discuss the aromatic properties of their
respective drinks by using the word nose. Nose, appropriately enough, is also
the word they use to describe the total olfactory experience, which includes
aroma and bouquet. (To distinguish between these terms, think of aroma as 
if it were a sound and bouquet as the volume level or intensity of that sound.)
Beer connoisseurs also use the word nose interchangeably as a noun and
verb: “He nosed his beer studiously,” or “She commented on the beer’s 
pungent nose.”
So what kinds of aromas can you as beer evaluators expect to encounter?
You face both positives and negatives. The positives are those smells that
you expect to find in a correctly made beer of a particular style, and the 
negatives are odors that indicate flaws in the beer. Somewhere in between 
are the aromas that you don’t expect to find that don’t necessarily indicate
problems. These smells are aromas that don’t belong to the style of beer
you’re evaluating — they aren’t necessarily bad, but stylistically speaking,
they’re incorrect.
Each beer style comes with its own aroma and flavor profile; the following
sections offer only general parameters.
Positive aromas
Positive aromas result from the fermentation process and accentuate or
underline the main ingredients in the beer. The following list describes 
several of these aromas:
311
Chapter 23: You Can’t Judge a Bock by Its Cover: Evaluating Beer

 The first (and usually most obvious) aroma you encounter is the malt
character of the beer. This aroma can run from perfumy-sweet to rich
and caramelly, depending on the beer style. Ales tend toward fruity and
buttery (or butterscotchy) aromas that you can trace to warm fermenta-
tions and certain yeast strains. Depending on how dark the beer is,
roasty, toasty, or chocolatey aromas may also emanate from the 
specialty grains you added to the beer during brewing.
 The second most obvious aroma you may encounter is the hop character
of the beer. This aroma, of course, depends on hops: What variety and
quantity of hops the brewer used, when she added the hops to the boil-
ing beer, and whether she added aromatic hops to the beer during the
secondary fermentation phase. (See the discussion on dry hopping in
Chapter 11.) Common descriptors for these hop aromas are herbal,
spicy, grassy, floral, piney, citrusy, and occasionally cheesy (as well as
Sleepy, Grumpy, and Doc). You may very well get a whiff of the hops
even before you smell the malt — it all boils down to the individual beer
style and recipe.
 Positive aromas that directly result from the fermentation process may
include fruity esters, diacetyl (a buttery smell) in small quantities, and
nuttiness. You may even detect alcohol in the beer’s nose.
After you home in on the particular aromas in the beer, try to gauge their
intensities. Although lots of beer styles feature many of the same aromatics,
the different components vary in intensity.
Negative aromas
Negative aromas may include plastic-like and cooked–vegetable odors, rotten
eggs, skunkiness, paint-thinner, olives or pickles, and wet dog, among other
scents. (Makes ya kinda thirsty, doesn’t it?) I detail the possible causes of
each of the preceding aromas in Chapter 24.
You can inadvertently create negative aromas (and flavors) in any one of the
following four ways:
 You may have used flawed ingredients to make the beer. Stale hops or
moldy grain may inadvertently find their way into a brewpot now and
again. (As the brewer, you need to exercise strict quality control 
over your ingredients.)
 You may be guilty of procedural mistakes — for example, steeping the
grain at too high a temperature, oversparging the mash, or fermenting 
at too high a temperature.
 Wild fermentations by rogue bacteria or wild yeast may contaminate a
batch anytime between cool down of the wort and bottling (or kegging)
the beer.
312
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

 The way in which you store your bottled or kegged beer may affect the
beer’s aroma (as well as the length of time you age it). See Chapter 22 
for more on proper storage techniques.
Make sure you carefully follow all the directions in sanitizing, brewing, and
storing your beer to help ensure that your homebrew has positive aroma and
bouquet.
Seeing is beer-lieving
Sight is the most trusted sense you have. Experts in such matters say that
you base 75 percent of your perception of the world on sight; maybe that’s
why many beer drinkers fall into the trap of making hasty judgments of beer
based on what they see. In terms of beer evaluation, the eyes may not lie, but
they can only tell half-truths. A beer that looks dark, rich, strong, and roasty
may be just plain dark. And what can your eyes tell you about taste or smell?
Nothing — and that’s the point: Your eyes can tell you only about the beer’s
appearance, and nothing else.
What should you look for in a beer? You can discern three things about a 
particular beer by using your eyes:
 Color: The colors that make up the various styles run the spectrum from
pale straw to golden, amber, copper, orange, red, brown, and black —
and everything in between. No one color is necessarily better than the
other; each is the result of stylistic differences.
 Clarity: Many beer drinkers (Americans in particular) obsess over clear
beer. If their Old Frothy isn’t crystal clear, they refuse to drink it. With
homebrew, however, even perfectly aged and clarified beer may again
become cloudy if it’s not handled correctly; you don’t need to do much
to disturb the yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle.
Commercial beer is crystal clear only because of filtering equipment 
and techniques developed in the 19th century. Most brews throughout
history have been anywhere from hazy to murky. The source of this 
turbidity was the organic ingredients used in the beer-making process —
especially the yeast. The particulate matter that clouded the beer was
also what helped make the beer the nutritious drink that it was (and 
still is).
 Head retention: Head retention can tell a short story about the beer in
hand. All beers should be able to form and keep a head; the latter is as
important as the former. The head should form quickly and be very
tightly knit. The head may also take on a “rocky” appearance if sufficient
proteins (from the grain) are present. If a brew can’t form a proper head,
it may have any one of a number of problems. (See Chapter 24 for more
information on these problems.)
313
Chapter 23: You Can’t Judge a Bock by Its Cover: Evaluating Beer

In good taste
Here’s where I get down to the basics of beer consumption. Regardless of
how a beer looks and smells, if it doesn’t taste good, it hasn’t fulfilled its
obligation. Before delving into this subjective topic, take a closer look at the
primary tasting receptor in the human body: the tongue.
The four principal tastes that the tongue differentiates are salty, sour, sweet,
and bitter. As shown in Figure 23-1, the tongue has been mapped to show 
that the tip of the tongue is where the sweet receptors are predominately
located; the sides of the tongue are largely responsible for tasting sourness
and saltiness; and the very back of the tongue detects bitterness. Flavor
receptors are also located at the back and on the roof of the mouth, 
independent of the tongue.
Two tastes for the price of one
Beer tasting should be delineated between the first taste sensation experi-
enced by the tip of the tongue (foretaste) and the midtaste or true taste, in
which the beer displays its taste attractions completely. (The aftertaste I
address separately in the following section.) The foretaste and midtaste
should blend together mildly and harmoniously so as not to discourage fur-
ther drinking.
As is true of the aroma, the foretaste is of the sweet malt — this time, the
result of the tongue’s sweet-sensing region up front. With most adjunct-laden
brews (those made with a lot of rice or corn), the sweetness is delicate and

Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

perfumy and only vaguely tastes of true malt flavor, mainly because of the
lightening effect of the adjunct grain used. The fewer adjuncts you use, the
more the rich, caramelly maltiness of the barley shows through. (See Chapter
9 for more information on brewing with adjuncts.)
As you use more specialty grains in brewing — roasted ones in particular —
the beer’s flavor becomes more layered, or complex. With the exception of
crystal malt, these specialty grains rarely add sweetness — only the flavors
of the individual grain. These specialty malts create a mosaic of toasty,
roasty, nutty, toffee, and coffeelike flavors that meld into the finished brew. A
lot of these flavors register in the middle and at the back of the tongue. Some
of the more highly roasted malts add a dry, astringent taste that the tongue
perceives as being bitter, much like strong or stale coffee, or grape tannin in
wine. Certain beers may exhibit a slight tartness that you detect between the
midtaste and the aftertaste.
Normally, sour flavors constitute a flaw in beer, but in several Belgian beers
and at least one German beer, sourness is actually a prerequisite for the style.
For the sake of a general rule, certain Ales may have some sourness; Lagers,
however, definitely should not. Generally speaking, lactic sourness (which is
more of a mild tartness) is preferable over acetic sourness (which is vine-
gary) unless you specifically intend the latter.
Hops can make their taste presence known in one of two ways: Hop flavor or
hop bitterness. (The terms are mutually exclusive.) Hop flavor is distinctive
and usually tastes a lot like its aroma — grassy, piney, floral, citrusy, herbal,
cheesy, and so on; you normally experience it at midtaste. Hop bitterness, on
the other hand, is rather one-dimensional; you mostly experience it at the
back of the tongue and in the aftertaste.
Some of the positive flavors that you can attribute to fermentation include
fruitiness, diacetyl (buttery, butterscotchy), and alcohol. The fruity and 
buttery character you usually find only in Ales or warm-fermented beers.
Brewers usually consider Lagers that exhibit these traits to be incorrectly 
fermented and out of character. You should find an obvious alcohol taste only
in beers that have concentrations higher than 7 or 8 percent by volume.
On the negative side of the ledger is a long list of unpleasant flavors that 
you may experience. From the harsh astringency of boiled grain to the 
rubbery taste of autolyzed yeast, brewers and beer drinkers alike need to be
on the lookout for these palate-destroyers. Other defective flavors include
cidery aldehydes, medicinal phenolics, bloody metallics, “poopy” enterics,
and dozens of equally unappetizing tastes. (See the section “Relaying the
Results: Homebrew Lingo, Jargon, and Vernacular” later in this chapter.)
After you home in on the various flavors, try to gauge their intensity. Most
beer styles share common flavors, but the intensity of each fluctuates
according to style.
315
Chapter 23: You Can’t Judge a Bock by Its Cover: Evaluating Beer

Aftertaste can be a good thing!
The aftertaste, also called the finish, is one of the most important and enjoy-
able aspects of the beer-drinking experience, one that chiefly affects the 
decision whether to take another drink. American commercial beer drinkers
have been brainwashed into believing that beer is not supposed to have an
aftertaste and that beers that do are bad. What a shame! Imagine dining on
succulent (and expensive) Maine lobster tail dipped in pure, drawn butter,
only to have the flavor disappear from your mouth the second you swallow.
That flavor memory is what aftertaste is all about.
Many facets of the beer (including its faults) become more obvious in the
aftertaste. The aftertaste is where you want to evaluate the various taste
components of the beer, especially their harmony and balance.
Certain beer styles strive to accentuate malt over hops and vice versa, but 
no one ingredient should completely dominate the other.
The aftertaste is a good time to assess the body and tactile quality of the
beer. In beverage evaluation, body refers to the weighty feel or thickness of a
product. A light beer you describe as light-bodied; an India Pale Ale you may
describe as medium-bodied; and a Doppelbock you describe as full-bodied.
Other, more colorful descriptors, such as wimpy, thin, voluptuous, massive,
and robust are more effective at getting the point across.
The tactile aspect of beverage evaluation is mouthfeel. You don’t want to con-
fuse taste and mouthfeel with one another — taste you interpret by way of
the taste buds, and mouthfeel is the sensory experience of the whole inside 
of the mouth and throat. (That is, you don’t taste cold; you feel it.) A light
Lager beer you may describe as effervescent and watery, and a Stout you
may describe as soft and chewy.
Astringency runs a fine line between taste and mouthfeel — and between
hops and grain, for that matter. Astringency is like the mouthfeel of a grape
skin (recognized as tannin in wine) or of strong tea. Hops contribute bitter-
ness to the beer. Grain can also contribute its own bitterness in the form of
astringents. This astringency straddles the fence between the “husky” flavor
of the grain and a harsh, dry, or powdery mouthfeel. Very often, people who
experience grain astringency wrongly attribute that experience to the hops.
The key to distinguishing between hop bitterness and grain astringency is
two-sided: You usually experience hop bittering farther back on the tongue,
and grain astringency tends to affect the roof of the mouth (the soft palate)
more than hop bitterness does.
You also experience alcohol most keenly in the aftertaste, not just in terms 
of flavor but in its warming sensation in the throat. This sensation can run
from searing heat to menthol-like cooling. As is the case with brandy or
cognac, the alcohol sensation is one of the understated pleasures of a 
high-octane brew.
316
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

From Observations to Reflections
The reflection is essentially your overall impression of the beer. The differ-
ence here is that you made (or should have made) all the previous assess-
ments objectively. Reflection is the time to take into account all those
objective observations and then form a subjective opinion about the beer.
Here’s where you do your accounting and weigh all the checks and balances.
If you’re judging the beer according to a particular beer style, you need to
evaluate it according to style guidelines rather than by personal preferences.
If, however, you’re judging strictly by matter of personal taste, you can
simply go with a thumbs up or a thumbs down.
Here, again, the budding homebrewer faces another choice: objective versus
subjective analysis. Not a difficult choice, not a life-changing one, but one to
challenge your enthusiasm and your commitment to increasing your brewing
expertise. Are you satisfied with the back-patting of your beer-guzzling bud-
dies, or are you interested in getting legitimate and unbiased feedback on
your brews? If you are, I suggest that you check out Chapter 25 for the low-
down on homebrew competitions.
Relaying the Results: Homebrew 
Lingo, Jargon, and Vernacular
If you’re like most other homebrewers, after you’re comfortably estab-
lished in your new hobby you want to seek out and interact with your fellow
enthusiasts — those who share your passion for brewing. The exchange of
information on any specific subject generally requires a common language,
and, just your luck, beer evaluation also has such a language. This little-
known patois is absolutely necessary for professionals within the industry
as a quality-control vocabulary, as well as for professionals outside the
industry who evaluate brewers’ products. Homebrewers also have a vested
interest in this language.
One of the best illustrations of the beer vocabulary is the internationally rec-
ognized Beer Flavor Wheel developed by a gent named Dr. Morton Meilgaard,
who headed up a group of technologists from the American Society of
Brewing Chemists. On Dr. Meilgaard’s wheel are 14 major categories covering
every aspect of beer evaluation (see Figure 23-2). Notice that, although you
can register taste in seven of these categories, you can register aroma in 12 of
them; the only two categories that your nose can’t detect are salty and bitter.
317
Chapter 23: You Can’t Judge a Bock by Its Cover: Evaluating Beer

These 14 categories further break down into 44 first-tier terms (terms such as
bitter, salty, and fruity). Not listed here (for reasons of simplicity) are more
than 80 second-tier terms and hundreds of comments, synonyms, and defini-
tions that provide an in-depth (read: professional) understanding of correct
beer evaluations.
Notice that some of the descriptors for aroma and flavor can be considered
both good and bad — these run according to stylistic parameters. Musty
aromas and flavors, for example, are acceptable in some bottle-conditioned
Ales but are wholly inappropriate for a German Lager.

Troubleshooting
In This Chapter
 Fixing your fermentation
 Solving flavoring problems
 Correcting aroma woes
 Resolving appearance issues
Just as everyone is a beginner once, everyone is also likely to make a 
mistake at least once. Making mistakes is actually an inevitable part of the
homebrewing process; the key is to figure out what the problem is and then
not repeat it. Identifying these goof-ups is the first step on the road to both
quality and consistency in homebrewing.
Occasionally, adverse things happen to homebrewed beer that are difficult 
to understand and even more difficult to describe; the purpose of this 
chapter is to help you troubleshoot — in standard homebrew lingo — any
problems that may occur during your homebrewing adventures. You may
even want to read this chapter prior to brewing a batch just to reacquaint
yourself with the many pitfalls of homebrewing as well as ready yourself with
an appropriate reaction to any problem that may arise.
Fermentation Lamentations
Like naive and optimistic young parents, homebrewers sometimes have unre-
alistic visions of how perfect everything will be and often take for granted
that things will happen exactly as expected. One good example is adding
yeast to sweet, sugary wort. Many brewers assume the yeast hungrily 
consumes whatever they feed it, finishes eating at an appropriate time, and 
then takes its scheduled nap. Then reality strikes. Reality, in this case, is 
represented by the following list of fermentation problems.
Fermentation problems occur quite frequently — sometimes your fermenta-
tion gets off to a slow start, and sometimes it never wants to stop. The 
following sections describe what you should do if you ever face one of these
situations.

No fermentation
Your fermentation never started? First, make sure it actually hasn’t. Judging
fermentation by the bubbles (or lack thereof) coming out of the airlock can
sometimes be deceiving. Look at the beer (if it’s in a glass fermenter) or peek
through the airlock hole in the lid (if it’s in a plastic fermenter). Do you see
any foam or a ring of brownish scum around the fermenter? If so, the beer is
fermenting or has fermented. Use your hydrometer to check the gravity. The
beer is typically done fermenting if the final gravity is 1⁄3 to 1⁄4 of the original
gravity. For example: A 1.045 beer ferments down to 1.015 to 1.012 or below. 
If after 24 to 48 hours fermentation has truly not begun — or you’re just 
not sure — try adding more yeast.
Situations like this one give you good reason to keep a packet of dry yeast in
the fridge for emergencies.
Be mindful of sanitary practices; how or when the beer ferments doesn’t
mean a thing if you contaminate the whole batch in the process. (See Chapter
3 for more advice on sanitation.)
If fermentation still hasn’t begun after you add more yeast, you may have
made one of the following mistakes:
 You didn’t rinse the sanitizer from the fermenter. Sanitizer residue can
kill yeast, too.
 You put the fermenter in a place that’s too cold. Leave it at 64 to 72
degrees Fahrenheit for Ales.
 You used old or dead yeast. The yeast contained in ingredient kits is
often so old that it’s useless — always buy fresh yeast that has been
kept refrigerated.
 You rehydrated the yeast improperly by using water that was too hot
(more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit). Also, don’t leave the yeast in the
rehydration water too long; 30 minutes is plenty.
 You used good yeast but shocked it with sudden changes in tempera-
ture or by adding it to wort that was too cold (under 70 degrees
Fahrenheit) or too hot (over 110 degrees Fahrenheit).
 You didn’t use enough yeast. Pitch 10 to 15 grams of dry yeast, or use 1
package of ready-to-pitch liquid yeast per 5 gallons of beer. (See Chapter
6 for more information on RTP yeast.)
Slow-starting or stuck fermentations usually mean under-pitching of yeast,
underaerated wort, or both. To correct these problems in the future, pitch a
larger volume of yeast and make sure you properly aerate the wort before
pitching.
320
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

High-gravity worts (those with a specific gravity of 1.056 or higher) need even
more yeast and aeration for proper fermentation.
Stuck fermentation
What if the fermentation started well but seems to have become stuck?
Again, looks can be deceiving — use your hydrometer to find out whether
your fermentation is actually stuck or simply finished! Remember that you
want the final hydrometer reading to be 1⁄3 to 1⁄4 of the original gravity.
If the gravity is below 1.020, your brew has probably fermented out as much
as it’s going to. Some recipes contain lots of unfermentable sugars.
If the fermentation is truly stuck and the wort still has a high gravity reading,
do one (or more) of the following to help restart the fermentation process:
 Add more fresh yeast or a different strain of yeast.
 Try to rouse the yeast with a sanitized spoon. Mix the yeast off the
bottom to wake it up and get it to start fermenting again.
 If all else fails, bottle or keg the beer (kegging being the safer of the
two options). If you’re bottling the beer, cut back the priming sugar to
less than 1⁄2 cup to reduce the chance of exploding bottles. Chapters 13
and 14 have more information about bottling and kegging.
If the batch’s alcohol level is above 7 percent, the yeast may have reached its
limit for alcohol tolerance. Try adding a yeast with higher alcohol tolerance,
like champagne yeast. (Champagne yeast also ferments cleanly, with no off
flavors.)
Never-ending fermentation
If you have a beer that has been fermenting in the primary fermenter for
more than 14 days, consider these possibilities:
 Is the temperature too low? (60 degrees Fahrenheit for Ales and 40
degrees Fahrenheit for Lagers may be too low.) Ale yeast works very
slowly at these temperatures (if at all); try warming the beer up to get it
to finish fermenting.
 Are you making a Lager? Lagers typically take 10 to 14 days to ferment
at proper temperatures (see the preceding bullet).
321
Chapter 24: Troubleshooting

 Do you have a wild yeast contamination? Rogue yeasts are capable of
fermenting sugars that pure beer yeast can’t, so fermentation can
appear to go on forever. If your beer actively ferments for over 3 weeks,
it’s probably contaminated, and your brew may be doomed. Smell and
taste the beer and decide for yourself whether to keep it or toss it.
 Did you rack into your secondary fermenter too soon? If you’re using a
two-stage fermentation system, you may have racked the beer into the
secondary fermenter too early. Never rack beer until vigorous fermenta-
tion is done (which usually takes a minimum of 5 days). By racking to a
secondary vessel too early, you remove the beer from most of the yeast.
What little yeast is left has to carry on the rest of the fermentation
duties. Racking later is generally better than racking sooner. Try adding
more yeast. See Chapter 11 for more on secondary fermentation.
In Bad Taste: Off Flavors and Aromas
Flavor is a complex combination of smell and taste. Sometimes, it can be diffi-
cult to tell whether the strange character of your beer is due to something you
taste or smell. Pinpointing these flavors is the first step to fixing problems in
your brew.
In the following sections, I give you a rundown of some common flavor 
and aroma defects, with possible causes and remedies (and Chapter 23
includes more evaluative information). Also check out the quick-reference
troubleshooting tables at the end of this section.
Butter/butterscotch flavors
Buttery or butterscotchy flavors indicate the presence of a compound called
diacetyl. Diacetyl occurs naturally in most warm fermentations but also 
dissipates naturally throughout the course of a proper fermentation cycle.
Very obvious diacetyl flavor may indicate other problems, such as extremely
warm fermentation temperatures, unhealthy yeast, underoxygenated wort, 
or bacterial contamination.
Homebrewers can reduce diacetyl levels in their beer by allowing a diacetyl
rest at the end of primary fermentation. Yeast can reduce diacetyl levels in
beer; the key is to not rack the beer over to a secondary fermenter for 2 to 3
days after initial fermentation has subsided to allow the yeast time to rid the
beer of the diacetyl.
Many beer styles in the Ale family — especially those from Britain — can
exhibit noticeable diacetyl flavors. The presence of diacetyl in any Lager
beer, however, indicates a flaw.
322
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

It’s sometimes difficult to distinguish between the caramelly flavors created
by caramel malts (caramel is made by heating butter and sugar) and the 
buttery flavor derived from diacetyl. Novice judges beware!
Sour/tart flavors
Sourness in the average beer is usually a sure sign of a bacterial contamina-
tion. These bacteria can produce lactic acid or acetic acid (found in vinegar),
and these acids can range from the mild tartness of grapefruit to the mouth-
puckering tanginess of lemons.
The bacteria that creates lactic acid is lactobacillus, and the bacteria that cre-
ates acetic acid is acetobacter.
You can easily prevent beer spoilage by increasing your cleaning and sanitiz-
ing efforts. Be especially suspicious of any scratched plastic equipment that
may be harboring bacteria; you may need to replace that equipment. Also, be
careful when handling grain around sanitized equipment — grain dust har-
bors bacteria that can travel airborne for long distances. All bacteria tend to
multiply faster than yeast; this speed means if bacteria are present in your
yeast cultures, they can increase dramatically every time you repitch the
yeast. In this case, replace your yeast culture.
In many beer styles — mostly Belgian styles — sour flavors aren’t only
acceptable, they’re expected. Even the most famous stout in the world
(Guinness) undergoes a mild lactic fermentation (brewers sour a small por-
tion of the beer and then blend it back into the rest of the batch).
Medicinal/plastic/smoky flavors
These flavors comprise part of a class of compounds called phenols. Phenolic
flavors can come from wild yeast. The best cure is to improve your sanitation
procedures and/or to replace your yeast culture.
Before knocking yourself out trying to eliminate all phenolic flavors, be aware
that some beer styles actually include phenolics as part of their taste and
aromatic profiles. These styles include Bavarian Weizenbier, some Belgian
Ales, and most Smoked beers.
Chlorine can also give rise to these flavors, forming what are called
chlorophenols. Always use dechlorinated water (preboiled or carbon-filtered),
and be sure that you thoroughly rinse any bleach off of your equipment after
sanitizing.
323
Chapter 24: Troubleshooting

Papery/cardboard/sherry-like 
flavors (oxidation)
It’s important not to aerate finished beer during the bottling process, and 
oxidation is why. (See Chapter 13 for bottling procedures.) Oxygen in finished
beer is where these flavors come from. Remember the following:
 Be careful when siphoning. To avoid splashing or foaming, stir priming
solution very carefully.
 Don’t aerate hot wort, either. The oxygen comes back to haunt you
later. (Aerate cooled wort only at pitching time.)
 If you keg, use CO2 to purge all vessels of oxygen.
 If you top-up fermenters with water, use boiled and cooled water. This
process removes oxygen from the water.
 Fill bottles to the highest reasonable level. This process minimizes air
contact with the beer. Shoot for 1 inch from the bottle opening.
Oxygen-absorbing caps are available for bottles if you want to pay the higher
cost. For all the good that these caps do, they aren’t a cure for sloppy
beer/wort handling.
Dry/puckering mouthfeel (astringency)
Sometimes, you may experience a dry, puckering sensation (similar to chew-
ing on a grape skin) in your beer’s finish; you typically feel this on the back
sides of the tongue and on the back of the roof of your mouth. This astrin-
gency is caused by compounds called tannins.
The most common cause of astringency is improper handling of grains (see
bulleted list below). If you’re not careful, tannins can be extracted from the
grains and washed into the wort.
The following steps can help you keep the tannin extraction from malt husks
to a minimum:
 When milling malt, don’t overcrack the grain. Fine husk particles can
easily get into the wort.
 Don’t oversparge grains. By the time you extract the last bit of sugar,
you’ve also extracted a good amount of tannins. Limit sparging to 2
quarts of water per pound of grain.
324
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

 Don’t use sparge water over 168 degrees Fahrenheit. Exceeding this
temperature extracts tannins in large quantities.
 Try to acidify your sparge water (less than 7.0 pH). Alkaline pH
(greater than 7.0) can also extract tannins from grains. You can also add
gypsum to the sparge water to keep the mash pH and wort pH low. (The
best pH for sparge water is between 5.0 and 6.0.)
Harshness/hotness
Occasionally, a beer may taste harsh or have a mouthfeel that’s best
described as hot. Many factors can cause a harsh tasting beer.
 Excessive hopping rates can create a bitter harshness in your beer.
 Beers made with hard or chalky water can taste harsh. See Chapter 7
for more on dealing with hard water.
 High fermentation temperatures can produce fusel alcohol, which
creates a hot, solvent-like sensation. Try not to exceed a fermentation
temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Overcarbonated beers can have an unpleasant, prickly harshness on
the palate. Contaminated and overprimed beers are usually excessively
carbonated.
Metallic flavor
Sometimes a metallic taste in your brew is the result of oxidation, but you
can typically trace it back to iron utensils or equipment. Try to use copper or
stainless-steel vessels for boiling. If you use enamelware pots, make sure that
the ceramic surfaces aren’t chipped. Also, if you can taste iron in your water,
you can taste it in your beer. If this is the case, you need to consider buying
your brewing water bottled.
Skunk aroma
Skunky smelling beer is the unfortunate result of storing beer in direct light
for extended periods of time. Sunlight has the most detrimental effect, but
fluorescent and incandescent light can also destroy beer aroma. Beer that
smells skunky is referred to as light-struck.

Chapter 24: Troubleshooting

Sulfury odors
Certain sulfury (hydrogen sulfide) odors can emanate from yeast and can
smell like rotten eggs, burned matches, rubber, and so on. The source is 
usually yeast that’s breaking down (a process called autolysis). The key to
keeping these odors from occurring is to rack your beer promptly after pri-
mary fermentation. Certain Lager yeasts also naturally produce these odors;
changing yeast strains or (in the case of Lagers) proper aging can sometimes
correct the problem.
Vegetal flavors and aromas
Occasionally, you may taste or smell a cornlike character in your beer. This
quality comes from a compound called dimethyl sulfide or DMS.
DMS comes from the malt or, more specifically, the heating or boiling of the
wort. Pale malts also produce more DMS than darker malts. Typically, DMS is
driven off in the steam of the boil, but after you turn the heat off, DMS can
still creep up in the wort. If you cool your wort too slowly, you trap large
quantities of DMS in the beer. So the best preventative measure is to cool
your wort as quickly as possible to keep DMS at a minimum.
One important point is that some DMS is part of the flavor profile of Lager
beers due to the fact that Lager malts produce larger amounts of DMS.
Although you can expect some DMS in Lagers, you certainly don’t need to
purposely create it. If you use Lager malts, you still have plenty of DMS in
your beer.
Certain bacteria also create DMS. When this happens, very large amounts of
DMS are typically present. These bacteria can also produce other flavors and
odors that are reminiscent of vegetables, such as cooked cauliflower and
broccoli. To minimize these off flavors, cool the wort and pitch the yeast as
soon as possible.

Conditioning and Appearance Problems
Once your beer is done fermenting, you need to condition it. Conditioning is
an added aging process during which the beer is naturally clarified and recar-
bonated. As simple as the process seems, things don’t always work out the
329
Chapter 24: Troubleshooting

way they should. The appearance of your beer may mean a lot to you, and
color and clarity can influence how drinkers perceive it. This section
addresses problems that may occur with the conditioning and appearance 
of your brew.
Flat out of gas
What if your beer is flat? If you can still feel the CO2 bubbles on your tongue,
but the beer just isn’t holding a head, your beer isn’t the problem — the dirty
glass is. See Chapter 22 for more on proper glass-cleaning techniques.
If you can’t even feel the carbonation, check these potential problems:
 Did you age the beer enough? Typically, your beer needs at least 
2 weeks to carbonate properly in the bottle. Lagers take even longer
because of the cold storage. After you bottle your beer, be sure to 
keep the bottles at 66 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 weeks for proper
conditioning. Don’t store your beer cold until after this conditioning
period is over.
 Did you prime the beer with the proper amount of corn sugar? Always
use 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 cup of corn sugar per 5 gallons of beer (but never more). 
And be sure that you thoroughly mix the priming sugar solution into the
wort — pour the dextrose and water mixture into the bottling bucket
before you drain the beer into it.
 Did you thoroughly rinse your equipment? Make sure you rinse all the
equipment of sanitizer residue. Any residue can shock or kill the yeast
necessary to carbonate the beer.
 Did you tightly seal your bottles? Prior to bottling, check all your 
bottles and caps for cracks, chips, or imperfections. These flaws let CO2
escape from the bottles. Improperly seated caps can also be the culprit.
Thar she blows! Overcarbonated beers
Got beer that foams and gushes? Again, check the priming rate. (See Chapter
13 for more on priming.) Also, be sure that your beer has fully fermented
before you bottle it. Any residual unfermented sugar left in the beer causes
your brew to become overcarbonated.
Another cause of overcarbonation can be contamination. Certain wild yeasts
and bacteria consume sugars that beer yeast can’t. This occurrence produces
copious amounts of CO2. The excess carbonation comes out of solution
quickly and produces gushing. Remember to sanitize bottles, caps, and so on,
and always boil your priming solutions.
330
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

In a haze: Cloudy beers
The average beer drinker is accustomed to crystal-clear, filtered beers. If
your beer tastes good but has a haze, don’t worry about it — most of the
time the haze does not affect the flavor. Some beers, like unfiltered wheat
beers, are cloudy by nature.
Eventually, most haze (especially yeast) settles out if given enough time.
However, if you really need clear beer, you can try some clarifying products.
Check out Chapter 9 to find out more about clarifying and fining agents.
Chill haze is a phenomenon caused by chilling your beer. A clear beer at
room temperature becomes hazy when refrigerated. The haze doesn’t affect
the flavor and eventually settles out on its own. The beer also clears up if you
allow it to warm up again.
Like anything else, fining agents have their drawbacks. Any time you remove
something you want to get rid of (yeast, haze), you can also inadvertently
remove something you don’t want to get rid of (body, head retention). Be
careful about improper use or overuse of finings.
Poor head, bad body
Do you need better body and head retention in your beers? Proteins in 
your beer are responsible for a great body and a head to go with it (and 
who doesn’t want that?). If you don’t use any grains in your beer, you need
to. Incorporating 1⁄2 to 1 pound of crystal malt or CaraPils malt (per 5-gallon
batch) into your wort helps. (See Chapter 4 for more information about
malts.) Adding flavorless malto-dextin powder to your wort also works like 
a charm (use 4 to 8 ounces per 5 gallons).

Chapter 25
Homebrew Competitions
In This Chapter
 Entering homebrew competitions
 Becoming a beer judge
Just as amateur chefs and bakers compete in chili cook-offs and pie 
bake-offs, homebrew competitions provide a competitive platform for
people who like to make beer. Back in 1985, a dozen such competitions 
may have been held across the country, attracting a couple hundred entries;
now a couple hundred competitions attract thousands of entries every year.
These competitions are held at the local, regional, and national level and
offer awards of varying sizes to the winners.
Because homebrew competitions now have so much at stake, the American
Homebrewers Association (AHA) in Boulder, Colorado, in conjunction with
the Home Wine and Beer Trade Association (HWBTA), saw the need to 
establish a Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) to standardize judging
and scoring procedures. (For more information regarding the BJCP and how
to become a beer judge, check out the section “Becoming a Barrister of 
Beer” later in this chapter.) After establishing the BJCP, the AHA created a
sanctioning program that guaranteed uniform rules and operations at all 
AHA sanctioned events.
Today, the homebrewing community considers any competition that doesn’t
request and receive an AHA sanction a maverick event. Neither judges nor
contestants are quick to participate in nonconformist events — judges
because they don’t earn BJCP judging points, and contestants because they
aren’t guaranteed a respectable level of competency from the judges. In this
chapter, I give you the lowdown on AHA-sanctioned beer competitions,
including how they’re run and how you can enter. If simply entering isn’t
enough involvement for you, I also cover how you can become a beer judge.

What’s Involved in Homebrewing
Competitions?
The general format for an AHA-sanctioned event goes something like this:
The event’s sponsor picks a calendar date far in advance of the competition,
both for positioning purposes (so that it doesn’t coincide with any other
competitions) and for advertising purposes (to enable homebrewers to plan
their entries ahead of time and to make sure that enough judges can attend).
A homebrew club (or several clubs together) usually sponsors the event, 
but retail stores — and especially homebrew shops — may also sponsor such
an event. The sponsor must also reserve a location at which to hold the 
competition and actively solicit donations toward prizes.
Closer to the day of the event, the sponsor contacts qualified judges and
coaxes and cajoles them into attending. (Judges rarely receive any compen-
sation for their participation.) Meanwhile, word of the event spreads to
potential competitors via popular press, direct mail, Internet postings, and
word-of-mouth. Customarily, all competitors must submit their entries at
least one week in advance of the event so that the beer has time to settle 
and the competition committee can correctly register all entries. After the
committee logs in the brews by beer style and category, they store the
entries in cool conditions until the event.
The typical AHA-sanctioned event may have as many as 28 major classifica-
tions and another 50 subcategories open to entries. The major classifications
include beer, Cider, Mead, and even sake. If the competition committee doesn’t
receive enough entries to fill a certain category, it pairs those entries with
other, similar categories and instructs the judges to judge them separately
according to style — for example, the judges would judge German-Style
Pilseners and Bohemian-Style Pilseners together in the same grouping but 
differently according to their individual style.
How are the entries judged?
On the day of the event — or the first day, in the case of larger, multi-day
competitions — the sponsor readies the location, assembles the panel of
judges, and hands out judging assignments. Stewards — people who help the
competition run smoothly (often beer judge trainees) — make sure that all
judges have the correct judging forms and score sheets, appropriate writing
implements, drinking water, and something to cleanse the palate between
beers (usually French bread or unsalted crackers).
334
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

The standard AHA scoring format uses a 50-point system. The aroma scores 0
to 12 points; the appearance, 0 to 3; the flavor, 0 to 20; the body, 0 to 5; and
the overall impression, 0 to 10. The score sheet also addresses beer quality
according to “Stylistic Accuracy, Technical Merit, and Intangibles.” with
check boxes (but no extra points)
At a sanctioned event, a common practice is to have all the participating
judges evaluate a calibration beer as a way of tuning up their palates before
moving on to the actual competition beers. Every judge gets a sample of the
same calibration beer, usually a commercially made product. After all the
judges evaluate the calibration beer (according to its style), they turn in 
their score sheets. The competition director tabulates the judges’ scores,
announces the average score, and reminds judges who scored higher or
lower than the average to calibrate themselves up or down to achieve 
balanced scores with the other judges.
The competition committee pairs the event’s judges according to their stylis-
tic preferences and/or level of knowledge. (If a judge has no experience with
Australian Aboriginal Ale, for example, that judge has no business judging
that category.) No fewer than two judges ever judge a brew together.
After tasting the brew and writing their remarks on the score sheet, the
judges usually discuss the beer’s attributes together. Although judges are at
liberty to disagree with one another on the finer points, their scores should
always reflect a shared opinion of the beer within a 5-point margin. (A huge
disparity in scores indicates a bias or fundamental lack of knowledge on the
part of one or both judges.) The brewers always receive these score sheets
shortly after the event.
In the name of fairness and objectivity, only the competition committee mem-
bers, who are responsible for registering and logging in the entries, know the
identities of the individual brewers. Judges aren’t privy to any information
that divulges the brewers’ identities.
After all the beer categories are judged and the score sheets tabulated, 
the best beer from each category goes on to the Best-of-Show round. The
competition committee hand-picks the most senior and experienced judges
(from a pool of those who don’t have a brew competing for the Best of 
Show) to adjudicate the beers at this level. Judges use no score sheets; they
choose the two or three beers that best represent their respective categories
by process of elimination. The final three beers left standing receive first-,
second-, and third-place honors, based on the judges’ evaluations. (Some
competitions choose up to four or five Best-of-Show beers.)
The prizes at homebrewing competitions nowadays are nothing to sneeze 
at. Generally speaking, the larger the competition is, the more valuable the
prizes are. The national competitions, especially the one hosted by the AHA,
are exceptionally generous, thanks to the donations that large breweries 
and allied businesses worldwide make.
335
Chapter 25: Homebrew Competitions

How do I enter a homebrew competition,
and what are the rules?
To enter a homebrew competition, you first need to find out where and when
the competitions take place. You can find this information at various loca-
tions on the Internet. The standard eligibility requirement is simple: The beer
must be genuine homebrewed beer made in the home. Beyond this standard
rule, individual competitions may set the entry requirements and rules and
regulations, including those described in the following list:
 Competition entry fee: The entry fee is a nominal amount to help defray
the costs of hosting competitions. In addition to prizes (which may or
may not be donations), competition committees must find a location for
the event, which often comes at a price; they must provide food for the
judges and stewards (who don’t receive payment for their services); 
and they must cover the costs for mailings in advance of the event and
again for mailings of score sheets and prizes after the event. Entry fees
generally run from $5 per entry up to $15 per entry, depending on the
event. Most events also give price breaks to brewers who submit more
than, say, four or five entries.
 Bottle size limits: These limits are to keep all entries somewhat uniform.
Typical bottle size requirements are from 12 to 16 ounces (in green or
brown glass). If sponsors didn’t impose limits on submission size, stor-
age or refrigeration problems could result. Unusually sized or odd-
shaped bottles can also compromise brewer anonymity.
 Number of bottles per entry: Most competitions require two or three
bottles per entry and for a good reason: One bottle is for the first round
of judging; if a particular beer takes first place in its category, it moves
on to the Best-of-Show round, at which point the judges sample a fresh
bottle. A third bottle is to cover for any breakage that may occur in 
shipping and handling. If no breakage occurs, the leftover beer becomes
the well-earned property of the host club. (Now that’s some incentive to
sponsor a competition!)
 Category and classification: The AHA keeps a composite listing of some
20-odd major beer styles and their taste profiles, along with a multitude
of lesser substyles. (See the recipe chapters in this book for more on
these profiles.) These standards are respected throughout the home-
brewing community. All AHA-sanctioned events use AHA beer style
guidelines for judging purposes, but each event reserves the right to
pick and choose which categories to judge at each event — make sure
that you read the competition category rules carefully.
336
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 

 Entry deadline: As I mention in the section “What’s Involved in
Homebrewing Competitions?” earlier in this chapter, the customary
deadline is one week before the competition to give participants time 
for registration and cataloging, as well as to provide time for the beer to
settle. Each competition committee, however, has the right to set a
deadline as it sees fit.
How do I send my beer?
Anyone familiar with the U.S. postal laws knows that sending alcoholic 
beverages through the mail is illegal. Some package shipping services, how-
ever, deliver homebrewed beer to a designated location “for analysis only.”
(Like the U.S. Postal Service, these companies also make international deliv-
eries.) Only once in many years of shipping homebrew this way was I ever
questioned about the contents of my parcel or its purpose. Just make sure
you pack the bottles well, using wadded newspaper or Styrofoam packing
peanuts. Line the inside of the box with a plastic bag and place the bottles
and packing material inside the liner. Some competitions recommend 
double-boxing for extra protection.
Make sure that you fill out all the necessary forms and attach them to bottles,
where appropriate — and don’t forget to include the entry fee!
Many homebrewers who live close to the competition location drop off their
brews at the designated location and save themselves the shipping costs.
Becoming a Barrister of Beer
So you think you want to become a beer judge? You think that the job sounds
like an easy gig? You think you’d get to drink a lot of free beer? The answer to
the first question may be “Yes,” but the answer to the second two is “No!” —
conditionally speaking, of course. You do reach a point where the good
aspects of the job far outweigh the bad, but becoming a certified beer judge
is no cake walk. If you think you’re qualified just because you drink beer,
think again.
What it takes to become a beer judge
Becoming good at judging beer takes time, practice, experience, persever-
ance, and a genuine desire to excel at the task. The following list describes in
detail what developing these characteristics requires:
337
Chapter 25: Homebrew Competitions

 Time: No one becomes an expert at anything overnight. Just because
you’ve been drinking Old Foamy for years (since you were legally old
enough, of course) doesn’t qualify you for anything but a loyal-customer
award and a rebate coupon. You need to spend time taste-testing and
absorbing all the style parameters of various beers. The more you read,
taste, and practice, the quicker you develop the skills you need to be a
good beer judge. (Depending on your level of dedication, you can
achieve judgeship within a year.)
 Practice: Even good and experienced judges need to practice beer judg-
ing. You must put your evaluation skills to the test regularly to stay
sharp and in tune. You don’t need to practice just at actual competitions
either; regular evaluation of your own homebrews or store-bought beer
accomplishes the same goal.
 Experience: A good beer judge has a deep and profound knowledge of
beer styles and has personally tasted hundreds of different brands from
different countries and breweries in a quest for this experience. And
although you can conceivably become a beer judge without being a
homebrewer, you’d miss a fundamental part of what the game is all
about. Every certified beer judge I know is a homebrewer.
 Perseverance: Beer-judging opportunities don’t always come to you.
Some travel and a significant contribution of personal time are impera-
tive to progress within the system. No one pays you for this honor, and
no one reimburses you for your expenses.
 Genuine desire: If you can’t drink Barley Wine (a rich, thick, alcoholic
Ale) for three hours before lunch, if you can’t stomach beer from 9 a.m.
till 5 p.m., if you can’t handle tasting brews for two or maybe even three
days straight, you may want to take up stamp collecting instead of beer
judging. And by the way, you get no guarantees that everything you
judge is gonna taste good!
338
Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 
How’s my brewing?
Sending your homebrewed beer to a sanctioned
competition can be a very gratifying aspect of
homebrewing. Beyond winning nice ribbons and
prizes, however, competitions offer homebrew-
ers clear and objective evaluations of their beers
by competent and knowledgeable beer judges.
For each brew that you send to a sanctioned
competition, you’re guaranteed to receive all the
judges’ score sheets in return. These score
sheets go beyond assigning a simple numerical
score to your brew; because of their training,
BJCP judges offer intelligent and coherent feed-
back on your beer. Although some of what they
say about your brew may be guesswork, the
judges’ comments may also point out important
negative attributes in your beer and in your
brewing technique that may help you improve
not only your beer but also your enjoyment of
homebrewing. This information alone is often
worth the entry fee.

I can never forget one particular national competition during which a table of
judges had to evaluate a garlic beer. That stuff was so potent they had to
open the windows before judging could continue!
Your enthusiasm is undiminished? Your resolve unflagging? Good; you may
find a place in the Beer Judge Certification Program. And because this pro-
gram is the only one of its kind in the United States (with members in
Canada), you have no alternative choices if you really want to become a beer
judge. However, the Association of Brewers, parent organization of the
American Homebrewers Association, is currently sharing information with
brewing groups in Europe and Asia. It’s just a matter of time before countries
in these regions develop their own beer judging organizations.
At the time I became a beer judge in the spring of 1986, I was one of only 70
across the country and the first one in the state of Illinois. Today, over 2,000
judges from every state in the Union — and Canada — are in the BJCP.
Advancing to supreme quart justice
The BJC Program was established in 1985 to educate already-knowledgeable
people in correct procedural judging techniques and to standardize scoring
methods. After a judge candidate proves her knowledge and ability by pass-
ing an entrance exam at a certain level, she may progress through the pro-
gram by earning experience points for judging, stewarding, and organizing
competitions. The number of points she receives depends on what position
(organizer, judge, steward) she holds in a competition and how large the com-
petition is (as measured by the number of entries). As she accumulates expe-
rience points, she can advance to the next level (assuming that she achieves
a minimum exam score for that next level). I describe these levels in the fol-
lowing list:
 Apprentice Judge: The BJCP added this level (originally called Novice
judge) in 1995 to recognize anyone who fails to achieve the minimum
score of 60 on the program entrance exam. This level serves as an
encouragement for inexperienced judges to continue to work within the
system and improve on their judging skills.
 Recognized Judge: This level requires a minimum test score of 60 per-
cent. You need no judging experience points to start at this level.
 Certified Judge: This level requires a minimum test score of 70 percent
and at least 5 experience points.
 National Judge: This level requires a minimum test score of 80 percent
and at least 20 experience points.
 Master Judge: This level requires a minimum test score of 90 percent
and at least 40 experience points.
339
Chapter 25: Homebrew Competitions

 Grand Master Judge: This level requires a minimum test score of 90 per-
cent, at least 100 experience points, and an additional point total based
on special services performed on behalf of the BJCP.
Note: Retaking the test to achieve a higher score isn’t only allowed — it’s
encouraged!
One other position is that of Honorary Master Judge. This position is a tempo-
rary designation bestowed by the BJCP on certain persons widely known for
their judging skills and mastery of the craft who may not have fulfilled the
official requirements of that level.
The BJCP program still requires an entrance exam, and the test isn’t free. Your
first shot costs 50 bucks, and the cost for any repeats lowers to $30 — or you
can take either the essay or tasting portions of the test separately for $15.
(How do you think the organization pays for administrative costs?) The BJCP
administers the exam throughout the country on many dates throughout each
year. The frequency is determined by the number of requests for the exam in a
given region and the availability of qualified proctors. (Proctoring the exam 
is one way Grand Master Judges can earn their service points.) For more and
updated information, contact the Beer Judge Certification Program at the 
following Web site: www.bjcp.org.

Part VI: Putting Your Brew to the Test 
Scoring and evaluating beer
From a professional-standards perspective, you
must judge beer, like wine, according to its style.
To judge a hearty vintage Cabernet Sauvignon
against a field of young and fruity Beaujolais
wines wouldn’t be at all fair. Likewise, you can’t
compare a Bock beer to a group of Brown Ales.
You must judge each wine and each beer on its
own merits and against wines and beers of like
style. This type of judging is standard procedure
in the various amateur and commercial beer
competitions that take place across the United
States, including the widely acclaimed Great
American Beer Festival in Denver.
For a person to critically evaluate beer this way,
a reasonable understanding of beer styles and
an ability to be fair and objective is integral to the
process. Anyone who takes upon himself the
task of evaluating beers should do so with at
least a modicum of respect for the beer and 
a maximum of responsibility for the personal 
critique. The correct evaluation of beer requires
the taster to follow certain rules of fairness. A
clean palate is essential to a valid taste assess-
ment of beer. (Judging beer immediately after
eating raw onions or garlic chip dip, for example,
is a definite no-no.) But you also want to avoid
judging beer on an empty stomach (to lessen the
possibility of inebriation).
Yet another problem inherent to taste evaluations
that involve any product containing alcohol is the
fact that alcohol itself deadens the various sen-
sory systems of the human body — especially
the palate. Thus, palate fatigue becomes a prob-
lem. Palate fatigue is what occurs if you taste too
many beers, especially of like style, one after the
other. It’s also the main reason why wine tasters
spit out the wine instead of swallowing it. Beer
tasters, on the other hand, are just too apprecia-
tive to waste a good thing by following that
example.

H
omebrewers who are really into their hobby inevitably continue to dis-
cover more and experiment more, simultaneously expanding their hori-
zons and their own control over their craft. This chapter is for those intrepid
individuals who intend to immerse themselves deeply in new homebrewing
techniques, as well as for the rest of you who just have lots of idle hours on
your hands.
Banking Yeast
Yeast is the logical first choice for advanced involvement in the control over
your beer’s ingredients. Yeast banking, ranching, or farming — call the proce-
dure what you want — is all about culturing your own pure yeast strains and
keeping them on hand for future use in your home brewery. The basic idea
behind yeast banking is that you keep several pure, live yeast cultures — in
bulk quantity — on hand for inoculating your future brews. In short, if you
bank your own yeast, you have the type of yeast you want when you want it
and in sufficient quantities for pitching into your new brew.
As is true of homebrewing itself, you can do your yeast banking on various
levels. At the frugal end, you can use mason jars and cheap wine carafes for
storing yeast. At the extravagant end, expensive glass beakers and flasks lend
a high-tech look to your unfinished basement. The way you decide to go all
depends on your approach.

Before moving on, remember that sanitizing techniques either make or 
break your foray into yeast banking. If you aren’t willing and able to practice
absolutely aseptic (pristinely sanitary) yeast-handling techniques, maybe 
you should just throw the towel in now. (See Chapter 3 for more on proper
sanitation procedures.)
Preparing to open your own bank
When starting up your yeast bank, you should keep it simple. The average
homebrewer probably doesn’t use more than a half-dozen different strains in
a year’s time. For each strain you intend to bank, you need the following
equipment:
 At least one holding tank (for example, a mason jar, wine carafe, or glass
flask). Call this slurry the mother culture. As you continue to propagate
the yeast, you need more vessels.
 A rubber stopper to fit the holding tank (and any other vessels you 
add later).
 An airlock (for each vessel). See Chapter 2 for a discussion of airlocks.
Additional items you need on hand include isopropyl alcohol and sterile
cotton balls for sanitizing yeast-handling equipment (butane lighters also
come in handy to sterilize, or flame, the openings of beer-bottle holding
tanks); dry malt extract to feed the yeast; pure clean water (the same as you
brew with); and the yeasts! Although your goal is self-sufficiency, you still
need to start with pure yeast cultures from a reliable yeast supplier.
Consider using self-stick labels to identify each strain if you’re banking more
than one. One yeast strain doesn’t look a whole lot different from another,
and confusion may undermine your efforts.
Creating yeast
Follow the directions in Chapter 12 for making a yeast starter culture,
because that’s basically what you’re doing. The difference is that after the
yeast completes its mini-fermentation in its holding tank, you can either
repeat the procedure in a larger vessel (such as a half-gallon apple-cider jug)
with more wort, or you can subdivide the yeast into several vessels of the
same size. Using one large vessel is cheaper and easier than using several
smaller ones, but the risk of contamination is lower if you separate the 
mixture into several vessels and open them one at a time rather than reopen
the large one every time you need to pitch a brew. Regardless of how you
store them, keep all your yeast cultures refrigerated until you need them.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

As you’re boiling the wort you intend to use as yeast food, make a larger
batch and store the excess sterile wort in sanitized and capped beer bottles
for future use. (Keep these bottles refrigerated, too.)
Handling Grain
Grain handling is an area of homebrewing into which very few homebrewers
venture — and probably smartly so, because grain growing and malting 
procedures require vast amounts of land, equipment, capital, and expertise.
This task, therefore, is best left to the farmers and maltsters who can provide
you with high-quality product much more quickly and cheaply than you can
possibly produce yourself.
You can, however, manipulate your grains in some small (and very tasty)
ways. Roasting and smoking are a couple of the methods that can give you
more control over your brew.
Roast-a-rama
Why would you want to roast your own grains? Again, it’s a control issue 
(or lack of a social life). Roasted grains give your beer complexity by imbuing
it with various toasty, roasty, and nutty flavors (which isn’t to say that you
can’t just buy these same grains at the local homebrew supplier).
To roast your own grains, start with a couple of pounds of unground pale malt
(Ale or Lager malt is fine) and follow these steps:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Spread the grain out thinly on a cookie sheet or a pizza tin.
3. Place the grain tin on the highest oven rack, set a timer, and watch
the grain closely.
At increments of ten minutes or so, your grain should progress through a
spectrum of gold, amber, copper, and brown colors. (The exact timing of
these changes depends greatly on individual oven efficiency.) You need to
monitor the color-to-taste relationship by periodically (and very carefully)
tasting the grain as it’s roasting.
You’re always better off underroasting your grain than overroasting it. Take
good notes regarding your procedures and use them as guidelines for the
next time around.
345
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) Ways to D.I.G.I.B.I.Y. (Do It, Grow It, Build It Yourself)

If the grain is moist as it goes into the oven, the roasting enhances its aroma
development. You can moisten the grain by briefly wetting it with a plant
mister and allowing it to absorb the moisture for about an hour prior to
roasting.
After you’ve roasted the grain to your satisfaction, allow it to cool sufficiently,
put it into a sealed plastic bag, and leave it alone to mellow over a week’s time
before brewing with it.
Smoke ’em if you got ’em
Instead of just roasting your grains in an oven, you can opt to smoke them on
a grill. You can imbue your grain (and beer) with a variety of smoky aromas
and flavors by burning various types of wood in a barbecue grill or meat
smoker. Put your malt (the same type of grain I describe in the preceding 
section) on something that enables the smoke to waft up through the grain.
One cost-effective smoking method is to buy some disposable aluminum
roasting or pizza tins and poke holes in their bottoms; do not allow flames to
touch these tins — they’re designed for use in low-flame and low-heat appli-
cations and can melt in an instant. If you want to get a little more sophisti-
cated, buy an all-steel strainer (no plastic handles or flammable parts) with a
flat bottom. You probably don’t want to use this utensil for anything else but
smoking grain.
How long you smoke your grain depends on how much grain you’re smoking,
the intensity of the fire, the intensity of the smoke, and your tolerance 
for smoky grain. You need at least a half-hour to imbue the grain with some
smoky character. After the grain has cooled, you’re best off allowing it to
mellow for about a week before using it; keep it stored in a plastic self-
sealing bag.
Some wood choices you can use for smoking grain include alder, apple, beech,
hickory, maple, pear, pecan, and oak; each variety brings its own qualities 
to the fire. Alder, for example, gives malt a sweet, delicate woodiness, and
pecan is more pungent, intense, and spicy. Don’t forget that you can use spicy
mesquite chips or peat for that sharp creosote character found in some
Scotch whiskies.
Di-vine Intervention: Growing Hops
Although only a minority of homebrewers grow hops, hop-growing certainly
does have its advocates.
Homebrewers not only benefit from the bounty of the commercial hop-
processing trade, but they can also now take advantage of the much smaller
346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

but equally satisfying glut of hop rhizomes. (A rhizome is a root cutting — 
the easiest way to start a new hop plant.) You can purchase hop rhizomes
through many homebrew suppliers, although they’re usually available only
very early in the growing season. (That’s late Febrewary through early April,
of course.)
Here we grow!
You can successfully grow hops just about anywhere between the 40th and
50th parallels north and south of the equator. As long as the hops receive
plenty of moisture and ample sunlight, they can thrive.
You need to plant the rhizomes at least a couple weeks after the winter thaw,
in a hole about 6 inches deep (and similar in diameter) within a small mound
of dirt. Cover the root cutting with loamy soil and pack tightly. Make sure that
the location of the plant drains well because molds are quick to attack hop
leaves. If you plant two or more hop varieties, space them at 2-yard intervals.
(That’s 3-foot spaces, not your neighbors’ yards.) Because hops are climbing
vines, you need to rig up a trellis or a network of stakes and twine that fans
out from each hop plant. (Locate the stake close to the hop root.) Check out
the section on building a hop trellis later in this chapter for directions. Any
rig lower than 8 feet high is hardly worth the effort, because hops can easily
grow to greater than 20 feet high. (This lofty stature can present a challenge
to the homebrewer at harvest time.)
As the hop shoots begin to emerge in late March or early April, clip all but
the four healthiest bines. (For some odd reason, hop vines are called bines.
Why? Who knows? Maybe the brewer who named them had too much of his
own brew or was a lousy speller.) This clipping concentrates the plant’s ener-
gies. As they grow upward on their own, they start to droop under their own
weight — this point is when you need to train them on the twine. Wrap the
plants loosely around the twine in a clockwise direction, coming up the twine
(unless you live in the Southern Hemisphere, in which case you want to train
them in a counterclockwise direction coming up). This positioning is impor-
tant because the bines follow the sun from east to west every day as they
grow. During peak growing season, healthy hop plants can grow as much as a
foot each day.
To ensure a good, healthy plant and an abundant harvest, I always treat my
hop plants to a biweekly application of water-soluble, all-purpose plant food.
Pick a hop, any hop
Harvest season begins sometime in August and may continue into October,
depending on climatic conditions. As the hop flowers grow in size, sporadi-
cally check the development of the lupulin glands. You can find these glands
347
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) Ways to D.I.G.I.B.I.Y. (Do It, Grow It, Build It Yourself)

by gently pulling the soft, leafy petals back against the stem; the yellow
lupulin glands are at the base of each petal near the stem. As the season
wears on, the hop flowers puff up slightly and the lupulin glands begin to
swell. (Of course, how much is a swell if you’re talking about something the
size of a pinhead?)
If the hops begin to burn in the sun or turn brown, you’d best pick them
soon. If you allow the hops to deteriorate, you lose the freshness edge of
growing your own hops.
Not all the hops mature at the same pace; you need to pick on several differ-
ent occasions before the season ends. Checking the plant once a week should
be fine unless the weather is particularly hot, cool, wet, or dry. If you pick on
a regular weekly schedule, you usually have your hop-drying device emptied
just in time for the next batch of freshly picked hops.
Drying and storing your hops
Each time you pick some hops, you need to dry them before storing them.
Air-drying is fine, but how long this process takes depends on the humidity
levels in the air. I usually dry my hops for a week to make sure that they’re as
dry as possible
The dried hops should feel light and crumbly in your hands; in fact, the indi-
vidual leaves may fall off the stem easily. Store them in self-sealing zipper-type
sandwich bags (in the size of your choice). Attach self-stick labels to each bag,
noting the variety (if you grow more than one) and the date you picked the
hops. (You can also just mark the bag with a grease pencil.) You may want to
weigh each bag, although quantity isn’t really important until brewing day.
Store all your hops in your freezer to keep them as long as possible.
Building Brewing Equipment
This section explains ways for you to take control of your brewing process 
by making your own equipment rather than buying it, thus enabling you to
take more personal control over your spending processes as well.
Chillin’ out: Immersion wort chillers
An immersion wort chiller is a very effective piece of equipment that’s rela-
tively easy and not incredibly expensive to make yourself (refer to Figure 12-2
earlier in the book). The basic idea behind the immersion wort chiller is to
348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

cool down your wort quickly (without subjecting your brew to contamination)
so that you can pitch your yeast and start fermentation as soon as possible.
Start with a coil of copper tubing purchased at your local hardware store.
This tubing should have a minimum inside diameter of 3⁄8 inches and be at
least 25 feet long. The longer and wider the tubing is, the more effective it is,
but I don’t recommend exceeding 1⁄2 inch in diameter or 40 feet in length. (And
this extreme size is necessary only for full wort boils — see Chapter 12 for
more information on that process.) The circumference of the coil itself
should be about two-thirds the diameter of your brewpot, and the coil height
should equal the height of your brewpot. (You can fashion the coil’s dimen-
sions yourself by simply constricting or expanding the coil by hand.) Along
with this tubing, you also need a regular garden hose (with a threaded end
you can attach to a faucet) you can cut up into shorter pieces. To make
bends in the copper tubing without kinking it, use an inexpensive manual
spring-type tubing bender (available at most hardware stores). Make sure
that you buy a couple expansion clamps for the hose connections.
By working with only the first and last foot or two of each end of the copper
tubing, you leave the majority of the coil intact. With the copper coil standing
on end, bend the top end of the tubing straight up from the coil and add a 90-
degree outward bend. To this end, attach a section of garden hosing (with the
faucet attachment here) and tighten the two sections together by using a
clamp. With the coil still standing on end, pull the bottom end of the tubing
up through the middle of the coil to the same height as the first end and give
it a 90-degree outward bend. To this bottom end, attach another length of
garden hose and tighten the two together by using a clamp. Just rinse the
chiller off, hook it up to a faucet, and, voilà! You’re good to go.
Tuns of fun: Lauter tun
A lauter tun is absolutely necessary for effective sparging of all-grain brews.
Making your own is simple. Typically, all you need are two 5-gallon plastic
buckets, one of which must have a spigot. If you have a bottling bucket from
your beginner homebrewing days, you’re halfway home. Buy a second food-
grade plastic (HDPE) bucket that fits into your bottling bucket. Using a 1⁄8-inch
drill bit, cover the entire bottom of the second bucket with holes 1⁄4 inch
apart. After you finish, make sure that you remove all plastic burrs inside the
bucket and out.
By placing the second bucket inside your bottling bucket, you’ve got an effec-
tive straining system that enables you to draw off the wort through the spigot
while the grain is held back (which is the fundamental concept behind the
lauter tun); see Figure 26-1. One important consideration in setting up your
double-bucket lauter tun: You need to keep the bottoms of the inside and out-
side buckets less than 2 inches apart. A larger space messes with the flow of
wort through the grain bed and may also aerate the hot wort and contribute
to oxidation problems down the line.
349
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) Ways to D.I.G.I.B.I.Y. (Do It, Grow It, Build It Yourself)

Another slightly more difficult way of making a larger-capacity lauter tun is
by using a plastic cooler — the type people use for picnicking or camping.
You can use both the rectangular ice-chest design and the upright circular
types. I recommend a 10-gallon minimum capacity. The idea is to build a
small manifold out of half-inch copper tubing (with the help of 90-degree
elbows and T connectors) that rests on the bottom of the coolers and draws
off the wort through the cooler’s drain hole.
For the rectangular cooler, you must connect and feed a series of four or five
long parallel tubes into a short perpendicular tube at the drain end of the
cooler. This end tube must then connect to a spigot or stopcock on the out-
side of the cooler for flow control. For the circular cooler, the best design is
the shape of an X, with one leg connecting directly through the drain hole to
the stopcock or spigot on the outside of the cooler.
If you need to seal the opening where the copper tubing exits the cooler, use
the silicone caulk you typically use for bathroom applications. The silicone
doesn’t harm your beer.
For the tubing to drain correctly and channel the wort to the opening in the
cooler, you must first slit or cross-cut the copper tubing with a hacksaw. You
need to make several cuts about halfway through the tubing (you’re not
trying to cut pieces off) about every half inch or so apart. You also need to
cap the open ends of the tubing so that no grain escapes with the wort. After
you complete the slit-cutting, make sure you brush and rinse off any copper
burrs. (Try wet-sanding with emery cloth.) Position the manifold tubes in the
cooler with the slots facing downward.
Figure 26-1:

your own
lauter tun.
350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

You don’t need to solder the parts together; copper fittings are normally snug
enough to maintain connections. And by not making the connections perma-
nent, you can more easily disassemble the manifold for cleaning purposes.
Pot o’ plenty: Large-volume brewpot
Instead of buying a huge and expensive stock pot from a restaurant supply
outlet, do what hundreds of homebrewers do — fashion one out of a real
beer keg. This approach works well for several reasons:
 Beer kegs are stainless steel, just like brewpots.
 Buying a used beer keg is much cheaper than buying an equivalent-sized
stock pot.
 The most common American beer keg (half-barrel) has a capacity of 15.5
gallons, which is more than enough for a full batch of homebrew. Even
50- and 30-liter European beer kegs are roomy enough.
The beer kegs that work best are the straight-sided Sanke kegs. The advan-
tages to the Sanke keg are that no bung hole is cut in the side of the keg and it
has built-in handles at the rim. Because Miller and Anheuser-Busch use these
kegs extensively, you should have no difficulty finding them. After you get
your hands on one, you need to find someone who does stainless steel weld-
ing. (If you’re not in the trade, avoid doing the work yourself.) Stainless steel
is a very hard metal, requiring specialized saw blades and drill bits. Make
sure that someone trained in TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding, also known as
heliarc welding, does the work for you; you can’t weld stainless steel with reg-
ular mild-steel material. Unless you have good connections with people in the
trade, you’re going to fork over between $25 and $50 an hour for this kind of
work. Fortunately, the work you need done doesn’t entail much (and it’s still
cheaper than buying a new brewpot). You need to have your welder saw off
and grind down the lid of the keg (at least to the point that it’s no longer
capable of ripping human flesh), and you want to have him or her attach a
spigot near the bottom of the keg.
Cold feat: Lagering cellar
To brew authentic Lager beers, you need the capability to lager your beer,
which means you need to store it in a cold environment for relatively long
periods of time. Not many homebrewers have the means to do this because
lagering requires time, space, energy, and money — four things that aren’t
always in great supply at the amateur level.
351
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) Ways to D.I.G.I.B.I.Y. (Do It, Grow It, Build It Yourself)

If you don’t already have one, consider investing in a dedicated beer fridge.
Because most refrigerators are designed to keep foods very cool (cooler than
a lagering cellar should be), you need to buy one more item that enables the
fridge to warm up a bit: an external thermostat. This fermostat controls the
interior temperature of your beer fridge by shutting the refrigerator off at the
temperature you designate. You can purchase this device through most
homebrew suppliers and can hook it up in a matter of minutes. Again, effec-
tive lagering temperatures should remain fairly constant between 40 and 50
degrees Fahrenheit depending on the beer style.
Another way to capitalize on this concept is to build an enlarged beer cellar
that includes removing the door of a refrigerator and attaching a large
wooden box (complete with a utility or access door) in its place. Crafted of
heavy plywood sheathing and lined with thick insulating material such as
Styrofoam, this box offers a two- or threefold increase in the fridge’s capacity
with very little increase in electrical usage. How big you make this box
depends on your needs and space constraints. Let your imagination run wild!

I
n the ever-expanding world of homebrewing, hundreds — perhaps thou-
sands — of people are trying to build a better mousetrap (although what
good a mousetrap is to a homebrewer, I may never know). Someone is always
coming up with new and better ways to make beer at home. Tremendous
changes have taken place in the two decades that I’ve been brewing my own
beer, and, undoubtedly, more fascinating and time-saving inventions are sure
to appear in the future.
This chapter gives you an idea of the types of items available to make your
brewing easier and more convenient. These gadgets aren’t absolutely neces-
sary for making good beer, and a few of them can put a real dent in your
pocketbook. Whether you decide to buy them is just a question of how far
you want to go with your hobby. You can purchase most — if not all — of
these thingies at your favorite homebrew supply store.
Digital Thermometer and pH Meter
If you’re practicing mashing techniques, you’re already well aware of the
need for thermometers and pH testing papers. Investing in digital equipment
just makes the job a little bit easier and a lot more accurate. An appropriate
digital thermometer costs anywhere between $15 and $25, and the pH meter
will set you back $50 to $70.

Wort Aeration System
This system is a very effective way of aerating your wort to create a better
environment for yeast respiration cycles. A pump sends ordinary air through
a sterile filter and delivers it to the beer by way of a beer stone that diffuses
oxygen into the beer. (This device isn’t unlike the aerators that fish tanks use.)
You can also find fully contained wort aeration systems that include a small
canister of 99.9 percent pure compressed oxygen and an easy-to-sanitize 
stainless-steel diffusion stone. A wort aeration system will run you $30 to $50.
Auto Siphon
A couple of different kinds of auto siphons are available, but they mostly vary
only by length and diameter. These gizmos help eliminate the risk of contami-
nation and start siphon flows quickly and easily during racking and bottling
procedures. You can expect to pay somewhere between $10 and $15 for an
auto siphon.
Counterpressure Bottle Filler
This device allows homebrewers who keg their beer to transfer the beer into
glass bottles without losing the beer’s carbonation. This capability is impor-
tant to kegging brewers who want to send bottles of their beer to competi-
tions or to those who filter their homebrew. (See the following section for
more information on the beer filter.) The bottle filler itself will cost you $50 
to $60, but remember that it also requires a CO2 system (tanks, gauges, hoses,
fittings), which will increase your total cost. See Chapter 13 for more informa-
tion on bottling; check out Chapter 25 for more on entering homebrew 
competitions.
Beer Filter
Beer filters do exactly what they say they do: They remove yeast and particu-
late matter, creating a clearer beer. To filter homebrew, however, you must
force the liquid through the filter under pressure, which requires a CO2 system
and a minimum of two pressure vessels such as soda kegs. If you filter all the
yeast from the beer, however, bottle-priming by using corn sugar is no longer
an option, and you may need to artificially carbonate your beer. Homebrewers
354
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

have a choice between the plate type of filter (about $50) and the cartridge
type ($70). I vote for the more-convenient cartridge type. Remember that
because this gadget requires a CO2 system, the cost of whichever option you
choose will go up. See Chapter 13 for more on bottling.
Germicidal Lamp
This hand-held germ eliminator is portable and battery-powered, and it can
kill 99.9 percent of surface bacteria with a 10-second exposure. It’s great for
use as a dry sanitizer for all kinds of brewing and non-brewing equipment and
will set you back $25 to $30.
Wort Transfer Pump
These electrical/mechanical devices take racking to whole new level by elimi-
nating the need to siphon. These pumps can be magnetic, diaphragm, or peri-
staltic, but they all do the same thing: make your life easier. Making your life
richer may be another story: You’ll need to plunk down $130 to $150 for one of
these babies. Note: Like all electrical devices used with or near liquids, always
plug these pumps into a GFI- (Ground Fault Interrupter) protected outlet.
Refractometer
Using a refractometer is the quick and easy way to measure the sugar content
of any liquid such as unfermented wort (beer) or must (mead or wine). To
convert degrees Brix (the refractometer’s measuring scale) to Specific Gravity,
multiply the Brix reading by .004 and add a whole number 1 (example: a 
Brix reading of 10 equals 1.040). Expect to pay between $50 and $60 for a
refractometer.
Mashing Sparge Arm
This self-powered rotating sparge arm produces an evenly distributed, rain-
like spray that doesn’t bore holes in the mash. This sparger is made of brass
and comes complete with a handy holding bracket. It’s available in various
diameters to fit various sparging vessels and costs between $30 and $40.

Counterflow Wort Chiller
At first glance, you may think that this piece of equipment is redundant.
Unlike the immersion-type wort chiller mentioned in Chapter 2, however, the
counterflow wort chiller is a quicker and more efficient means of cooling hot
wort. Cold water in an outer hose flows in an opposite direction from the hot
wort flowing within the inner copper tubing. This product runs anywhere
from $80 to $150.

which I include in Part IV of this book) for several
years prior to the introduction of brewing soft-

 Methodology questions
P
eople unfamiliar with the art and craft of homebrewing always seem to
have the same questions. Here’s a sampling of their oft-repeated queries,
along with my answers to them.
How Much Is Taking Up Homebrewing
Going to Cost?
At the beginner level, the minimum amount of equipment you need to brew
beer correctly is going to run you in the vicinity of $70. This setup is relatively
bare-bones in nature, but it’s enough to get you up and running. Eventually,
you want to acquire more and better equipment as you become more familiar
and comfortable with the processes and procedures. (I know some home-
brewers who’ve spent in excess of $1,000 on their home breweries.)

How Much Does the Average 
Batch of Beer Cost?
The average batch of homebrewed beer is 5 gallons, or 53.3 12-ounce bottles
of beer. At the beginner level, the ingredients for a typical batch run about
$30 to $35. The amount you actually pay fluctuates because of many factors,
including where you shop for your ingredients (don’t forget shipping charges
for mail order), whether you buy top- or bottom-of-the-line ingredients, and
the style of beer you like to brew. Big-bodied, alcoholic beers require more
fermentable ingredients than do light-bodied, watery beers. (Barley Wines
can cost as much as 100 percent more to make than Pale Ales.)
And because extract brewers pay a premium for the convenience of using
processed malt syrups, efficient all-grain brewers can produce beer 
more cheaply.
Where Can I Buy Homebrewing
Supplies?
Homebrew supply shops are commonplace these days. Whereas they were
once located in clandestine little holes-in-the-wall, you can now find home-
brew suppliers anywhere from old factory buildings to modern strip malls.
Even some craft breweries and liquor stores have set aside unused floor
space for retail homebrew-supply sales.
And, of course, you may have heard of this little thing called the Internet? I
understand quite a few sites out there are just waiting for you to click and
order (check out the Cheat Sheet for places to start your search).
How Long Does Making a Batch 
of Homebrew Take?
At the beginner level, the actual brewing process takes only about two hours,
including setup and cleanup. On the day you bottle your beer, schedule at
least three hours, including setup and cleanup.
At the extreme short end of the process, you can conceivably drink your 
beer within three weeks of brewing it, but most experienced homebrewers
like their beers to age and mellow for as long as four to six weeks. Initial 
358
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

fermentation needs to last at least five to seven days. A maturation period in
a secondary fermenter lasts at least a week, probably two. After you bottle
your beer, you want to set aside another two weeks for the beer to carbonate
and clarify correctly.
Is Homebrewed Beer Better Than
Commercially Made Beer?
Is it automatically better? No. Is it generally better? Not necessarily. Does the
potential exist to make homebrew that’s better than commercially made
beer? Very emphatically, YES! It’s been my experience that homebrewers
have the ability to make some of the best beer in the world, if they’re commit-
ted enough to try. I know because I’ve made some great beers and I’ve had
the pleasure of tasting many truly outstanding world-class beers at home-
brewing competitions (one of the perks of being a beer judge).
How Do You Carbonate Homebrew?
One of the natural functions of yeasts during fermentation is to produce
carbon dioxide. After the initial phase of fermentation is complete, you can
prime your beer by using a small (but exact) measure of highly fermentable
sugar as you bottle it. The yeast cells that remain in the solution feed on
these sugars and create the appropriate level of CO2 carbonation within the
sealed bottle. Check out Chapter 13 for more bottling information.
How Do I Add Alcohol to Homebrew?
You don’t need to add alcohol to homebrew because the yeast naturally pro-
duces the alcohol during fermentation. Yeast cells feed on the natural malt
sugars in the liquid, producing ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide in return.
Can I Distill Homebrew into Whiskey?
Yes and no. Yes, distilling homebrew is technically feasible, but no, distilling
any alcoholic beverage in a private residence is not at all legal in the United
States — anytime or anywhere (unless, of course, you’ve registered your still
with the appropriate governmental agencies).
359
Chapter 28: Just the FAQs: Ten (or so) Frequently Asked Questions

Can I Sell Homebrew?
Not legally (in the United States). Attempting to sell an untaxed, unregulated
alcoholic beverage is a violation of several state and federal laws — just 
ask Al Capone. Unless you want the FBI knocking on your door, I don’t 
recommend it.
Why Shouldn’t I Age Beer in the 
Plastic Primary Fermenter?
You have two good reasons not to age beer in a plastic primary fermenter.
First, the beer would sit on all the yeast sediment and protein fallout from the
fermented beer and would eventually pick up off flavors. Second, even HDPE
(high-density polyethylene) food-grade plastic is permeable by oxygen 
molecules over a long period of time; glass and stainless steel, however, are
completely impermeable.
Do I Have to Worry About Things
Blowing Up in My House?
Tales of explosions while homebrewing are mostly old wives’ tales. Any
explosions that may occur while making beer at home are usually nothing
more than excess carbon dioxide being vented from enclosed vessels such 
as fermenters, carboys, and bottles. The worst thing about these eruptions is
the mess they leave for you to clean up.

Malt: Grainy Names and Extract Excerpts
Here’s a glimpse at the world of cereal grains used in the realm of profes-
sional brewing and widely available at the homebrew level. First up is a list 
of grain producers whose products are commonly used by professional 
brewers but may also be found at the homebrewing level. Following that list
is a type-specific list of grain. In this second list, I’ve included the various
grain types, divided by their usage (base grain, specialty grain, adjunct grain)
and other details such as their Lovibond ratings and whether they require
mashing. Finally, you find a semi-comprehensive list of malt extract brands
that produce a wide variety of beer kits for the extract homebrewer.
You’ll notice here and elsewhere when shopping for brewing grains that many
of the grain names are branded, meaning the malting companies market them
by specific names. Also of note: Whenever you see a grain with the prefix
cara-, it simply denotes a caramel malt (also known as crystal malt).

Producers of grains
The following list includes many of the top producers of grain for the brewing
industry worldwide. These company names are widely known in the commer-
cial brewing arena and are becoming more familiar and sought-after at the
homebrewing level.
Briess: This Wisconsin-based maltster is one of the primary suppliers of
brewer’s grain to the microbrewing industry, particularly in the Midwestern
U.S. In addition to the wide range of malted grains that the company pro-
duces, Briess also markets a full line of liquid and dry malt extracts called
CBW, or Concentrated Brewer’s Wort.
Crisp Malting: This English malthouse in County Norfolk, England, exports its
distinctive Maris Otter brand of 2-row, pale, and crystal malts to North
America. Maris Otter is a barley variety renowned by U.K. brewers.
Dingemans: The Dingemans family has produced an extensive range of basic
ingredients for the demanding Belgian and European brewer since 1875. The
result is an outstanding line of brewer’s and specialty malts used not only in
Pilsen type beers but also in Trappist, Abbey, and White beers.
Durst: An authentic German malt producer located in the fatherland of beer,
Durst began as a family-owned country brewery and malthouse 170 years
ago. It sold its first malt exports in 1924 and has since expanded into an 
international supplier producing 157,000 U.S. tons of malt each year.
Gambrinus Malting: This small Canadian maltster produces some of the
finest 2-row malt in the world. Gambrinus Malting also produces malts not
made by other well-known maltsters, such as the almost-forgotten bruhmalt,
a pale malt that imbues the beer with a honeyed aroma and flavor.
Great Western Malting: Many consider Great Western Malting’s 2-row pale
malt to be the best in the U.S; many of the biggest microbrewers on the West
Coast use this base grain.
Hugh Baird: Located in the U.K., the Hugh Baird Malting Company is one of
the world’s best suppliers of specialty malts and authentic 2-row British Pale
Ale malt.
Meussdoerffer: Since 1852, the name Meussdoerffer has exemplified prod-
ucts of excellent quality made in accordance with the strict traditional rules
of the Bavarian purity law. Cargill Malt introduced the excellent malts of
Meussdoerffer to the North American brewery market.
362
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Paul’s Malt: Paul’s Malt originated in the first half of the 19th century on the
east coast of England, where its headquarters still reside today. Today, Paul’s
Malt is a modern company and the U.K.’s largest maltster, producing in
excess of 500,000 British tons of malt per year.
Rahr Malting: Rahr Malting Co. is a family owned company that has been in
business since 1847. It produces and distributes malt and industry-related
brewing supplies. Rahr’s malt production plants are located in Shakopee,
Minnesota, and Alix, Alberta.
Schreier: This small maltster from Wisconsin is one of the small malting
houses distributed by the American conglomerate Cargill.
Simpson’s: Established in 1866 by corn merchant James Parker Simpson,
Simpson’s is still the largest totally independently family-owned malting 
company in the U.K. The company manufactures a wide range of quality
malts, including specialty roasted malts, for the brewing, distilling, and food
industries.
Weyermann: The 118-year-old malthouse housing Mich. Weyermann & Co.
KG Malzfabrik is a protected historic site. But behind the red-brick turn-of-
the-century building in Bamberg, Germany, lies the modernized heart of the
world’s leading manufacturer of specialty brewing malts. For over a century,
Mich. Weyermann has been providing specialty malts to breweries large and
small on virtually every continent of the world.
The international conglomerate Con-Agra owns Canada Malting, Great
Western Malting, Hugh Baird, and others, making it the world’s largest malt-
ster. Similarly, the American malting conglomerate Cargill imports and 
distributes Paul’s Malt, Muessdoerffer, Gambrinus, and Schreier.
Types of grains
This section provides you with details about a variety of base, specialty, and
adjunct grains available to the homebrewer. I’ve listed Lovibond ratings and
the need for mashing procedures, along with a ton of background information
on each individual grain. This is by no means an exhaustive listing — many
more grains are available in the market.
Base grains
Base grains denote all the malted grains (barley, wheat, rye, etc.) used to
make beer. Brewers must mash all base grains order to create the wort that
becomes beer through the magic of fermentation. Beginner and intermediate
homebrewers can simply use malt extract to create their wort.
363
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of barley grain: 2-row (domestic) 
Degrees Lovibond: 1.8
Mashed: Yes
Description: You can use 2-row malt as the base malt for all Lager and Ale
styles. Although it yields a slightly higher maltose (malt sugar) extract than 
6-row malt, it also costs more per pound. However, 2-row malt tends to give 
a smoother, less grainy-flavored beer. Two-row malt also tends to have fewer
proteins and yield a lighter color than 6-row malt.
Type of barley grain: 2-row Lager 
Degrees Lovibond: 1.4
Mashed: Yes
Description: The American brewing industry loves this low-protein 2-row
malt. Because of 2-row’s lower enzyme content, the addition of higher-
enzyme 6-row malt is often recommended (enzymes are what are needed to
break down the grain’s complex malt sugars during the mashing phase).
Type of barley grain: 6-row Lager (domestic) 
Degrees Lovibond: 1.8
Mashed: Yes
Description: Six-row malt is less expensive to use than 2-row malt and is also
more readily available. You can use this grain as the base for all Lager and Ale
styles. It has a thicker husk and higher protein content than 2-row malt. Six-
row malt also has more enzymes, which makes it a good choice to use in con-
junction with adjunct grains or wheat malt.
Type of barley grain: Pale Ale malt
Degrees Lovibond: 3
Mashed: Yes
Description: You can use Pale Ale malt as a base malt or in conjunction with
regular 2-row malt to impart a richer malt flavor and additional color. Pale Ale
malt is a 2-row variety that’s kilned longer and usually better-modified, giving
it a more pronounced flavor than regular 2-row malt. It’s also deeper in color,
which can add golden hues to your wort. The enzymes in Pale Ale malt can
support the use of nonenzymatic specialty malts.
Type of barley grain: Mild Ale malt
Degrees Lovibond: 3
Mashed: Yes
Description: This grain is a lightly kilned pale malt that provides a subtle
nutty flavor. British brewers favor Mild Ale malt for mild Ales and Bitters.
Type of barley grain: Pilsener
Degrees Lovibond: 1.2
Mashed: Yes
Description: Two-row Pilsener malt is the palest malt available. You can use it
as a base malt for any Lager recipe. High-enzyme levels allow for mashing of
large percentages of (nonenzymatic) adjunct grains.
364
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Type of barley grain: Dextrin malt
Degrees Lovibond: 1.5
Mashed: No
Description: Dextrin malt adds body, head retention, and beer stability 
without influencing flavor. (Dextrins occur naturally in malt and are one con-
tributor to the body of beer.) The nonfermentables contained in dextrin malt
are perfect for balancing the body and flavor of dark-colored beers. One 
maltster in particular (Briess) has its own trade name (CaraPils). You can
simply steep dextrin malt and strain it into the brewpot.
Type of barley grain: CaraVienne
Degrees Lovibond: 20
Mashed: Yes/No
Description: This term was coined by the old DeWolf-Cosyns maltster for that
company’s medium-colored crystal malt. You can steep or mash CaraVienne.
Type of barley grain: CaraMunich
Degrees Lovibond: 55
Mashed: Yes/No
Description: This term was coined by the old DeWolf-Cosyns maltster for that
company’s dark-colored crystal malt, which has an assertive, malty flavor.
You can also steep or mash CaraMunich.
Type of barley grain: Vienna malt
Degrees Lovibond: 4
Mashed: Yes
Description: You can use the lightly kilned Vienna malt in place of standard
pale malt as a base malt for your brew. This malt type contributes a slightly
maltier, grainy flavor and a deeper golden color than standard base malt
does. Increased enzymes are sufficient to support large quantities of spe-
cialty or adjunct malts in the mash. For Pilsener beer, use Vienna malt for
between 10 and 30 percent of the total malt in your recipe for color and malty
flavor. For amber Vienna-Style Lager beers, I suggest between 60 and 90 per-
cent Vienna malt, along with a percentage of low-Lovibond crystal malt.
Type of barley grain: Light Munich
Degrees Lovibond: 10
Mashed: Yes
Description: Munich malt is a Lager malt that has been lightly kilned to pro-
vide a pronounced grainy flavor without adding nonfermentables or affecting
the foam stability and the body. Small amounts of this Lager malt added to
the grist can improve the malty flavor and give a richer color to low-gravity
brews. You can improve Amber and Märzen beers if Munich malt comprises
between 5 and 15 percent of the malt in your recipe, although the more
robust Bock beers and Dark Lager beers may require 10 to 30 percent 
Munich malt.
365
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of barley grain: Dark Munich
Degrees Lovibond: 20
Mashed: Yes
Description: Similar to Light Munich malt, Dark Munich malt is kilned to a
slightly higher degree, providing a modest color increase toward the orange
and deep copper hues. For Bock beers and Dark Lagers, Dark Munich malt
needs to account for only 5 to 7 percent of the total amount of malt in the
recipe to achieve the malty, grainy flavors characteristic of these styles.
Type of wheat grain: Malted Wheat
Degrees Lovibond: 2.5
Mashed: Yes
Description: Wheat grain is completely different from barley grain in both
appearance and composition. Unlike barley, the kernels of wheat have no
husks. Malted wheat gives a malty flavor that you can’t get by using just raw
wheat. (See the “Specialty grains” section for more information on unmalted
wheat.) For Weizenbier, use between 50 and 75 percent wheat malt; for
Berliner-Style Weissbier, use between 25 and 35 percent wheat malt. You can
also use small portions of wheat malt (0.5 to 1.5 percent of total grist) in all
beer styles to aid in head retention.
Specialty grains
Specialty grains denote all the malted and unmalted grains (barley, wheat,
rye, oats, etc.) you can add to the wort to give the finished beer a wide vari-
ety of colors and flavors that base grains don’t provide. Both all-grain brewers
(those who mash their grains to create their wort) and extract brewers (those
who create their wort from malt extract) can use specialty grains effectively.
Type of specialty grain: Wheat (unmalted) 
Degrees Lovibond: 2.5
Mashed: No
Description: Brewers use unmalted wheat exclusively for flavoring and for
head retention because it contributes no fermentable sugars or sweetness.
The use of unmalted wheat, such as in Kölschbier and Witbier, often results
in an unavoidable protein haze in the beer.
Type of specialty grain: Crystal malt
Degrees Lovibond: 10–120
Mashed: No
Description: Also called caramel malt, this grain undergoes the kilning
process while the grain kernels are still moist. This process causes the
starches to convert to sugars and the sugars to crystallize within the grain
husk (thus the crystal malt designation). Crystal malts are kilned to various
Lovibond colors, usually in increments of 10 degrees. Crystal malt con-
tributes color, caramel flavor, body, stability, and head retention to beer. The
366
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

higher the Lovibond number, the darker the color and the more sweet
caramelly flavor the grain contributes to the beer. Crystal malt may be made
from 2-row or 6-row barley.
Type of specialty grain: Special “B”
Degrees Lovibond: 221
Mashed: Yes/No
Description: This very dark crystal malt was unique to the Belgian 
maltster DeWolf-Cosyns. (Special “B” is a trade name). It provides a very
highly caramelized and chocolatey-nutty flavor. Therefore, you can substitute
Special “B” for chocolate malt if you want to avoid roast grain bitterness. 
You can steep or mash Special “B,” and it’s great in Brown Ales, Porters, and
Belgian specialty styles. One pound in a 5-gallon batch goes a long way.
Type of specialty grain: Victory Malt
Degrees Lovibond: 25
Mashed: Yes
Description: Victory Malt is a fully modified product designed to contribute 
a warm, nutty, toasty flavor and a deep golden to brown color to beer. For
Amber Ales, I suggest 2 to 5 percent of total grist; for Porter, 5 to 10 percent;
and for nut Brown Ales, 10 to 15 percent.
Type of specialty grain: Biscuit Malt
Degrees Lovibond: 25
Mashed: Yes
Description: This grain is a lightly roasted 2-row pale malt designed to 
contribute a baked-bread flavor to beer.
Type of specialty grain: Special Roast
Degrees Lovibond: 50
Mashed: Yes
Description: Special Roast is a malted specialty grain that contributes a 
biscuity flavor to beer, which is particularly well suited to English Ales. Use
between 2 and 5 percent total grist for Amber Ales and between 5 and 
10 percent for Brown Ales and Porters.
Type of specialty grain: Chocolate malt
Degrees Lovibond: 350
Mashed: No
Description: Chocolate malt is kilned to a dark brown color (but not as 
dark as black malt). And, as its name suggests, chocolate malt can imbue
beer with dark brown color and a dry, chocolatey flavor, a pleasing color and
flavor combination that’s very complementary in Brown Ales, Dark Lagers,
Porters, and Stouts. A small amount of chocolate malt goes a long way, so
don’t use more than the amount of chocolate malt required to make 
10 percent of the total grist.
367
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of specialty grain: Black malt
Degrees Lovibond: 500
Mashed: No
Description: This malted grain is kilned to high temperatures, giving a 
black, charred appearance to any beer in which it’s used in even modest 
proportions. The acrid, sometimes smoky flavor of black malt is a prime
characteristic of Porters and Stouts. Up to 10 percent of the recipe for these
styles may be black malt.
Type of specialty grain: Roasted Barley
Degrees Lovibond: 500
Mashed: No
Description: Roasted Barley, unlike most other brewhouse grains, is
unmalted. A slow roasting process gives this grain a sharp roasted, almost
acrid flavor without charring the grain. Only small amounts of roasted barley
(3 to 7 percent) are necessary to give its dark color and dry, roasty, coffeelike
flavors to Stouts and Porters.
Type of specialty grain: Rye Malt
Degrees Lovibond: 4
Mashed: Yes
Description: Of all the malted grains, rye is probably the most difficult to
classify. Rye doesn’t comply with the German Purity Law because it’s not
barley — nor is wheat, for that matter. But unlike wheat, rye is never used as
a base grain (more than 50 percent of the grist). Because rye is used only as 
a flavoring grain, it seems to belong with the specialty grains. I recommend
that rye malt make up no more than 20 percent of any recipe. Rye also comes
in flaked (pregelatinized) form. Flaked rye gives a higher extract yield than
conventional malted rye because the complex sugars in pregelatinized grain
are easier for the enzymes to break down during mashing.
Type of specialty grain: Smoked malt
Mashed: Yes/No
Description: This is malted barley that has been smoked over wood — 
usually beechwood but occasionally a peat fire. Beechwood-smoked malt 
is most popular in traditional German Rauchbier, and peat-smoked malt is
common in traditional Scottish Ales. In either case, the smoked malt transfers
its smoky qualities to the beer as you steep or mash the grain.
Adjunct grains
The previous sections cover base grains, which are malted and must be
mashed to make beer, and specialty grains which can be malted or unmalted
and don’t require mashing to add color and flavor to beer. This section 
provides a list of adjunct grains, which can be malted or unmalted and can 
be used as either a base grain or specialty grain (and two of these “grains”
come as syrups).
368
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Type of adjunct grain: Rice
Degrees Lovibond: 0
Mashed: Yes
Description: You can use rice as a whole grain, in its flaked (pregelatinized)
form, or in a prepared syrup. You need to cook whole rice in a cereal cooker
to gelatinize the starches. After cooking, mash the rice with enzyme-rich
barley malt. You can add flaked rice directly to the mash and rice syrup
directly to the brewkettle. As you can see by the Lovibond rating, rice adds
virtually no color whatsoever to the beer. To keep its beers very pale,
megabrewer Anheuser-Busch uses rice in place of a portion of barley malt.
Type of adjunct grain: Corn
Degrees Lovibond: 0
Mashed: Yes
Description: You can use corn as a whole grain, as flaked maize (pregela-
tinized corn), or in a prepared syrup. Like rice, you need to cook whole 
corn in a cereal cooker to gelatinize the starches, and then mash it with
enzyme-rich barley malt. You can add flaked maize directly to the mash and
corn syrup directly to the brewkettle. As you can see by the Lovibond rating,
corn adds virtually no color whatsoever to the beer, so big commercial 
brewers around the world use corn in place of a portion of barley malt to
keep their beers very pale.
Type of adjunct grain: Oats
Degrees Lovibond: 2.2
Mashed: Yes
Description: Like rice and corn, you can use oats as a whole grain, as flakes
(pregelatinized), or in processed form. You must mash malted oats with
enzyme-rich barley malt, but you can also throw processed oatmeal into the
mash with the rest of the grain just to add texture and flavor to the beer. Try
using unmalted oats, in the form of flakes, for flavoring and improved head
retention.
Malt extract brands
Following is an alphabetical list of malt-extract brand names and their 
countries of origin. This list is simply to help beginners become familiar with
brand names so that they can make informed choices on appropriate malts
for their desired beer styles. In other words, if I intended to brew a Pale 
Ale, I wouldn’t choose an extract brand produced in Germany. Conversely, 
if I wanted to brew a lager, I wouldn’t choose a kit made in the U.K.

Top Hops: Hop Varieties and Descriptions
The world of hops is a fairly big one — one that continues to grow every year.
Because of this scope, the discussion of hop varieties can be a fairly confus-
ing subject. This section, which you should use in conjunction with Chapter
5, is designed to help you make decisions about which hops you should use
in your brews.
You typically base your primary hop-choosing decision on the alpha-acid
content of the hop variety — this characteristic tells you the bittering poten-
tial of the hop variety, or how much bitterness a particular variety may add
to your beer. You make a secondary decision in regards to the hops’ aromatic
potential (which isn’t measured by a numerical score; I discuss it in the
description). Finally, you may want to take into consideration the hops’ sta-
bility rating; this rating tells you how well the variety holds up in storage,
which can be important if you buy your hops in bulk and need to store them
over longer periods of time.
One final note: a handful of these varieties are now being grown organically
and are becoming more accessible to homebrewers. Check with your favorite
homebrew supplier for availability.

Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Type of hop: Admiral
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 11.5–14.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: This very new English variety of hop is relatively high in alpha
acids, but it has proven itself to be very versatile as a kettle hop because 
it can replace both high-alpha varieties and dual-purpose (flavoring/
bittering) hops.
Type of hop: Ahtanum
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 7.0–9.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: This hop is used primarily for aroma and moderate bittering in
American Ales, and is appreciated for its citrus zest character. This variety’s
unusual name is derived from an area near Yakima, Washington, where the
first hop farm in the United States was established in 1869!
Type of hop: Amarillo
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 8.0–11.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: This relatively new variety offers an intense floral/citrus 
character that’s ideal for American Ales and IPA styles. It’s similar to Cascade,
but with more of an orange/tangerine aroma and flavor rather than 
grapefruit.
Type of hop: Aurora
Origin: Slovenia
Alpha: 8.0–10.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Bred from the Northern Brewer hop variety at Zalec in 
Slovenia to provide a higher-alpha complement to Styrian Goldings, this 
variety has become known as Super Styrian. The alpha content of the 
Aurora variety is fairly high, but it’s still a versatile kettle hop. Its bittering
characteristics are similar to the Northern Brewer, but without the 
harshness.
371
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of hop: Cascade
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 4.5–7.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: This U.S.-bred hop is a seedling of the English Fuggles variety.
The Cascade is a mild hop with good soft bittering properties and a very dis-
tinctive citrus aroma. The lemony-grapefruity aromatics of this variety are
the hallmarks of a craft brew from the American West Coast.
Type of hop: Centennial
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 9.5–11.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Poor
Description: Formerly called CFJ-90, the Centennial is a relatively new
American variety that’s still in the experimental stage. It’s a cross between
Brewer’s Gold and an undistinguished American variety grown in Washington
State. Though a relatively high-alpha hop, its flavor is rather floral.
Type of hop: Challenger
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 6.5–8.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Released for commercial production in 1972, the Challenger is a
granddaughter of the venerable Northern Brewer and a cousin of the Target
variety. The Challenger was developed in the U.K. but is also grown in small
quantities in Belgium and France. A fruity, spicy hop, the Challenger is a ver-
satile kettle hop for all types of beer.
Type of hop: Chinook
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 12.0–14.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: The Chinook is bred in the U.S. and is a cross between a Peltham
Golding and an undistinguished American variety. It’s a disease-resistant hop
variety used to replace the Bullion and Bramling varieties. Use this very high-
alpha hop in modest amounts because its bittering can be somewhat coarse,
and its aromatics smell like potent grapefruit.
Type of hop: Cluster
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 5.5–8.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Excellent
Description: This variety is one of a few traditional American hops, with
selected clones being propagated to improve yields. As a kettle hop, it’s fairly
372
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

low in alpha acids and is gradually being replaced as new, higher-alpha 
varieties are introduced. The Cluster has a strong aroma but provides well-
balanced bitterness with standard kettle additions.
Type of hop: Columbus
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 13.5–15.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: This American-bred hop is one of a few super-alpha varieties
similar in some respects to the Centennial. Although you can use it as an
aroma hop, it’s rarely explored by homebrewers.
Type of hop: Crystal
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 6.0–8.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: This new variety is a triploid seedling (incapable of forming
seeded cones) developed from the genetics of at least three different hop
varieties, including the Hallertauer, Cascade, and Brewer’s Gold. Its floral-
perfumey character makes it a good choice for late kettle additions, 
particularly for Lagers.
Type of hop: First Gold
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 6.5–8.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: The First Gold is a new, experimental English hop variety. 
This variety is similar to Goldings for its aromatics but also has a higher
alpha content than traditional aroma hops. As such, it’s suitable as a 
general kettle hop and has late-addition and dry-hopping capabilities in all
beer styles.
Type of hop: Fuggles
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 4.0–5.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: First propagated in County Kent by Richard Fuggle in 1875, 
this variety is perhaps the most famous and revered of English hops. This
robust hop contributes all the essential characteristics of flavor, aroma, and
balanced bitterness to Ales. Brewers frequently blend the Fuggles with
Goldings to improve drinkability by adding roundness and fullness to the
flavor. Because it’s a relatively low-alpha hop, a high-hopping rate is neces-
sary to achieve desired bitterness levels. The Fuggles is also used as a 
distinctive dry hop.

Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of hop: Galena
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 12.0–14.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: A derivative of the Brewer’s Gold variety, the Galena hop rapidly
became the dominant high-alpha hop in the U.S. As a kettle hop, it gives a
strong and somewhat floral flavor and balanced bitterness. Because it has a
low oil content, the Galena offers very little in aromatic qualities.
Type of hop: Goldings (Kent)
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 4.5–6.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: The Goldings variety is actually a grouping of traditional English
hop varieties that have been cultivated in southern England for centuries.
Recognized as having the most-typical English aroma and a distinctive flavor,
this hop is in demand for late-addition usage as well as for dry hopping Ales.
The Goldings is also useful for late-hopping Lagers if you require a 
delicate aroma.
Type of hop: Goldings (Styrian)
Origin: Slovenia/U.S.
Alpha: 4.0–6.0
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Good
Description: Grown in Slovenia (mainly in the Savinja Valley around Zatec),
this variety is genetically the same as the Fuggles but has developed distinc-
tive flavor characteristics peculiar to that environment. Styrian Goldings
impart a distinctive, mild bitter flavor, somewhat richer than the English
Goldings variety. Try using this hop for late kettle additions and for 
dry hopping.
Type of hop: Hallertauer
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 4.5–6.0
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Good
Description: Respected as one of the Noble hop varieties, this type is named
for the Hallertau region in Germany where it’s grown. The Hallertauer became
quite popular due to its fine flavoring and aromatic properties. This hop is
the predominant European Lager hop.
Type of hop: Hallertau Hersbrucker
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 4.5–5.5
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Fair
374
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Description: Grown in the Hersbruck area near Nürnberg, this variety now
dominates hop production in the Hallertau region. The Hersbrucker, with its
greater tolerance to wilt, began to overtake the venerable Hallertauer hop,
until it, too, was displaced by newer aroma varieties. The Hersbrucker’s fine
bittering and flavoring is suitable for all mild-flavored Lager beers. I also rec-
ommend it for late kettle additions.
Type of hop: Hallertau Mittelfruh
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 3.5–5.5
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Fair
Description: This hop provides a classic Hallertauer flavor profile with mild
spicy character and is great for European style lagers and German Pilsners.
The name refers to this variety’s middle-early season ripening. The Hallertau
Mittelfruh has been largely replaced with other Hallertau varieties.
Type of hop: Liberty
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 3.5–6.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: Released for general cultivation as recently as 1991, this
Hallertauer seedling is being planted in increasing quantities, particularly 
in Washington State. The Liberty hop variety has many similarities to the
Hallertauer and provides good, flavorful bittering with a fruity/floral character.
Type of hop: Lublin
Origin: Poland
Alpha: 3.0–5.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: Also known as the Lubelski, this Czech hop clone offers many of
the same brewing attributes of the respected Saaz variety. The Lublin is virtu-
ally unknown in the U.S.
Type of hop: Magnum
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 10.0–12.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Bred during the 1980s in Germany’s Hallertau region from the
American Galena hop and a German cultivar, this hop is the first of what is
being called the super-alpha variety. It combines high alpha with a good
yield, and its area of cultivation is increasing substantially. The Magnum has
excellent bittering quality with acceptable aromatic properties. It’s useful for
all types of beer, but make sure that you use it sparingly. Imported Magnum
hops are sometimes referred to as German Magnum, and domestically grown
versions are called Yakima Magnum.
375
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of hop: Mount Hood
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 4.0–6.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: The Mount Hood hop variety is named for the famous volcano in
Oregon. Like the Liberty hop, the Mount Hood is also a Hallertauer seedling,
showing characteristics of both the parent plant and the Hersbrucker variety.
The Mount Hood imparts a clean and soft bitterness to beer, with a distinct
herbal aroma.
Type of hop: Newport
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 12.0–14.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Newport is a very new super alpha hop with an earthy, slightly
resinous aroma sometimes described as newly mown hay. Because of this
hop’s high alpha acid content, I would limit its use to very high gravity beers.
Type of hop: Northdown
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 7.0–10.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: The Northdown is also a descendant of the Northern Brewer.
This hop has a very mild, clean, neutral flavor that can be used in all types of
beer. The high level of oil in the Northdown makes it a desirable dry hop for
full-bodied Ales.
Type of hop: Northern Brewer
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 7.5–9.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: The Northern Brewer was bred in England in the early 1930s and
exported to Germany via Belgium. In Germany, it has been the dominant bit-
tering hop, although it’s now being outclassed by some new varieties. Strong,
robust, and sometimes coarse, Northern Brewer hops provide a good bitter
character if used early in the boil.
Type of hop: Nugget
Origin: U.S./Germany
Alpha: 12.0–14.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Released for general cultivation in 1982, the Nugget variety is a
Brewer’s Gold derivative. This high-alpha hop is grown in the Pacific
Northwest and Germany. Nugget hops impart a pleasant, mild bittering to
beer, along with a subdued aromatic contribution.
376
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Type of hop: Perle
Origin: Germany/U.S.
Alpha: 6.0–9.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Raised from the Northern Brewer variety, Perle hops were
quickly accepted in the Hallertau region and are now grown in significant
quantities in the U.S. Perle hops are similar in contribution to the Hallertauer
variety in imparting fine flavoring and aromatics, sometimes with floral/
fruity effects.
Type of hop: Pride of Ringwood
Origin: Australia
Alpha: 8.0–10.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: This hop variety is grown in the Victoria and Tasmania regions
of Australia and is the dominant variety grown there. This hop is primarily a
bittering variety because poor stability affects the hop’s aromatic properties.
As with all hops grown in Australia, this variety is a pesticide-free crop, which
makes it attractive to those brewers who want to use organic ingredients.
Type of hop: Saaz
Origin: Czechoslovakia
Alpha: 3.0–6.0
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Fair
Description: The true Saaz hops are grown in the hopyards around the
Bohemian towns of Zatec and Louny in the Czech Republic. The Saaz hop is
prized for its very fine, noble aroma and slightly spicy/peppery flavor. This
variety is the traditional hop used in Pilsener-type beers.
Type of hop: Santiam
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 6.0–7.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good 
Description: The Santiam is an aromatic variety crossbred from Swiss
Tettnanger, German Hallertauer, and American Cascade varieties. It can be
used for both Lagers and Ales and is considered similar to, but better than,
the discontinued Ultra variety.
Type of hop: Simcoe
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 12.0–14.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good 
Description: You can use the Simcoe for both aroma and bittering. It has a
wonderful pine-floral character that blends well with Amarillo, Cascade, and
Centennial varieties in American-style Ales.
377
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

Type of hop: Spalt
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 4.5–7.0
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Fair
Description: Grown only in the Spalt region of Germany (southwest of
Nürnberg), this variety has been in production for many generations. It has
long been considered one of the finest of the Noble aromatic varieties. Most
often used as a late-kettle-addition hop, the Spalt imbues beer with a fine, 
traditional, noble aroma, similar in quality to Tettnanger.
Type of hop: Target
Origin: U.K.
Alpha: 10.0–12.5
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: This cousin of the Challenger variety is primarily an English hop
but is also grown in parts of Germany and Belgium. With its strong English
flavor and good bittering qualities, you can use this hop in all types of beer.
The high oil content of the Target hop makes it a logical choice for dry 
hopping. The Target produces floral aromas.
Type of hop: Tettnanger
Origin: Germany
Alpha: 4.0–5.0
Noble (Yes/No): Yes
Stability: Fair
Description: Originally grown only in the Tettnang area of Germany (near 
the Bodensee), considerable quantities of this hop are now produced in the
U.S. The traditional Tettnanger hop has long been regarded as one of the
finest original aroma hops of Germany. The German variety offers a delicate,
noble aroma, and the American-grown variety tends to be slightly coarser.
Tettnanger hops are often used for late kettle additions.
Type of hop: Vanguard
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 5.0–6.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: Originally crossbred in 1982 with American hop and Hallertau
Mittelfruh parentage, this cultivar was released for commercial use in 
1997. It’s prized for its aromatic properties, and you can substitute it for
Hallertau varieties.
378
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Type of hop: Warrior
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 15.0–17.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Good
Description: A bittering hop of recent origin, you can also use this super-
high-alpha hop for late kettle hop additions. Expect aggressive bittering as
well as a unique, interesting citrus and spice character.
Type of hop: Willamette
Origin: U.S.
Alpha: 4.5–7.0
Noble (Yes/No): No
Stability: Fair
Description: The Willamette variety was developed in Oregon in the 1970s as
a seedling of the Fuggles variety. Initially grown to be a Fuggles-replacement
variety, the Willamette is now the dominant aroma hop grown in the Pacific
Northwest. Mild, full bodied, and sometimes spicy, the rounded bittering 
and flavor characteristics of the Willamette deliciously mimic its precursor
the Fuggles.
Yeast: Dry and Liquid
This section lists all the liquid-yeast strains available from two major liquid-
yeast suppliers to the homebrewing industry; I’ve identified their products
not only by the brand name but also by a beer-style-specific identifying 
code number. I’ve also included many other well-known freeze-dried-yeast
suppliers.
You also find a beer style table designed to help you choose an appropriate
liquid-yeast strain to produce any beer style you have in mind. In this table, 
I identify the recommended yeast strains by their code numbers.
Note that I also include a few Mead and Cider yeasts in some of these lists for
your convenience.
Some liquid-yeast-culture suppliers list the rate of attenuation of the yeast.
This rate refers to the percentage of sugar that you can expect a particular
strain to eat during fermentation. (I’ve listed these rates of attenuation 
wherever the information was available.) What this rate of attenuation means
to you as a brewer is that you can choose a yeast strain according to how dry
or sweet you like your beers.

White Labs product number: WLP051
Style of yeast: California Ale V Yeast
Description: This strain from Northern California is fruitier than WLP001 and
slightly more flocculent. Attenuation is lower, resulting in a fuller-bodied beer
than WLP001. Apparent attenuation: 70 to 75 percent
White Labs product number: WLP060
Style of yeast: American Ale Yeast Blend
Description: This blend celebrates the strengths of WLP001: It’s clean, boasts
a neutral fermentation and versatile usage, and adds two other strains that
belong to the same clean/neutral flavor category. The additional strains
create complexity in the finished beer. This blend tastes more Lager-like than
WLP001. It accentuates hop flavors and bitterness — but not to the extreme
of WLP001 — and produces slight sulfur during fermentation. Apparent atten-
uation: 72 to 80 percent
White Labs product number: WLP080
Style of yeast: Cream Ale Yeast Blend
Description: This is a blend of Ale and Lager yeast strains that work together
to create a clean, crisp, light American-Lager-style Ale. You can perceive a
pleasing estery aroma from the Ale yeast contribution, and hop flavors and
bitterness are slightly subdued. The Lager yeast produces slight sulfur during
fermentation. Apparent attenuation: 75 to 80 percent
White Labs product number: WLP099
Style of yeast: Super High Gravity Ale Yeast
Description: This yeast from England can ferment up to 25 percent alcohol. 
It produces an ester character that increases in higher-gravity beers,
although malt character dominates at lower gravities. Apparent attenuation:
>80 percent

White Labs product number: WLP300
Style of yeast: Hefeweizen Ale Yeast
Description: This famous German yeast is a strain used in the production of
traditional, authentic Wheat beers. It produces the banana and clove nose
traditionally associated with German Wheat beers and leaves the desired
cloudy look of traditional German Wheat beers. Apparent attenuation: 72 to
76 percent
388
Homebrewing For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

White Labs product number: WLP320
Style of yeast: American Hefeweizen Ale Yeast
Description: This yeast is used to produce the Oregon-style American
Hefeweizen. Unlike WLP300, this yeast produces a very slight amount of the
banana and clove notes. It produces some sulfur but is otherwise a clean-
fermenting yeast that doesn’t flocculate well, producing a cloudy beer.
Apparent attenuation: 70 to 75 percent
White Labs product number: WLP380
Style of yeast: Hefeweizen IV Ale Yeast
Description: This yeast produces a crisp, drinkable hefeweizen with a strong
clove and phenolic aroma and flavor with minimal banana. It also promotes
refreshing citrus and apricot notes. It’s less flocculent than WLP300, and
sulfur production is higher. Apparent attenuation: 73 to 80 percent
White Labs product number: WLP400

Description: Slightly phenolic and tart, this is the original yeast used to 
produce Wit in Belgium. Apparent attenuation: 74 to 78 percent

in the world, this yeast produces the distinctive fruitiness and plum charac-
teristics. Excellent yeast for high-gravity beers, Belgian Ales, Trappist
dubbels, and tripels. Apparent attenuation: 75 to 80 percent
White Labs product number: WLP530
Style of yeast: Abbey Ale Yeast
Description: Use this yeast to produce Trappist-style and high-gravity beers,
Belgian Ales, dubbels, and tripels. It’s similar to WLP500 but is less fruity and
more alcohol-tolerant (up to 15 percent ABV). Apparent attenuation: 75 to 
80 percent
White Labs product number: WLP550
Style of yeast: Belgian Ale Yeast
Description: Saisons, Belgian Ales, Belgian Reds, Belgian Browns, and White
beers are just a few of the classic Belgian beer styles that you can create with
this yeast strain. Phenolic and spicy flavors dominate the profile, with less
fruitiness than WLP500. Apparent attenuation: 78 to 85 percent
White Labs product number: WLP565
Style of yeast: Belgian Saison I Yeast
Description: This slightly sweet classic Saison yeast from Wallonia produces
earthy, peppery, and spicy notes. With high-gravity saisons, brewers may
want to dry the beer with an alternate yeast added after 75 percent 
fermentation. Apparent attenuation: 65 to 75 percent
389
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

White Labs product number: WLP568
Style of yeast: Belgian Style Saison Ale Yeast Blend

Style of yeast: Oktoberfest/Märzen Lager yeast
Description: This yeast produces a very malty, Bock-like style that doesn’t

Mead and cider yeast
All the following yeast culture descriptions were supplied by the yeast 
producer.
Wyeast #4766 Cider: Crisp and dry fermenting yeast with big, fruity finish.
Creates a nice balance for all types of apples, pears, and other fruits. Allows
fruit character to dominate the profile.
Wyeast #4184 Sweet Mead: One of two strains for mead making. Leaves 
2 to 3 percent residual sugar in most Meads. Rich, fruity profile complements
fruit Mead fermentation. Use additional nutrients for Mead making.
Wyeast #4632 Dry Mead: Best choice for dry Mead. Used in many award-
winning Meads. Low foaming with little or no sulfur production. Use 
additional nutrients for Mead making.
White Labs WLP715 Champagne Yeast: Classic yeast, used to produce cham-
pagne, Cider, dry Meads, dry wines, or to fully attenuate Barley Wines/strong
Ales. Neutral.
393
Appendix: Ingredients: The Building Blocks of Beer

White Labs WLP720 Sweet Mead/Wine Yeast: A wine yeast strain that’s 
less attenuate than WLP715, leaving some residual sweetness. Slightly fruity 
and will tolerate alcohol concentrations up to 15 percent. A good choice for
sweet Mead and Cider, as well as Blush wines, Gewürztraminer, Sauternes,
and Riesling.
White Labs WLP775 English Cider Yeast: Classic Cider yeast. Ferments 
dry, but retains fruit flavor. Produces sulfur during fermentation, but this 
will disappear in first two weeks of aging. Can also be used for wine and 
high-gravity beers.
